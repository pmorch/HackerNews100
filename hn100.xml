A tiny volumetric display!</p><h3>Video Demo</h3><p>

Naturally you can't really feel the volumetric effect on camera. It looks a lot more 3D in real life.</p><h3>Idea</h3><p>
I was recently fortunate enough to find myself in the pub with some very creative and talented people. The discussion turned to electronic candles, and how one might create something that would look like a flickering candle from any angle. I suggested a persistence-of-vision display, but the general consensus was that those require too much in the way of supporting machinery to make them work: bearings, and probably slip rings and so on.</p><p>

Afterwards I had a think and figured that if the motor and battery were small enough, the whole thing could spin. I was ordering some other circuit boards the following day, so I quickly threw together a simple LED matrix board and combined that with the other orders. Small circuit boards from China are essentially free, fast postage is the only thing that matters.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/matrix-boards.jpg" alt="Unassembled matrix boards"></p><p>

Some time ago, I got access to a pick and place machine (a Charmhigh CHM-T36VA). I have it on semi-permanent loan. It's specifically for another project, which I will write up eventually, but my feelings on it can be summarised as follows: Robots are the Future. I've spent enough of my life manually assembling circuit boards that to have a machine that can build a board in seconds right in front of me is bliss.</p><p>

The one drawback to it is that loading the reels takes a long time. For each unique component you have to tediously load the reel, which can sometimes take the best part of 20 minutes. The circuit I borrowed the machine for has 26 unique components, so loading the reels was a full day of work.</p><p>

However. This LED matrix has precisely one component, and so loading the reels was as short as technically possible. Then we can crank out the boards at break-neck speed!</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/matrix-pnp.jpg" alt="Pick and place machine in action"></p><p>

I didn't get a proper stencil, I just laser-etched one in acetate. This project was still very much at the minimal-investment stage, where I'm just idly throwing ideas around. But a generic tiny LED matrix seemed like a worthwhile thing to have a handful of, it will almost certainly come in handy.</p><p>

I did some with 0603 and also some with 0805, as I had some of those already loaded. </p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/matrices.jpg" alt="Assembled matrix boards"></p><p>

If the circuit board design hadn't been a rush job, I'd have also made a circular PCB to support it at a right angle. The pads along the bottom were to solder directly between the boards. When I come to building the next version, that's what I'll do.</p><p>

For now I was playing with ideas. I knew that I wanted a microcontroller with a fair bit of flash memory on it, as we may want a fair bit of volumetric video data. The temptation was to go with a Pico, that's dual core 125MHz (or more) and up to 16MB flash (and importantly, it's cheap). One of the main drawbacks to the Pico is that it's a pain to use the bare RP2040 chip on its own. It has no onboard flash memory, so at the very least you need to wire up a QSPI flash chip, and almost always you'll need an external crystal and a fair amount of supporting caps. The Pico board on its own is far too large for our situation.</p><p>

However, a bunch of people have produced minimal RP2040 boards catering to exactly this sort of situation. Most of them were inappropriate, either too big or not breaking out enough of the GPIO. I found one that looks promising called the Waveshare RP2040-tiny. Here they've essentially cut the pico board in half, putting the bare minimum on the main board and having a secondary board, connected by a flat flex cable, with the USB port, reset and boot buttons.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/rp2040-tiny.jpg" alt="RP2040-tiny board"></p><p>

This seemed perfect for our prototype. It's still a little too big, and still doesn't break out all the GPIO, but we should be able to get by.</p><p>

As for the battery, I immediately grabbed a LIR2450. It's lithium-ion rechargeable, and can deliver well over 100mA. You can get smaller Li-ion batteries, but their capacity and current capability are much reduced. I also get a bit nervous having LIR2032 batteries lying around, as I feel like I'm going to accidently put one into something expecting a CR2032 (same physical dimensions) and possibly break it (LIR batteries are 4.2V fully charged). And besides, that RP2040 board is about 29mm diagonally, so going with a smaller battery isn't going to make the end result any smaller.</p><p>

I 3D-printed the most minimal holder for the battery in PETG.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/battery-holder.jpg" alt="Tiny holder for a LIR2450 battery"></p><p>

I was definitely too frugal here, printing with a wall thickness of 0.5mm. It's printed in two parts, with the top glued on. I think it would make more sense to thicken up all of the parts and print in one go at 90 degrees, which is something I played with later. This 3D printed part is definitely the weakpoint, every time I drop the prototype it breaks and I have to glue it back together.</p><p>

Anyway, we got as far as our first mockup:</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/assembly1.jpg" alt="RP2040 board on top of the battery"></p><p>

That's a TCRT5000 IR sensor I've soldered on, with tiny surface mount resistors. The sensor is a little on the big side but it's all I had to hand. The output is analog, the detector is just a photodiode, but we can use a pullup and connect this straight to a GPIO pin. There are schmitt triggers on the inputs of the RP2040 (that can be disabled through software) so we essentially get a comparator for free.</p><p>

There's a WS2812 LED on the board, connected to GPIO16. I would much rather just have an extra GPIO pin for my matrix, so I snapped off the LED and soldered some enamel wire to it. I wasn't sure if it would be needed but now is the only chance we have to do this.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/assembly2.jpg" alt="Wire soldered to GPIO16"></p><p>

I then started soldering our matrix. The idea with the tabs at the bottom of the matrix was to have slots in the board I connect it to, which would keep everything aligned. Instead, it seems they work well as little legs to keep the board just above the components. I soldered solid-core wire to the pads and wired it up so that everything would be very rigid at the end. It's possible to correct the angle between the boards, but it takes enough force that it won't happen by accident.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/assembly3.jpg" alt="Matrix partly soldered into place"></p><p>

That's half the connections done, there's another ten wires to solder on the back, but before we do that I wanted to wire up the motor.</p><p>

I have a handful of motors approximately the right size. The one I opted for is labelled RF-410CA. Most of the similar motors from CD and DVD drives are all slightly different diameters and different shaft lengths. I also had a think about RPM. Most of these motors have a no-load speed of 5000 to 10000RPM, which is far too fast. We can PWM the speed down, but it also says something about their starting torque. To get to 30FPS, I'd need an RPM of 1800. It's quite hard to make decisions here, because as soon as it starts spinning there will be air-resistance and it will probably hit some equilibrium. Eh, if the motor's no good we can switch it out later.</p><p>

I deadbugged a little sot-23 mosfet and a flyback diode onto our creation.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/assembly4.jpg" alt="Mosfet and diode soldered behind the matrix"></p><p>

The IR LED was wired straight to the power line. Ideally we'd have software control over it to save power while it isn't spinning, but for this prototype I didn't want to waste a GPIO on that. The matrix is 8x10, so 18 GPIO, plus one for the sensor input and one for the motor control, and I also wanted to keep one for monitoring the battery voltage. I think it's possible to wire up a couple more of the GPIO on the RP2040-tiny board which have been broken out as "user mode selection pads" but the current thought process was to not worry and get this to a working prototype as quick as possible.</p><p>

Notice I'm wiring the matrix directly to the GPIO pins. There's no current limiting or driver transistors. The RP2040 can source/sink about 50mA total across all its GPIO. I have learned that the risky, but oh-so-appealing way to drive LEDs from microcontrollers is to skip the current limiting resistors and drive them with PWM. The inherent on-resistance of the GPIO pin is enough to limit current – maybe not to a safe level for continuous illumination, but predictably. As long as you limit the duty cycle it's fine. Here we'll be flickering all of the matrix very quickly, with a lot of careful timing around it. I think it's unlikely we'll overdrive an LED, unless the chip crashes and the matrix freezes.</p><p>

I wired up the rest of the matrix using enamel wire, threading it underneath. We didn't need any further rigidity and it looks pretty cool this way.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/assembly5.jpg" alt="Matrix wired up"></p><p>

There is something surprisingly appealing about the naked wires. It has a kind of cyberpunk vibe. The vibe was only enhanced when I powered up the matrix with a checkerboard test pattern for the first time.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/matrix-test.jpg" alt="Orange glow of the matrix test pattern"></p><p>

I glued our 3D printed battery holder onto the motor, and attached the rest of the prototype with squidgy 3M tape. I then had to shorten the wires to the motor and connect up the battery terminals.</p><p>

I wired the battery's positive terminal straight to VBUS of the board. The RP2040 is behind the 3.3V regulator, but with the battery connected this means that connecting the USB cable would put 5V across the battery terminals. We can worry about that later. For now I just want to know if the hacky prototype has any hope of working.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/assembly6.jpg" alt="Motor, battery and circuit all connected"></p><p>

Amusingly, once I configured it to light up the matrix in response to the IR photodiode, it would light up the matrix whenever the camera flash fired.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/prototype-without-battery.jpg" alt="Prototype with battery removed"></p><p>

With the battery removed you can see my connection to it, just some of the enamel wire stripped and tinned and threaded through a couple of small holes. At this point the battery snapped in with a positive action. It was only after it had been dropped a few times and the plastic cracked that I needed to use a rubber band to hold it in place.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/prototype-without-battery2.jpg" alt="Prototype with battery removed"></p><p>

I drilled a small hole at the back in order to be able to eject the battery, just poke it out with a pointy thing.</p><h3>Software</h3><p>
We monitor the IR sensor and use the time between triggers to set the speed of the matrix display. It's all the usual stuff for a persistence-of-vision display, except with another dimension.</p><p>

One thing I like about the RP2040 is that you can set (or input) every gpio pin in the same clock cycle. STM32 chips, despite having 32 bit processors, group the IO into 16-bit registers that suffer from bus contention if you try to change them all at once.</p><p>

Here we can pre-process everything we need to send to the GPIO and step through it at a speed proportional to the measured rotation.</p><p>

The processor is dual core ARM Cortex-M0. One thing to note is that both cores have separate SysTick hardware. Rather than do this with interrupts, we can use both cores in busy-wait loops. The first core monitors the IR sensor, and uses its systick to measure the exact number of cycles between triggers. The second core waits on the signal to illuminate, and once it gets it, steps through the volumetric buffer using its own systick timer for cycle-accuracy.</p><p>

In terms of motor control, I was reasonably confident we didn't need to do anything too complicated. It's important that the device spins at a constant speed to get a consistent framerate, but it should be fairly self-regulating. Paddle wheels were often used as regulators in old mechanical devices. I made the very simplest speed control logic possible: if the RPM is below 1200, set the motor to 90% power, else set it to 60% power.</p><p>

Later I might upgrade it to proper PID control but so far there's enough inertia and air resistance that the simple control seems totally fine.</p><p>

The first time I got this thing to spin I was giddy with excitement. Within moments I had it drawing a simple volumetric checkerboard pattern. Here's one of the very first tests:</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/first-test.jpg" alt="First illumination, on the messy desk"></p><p>

The plan was to machine a base for this device, with a little signpost that would stick up for the IR sensor to catch glimpses of. I realised it worked fine by just holding a finger near it, so never got around to that part. The motor had a very small pulley attached, which was just enough to let it spin up without falling over. I later laser-cut a disk of delrin, just a push-fit over the shaft, which was only supposed to be a stop-gap until I made something on the lathe.</p><p>

The code steps through the matrix in a columnwise fashion. Looking at the device top-down, each radial line is very slightly spiralled, but that's a lot easier to correct for (if we cared) than having the whole thing be a helix. The duty cycle on the LEDs in the centre is proportionally reduced compared to the periphery.</p><p>

I quickly got this thing displaying a static test volume. It was only a matter of time before I let it fall on the floor. The 3D print cracked along the glue line.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/cracked-open.jpg" alt="3D printed part cracked open"></p><p>

No worries, we can just keep gluing it back together. It's invincible!</p><h3>Battery Level</h3><p>
One thing that worried me is that we have no protection circuit for the battery. If it drops much below 3V it will get permanently damaged. (In practice the limit is more like 2.7V, but it depends on the cell. I've destroyed a few through this process.) Most lithium batteries have protection circuits built in, that will disconnect when it reaches a dangerously low level. Not so, with a bare cell. At the very least I wanted to monitor the battery voltage so we can alert and fail to run if we think it's too low.</p><p>

The normal way of monitoring supply voltage level is to add a potential divider to get it into a readable range of the ADC. The Pico boards I think normally have this wired to one of their GPIO, but not the RP2040-tiny. I added two 100K resistors to power and ground to our last available GPIO.</p><p>

The problem is, there's no reference voltage on the Pico. There's an external pin (not broken out on the RP2040-tiny) that can be used, but if the ADC reference is just its supply voltage, then when the supply voltage dips we won't be able to detect that. At least, not well.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/vbat2.png" alt="Schematic of VBat monitoring connection"></p><p>

The 3.3V LDO regulator has part number RT9193-33, and a dropout of 220mV at 300mA. That means when the battery voltage reaches 3.52V, our RP2040 supply voltage will start to droop as well. The ADC reading as a function of battery voltage will end up something like this:</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/vbat.png" alt="Plot of ADC reading vs battery voltage"></p><p>

Of course, the dropout voltage is a function of current load, so it isn't even as predictable as that. For this prototype, I made the device show a warning when it reaches just under 3.6V. That's the only thing we can really do here. For the next version, we'll add a reference voltage. It may even be possible to connect the ADC ref to the Pico's internal 1.8V regulator. That would be enough.</p><h3>Battery charger</h3><p>
The concept was to pop out the LIR2450 when it gets low and stick it into a standalone charger. I bought a standalone charger. It broke the very first time I used it.</p><p>

I was pretty pissed off that a brand new charger would let me down (it wasn't even the cheapest!). And this, at my most excited moment, ready to display more volumetric data! Woe is me!</p><p>

I 3D printed another battery holder, this time in the other plane. The spring tabs are technically flexing in the weakest direction, but they're generous enough and the wall thickness is all 1mm now.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/new-battery-holder.jpg" alt="New battery holder"></p><p>

I wasn't planning to use this for the display, this is just my new battery charger. I set the bench power supply to current limit of 50mA and constant voltage of 4.2V. This is enough to charge a single lithium-ion cell. The constant current is on the conservative side, I wasn't sure if this was a 120mAh battery or a 60mAh battery. It's best to charge no faster than about 1C unless the battery says otherwise. But it's generally never a problem to charge slower than 1C.</p><p>

This got me fired up again, and the volumetric journey continued. But before we resume the narrative, let me just add that removing the battery and connecting to a power supply is the least convenient way of charging the device, especially after the prototype cracked and I had to add that rubber band to stop the battery flying out.</p><p>

The RP2040-tiny USB adapter board was still being used to load code onto the chip. If we build a kind of USB-intercept board, we can lift the 5V line, and expose the pins for the battery. This sits between the USB cable from the PC to RP2040-tiny programming board.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/usb-adapter1.jpg" alt="USB intercept board"></p><p>

Now we can connect the power supply to the battery without removing it from the prototype. The data lines are still connected underneath, so we can program it with the battery in place as well.</p><p>

I realised that soldering this up was a waste of time as I could have simply put wires on the RP2040-tiny adapter board.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/rp2040-tiny-battery-adapt.jpg" alt="Power lines soldered to the RP2040-tiny adapter board"></p><p>

However in the mad frenzy induced by the working volumetric display, and the kicking of myself for only having one LIR2450 in stock, I found this still too inconvenient for rapid development. In a drawer somewhere, I had some lithium-ion charging ICs. It took me a moment to find them. These are quite nice quality ones, which cost about 90p each. The part number is BQ21040DBVR. I went back to that USB intercept board, and smashed the charging IC into the middle of it.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/usb-adapter2.jpg" alt="USB intercept with charging IC"></p><p>

With this, we can leave the programming cable connected and it will be charging the battery while we think.</p><p>

Of course, it won't ever fully charge the battery this way because the prototype never turns off. The IR LED alone is constantly drawing about 9mA. There was a very bright power LED on the RP2040-tiny adapter board, I swapped out the resistor to a 20K to stop it wasting power there. But still, I think even when the prototype isn't running it's drawing about 15mA overall. The charging IC, in the constant-voltage phase, will wait until the charging current drops to 0.1C. As our charging current is set to 54mA, that'll never happen. Also, with the voltage drop across the cable the battery probably won't get above 4.1V. None of this really matters, it's just stuff to keep in mind for the next version.</p><p>

At last we could start doing fluid simulations!</p><h3>Generating volumetric data</h3><p>
We need to create our volumetric data in 3D polar coordinates, that is, r, theta and z.</p><p>

I started with a wireframe cube, which should at least be somewhat recognisable. I deliberately rotated it to be on-end, to maximise the awkwardness of displaying it. Really I suppose we should write a vector display routine for the device, that would perform some kind of 3D polar coordinate Bresenham interpolation. There's plenty of info out there about applying Bresenham to 3D, and drawing circles, but we want to draw straight lines in polar coordinates. This sounds like a fun thing to think about but for now let's focus on exporting polar voxel data from Blender.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/blender1.jpg" alt="Wireframe cube in Blender"></p><p>

That's the default cube with a wireframe modifier. To rotate a cube to be on-end, with a corner facing directly upwards, we need to first rotate x by 45 degrees, then rotate y by <code>atan(1/sqrt(2))</code>. One of the lovely things about Blender is you can just type in formulas anywhere.</p><p>

To get slices of this wireframe cube, I added another cube, reshaped it to be somewhat slice-like, and did a boolean modifier between them. I then parented both the camera and this slice to an empty, and animated the empty's Z rotation. </p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/blender2.jpg" alt="Slice of the wireframe cube"></p><p>

I configured the camera projection to be orthographic, and its resolution to be our tiny 8x10. I set the background to black and the cube's material to emissive. In the compositor, we can use a colour ramp to threshold this. The volumetric display currently has only a bit-depth of 1, so each voxel is just on or off. Thresholding it here lets us visually pick the best cutoff.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/blender-compositor.jpg" alt="Screenshot of compositor"></p><p>

"Render animation" now generates 24 images, 24 slices of the wireframe cube. I used a quick python script to chew those up into a header file that can be included in the code.</p><p>

In Blender, not only can any input accept a formula, and not only can virtually all of them can be keyframed, you can also set up a driver. Rather than resolve the formula as you enter it, it will recalculate the result for each frame. So instead of keyframing the rotation of the camera and manually setting it to linear interpolation, I just typed in <code>(frame/24)*2*pi</code> which will loop indefinitely. For the y-rotation of the cube, I now typed in <code>floor(frame/24)*pi/24</code> so it will rotate a fraction for each full loop of the camera.</p><p>

<video src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/cube-rotate.webm" controls="" loop="" width="960" height="540">Sorry, your browser does not support .webm videos</video></p><p>

Honestly it would have been fine for the rotation to be continuous, but I wanted each frame of data to be discrete, just in case we wanted to adjust playback speed based on motor RPM.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/spinning1.jpg" alt="Volumetric display of the rotating cube"></p><p>

You'll simply have to take my word for it that the display seems a lot more three-dimensional in real life. Looking at the pictures and watching the video it does seem just like a bunch of random dots illuminated. If only you, dear reader, had a volumetric display to experience it on!</p><h3>Fluid simulations</h3><p>
Running a fluid simulation in Blender is both easy and difficult. Easy to get started, difficult to get just right. There are an awful lot of parameters involved.</p><p>

Liquid simulation is slightly easier to port to the volumetric display as it's trivial to convert the fluid particles to a mesh. In theory, we should be able to run a fluid simulation at 1/24th speed, and use the same technique as above to extract polar volumetric data.</p><p>

Unfortunately using extreme parameters like a very slow time scale leads to instabilities. There doesn't seem to be a straightforward way to play back a simulation at a slower rate, and the very slow simulation speed looks entirely wrong when sped up. I did fiddle around with this for a while with no luck. On the plus side, we're targeting a very low spatial resolution, so the fluid simulations are all fast enough to run in real-time on my desktop machine.</p><p>

I looked into other ways to render the volumetric data. There's a feature known as Multi-view, or Stereoscopy, that's intended for rendering 3D video. This lets you add two cameras and render a scene from both perspectives simultaneously. It's possible to add any number of cameras, and output all of them based on their naming suffix. I'm not sure if there's a quick way to add 24 cameras and evenly rotate them (sadly you can't apply an array modifier to a camera, I'm not sure if anyone has ever asked for that before) but a further problem with this tactic is that we also need the boolean modifiers of our slices to be rendered at the same time.</p><p>

Instead of the boolean modifier and a slice, we could cheat a little and use the built-in clipping distances. By setting the camera to only render a 0.1 slice of the scene we get almost the right output. The problem is that only surfaces are drawn, not solid fill for the clipped objects. I thought that maybe applying volumetric material to the objects could make them at least partially filled, but after playing about for a bit I had no luck.</p><p>

Instead, let's go for a more generic (but more involved) approach: just write a python script. In the scripting tab in blender, I wrote the following:</p><pre>import bpy
import os
from math import pi
 
obj = bpy.data.objects['Empty']
output_path = bpy.context.scene.render.filepath
 
for i in range(24):
  obj.rotation_euler[2] = (i/24)*2*pi
  bpy.context.scene.render.filepath = os.path.join(output_path, f"###_{i:02}.png")
  bpy.ops.render.render(animation=True)
 
bpy.context.scene.render.filepath = output_path
</pre><p>

This way we run the fluid simulation in real time, and simply re-render the whole animation 24 times with different rotations of the Empty (parent to the camera and the slice).</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/fluid-render-slice.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a single fluid slice render"></p><p>

The concept proven, I ploughed ahead with the fire simulation. The way to render this is basically the same but with a couple more steps. We set up our fire simulation, and then bake it in OpenVDB format. Here I set a small cube on fire.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/fire-simulation.jpg" alt="Fire simulation"></p><p>

Then start over, and import the OpenVDB data back into Blender. We can then create a new mesh and apply a Volume to Mesh modifier on it, which lets us threshold the volume data. Finally, another boolean modifier with our camera slice, and re-run the script above.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/fire-sim-display.jpg" alt="Fire simulation on the display"></p><p>

Again, I feel the photograph doesn't really capture the feeling here, but you hopefully get the idea.</p><p>

It occurs to me that the LED alignment could be corrected for in software, if it were predictable. We could offset the boolean slice either closer or further away from the camera, so that it doesn't spin around the exact centre. If it matched the movement of the real display we should be golden. Similarly, instead of a stretched cube, we could make it a slightly curved shape to compensate for the matrix scanning pattern as the board rotates. At this level of resolution however, I don't think any of these improvements would be visible.</p><p>

The only thing that really matters is that illuminating an individual voxel near the perimeter should look like a single dot, not a double dot from some angles. You can see it in the image below, where the voxel nearest the camera is elongated because the two illuminations as the matrix rotates didn't quite line up:</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/display-text.jpg" alt="Display showing text"></p><p>

The letter "m" in the centre is perfectly clear, because I deliberately cheated there. To make the text readable from all directions, the text voxels are rendered differently. I made it so the text scrolls in the readable orientation regardless of if you're looking at the front or back of the display. Anyway this voxel discrepancy can only really be noticed on the periphery of the display, where both illuminations are visible at once.</p><h3>Conclusion, for now</h3><p>
There is plenty of work to do on my fire simulation, but perhaps I'll delay a little until I crank out the next prototype which might be a little better aligned and a little higher-resolution.</p><p>

If I had a tiny slide-switch in stock, I would have added it to this prototype, to disconnect the battery without removing it. I started searching my boxes for something suitable before realising I could simply insert a small piece of acetate between the battery and the contact, like they do with coin cells for IR remotes and so on. That works fine.</p><p>

On the subject of IR remotes, it would be quite nice to have a remote control for this. We already have an IR sensor, although it's not a demodulating type. As shown in the video, I simply advance to the next mode after a timeout of no activity.</p><p>

Here are some vanity shots of the device.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/candle/final1.jpg" alt="Vanity shot of prototype"></p><p>

The IR is of course totally invisible to the naked eye, but the digital camera picks it up as a faint purple glow.</p><p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/02/nsa_held_hostage/">https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/02/nsa_held_hostage/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38498090">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Is the NSA buying up Americans' location and browsing data? Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) is tired of asking and has now moved to block the confirmation of a new NSA director until he gets answers.</p>
<p>"The American people have a right to know whether the NSA is conducting warrantless domestic surveillance of Americans in a manner that circumvents the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution," Wyden said in a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-nsa-must-answer-whether-it-is-buying-americans-location-data-and-web-browsing-records-before-new-director-is-confirmed">statement</a> on Thursday submitted to the congressional record.</p>
<p>"Particularly as Congress is currently debating extending Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, Congress must be able to have an informed public debate about the scope of the NSA's warrantless surveillance of Americans."</p>

    

<p>As we've previously <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/21/us_police_data_broker_info/">reported</a>, plenty of personal information is available for purchase from commercial data brokers by US government agencies without a warrant. The Fourth Amendment provides Americans safeguards from unreasonable search and seizures - a protection some, including Senator Wyden, would argue the Feds (and cops to that matter) violate if or when they acquire this info without a warrant.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Congress must be able to have an informed public debate about the scope of the NSA's warrantless surveillance of Americans</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These data brokers harvest personal data from all sorts of places, mainly apps <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.eff.org/issues/location-data-brokers">reselling</a> your location and other info, and then bundle it up and peddle to interested parties.</p>
<p>Wyden said he was told by Uncle Sam's Defense Intelligence Agency that it, for one, was purchasing American citizens' location data, and he made that point public in early 2021. He said he further pressed the Pentagon for the names of other military agencies buying records of people's whereabouts, browsing histories, and other personal matters, and in March that year got the answers he wanted – but the disclosure was marked "controlled unclassified information" (<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.dcsa.mil/Industrial-Security/Controlled-Unclassified-Information-CUI/">CUI</a>). The senator took that to mean he couldn't share it.</p>

        


        

<p>CUI is not classified information, as its name indicates, but it should, generally speaking, be protected with access controls and not widely disseminated. Wyden is clearly not a fan of this labeling, which he described as a "made up designation with no basis in law." CUI was created by an <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2010/11/09/2010-28360/controlled-unclassified-information">executive order</a> from President Obama in 2010.</p>
<p>"The administration is abusing the CUI designation to keep this unclassified information from the American public," Wyden continued.</p>

        

<p>So now the senator has placed a hold on Lieutenant General Timothy Haugh's confirmation as NSA director until the spying nerve-center confirms or denies (presumably under an unclassified designation) that it is buying up citizens' location data and/or browser histories without a warrant. The senator wants a simple yes or no.</p>
<p>This won't guarantee answers, however. It does mean the NSA will either need to satisfy Wyden's request, or Congress will need to hold a procedural vote to push through the confirmation.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/22/wyden_hemisphere_letter/">US govt pays AT&amp;T to let cops search Americans' phone records – 'usually' without a warrant</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/08/section_702_reform_legislation/">Uncle Sam snooping on US folks? Not without a warrant, lawmakers agree</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/01/traveler_privacy_protection_act/">Senate bill aims to stop Uncle Sam using facial recognition at airports</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/01/trickbot_dev_guilty_plea/">US readies prison cell for another Russian Trickbot developer</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In his statement Wyden makes clear his objections to Haugh's promotion to the rank of general and nomination to the NSA directorship aren't personal nor related to his qualifications. The congressman simply wants Uncle Sam to open up a little.</p>
<p>Senator Wyden isn't the only one who's run into opposition trying to obtain more information on US domestic intelligence gathering efforts. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has filed freedom of information act requests and lawsuits to get this evidence.</p>
<p>Wyden's latest effort comes as Congress weighs up the future of FISA Section 702, which is due to expire at the end of this year unless it's reauthorized, and in certain circumstances allows government snoops to analyze US persons' private communications without a warrant. While lawmakers are likely to renew the controversial intelligence tool, many on both sides of the aisle would like to see additional safeguards added.</p>

        

<p>One <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/08/section_702_reform_legislation/">proposed</a> reauthorization bill, which has already received pushback from the White House, includes several surveillance reforms, including one requiring warrants for government purchases of private information from data brokers. A rival and much more spy-friendly bill has also <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/29/section_702_reauthorization_bill/">been introduced</a>. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main id="content"><div><p>by <a href="https://kilianvalkhof.com/">Kilian Valkhof</a> published on <time datetime="2023-12-02">Dec 02, 2023</time></p><p>Please don't feel antagonised by the title of this article. I don't hate JavaScript, I love it. I write bucketloads of it every single day. But I also love CSS, and I even love <s>JSX</s> HTML. The reason I love all three of these technologies is something called:</p><h2 id="the-rule-of-least-power">The rule of least power</h2><p>It's one of the core principles of web development and it means that you should <strong>Choose the least powerful language suitable for a given purpose</strong>.</p><p>On the web this means preferring HTML over CSS, and then CSS over JS. JS is the most versatile language out of the three because you're the one describing how the browser should act, but it can also break, it can fail to load and it takes extra resources to download, parse and run. It is also very easy to exclude keyboard users and people using assistive technologies with it.</p><p>In contrast to JS, which is imperative, HTML and CSS are declarative. You tell the browser <em>what</em> to do, now <em>how</em> to do it. That means the browser gets to choose how to do it, and it can do it in the most efficient way possible.</p><p>Because HTML and CSS features are handled by the browser they can be more performant, more native, more adaptable to user preferences and in general, more accessible. That doesn't mean it will always be (especially when it comes to accessibility) but when the browser does the heavy lifting for you, your end users will generally have a better experience.</p><h2 id="but-i-need-js-for-that!">But I need JS for that!</h2><p>You might be thinking “All the things I use JS for, I <em>need</em> JS for”. That might be true, but it's good to know that both browser makers and specification writers have been porting a lot of functionality over to CSS and HTML that up to a few years ago needed JS. And that's what this article is about.</p><p>The tricky thing with the web is that once you learn how to build something there is never a reason to have to learn it again. That's the contract we have: the web is backwards compatible. (Very few exceptions apply, but the first web page still runs fine in all modern browsers.)</p><p>That also means that the solution you learned once becomes part of your toolbox, and you can keep re-implementing it and everytime it will still work. So the examples I'm going to give below are cool (that's why I'm listing them) but what I want you to take away from this article is that just because you <em>know</em> something needs JavaScript, doesn't mean it still does. You can make better websites if you test those assumptions every now and then.</p><h2 id="custom-switches">Custom Switches</h2><p>We'll start this article off with something we've all had to implement at some point, custom switches. Instead of using a regular checkbox, the design calls for a nice looking switch. Instead of reaching for a JS solution with divs, onclick handlers and internal state, we're going to make use of a regular checkbox and the <code>:checked</code> pseudo class. Here's ther HTML we're going to use:</p><pre><code><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>label</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>input</span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>checkbox<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>  My awesome feature</span><br><span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>label</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre><p>There's a label element, and inside it a checkbox. The nice thing about this is that the browser is already doing things for us. Because the input is inside the label, the browser has associated them and now we can click anywhere on the label to toggle the checkbox, no onclick handler in sight. The browser gives us this for free. Feature-wise, we're done.</p><p><label> My awesome feature</label></p><p>Of course, designers may not like the way this looks and we want to create a great looking custom switch. So let's add a bunch of CSS:</p><pre><code><span><span>input</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>appearance</span><span>:</span> none<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>position</span><span>:</span> relative<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>display</span><span>:</span> inline-block<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>background</span><span>:</span> lightgrey<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>height</span><span>:</span> 1.65rem<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>width</span><span>:</span> 2.75rem<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>vertical-align</span><span>:</span> middle<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>border-radius</span><span>:</span> 2rem<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>box-shadow</span><span>:</span> 0px 1px 3px #0003 inset<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>transition</span><span>:</span> 0.25s linear background<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span><span>input::before</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>content</span><span>:</span> <span>""</span><span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>display</span><span>:</span> block<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>width</span><span>:</span> 1.25rem<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>height</span><span>:</span> 1.25rem<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>background</span><span>:</span> #fff<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>border-radius</span><span>:</span> 1.2rem<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>position</span><span>:</span> absolute<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>top</span><span>:</span> 0.2rem<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>left</span><span>:</span> 0.2rem<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>box-shadow</span><span>:</span> 0px 1px 3px #0003<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>transition</span><span>:</span> 0.25s linear transform<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>transform</span><span>:</span> <span>translateX</span><span>(</span>0rem<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>All the specifics of the styling here don't matter as much, but I want you to take a look at that first rule: <code>appearance: none</code>.</p><p>Form elements, along with images, are something called "replaced content". That means they're not really part of your HTML, but supplied by the browser. When the browser renders your HTML and finds replaced content, it leaves a box for it, and then replaces that box with the actual content. This is why, for example, images and form elements can't have pseudo-elements: they get replaced when the browser replaces the entire element.</p><p><code>appearance</code> is a way of telling the browser to stop doing that. It tells the browser: "Thanks, but I want to style my own form control". And that then allows is to use the <code>::before</code> pseudo-element. The input itself is now the background of our switch, and the <code>::before</code> pseudo-element is the little dot inside of it that does the toggling.</p><p><label> My awesome feature</label></p><p>Clicking this still checks and unchecks the checkbox, but because we replaced the element we need to do the work of making that visible ourselves. That's where the <code>:checked</code> pseudo-class comes in:</p><pre><code><span><span>:checked</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>background</span><span>:</span> green<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span><span>:checked::before</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>transform</span><span>:</span> <span>translateX</span><span>(</span>1rem<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>When you click the checkbox, that <code>:checked</code> pseudo-class starts to match and that causes the styling to update.</p><p><label> My awesome feature</label></p><p>So we have a great looking custom switch using native HTML elements and a bit of CSS, but we're not done yet. While for mouse users it's really clear which form control they're interacting with (since they're pointing at it and clicking), for people using a keyboard that's not so easy.</p><p>I'm sure you're familiar with this bit of CSS. To get rid of that ugly, dotted, boxy outline.</p><pre><code><span><span>input:focus</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>outline</span><span>:</span> none<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>If you're reading this, know that's not a good idea. But how do we make it look, well, nicer? Here too browsers have updated to make things better for us. The <code>outline</code> now follows the border-radius of an element, and we can also offset it away, or inside of, the element:</p><pre><code><span><span>input:focus-visible</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>outline</span><span>:</span> 2px solid dodgerblue<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>outline-offset</span><span>:</span> 2px<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>Now, when a user interacts with an element using the keyboard (you cna try pressing the spacebar after clicking it, or tabbing to it), <code>:focus-visible</code> will match (it won't when using a mouse) and they get a good looking, blue outline slightly around the element.</p><p><label> My awesome feature</label></p><p>Lastly, I want you to replace that <code>outline: none</code> with something else:</p><pre><code><span><span>input:focus</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>outline-color</span><span>:</span> transparent<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><p>This will have the same result: Instead of the outline not being visible because it's hidden, it's not visible because it's transparent. For users that have high contrast mode (also called forced colors) turned on however, that outline becomes visible again because in high contrast mode, that transparent color gets replaced with a color the user chose, helping them see what they're interacting with even if they use a mouse.</p><p>This article isn't long enough to also go into what forced-colors does but if you want to learn more check out my article <a href="https://polypane.app/forced-colors/">forced colors explained</a>.</p><h2 id="datalist-a-native-autosuggest">Datalist, a native autosuggest</h2><p>Instead of installing <code>$your-framework-autosuggest</code>, try out datalist in your next project. Datalist is the browsers built-in way of showing a list of options as a user types into an input.</p><pre><code><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>input</span> <span>list</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>frameworks<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>datalist</span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>frameworks<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>option</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Bootstrap<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>option</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>option</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Tailwind CSS<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>option</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>option</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Foundation<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>option</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>option</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Bulma<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>option</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>option</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Skeleton<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>option</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>datalist</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre><p>To use it, you add a datalist element with an ID and a set of options to your HTML. Don't worry, the element won't be visible. Then you use the <code>list</code> attribute on an input to associate the two.</p><p><datalist id="frameworks"><option>Bootstrap</option><option>Tailwind CSS</option><option>Foundation</option><option>Bulma</option><option>Skeleton</option></datalist></p><p>As a user now types into the input, the browser will show the datalist as a dropdown, automatically filtering the options as the user types. Because it's a regular input though, users still have the option to type in their own value. Lastly, they can see all of the options by selecting the input and using the arrow keys to navigate the list, or clicking the dropdown icon the browser adds.</p><h2 id="a-color-picker-that-does-more">A color picker that does more</h2><p>There are a ton of good looking color pickers out there, with nice canvas UIs and sliders that are built with 100s of lines of JavaScript. But did you know that you can also use a native color picker?</p><pre><code><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>label</span><span>&gt;</span></span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>input</span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>color<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span> Color <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>label</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre><p>This single line of HTML also give you a color picker with a nice UI, already saving you a bunch of JS. But because we're letting the browser handle it, we actually get more functionality for free. In Chromium browsers, that native color picker also lets you pick a color, not just from your own site but from anywhere on the screen. Pretty neat!</p><p><label for="color">Color</label><br></p><p>A quick note here is that even though browsers show a nice color picker, your users might not all be able to use it. So offering a different way of picking a color (like a regular text input) is still a good idea.</p><h2 id="accordions">Accordions</h2><p>Accordions are a great way of making a page with a lot of content more structured and uncluttered by keeping content out of the way until a user needs it. And browsers give them to you for free with the <code>details</code> and <code>summary</code> elements:</p><pre><code><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>details</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>summary</span><span>&gt;</span></span>My accordion<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>summary</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span>My accordion content<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>details</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre><div data-demo="Accordion"><details><summary>My accordion</summary><p>My accordion content</p></details></div><p>By default everything inside a <code>details</code> element is hidden except for the <code>summary</code>. Then when a user clicks the <code>summary</code> element the browser will show the rest of the content.</p><p>What you'll often see is that one of the accordion items is already open, and the rest are closed. You can do that with the <code>open</code> attribute:</p><pre><code><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>details</span> <span>open</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>summary</span><span>&gt;</span></span>My accordion<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>summary</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span>My accordion content<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>details</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre><div data-demo="Accordion that starts open"><details open=""><summary>My accordion</summary><p>My accordion content</p></details></div><p>If you come from the React world, you might look at this code and think “Well that's great, now it has the <code>open</code> prop and isn't going to close anymore“ but luckily, that's not the case. That <code>open</code> attribute is only the starting state, and will update when a user interacts with the accordion.</p><p>When it comes to styling, the <code>details</code> element also has you covered. That little triangle (that your designer will want to replace the instant they see it) is a <code>::marker</code> pseudo-element that you can style:</p><pre><code><span><span>summary::marker</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>font-size</span><span>:</span> 1.5em<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>content</span><span>:</span> <span>"📬"</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span><br><span><span>[open] summary::marker</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>font-size</span><span>:</span> 1.5em<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>content</span><span>:</span> <span>"📭"</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><div data-demo="Accordion with styled markers"><details><summary>My accordion</summary><p>My accordion content</p></details></div><p>Keep in mind that changing the content can affect how assistive technologies announce your accordion. Read Manuels article on that here: <a href="https://www.matuzo.at/blog/2023/details-summary">details/summary inconsistencies</a>.</p><p>The marker pseudo-element can't be styled as extensively as other elements (many CSS properties do not work on it, like positioning it in a completely different place), but you can replace its content, for example with emoji, or set a background color or image and change it's font size.</p><p>With the <code>open</code> attribute you can easily give it different styling from the closed state.</p><p>Lastly, we want to do something about that summary element. It's clickable, but unlike a link it doesn't get a pointer cursor, and unlike a button it, well, doesn't look like a button. So I think we should add a hover and focus state to it and help our visitors realise that it's clickable:</p><pre><code><span>summary:hover,<br>summary:focus</span> <span>{</span><br><span>  <span>cursor</span><span>:</span> pointer<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>background</span><span>:</span> deeppink<span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><div data-demo="Accordion with indication on hover"><details><summary>My accordion</summary><p>My accordion content</p></details></div><p>I'm sidestepping the “only links should have pointer cursors” discussion here, the main point I'm making is that you need to do <em>something</em>.</p><h2 id="dialog-modals">Dialog modals</h2><p>Sometimes you need to inform the user about something, or ask them something or get them to confirm something. In JavaScript, that's what <code>alert()</code>, <code>prompt()</code> and <code>confirm()</code> do. But they have a pretty big downside: they lock the main thread, meaning your page can't do anything else. They're also browser-native, so you can't style them to work with your design.</p><p>Building your own dialog is also asking for trouble: you need to keep the focus inside the dialog for accessibility, announce it's modal-ness, make sure users can't exit it accidentally, and you'll have to fight with whatever chat widget occupied the z-index of 2147483647 (if you know you know).</p><p>So that's why browsers now come with a native dialog element:</p><pre><code><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>dialog</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>form</span> <span>method</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>dialog<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>h3</span><span>&gt;</span></span>This is a pretty dialog<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>h3</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>submit<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>Close<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>  <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>form</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>dialog</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre><p>This element isn't shown by default and, for now, this is where I'm going to cheat a little and use JavaScript:</p><pre><code><span>document<span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>"button"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>"click"</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  document<span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>"dialog"</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>showModal</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><div data-demo="A native dialog"><dialog id="dialog1"><form method="dialog"><h3>This is a pretty dialog</h3></form></dialog></div><p>Now there's changes in the works that will let you open dialogs without JavaScript, but they're not fully specced yet, let alone implemented. So for now, we need to use JavaScript to open the dialog. But that's it, the rest is all native HTML and CSS.</p><p>The dialog element has a <code>showModal()</code> function that it exposes and with it, you open the dialog. This dialog is opened on something called the <code>top-layer</code>, which is a new concept in browsers. For a primer, check out the explainer on MDN: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Top_layer">Top layer</a>.</p><p>The top layer is a new layer that's separate from your HTML, and you can "promote" elements to it. That means that elements on the top layer will always be above everything else, regardless of the z-index of an element and stacking context nesting.</p><p>Now that it's open though, you might notice that the browser doesn't give you any UI. The dialog is pretty much a div (not a button!) and it's up to you to provide the UI for closing. That's what the form in the code above does. You might've noticed it has a method of "dialog". When this form gets submitted, the browser takes that as a signal to close the dialog again.</p><p>With that, you can also create confirmation dialogs by providing two buttons, each with each own values:</p><pre><code><span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>dialog</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>  <span><span><span>&lt;</span>form</span> <span>method</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>dialog<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span>Tabs or spaces?<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>submit<span>"</span></span> <span>value</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>wrong<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>Tabs<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>type</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>submit<span>"</span></span> <span>value</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>correct<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>Spaces<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span>  <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>form</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span><br><span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>dialog</span><span>&gt;</span></span></span></code></pre><p>The button that a user clicked can be found by listening to the <code>close</code> event on the dialog and reading it's 'returnValue' property:</p><pre><code><span>dialog<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>"close"</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>dialog<span>.</span>returnValue<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>If you have any other form data in there you can also read that as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData"><code>formData</code></a>.</p><p>Because the dialog is essentially a div as far as styling it concerned, you can style it however you want. The browser will automatically place it in the middle of the screen for you, but everything else is up to you.</p><p>Dialog also comes with a new pseudo-element called <code>::backdrop</code>. That's the layer that sits between the dialog and the rest of the page, and you can style it to e.g. dim the rest of the page or otherwise direct a users attention to the dialog. For example, you can overlay a white layer and blur the page:</p><pre><code><span><span>dialog::backdrop</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>background</span><span>:</span> #fff5<span>;</span></span><br><span>  <span>backdrop-filter</span><span>:</span> <span>blur</span><span>(</span>4px<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>}</span></span></code></pre><div data-demo="Dialog with styled backdrop"><dialog id="dialog3"><form method="dialog"><h3>This is a dialog with a styled backdrop</h3></form></dialog></div><p>Just like the dialog element itself, the backdrop is positioned by the browser, so you won't need to worry about scrolling, fixed elements and browser resizing. It's all handled for you by the browser.</p><h2 id="in-closing">In closing</h2><p>I hope you found a few things in this article that made you realise you can use a little bit less javascript in your next project. Whenever you change a known battle-tested implementation to something new it's good to test it, especially when it comes to accessibility, to make sure that you're not excluding anyone.</p><p>There are dozens more examples I could've added into this article, here are just some you can look into:</p><ul><li>Native smooth scrolling with <code>scroll-behavior: smooth</code> (but only when <code>prefers-reduced-motion: no preference</code> matches!),</li><li>Native carousels with scroll-snap,</li><li>"In-view" elements with <code>position: sticky</code></li><li>…Not to name the whole concept of container queries.</li></ul><p>And if we look into the future, we're getting even more cool things:</p><ul><li>Scroll driven animations</li><li>Masonry layouts without masonry.js but with <code>grid-template-rows: masonry</code></li><li>A fully stylable <code>select</code> with the new <code>selectlist</code> element (where you can style each part of a select without destroying all the native functionality it comes with)</li><li>The <code>:has()</code> selector that's going to eliminate a whole class of JS selection</li></ul><p>This article is an adaption of a conference talk I gave that goes into more detail on these and other topics, and you can watch it here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTMUJu26b7Q">Stop Using JavaScript for That: Moving Features from JS to CSS and HTML.</a></p><p>So let me re-iterate the main point of this article:</p><p>Just because you <em>know</em> something needs JavaScript, doesn't mean it still does.

<p><em><em>an addendum has been posted, read it <a href="https://alyx.sh/posts/deploying-the-ccr2004-1g-2xs-pcie/">here</a></em></em></p>
<p><strong><em>2023/12/02 - Hello, Hacker News! Check out these pictures of my cat: <a href="https://emma.pet/">https://emma.pet</a></em></strong></p>
<p>Back in February, Mikrotik announced the CCR2004-1G-2XS-PCIe, a peculiar 25gbps NIC.
They’ve thrown an entire router into a PCIe NIC. But why?</p>
<h2 id="wait-why">Wait, why?</h2>
<p>Mikrotik’s product listing has illustrations that suggest using it in a file server and a workstation, with a copper DAC in between. For something like a basic NIC, sure, that makes sense. But why throw in all of the routing and firewall capabilities? It all seems wildly excessive for that usecase (however it does seem to be one of the cheapest brand new 25Gbe NICs currently available).</p>
<p>I can’t really see it fitting into large infrastructure deployments other than being used as a cheap 25Gbps NIC in the default passthrough configuration, and seems to be targeted mostly towards small businesses.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if this product will ever actually take off, since it’s been over 3 months since it was announced (or launched?) and is seemingly nowhere to be seen. I can’t find any proper reviews for it, and pretty much all the information on it is just commentary on or directly parroting the official announcement (so I guess I’m first?).<br>
The lifecycle state of it is extremely unclear: Mikrotik’s site just says “send purchase questions”, there are 34 pages total that mention it on their site (a vast majority of which are people asking <em>why</em> in forum threads, the rest are a handful of manuals and product matrixes), and almost all the Mikrotik authorized retailers either say “Pre-Order” or “Out of Stock”. I’m not even sure if I’m supposed to have this thing.</p>
<p>Regardless of the weird lifecycle void this falls into, I believe I’ve found the ideal use case for it: single server co-location.</p>
<p>When you lease co-location space in small enough quantities to lease in terms of “rack units” instead of “racks”, you’re going to be paying extra for every single space you use.
They often provide no solution for firewalls and no customer-configurable routers and just hand you an uplink that’s wide-open to any traffic that could possibly head your way. The typical configuration for custom routing and firewalls is to attach the WAN port to a virtual machine running something like Vyos or pfSense and then creating a LAN vSwitch and attaching it to all of your VMs, which burns extra CPU cycles on all of the traffic processing.</p>
<p>Aside from the weird lifecycle situation this card has, there’s also an inconsistency between what’s listed on their main product page which says that it runs a 1.5GHz Annapurna Labs AL52400 CPU and the manual and spec sheet, which says it uses a 2GHz Annapurna Labs AL32400 CPU.
The two different CPU speeds in addition to the different model numbers leads me to believe they’re different chips but without taking it apart I can’t confirm. I’m unable to find any actual documentation on the AL52400, so it could either be an error or something from an earlier “beta” card. Unfortunately, I’m not able to get any good diagnostic information on what it actually is from the device itself.
Mikrotik’s documentation lists <code>system resource print</code> as also outputting a <code>CPU</code> field that shows what the model is, but this doesn’t output one. I’m inclined to believe that it’s the AL32400 since it’s the same one that appears in its cousin, the CCR2004-1G-12S+2XS.</p>

<p>The CCR2004-1G-2XS-PCIe is a sleek, black, single-slot card with a single blower fan towards the back. It has two SFP28 cages for uplinks, and one RJ-45 connector.
Mikrotik’s specs list it as 170mm x 69mm x 18mm, small enough to fit comfortably in my half-depth HP ProLiant DL20 G9. It does partially block the SATA port that’s under it, so if you want to access the DL20’s SATA port you’ll have to replace the DL20’s original SATA cable with one that has a 90° connector.
It doesn’t require any power sources other than the PCIe slot it’s installed in.</p>

<h2 id="testing-the-card">Testing the Card</h2>
<p>The manual suggests adding a PCIe initialization delay in your BIOS settings because the card needs to be up before the host system tries to initialize it. I couldn’t find any obvious ways to do that on my HP ProLiant DL20 G9 after going through <em>every</em> menu, but in the end it didn’t matter because the card was always up long before the host tried to initialize it.
The brochure (but not the manual? Seriously, the manual has almost nothing. Its biggest section tells you how to use the reset button.) recommends using the following script to reinitialize PCIe devices in Linux systems if the host boots before the card:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>echo "1" &gt; /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:03\:00.0/remove # substitue your actual device ID here
sleep 2
echo "1" &gt; /sys/bus/pci/rescan
</code></pre><p>The card is presented to the host operating system as a Qualcomm Atheros AR8151 (for the full verbose output of <code>lspci</code>, check <a href="https://gist.github.com/alyxw/07b1cb0a87c490e759283206db0b52b9">here</a>), so the system you install it in will need drivers that support it.
I tested Ubuntu 22.04 (but it says anything with kernel 5.15.25 or higher should work), pfSense 2.6.0, and the latest Vyos 1.4 Rolling build that was available at the time (vyos-1.4-rolling-202205210217-amd64.iso).</p>
<p>I attempted to load drivers for it into VMware 7.0 Update 3d, but the community VIB file (net-atl1e-1.0.1.14-1.x86_64.vib) for the Atheros chipset isn’t supported in VMware 6.7+ and newer because VMware deprecated the ability to load legacy drivers. It <em>may</em> run in VMware 5.0-6.5, but I have not tested it and they’re old enough that I’m not sure why you’d want to.</p>
<p>In my testing, I used FS.com’s SFP+ DACs and was able to get a link up at 10Gbps to my NAS running an Intel X520-DA2 and across the SFP+ ports on my Dell Force10 S4810P. (ethtool output for the interfaces the card presented is <a href="https://gist.github.com/alyxw/194b6488351bcdfd116f3a7bc353c9a2">here</a> (ens2f0 has the SFP+ module attached; ens2f2 and ens2f3 are bridged to the management interface))</p>
<p>It works exactly as you’d expect, it’s just a Mikrotik router that siphons power from and can present virtual interfaces to its host, there’s not really any surprises.</p>
<p>I don’t have the gear to build elaborate topologies to push it to its limits and don’t have hardware to test it against that goes any faster than 10Gbps, so my performance testing was extremely limited.</p>
<p>In testing, I used the default MTU of 1500.
Hardware-wise I used:</p>
<ul>
<li>HP ProLiant DL20 G9
<ul>
<li>Intel Xeon E3-1240 v6</li>
<li>32 GB DDR4 ECC (2x16)</li>
<li>Mikrotik CCR2004-1G-2XS-PCIe</li>
<li>Nitrokey HSM 2</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Custom Cube NAS
<ul>
<li>Supermicro X11SCL-F</li>
<li>Intel Celeron G4930 (believe it or not, this actually works fantastically for a NAS)</li>
<li>16GB DDR4 ECC (2x8)</li>
<li>Intel X520-DA2</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dell S4180P</li>
<li>FS.com CBL-10GSFP-DAC-1M Copper DACs</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="bi-directional-iperf3">Bi-directional iPerf3</h4>
<p>I ran a bidirectional iPerf3 test in the default configuration for a duration of 10 minutes, and didn’t observe any performance or speed degradations during that time. During the test the card reported a CPU load of roughly 20% for the entire duration. I’ve attached the first ten seconds below, but you can view the entire test <a href="https://gist.github.com/alyxw/46fc9f7cf66b61c6b506c9f43bdb724c">here</a>.</p>
<p>During the test the RX rate is significantly lower than the TX, which I suspect may be due to a bottleneck from the Celeron-powered NAS.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The CCR2004-1G-2XS-PCIe seems to be a solid card for use in small deployments, especially single-server co-location setups where something like a dedicated router may not be practical.
It’s a fully featured router and is cheaper than many of the 25Gbps capable cards that are available new on the market.
It has no or limited support in VMware, so if your infrastructure uses VMware it’s solidly a no-go.
Drivers should be available in most of the latest releases of most major Linux distros, and it works with the current releases of Vyos, pfSense and OPNsense (if you want to put a router in your router).
For the $200 price point Mikrotik has set for it, it’s hard to pass. The cheapest and most basic dual-port SFP28 25Gbps card currently available on CDW, the Supermicro AOC-S25G-b2S, starts at $313 USD, more than $100 more than Mikrotik’s CCR2004-1G-2XS-PCIe.
It fits my niche perfectly, and in the next few months I’m going to be deploying my CCR2004-1G-2XS-PCIe as well as my HP ProLiant DL20 G9 to a co-location facility as part of another upcoming project.</p>
<p>If you can manage to find a retailer that carries it (seriously, has this been officially released? almost no one has it) and have a use-case that it fits (or just want a really cheap 25Gbps NIC and don’t care about the routing features), it’s definitely worth it.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier today we experienced a DDoS HTTP attack, which was automatically mitigated by OVH, so only caused minimal disruption. However it's concerning that it happened at all, as all the ips were Cloudflare ips, e.g.:</p><p>162.158.202.23 - - [01/Dec/2023:23:30:02 -0500] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 301 244</p><p>162.158.202.23 - - [01/Dec/2023:23:30:02 -0500] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 301 244</p><p>172.69.90.116 - - [01/Dec/2023:23:30:02 -0500] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 301 244</p><p>108.162.221.143 - - [01/Dec/2023:23:30:02 -0500] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 301 244</p><p>162.158.235.85 - - [01/Dec/2023:23:30:02 -0500] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 301 244</p><p>162.158.110.143 - - [01/Dec/2023:23:30:02 -0500] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 301 244</p><p>162.158.110.142 - - [01/Dec/2023:23:30:02 -0500] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 301 244</p><p>162.158.202.23 - - [01/Dec/2023:23:30:02 -0500] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 301 244</p><p>162.158.202.22 - - [01/Dec/2023:23:30:02 -0500] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 301 244</p><p>162.158.202.23 - - [01/Dec/2023:23:30:02 -0500] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 301 244</p><p>(it was around 5800 requests per second to a site that normally gets 1 request per second or less at this time of day, and lasted 21.5 minutes).</p><p>As it is http, I don't think it could have been spoofed. I tried contacting cloudflare, but they are impossible to contact unless you are a customer. All their social media chat just uses bots and it is impossible to connect to a human if you're not a customer. I tried calling their emergency DDoS line, but the person just said that cloudflare doesn't DDoS people (even though I explained that the attack definitely came from their network, and someone was likely using their service to DDoS us). They simply refused to direct me to anyone else in their company. The phone number is just for people looking to purchase DDoS protection, and they don't have any other method of contacting them.</p><p>So, can someone explain why Cloudflare seems to be DDoSing us, and exactly how it happened?</p><p>There is no way to report abuse to Cloudflare unless it is a cloudflare website. (I tried, and it refuses to submit the report). I suspect it may be someone abusing their WARP VPN service, but there doesn't seem to be any way of reporting abuse about it.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What Is It</h2>
<p dir="auto">This project is an easy-to-use client (RP) and server (OP) implementation for the <code>OIDC</code> (OpenID Connect) standard written for <code>Go</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The RP is certified for the <a href="https://www.certification.openid.net/plan-detail.html?public=true&amp;plan=uoprP0OO8Z4Qo" rel="nofollow">basic</a> and <a href="https://www.certification.openid.net/plan-detail.html?public=true&amp;plan=AYSdLbzmWbu9X" rel="nofollow">config</a> profile.</p>
<p dir="auto">Whenever possible we tried to reuse / extend existing packages like <code>OAuth2 for Go</code>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Basic Overview</h2>
<p dir="auto">The most important packages of the library:</p>
<pre>/pkg
    /client            clients using the OP for retrieving, exchanging and verifying tokens       
        /rp            definition and implementation of an OIDC Relying Party (client)
        /rs            definition and implementation of an OAuth Resource Server (API)
    /op                definition and implementation of an OIDC OpenID Provider (server)
    /oidc              definitions shared by clients and server

/example
    /client/api        example of an api / resource server implementation using token introspection
    /client/app        web app / RP demonstrating authorization code flow using various authentication methods (code, PKCE, JWT profile)
    /client/github     example of the extended OAuth2 library, providing an HTTP client with a reuse token source
    /client/service    demonstration of JWT Profile Authorization Grant
    /server            examples of an OpenID Provider implementations (including dynamic) with some very basic login UI
</pre>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How To Use It</h2>
<p dir="auto">Check the <code>/example</code> folder where example code for different scenarios is located.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# start oidc op server

<ul dir="auto">
<li>open <a href="http://localhost:9999/login" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:9999/login</a> in your browser</li>
<li>you will be redirected to op server and the login UI</li>
<li>login with user <code>test-user@localhost</code> and password <code>verysecure</code></li>
<li>the OP will redirect you to the client app, which displays the user info</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">for the dynamic issuer, just start it with:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="go run github.com/zitadel/oidc/v3/example/server/dynamic"><pre>go run github.com/zitadel/oidc/v3/example/server/dynamic</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">the oidc web client above will still work, but if you add <code>oidc.local</code> (pointing to 127.0.0.1) in your hosts file you can also start it with:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="CLIENT_ID=web CLIENT_SECRET=secret ISSUER=http://oidc.local:9998/ SCOPES=&quot;openid profile&quot; PORT=9999 go run github.com/zitadel/oidc/v3/example/client/app"><pre>CLIENT_ID=web CLIENT_SECRET=secret ISSUER=http://oidc.local:9998/ SCOPES=<span><span>"</span>openid profile<span>"</span></span> PORT=9999 go run github.com/zitadel/oidc/v3/example/client/app</pre></div>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why another library</h2>
<p dir="auto">As of 2020 there are not a lot of <code>OIDC</code> library's in <code>Go</code> which can handle server and client implementations. ZITADEL is strongly committed to the general field of IAM (Identity and Access Management) and as such, we need solid frameworks to implement services.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Goals</h3>

<li><a href="https://openid.net/certification/#OPs" rel="nofollow">Certify this library as OP</a></li>

<h4>Impact of Tinnitus on Quality of Life</h4>
<p>“Beyond the nuisance of having persistent ringing or other sounds in the ears, tinnitus symptoms are debilitating in many patients, causing sleep deprivation, social isolation, anxiety and depression, adversely affecting work performance, and reducing significantly their quality of life,” said senior author&nbsp;Stéphane F. Maison, PhD, CCC-A, a principal investigator at Mass Eye and Ear, a member of Mass General Brigham, and clinical director of the Mass Eye and Ear Tinnitus Clinic. “We won’t be able to cure tinnitus until we fully understand the mechanisms underlying its genesis. This work is a first step toward our ultimate goal of silencing tinnitus.”</p>

<h4>Rethinking Tinnitus and Hearing Loss</h4>

<p>Many individuals with hearing loss report a buzzing, humming, ringing, or even roaring sound in their ears. It’s been a longstanding idea that these symptoms, known as tinnitus, arise as a result of a maladaptive plasticity of the brain. In other words, the brain tries to compensate for the loss of hearing by increasing its activity, resulting in the perception of a phantom sound, tinnitus. Until recently though, this idea was disputed as some tinnitus sufferers have normal hearing tests.</p>
<p>However, the discovery of cochlear synaptopathy back in 2009 by Mass Eye and Ear investigators brought back to life this hypothesis as it was evidenced that patients with a normal hearing test can have a significant loss to the auditory nerve. In view of this paradigm shift in the way researchers and clinicians think about hearing loss, Maison and his team sought to determine if such hidden damage could be associated with the tinnitus symptoms experienced by a cohort of normal hearing participants. By measuring the response of their auditory nerve and brainstem, the researchers found that chronic tinnitus was not only associated with a loss of auditory nerve but that participants showed hyperactivity in the brainstem.</p>
<h4>Towards a Potential Cure for Tinnitus</h4>
<p>“Our work reconciles the idea that tinnitus may be triggered by a loss of auditory nerve, including in people with normal hearing,” said Maison.</p>
<p>In terms of future directions, the investigators aim to capitalize on recent work geared toward the regeneration of auditory nerve via the use of drugs called neurotrophins.</p>
<p>“The idea that one day, researchers might be able to bring back the missing sound to the brain and, perhaps, reduce its hyperactivity in conjunction with retraining, definitely brings the hope of a cure closer to reality,” Maison added.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Electrocaloric Material Makes Solid-State Fridge Scalable" data-elid="2666351739" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/solid-state-refrigerator" data-authors="Rahul Rao" data-page-title="Electrocaloric Material Makes Solid-State Fridge Scalable - IEEE Spectrum"><p>Many of today’s refrigerators and air conditioners have a fundamental flaw. Most coolers operate by vapor compression, relying on a fluid to absorb heat and wick it away. Vapor compression tech is cheap and proven, but it’s also inefficient and about as downsizable as a <a data-linked-post="2650273501" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-quest-for-the-ultimate-vacuum-tube" target="_blank">1950s vacuum-tube computer</a>. Plus, its workhorse fluids—in particular, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)—often enter the atmosphere as <a href="https://climate.ec.europa.eu/eu-action/fluorinated-greenhouse-gases/climate-friendly-alternatives-hfcs_en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">potent greenhouse gases</a>.</p><p>Fortunately, there are a few solid-state alternatives to vapor compression that avoid these problems. More than just cleaning up refrigerators’ acts, the alternatives could create <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/a-solid-state-fridge-in-your-pocket" target="_self">cooling devices in miniature</a>, small enough to fit in a pocket. One such alternative relies on solid materials that change temperature under an electric field: what scientists call the electrostatic effect.</p><p>Researchers have now created arguably the most successful demonstration yet of an <a data-linked-post="2650276086" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/a-solid-state-fridge-in-your-pocket" target="_blank">electrocaloric</a> component. Relying on a ceramic multilayer capacitor, this regenerative heat exchanger (a.k.a. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_heat_exchanger" target="_blank">regenerator</a>) features a difference in temperature more than 50 percent greater than any electrocaloric that preceded it.</p><p>“This is really something of interest because the technology we are using is intrinsically scalable.”<br><strong>—Emmanuel Defay, Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology</strong></p><p>When an electric field courses through an electrocaloric material, the material reacts by warming up; when the field vanishes, the material cools back down. The trick is to switch on the electric field, hold it on, force the resulting heat to radiate away, and then switch off the field—encouraging the material to chill to depths lower than its original temperature.</p><p>Researchers have known about the electrocaloric effect for more than half a century, but for most of that time, they could not do much with it. Until well into the 21st century, no one could coerce an electrocaloric material into a temperature difference of more than 10 ºC.</p><p>Then, in the late 2010s, researchers discovered they could boost an electrocaloric material’s potency by fashioning it into a multilayer capacitor. “If we put the right material in there, then we could have access to a larger [change in temperature],” says <a href="https://pace.uni.lu/emmanuel-defay/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Emmanuel Defay</a>, a materials scientist at the <a href="https://www.list.lu/" target="_blank">Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology</a> (LIST). </p><p>Defay and colleagues in Luxembourg and at Japan’s <a href="https://www.murata.com/" target="_blank">Murata Manufacturing</a> set their eyes on one particular ceramic: a <a data-linked-post="2650277908" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/hail-the-perovskite-transistors" target="_blank">perovskite</a>, lead scandium tantalate (PST). They created a regenerator from stacked layers of PST submerged in silicone oil.</p><p>First, the regenerator’s electric field activates, and its PST heats up, as electrocalorical materials do. A syringe pump pushes the silicone oil one way through the stack, which absorbs heat from the PST and creates a hot end on the far side. The electric field deactivates, and the stack cools down; the pump pushes the oil back through the stack to the other, cold end, and the PST absorbs some of its heat. Repeating this process over and over creates a regenerative cycle.</p><p>When their LIST and Murata researchers <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abb8045" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first published</a> their regenerator results in <em>Science </em>in 2020, it exhibited a record 13 °C difference between its hot and cold ends. After several years of tinkering with the regenerator’s design, Defay and his colleagues have increased that delta to another record, 20.9 °C.</p><p>Moreover, they measured a cooling power of 4.2 watts. That figure may be orders of magnitude less than a garden-variety vapor-compression refrigerator, but in the world of electrocalorics, the authors say it’s a 15-fold improvement over any material that came before.</p><p>Defay is optimistic about the future. “This is really something of interest because the technology we are using is intrinsically scalable,” Defay says. “We can scale it because those elements we are using are already commercialized for other purposes.” </p><p>But before a warming world can begin fighting heat waves with electrocaloric coolers, the regenerator’s builders will have to further iterate their design. For one thing, none of the present ceramics’ key elements are appealing for mass production. Lead is toxic; scandium is prohibitively expensive; tantalum is a <a href="https://www.mining-technology.com/features/featureon-the-trail-of-tantalum-4831288/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">conflict material</a> in Central Africa and, Defay says, best avoided.</p><p>Additionally, the silicone oil that the researchers use to absorb heat is actually a relatively bad thermal conductor. Defay would prefer to use water, which could do the job far more effectively. Unfortunately, water—or any electrically conductive fluid like it—will short-circuit the regenerator. So Defay says for the present purposes they were forced to use a poor substitute. However, he adds, if the regenerator could be redesigned to be waterproofed, the problem would be solved. “We could then increase the cooling power by one order of magnitude,” Defay says.</p><p>Electrocalorics are not the only technology that could create solid-state refrigerators. On the reverse of the electromagnetic coin are magnetocaloric materials, which change temperature under a magnetic field. In fact, in 2014, other researchers <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140700713002594" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">built</a> a magnetocaloric refrigerator capable of on the order of a hundred times as much cooling power as even the present record-shattering electrocaloric regenerator.</p><p>Defay and colleagues <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi5477" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published</a> their record regenerator results in <em>Science </em>earlier this month.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Google's war on ad blockers is just gearing up, with YouTube doing its best to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/11/youtube-tries-to-kill-ad-blockers-in-push-for-ad-dollars-premium-subs/">detect and block</a> ad blockers and Chrome aiming to roll out the ad block-limiting <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/google-chrome-will-limit-ad-blockers-starting-june-2024/">Manifest V3 extension platform</a> in June 2024. A new article <a href="https://www.engadget.com/inside-the-arms-race-between-youtube-and-ad-blockers-140031824.html">from Engadget</a> detailing the "arms race" over ad blocking brings up an interesting point regarding the power that YouTube and Chrome have in this battle: a dramatic update advantage over the ad blockers.</p>
<p>In addition to hamstringing Chrome's extension platform with no real user-centric justifications, Manifest V3 will also put roadblocks up before extension <em>updates</em>, which will delay an extension developer's ability to quickly respond to changes. YouTube can instantly switch&nbsp;up its ad delivery system, but once Manifest V3 becomes mandatory, that won't be true for extension developers. If ad blocking is a cat-and-mouse game of updates and counter-updates, then Google will force the mouse to slow down.</p>
<p>Chrome's "Manifest V3" makes dramatic changes to the Chrome extension platform. The current platform, Manifest V2, has been around for over ten years and works just fine, but it's also quite powerful and allows extensions to have full filtering control over the traffic your web browser sees. That's great for protecting privacy, speeding up the web, and blocking ads, but it also means you can download a browser from the world's biggest ad company and use it to block ads—and that was only going to last for so long.</p>
<p>Google's first attack on ad blockers is blowing up the "WebRequest API"—the primary API that ad blockers use—and replacing it with a more limited filtering API that Google has more control over. The new <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/mv3-overview/#network-request-modification">declarativeNetRequest</a> API now has extensions <em>ask</em> Chrome to block a network request on their behalf, features arbitrary limits on the number of filtering rules, and puts limits on <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBOL-home/wiki/Frequently-asked-questions-(FAQ)">how effective</a> individual rules can be.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>We've covered this already. But we haven't talked about the other side of the equation: Ad block rules can't be updated quickly anymore. Today,&nbsp;ad blockers and privacy apps can ship filter list updates themselves, often using giant open-source community lists. Manifest V3 will stop this by limiting what Google describes "remotely hosted code." All updates, even to benign things like a filtering list, will need to happen through full extension updates through the Chrome Web Store. They will all be subject to Chrome Web Store reviews process, and that comes with a significant time delay.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/inside-the-arms-race-between-youtube-and-ad-blockers-140031824.html">Engadget's Anthony&nbsp;Ha</a> interviewed some developers in the filtering extension community, and they described a constant cat-and-mouse game with YouTube. <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/">Ghostery’s</a> director of product and engineering, Krzysztof Modras, said that YouTube is “adapting [its] methods more frequently than ever before. To counteract its changes to ad delivery and ad blocker detection, block lists have to be updated at minimum on a daily basis, and sometimes even more often. While all players in the space are innovating, some ad blockers are simply unable to keep up with these changes.”</p>
<p>uBlock Origin's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/comments/17tm9rp/youtube_antiadblock_and_ads_november_12_2023_mega/">FAQ</a> on YouTube's ad blocker detection says, "YouTube changes their detection scripts regularly" and adds that ad block users might briefly be blocked for "brief periods of time after [YouTube changes] scripts and before we updated our filters."</p>
<p>When Manifest V3 becomes mandatory, those updates that need to arrive "at minimum on a daily basis" will no longer be an option. Limiting remotely hosted code sounds like a totally reasonable limitation until you realize that. like most Manifest V3 changes, it seems carefully crafted to cripple ad blockers more than other extensions. Is a filtering list update, which is essentially just a list of websites, <em>really</em> something that needs to be limited by the "no remotely hosted code" policy?</p>
<p>Firefox is basically being forced to support Manifest V3 extensions due to the popularity of Chrome, but it isn't shutting down Manifest V2 support any time soon. Firefox's Manifest V3 implementation doesn't come with the filtering limitations, and parent company Mozilla <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/extensions-addons/heres-whats-going-on-in-the-world-of-extensions/">promises</a> that users can "rest assured that in spite of these changes to Chrome’s new extensions architecture, Firefox’s implementation of Manifest V3 ensures users can access the most effective privacy tools available like uBlock Origin and other content-blocking and privacy-preserving extensions."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>So since all filter list updates now need to go through the Chrome Web Store, how long does a review take? <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66302856/is-there-a-way-to-send-my-chrome-extension-to-testers-before-it-being-approved">Multiple sources</a> on the web put it at anywhere from <a href="https://getsnapfont.com/posts/avoiding-lengthy-review-times-for-chrome-webstore-submissions">a few hours to three weeks</a>, depending on the whims of Google's review system. Keep in mind these timelines are <em>before</em> Google will dramatically increase the workload of Chrome Web Store reviews by requiring absolutely all changes to go through the review process.
</p><p><em>That's </em>the other key weapon. In the future, YouTube will be able to roll out new ad blocking updates whenever it wants, and the ad blockers' response can be slow-rolled by the Chrome Web Store.&nbsp;Ghostery’s Modras thinks this is the future that is coming, telling Engadget, “Through Manifest V3, Google will close the door for innovation in the ad blocking landscape and introduce another layer of gatekeeping that will slow down how ad blockers can react to new ads and online tracking methods.”</p>
<p>Google <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/mv3-overview/">claims </a>that Manifest V3 will improve browser "privacy, security, and performance," but every comment we can find from groups that aren't giant ad companies disputes this description. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has called Google's Manifest V3 communication "<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/chrome-users-beware-manifest-v3-deceitful-and-threatening">deceitful and threatening</a>," and both the EFF and Mozilla have critiqued most of Google's user-focused justifications for the project. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpDFS-GUytg&amp;t=416s">Both groups</a> agree that Manifest V3 <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/googles-plans-chrome-extensions-wont-really-help-security">won't do much for security</a>, since it doesn't stop what extensions usually <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/07/dataspii-inside-the-debacle-that-dished-private-data-from-apple-tesla-blue-origin-and-4m-people/">get caught doing</a>: spying on a user's browser history. Manifest V3 extensions have access to just as much data as before. Ghostery <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/blog/manifest-v3-the-ghostery-perspective">has a page</a> on Manifest V3 warning that "nothing Manifest V3 introduces in its current state can help protect privacy" and calling the project "ultimately user hostile."</p>
<p>For now, Chrome still works like it always has, but Manifest V3 will start becoming mandatory in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/google-chrome-will-limit-ad-blockers-starting-june-2024/">June 2024</a>.</p>

While this isn’t unexpected, it is a rare occurrence.</span></p><p><span>We have automated systems in place to detect and resolve this. We’re notified in Discord and if the box doesn’t become healthy after failover, we’re paged.</span></p><p><span>By </span><span>20:53 UTC</span><span>, the issue had been resolved, all workloads failed over successfully, and service was subsequently restored.</span></p><a href="https://blog.railway.app/p/gcp-incidents#google-cloud-history"><h2><span>Google Cloud History</span></h2></a><a href="https://blog.railway.app/p/gcp-incidents#networking"><h2><span>Networking</span></h2></a><p><span>In 2022, we experienced continual networking blips from Google’s cloud products.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span>N</span>ew York City is poised to get a lot more trees. Last month, the city council passed a measure calling for <a href="https://forestforall.nyc/nyc-urban-forest-agenda/" data-link-name="in body link">30% canopy cover by 2035</a>, up from its current cover of 22%; a recent tree census found there’s enough room in the city to plant an additional 250,000 new trees. .</p><p>More trees, with all their cooling benefits, is a clear win for the environmental justice movement, as cities around the world seek to adapt to hotter temperatures caused by the climate crisis. But where those trees should go – and which kind of trees to plant – is not so straightforward.</p><p>“It’s about not just planting more trees, but the right tree in the right spot,” said Alexander Kobald, a researcher at Cornell University. “It’s really focusing on what the spot calls for and making sure the people [who live near the trees] feel heard.”</p><p>Kobald led the design of <a href="https://labs.aap.cornell.edu/daslab/projects/treefolio" data-link-name="in body link">Tree Folio NYC</a>, a 3D mapping tool that could help city planners solve this problem. Released in August, Tree Folio NYC uses <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/lidar.html#:~:text=Lidar%2C%20which%20stands%20for%20Light,variable%20distances)%20to%20the%20Earth." data-link-name="in body link">lidar scans</a> to offer a “leaf-level” visualization for each of the city’s <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/research/treesearch/57234" data-link-name="in body link">7m trees</a> . By focusing on individual trees rather than the city’s aggregate tree canopy, Kobald said, researchers can learn more about how trees contribute to the overall shadiness of specific areas and then better direct resources to those areas.</p><figure id="e2d3d8a6-3172-4c08-a5d8-5ee27e752b52" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:4,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/sep/14/tree-planting-us-climate-crisis&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;US launches $1bn tree-planting scheme to mitigate effects of climate crisis&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;e2d3d8a6-3172-4c08-a5d8-5ee27e752b52&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:1,&quot;theme&quot;:0,&quot;design&quot;:10}}" config="{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;,&quot;darkModeAvailable&quot;:false}"></gu-island></figure><p>“Unlike industry-standard tools that tend to look at overall canopy … this research seeks to understand the aggregate impact of trees based on their individual contributions,” said Kobald.</p><p>Expanding the city’s tree canopy has year-round benefits. Exposure to trees <a href="https://www.dec.ny.gov/lands/90720.html#:~:text=Spending%20time%20around%20trees%20and,related%20hormones%20cortisol%20and%20adrenaline." data-link-name="in body link">has been shown</a> to boost immunity, lower stress and blood pressure, enhance mood, sharpen focus and increase energy levels. Children who live in areas with more street trees are less likely to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3415223/" data-link-name="in body link">suffer from asthma</a>.</p><p>But communities of color in the US have, on average, <a href="https://www.treeequityscore.org/" data-link-name="in body link">33% less tree canopy</a> than majority-white areas, according to American Forests’ Tree Equity Score. That lack of trees contributes to the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/heatislands" data-link-name="in body link">urban heat island effect,</a> where buildings, roads and other built infrastructure absorb heat, making those neighborhoods significantly hotter than nearby greener neighborhoods. Low-income neighborhoods and communities of color are more likely to be located in urban heat islands, a legacy of segregation and racist redlining practices.</p><p>As cities experience longer and more severe heatwaves, those disparities can turn deadly. Black New Yorkers are about <a href="https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/key-topics/climatehealth/2022-heat-report/#:~:text=Black%20New%20Yorkers%20are%20more,and%20disadvantage%20people%20of%20color." data-link-name="in body link">twice as likely</a> as white residents to die from heat exposure, according to 2022 city data.</p><p>Historically, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-09/what-mapping-every-tree-in-new-york-city-reveals" data-link-name="in body link">urban trees have been planted in uniform rows</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-09/what-mapping-every-tree-in-new-york-city-reveals" data-link-name="in body link">prioritizing aesthetics and economic development</a> over maximizing their climate benefits. Kobald argues that more strategic placement of trees can enhance their climate impact and ensure they’re more equitably distributed.</p><p>“I think the relationship between tree shade and the local context [illustrates] the need to give streets more design attention,” said Kobald.</p><p>Kobald points to other improvements that, along with tree placement, could create safer streets for all residents: allocating more pedestrian space on sunnier sides of streets where desirable, protecting bike lanes and investing in overall pedestrian comforts.</p><p>“I think what Tree Folio is doing is very helpful when thinking about placement, where to get the most shade, and how to reduce heat,” said Rachel Comte, owner of Urban Canopy Works , a collective of arborists and planners who consult on urban forestry in cities across the US.</p><p>This sort of strategic thinking about how and where to plant trees could prove beneficial in dense urban environments like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">New York</a> City, especially in areas most in need of shade and cooling.</p><p>“The trends are historic and persistent; there is less tree canopy in areas that have more social vulnerability in terms of the communities that live there,” said Mike Treglia, lead scientist for the cities team at The Nature Conservancy in New York .</p><p>In 2021, The Nature Conservancy released a comprehensive report, <a href="https://forestforall.nyc/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/State_of_the_Urban_Forest_NYC.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">The State of the Urban Forest</a>,<em> </em>which found that<em> </em>the South Bronx, a historically low-income area with some of the <a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/research/centers/columbia-center-childrens-environmental-health/our-research/health-effects/asthma#:~:text=The%20areas%20of%20the%20South,visits%2C%20hospitalizations%2C%20and%20deaths." data-link-name="in body link">highest asthma rates</a> in the country, saw notable increases in canopy cover from 2010 to 2017. However, its especially dense city landscape creates limitations as to how much new tree canopy can grow there.</p><p>“A lot of this is driven by the built environment,” said Treglia. He points to streetscapes, parks and open-streets initiatives as answers to how more space can be created for street trees.</p><p>New York City also passed new <a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6229337&amp;GUID=D9415665-C1D2-42C2-93D5-402340A7B90E&amp;Options=&amp;Search=" data-link-name="in body link">urban forestry laws</a> that call for the creation of an urban forest plan, which must be updated every 10 years and monitored every five years using <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/lidar.html#:~:text=Lidar%2C%20which%20stands%20for%20Light,variable%20distances)%20to%20the%20Earth." data-link-name="in body link">lidar</a> data.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-19">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-19" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>But the new laws do not allocate further city funding, and urban forestry has historically struggled to maintain sufficient funding in New York City.</p><p>“Oftentimes funding for trees and tree-related things gets cut first and sort of at a greater pace,” said Emily Maxwell, cities team director at The Nature Conservancy, which advocated for the law.</p><figure id="d6299c9f-e917-4f96-903b-c39e22b6f999" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:22,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/08/us-air-pollution-people-of-color-census-districts&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;US neighborhoods with more people of color suffer worse air pollution&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;d6299c9f-e917-4f96-903b-c39e22b6f999&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:1,&quot;theme&quot;:0,&quot;design&quot;:10}}" config="{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;,&quot;darkModeAvailable&quot;:false}"></gu-island></figure><p>In September, the New York City mayor, Eric Adams, <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/libraries-summer-school-police-and-composting-face-cuts-amid-nyc-budget-crisis" data-link-name="in body link">ordered all city agencies</a> to cut spending by 5% by next spring.</p><p>“With the new cuts, the jury is still out on what the impact is going to be on the urban forest,” said Maxwell. “Advocates are quite worried, particularly about some of the newer funding in place.”</p><p>One of the more ambitious elements of the new plan is its emphasis on maintenance so that trees make it to maturity.</p><p>“Consider the difference between a 3in oak and a 30in oak,” said Comte, of Urban Canopy Works . “That 30in oak provides <a href="https://www.deeproot.com/blog/blog-entries/why-investing-in-mature-tree-growth-is-beneficial-for-cities-a-financial-and-environmental-case/#:~:text=The%20larger%2C%20mature%20tree%20was,city%27s%20financial%20and%20ecological%20health." data-link-name="in body link">70 times more air pollutant interception </a>than the 3in oak,” said Comte. “The mature trees are doing the lion’s share of the work. So we really want trees that will make it to maturity.”</p><p>In urban environments, that involves getting creative. The average lifespan of a street tree, which may be exposed to root-eroding elements like pet urine and road salt, is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1618866711000422" data-link-name="in body link">19-28 years</a>, compared with the <a href="https://www.logmasterstreeservice.com/how-long-do-trees-live/#:~:text=In%20general%2C%20trees%20live%20from,live%20for%20about%2030%20years." data-link-name="in body link">300-400 years</a> that is typical for a tree in other conditions. To increase trees’ chances of reaching maturity, city planners must plant a diverse array of them to ward off disease, favor climate-adaptive species, maintain healthy soil conditions, and allocate enough space – above and below ground – for the trees to grow.

        <p>Just because you’re a monk doesn’t mean you can’t use CAD. The Carmelite monks of Wyoming are building a grandiose <a href="https://carmelitegothic.com/" target="_blank">Gothic Monastery</a>, and it’s awe inspiring how they are managing to build it.</p>
<p><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video id="video-570639-1" width="800" height="450" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Carmelite-Gothic-Church1.mp4?_=1"><a href="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Carmelite-Gothic-Church1.mp4">https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Carmelite-Gothic-Church1.mp4</a></video></p>
<p>The Carmelite monks needed a new, larger monastery to house their growing numbers, and found a parcel of land near <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@44.2658692,-109.1431654,654m/data=!3m1!1e3" target="_blank">Meeteetse Creek in Wyoming</a>. The design of their new Gothic monastery was outsourced to an architectural firm. Gothic architecture is characterised by key architectural elements such as pointed arches, large stained glass windows, rib vaults, flying buttresses, pinnacles and spires, elaborate entry portals, and ornate decoration.</p>
<p>After some research, the monks settled on using Kansas Silverdale limestone for the monastery. Cutting and carving the elaborate stone pieces required for such a project, within time and cost constraints, could only be achieved using CNC machines. Hand carving was ruled out as it was a very slow process, would cost a whole lot more, and it wouldn’t be easy to find the artisans for the job. So when it came to shortlisting vendors for the vast amount of stone cutting and carving required for construction, the monks found themselves alarmed at how prohibitively expensive it would turn out to be.</p>



<p>Since stone carving and installation were the most expensive items for the overall project, the monks decided to tackle that job themselves. This meant learning the whole <a href="https://carmelitegothic.com/cnc-stone-carving/" target="_blank">CNC stone-carving workflow</a>, all about stone cutting machinery, operating CNC machines, CAD modelling, CAM programming, stone masonry and construction techniques. Planning for the project started in 2010. In 2013, they purchased their first CNC machine from <a href="https://prussiani.com/en/brother-gabriel-marie-monks-of-the-most-blessed-virgin-mary-of-mount-carmel-meeteetse-usa/" target="_blank">Prussiani Engineering</a> S.p.A., who specialise in stone cutting machines, integrated with stone cutting CAD/CAM software from <a href="https://www.pegasuscadcam.com/en/tecnologia/cad-cam-stone/" target="_blank">Pegasus CAD-CAM</a>. Prussiani also provided support to the monks as they embarked on their CNC journey. After spending time learning all the skills and some trial-and-error later, actual construction on the project started in 2014 and continues till date.&nbsp;Their early days were not without a few disasters. In their own words –</p>
<blockquote><p>“A&nbsp;few months after we started carving stone, we left our first CNC machine running overnight on several 7 foot long window sills. We woke to a shocking surprise the following morning. The huge stones, weighing several hundred pounds each, had been thrown about as if a tornado had ripped through the machine. Stones were snapped and shattered, the fragments scattered about the inside of the CNC milling area. After the shock settled, we proceeded to analyse what had happened. It turns out there was a mistake in the particular batch of code the machine had read and followed that night. At the very end of each window sill, after it had completely finished carving, the code told the CNC machine to repeatedly pound down into the top of the sill, almost as if it was a giant fist. The stones didn’t stand a chance, but that same machine is still carving stones to this day, almost a decade later.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Their website has a crash-course like coverage of <a href="https://carmelitegothic.com/why-gothic-architecture/" target="_blank">Gothic architecture</a>, and <a href="https://carmelitegothic.com/ancient-carmelite-architecture/" target="_blank">details on the various sub-structures</a> that comprise the monastery. It is still work in progress, and many years to go before they finish it. So far, they have managed to complete the Chapter House, see video embedded, and they keep posting updates on their <a href="https://carmelitegothic.com/category/chapter-house/" target="_blank">website</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrNNDOktOTu_cqZyBETOTjHCgmhYL9Lsx" target="_blank">YouTube</a> channel.</p>

Support for NVIDIA graphics processors has traditionally been a sore point
for Linux users; NVIDIA has not felt the need to cooperate with the kernel
community or make free drivers available, and the reverse-engineered
Nouveau driver has often struggled to keep up with product releases.  There
have, however, been signs of improvement in recent years.  At the <a href="https://lpc.events/event/17/page/198-lpc-2023-overview">2023 Linux
Plumbers Conference</a>, graphics subsystem maintainer Dave Airlie provided
an update on the state of support for NVIDIA GPUs and what remains to be
done. 
</p><p>
The kernel community's relationship with NVIDIA "has gone up and down" over
the years, Airlie began.  Recently, though, the company has rearchitected
its products, adding a large RISC-V processor (the GPU system processor, or
GSP) and moving much of the functionality once handled by drivers into the
GSP firmware.  The company allows that firmware to be used by Linux and shipped
by distributors.  This arrangement brings a number of advantages; for
example, it is now possible for the kernel to do reclocking of NVIDIA GPUs,
running them at full speed just like the proprietary drivers can.
It is, he said, a big improvement over the Nouveau-only firmware that was
provided previously.
</p><p>

<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/953147/"><img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/conf/2023/lpc/DaveAirlie-sm.png" alt="[Dave Airlie]" title="Dave Airlie"></a>

There are a number of disadvantages too, though.  The firmware provides no
stable ABI, and a lot of the calls it provides are not documented.  The
firmware files themselves are large, in the range of 20-30MB, and two of
them are required for any given device.  That significantly bloats a
system's <tt>/boot</tt> directory and initramfs image (which must provide
every version of the firmware that the kernel might need), and forces the
Nouveau developers to be strict and careful about picking up firmware
updates.
</p><p>
Nouveau work has taken a bit of a setback since longtime developer Ben
Skeggs left the project, but he did manage to do a lot of refactoring
before he went.  Nouveau now has initial GSP support for one firmware
version; that code was merged in for the 6.7-rc1 release.  It is only
enabled for the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/ada-lovelace-architecture/">Ada</a>
series of GPUs by default; with a command-line argument it can be made to
work with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/turing/">Turing</a>
and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/ampere-architecture/">Ampere</a>
devices as well.  It is missing some features, including fault handling
(which "shouldn't be too hard" to add) and sensor monitoring, which doesn't
work at all.
</p><p>
NVIDIA's firmware, Airlie said, comes with a set of include files that, in
turn, define structures that change over time.  To deal with these changes,
the driver is going to need some sort of automated ABI generation; he noted
that the developers working on the Apple M1 GPU driver have run into the
same problem.  This problem could be made easier to tackle, he suggested,
if the driver were, like the M1 driver, to be rewritten in Rust.
</p><h4>Next steps</h4>
<p>
Supporting the GSP firmware is just the beginning, though; at this point,
Airlie took a step back and talked about the task of making a useful GPU
driver in general.  Years ago, a graphics card came with some video RAM
and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_address_remapping_table">graphics
translation table (GTT)</a>.  The driver would map system memory into the
graphics card; user space could then submit buffer handles that would be
relocated for the graphics device.  This approach works, he said, but it is
slow.
</p><p>
Current GPUs have full virtual memory, instead, which saves a lot of that
overhead.  The kernel has grown a number of subsystems for working with
this virtual memory, including the <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/gpu/drm-mm.html#the-graphics-execution-manager-gem">graphics
execution manager (GEM)</a> for buffer-object management, the <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/gpu/drm-mm.html#the-translation-table-manager-ttm">translation
table manager (TTM)</a> for discrete video-RAM buffer-object management, 
and a bunch of synchronization and fencing code.  Initially, the DRM
subsystem would tie the allocation of a buffer to an allocation of virtual
memory at the same time; that was easy to do and sufficed to implement
OpenGL.  But, he said, the graphics world moved on from there.
</p><p>
Specifically, <a href="https://www.vulkan.org/">Vulkan</a> came along.  It
brought the concept of sparse memory and, with it, virtual memory that is
managed by user space.  Vulkan can handle both synchronous and asynchronous
virtual-area updates, but it "gets complicated".  Various drivers started
inventing their own virtual-area management; as a way of bringing that work
back together, the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/gpu/drm-vm-bind-async.html">VM_BIND</a>
API was developed.
</p><p>
This is consistent with a recurring pattern, Airlie said.  The DRM
developers work to share common code between graphics drivers, but the
driver developers keep trying to reinvent wheels, a tendency that has to be
resisted.  The subsystem did well with regard to mode setting, he said, but
less well on the acceleration side; there is a "common GPU scheduler" that
is only used by one driver, for example.  Similarly, there are a lot of
drivers implementing VM_BIND by doing their own virtual-area management.
</p><p>
In response, Airlie came up with the "good idea" of getting somebody else
to write a common virtual-area manager, called GPUVM, inspired by the
amdgpu code.  It is intended to be useful for all drivers; it is used by
the Nouveau, Xe (Intel's new driver), and Panfrost drivers now.  Hopefully
the amdgpu and MSM drivers will pick it up as well.  The best part is that
there are multiple developers who understand it and can help to keep it
from going off in the wrong direction.  GPUVM has been through a lot of
iterations, he said, providing "lots of learning experiences".
</p><p>
As an example, he talked about the problem of fence signaling.  A fence
indicates when a series of GPU operations has been completed; waits for
these fences have to be time-bounded, or the memory-management subsystem
might deadlock.  In short, a GPU can easily pin down all of a system's RAM
if given the opportunity.  There is a shrinker that can be called when
memory gets tight, but it will have to wait for fences to be signaled to
know when memory can be freed.  If the code that set the fence decides to
allocate more memory while this is happening, a deadlock results.

To avoid this outcome, developers have to strictly limit the operations
that can be performed in fence-signaling critical sections; care must also
be taken before acquiring any locks.  It would be nice to be able to update
the page tables during this code, but that ran into deadlock problems and
had to be backed out.
</p><p>
Returning to Nouveau, Airlie said that the initial VM_BIND API, using
GPUVM, synchronous objects, and integration with the scheduler, was merged
for the 6.6 release.  There are a lot of improvements in the works that
should land in 6.8.  At this point, he said, we have the core of a modern
GPU driver for NVIDIA hardware — for graphics, at least.  More work will be
required before Nouveau can support compute applications.
</p><p>
On the user-space side, Faith Ekstrand has been developing the NVK Vulkan
driver for Nouveau; this driver recently <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/nvk-reaches-vulkan-conformance.html">reached
Vulkan&nbsp;1.0 conformance</a>.  This work involved creating a new
compiler, called NAK, that has just been merged into Mesa; this compiler
yields far better performance (from 20 frames per second to over 1000) than
the old "codegen" compiler did.  Naturally, this compiler is written in
Rust.  The next step, Airlie concluded, is to move forward to
Vulkan&nbsp;1.3.

<p>Oh noo so 7B will use 7.8GB of VRAM on OASST - the weights take 4.8GB or so, whilst LoRA and gradients take 3GB. Other datasets are closer to the 50% reduction in training memory usage.</p>

<p>Apologies on if it seems like I was promoting a paid product - technically we don't even have a price as we're very new to this - the issue was in the past I also released some faster training methods, but it was eaten up by big corpos, but we wanted to provide the most to the OSS community - hence the gating of some aspects of code.</p>

<p>We're still figuring out our pricing plans.</p>

<p>Is there a "guide for complete morons" that will allow a n00b like me to fine tune with your finetuning? I have a 4090 gaming rig. Also, do I need to provide the system with a ton of source material? (e.g. scraped websites) or can I just provide it with a list of instructions that I want it to follow every time it writes something for me (e.g. "don't use passive voice,"write at a college level" etc)?</p>

<p>I'm a writer and I use AI to help me write. thank you</p>

              </figcaption></figure><section><p>In the blistering heat, CBS News found children in Ghana as young as 5 years old using machetes nearly as big as themselves to harvest the cocoa beans that end up in some of America's most-loved chocolates. Our team traveled across Ghana's remote cocoa belt to visit small subsistence farms that supply the U.S. chocolate giant Mars, which produces candies including M&amp;Ms and Snickers.&nbsp;</p><p>We found children working at each one of the farms — despite the company's vow to have systems in place to eradicate child labor in its supply chain by 2025.</p><p>Mars has also boasted about rescuing thousands of children, who are listed as beneficiaries of what it calls a robust monitoring system meant to keep children off cocoa plantations and in schools.&nbsp;</p>    
  <p>CBS News exclusively obtained copies of these lists from a whistleblower and was able to confirm that some of the listed children were still working in the fields.</p><p>Munira, 15, is one of those children. She has worked in the cocoa fields since she was 5 years old. Education is a luxury, with her school an hour-long walk away and transportation options expensive. Last year, her family harvested only one bag of decent-quality cocoa. A 140-pound bag of the product fetches only about $115.&nbsp;</p><figure><span><img src="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/children-harvesting-cocoa-used-by-major-corporations-ghana/cocoa-kids-en.jpg" alt="cocoa-kids-en.jpg " height="349" width="620" data-srcset="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/11/29/24947eae-9cf2-4ef9-83b0-b3978782b7b6/thumbnail/620x349/9834680015dbf4ceb42ce48694962527/cocoa-kids-en.jpg?v=2a3c5d91939c9bf28fa0bc6fdfacfdd4 1x, https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/11/29/24947eae-9cf2-4ef9-83b0-b3978782b7b6/thumbnail/1240x698/f88b0213fcf9ceb2ecf483a5d0cd37f2/cocoa-kids-en.jpg?v=2a3c5d91939c9bf28fa0bc6fdfacfdd4 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20349'%2F%3E"></span>

              </figcaption></figure><p>Last year, field supervisors contracted by Mars visited Munira. They gave her a backpack and schoolbooks with the slogan "I am a child, I play, I go to school." But in the 18 months since that first visit, the family told CBS News no one had checked to see if Munira was, in fact, in school.&nbsp;</p>

    

<p>"I feel sad. I want to be, like, a medical doctor," Munira said. "But my family doesn't have money for school."&nbsp;</p><p>Her 12-year-old brother Gafalo also works in the fields, but longs to join his peers in the classroom.&nbsp;</p><p>A cocoa field supervisor who spoke to CBS News on the condition of anonymity said "almost every data" used to make up the lists "is cooked... or is not accurate," adding that he had personally "made up lists before."&nbsp;</p><p>He and other supervisors told CBS News they were under pressure to produce names, often with only 24 hours' notice, and he said the companies never verify the information.&nbsp;</p>

    
    

<p>"Nobody has come back to check as to whether it's true or not," he said.&nbsp;</p><p>CBS News spoke with nearly a dozen children whose names were on those lists. None of them were in school, and none of them had been regularly monitored to ensure they were attending classes.&nbsp;</p><figure><span><img src="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/children-harvesting-cocoa-used-by-major-corporations-ghana/0.jpg" alt="0.jpg " height="349" width="620" data-srcset="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/11/29/2c725cab-da91-49a6-8273-57d39795fae9/thumbnail/620x349/79b634155b878bdb09bc7b3c51c04df1/0.jpg?v=2a3c5d91939c9bf28fa0bc6fdfacfdd4 1x, https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/11/29/2c725cab-da91-49a6-8273-57d39795fae9/thumbnail/1240x698/16a73fa9aeaac927ac47dba2010c99d0/0.jpg?v=2a3c5d91939c9bf28fa0bc6fdfacfdd4 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20349'%2F%3E"></span>

                          </span>
              </figcaption></figure><p>"No one came here, ever," one child told us.</p><p>In some cases, names on the lists were outright fabrications. CBS News visited a farm where according to a list there was a child who was no longer working in the cocoa fields. The list identified her as the daughter of the farmer, but she doesn't exist.</p><p>Only a third of the 300 students registered at one school visited by CBS News actually attend classes. All students said that they harvested cocoa either before or after school.&nbsp;</p><p>CBS News also visited a cocoa warehouse in Ghana that supplies Mars. An employee at the warehouse, who is not being named by CBS News, said child labor was "an offense" in the country, but he could not guarantee all the cocoa handled at the facility was produced without it.&nbsp;</p><p>"I can't say 100%," he told us.</p>

    
    

<p>Terry Collingsworth, a human rights lawyer in the U.S., has filed a proposed class-action lawsuit alleging consumer fraud against American chocolate companies including Mars. He has collected statements from Ghanaian children working for Mars suppliers, including young boys doing the backbreaking work in the fields.&nbsp;</p><p>CBS News witnessed one child nearly lose his fingers to a machete blade while hacking open cocoa pods.&nbsp;</p><p>"They're telling the public that we're rehabilitating this kid, and then they're cynically coming here and just checking a box and the kid is back working the next day," Collingsworth told CBS News.&nbsp;</p><p>In a statement provided to CBS News, a spokesperson for Mars said:</p><blockquote><p>"W<em>e condemn the use of child labor. Despite our requests, CBS did not provide specific details of their investigation to Mars ahead of time in order for us to investigate claims of misconduct at the time of this report. We treat any claim of misconduct in our supply chain very seriously and we will thoroughly investigate once we have the necessary information and take appropriate action.</em></p><p><em>Our cocoa suppliers in Ghana have agreed to adhere to our robust Supplier Code of Conduct and we have also been clear that they must have a Child Labor and Remediation System (CLMRS) in place by 2025 that complies with the industry leading International Cocoa Initiative (ICI) standard. Over 65% of our cocoa supply in West Africa is already covered by CLMRS which is implemented by our suppliers on the ground, with audits conducted by certification bodies as part of Rainforest Alliance and Fairtrade certification requirements. </em></p><p><em>To be clear, we condemn the use of child labor. It has no place in our supply chain, and we are committed to helping eradicate it, which is why we have a robust Protecting Children Action Plan in place that is backed by a significant financial investment. We are also transparent in saying that we know that more needs to be done and we continue to work diligently with parties across the cocoa sector to further help advance respect for human rights in the cocoa supply chain."</em></p></blockquote>

    <p>The words “Salad Fingers” may not mean anything to some readers, but for others they will trigger nostalgia, some very discomforting memories - or perhaps a “weird” combination of both. </p>

<p>Salad Fingers and his perturbing love of rusty spoons is an uncanny animated pioneer of viral YouTube videos. This creepy character came into being just before the arrival of YouTube, but went on to become the embodiment of “<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/im-in-that-weird-part-of-youtube">the weird part of YouTube</a>”. </p>

<p>The character’s influence is enduring - almost two decades after Salad Fingers first saw the light, the eponymous animated web series is still ongoing. The latest episode, <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/899778">Harvest</a>, was released in September 2023. </p>

<p>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/13548565231208569">the first academic paper</a> to be published on the series, we argue Salad Fingers was a key influence on “weird YouTube’s” countercultural melange of content that escapes the aesthetic, regulatory and moral constraints of mainstream film and television. </p>

<h2>Salad Fingers and the dawn of ‘weird YouTube’</h2>

<p>The year was 2004, and the launch of YouTube was still a year away. On <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/">Newgrounds</a>, a still-active platform dedicated to user-generated content, a young British artist by the name of David Firth released a web series titled Salad Fingers. The series featured a character with an eerie but gentle and soothing voice who inhabits a mysteriously apocalyptic, desolate landscape. </p>

<p>The first episode, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3iOROuTuMA">Spoons</a>, shows the protagonist caressing a rusty spoon and reaching a state of sensual extasis. Like most episodes that would follow, it’s punctuated by repetitive, looping music courtesy of experimental electronic duo Boards of Canada that - like the character’s voice - is as calming as it is unsettling. </p>

<p>Salad Fingers is a green anthropomorphic figure coded as male and with lettuce leaves as hands. His blank, simple features are rendered using rough-hewn animation that looks like a child’s drawing. This rudimentary animation was done in Flash, a software that enabled amateur artists to experiment with narrative and visual style. Flash also simplifies content distribution: the software creates vector images, which weigh less and use less bandwidth.</p>

<p>Over the years, the series has come to enjoy a cult following and Firth released 13 new episodes between 2005 and 2023. </p>

            <figcaption><span>Salad Fingers episode ten: Birthday.</span></figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>While it looks and feels like a children’s show, Salad Fingers does not conform to the norms of children’s television. The series expanded the boundaries of what 21st-century animation can do as an expressive medium. </p>

<p>Today, it’s common to see animations with a subversive, experimental edge destined for adult consumption and dealing with existential crisis (think of Netflix’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1eJMig5Ik4">Bojack Horseman</a>). </p>

<p>But when Salad Fingers was released, it pushed generic boundaries in shocking ways that harnessed the internet’s freedom from content regulation like ratings systems (such as Australia’s G and PG ratings designating child appropriateness).</p>

            <figcaption><span>Netflix’s BoJack Horseman.</span></figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>These ambiguous intentions are the combined appeal and horror of the show: the most common Google search phrases around the series are “Is Salad Fingers supposed to be scary?”, “Is Salad Fingers a children’s show?” and “Why is Salad Fingers weird?”</p>

<p>Firth’s series transgressed the norms of animation styles alongside other artists of the period who used web animation in an experimental way (among them, <a href="https://homestarrunner.com/">Homestar Runner</a> by The Brothers Chaps, <a href="https://illwillpress.com/vault.html">Neurotically Yours</a> by Jonathan Ian Mathers, and the 2003 viral video <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/01/end-of-the-world-viral-video-sequel-by-jason-windsor.html">The End of the World</a> by Jason Windsor).</p>

          </figure>

<h2>Salad Fingers is beyond classification</h2>

<p>While Salad Fingers is culturally aligned with boundary-pushing animated TV series popular at the time, such as The Simpsons and South Park, it’s also distinct due to its avant-garde ambiguity. </p>

<p>Firth <a href="https://narcmagazine.com/interview-david-firth/">talks about the influence</a> of beloved kids’ cartoon Rugrats on his series and character, and indeed Salad Fingers behaves in a very childlike, imaginative manner. However, he also commits unhinged acts of violence with no apparent moral compass. He speaks to his finger puppet imaginary friends, but also to corpses, and cooks a child alive in the oven. </p>

<p>When a Canadian primary school teacher was suspended for screening Salad Fingers to his class, Firth <a href="https://twitter.com/DAVID_FIRTH/status/1157025361399635972">tweeted</a> “I fully support Salad Fingers being shown to children. In fact it should be mandatory”.</p>



<p>This subversive play with the boundaries of good taste and child/adult content is at the heart of Salad Fingers, and of YouTube’s “weird part”. </p>

<p>Yet Salad Fingers also highlights how this weird YouTube mode continues avant-garde and surrealist art, film and television traditions. </p>

<p>The barren landscapes in which the character exists have links to the dark portraits of painter Francis Bacon, to the filmography of auteur David Lynch, and to the grim animated characters of cult art-rock opera Pink Floyd: The Wall. The show’s apocalyptic ethos was also indicative of post-Y2K pessimism and rebellion against aesthetic, cultural and political norms.</p>

<p>The series aligns such traditions with the gleefully disruptive generic ambiguity of early 2000s online video sharing cultures - an ambiguity made possible by the web’s freedom from the constraints of the formal production and distribution structures of film and television. </p>

<p>The series would go on to influence a vibrant and globally beloved genre of “weird” YouTube content committed to derailing cultural expectations about the distinctions between children’s and adult content. </p>

<p>A beloved example is Michelle Lyons’ animated web series [Funny Horsie], which emerged in 2011: this dark and absurd series about an ungainly horse, is ironically <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/FunnyHorsie">described as</a> “one of Britain’s most well-loved, yet obscure children’s programmes”</p>

            <figcaption><span>Funny Horsie.</span></figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>Another progeny of Salad Fingers is cult YouTube puppet-animated hit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZOnoLKzoBItcEk5OsES2TA">Don’t Hug Me I’m Scared</a> (Joseph Pelling and Rebecca Sloan, 2011-16). This nightmarish parody of puppet-based kids’ shows such as Sesame Street became a BBC Channel 4 television series in 2022, highlighting how the influence of weird YouTube is crossing into mainstream media.</p>

            <figcaption><span>Don’t hug me I’m scared.</span></figcaption>
          </figure>

<p>Today, “weird” content on YouTube remains indebted to Salad Fingers and other early internet viral animations such as Funny Horsie. </p>

<p>Just this year, a series titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-ZXraMeHBPJHXBhrNowJaQslyqtUg-tZ">Skibidi Toilet</a> became a viral sensation. The videos show, in rudimentary 3D animation, a series of moving toilets with heads sticking out of them. The singing, fighting toilets have become a sensation, with <a href="https://www.insider.com/skibidi-toilet-is-good-actually-2023-10">Business Insider</a> claiming the series “captures the anarchic spirit of the internet”. </p>

<p>Salad Fingers embodies the anarchic weird YouTube spirit that lives on through these singing toilet heads.</p>

Hi all, I'm Jeremy. I've been a software developer for the past 15 years. I have experience in various sizes and scales of web projects, from greenfield projects up to larger scale sites. I can do both back-end and front-end development, minus design. I'm a quick learner with new frameworks and technologies. I'm looking for a remote position, either long-term contract, a project, or a full-time position. I've also managed dev teams, have done architecture, have served on an executive team at a smaller agency, and am able to take more of a lead or management role. Thanks!</span></p></div></td></tr>

  I am a Computer Science major at Bowdoin College and have been programming for six years. I am currently looking for internships (can be unpaid) in fast-paced and collaborative environments like startups and non-profits. I can work on-site between May and August (summer break or any breaks); however, I can consider working remotely part-time. I am initiative-taking and can work under pressure. I have undertaken large group projects like creating full-stack applications with Django and Next.js, API usage like Discord.py, many Google APIs, and the use of AI through ChatGPT. My projects have been for software development competitions and general community benefits. For example, I won 1st and 3rd in separate years for the FBLA competition in NJ, automated meeting scheduling at AiGoLearning, an education non-profit, deployed a live bracket website for school sports tournaments, and created a `gamified` forum in Discord for my Coding Club. I have always been in small yet rigorous academic environments, taking courses like Advanced Software Development (Java), Web Design (HTML, CSS), Database Programming and development (SQL), and Data Structures (Java).</code></pre></span></p></div></td></tr>

As a former Contracting Officer in the Air Force, I utilize my experience on both sides of the negotiating table to help IT companies Find-Write-Win both Federal and State level contracts.<p>I have helped numerous companies with contract capture, bid writing, federal competitive analytics, and pricing agreements with over $108M in career wins.</p><p>the most common challenges I’ve seen are a lack of:</p><p>- Streamlined procedures around Contract Capture,
- Outreach to Contracting Officers,
- Access to the best deals (oftentimes requiring Pricing Agreements).</p><p>After working nearly 10 years in the industry I have developed a holistic offering to government contracting. Including automations and LLM’s across scraping RFX’s, filtering for scope, and developing a base proposal. These workflows and automations will allow me to submit multiple projects a week with complete autonomy after initial integrations.</p><p>Next Steps: 
Let’s set up a call, where I can share my screen and show you the tools I’ve developed to expand your marketing funnel and win more public contracts.

Hello!  I'm Ricardo, a Full-stack Engineer with 10y of professional experience and a strong emphasis on backend development . Beyond my technical prowess in Javascript/Typescript, PHP 8, Flutter, SQL, Docker, and more, I complement my web development skills with an MBA  and prior experience in administration and financial analysis.<p>For over a decade, I've dedicated myself to the same company, managing the complete life cycle of numerous projects from inception  to deployment , consistently ensuring optimal performance and user experience . Working solo has given me a broad perspective, but I'm now keen to join a team where I can focus on a specific role. Collaborating with and learning from others will undoubtedly fast-track my professional growth .</p><p>Lately, I've been learning about Svelte , Astro , NestJS , and Rust . I'd really like to use them in real work. I look forward to leveraging both my technical and analytical skills in new, challenging projects .</p><p>I'm not inclined to engage in industries that harm the environment , jeopardize people's health , or are ethically dubious. I am committed to making positive contributions to the world through my work .

I am an undergraduate Electrical/Computer Engineering student at the University of Toronto graduating in May 2024, currently searching for new grad opportunities. I just wrapped up a 16 month Co-op doing verification for high speed interfaces (100G Ethernet/PCIE Gen6) last year, and am currently doing a thesis project in systems software on log compression using static analysis.<p>I'm interested in a wide variety of technical work spanning the range from lab tasks characterizing hardware, hardware development or verification, firmware development, systems software, backend software development, and infrastructure work. I'm hoping to work in industries surrounding climate/energy or other industries where my work would make a positive impact. Shoot me an email if it sounds like I would be a good fit.

I identified and reduced inefficiencies in our scrum sprint cycle rituals, and established a standard architecture, code style guide, and best practices document for the client's codebase, resulting in a 28% increase in velocity and allowing us to deliver on schedule for an in-person launch event with 150+ dealerships.</p><p>Unfortunately, my current role has been transforming more and more into a business/digital consultant, which means a lot of my time is spent working on slide decks and high-level architectures that never see the light of day.

Thanks for reading. I'm looking to be a founding engineer in a mission driven start up. I'm interested in building all the things from the ground up. I've done this before in a few places.  So if you are looking to get your whole stack up off the ground including: Basic App, Monitoring, CI/CD, Infrastructure, etc. I'm your guy. Looking for smallish orgs with biggish goals with no more than 10 people. Willing to travel a few times a quarter if necessary for F2F. 
Thanks!</span></p></div></td></tr>

I work at and have worked at Startups and companies. I am Open Source Enthusiast and have contributed to many Open Source programs which piqued my interest and have also written few popular programs. I am multidimensional and have dealt with many domains. I have worked on Backends in Go/Rust/Python, REST APIs, GRPC and Protobuf(also have worked with capnproto and others), Postgresql, MongoDB, Elasticsearch(not an expert in this), Javascript, JS Frameworks like React,Preact,Svelte (have also developed extensions for Chrome/Firefox). I am avid problem solver and like to solve the problems. Once to cure the boredom, I wrote a protocol based on Quic and bincode in Rust(not as efficient as h3 but am happy). I also have good grasp and worked with BitTorrent. In my early days, I used to manage a server for myself and a friend in old fashioned manner and used to maintain many nginx sites, and have good grasp of Linux as well. Wrote an Android app once using java and kotlin without having any knowledge in it before. I also have dabbled in unknown territories and gained good XP points. I also have written many bash scripts. I also have good experience about media codecs and ffmpeg as well. I also know GUI programming using iced(touched Qt ages back and didn't like it). I also care about optimisation (not premature) and have optimised the codebase of backend and frontend at my work. Resume is available on request to email. I also have good contributions in Github(Available on request) and have written good amount of useful Open source softwares too.</span></p></div></td></tr>
