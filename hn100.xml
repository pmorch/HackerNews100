            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/rfinnie/blockbuster">https://github.com/rfinnie/blockbuster</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41276605">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Blockbuster Video VHS insert template</h2><a id="user-content-blockbuster-video-vhs-insert-template" aria-label="Permalink: Blockbuster Video VHS insert template" href="#blockbuster-video-vhs-insert-template"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/rfinnie/blockbuster/blob/main/blockbuster-vhs.png"><img src="https://github.com/rfinnie/blockbuster/raw/main/blockbuster-vhs.png" alt="Blockbuster Video VHS insert template" title="Blockbuster Video VHS insert template"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This is an editable Inkscape template for a Blockbuster Video VHS clamshell case insert.  Please note that this doesn't strive to be 100% accurate to any specific Blockbuster design, as they made incremental design changes to their clamshells over the years.  Instead, it's meant to be a good enough period piece of late 80s through 90s.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Notes</h2><a id="user-content-notes" aria-label="Permalink: Notes" href="#notes"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The fields you'd want to change are all in Liberation Sans and Liberation Sans Narrow fonts, but if you don't have them, similar sans-serif fonts should work fine.</p>
<p dir="auto">The back blurb area is Nimbus Mono PS font, but again, any typewriter-like monospace font should be fine. I've also seen "The BLOCKBUSTER difference" blurb in a sans-serif font.  Later on in the 90s, this space tended to be used for actual movie information, in a sans-serif font.</p>
<p dir="auto">The "BLOCKBUSTER VIDEO" logo font is ITC Machine Std and the barcode is Libre Barcode 128. I've broken these out to separate layers which have alternate layers which are "pre-rendered", so you do not need the fonts.</p>
<p dir="auto">An additional set of layers are available for the simpler "BLOCKBUSTER" logo used later.</p>
<p dir="auto">The barcode format changed several times over the years, but the format depicted here is:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>33: Rental. There were likely other codes for things like services, goods, etc.</li>
<li>55740: The 5-digit store number.</li>
<li>809656: A title-specific internal Blockbuster ID.</li>
<li>003: The per-title sequence for the store. For example, if the store had 10 copies of a title, they would be 001 through 010.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">I don't know what "Rent Code" is, but I've seen "B", "N" and "T".</p>
<p dir="auto">"FOX 2000306" is the studio-specific catalog number for a title (in this case, for Fight Club).</p>
<p dir="auto">The title area may just have the title, but it could also have extra information listed. A common alternative format would be "FIGHT CLUB-1999-BRAD PITT".  Sometimes it would also show "NEW RELEASE-FIGHT CLUB".</p>
<p dir="auto">The most minor variation, but I've seen the rating ("R" in this example) sometimes be bolded, sometimes not.</p>
<p dir="auto">For a list of addresses and store numbers as of Blockbuster's bankruptcy, see <a href="https://www.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/BlockbusterCh11.pdf" rel="nofollow">this bankruptcy filing from 2010</a>. Finding the phone number from the store will take some additional searching.</p>
<p dir="auto">A hidden layer outlines where the spine is in relation to the elements, for alignment purposes. Notice that the spine's barcode actually wraps around to the back a little, by design.</p>
<p dir="auto">For an authentic Blockbuster case experience, take the "Barcodes" and "Fillable text" layers, group them all together, and shift them by a random amount relative to the base design, before printing.</p>
<p dir="auto">Blockbuster also used VHS clamshells for SNES and Genesis cartridge distribution.  In these cases, the category is "GAMES SNES" or "GAMES GENESIS", rating "N/A". The title will likely have "SNES-" or "GENESIS-" prefixing the actual game title.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Author</h2><a id="user-content-author" aria-label="Permalink: Author" href="#author"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Reproduction created by <a href="https://www.finnie.org/" rel="nofollow">Ryan Finnie</a>. I'm not sure about the legal standing of a design semi-reproduction of a defunct company, but this template is licensed CC-BY-SA 4.0 International, to the extent it can be licensed.</p>
<p dir="auto">By the way, the location depicted on the template in Green Bay is a location I have pleasant memories of, having competed in the Blockbuster World Video Game Championships II competition in 1995, playing on the <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Donkey_Kong_Country_Competition_Cartridge" rel="nofollow">Donkey Kong Country Competition Cartridge</a>. I finished second place in the Nintendo division for that store.</p>

<p dir="auto">Get things from one computer to another, safely.</p>
<p dir="auto">This package provides a library and a command-line tool named <code>wormhole</code>,
which makes it possible to get arbitrary-sized files and directories
(or short pieces of text) from one computer to another. The two endpoints are
identified by using identical "wormhole codes": in general, the sending
machine generates and displays the code, which must then be typed into the
receiving machine.</p>
<p dir="auto">The codes are short and human-pronounceable, using a phonetically-distinct
wordlist. The receiving side offers tab-completion on the codewords, so
usually only a few characters must be typed. Wormhole codes are single-use
and do not need to be memorized.</p>

		Microsoft stands out from the authenticator crowd by annihilating accounts when new accounts are introduced via QR code. Despite user complaints for years, no fix has been issued, leaving IT experts wondering, ‘Why would you pick Microsoft?’	</h2>

<hr>







<p>With use of <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/563753/two-factor-authentication-2fa-explained.html">multi-factor authentication</a> rising, end-users can find themselves fiddling with codes and authentication apps frequently throughout their days. For those who rely on Microsoft Authenticator, the experience can go beyond momentary frustration to full-blown panic as they become locked out of their accounts.</p>



<p>That’s because, due to an issue involving which fields it uses, Microsoft Authenticator often overwrites accounts when a user adds a new account via QR scan — the most common method of doing so.&nbsp;</p>
</div> <!-- Closing grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column0 -->
								
					<div>


<p>But because of the way the resulting lockout happens, the user is not likely to realize the issue resides with Microsoft Authenticator. Instead, the company issuing the authentication is considered the culprit, resulting in wasted corporate helpdesk hours trying to fix an issue not of that company’s making.&nbsp;</p>






<p>The core of the problem? Microsoft Authenticator will overwrite an account with the same username. Given the prominent use of email addresses for usernames, most users’ apps share the same username. Google Authenticator and just about every other authenticator app add the name of the issuer — such as a bank or a car company — to avoid this issue. Microsoft only uses the username.</p>



<p>Making this situation worse is that when a Microsoft overwrite happens, it’s not easy to determine which account is being overwritten. This can cause authentication issues with both the newly created account and the account that is overwritten.&nbsp;Moreover, users can potentially not realize a previously created account was annihilated until they attempt to use it again, whether that’s weeks or months later.</p>
</div> <!-- Closing grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column1 -->
								
					<div>


<p>There are multiple workarounds. The easiest is for companies to use any other authentication app. Not using the QR code scan feature — and manually entering the code — will also sidestep the issue, which doesn’t appear to arise when the authenticated accounts belong to Microsoft.</p>



<p>CSO Online found complaints of this problem dating back to 2020, but it appears to have been in place since Microsoft Authenticator was released in June 2016. (For historical context, Google was the first Authenticator app, having been launched in 2010.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>One such complaint in 2020 noted the workaround to manually enter the information, but it was dismissed as not viable for an enterprise audience.</p>
</div> <!-- Closing grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column2 -->
								
					<div>


<p>“I believe the fix, sorry, I mean <em>workaround</em> for this is to use the Secret Key from the Identity Provider and manually type this into the Authenticator app during setup,” <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/721812/authenticator-will-overwrite-accounts-with-same-us">the user wrote</a>. “Unfortunately, this is not very helpful in an enterprise environment, especially when the average end user rarely knows anything about the inner workings of authentication, and seeing a random string of characters is intimidating.”</p>



<h2 id="a-big-problem-with-usability-and-cybersecurity">‘A big problem with usability and cybersecurity’</h2>



<p>This problem got attention recently when Australian IT consultant Brett Randall posted about it on LinkedIn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his post, Randall described participating in a recent vendor training session: “As we logged into their system, we were presented with a QR code to scan for MFA. A number of attendees opened Microsoft Authenticator, scanned the QR code, and proceeded to overwrite another application’s TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) key,” Randall wrote.</p>
</div> <!-- Closing grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column3 -->
								
					<div>


<p>“Here’s how it should work and how every other authenticator app out there — Google, Okta, etc. — work. When you scan a QR code for MFA, it generates a string with a series of values. Other apps take two of these values — the label and the issuer — and join them together to form the unique ID for that key. Microsoft, on the other hand, ignores the standard and just takes one value — the label. And that’s typically your email address. Which means, Microsoft Authenticator will overwrite the last TOTP key that used the same email address. This can be disastrous.”</p>



<p>He added: “Watching a room full of people lose access to other systems as they gradually scanned a QR code and Microsoft Authenticator overwrote their keys to other systems was painful. But trying to get Microsoft to recognize the issue and do something about it? That’s been nigh on impossible.”</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“If you haven’t picked an authentication app, why would you pick Microsoft?”</p><cite>— Tim Erlin, VP of product at Wallarm</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>CSO Online contacted various other security and IT specialists and asked them if they could re-create the problem. They all could.</p>
</div> <!-- Closing grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column4 -->
								
					<div>


<p>“The help-desk burden is not trivial. This is one where I think it’s a design flaw,” said Gary Longsine, fractional CTO at IllumineX. “As far as recommending the app, this would prevent me from using Microsoft Authenticator. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone for that reason.”</p>



<p>Tim Erlin, VP of product at Wallarm, said, “Users will be locked out and will need to get back in. Once you add one entry that is using the email address, the second entry will conflict. And once you have overwritten, you won’t know which one was overwritten.”</p>



<p>He added, “It’s possible that this problem occurs more often than anyone realizes because [users] don’t realize what the cause is. If you haven’t picked an authentication app, why would you pick Microsoft?”</p>
</div> <!-- Closing grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column5 -->
								
					<div>


<p>Erlin speculated that this problem initially happened because of an historic disconnect between security engineers and end-users. “This is a small example of a big problem with usability and cybersecurity. This is what happens when apps are developed by engineers who don’t have a strong knowledge of customers,” he said, adding that Microsoft hasn’t bothered to fix it because Microsoft Authenticator is a free product and therefore doesn’t generate revenue.</p>



<p>David Meltzer, chief product officer at Netography, re-created the problem and found it disconcerting. “I tried this to experience it myself. It is clearly a bug. It is a fairly straightforward thing [for Microsoft] to fix. Every other authenticator can handle it.”</p>



<p>Asked for comment, Google spokesperson Kimberly Samra wrote that “it’s correct that we don’t overwrite codes. That was an explicit decision.”</p>

<h2 id="microsoft-says-users-issuers-to-blame">Microsoft says users, issuers to blame</h2>



<p>Microsoft confirmed the issue but said it was a feature not a bug, and that it was the fault of users or companies that use the app for authentication.</p>



<p>Microsoft issued two written statements to CSO Online but declined an interview. Its first statement read: “We can confirm that our authenticator app is functioning as intended. When users scan a QR code, they will receive a message prompt that asks for confirmation before proceeding with any action that might overwrite their account settings. This ensures that users are fully aware of the changes they are making.”</p>



<p>One problem with that first statement is that it does not correctly reflect what the message says. The message says: “This action will overwrite existing security information for your account. To prevent being locked out of your account, continue only if you initiated this action from a trusted source.”</p>
</div> <!-- Closing grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column7 -->
								
					<div>


<p>The first sentence of the warning window is correct, in that the action will indeed overwrite the account. But the second sentence incorrectly tells the user to proceed as long as two conditions are met: that the user initiated the action; and that it is a trusted source. In almost all relevant situations, both would apply. The user did indeed initiate the action (as opposed to a cyberthief trying to break in) and the site (such as a bank or hotel) is trusted.</p>



<p>Therefore, a user following those instructions would proceed and overwrite the accounts. It’s also worth noting that the message offers no means of not overwriting the account, other than abandoning the entire authentication effort. Users following the instructions would experience the problematic overwrite.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few days after its initial response, Microsoft unprompted sent a different statement. The second one was much longer, blaming issuers:</p>
</div> <!-- Closing grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column8 -->
								
					<div>


<blockquote>
<p>“When you scan a QR code, the Authenticator app uses a label given by the vendor to set up your Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) account. However, some sites or vendors don’t include the issuer — the site name or Identity provider name — in the label. This may result in a situation where a user may already have an account with the same label and the app attempts to overwrite the existing TOTP account with the new one they are scanning. In situations where a user has an existing account with the same label, users are always presented with a message prompt to confirm overwriting an existing TOTP account in their app and can make a conscious choice to proceed or not. We are always working on enhancing our products and will take this into consideration and apply it to future improvements.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That last sentence is the only indication we have seen from Microsoft that it might fix the issue.</p>



<p>As for the actions of “some sites or vendors,” Randall said there are a limited number of ways to resolve this situation.</p>



<p>“It seems there are two options here to avoid end users accidentally overwriting other apps’ keys. We audit every application’s otpauth and go through the hassle of trying to convince every company doing it ‘wrong’ to fix it. Or Microsoft fixes this once and then we never have to worry about it again,” Randall said.</p>
</div> <!-- Closing grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column9 -->
								
					<div>


<p>“By the way, I’ve tested this behavior in 14 other authenticator apps so far. None of them exhibit the same collision behavior that Microsoft Authenticator does,” he added. “I gave up at 14 because at that point, it’s obvious Microsoft are the ones who are doing things poorly here.”</p>



<p>Randall listed the apps he tested: Google Authenticator by Google; Okta Verify by Okta; Duo Mobile by Duo Security; LastPass Authenticator by LastPass; 2FA Authenticator (2FAS) by Two Factor Authentication Service; Twilio Authy by Authy; Salesforce Authenticator by Salesforce; OneAuth by Zoho; ForgeRock Authenticator by ForgeRock; Authenticator 7 by SMM Service; Authenticator App by 2Stable; Auth0 Guardian by Auth0; OTP Auth by Roland Moers; and Authenticator 2FA Sentinel by Tommaso Carpi.</p>

<b><i>A</i></b>rtificial <b><i>LI</i></b>fe <b><i>EN</i></b>vironment <b>(ALIEN)</b> is an artificial life simulation tool based on a specialized 2D particle engine in CUDA for soft bodies and fluids. Each simulated body consists of a network of particles that can be upgraded with higher-level functions, ranging from pure information processing capabilities to physical equipment (such as sensors, muscles, weapons, constructors, etc.) whose executions are orchestrated by neural networks. The bodies can be thought of as agents or digital organisms operating in a common environment. Their blueprints can be stored in genomes and passed on to offspring.
</p>
<p dir="auto">
The simulation code is written entirely in CUDA and optimized for large-scale real-time simulations with millions of particles.
The development is driven by the desire to better understand the conditions for (pre-)biotic evolution and the growing complexity of biological systems.
An important goal is to make the simulator user-friendly through a modern user interface, visually appealing rendering and a playful approach.

<li>A first attempt to answer: Feed your curiosity by watching evolution at work! As soon as self-replicating machines come into play and mutations are turned on, the simulation itself does everything.</li>
<li>Perhaps the most honest answer: Fun! It is almost like a game with a pretty fast and realistic physics engine. You can make hundreds of thousands of machines accelerate and destroy with the mouse cursor. It feels like playing god in your own universe with your own rules. Different render styles and a visual editor offer fascinating insights into the events. There are a lot of videos on the <a href="https://youtube.com/channel/UCtotfE3yvG0wwAZ4bDfPGYw" rel="nofollow">YouTube channel</a> for illustration.</li>
<li>A more academic answer: A tool to tackle fundamental questions of how complexity or life-like structure may arise from simple components. How do entire ecosystems adapt to environmental changes and find a new equilibrium? How to find conditions that allow open-ended evolution?</li>

If this is not the case, a new Windows user could be created to solve this problem.</li>
<li>ALIEN needs write access to its own directory. This should normally be the case.</li>
<li>If you have multiple graphics cards, please check that your primary monitor is connected to the CUDA-powered card. ALIEN uses the same graphics card for computation as well as rendering and chooses the one with the highest compute capability.</li>
<li>If you possess both integrated and dedicated graphics cards, please ensure that the alien-executable is configured to use your high-performance graphics card. On Windows you need to access the 'Graphics settings,' add 'alien.exe' to the list, click 'Options,' and choose 'High performance'.</li>

Github has multiple flows that should cover most purposes here: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps" rel="nofollow">https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-ap...</a>. The key is that payment data is encoded in oAuth-like scopes, so all authorizations are scoped by amount and lifetime, and are implicitly merchant-specific.</p><p>Browser-based flow, where you're already logged into the bank in an existing browser tab:</p><p>* Amazon redirects you to oauth-proxy.visa.com where you select your bank (if you've done it already once, it remembers and redirects straight to your bank)</p><p>* Visa redirects you to your bank - if you're not logged in, you do a login - this is up to your bank on how to do that - authorize with an existing phone, WebAuthn, etc. On OSes supporting it, this URL can be hooked and handled directly by a native app which may use the device's secure element to store its auth credentials for the bank</p><p>* Bank displays you the payment request details (which include your Amazon account email, order ID, etc - all info you need to confirm it's indeed <i>your</i> payment request and not someone else's) and allows you to change them (maybe you want to authorize more or less, or make it one-time/recurring with a daily/weekly/monthly/yearly cap, or set an expiry after which the authorization is no longer valid)</p><p>* In the background, Amazon gets a success webhook from Visa (or their processor) saying that this authorization request has been granted, or they can poll an endpoint - this eliminates the need for a final redirect back to them like in normal oAuth</p><p>* If this is a recurring charge scenario, Amazon can store this payment request token against your account and use it multiple times, as long as the charges fall within the policy set during initial payment request establishment (if you set a max of $20, they can do as many transactions as they want up to a total of $20).</p><p>Device-based flow, where you aren't/don't want to login in to the bank the same browser:</p><p>* Amazon redirects to oauth.visa.com as above</p><p>* Instead of clicking on your bank directly, you say "authorize via phone", it just encodes the URL of the current page in a QR code so you can scan it on the phone - you then do the above flow there. Because the success/failure of a payment request is already communicated directly between the merchant and Visa, there is no need for your phone to pass any data back to the browser, so no need for a "reverse channel" to be set up.</p><p>* On your phone, you may have your banking app installed, so it takes over the domain name of your bank and automatically opens the payment request authorization there, using your existing session within the app.</p><p>Point is, not only is there no longer a concept of a card number that can be copied, stolen, or leaked, but the user also remains in control - they can control whether the payment is one-time or recurring, set limits on recurring payments, and be able to cancel these authorizations at any time, after which they're guaranteed that nobody can take more money without going through this auth process again. This eliminates many reasons for chargebacks, and reduces fraud risks for merchants too (merchants are no longer vulnerable since the auth to authorize a new payment request is between the user and their bank directly), so things like behavioral fraud detection or captchas on payment pages are no longer needed.</p><p>Downside (for scammers): business models based on a free trial that rely on the user forgetting to cancel, or those who intentionally make cancellation annoying or impossible wouldn't work, because payment requests should list upfront the max amount they can take, and the user can adjust that and make sure the unwanted charge just won't go through even if they tried.</p></div></td></tr>

What’s needed is an oAuth2-type system where every payment needs to redirect to the bank (actual redirect, no stupid hacky iframe like SCA/3DSecure is) and where you can see the merchant and set the max amount (and whether one-off or recurring) and the bank records that and keeps a list of authorized merchants so you can revoke them at any time. The merchant then <i>must</i> use this token to pull money, and can't pull more than what the token allows - just like your usual oAuth2 scopes.</p></div></td></tr>

                  <p>You're right that it's not fully enforced technically. It's complicated, and I don't think that's really solvable by technology (being that this scenario is roughly equivalent to direct debiting). Banks can validate if a particular merchant has already been used by a customer and blocking them from debiting your account, but since that SCA has exceptions for recurring debiting, this is not really enforcable once the customer has authorized the merchant for any debiting.</p>

Instead of the chip, you get either a 2nd authentication mechanism, or start out with a strong token (be it the strength of the token itself, or the stability of it).</p><p>An older example was getting transaction authorisation numbers. You would either get a long indexed list on paper, or you could receive then over the phone (voice or text). This was then mostly replaced (about 10 years ago) with hardware (H/T)OTP type tokens that required your card to be inserted in the token and PIN authenticated. Later on that too was replaced by a cardless version, and that one then was replaced (for consumers) with mobile apps.</p><p>The combination of minimum software versions, online authentication, transaction limits, daily limits, and time-locked temporary limit increases (so you can buy a car with your phone, but you have to up the limit a couple of hours ahead of time for it to take effect) make it pretty safe with acceptable risk for the bank. And then there's of course the standard fraud detection and prevention departments, so if you do something unusual that also involves a lot of money, you're likely going to get a call.</p><p>For business use, there are other systems, generally two types like EU-wide smartcards or bank-specific smartcards that can be used to authenticate and authorise. You'd use an USB or NFC connected method for that. Sometimes that involves entering a PIN on the device itself before the computer can talk to it, but that does make the OTP exchange very fast. You'd still have limits or multiparty authorisation setup in your organisation so you don't end up with one person just moving a couple of 100K around on their own.</p><p>And then there's some overlapping systems, apparently this one is going EU-wide: h<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIDAS" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIDAS</a> and apparently some implementations include useful things: <a href="https://www.idin.nl/en/businesses/" rel="nofollow">https://www.idin.nl/en/businesses/</a> like age confirmation where the business doesn't need to know who, what or where you are just if you're of age (and not even a specific age). Granted, nothing is perfect, but it's a whole lot better than finding some S3 bucket somewhere with JPEGs of ID cards. As long as they don't do dumb stuff like trying to MITM TLS, it's progress. The overlap is in the concept where you can use some electronic means to prove who you are to get something done.</p></div></td></tr>

In the US it's increasingly uncommon to buy things with cash or cash-equivalents (Venmo, Zelle, etc.), especially high-value items.</p><p>Basically we have very few consumer protection laws compared to the EU, and it's very much a "buyer beware" culture here. If you get screwed by a merchant, most of the time it's just too bad for you, unless the merchant has a good return policy (most big box stores do, most small places don't). We don't have the regulatory protections that EU has.</p><p>So credit cards have sprung up to offer not just buy on borrowed money, but also purchase protections that live outside the legal/regulatory frameworks. When you buy something with a credit card, you get charged interest by the bank and the merchant also pays a fee. Some tiny part of those fees get pooled into these protection (and other) services that the card offers its members.</p><p>For example, depending on your credit card, some will automatically extend the warranty of things you buy by another year or two. Or price protection is that if the thing you buy goes on sale within 30 days and you find it for a cheaper price, the credit card provider (not the merchant) will issue you a partial refund. The chargeback system is often used for disputing issues (maybe you bought something from an overseas vendor who never delivered and never bothered to answer your emails, or maybe they lied about their return, or maybe provided some terrible product). You file a claim with the credit card company, not the government or the merchant, and the card issuer will mediate on your behalf. If the amount is low enough, they'll often just refund you without a full investigation (it's not worth their time). But it also serves as a sort of review &amp; punishment system for merchants... those who get too high a volume of chargebacks will incur higher fees or be blocked altogether by the credit card issuers, meaning merchants are incentivized to fix customer issues.</p><p>Merchants not accepting credit cards here do exist, but they're relatively rare, because so much of the population uses credit cards instead of anything else.

                  <p>Since a few years ago, the ECB is already looking into the possibilities for implementing a digital euro as another way of paying across the entire Eurozone. The phrase "digital euro" has been kind of a political boogeyman because of the privacy concerns (fair) and implications that the physical euro might disappear (less fair, the right to be able to use it as legal tender is enshrined in the EU treaties and that can't be changed without everyone agreeing to it), but the base idea is to create a public infrastructure that would do what payment processors and credit card companies are doing for a hefty fee right now. Which, to me, sounds like a great answer to this problem.</p>

I am going to give my best tl;dr based on my experience and knowledge.</p><p>From my point of view it isn’t really about partner banks. It’s about the rails, nearly 100% about the rails (IE the network). You’d only need one partner bank to move funds, which is how CashApp does it for example, but payment networks (the rails) is a different beast all together and I’ll do my best to outline this.</p><p>The bigger problem is going to be the rails. Visa and Mastercard as a model wouldn’t make as much sense for a new system to start with, rather you would want to be a closed loop system like American Express and Discover, because it’s extremely unlikely you’re going to be lowering any fees if you have to transit on Mastercard or Visa, but this means you have to control the entire on ramp, from issuing cards to operating the network. This as time has gone on has gotten very complicated from a regulatory standpoint and much of it for good reason, not to mention the high entry cost and long tail time it will take to see adoption. In fact you would likely run up against the reason why fees are so high, which I will get into in a minute. This is all the reasons why Capital One is trying to buy Discover, because they want to lower their fees for their cards so they can net more profit per transaction with lower per transaction costs, but this won’t translate into anything being cheaper for merchants (which is what we are really talking about) because of one really big draw of credit cards: Rewards[0]</p><p>The biggest driver of higher over time transaction costs isn’t the operation of the network. Which does cost money and it is unlikely operating any network would be zero cost or near zero cost, but rewards balloon the cost to merchants because of how things are structured and incentivized.</p><p>In a very simplistic breakdown it goes like this: if I am a card issuer like a bank, American Express or Discover and offer rewards, someone has to pay for that. Now you think the sky high interest rates would be enough but, while they in part cover the costs of the bank and they make lots of money on this, the truth is rewards are funded in large part (and sometimes solely) by kick backs on fees paid by merchants to the network operators, e.g. Visa, who may charge 3% they may only keep 0.50% of that and pass the rest back to the issuer as a kick back. This is negotiated by a number of means and the percentages are all different based on a bunch of factors but this is essentially how it works. This in part is done to incentive more transactions over the card network, particularly as a credit transaction which isn’t fee regulated, where as debit cards have a legal limit, which averages out to ~7 cents per transaction, significantly lower than credit cards.</p><p>Now this has created a system of kickbacks and rewards. This benefits three parties: Banks, who get tons of profits off of the high interest on credit cards plus the kickbacks fund rewards. Savvy (and usually wealthy) consumers, who can effectively get the “tax” in higher prices this has observed to cause over time as fees rise paid back to them as rewards at no cost (full paid monthly balances) and the network operators.</p><p>This leaves merchants to bare the real burden, as well as consumers who haven’t or otherwise unable to take advantage of reward programs to offset costs, namely the poor and lower middle class folks.</p><p>Now knowing this, how would you build up a 3 sided network (the operator, the consumer and a bank) that upends this model, which lowers fees for merchants? Assuming you go with a closed loop model (likely the best move) you are left with a few options: lower rewards (or have none, realistically) and you won’t gain consumers. Lower the operator take which has risks the ability for operations to be profitable and regulatory compliant, or you need to fund in large part by merchant fees greater than 1%, which will inch you close to what you see today to begin with, or you may think to use “differential pricing” but in some instances this may enter into a questionable gray area legally to have differential pricing based on which network / payment method the customer uses and it can be burdensome to merchants, which in part is why Winco decided to very publicly disclose that they only take debit cards, for example. Finally, you could forgo all this and simply rely on credit card interest revenue but that is a surprisingly volatile proposition as you have defaults to consider, refunds, reward costs, security and regulatory compliance etc.</p><p>All the while you need to build out a network from scratch by working with merchants, which means you would have very slow adoption and users of the network wouldn’t be able to blindly use their cards where they shop today, because it’s not like you can tap into Visa or Mastercard networks as a back stop either[1]</p><p>For what it’s worth, you should do a deep dive on how retailers tried and failed to upend all this with their own ACH based payment systems, the biggest proponent of which was Walmart. They failed for a lot of reasons but not all of them are the reasons you think.</p><p>[0]: <a href="https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/who-pays-generous-credit-card-rewards#:~:text=Wang%20finds%20that%20networks%20are,increased%20costs%20on%20to%20consumers" rel="nofollow">https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/who-pays-ge...</a>.</p><p>[1]: I’m not a lawyer but I’m almost certain they have no legal obligation to allow anyone on their network even after the settlement awhile back</p></div></td></tr>

Moving stuff in a ledger from A to B (sending money around in general) is all fairly trivial from a technology standpoint, but only a minuscule part of what financial institutions are doing. They spend a lot of money and effort on combatting fraud and making sure rules and regulations (KYC, AML, CTF, sanctions, etc.) are being followed.</p><p>(The crypto bros (and some FinTechs) solve a tiny part of the puzzle with a new technology (not even good/efficient tech in case of crypto), and then think that they alone have solved it, and that the rest is easy, and that they are now in a position to take over finance. Not so.)</p><p>2. Costs vary tremendously by jurisdiction and industry structure. In Europe, bank transfers within the SEPA region are basically free (instantaneous transfers might cost 35 cents or so). Bank transfers, direct debit, and standing orders have been ubiquitous and cheap for a long time, and checks and credit cards are rarely used (on the continent; the UK is closer to the US system). There was no need for PayPal, as it was fairly trivial to pay bills. (Only when Ebay bought PayPal and made it the default payment method did PayPal get any traction in Europe, I think.)</p><p>Similarly, credit card interchange fees are capped at 0.5% in the EU. That means fewer card rewards (which arguably benefit mostly the rich), and less credit card marketing.</p><p>The banking system in the US is quite crap, but that's not due to stupidity, but a mix of a) well intended regulation that intends to support small regional banks, b) misguided business-friendly regulation with insufficient consumer protection.</p><p>2.b. I think Visa/MC/Amex are ridiculously expensive in many jurisdictions, and that they basically skim off some 2% or so of the entire retail revenue is ridiculous. They should be treated as cheap infrastructure. But this requires sensible regulation. It's not a technological issue.</p><p>3. There are lots of somewhat successful neo-banks, neo-brokers, etc. in many jurisdictions. I don't think many of them have extraordinary profits. And that's because, no, it's not "all coming from inefficiency and lack of real competition". Sure, the sector is so heavily regulated (like aviation) that you can't just walk in and compete willy-nilly. That has some downsides, but it also has advantages.</p><p>4. A bank that makes insufficient profits and tethers on the brink of insolvency invites bank runs. That's one reason regulators are not pushing too hard for more competition. (Replacing the current fractional banking system with private credit + narrow banking might be an option, but that's a huge and complicated topic...)</p><p>For deep insight, I recommend <i>Bits about Money</i> by Patrick McKenzie (patio 11 on HN).</p><p><a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com</a></p><p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=patio11">https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=patio11</a></p></div></td></tr>

its tens of billions spread across a bunch of different organizations, honestly if you count Stripe, PayPal etc as well, you are in the hundreds of billions.

I managed to watch most of Schmidt’s chat with Stanford’s Erik Brynjolfsson before it was taken down, however, and something else he said stands out. (You can still <a href="https://github.com/ociubotaru/transcripts/blob/main/Stanford_ECON295%E2%A7%B8CS323_I_2024_I_The_Age_of_AI%2C_Eric_Schmidt.txt">read the full transcript here</a>.)</p><p>While talking about a future world in which AI agents can do complex tasks on behalf of humans, Schmidt says:</p><div><blockquote><p>If TikTok is banned, here’s what I propose each and every one of you do: Say to your LLM the following: “Make me a copy of TikTok, steal all the users, steal all the music, put my preferences in it, produce this program in the next 30 seconds, release it, and in one hour, if it’s not viral, do something different along the same lines.”</p><p>That’s the command. Boom, boom, boom, boom.</p></blockquote></div><p>A bit later, Schmidt returns to his TikTok example and says:</p><div><blockquote><p>So, in the example that I gave of the TikTok competitor — and by the way, I was not arguing that you should illegally steal everybody’s music — what you would do if you’re a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, which hopefully all of you will be, is if it took off, then you’d hire a whole bunch of lawyers to go clean the mess up, right? But if nobody uses your product, it doesn’t matter that you stole all the content.</p><p>And do not quote me.</p></blockquote></div><p>At this point, Brynjolfsson points out that, “You’re on camera,” to which Schmidt responds:</p><div><blockquote><p>Yeah, that’s right. But you see my point. In other words, Silicon Valley will run these tests and clean up the mess. And that’s typically how those things are done.</p></blockquote></div><p>While Schmidt stepped away from his chairman role at Google in 2015, he remains influential in Silicon Valley and a prolific investor in startups. During this same talk at Stanford, he touts his investment in the AI startup Mistral and being “a licensed arms dealer” to the US military. He also calls Sam Altman “a close friend,” and recalls a recent dinner he had with Elon Musk while praising what the Tesla CEO “gets out of people” who work for him.</p><p>I emailed Schmidt and Brynjolfsson requesting comment about the removal of their chat from YouTube and haven’t heard back yet. Schmidt earlier <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-eric-schmidt-ai-remote-work-stanford-f92f4ca5">told <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a><em> </em>that he “misspoke about Google and their work hours” and requested the video be taken down.</p><div><form><div><h2>Command Line</h2><p> / <span>A newsletter from Alex Heath about the tech industry’s inside conversation.</span></p></div></form></div></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/16/24221826/olympics-paris-what-happened-air-conditioning-heat"><h2>What happened to all the temporary air conditioning units at the Olympic Village?</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/16/24221353/eric-schmidt-says-the-quiet-part-out-loud"><h2>Eric Schmidt says the quiet part out loud</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/16/24221721/gemini-google-pixel-apple-app-pricing-tv-shootout-vergecast"><h2>Gemini is taking over Google</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/16/24221755/google-team-pixel-reviews-influencers"><h2>Google threatened tech influencers unless they ‘preferred’ the Pixel</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24220359/google-pixel-9-camera-bar-small-phones-claude-zellweger-interview"><h2>Google’s head of Pixel 9 design won’t apologize for its big, beautiful camera bump</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

    The National Security Agency uses a bit of jiu-jitsu to turn the structure of Web ad networks against people who run Tor to remain anonymous.
  </p> <div data-cy="globalAuthorImage"><div><picture> <img src="https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/b3de236b7cb04b156d5707a66f2137f1b27ecc10/hub/2013/01/16/d55fbd2d-eacb-11e2-8339-d4ae52e62bcc/SETH_ROSENBLATT-1396.jpg?auto=webp&amp;fit=crop&amp;height=96&amp;width=96" alt="" height="96" width="96"> <!----></picture></div> <div section="authorCard" id="author-card-0"> <p>Senior writer Seth Rosenblatt covered Google and security for CNET News, with occasional forays into tech and pop culture.

Just because the <span section="shortcodeLink"><a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/nsa-sought-to-unmask-users-of-net-privacy-tool-tor-says-report/" rel="follow"><span>National Security Agency hasn't cracked the anonymizing service Tor</span></a></span> doesn't mean that people who use the service are free from surveillance.
</p> <p>
The NSA has been able to use ad networks like Google's, and The Onion Router's own entry and exit nodes on the Internet, to follow some Tor users, according to a new report based on documents leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden and obtained by <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/tor-attacks-nsa-users-online-anonymity" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">security researcher Bruce Schneier with the Guardian</a>. Tor is primarily funded by the US State Department and the Department of Defense, home of the NSA. 
</p>  <p><a href="https://www.torproject.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Tor promotes itself</a> as helping people "defend against traffic analysis, a form of network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships, and state security."
</p><p>
Robert Hansen, a browser specialist at the security firm White Hat Security, said that Tor access node tracking is not new.
</p><p>
"A couple of years ago a hacking group published exactly 100 embassy passwords from Tor exit nodes. One hundred is too round of a number," he said. "Just logically there must be more. If you get enough exit nodes and entrance nodes, they can be correlated together."
</p><p>
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper <a href="http://icontherecord.tumblr.com/post/63103784923/dni-statement-why-the-intelligence-community" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">criticized</a> reporters and denied that his office was doing anything illegal, citing the threat of "adversaries."  
</p><blockquote>
The articles fail to mention that the Intelligence Community is only interested in communication related to valid foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes and that we operate within a strict legal framework that prohibits accessing information related to the innocent online activities of US citizens.
</blockquote> <p>
The system that the NSA uses to locate and identify Tor users begins, at least sometimes, with the buying of ads on networks like Google's AdSense. 
</p><p>
"Just because you're using Tor doesn't mean that your browser isn't storing cookies," said Jeremiah Grossman, a colleague of Hansen's who also specializes in browser vulnerabilities.
</p><p>
As Grossman described the procedure to CNET, the NSA is aware of Tor's entry and exit nodes because of its Internet-wide surveillance.
</p><p>
"The very feature that makes Tor a powerful anonymity service, and the fact that all Tor users look alike on the Internet, makes it easy to differentiate Tor users from other Web users," he wrote.
</p><p>
The NSA buys ads from ad display companies like Google and seeds them around Tor's access points.

"The NSA then cookies that ad, so that every time you go to a site, the cookie identifies you. Even though your IP address changed [because of Tor], the cookies gave you away," he said.
</p><p>
This is not some complicated or even an unusual trick, Grossman said. It's how tracking ads were intended to function. 
</p><p>
"That's the Web by design, not a hack," he said.
</p><p>
The NSA, he said, is not spending much money on it since Internet ads are so cheap. Grossman speculated that an ad campaign would only cost around $1,000 to seed ads with the NSA's cookies around the Web. 
</p> <p>
"$50,000 would be overkill," he said.
</p><p>
Because the NSA is essentially using how the Web functions to spy on its users, tools like Tortilla that <span section="shortcodeLink"><a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/tortilla-tool-makes-anonymizer-tor-more-digestible/" rel="follow"><span>take the burden of Tor usage away from Firefox</span></a></span> wouldn't prevent the NSA's tracking ads from finding people.
</p><p>
It wouldn't be feasible for Google to block ad buys from the NSA, and if the company did, he said, "they could just buy through a proxy."
</p><p>
Google did not respond to a request for comment.
</p><p>
Both <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/yes-we-know-about-guardian-article" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Tor itself</a> and Schneier noted that the NSA has not been able to track every Tor user this way. "They are hard for any organization other than the NSA to reliably execute, because they require the attacker to have a privileged position on the Internet backbone," Schneier said.
</p><p>
Grossman speculated that the NSA could be using spam e-mail campaigns as it's been using display ads, though he cautioned that he didn't have evidence that this was actually happening. 
</p><p>
"On the off chance that [the spam recipient] renders the HTML or clicks a link, [the NSA] can connect your e-mail address to your browser," he explained, which the NSA would have already connected to an IP address. "Using Tor or any proxy wouldn't prevent it."
</p><p>
Not all Tor installations are created equal, added Hansen, who has an unusual pedigree in the browser vulnerability field because he's also a veteran of the ValueClick ad network, which was later bought by DoubleClick, which subsequently was purchased by Google.
</p><p>
"It depends on whether you're using Tor Button or Tor Browser," he said. "The Tor Button tends to be more secure because as you jump in and out of the Tor Browser, it tracks cache and cookies." 
</p><p>
However, since the Tor Project now includes a patched version of Firefox, it recommends <a href="https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">not using the Tor Button</a> and only using the standard <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Tor Browser Bundle</a> instead.
</p><p>
More secure than either, Hansen said, was to run Tor on a virtual machine so that cookies and cache are dumped when the machine is closed, and the kind of man-in-the-middle and man-on-the-side attacks described by Schneier are avoided.
</p><p>
"If you don't <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download#warning" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">take the critical steps to protect your privacy</a>, you will be de-cloaked if you're doing something interesting," Hansen said.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><p>Elon Musk’s X has been ordered to pay compensation to a former staff member of its Irish unit in an unfair dismissal case.</p><div>



<p>The social network platform formerly known as Twitter was ordered to pay out over €550,000 ($602,640) to the former employee, Ireland’s Workplace Relations Commission, the state body responsible for adjudicating employment disputes, said on Tuesday. It is the largest sum the agency has ever awarded, according to Irish broadcaster RTE.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gary Rooney, who held a senior procurement role at the time of his dismissal in December 2022, had been employed by the company since September 2013. The Commission heard that the social media platform maintained that the employee had resigned voluntarily after he failed to tick a box committing to new unspecified working arrangements in an email from the company’s new owner Musk. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Rooney was one of thousands of Twitter employees sent an email by Musk requiring them to pledge to stay with the company, working long hours at “high intensity” during its transformation, or to accept a buyout. Staff were given a day to click “yes” to agree to unspecified employment terms.</p>



<p>The commission rejected X’s argument that Rooney quit voluntarily and ruled that not clicking “yes” in response to the email did not constitute an act of resignation.</p>



<p>“It is not OK for Mr. Musk, or indeed any large company to treat employees in such a manner in this country or jurisdiction. The record award reflects the seriousness and the gravity of the case,” the complainant’s solicitor Barry Kenny told Bloomberg.</p>



<p>It’s one in a string of cases that have sprung up since Musk purchased the platform. Multiple lawsuits have already alleged that Twitter employees didn’t receive their promised severance benefits, while the site has come under more intense scrutiny since he acquired it.</p>



<p>The dispute arose in Dublin after billionaire Musk took ownership of the platform in late 2022. The Irish capital had about 500 employees before the takeover, but has since been impacted by the global staff exodus from the firm.</p>



<p>The WRC in its 73-page ruling stated the emails had been sent “at a time of rapid change in Twitter and in the context of inconsistent, contradictory and confusing communications from the Respondent in connection with the takeover of the Company by Mr. Musk.”</p>



<p>X didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The company can lodge an appeal to the Labour Court within 42 days.&nbsp;</p></div><p><strong>Recommended Newsletter:</strong> The Fortune Next to Lead newsletter is a must-read for the next generation of C-suite leaders.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<p> by:  <b> Ethan McCue</b></p>

<p>This is one part actionable advice, one part question for the audience.</p>
<p>Advice: When you are making a new application that requires persistent storage of data, like is the case for most web applications, your default choice should be <code>Postgres</code>.</p>
<h3 id="why-not-sqlite">Why not <code>sqlite</code>?</h3>
<p><code>sqlite</code> is a pretty good database, but its data is stored in a single file.</p>
<p>This implies that whatever your application is, it is running on one machine and one machine only. Or at least one shared filesystem.</p>
<p>If you are making a desktop or mobile app, that's perfect. If you are making a website it might not be.</p>
<p>There are many success stories of using <code>sqlite</code> for a website, but they mostly involve people who set up their own servers and infrastructure. Platforms as a service-s like Heroku, Railway, Render, etc. generally expect you to use a database accessed over network boundary. It's not <em>wrong</em> to give up some of the benefits of those platforms, but do consider if the benefits of <code>sqlite</code> are worth giving up platform provided automatic database backups and the ability to provision more than one application server.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html">The official documentation</a> has a good guide with some more specifics.</p>
<h3 id="why-not-dynamodb-cassandra-or-mongodb">Why not <code>DynamoDB</code>, <code>Cassandra</code>, or <code>MongoDB</code>?</h3>
<p>Wherever Ray Houlihan is, I hope he is having a good day.</p>
<p>I watch a lot of conference talks, but his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaEPXoXVf2k">2018 DynamoDB Deep Dive</a> might be the one I've watched the most. I know very few of you are going to watch an hour-long talk, but you really should. It's a good one.</p>
<p>The thrust of it is that databases that are in the same genre as <code>DynamoDB</code> - which includes <code>Cassandra</code> and <code>MongoDB</code> - are fantastic <strong>if</strong> - and this is a load bearing if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You know exactly what your app needs to do, up-front</li>
<li>You know exactly what your access patterns will be, up-front</li>
<li>You have a known need to scale to really large sizes of data</li>
<li>You are okay giving up some level of consistency</li>
</ul>
<p>This is because this sort of database is basically a giant distributed hash map. The only operations that work without needing to scan the entire database are lookups by partition key and scans that make use of a sort key.</p>
<p>Whatever queries you need to make, you need to encode that knowledge in one of those indexes before you store it. You want to store users and look them up by either first name or last name? Well you best have a sort key that looks like <code>&lt;FIRST NAME&gt;$&lt;LAST NAME&gt;</code>. Your access patterns should be baked into how you store your data. If your access patterns change significantly, you might need to reprocess all of your data.</p>
<p>It's annoying because, especially with <code>MongoDB</code>, people come into it having been sold on it being a more "flexible" database. Yes, you don't need to give it a schema. Yes, you can just dump untyped JSON into collections. No, this is not a flexible kind of database. It is an efficient one.</p>
<p>With a relational database you can go from getting all the pets of a person to getting all the owners of a pet by slapping an index or two on your tables. With this genre of NoSQL, that can be a tall order.</p>
<p>Its also not amazing if you need to run analytics queries. Arbitrary questions like "How many users signed up in the last month" can be trivially answered by writing a SQL query, perhaps on a read-replica if you are worried about running an expensive query on the same machine that is dealing with customer traffic. It's just outside the scope of this kind of database. You need to be ETL-ing your data out to handle it.</p>
<p>If you see a college student or fresh grad using <code>MongoDB</code> stop them. They need help. They have been led astray.</p>
<h3 id="why-not-valkey">Why not <code>Valkey</code>?</h3>
<p>The artist formerly known as <code>Redis</code> is best known for being an efficient out-of-process cache. You compute something expensive once and slap it in <code>Valkey</code> so all 5 or so HTTP servers you have don't need to recompute it.</p>
<p>However, you <em>can</em> use it as your primary database. It stores all its data in RAM, so it's pretty fast if you do that.</p>
<p>Obvious problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can only have so much RAM. You can have a lot more than you'd think, but its still pretty limited compared to hard drives.</li>
<li>Same as the <code>DynamoDB</code>-likes, you need to make concessions on how you model your data.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-not-datomic">Why not <code>Datomic</code>?</h3>
<p>If you already knew about this one, you get a gold star.</p>
<p><code>Datomic</code> is a <code>NoSQL</code> database, but it is a relational one. The "up-front design" problems aren't there, and it does have some neat properties.</p>
<p>You don't store data in tables. It's all "entity-attribute-value-time" (EAVT) pairs. Instead of a person row with <code>id</code>, <code>name</code>, and <code>age</code> you store <code>1 :person/name "Beth"</code> and <code>1 :person/age 30</code>. Then your queries work off of "universal" indexes.</p>
<p>You don't need to coordinate with writers when making queries. You query the database "as-of" a given time. New data, even deletions (or as they call them "retractions"), don't actually delete old data.</p>
<p>But there are some significant problems</p>
<ul>
<li>It only works with JVM languages.</li>
<li>Outside of <code>Clojure</code>, a relatively niche language, its API sucks.</li>
<li>If you structure a query badly the error messages you get are terrible.</li>
<li>The whole universe of tools that exist for SQL just aren't there.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-not-xtdb">Why not <code>XTDB</code>?</h3>
<p><code>Clojure</code> people make a lot of databases.</p>
<p><code>XTDB</code> is spiritually similar do <code>Datomic</code> but:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is an HTTP api, so you aren't locked to the JVM.</li>
<li>It has two axes of time you can query against. "System Time" - when records were inserted - and "Valid Time."</li>
<li>It has a SQL API.</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest points against it are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's new. Its SQL API is something that popped up in the last year. It recently changed its whole storage model. Will the company behind it survive the next 10 years? Who knows!</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay that's just one point. I'm sure I could think of more, but treat this as a stand-in for any recently developed database. The best predictor something will continue to exist into the future is how long it has existed. COBOL been around for decades, it will likely continue to exist for decades.</p>
<p>If you have persistent storage, you want as long a support term as you can get. You can certainly choose to pick a newer or experimental database for your app but, regardless of technical properties, that's a risky choice. It shouldn't be your default.</p>
<h3 id="why-not-kafka">Why not <code>Kafka</code>?</h3>
<p><code>Kafka</code> is an append only log. It can handle TBs of data. It is a very good append only log. It works amazingly well if you want to do event sourcing type stuff with data flowing in from multiple services maintained by multiple teams of humans.</p>
<p>But:</p>
<ul>
<li>Up to a certain scale, a table in Postgres works perfectly fine as an append only log.</li>
<li>You likely do not have hundreds of people working on your product nor TBs of events flowing in.</li>
<li>Making a Kafka consumer is a bit more error-prone than you'd expect. You need to keep track of your place in the log after all.</li>
<li>Even when maintained by a cloud provider (and there are good managed <code>Kafka</code> services) its another piece of infrastructure you need to monitor.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-not-elasticsearch">Why not <code>ElasticSearch</code>?</h3>
<p>Is searching over data the primary function of your product?</p>
<p>If yes, <code>ElasticSearch</code> is going to give you some real pros. You will need to ETL your data into it and manage that whole process, but <code>ElasticSearch</code> is built for searching. It does searching good.</p>
<p>If no, <code>Postgres</code> will be fine. A sprinkling of <code>ilike</code> and the built-in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch.html">full text search</a> is more than enough for most applications. You can always bolt on a dedicated search thing later.</p>
<h3 id="why-not-mssql-or-oracle-db">Why not <code>MSSQL</code> or <code>Oracle DB</code>?</h3>
<p>Genuine question you should ask yourself: Are these worth the price tag?</p>
<p>I don't just mean the straight-up cost to license, but also the cost of lock-in. Once your data is in <code>Oracle DB</code> you are going to be paying Oracle forever. You are going to have to train your coders on its idiosyncrasies, forever. You are going to have to decide between enterprise features and your wallet, forever.</p>
<p>I know its super unlikely that you will contribute a patch to <code>Postgres</code>, so I won't pretend that there is some magic "power of open source" going on, but I think you should have a very specific need in mind to choose a proprietary DB. If you don't have some killer <code>MSSQL</code> feature that you simply cannot live without, don't use it.</p>
<h3 id="why-not-mysql">Why not <code>MySQL</code>?</h3>
<p>This is the one that I need some audience help with.</p>
<p><code>MySQL</code> is owned by Oracle. There are <a href="https://www.mysql.com/products/enterprise/compare/">features locked behind their enterprise editions</a>. To an extent you will have lock-in issues the same as any other DB.</p>
<p>But the free edition <code>MySQL</code> has also been used in an extremely wide range of things. It's been around for a long time. There are people who know how to work with it.</p>
<p>My problem is that I've only spent ~6 months of my professional career working with it. I genuinely don't know enough to compare it intelligently to <code>Postgres</code>.</p>
<p>I'm convinced it isn't secretly so much better that I am doing folks a disservice when telling them to use <code>Postgres</code>, and I do remember reading about how <code>Postgres</code> generally has better support for enforcing invariants in the DB itself, but I wouldn't mind being schooled a bit here.</p>
<h3 id="why-not-some-ai-vector-db">Why not some AI vector DB?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Most are new. Remember the risks of using something new.</li>
<li>AI is a bubble. A load-bearing bubble, but a bubble. Don't build a house on it if you can avoid it.</li>
<li>Even if your business is another AI grift, you probably only need to <code>import openai</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-not-google-sheets">Why not Google Sheets?</h3>
<p>You're right. I can't think of any downsides. Go for it.</p>

<p>It's been four years since <em>Fortnite</em>, one of the world's most popular games, was pulled from the Apple App Store in a blaze of controversy and finger-pointing. Today, it's returning to the iPhone—but only in the European Union.</p>
<p>Today marks the launch of the Epic Games Store on Android and iOS—iOS just in Europe, Android worldwide. Right now, it just has three games: <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Rocket League Sideswipe</em>, and <em>Fall Guys</em>. And you'll have to be in Europe to access it on your iPhone.</p>
<p>The Epic Games Store is run by Epic Games, the same company that develops and publishes <em>Fortnite</em>. Most folks who have been paying attention to either Epic or Apple in recent years knows the story at this point, but here's the quick summary and analysis.</p>
<h2>Opinion: Users are still the losers after four years</h2>
<p>At the direction of CEO Tim Sweeney, Epic knowingly made changes to <em>Fortnite</em> related to digital payments that violated Apple's terms for developers on the platform. Apple removed <em>Fortnite</em> accordingly, and a long, ugly PR and legal battle ensued between the two companies in multiple countries and regions.</p>
<p>In the US, a judge's decision granted some small wins to Epic and other developers seeking to loosen Apple's grip on the platform, but it kept the status quo for the most part.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Things went a little differently in Europe. EU legislators and regulators enacted the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which had far-reaching implications for how Apple and Google run their app stores. Among other things, the new law required Apple to allow third-party, alternative app stores (basically, sideloading) on the iPhone.</p>
<p>Apple's compliance was far from enthusiastic (the company cited security and privacy concerns for users, which is valid, but the elephant in the room is, of course, its confident grip on app revenues on its platforms), and it was criticized for trying to put up barriers. Additionally, Apple rejected Epic's attempts to launch its app store multiple times for a few arcane reasons amid a flurry of almost comically over-the-top tweets from Sweeney criticizing the company.</p>
<p>Despite Apple's foot-dragging, Epic has finally reached the point where it could launch its app store. Epic had already launched a relatively successful App Store on PC, where Valve's Steam holds a strong grip on users. The new iPhone app store doesn't offer nearly as many options or perks as the PC version, but Epic says it's working on wrangling developers onto its store.</p>
<p>It also says it will release its games on other alternative app stores on iOS and Android, such as AltStore PAL.</p>
<p>It's been a long, winding, angry path to get to this point. In the battle between Epic and Apple, there remains some debate about who really has won up to this point. But there isn't much dispute that, whether you want to blame Apple or Epic or both, users sure haven't been the winners.</p>

<p dir="auto">Typical use scenarios:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>archive your private conversations from Slack when the administrator
does not allow you to install applications OR you don't want to use
potentially privacy-violating third-party tools,</li>
<li>archive channels from Slack when you're on a free "no archive" subscription,
so you don't lose valuable knowledge in those channels,</li>
<li>create a Slack Export archive without admin access, or</li>
<li>save your favourite emojis.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">There are four modes of operation (more on this in <a href="https://github.com/rusq/slackdump/blob/master/doc/README.rst">User Guide</a>) :</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>List users/channels</li>
<li>Dumping messages and threads</li>
<li>Creating a Slack Export in Mattermost or Standard modes.</li>
<li>Emoji download mode.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Slackdump accepts two types of input (see <a href="https://github.com/rusq/slackdump/blob/master/doc/usage-channels.rst">Dumping Conversations</a> section):</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>the URL/link of the channel or thread, OR</li>
<li>the ID of the channel.</li>
</ol>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a href="#id4">Quick Start</a></h2><a id="user-content-quick-start" aria-label="Permalink: Quick Start" href="#quick-start"></a></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Download the latest release for your operating system from the <a href="https://github.com/rusq/slackdump/releases/">releases</a>
page. (If you're using <strong>macOS</strong>, download <strong>Darwin</strong> executable).</li>
<li>Unpack the archive to any directory.</li>
<li>Run the <code>./slackdump</code> or <code>slackdump.exe</code> executable (see note below).</li>
<li>You know the drill:  use arrow keys to select the menu item, and Enter (or
Return) to confirm.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">By default, Slackdump uses the EZ-Login 3000 automatic login, and interactive
mode.</p>
<div dir="auto">
<p dir="auto">Note</p>
<p dir="auto">On Windows and macOS you may be presented with "Unknown developer" window,
this is fine.  Reason for this is that the executable hasn't been signed by
the developer certificate.</p>
<p dir="auto">To work around this:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>on Windows</strong>: click "more information", and press "Run
Anyway" button.</li>
<li><strong>on macOS</strong>: open the folder in Finder, hold Option and double click the
executable, choose Run.</li>

<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/thayakawa-gh/SlackLogViewer/releases">SlackLogViewer</a> - a fast and powerful Slack Export viewer written in C++.</li>

<p dir="auto">Slackdump uses a simple <a href="https://github.com/rusq/dlog">rusq/dlog</a> as a default logger (it is a wrapper around
the standard logger that adds Debug* functions).</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to use the same default logger that Slackdump uses in your
application, it is available as <code>logger.Default</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">No doubts that everyone has their own favourite logger that is better than other
miserable loggers.  Please read below for instructions on plugging your
favourite logger.</p>

<p dir="auto">If you need to use some other logger, such as <a href="https://github.com/golang/glog">glog</a>, it is a matter of wrapping
the calls to satisfy the <code>logger.Interface</code> (defined in the <a href="https://github.com/rusq/slackdump/blob/master/logger/logger.go">logger</a>
package), and then setting the <code>Logger</code> variable in slackdump.Options (see
<a href="https://github.com/rusq/slackdump/blob/master/options.go">options.go</a>), or using WithLogger option.</p>

</tr>
<tr><th>A:</th><td>No, you don't.  Just run the application and EZ-Login 3000 will take
care of the authentication or, alternatively, grab that token and
cookie from the browser Slack session.  See <a href="https://github.com/rusq/slackdump/blob/master/doc/README.rst">User Guide</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr><th>Q:</th><td><strong>I'm getting "invalid_auth" error</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr><th>A:</th><td>Go get the new Cookie from the browser and Token as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr><th>Q:</th><td><strong>Slackdump takes a very long time to cache users</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr><th>A:</th><td>Disable the user cache with <code>-no-user-cache</code> flag.</td>
</tr>
<tr><th>Q:</th><td><strong>How to read the export file?</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr><th>A:</th><td>For Slack Workspace Export, use <a href="https://github.com/thayakawa-gh/SlackLogViewer/releases">SlackLogViewer</a> which is extremely fast
with an advanced search function, or <a href="https://github.com/hfaran/slack-export-viewer">slack export viewer</a> which is a
Python application and runs in a browser.  For the generic dump files, see
<a href="https://github.com/rusq/slackdump/blob/master/examples">examples</a> directory for some python and shell examples.</td>
</tr>
<tr><th>Q:</th><td><strong>My Slack Workspace is on the Free plan.  Can I get data older than
90-days?</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr><th>A:</th><td>No, unfortunately you can't.  Slack doesn't allow to export data older
than 90 days for free workspaces, the API does not return any data before 90
days for workspaces on the Free plan.</td>
