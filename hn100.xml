<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you live in Germany, you have been treated like livestock by Deutsche Bahn (DB). Almost all of my friends have a story: they traveled with DB, got thrown out in the middle of the night in some cow village, and had to wait hours for the next train.</p><p>I have something better. I was kidnapped.</p><hr><p>December 24th, 2024. 15:30. Cologne Main Station, Platform 9 D-G.</p><p>I am taking the RE5 (ID 28521) to my grandmother’s house in Meckenheim. Scheduled departure: 15:32. Scheduled arrival in Bonn: 15:54. From there, the S23 to Meckenheim. A journey of 35 kilometers, or, in DB units, somewhere between forty-five minutes and the heat death of the universe.</p><p>I wanted to arrive early to spend more time with her. My father, who lives near Troisdorf, was supposed to join us later.</p><p>I board the train. It is twenty minutes late. I consider this early. At least the train showed up. In DB’s official statistics, a train counts as “on time” if it’s less than six minutes late.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Cancelled trains are not counted at all.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> If a train doesn’t exist, it cannot be late.</p><p>The train starts moving. The driver announces there are “issues around Bonn.” He does not specify what kind. No one asks. We have learned not to ask. He suggests we exit at Cologne South and take the subway, or continue to Troisdorf and catch a bus from there.</p><p>I decide to continue to Troisdorf. My father can just pick me up there and we drive together. The plan adapts.</p><p>The driver announces the full detour: from Cologne South to Troisdorf to Neuwied to Koblenz. The entire left bank of the Rhine is unavailable. Only then I notice: the driver has been speaking German only. If you were a tourist who got on in Cologne to visit Brühl, thirteen minutes away, you were about to have a very confusing Christmas in Troisdorf.</p><p>A woman near me is holding chocolates and flowers. She is on the phone with her mother. “Sorry Mama, I’ll be late.” Pause. “Deutsche Bahn.” Pause. Her mother understood.</p><p>Twenty minutes later. We are approaching Troisdorf. I stand up. I gather my things. My father texts me: he is at the station, waiting.</p><p>The driver comes back on: “Hello everyone. Apparently we were not registered at Troisdorf station, so we are on the wrong tracks. We cannot stop.”</p><p>He says this the way someone might say “the coffee machine is broken.”</p><p>Silence. Laughter. Silence.</p><p>I watch Troisdorf slide past the window. Somewhere in the parking lot outside the station, my father is sitting in his car, watching his son pass by as livestock.</p><p>My father calls.</p><p>“The train couldn’t stop.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Next stop is Neuwied.”</p><p>“Neuwied?” Pause. “That’s in Rheinland-Pfalz.” Pause. “That’s a different <em>federal state</em>.”</p><p>“Yup.”</p><p>I was trying to travel 35 kilometers. I was now 63 kilometers from my grandmother’s house. Further away than when I started.</p><p>There are fifteen stations between Troisdorf and Neuwied. We pass all of them.</p><p>At some point you stop being a passenger and start being cargo. A cow transporter. Mooohhhhh. A cow transporter going to a cow village. (Germany has a word for this: Kuhdorf. The cows are metaphorical. Usually.) I reached this point around Oberkassel.</p><p>DB once operated a bus to Llucalcari, a Mallorcan village of seventeen people.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> I wanted to take it home.</p><p>An English speaker near the doors is getting agitated. “What is happening? Why didn’t we stop?”</p><p>“We are not registered for this track.”</p><p>“But where will we stop?”</p><p>“Neuwied. Fifty-five minutes.”</p><p>“Fifty-five minutes.” He said it again, quieter. “I am being kidnapped.”</p><p>My seatmate, who had not looked up from his book in forty minutes, turned a page. “Deutsche Bahn.”</p><hr><p>I looked up my compensation.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> 1.50 EUR. Minimum payout threshold: 4.00 EUR.</p><p>I had been kidnapped at a loss.</p><figure><img sizes="(min-width: 35em) 1200px, 100vw" srcset="https://www.theocharis.dev/blog/kidnapped-by-deutsche-bahn/neuwied-station_hu11707903120371504183.jpg 480w,

These are the moments where the work of Tor's anti-censorship team is more important than ever, to fulfill our mission of preserving connectivity between users in affected regions and the rest of the world.</p><p>In this blog post, we want to talk about what we've learned, how we've adapted, and what other internet users can do to keep Tor users connected.</p><h2>Iran</h2><p>In June, during the war between Iran and Israel, the censorship in <a href="https://filter.watch/english/2025/10/02/irans-stealth-blackout-a-multi-stakeholder-analysis-of-the-june-2025-internet-shutdown/">Iran intensified up to a point where internet was disconnected for few days</a>. Presumably to impede espionage-related communication while simultaneously consolidating political power.</p><h3>Monitoring the censorship landscape</h3><p>During this period, we were constantly monitoring the situation using our in-region vantage-point system. This vantage-point system is a network of monitoring locations inside Iran that provides more recent and accurate information about censorship than is available from public data.</p><p>One clear example is domain-fronting data. Domain-fronting is a technique that makes Tor traffic look like other popular, harder-to-block websites (like major cloud services). To determine which domain-fronting configurations perform best across the most locations, we deployed an automated testing tool that detects and reports the accessibility of the Snowflake broker and the Moat service for each domain-fronting configuration at each of our vantage points. This information is then aggregated by the log collector and subsequently used to monitor the domain-fronting configurations currently in use and to select the configurations to use in the future.</p><h3>Strengthening Snowflake</h3><p><a href="https://snowflake.torproject.org/">Snowflake</a> is the most used network traffic obfuscation tool in Iran. Over the past year we have been working on improving it to ensure that it remains strong and accessible to users.</p><p>We have upgraded the web extension to Manifest Version 3 (the latest browser extension standard), to be compatible with modern browsers. We improved the NAT checking logic which helps us figure out what kind of network setup each user has. This way, the proxies are more accurately assigned to the clients depending on their network capabilities. And  we enhanced the metrics reported by the standalone proxy, providing better tooling for proxy operators to assist what is happening with their proxies.</p><p>Under the hood we have created a staging server for Snowflake, so we have a robust infrastructure to stress test new features making sure they're fit for real deployment. This will help us bring big changes in the coming year to improve the efficiency of the protocol where networks are severely disrupted and to create better mechanisms to prevent censors from blocking Snowflake.</p><h3>Deploying Conjure</h3><p>Censorship agencies like those in Iran often attempt to block bridges by obtaining bridge information in bulk and then inputing the network address of these bridges to their censorship gateways to block them. That's why we developed Conjure.</p><p>Conjure is a pluggable transport designed to stay ahead of proxy-listing-based blocking by leveraging unused address space within cooperating ISP networks, thereby limiting the damage caused by blocking individual network addresses. Think of it like the act of generating temporary email addresses to avoid spam emails, by making sure the address is temporary and easy to regenerate, anything blocked at that address won't affect your ability to get new ones.</p><p>We are working on distributing Conjure in places with strong censorship. To make it hard for censors, we have improved Tor's implementation of Conjure by extending the protocols used both for bootstrapping the connection and transport the data. We added multiple registration methods (DNS and AMP-cache), making the bootstrap of the conjure connection more censorship-resistant and the connection will look as if the user is connecting to widely used service. We also integrated additional transports from upstream (DTLS and prefix) that makes the Tor traffic look like common protocols–meaning regular internet traffic.</p><h2>Russia</h2><p>Another region that has experienced many changes this year is Russia. With continued conflict and attrition, internet censorship has intensified, including increased allowlist-based censorship and address-block-based censorship.</p><p>Last year, we introduced WebTunnel as a new pluggable transport. We have seen this year how WebTunnel has become a key tool for users in Russia, thanks to its ability to blend into regular web traffic. As the severity of censorship in Russia has increased, WebTunnel has also received several fixes, such as SNI imitation and safe non-WebPKI certificate support with certificate-chain pinning to ensure it can withstand more kinds of censorship, including SNI allowlisting and the rapid blocking of distributed bridges.</p><p>Many of these improvements come from volunteers or are shaped by user feedback. Our community of users and supporters makes all this work possible and helps us stay ahead at Tor. Thanks to our Tor community team, we have first-hand insights into what works and what doesn't. This gives us access to the best information in the region. Additionally, through the community team's work with people on the ground, we receive support in testing and identifying the best technology for each censorship scenario.</p><h3>Experimenting with bridge distribution</h3><p>When we started distributing WebTunnel bridges in December they were a very useful tool to connect to Tor. They worked well for months, and Tor Browser users got them configured automatically over Connect Assist if they were located in Russia. However, in June, the Russian censors began listing most of our WebTunnel bridges, prompting us to shift strategies.</p><p>In recent history, our Telegram distributor has proven to be a useful tool in Russia, as the censor has a harder time extracting all the bridges from it. This is why we have now added support for WebTunnel in our Telegram distributor. We are always trying to meet our users where they are, and while Telegram might not be the safest place for your online communications, many users in Russia already uses it. And is not only useful for Russian users, but also for Iranian ones that are currently using webtunnel bridges distributed over Telegram.</p><p>All these fast changes of bridges distribution are possible thanks to <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/making-connections-from-bridgedb-to-rdsys/">rdsys</a>, Tor's new bridge distribution system that we introduced last year. This year we kept improving rdsys adding a staging server, so we can stress-test it in a similar environments to the ones used in production. For our censored users that means that by the time new and updated anticensorship features arrive, we have already been able to fix many stability issues.</p><h2>Where do we go from here?</h2><p>Supporting our users to continue fighting censorship is what our work is all about. Making it possible to connect to the Tor network on censored networks–whatever they are. Whether it is your university, your internet service provider, or your government trying to keep you from getting the information you are entitled to. Next year we'll start rolling out Conjure, keep improving WebTunnel,and prepare Snowflake for the next big censorship events.</p><p>You too can help us fight censorship today, by sharing your bandwidth and <a href="https://snowflake.torproject.org/">running your own Snowflake</a>. The easiest way is to install a snowflake plugin in your browser to help others access the Tor network. And if you have a website <a href="https://community.torproject.org/relay/setup/webtunnel/">consider running a webtunnel bridge</a>.</p></div>

<p dir="auto">Z80-μLM is a 'conversational AI' that generates short character-by-character sequences, with quantization-aware training (QAT) to run on a Z80 processor with 64kb of ram.</p>
<p dir="auto">The root behind this project was the question: how small can we go while still having personality, and can it be trained or fine-tuned easily? With easy self-hosted distribution?</p>
<p dir="auto">The answer is Yes! And a 40kb .com binary (including inference, weights &amp; a chat-style UI) running on a 4MHz processor from 1976.</p>
<p dir="auto">It won't pass the Turing test, but it might make you smile at the green screen.</p>

<p dir="auto">Includes tools for generating training data with LLMs (Ollama or Claude API) and balancing class distributions.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Trigram hash encoding</strong>: Input text is hashed into 128 buckets - typo-tolerant, word-order invariant</li>
<li><strong>2-bit weight quantization</strong>: Each weight is {-2, -1, 0, +1}, packed 4 per byte</li>
<li><strong>16-bit integer inference</strong>: All math uses Z80-native 16-bit signed arithmetic</li>
<li><strong>~40KB .COM file</strong>: Fits in CP/M's Transient Program Area (TPA)</li>
<li><strong>Autoregressive generation</strong>: Outputs text character-by-character</li>
<li><strong>No floating point</strong>: Everything is integer math with fixed-point scaling</li>
<li><strong>Interactive chat mode</strong>: Just run <code>CHAT</code> with no arguments</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Interaction Style</h2><a id="user-content-interaction-style" aria-label="Permalink: Interaction Style" href="#interaction-style"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The model doesn't understand you. But somehow, it <em>gets</em> you.</p>
<p dir="auto">Your input is hashed into 128 buckets via trigram encoding - an abstract "tag cloud" representation. The model responds to the <em>shape</em> of your input, not the exact words:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="&quot;hello there&quot;  →  [bucket 23: 64, bucket 87: 32, ...]
&quot;there hello&quot;  →  [bucket 23: 64, bucket 87: 32, ...]  (same!)
&quot;helo ther&quot;    →  [bucket 23: 32, bucket 87: 32, ...]  (similar - typo tolerant)"><pre><code>"hello there"  →  [bucket 23: 64, bucket 87: 32, ...]
"there hello"  →  [bucket 23: 64, bucket 87: 32, ...]  (same!)
"helo ther"    →  [bucket 23: 32, bucket 87: 32, ...]  (similar - typo tolerant)
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This is semantically powerful for short inputs, but there's a limit: longer or order-dependent sentences blur together as concepts compete for the same buckets. "Open the door and turn on the lights" will likely be too close to distringuish from "turn on the door and open the lights."</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Small Responses, Big Meaning</h3><a id="user-content-small-responses-big-meaning" aria-label="Permalink: Small Responses, Big Meaning" href="#small-responses-big-meaning"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">A 1-2 word response can convey surprising nuance:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>OK</code> - acknowledged, neutral</li>
<li><code>WHY?</code> - questioning your premise</li>
<li><code>R U?</code> - casting existential doubt</li>
<li><code>MAYBE</code> - genuine uncertainty</li>
<li><code>AM I?</code> - reflecting the question back</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This isn't necessarily a limitation - it's a different mode of interaction. The terse responses force you to infer meaning from context or ask probing direct yes/no questions to see if it understands or not (e.g. 'are you a bot', 'are you human', 'am i human' displays logically consistent memorized answers)</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What It's Good At</h3><a id="user-content-what-its-good-at" aria-label="Permalink: What It's Good At" href="#what-its-good-at"></a></p>

<li>Short, varied inputs with consistent categorized outputs</li>
<li>Fuzzy matching (typos, rephrasing, word order)</li>
<li>Personality through vocabulary choice</li>

<p dir="auto">The Z80 is an 8-bit CPU, but we use its 16-bit register pairs (HL, DE, BC) for activations and accumulators. Weights are packed 4-per-byte (2-bit each) and unpacked into 8-bit signed values for the multiply-accumulate.</p>
<p dir="auto">The 16-bit accumulator gives us numerical stability (summing 256 inputs without overflow), but the model's expressiveness is still bottlenecked by the 2-bit weights, and naive training may overflow or act 'weirdly' without QAT.</p>

<time datetime="2025-08-02">Aug 2, 2025</time>



(<a href="http://maurycyz.com/tags/programming">Programming</a>) 



<p>Instead of writing HTML like this:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="html"><span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span><span>=</span><span>cool-thing</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>Hello, World!
</span></span><span><span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>… you can write HTML like this:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="html"><span><span>&lt;<span>cool-thing</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>Hello, World!
</span></span><span><span>&lt;/<span>cool-thing</span>&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>… and CSS like this:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="css"><span><span><span>cool-thing</span> {
</span></span><span><span>	<span>display</span>: <span>block</span>;
</span></span><span><span>	<span>font-weight</span>: <span>bold</span>;
</span></span><span><span>	<span>text-align</span>: <span>center</span>;
</span></span><span><span>	<span>filter</span>: drop-shadow(<span>0</span> <span>0</span> <span>0.5</span><span>em</span> <span>#ff0</span>);
</span></span><span><span>	<span>color</span>: <span>#ff0</span>;
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div>
<cool-thing>
Hello, World!
</cool-thing>

<p>Browsers handle unrecognized tags by treating them as a generic element, with no effect beyond what’s specified in the CSS.
This isn’t just a weird quirk, but is <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#htmlunknownelement">standardized behavior</a>.
If you include hyphens in the name, you can guarantee that your tag won’t appear in any future versions of HTML.</p>
<p>While you should use descriptive built-in tags if they exist, if it’s a choice between &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt;,
making up your own tag provides better readability then using a bunch of class names.</p>
<p>As an example, if you have a bunch of nested tags:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="html"><span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span><span>=</span><span>article</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span><span>=</span><span>article-header</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span><span>=</span><span>article-quote</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span><span>=</span><span>quote-body</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>... a bunch more HTML ...
</span></span><span><span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Good luck trying to insert something inside of “article-heading” but after “article-quote” on the first try.
This problem vanishes if you use descriptive tag names — no &lt;/div&gt; counting required:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="html"><span><span>&lt;<span>main-article</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>&lt;<span>article-header</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>&lt;<span>article-quote</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>&lt;<span>quote-body</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>... a bunch more HTML ...
</span></span><span><span>&lt;/<span>quote-body</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>&lt;/<span>article-quote</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;!-- here! --&gt;</span>
</span></span><span><span>&lt;/<span>article-header</span>&gt;
</span></span><span><span>&lt;/<span>main-article</span>&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div>

<p dir="auto">Your creation of Clojure ...</p>

<p dir="auto">Ah, Christmas time. That time of year when our hearts are warmed by the best wishes of an idiot robot. All tingly from the experience, and in the holiday spirit, I thought I'd write my own letter of thanks to those bringing us this next generation of 'AI'.</p>

<p dir="auto">How shall I thank thee, let me count the ways:</p>
<p dir="auto">Should I thank you for pirating the entire historical output of creative humanity and then asserting ownership of your loot?</p>
<p dir="auto">For destroying education?</p>
<p dir="auto">For raising utility rates and killing the environment?</p>
<p dir="auto">For wasting vast quantities of developer time trying to coax some useful output from your BS generators, time which could instead be used communicating to interns and entry-level devs who, being actually intelligent, could learn from what they are told, and maintain what they make?</p>
<p dir="auto">For eliminating entry-level jobs, and thus the path to experience, ensuring future generations of unskilled, unemployable people?</p>
<p dir="auto">For giving me a fake person to talk to when I need support instead of an actual person who understands what I'm saying, can help me faster, and has a chance of caring?</p>
<p dir="auto">For replacing search results with summary BS?</p>
<p dir="auto">For providing the tools to fill the internet with slop, making actual human content almost impossible to find?</p>
<p dir="auto">For enticing CEOs with the promise to save some fraction of a percent on personnel costs, not actually be any faster, cutting off their future labor pool while only experiencing a modest to severe reduction in product quality, integrity and customer satisfaction (tradeoffs they are apparently eager to make)?</p>
<p dir="auto">For replacing musical expression with the sounds of robot parrots chirping?</p>
<p dir="auto">For adding an 'AI' feature to every flipping thing, most such features requiring a deep invasion of privacy?</p>
<p dir="auto">For running the second biggest and most damaging con of this century (running hard at first)?</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong><em>I think not.</em></strong></p>
<p dir="auto">This email was a reminder that agentic 'AI' is sure to flood the remainder of human communication channels with BS, swamping many services, and making every interaction with people not in the same room suspect, and filtering it a time-consuming waste, forever.</p>

                <p><em>On Wednesday 31 May, it was reported that Alex Mahon, CEO of Channel 4, could receive<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/may/31/channel-4-boss-alex-mahon-could-get-stations-biggest-ever-payday-of-14m" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> record annual pay of £1.4m</a>. This article was originally published on 26 April 2021 and asks, as Executive pay continues to rise, does a company need a CEO at all?</em></p>



<p>Over the next two weeks, the boards of <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/bae-systems-on-defensive-over-golden-handcuffs-deal-for-sought-after-ceo-12280257" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BAE Systems</a>, <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/looming-astrazeneca-pay-row-provides-latest-headache-for-ceo-soriot-12284677" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AstraZeneca</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/glencore-ceo-pay-idUSL1N2M90QZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Glencore</a>,  <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/flutter-entertainment-shareholder-revolt-chief-executive-pay-rise-hostelworld-v6j3khkx2" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Flutter Entertainment</a> and the <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/london-stock-exchange-faces-investor-backlash-over-chiefs-25-pay-rise-12262725" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">London Stock Exchange</a> all face the possibility of shareholder revolts over executive pay at their forthcoming annual general meetings (AGMs). As the AGM season begins, there is a particular focus on pay.</p>



<p>Executive pay is often the most contentious item at an AGM, but this year is clearly exceptional. The people running companies that have been severely impacted by <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/tag/covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Covid-19</a> can’t be blamed for the devastation of their revenues by the pandemic, but they also can’t take credit for the government stimulus that has kept them afloat. Last week, for example, nearly 40 per cent of shareholders in the estate agents Foxtons <a href="https://propertyindustryeye.com/last-weeks-foxtons-agm-must-serve-as-a-wake-up-call-for-the-board/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">voted against</a> its chief executive officer, Nicholas Budden, receiving a bonus of just under £1m; Foxtons has received about £7m in direct government assistance and is benefiting from the government’s <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/business/sectors/2021/04/who-benefits-when-government-pumps-housing-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continued inflation of the housing market</a>. The person who has done most to ensure Foxtons’ ongoing good fortune is not Nicholas Budden but <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/tag/rishi-sunak" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rishi Sunak</a>. </p>



<p>Under the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act, executive pay is voted on at least every three years, and this process forces shareholders and the public to confront how much the people at the top take home. Tim Steiner, the highest-paid CEO in the FTSE 100, was paid £58.7m in 2019 for running Ocado, which is <a href="https://www.cipd.co.uk/Images/ftse-100-executive-pay-report_tcm18-82375.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2,605 times the median income of his employees</a> for that year, while the average FTSE100 CEO makes more than £15,000 a day.  </p><section>

                        </section>



<p>As the High Pay Centre’s annual assessment of CEO pay points out, a top-heavy wage bill extends beyond the CEO, and could be unsustainable for any company this year. “When one considers high earners beyond the CEO”, says the report, ”there is actually quite significant potential for companies to safeguard jobs and incomes by asking higher-paid staff to make sacrifices”.</p>



<p>In the longer term, as companies commit to greater automation of many roles, it’s pertinent to ask whether a company needs a CEO at all.  </p>



<p>A few weeks ago Christine Carrillo, an American tech CEO, raised this question herself when she tweeted a spectacularly tone-deaf appreciation of her executive assistant, whose work allows Carrillo to “write [and] surf every day” as well as “cook dinner and read every night”. In Carrillo’s unusually frank description of the work her EA does – most of her emails, most of the work on fundraising, playbooks, operations, recruitment, research, updating investors, invoicing “and so much more” – she guessed that this unnamed worker “saves me 60% of time”.</p>



<p>Predictably, a horde arrived to point out that if someone else is doing 60 per cent of Carrillo’s job, they should be paid 50 per cent more than her. But as Carrillo – with a frankly breathtaking lack of self-awareness – informed another commenter, her EA is based in the Philippines. The main (and often the only) reason to outsource a role is to pay less for it.</p>



<p><strong><em>[See also: <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/new-statesman-view/2023/05/the-scourge-of-greedflation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The scourge of greedflation</a>]</em></strong></p>



<p>If most of a CEO’s job can be outsourced, this suggests it could also be automated. But while <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/business/companies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">companies</a> are racing to automate entry- and mid-level roles, senior executives and decision makers show much less interest in automating themselves.</p>



<p>There’s a good argument for automating from the top rather than from the bottom. As we know from the annotated copy of <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em> that sits (I assume) on every CEO’s Isamu Noguchi nightstand, human decision-making is the product of irrational biases and assumptions. This is one of the reasons strategy is so difficult, and roles that involve strategic decision-making are so well paid. But the difficulty of making genuinely rational strategic decisions, and the cost of the people who do so, are also good reasons to hand this work over to software.</p>



<p>Automating jobs can be risky, especially in public-facing roles. After Microsoft sacked a large team of journalists in 2020 in order to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/30/21275524/microsoft-news-msn-layoffs-artificial-intelligence-ai-replacements" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">replace them with AI</a>, it almost immediately had to contend with the <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/tech/microsoft-robot-ai-editors-jade-thirwall-little-mix-a4463706.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PR disaster</a> of the software’s failure to distinguish between two women of colour. Amazon had to abandon its AI recruitment tool after it <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight-idUSKCN1MK08G" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">learned to discriminate against women</a>. And when GPT-3, one of the most advanced AI language models, was used as a medical chatbot in 2020, it responded to a (simulated) patient presenting with suicidal ideation by <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/10/28/gpt3_medical_chatbot_experiment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">telling them to kill themselves</a>.</p>



<p>What links these examples is that they were all attempts to automate the kind of work that happens without being scrutinised by lots of other people in a company. Top-level strategic decisions are different. They are usually debated before they’re put into practice – unless, and this is just another reason to automate them, employees feel they can’t speak up for fear of incurring the CEO’s displeasure.</p>



<p>Where automated management – or “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/journey-to-ai/2020/04/the-rise-of-decision-intelligence-ai-that-optimizes-decision-making/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">decision intelligence</a>”, as Google and IBM call it – has been deployed, it’s produced impressive results. Hong Kong’s mass transit system put software in charge of scheduling its maintenance <a href="https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~hwchun/AIProjects/stories/allocation/mtrcscheduling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">in 2004</a>, and enjoys a reputation as one of the world’s most punctual and best-run metros.   </p>



<p>Clearly, chief execs didn’t get where they are today by volunteering to clear out their corner offices and hand over their caviar spittoons to robots. But management is a very large variable cost that only seems to increase – Persimmon’s <a href="https://www.verdict.co.uk/persimmons-chief-executive-bonus-comparison/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">bonus scheme</a> paid out half a billion pounds to 150 execs in a single year – while technology moves in the other direction, becoming cheaper and more reliable over time.</p>



<p>It is often asked whether CEO pay is fair or ethical. But company owners and investors should be asking if their top management could be done well by a machine – and if so, why is it so expensive?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Milk production at a dairy farm was low, so the farmer wrote to the local university, asking for help from academia.
A multidisciplinary team of professors was assembled, headed by a theoretical physicist, and two weeks of intensive on-site investigation took place.
The scholars then returned to the university, notebooks crammed with data, where the task of writing the report was left to the team leader.
Shortly thereafter the physicist returned to the farm, saying to the farmer, "I have the solution, but it works only in the case of spherical cows in a vacuum".</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Turn on the tap, and water flows without a second thought. But deep beneath New York City, hundreds of feet below street level, workers are finishing a project that’s been under construction for more than half a century — a massive water tunnel that will help keep that simple act possible for generations to come.</p>
<p>Tunnel No. 3, as it’s known, is one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects in the city’s history.</p>
<p>When complete, it will ensure New Yorkers continue to receive clean water from upstate reservoirs — some more than 125 miles away — while allowing long-overdue maintenance on the city’s two older tunnels, built in 1917 and 1936.</p>
<div><hr>

<h4><b>What You Need To Know</b></h4>
<h5><ul>
<li>About 95% of New York City’s water supply flows into the city by gravity through three water tunnels</li>
<br>
<li>Tunnels 1 and 2 were completed in 1917 and 1936, respectively</li>
<br>
<li>Construction on Tunnel 3 began in 1970 and currently serves the Bronx and Manhattan</li>
<br>
<li>The final two shafts in Queens are expected to be completed by 2032, allowing for long-term repairs to the city’s aging water infrastructure</li>
</ul>
</h5>
<hr>

</div>
<p>City Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Rohit Aggarwala and DEP Portfolio Manager Lauren D’Attile recently took an elevator nearly 800 feet down to see the progress for themselves.</p>
<p>“It’s not quite as far down as the Empire State Building is tall, but it’s getting there,” Aggarwala said during the 10-minute descent.</p>
<p>Down below, flashlights cut through the darkness as water dripped from the rock walls. Workers stood in waterproof boots along the cool, damp concrete — the result of decades of digging, drilling and sealing off bare rock to create a watertight tunnel system.</p>
<p>“When this tunnel was originally constructed, it was built by a tunnel boring machine, which is a very large piece of equipment with cutter heads on the front,” said D’Attile. “We drill the tunnel and after that we line that bare rock with a couple of feet of concrete — so that’s what you’re seeing now, because this tunnel is complete.”</p>
<p>Construction on Tunnel No. 3 began in 1970.</p>
<p>The Bronx and Manhattan already receive water from it, and the final phase — extending service to Brooklyn and Queens — is expected to be completed by 2032.</p>
<p>“The project started in 1970, it will be finished in 2032 — that’s 62 years to build this thing,” Aggarwala said. “But a project like this is going to serve New York for two, three hundred years, who knows how much longer than that. Seems worth it. Totally worth it. It’s what makes the city work because we are constantly investing in our future.”</p>
<p>When it’s complete, the DEP will finally be able to take the older tunnels offline for repairs — a step city engineers have waited decades to take.</p>
<p>Above ground, New Yorkers will keep turning on their faucets, washing dishes, and filling glasses — rarely thinking about the billion gallons of water flowing through the underground arteries that make city life possible.</p>

   <p>The world has a memory problem, thanks to artificial intelligence.</p>   <p>The explosion in AI-related cloud computing and data centers has led to so much demand for certain types of memory chips that now there's a shortage. The imbalance is expected to start affecting prices of all sorts of products powered by technology.</p>   <p>"I keep telling everybody that if you want a device, you buy it now," said Avril Wu, a senior research vice president at TrendForce, a Taiwan-based consultancy that tracks markets for computer components. "I myself bought an iPhone 17 already,"</p>   <p>The chips are known as RAM, or random access memory, and are crucial to making sure that things like smartphones, computers and game consoles run smoothly. Chips allow you to keep multiple tabs open in browsers, for instance, or watch videos without them being choppy.</p>   
   
   
<!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5656190-100" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Wu said TrendForce's data indicates that demand for RAM chips exceeds supply by 10% – and it's growing so fast that manufacturers are having to shell out a lot more to buy them each month.</p>   <p>Wu said this quarter alone, they're paying 50% more than the previous quarter for the most common type of RAM, known as DRAM – dynamic random access memory. And if producers want the chips sooner, they're paying two to three times more.</p>   <p>Wu expects DRAM prices to rise another 40% in the coming quarter, and she doesn't expect the prices to go down in 2026.</p>   <h3>How AI is gobbling up memory</h3>   <p>AI data centers require huge amounts of memory to accompany their cutting-edge graphics processing unit (GPU) microprocessors that train and operate AI models.</p>   <p>"AI workloads are built around memory," said Sanchit Vir Gogia, CEO of the tech advisory firm Greyhound Research.</p>   <p>What's more, AI companies are spending billions of dollars constructing data centers at warp speed around the world. It's the reason why Gogia says the demand for these chips isn't just a cyclical blip.</p>   <p>"AI has changed the nature of demand itself," he said. "Training and inference systems require large, persistent memory footprints, extreme bandwidth, and tight proximity to compute. You cannot dial this down without breaking performance."</p>   
   <h3>More chips for AI means fewer&nbsp; chips for other products</h3>   <p>Idaho-based Micron Technology is one of the world's top makers of RAM and it's benefited from this increase in demand. It reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings last week on the back of higher memory chip prices.</p>   <p>CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said the company expected the market to remain strong, as the AI boom continues apace. "We believe that the aggregate industry supply will remain substantially short of the demand for the foreseeable future," he said on a webcast after the earnings report.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5656190-101" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Chipmakers like Micron have <a href="https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-announces-exit-crucial-consumer-business" target="_blank"><u>shifted production</u></a> to meet as much of the lucrative AI-related demand for high-end memory as they can, according to analysts. That translates into fewer chips for other segments of the market – personal computers, mobile phones, games and consumer products like TVs.</p>   <p>And that means higher costs. Dell Technologies Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke noted the higher costs on an <a href="https://investors.delltechnologies.com/static-files/9d07092c-7a61-42be-a1c2-54aea7465d17" target="_blank"><u>earnings call</u></a> on Nov. 25. For PC's, he said "I don't see how this will certainly not make its way into the customer base."</p>   <p>Analysts say there is no short-term fix.</p>   <p>Tech consultant Wu said the memory chip industry faces a significant bottleneck. By the end of 2026, she said, chip makers will have maxed out how much they can expand production in their current facilities.</p>   <p>She said the next new factory expected to come online is being built by Micron in Idaho. The company says it will be operational in 2027.</p>   <p>Expect suppliers to keep raising prices for the foreseeable future, Wu said.</p>

<time datetime="2025-12-27">Dec 27, 2025</time>



(<a href="http://maurycyz.com/tags/photography">Photography</a>) 



<p>Here’s a photo of a Christmas tree, as my camera’s sensor sees it:</p>
<p><img src="https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/xmas1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<center>Sensor data with the 14 bit ADC values mapped to 0-255 RGB.</center>
<!-- Black point compensation --> 
<p>It’s not even black-and-white, it’s gray-and-gray.
This is becuase while the ADC’s output can theoretically go from 0 to 16382, the actual data doesn’t cover that whole range:</p>
<p><img src="https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/hist1.png" alt=""></p>
<center>Histogram of raw image</center>
<p>The real range of ADC values is ~2110 to ~136000.
Let’s set those values as the white and black in the image:</p>
<p><strong>V<sub>new</sub> = (V<sub>old</sub> - Black)/(White - Black)</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/xmas2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<center>Progress</center>
<p>Much better, but it’s still more monochromatic then I remember the tree being.
Camera sensors aren’t actually able to see color: They only measure how much light hit each pixel.</p>
<p>In a color camera, the sensor is covered by a grid of alternating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_filter">color filters</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/xmas3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Let’s color each pixel the same as the filter it’s looking through:</p>
<p><img src="https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/xmas4.png" alt=""></p>
<center>Bayer matrix overlay</center>
<p>This version is  more colorful, but each pixel only has one third of it’s RGB color.
To fix this, I just averaged the values each pixel with it’s neighbors:</p>
<p><img src="https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/xmas5.png" alt=""></p>
<center>Demosaicing results</center>
<p>Applying this process to the whole photo gives the lights some color:</p>
<p><img src="https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/xmas6.jpg" alt=""></p>
<center>Demosaiced tree</center>
<p>However, the image is still very dark.
This is because monitors don’t have as much dynamic range as the human eye, or a camera sensor:
Even if you are using an OLED, the screen still has some ambient light reflecting off of it and limiting how black it can get.</p>
<p>There’s also another, sneaker factor causing this:</p>
<p><img src="https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/lin.png" alt=""></p>
<center>True linear gradient</center>
<p>Our perception of brightness is non-linear.</p>
<p>If brightness values are quantized, most of the ADC bins will be wasted on nearly identical shades of white while every other tone is crammed into the bottom.
Because this is an inefficient use of memory, most color spaces assign extra bins to darker colors:</p>
<p><img src="https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/nonlin.png" alt=""></p>
<center>sRGB gradient</center>
<p>As a result of this, if the linear data is displayed directly, it will appear much darker then it should be.</p>
<p>Both problems can be solved by applying a non-linear curve to each color channel to brighten up the dark areas… but this doesn’t quite work out:</p>
<p><img src="https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/xmas7.jpg" alt=""></p>
<center>ohno</center>
<p>Some of this green cast is caused by the camera sensor being intrinsically more sensitive to green light, but some of it is my fault:
There are twice as many green pixels in the filter matrix.
When combined with my rather naive demosaicing, this resulted in the green channel being boosted even higher.</p>
<p>In either case, it can fixed with proper white-balance:
Equalize the channels by multiply each one with a constant.</p>
<p>However, because the image is now non-linear, I have to go back a step to do this.
Here’s the dark image from before with all the values temporarily scaled up so I can see the problem:</p>
<p><img src="https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/xmas8.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>… here’s that image with the green taken down to mach the other channels:</p>
<p><img src="https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/xmas9.jpg" alt=""></p>
<center>Banishing the green</center>
<p>… and after re-applying the curve:</p>
<p><img src="https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/xmas10.jpg" alt=""></p>
<center>Finally: A decent photo.</center>
<p>This is really just the bare minimum:
I haven’t done any color calibration, the white balance isn’t perfect, there’s lots of noise that needs to be cleaned up…</p>
<p>Additionally, applying the curve to each color channel accidentally desaturated the highlights.
This effect looks rather good — and is what we’ve come to expect from film — but it’s has de-yellowed the star.
It’s possible to separate the luminance and curve it while preserving color.
On it’s own, this would make the LED Christmas lights into an overstaturated mess, but combining both methods can produce nice results.</p>
<p>For comparison, here’s the image my camera produced from the same data:</p>
<p><img src="https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/xmas0.jpg" alt=""></p>
<center>"in camera" JPEG image.</center>
<p>Far from being an “unedited” photo: there’s a huge amount of math that’s gone into making an image that nicely represents what the subject looks like in person.</p>
<p>There’s nothing that happens when you adjust the contrast or white balance in editing software that the camera hasn’t done under the hood.
The edited image isn’t “faker” then the original: they are different renditions of the same data.</p>
<p>In the end, replicating human perception is hard, and it’s made harder when constrained to the limitations of display technology or printed images.
There’s nothing wrong with tweaking the image when the automated algorithms make the wrong call.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main tabindex="-1" id="page-container"><article><header><figure></figure></header><div><div><div><p>Yale School of Medicine (YSM) scientists have discovered a molecular difference in the brains of autistic people compared to their neurotypical counterparts. </p> <p>Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition associated with behavioral differences including difficulties with social interaction, restrictive or intense interests, and repetitive movements or speech. But it’s not clear what makes autistic brains different. </p> <p>Now, a new study in <a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.20241084?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed" data-link-type="external" target="_blank"><em>The American Journal of Psychiatry</em></a> has found that brains of autistic people have fewer of a specific kind of receptor for glutamate, the most common excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. The reduced availability of these receptors may be associated with various characteristics linked to autism.</p> <p>“We have found this really important, never-before-understood difference in autism that is meaningful, has implications for intervention, and can help us understand autism in a more concrete way than we ever have before,” says <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/james-mcpartland/" data-link-type="external" target="_blank">James McPartland, PhD</a>, Harris Professor of Child Psychiatry and Psychology in the Child Study Center at YSM and the study’s co-principal investigator. </p></div><section><h2>Signaling imbalance in autism</h2><div><p>Neurons in the brain communicate with one another using electrical signals and chemical messengers called neurotransmitters. When an electrical current propagates through a neuron, it prompts the release of neurotransmitters that relay a signal to other neurons. This signaling in the brain can be either excitatory or inhibitory. Excitatory signaling primarily triggers the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate, and it acts as a green light telling other neurons to fire. Inhibitory signaling, on the other hand, acts as a brake that suppresses activity. </p> <p>The brain needs a precise balance of these two types of signaling in order to function properly. One of the leading hypotheses on the underlying causes of autism is an imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory signaling in the brain. Researchers propose the involvement of this central mechanism might explain the wide range of differences observed among autistic individuals.<br></p></div></section><blockquote><p>Now, we’ve found something that is meaningful,  measurable, and different in the autistic brain.</p><a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/james-mcpartland/" aria-label="James McPartland, PhD"><div><p><span>James McPartland, PhD</span></p><p>Harris Professor in the Child Study Center</p></div></a></blockquote><div><p>Based on this hypothesis, the researchers used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) to look for differences in the brains of 16 autistic adults and 16 people considered neurotypical. MRI scans enabled the researchers to examine the anatomy of each of the participants’ brains, while PET scans revealed how the brains were functioning at the molecular level.</p> <p>“PET scans can help us pinpoint a molecular map of what’s going on in this glutamate system,” says <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/david-matuskey/" data-link-type="external" target="_blank">David Matuskey, MD</a>, associate professor of radiology and biomedical imaging at YSM, and co-principal investigator of the study.</p></div><section><h2>Autistic brains have reduced availability of a crucial receptor</h2><div><p>These analyses revealed less brain-wide availability of a specific kind of glutamate receptor, known as metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) in autistic participants. The findings support the idea that an imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory signals in the brain could be contributing to traits associated with autism, the researchers say.<br></p> <p>Fifteen of the autistic participants also underwent an electroencephalogram (EEG), a measure of electrical activity of the brain. Based on the EEG, the researchers identified that these electrical measurements were associated with lower mGlu5 receptors.</p> <p>This finding could have significant clinical implications, the researchers say. While PET scans are a powerful tool for studying the brain, they are also costly and involve exposure to radiation. EEG could be a cheaper and more accessible way to further investigate excitatory function in the brain.</p> <p>“EEG isn’t going to completely replace PET scans, but it might help us understand how these glutamate receptors might be contributing to the ongoing brain activity in a person,” says <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/adam-naples/" data-link-type="external" target="_blank">Adam Naples, PhD</a>, assistant professor in the Child Study Center at YSM and the study’s first author.</p></div></section><blockquote><p>While many neurodivergent people aren’t hindered by autism  and may not need or want medication, novel treatments could help those on the  spectrum that experience symptoms that affect their quality of life.</p></blockquote><div><p>The study gives the researchers novel mechanistic insight into how the brains of autistic individuals are different from those of neurotypical people. Because the molecular underpinnings of autism are still so poorly understood, clinicians today rely on behavioral observation to diagnose it. Elucidating the “molecular backbone” of autism, researchers say, could potentially lead to better diagnostic tools and ways to support autistic people. </p> <p>“Today, I go into a room and play with a child to diagnose autism,” says McPartland, “Now, we’ve found something that is meaningful, measurable, and different in the autistic brain.”</p> <p>There are currently no medications that treat the difficulties experienced by many with autism. The findings could also help researchers come up with therapeutics for autism that target the mGlu5 receptor. While many neurodivergent people aren’t hindered by autism and may not need or want medication, novel treatments could help those on the spectrum that experience symptoms that affect their quality of life. </p></div><section><h2>Future research directions</h2><div><p>The current study only included autistic adults. It is still unclear whether the lower receptor availability is a driver of autism or a result of living with it for decades. Previously, research involving PET scans has been limited to adults due to the risks associated with radiation exposure. But Matuskey, co-investigator <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/richard-carson/" data-link-type="external" target="_blank">Richard Carson, PhD</a>, and their colleagues have developed <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/powerful-new-brain-pet-scanner-is-opening-new-research-pathways/" data-link-type="external" target="_blank">more sophisticated techniques</a> that open a pathway for much lower exposure to radiation. </p> <p>In future studies, the team plans to conduct research with these new technologies in children and adolescents. “We want to start creating a developmental story and start understanding whether the things that we’re seeing are the root of autism or a neurological consequence of having had autism your whole life,” says McPartland. </p> <p>All autistic participants in the study had average or above average cognitive abilities. McPartland and collaborators are also working together on developing other approaches to PET scans that will enable them to include individuals with intellectual disabilities in future studies.</p></div></section></div><section><h2>Article outro</h2><div><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false"><path d="M12.712 16.386 9 16.916l.53-3.716 9.546-9.546a2.25 2.25 0 1 1 3.182 3.186Z" style="fill:none;stroke:currentColor;stroke-linecap:round;stroke-linejoin:round;stroke-width:1.5px"></path><path d="M5.25 15h-3a1.5 1.5 0 0 0-1.5 1.5v3a1.5 1.5 0 0 0 1.5 1.5h19.5a1.5 1.5 0 0 0 1.5-1.5v-3a1.5 1.5 0 0 0-1.5-1.5h-3" style="fill:none;stroke:currentColor;stroke-linecap:round;stroke-linejoin:round;stroke-width:1.5px"></path></svg><h3>Author</h3></p></div><section><h3>Tags</h3><ul><li><a>Autism</a></li></ul></section><section><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" focusable="false"><rect width="22.5" height="15" x="0.747" y="2.25" rx="1.5" ry="1.5" style="fill:none;stroke:currentColor;stroke-linecap:round;stroke-linejoin:round;stroke-width:1.5px"></rect><path d="M19.5 20.856a9.6 9.6 0 0 0-15 0" style="fill:none;stroke:currentColor;stroke-linecap:round;stroke-linejoin:round;stroke-width:1.5px"></path></svg><h3>Media Contact</h3></p><p>For media inquiries, please contact us.</p></section></section><div><section id="explore-more-section-undefined" aria-label="Explore More"><div><h2 id="explore-more">Explore More</h2></div><div><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20" focusable="false"><g fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" clip-path="url(#people-avatar_svg__a)"><path d="M.416 10a9.583 9.583 0 1 0 19.166 0A9.583 9.583 0 0 0 .416 10"></path><path d="M3.299 16.85a21.3 21.3 0 0 1 4.51-1.96c.698-.258.774-1.857.274-2.408-.722-.794-1.333-1.724-1.333-3.971A3.177 3.177 0 0 1 10 5.038a3.177 3.177 0 0 1 3.25 3.473c0 2.25-.612 3.177-1.334 3.972-.5.55-.424 2.15.274 2.407a21.3 21.3 0 0 1 4.51 1.96"></path></g><defs><clipPath id="people-avatar_svg__a"><path fill="#fff" d="M0 0h20v20H0z"></path></clipPath></defs></svg><h3>Featured in this article</h3></p></div></section><div><h2 id="related-news">Related News</h2></div></div></div></article></main></div></div>]]></description>

<p>With the holiday season reaching its apex, we have a few surprises for those of you that have been patiently waiting.  The latest release of Dolphin is stuffed with treats.  Our first present is presentation - <em>frame presentation</em>, that is.  Two new options have arrived and will help users both reduce latency and smooth out games that struggle with frame pacing.</p>
<p>Some games do outright naughty things that make emulation difficult.  A slew of them are being coerced onto the nice list this year thanks to a sack full of patches that bypass their troublesome behaviors.  Fans of the Broadband Adapter (BBA) have a great present tailored just to them: a new local mode BBA!  Designed for allowing multiple instances of Dolphin on the same computer to connect together, it's perfect for use with Parsec or other similar services.  And perhaps another gift will have you singing your favorite Wii hits?</p>
<p>But alas, what fun would the holiday season be if we spoiled all the gifts?  Read on to unwrap the latest edition of the Dolphin Progress Report.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Huh?  We've received word that apparently the <em>Android users</em> have made the nice list?  Really?  That can't be right... but this gift is addressed to them.</p>


<p>After <em>more than a couple</em> bumps in the road, RetroAchievements support has finally arrived on the Android version of Dolphin!  In Release 2512, the core achievement experience is now available in your pocket.  This initial version hasn't quite reached parity yet with the desktop experience, but we didn't want to hold things up any longer.  The important thing for Android RetroAchievements users is that you can log in and unlock achievements in <a href="https://retroachievements.org/system/16-gamecube/games">supported GameCube games</a>. Because some menus are incomplete, it may be best to have the <a href="https://retroachievements.org/">RetroAchievements website</a> open in the background for achievement lists and other things while we finish up the in-app UI.</p>

<h3 id="notable-changes"><strong>Notable Changes</strong><a href="#notable-changes" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<h4 id="2509-493-add-rush-frame-presentation-and-smooth-frame-presentation-options-by-billiard"><strong><a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/download/dev/master/2509-493/">2509-493 - Add Rush Frame Presentation and Smooth Frame Presentation Options</a></strong>  by <strong><a href="https://github.com/jordan-woyak">Billiard</a></strong><a href="#2509-493-add-rush-frame-presentation-and-smooth-frame-presentation-options-by-billiard" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>Latency was once a huge challenge for emulators, and it is still a major concern.  At one point not too long ago, it was pretty much infeasible for most emulators to match the latency of their console counterparts.  Compared to a dedicated game console racing the beam on a CRT television, emulators had to deal with sluggish OS window managers with on-by-default triple-buffer V-Sync holding three frames back, first-gen wireless controllers that added latency right at the source of input, slower displays that added several <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/digitalfoundry-tech-focus-battle-against-latency">additional frames of latency</a> (much more if that display was a TV without game mode), and on top of everything the emulator still needed to do its job and take time to actually emulate everything.</p>
<p>Dolphin <em>just</em> missed out on the worst of this. By the time Dolphin's performance and compatibility were good enough for users to worry about things like latency, the overall situation had improved dramatically.  Low latency and high refresh rate monitors paired with features like <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2014/07/31/dolphin-progress-report-july-2014/#40-2286-d3d-exclusive-fullscreen-by-armada651">Exclusive Fullscreen</a> removed most of the major bottlenecks that emulators had to fight against.</p>
<p>The designs of the GameCube and Wii <em>also</em> afford Dolphin some opportunities that other emulators don't have.  The GameCube/Wii are double buffer V-Sync'd by default, resulting in a final input latency of roughly 60ms on a CRT in an optimized 60fps title.  However, because of <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2017/11/19/hybridxfb/">how the XFB Output Pipeline works</a>, Dolphin has the opportunity to bypass the buffers and grab those XFB copies early, and immediately present them directly to the screen. We call this feature <em>Immediately Present XFB</em>, and it cuts out quite a bit of the latency present on the console.</p>
<p>Tricks like these let Dolphin match console latency as long as the host device is capable enough.  On extremely optimal setups with low latency VRR monitors combined with <em>Immediately Present XFB</em>, Dolphin could even dip a frame <em>below</em> real console latency!</p>
<p>There are some caveats, though.  While <em>Immediately Present XFB</em> is a powerful tool for reducing latency, it is also a hack that relies on games behaving in a specific manner.  If a game messes with the XFB pipeline, such as if it applies post processing using the CPU, or stitches together multiple XFB Copies, the hack will cause Dolphin to output nonsensical garbage.</p>




<p>Even when <em>Immediate</em> isn't outright breaking the game, the XFB pipeline is a big part of how some games handle frame pacing, so bypassing it can make the game feel less smooth.  For the best experience in many games, a user probably would prefer superior latency <em>and</em> good frame pacing.</p>


<p>And that was <strong><a href="https://github.com/jordan-woyak">Billiard's</a></strong> goal.  He saw an opportunity to improve the situation and started work on two new options.  One feature was a way to reduce latency without disrupting how the game rendered, and the other would allow smoother frame pacing even in games that struggled on real console.  How would he accomplish these feats?  Well, by making the emulator throttle <em>smarter</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Modern computers are powerful enough to emulate <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Star_Wars_Rogue_Squadron_III:_Rebel_Strike"><em>most</em></a> GameCube and Wii games faster than the original hardware could run them. Disable the framelimiter and try it for yourself! To keep emulation on pace, Dolphin’s <em>Throttle</em> function stalls emulation to produce a <em>mostly</em> properly paced simulation of the original hardware. Throttling is necessary for playable emulation on modern systems, but making the host CPU wait <em>adds time</em>. If input from the user and stalls are aligned poorly, throttling can add a small amount of latency.</p>
<p>To address this, Billiard has added a new throttling mode called <em>Rush Frame Presentation</em>, where throttling becomes centered around presenting the frame as soon as it can after the input is read. In theory, this reduces the time between click and photon and can have a very noticeable effect, especially in lower frame rate titles.  To the end user, all of this is completely invisible.  All of this is happening <em>sub-frame</em>, so Dolphin still will throttle the appropriate amount of time to maintain the correct frame rate.</p>
<p>The faster your computer, the more of an effect this will have because it will be able to emulate the part of the frame faster.  We can easily catch the difference in <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=The_Legend_of_Zelda:_The_Wind_Waker">The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker</a> and <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Super_Mario_Sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a> by using a high speed camera, for example.</p>

<figcaption>Here we can visually see the reduced latency that Rush provides. This is somewhere between 8 - 14ms.<br><sub>Click/tap to Play.</sub></figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

<p>Some games will also see a <em>further</em> benefit by combining <em>Immediately Present XFB</em> with <em>Rush Frame Presentation</em>.  Unfortunately, this combination can lead certain games to looking gnarly as they will just be spitting out the image at whatever point they're finished rendering during a frame.  That's why the second new option is important.</p>
<h5 id="smoothing-things-out"><strong>Smoothing Things Out</strong><a href="#smoothing-things-out" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h5>
<p><em>Immediately Present XFB</em> could already cause poor frame pacing, and now <em>Rush Frame Presentation</em> could make it even worse.  In some games, it can get so poor that VRR monitors will fall out of their operating range!</p>
<p><em>Smooth Frame Presentation</em> allows Dolphin to delay presentation by roughly 1-2ms so that it can more consistently output frames, using previous frame times as a heuristic.  This option can be used in any game that has poor frame pacing in order to try to improve the situation.</p>


<p>The results of <em>Smooth Frame Presentation</em> are good enough that a lot of games that needed the XFB Output Pipeline enabled by default because of frame pacing issues can now take advantage of the lower input latency provided by <em>Immediately Present XFB</em> and <em>Rush Frame Presentation</em> without any noticeable side-effects.</p>
<p>Even if you're using neither of the latency features, some games just have bad frame pacing even on real console.  <em>Smooth Frame Presentation</em> can help them, too.  There are rare cases, especially when using <em>Rush Frame Presentation</em> alongside <em>Immediately Present XFB</em>, where a game's output will be so inconsistent that smoothing won't help.  We're looking at you, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Dragon_Ball_Z:_Budokai">Dragon Ball Z: Budokai</a>.</p>


<h5 id="outside-verification"><strong>Outside Verification</strong><a href="#outside-verification" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h5>
<p>All of these results sound great, but outside of a few camera tests on lower frame rate games, we were mostly trusting latency offset numbers <em>provided by Dolphin</em>.  Testers did also report better latency, but given that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo">placebo effect</a> exists and these are such small differences, we wanted more concrete data.  But other than just <em>game feel</em>, how do you test latency?</p>
<p>In the past, we've used the light sensor present on <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Rock_Band_3">Rock Band 3</a> guitars alongside an in-game synchronization test to get some very rough offset values.  The problem with that is that it will only ever test one game, and the guitar controller isn't particularly viable in most games outside of unusual controller runs.</p>
<p>Before making any claims about our latency, we wanted to do our due dilligence in respect to both Dolphin and real hardware.  To accomplish this, we contacted some professionals that have been fighting against latency for quite some time.  <strong><a href="https://github.com/JLaferri">Fizzi</a></strong> from <a href="https://slippi.gg/">Slippi.gg</a>  and adapter expert <strong><a href="https://github.com/JulienBernard3383279">Arte</a></strong> graciously donated their time and helped us measure latency in the latest version of Dolphin versus console.   <strong><a href="https://github.com/JulienBernard3383279">Arte</a></strong> <a href="https://www.input-integrity.com/">specifically developed a GameCube controller adapter with a photon sensor</a> designed to determine controller latency, which is rather convenient because <em>that's exactly what we want to measure</em>.</p>
<p>Their GameCube controller adapter polls the controller at 1000Hz, and a light sensor on it can be programmed to look for certain changes in output from the game.  By having access to both the source of the input and the change on the screen, the adapter can provide a real world measurement of how exactly how long it takes for a user input to result in a change on the display - what is commonly referred to as "click to photon".  As an added bonus, the adapter can also be hooked up to real console with no conversion or added latency, letting us compare directly with games running on real hardware and a CRT.</p>

<p>The exciting thing about these numbers is that they confirm our experience.  Dolphin's latency compares favorably to console.  To be fair to the GameCube, <strong><a href="https://github.com/JulienBernard3383279">Arte</a></strong>'s emulation setup included a modern low-latency 144Hz monitor and the lowest latency controller adapter.   Dolphin couldn't quite compete with Slippi, but most of that can be attributed to deep modifications to how <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Super_Smash_Bros._Melee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a> outputs.</p>
<p>For all the samples above, an input bug present in the original game has been patched out.  This is to make getting consistent results a little bit easier.  That fix did mean that combining <em>Rush Frame Presentation</em> and <em>Immediately Present XFB</em> no longer benefited that title when testing.  However, <strong><a href="https://github.com/JulienBernard3383279">Arte</a></strong> modified the test to work with other games, and some games respond incredibly well when combining Rush and Immediate.</p>

<p>Due to time constraints with holiday vacations, adjusting the photon sensor for different games, we weren't able to gather all of the numbers we wanted from other games.  However, with <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=The_Legend_of_Zelda:_The_Wind_Waker">Wind Waker</a> the numbers were interesting enough that we managed to get enough samples <em>right under the wire</em>, at least in Dolphin.  The graph above shows latency with default settings, <em>Immediately Present XFB</em> and the combined efforts of <em>Immediately Present XFB</em> and <em>Rush Frame Presentation</em>.  Note that the default settings were measured last, and as such the error range is estimated.</p>
<p>The reason why we wanted to squeeze in this particular case is because it demonstrates that combining <em>Rush Frame Presentation</em> and <em>Immediately Present XFB</em> can result in lower latency than what was possible before.  This is not always true, and this 10ms reduction is from an ideal example.  Unmodified <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Super_Smash_Bros._Melee">Melee</a>, for instance, showed the combination reducing latency by less than 4ms.  Some games saw no benefit from combining both features together.</p>
<p>In the end, how much these two new options will help varies greatly depending on the game and setup.  Currently, we've left them both disabled by default in the Configuration -&gt; Advanced Tab, but that may change as the settings get more testing and we gauge what users want the most.</p>
<h4 id="2509-74-gamecube-add-sdl-stock-profile-by-samb"><strong><a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/download/dev/master/2509-74/">2509-74 - GameCube - Add SDL Stock Profile</a></strong>  by <strong><a href="https://github.com/Sam-Belliveau">Samb</a></strong><a href="#2509-74-gamecube-add-sdl-stock-profile-by-samb" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>Unlike the wacky Wii Remote and its mess of attachments, the GameCube Controller mostly mirrors modern controllers.  Sure, the sticks can't be pushed in, it's missing a shoulder button, the two stage analog+digital triggers can be tricky, and the face buttons are weird. But at the end of the day, it's a four face button, twin stick controller with a D-pad. Close enough?</p>
<p>So we have added an SDL Profile that players can use to speed up their GameCube controller mapping. </p>


<p>Using the profile is simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go the GameCube "Standard Controller" mapping window.</li>
<li>Select your controller from the Device dropdown. Pick the variant that starts with "SDL".</li>
<li>Select the <code>SDL Gamepad (Stock)</code> Profile and click Load.</li>
<li>Optional: Calibrate your joysticks (please don't skip this Hall effect users!) and set up deadzone.</li>
<li>Enjoy.  </li>
</ol>
<p>Since the GameCube controller doesn't map 1:1 to modern controllers, this is a <em>best guess</em> stock profile that will <em>reasonably</em> work for most people, most controllers, and most games. If a game demands a button combination that doesn't work with your hands on your controller, or if the face buttons or any other button simply aren't to your liking, you can build from the stock profile and adjust everything until it's just right.</p>

<p>Dolphin is a complicated emulator with a lot of options.  Some of it is definitely our fault, and some of it is just the reality of trying to emulate something as complicated as the GameCube and Wii.  To the average user, a lot of these settings aren't immediately obvious, even with descriptions.</p>
<p>"<em>Emulated Memory this?  EFB, XFB that, VBI what?</em>"</p>
<p>The most experienced users (and even developers) can sometimes get frustrated enough with an issue that <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/percussive_maintenance">percussive maintenance</a> is necessary, leading to one changing lots of settings around until <em>something</em> happens.  Sometimes this works, leading to a temporary moment of joy, before it all comes crashing down when none of your other games will boot.  Some people might be able to backtrack and figure out what went wrong, but a lot of users are left lost.</p>
<p>Until recently, users had to delete the Dolphin settings files from their computer to restore everything to default.   No one liked that, but a button to reset settings was non-trivial thanks to <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2017/07/01/dolphin-progress-report-june-2017/#50-4171-videoconfig-port-to-layered-configuration-system-by-merrymage">Dolphin's multiple layers of settings</a> that are a handful to manage.</p>
<p>Thankfully, <strong><a href="https://github.com/JoshuaVandaele">JoshuaVandaele</a></strong> was finally able to sort out all of the implementation details and give us the long awaited "Reset All Settings" button.</p>


<p>Thanks to <strong><a href="https://github.com/Simonx22">Simonx22</a></strong>, Android users also get access to this feature.  It can be found in the advanced settings menu in the Android GUI.</p>

<p>Some games are more strenuous to emulate than others.  Sometimes it's because the <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=The_Last_Story">game pushes the console</a>, and other times it's because the game does something <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2025/09/16/dolphin-progress-report-release-2509/#2506-29-game-patch-defang-the-disney-trio-of-destruction-by-josjuice-and-billiard">annoying to emulate - maliciously or not.</a></p>
<p>The latter situation can be especially frustrating, as sometimes 99% of what the game does is fine, with just <em>one</em> little behavior, design decision, or sometimes even an underlying bug causing problems for Dolphin.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/SuperSamus">SuperSamus</a></strong> identified a few common game behaviors that causes Dolphin a lot of headaches.  Properly fixing these issues would difficult, with some requiring large rewrites to the emulator that probably will never come.  Fortunately, there is a simpler solution: patch out the difficult to emulate game behaviors.  These small patches increase emulation performance, and sometimes even work around other unwanted behaviors.</p>
<h5 id="complex-idle-loops"><strong>Complex Idle Loops</strong><a href="#complex-idle-loops" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h5>
<p>Idle loops are a sequence of instructions that makes the CPU run laps doing nothing while it waits for something to happen.  Obviously, emulating a CPU burning cycles doing nothing isn't efficient for an emulator, so one of Dolphin's earliest optimizations was the ability to detect and skip these idle loops. This feature is fairly standard among emulators and is called <em>Idle Skipping</em>.</p>
<p>Idle loops are more common than you might think. It's very rare for a game to absolutely max out the console's CPU, so <em>for the majority of frames</em> the CPU will idle a bit. And as long as Dolphin can detect the idle loops, they can be skipped to increase overall performance.  <em>Idle Skipping</em> is one of the key things that make some areas of a game more demanding than others, especially on the CPU side of things.  Essentially, <em>Idle Skipping</em> is less effective the more that the CPU has to do.</p>
<p>Dolphin can't detect all idle loops, and the scope of what it can find is rather limited.  We have to find as many idle loops as accurately as possible while also ensuring that we don't invest too much time and resources into finding them.  The more complex the heuristic is, the more of an impact it will have on the JIT.  As such, some games have annoying idle loops that we know about but are not worth detecting.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Need_for_Speed:_Nitro">Need for Speed: Nitro</a> and <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Rayman_Raving_Rabbids">Rayman Raving Rabbids</a> are two such games with these complex idle loops. After examining their code in detail, <strong><a href="https://github.com/SuperSamus">SuperSamus</a></strong> realized that their idling behaviors could be modified with a patch that would allow Dolphin to more easily detect and skip them.</p>
<p>This results in <em>massive</em> performance boosts, especially in lighter areas, with some menus running at four times as fast.  Of course, heavier areas see less of a benefit. We'll have a chart showing some of the raw numbers at the end.</p>
<h5 id="running-uncapped"><strong>Running Uncapped</strong><a href="#running-uncapped" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h5>
<p>Dolphin is not a cycle accurate emulator.  In fact, Dolphin is fundamentally not designed to be cycle accurate, especially with GPU operations. Dolphin's emulated GPU was designed to be <strong>infinitely fast</strong>, only being limited by other factors like CPU emulation or the maximum performance of the host device. Nowadays, it has been tamed a bit with synchronization points that provide a rough approximation of the timings of the original <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2025/09/16/dolphin-progress-report-release-2509/#processor-processing">command processor</a>, but it is still by no means accurate, let alone <em>cycle</em> accurate. Also, rendering is still infinitely fast, as the only thing that limits it is the speed of your host GPU.</p>
<p>And yet, most games run at the correct frame rate, because they <em>limit themselves</em>.</p>
<p>The GameCube and Wii were designed for analog TVs, so they used the analog television's sign to start a new frame as a synchronization point called the <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2023/02/12/dolphin-progress-report-december-2022-january-2023/#50-18271-video-hack-vbi-skip-by-sam-belliveau">Vertical Blanking Interupt (VBI)</a>. All a game had to do was start a new frame every time it saw a VBI and finish the frame before the next VBI, and it would be perfectly synchronized to the frame rate of the display. That's it. It was simple and efficient, so the vast majority of GameCube and Wii library tie their frame rates to the VBI. Thanks to that, Dolphin's early developers didn't even need to care about how fast the emulated GPU runs; as long Dolphin emits VBIs at the correct frequency, most games will just run at the correct frame rate regardless of what's going on under the hood. And this gives Dolphin bonuses like not emulating GPU slowdown, allowing games that struggled on console to perform much better in Dolphin.</p>
<p>But the GameCube and Wii don't have operating systems. Games run on the bare metal and have full control of the machine, so developers could do <em>whatever they wanted</em>.  And some games eschew the VBI and run <strong>uncapped</strong>.</p>
<p>Uncapped games break Dolphin's assumptions. They can render way, <em>way</em> too fast.  For example, when running <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Hulk">Hulk (2003)</a> in Dolphin, it only displays at 60 FPS, but the physics engine could be doing hundreds of steps per second behind the scenes.  This is cool because technically a game like this can easily be hacked to run at higher frame rates, but <em>terrible</em> because it hammers people's devices with all kinds of unnecessary work!</p>
<p>It gets even worse from here.  The physics engine's independence from the output frame rate isn't <em>perfect</em>.  If the number of steps per second gets too high, small rounding and math errors start to accumulate, and parts of the game not properly tuned to run at these higher frame rates start to break.  This mostly results in dialogue timing issues, but in one stage halfway through the game, it causes a physics calculation issue where a required ledge can't be climbed, essentially softlocking the player.</p>


<p>Some other games choose to synchronize to the VBI, but don't bother in incredibly simple scenes where the frame rate doesn't matter.  This is most commonly seen with splash screens and loading screens.  One such game with this behavior is <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Bully:_Scholarship_Edition">Bully: Scholarship Edition</a>. Most of the time it is perfectly stable, but because the loading screens are uncapped, it can actually cause the game to randomly hang on transitions.  <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=The_Simpsons_Hit_%26_Run">The Simpsons Hit &amp; Run</a> also has this issue, but only during the initial load.  While most desktop computers are able to handle the initial load relatively well, Android users have reported tremendous slowdowns where the loading time would take more than 45 seconds.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/SuperSamus">SuperSamus</a></strong> identified these problems and either created patches for these behaviors themselves, or helped others with those titles create patches.  Most of these patches are only one or two lines and simply limit the game's frame rate to the VBI frequency.  The patches prevent the game from slamming Dolphin's overpowered emulated GPU, greatly increasing performance while fixing issues caused by the games running internally at too high of a frame rate.</p>
<p>This comes with a little bonus - since they are now bound to the VBI frequency, you can now use <em>VBI Frequency Override</em> to adjust their frame rate up or down as desired, allowing Dolphin to take advantage of the fact that these games "support" running at higher frame rates.</p>
<p>In addition to the games above that had emulation bugs caused by framelimiting, <strong><a href="https://github.com/SuperSamus">SuperSamus</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://github.com/jordan-woyak">Billiard</a></strong> also created limiter patches for the following games purely for performance reasons:</p>

<center><p>Somewhat ironically, by slowing down uncapped games we improve their performance in Dolphin, so when turning off Dolphin's framelimiter they go much faster. ...ignore that and use this as a measure of their performance improvement. If a game's frame rate doubled in this chart, then the performance required to run that game at fullspeed has been roughly halved.</p></center>

<p>These numbers don't tell the whole story on some of these games.  <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Hulk">Hulk (2003)</a> and other games which ran uncapped would get progressively worse performance in Dolphin depending on how <em>light</em> the scene was to render.</p>
<p>As a final reminder, these patches should not be considered proper solutions to fixing uncapped games.  They are purely to increase playability of these titles.</p>

<p>The Broadband Adapter (BBA) for the GameCube was all about connecting games to a network. Whether across the hall with a Local Area Network (LAN) or across the continent with the information superhighway, the BBA brought Nintendo consoles together like nothing before it! Well, except the <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2024/04/30/dolphin-progress-report-february-march-and-april-2024/#50-21253-implement-modem-adapter-by-fuzziqersoftware">Modem Adapter</a>, but we're not talking about that today.</p>
<p>Dolphin has supported the BBA emulation for many years.  An early LLE implementation was fairly accurate, but required the user to setup TAP servers and suffered from performance bottlenecks with said TAP servers depending on the operating system.  It wasn't until <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2022/09/13/dolphin-progress-report-july-and-august-2022/#50-16838-add-hle-broadband-device-by-schthack-and-many-additional-fixes-by-sepalani">BBA-HLE</a> in 2022 that BBA emulation became readily accessible to the average user.</p>


<p>BBA-HLE is great if you want to connect Dolphin to another computer or real hardware.  But if you want to run multiple instances <em>on the same computer</em>, things get more complicated.  While it was technically possible through networking trickery, it was far beyond what we'd expect of the average user.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/cristian64">cristian64</a></strong> realized that this problem could be pretty cleanly solved by using a library called <code>cpp-ipc</code>.  This library would allow <em>separate instances</em> of Dolphin on the same machine to share data easily and efficiently through Inter-Process Communication (IPC).  Instead of using a network stack, we can just simulate the instances of Dolphin being in their very own network and let them communicate without the need for any outside support. </p>
<p>With BBA-IPC added, here's a quick rundown of the many options you have for BBA.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Broadband Adapter (TAP)</strong>: Dolphin's LLE solution for the Broadband Adapter that requires a TAP interface.</li>
<li><strong>Broadband Adapter (XLink-Kai)</strong>:  LLE solution that can connect to the Xlink-Kai service to allow players on separate networks to connect together.  Success highly depends on each game's latency tolerance and the latency between the players.</li>
<li><strong>Broadband Adapter (HLE)</strong>:  HLE solution that hooks the Broadband Adapter up to the host's network interface to connect with other devices on the network or to a server for certain online games.</li>
<li><strong>Broadband Adapter (IPC)</strong>:  HLE solution that allows Dolphin instances on the same machine to share memory and communicate directly without the need for a host network.</li>
</ul>
<p>BBA-IPC allows for easy testing of BBA features on a single PC, and can also be used in conjunction with game streaming services like Parsec to play BBA titles over the internet without needing to meet the strict latency requirements of emulating the BBA over the internet. This is admittedly a rather niche usecase for BBA, but the feature is relatively compact and easy to maintain.</p>
<p>Currently, only Windows and Linux are supported by BBA-IPC, but if there is enough interest, <strong><a href="https://github.com/cristian64">cristian64</a></strong> has already found another library that could let us support this in other operating systems.</p>

<p>Playing <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Wii">Mario Kart Wii</a> online in Dolphin back when WFC support was first added was a rather rough experience.  It was functional, but slow and stuttery, just enough to be playable and help players with preserving traffic to the official WFC in the final months before the servers were finally shut down.</p>
<p>But that wasn't the end.  Thanks to revival efforts, many Wii games still have online communities, with <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Wii">Mario Kart Wii</a> being quite possibly the biggest.  In the years since, Dolphin's Wi-Fi emulation has gotten to the point that users can play alongside real Wiis in most games without any issues.</p>
<p>Well, <em>most</em> users.  Unfortunately, even in modern builds of Dolphin there were a couple of users having severe stuttering and freezing problems, and all of them were using Android devices.  These problems were handwaved away as typical Android performance issues at first, but after closer examination, it was obvious that there was something else going wrong.  One user recorded us tons of examples and helped narrow down what was happening.</p>

<p>They (accurately!) surmized that it had something to do with a player joining or leaving the online lobby.  In <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Mario_Kart_Wii">Mario Kart Wii</a>, players can join or leave a race mid-match, with new players spectating until the next race began.  The only mystery left was figuring out why this was only happening to a couple of users while everyone else was fine.</p>
<p>Using their wealth of knowledge from working on the <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Monster_Hunter_Tri">Monster Hunter Tri</a> <a href="https://forum.wii-homebrew.com/index.php/Thread/60432-Monster-Hunter-Tri-private-server-progress/">replacement Wi-Fi servers</a>, <strong><a href="https://github.com/sepalani">sepalani</a></strong> jumped in and investigated the issue.  Same as us, they couldn't find any issues at first. They were able to play without any kind of freezing, even on their phone.  However, after unlocking the frame rate on a desktop computer, <strong><a href="https://github.com/sepalani">sepalani</a></strong> noticed a small hitch when the function <code>InetAToN</code> was called.  This hitch was impossible to see when running at normal speed, but when running at 1000%+ speed, the dip was just barely noticeable.</p>
<p><code>InetAToN</code> is a standard networking function that takes an IP address string and converts it into its equivalent binary form. For example, the string <code>192.51.100.50</code> would be transformed into the hexadecimal number <code>0xC0336432</code>. On the Wii, <code>InetAToN</code> has some additional functionality that is unusual: in addition to text-based IPs, it also accepts <em>hostnames</em> as inputs. This means that a developer can choose to pass a hostname like <code>google.com</code> into <code>InetAToN</code>, and the function will perform a <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-us/learning/dns/what-is-dns/">Domain Name System</a> (DNS) lookup to resolve the hostname into an IP address. </p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/sepalani">sepalani</a></strong> figured out that if a hostname was provided to <code>InetAToN</code> and the resulting DNS lookup was slow enough, the function would cause a stutter because Dolphin waits for the result of the lookup before continuing. The time it takes for a DNS lookup to finish varies depending on various factors, such as the user's internet connection. On a desktop PC connected to home internet, the lookup would complete before the user even saw a frame drop. But many of our Android users are connected to the internet via cellular data, which can have particularly poor latency depending on signal strength and network congestion.</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong><a href="https://github.com/sepalani">sepalani</a></strong> changed <code>InetAToN</code> to be non-blocking so that DNS resolution can take as long as it wants without locking up the emulator.</p>

<p>There's no way to sugarcoat this one.  This was a pretty bad %$#&amp; up.  Dolphin's SD card emulation was broken, and has been broken for a very long time.  Yet somehow, <em>it worked</em>. This is one of the dangers of emulation - sometimes you can do something very wrong yet the software just trudges on.  </p>
<p>The modern Wii homebrew scene lives off of SD Cards.  It's a convenient tool available on <em>most</em> Wiis, and can be used in conjunction with the <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Homebrew_Channel">Homebrew Channel</a>, BootMii, and other essential homebrew.  It's not uncommon to see a 32GB SD card in a Wii loaded with homebrew emulators, software, and game mods.</p>
<p>One oddity about the Wii is that it was released <em>without</em> support for the then new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SD_card#SDHC">SDHC standard</a> (2GB to 32GB SD cards).  This would be rectified in <a href="https://wiibrew.org/wiki/System_Menu_4.0">an update three years later</a>, but the damage was done.  <a href="https://hackmii.com/2009/02/why-the-wii-will-never-get-any-better/">Thanks to the way Nintendo designed the Wii's software stack</a>, games released prior to SDHC support being added would be forced to use older IOSes that lacked SDHC support.  Even if your System Menu, homebrew, and newer games worked with your big SD card, a game like <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Super_Smash_Bros._Brawl">Super Smash Bros. Brawl</a> wouldn't.  At least without some help.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Super_Smash_Bros._Brawl">Brawl</a> community refused to be restricted by Nintendo's paltry limitations. They used homebrew to load the game with newer IOS versions and even patched the game to remove the nonsensical 3 minute time limit on replays.  Small patches like these were just the beginning, as the community started making bigger changes to the game, like balance patches Brawl+ and Brawl-, and eventually full game overhauls like Project M and its offspring.</p>
<p>The Smash Bros. community is still pushing the limits of homebrew on both the Wii and Dolphin.  One such effort is <a href="https://www.rexbuild.site/">Super Smash REX</a>.  REX has an astounding amount of stages, music, and characters to the point that just the base mod is over <em>8GB</em> in size.  And that's where we come into all of this.</p>
<p>A developer from REX reached out to us about how they were reaching some kind of limit with the virtual SD card in Dolphin. Once the amount of data on the SD card exceeded <strong>10.7GiB</strong>, Dolphin's SD card support would completely fall apart.</p>


<p>This actually wasn't <em>too surprising</em>.  There have been scattered reports from <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Rock_Band_3">Rock Band 3</a> and <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Category:Just_Dance_(Series)">Just Dance</a> failing when too much DLC was installed to the SD card.  However, reproducing those issues required owning a mountain of DLC, which none of us did.  With REX, everything was readily available and the actual launcher was just a homebrew application.  This made reproducing the issue much easier, and they did most of the work for us.</p>
<p>The key detail was that the files on the SD card didn't even have to relate to the mod.  We could just fill it with cat pictures, load up the <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Homebrew_Channel">Homebrew Channel</a> or any other homebrew that relied on the SD card, and watch the fireworks.  What could be going wrong?</p>
<hr>
<p>In a community as old as the GameCube/Wii scene, there are some voices that <em>must</em> be heeded.  Before the REX developers reached out to us, one of the Supreme GameCube/Wii Sages, <strong><a href="https://github.com/extrems">extrems</a></strong>, hadst been prognosticating doom since the new year if a bug with the card ID (CID) and card-specific data (CSD) registers in our SD card emulation was not mended.  Verily, it came to pass.</p>


<p>The problem was extremely straightforward.  When the emulated Wii queried the virtual SD card for its capabilities, such as size and speed, Dolphin would return <em>complete garbage</em> due to the reports being in the wrong byte order.  The strange part of this was that SD card emulation even worked <em>at all</em>.</p>
<p>When REX reported there were SD card issues, we quickly thought of the flaws that <strong><a href="https://github.com/extrems">extrems</a></strong> pointed out to us.  However, knowing the problem and fixing it were two very different things.  Our attempts to make things right only made things worse.  Two different developers took a stab at it, and both left SD card emulation completely non-functional.  We were left defeated and efforts on the problem slowed.</p>
<p>In mid-November, <strong><a href="https://github.com/jordan-woyak">Billiard</a></strong> was perusing <s>Pull Requests</s> ancient tomes of knowledge that fell through the cracks. One such tome was named "SDIO: report write lock status".  Emulating a SD card's write lock switch was a rather unimportant implementation detail that would not affect emulation.  As such, there was no rush to review it.  But when <strong><a href="https://github.com/jordan-woyak">Billiard</a></strong> did finally get to reviewing it, he saw that it <em>also fixed Dolphin's CID and CSD byte ordering</em>.</p>
<p>A few quick reviews and a rebase later, and the bug was finally quelled.  Now Dolphin properly works with virtual SD cards up to 32GB in size.</p>

<p>The Logitech Microphone is an iconic accessory for the Nintendo Wii.  <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Category:USB_Microphone_(Input_supported)">Roughly 100 games</a>, including popular titles in the <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Category:Guitar_Hero_(Series)">Guitar Hero</a> and <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Category:Rock_Band_(Series)">Rock Band</a> series, support the peripheral.</p>
<p>Dolphin has had support for the <em>physical</em> Logitech Microphone via USB Passthrough for years, but even as other USB peripherals received their emulated counterparts, those wanting to sing into an emulated Wii using generic microphones had to wait.  <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2025/06/04/dolphin-progress-report-release-2506/#2503-580-wii-speak-emulation-by-shuffle2-degasus-noahpistilli-and-sepalani">Even the maligned Wii Speak received support</a> before the Logitech Microphone, despite the fact that it supported far fewer games and was much more complicated to implement.  This is just how emulation works sometimes. The more complicated, less useful accessory was just far more interesting than the popular, yet generic accessory.</p>
<p>But the foundation created for emulating the Wii Speak did lend itself well toward implementing a second microphone accessory in Dolphin.  After all, the Wii Speak <em>was</em> a microphone, so a few people took shots at adapting the Wii Speak code to work with the Logitech Microphone.</p>
<p>First, <a href="https://github.com/supermilkdude67">supermilkdude67</a> posted a WIP fork with very basic support that fizzled out.  A few months later, <a href="https://retroachievements.org/forums/topic/32317">a certain announcement</a> brought renewed interest toward making the many singing games more accessible to users.  <strong><a href="https://github.com/Biendeo">Biendeo</a></strong> took over the mantle using the initial fork as a base.  With some help from veteran Dolphin developers, a few fixes, and some upgrades to the GUI, it was ready to go.</p>


<p>You can now emulate the Logitech Microphone with any standard PC microphone!  The exact volume levels might need to be adjusted depending on the input source, so make sure you properly calibrate before your first jam session. Given that this is a new feature, compatiblity isn't perfect, and some games may take more fiddling than others.</p>
<p>For our Android users, things aren't ready yet.  While the core feature should be mostly compatible between the two environments, it will need a completely different GUI.  As such, it might be a while before everything gets ported over to our Android builds.</p>
<h4 id="2509-406-on-screen-display-add-new-default-font-by-trytwo"><strong><a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/download/dev/master/2509-406/">2509-406 - On-Screen Display:  Add New Default Font</a></strong>  by <strong><a href="https://github.com/TryTwo">TryTwo</a></strong><a href="#2509-406-on-screen-display-add-new-default-font-by-trytwo" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>Dolphin's On-Screen Display is an important part of communicating with users, whether it's statistics, performance metrics, or notifications from features like RetroAchievements.  Unfortunately, the pixel font we were using could be hard to read, especially for some users with HiDPI screens.  <strong><a href="https://github.com/TryTwo">TryTwo</a></strong> improved the situation by <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/download/dev/master/2509-59/">adding the ability to change the font size of on-screen display messages</a>, but this didn't solve the problem - making a pixel font larger can look quite bad, especially at non-integer scales.  Dolphin needed a new font that could scale to arbitrary resolutions while still looking clear.</p>
<p>With this change, Dolphin's OSD now uses a proper vector font!</p>


<p>Vera Sans Mono is the new default font.  We think that in pretty much every scenario, it's easier to read than our old font.  However, <strong><a href="https://github.com/TryTwo">TryTwo</a></strong> figured that since we were adding a font anyway, that Dolphin could just provide the ability for users to override the font.  So if you're unsatisfied with our typography tastes, add the font of your choice to the "Load" folder of your User directory and name it "OSD_Font.ttf". Any TrueType font will work!</p>


<p>Now that the On-Screen Display has even more options, we've decided to consolidate them within their own config section.  So if you're looking to adjust what is displayed, font size, or if you want them disabled altogether, the settings can now be found in one place within the On-Screen Display section of the Configuration window.</p>

<p>If you were an arcade junkie in the late 90s and early 2000s, then you're probably familiar with the Midway classic <em><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Category:NFL_Blitz_(Series)">NFL Blitz</a></em>.  Authentic teams thrust into a deliberately inaccurate simulation with colorful gameplay and flashy graphics made the series a bombastic hit in arcades.  And of course, the blisteringly difficult AI that would <em>absolutely cheat</em> drained quarters from avid players, making it enticing for arcade owners as well.</p>


<p>In this, we're not talking about beloved or hated arcade games, but instead the home console exclusive <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=NFL_Blitz_Pro">NFL Blitz Pro</a>.  This attempt to adapt to the console landscape was a commercial failure that lacked the charm and personality of the earlier titles.  And we can confirm the popularity thing - this title had broken audio by default in Dolphin for <em>over four years</em> with no one making a formal bug report and only two forgotten comments throughout our community.</p>
<p>It wasn't until <strong><a href="https://github.com/jordan-woyak">Billiard</a></strong> was testing games to see if they worked with <em>Immediately Present XFB</em> that we became aware that the game's sound was broken.</p>


<p>After doing some quick testing, <strong><a href="https://github.com/jordan-woyak">Billiard</a></strong> realized that DSP-LLE resolved the issue, and with no further leads he made a setting adjustment and <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/download/dev/master/2509-551/">disabled HLE audio for this game by default in 2509-551</a>.</p>


<p>The very next day, <strong><a href="https://github.com/tilka">flacs</a></strong> saw the audio regression, found what build broke it, figured out why it was broken, <em>and</em> fixed the issue.  <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=NFL_Blitz_Pro">NFL Blitz Pro</a> is another game that uses the low-pass filter.  In Dolphin, the low-pass filter was notoriously broken and left <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2021/08/01/dolphin-progress-report-june-and-july-2021/#50-14712-dsp-hle-re-enable-low-pass-filter-by-flacs-original-fix-by-merrymage">completely disabled for many, many years</a>.  During the process in which the feature was finally fixed and re-enabled, no one thought to test this game. If we had, we would have noticed that it hit an edge-case in the HLE implementation of the low-pass filter.</p>
<p>When the game reserves a region of memory, its memory allocator sets all bytes within the region to <code>0xAB</code>.  This behavior isn't necessarily abnormal, as the initial state of the memory shouldn't matter. When using freshly allocated memory, it is best practice to first initialize it with sane default values before attempting to use it. Unfortunately, the developers of <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=NFL_Blitz_Pro">NFL Blitz Pro</a> forgot to perfom this initialization when reserving memory for the game's audio engine. The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/07/30/the-musyx-experience">MusyX library</a> determines if the low-pass filter is enabled by checking if the appropriate bytes within its assigned memory region are not zero.  Because <code>0xAB</code> is not zero, the library assumes that the low-pass filter should be enabled.</p>
<p>Because most audio related memory is still in the default state of <code>0xAB</code>, the two low pass filter coefficients are <em>also</em> set to <code>0xABAB</code>.  When DSP-HLE goes to calculate how much the low-pass filter should quiet or amplify things, it adds these values together.  For our purposes, the values are interpreted by the game as 16-bit fixed point values, so the coefficients would be roughly <code>1.341156</code>.  These two values <em>added together</em> are supposed to add up to about <code>1.0</code>, but in this case the result is roughly <code>2.682312</code>.  DSP-HLE sees this number and boosts the volume accordingly, making things sound rather unpleasant.</p>

</figure>
</p>
<p>The programmers were using uninitialized memory by accident, which is a game bug.  Regardless of their intent, these were the values that the game used.  So why was Dolphin broken?  <strong><a href="https://github.com/tilka">flacs</a></strong> figured out that the second filter value is actually a <em>signed</em> value.  For a typical 16-bit fixed point value, this means positive values are <code>0x0000</code> to <code>0x7FFF</code>, and negative values are <code>0x8000</code> to <code>0xFFFF</code>.  <code>0xABAB</code> is supposed to be interpreted as a <em>negative</em> value.</p>
<p>With the bug fixed, the equation changes to <code>1.34 + (-0.66)</code>, giving us a coefficient sum of roughly <code>0.68</code>.  The filter is still active and now <em>lowering</em> the volume of the game, but this is accurate to real hardware. It seems that the developers worked around the filter's unintentional activation by just making the game louder to compensate.  By handling these uninitialized values correctly, DSP-HLE now produces proper audio in this title.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>Execution of C# code in Unity’s Mono runtime is slow by today’s standards, much slower than you might expect! Our game runs 2-3x faster on modern .NET compared to Unity’s Mono, and in a few small benchmarks I measured speedups of up to 15x. I’ve spent some time investigating what’s going on and in this article I will present my findings and why everyone should want Unity’s .NET modernization to become production-ready as soon as possible.</p>
		
<h2 id="How-did-we-get-here">How did we get here</h2>

<p>
	Unity uses the Mono framework to run C# programs and back in 2006 it was one of the only viable multi-platform implementations of .NET.
	Mono is also open-source, allowing Unity to do some tweaks to better suit game development.
</p>
<p>
	An interesting twist happened nearly 10 years later.
	In 2014, Microsoft began open-sourcing .NET (notably .NET Core later that year) and in June 2016, .NET Core 1.0 shipped with official cross-platform support.
	Since then, the .NET ecosystem gained momentum and lots of improvements have been made, including the Roslyn compiler platform, a new JIT (just-in-time compiler), performance improvements, more features, etc.
</p>
<p>
	In 2018, <a href="https://xoofx.github.io/blog/2018/04/06/porting-unity-to-coreclr/" target="_blank">Unity engineers discussed</a> that they are working on porting the engine to .NET CoreCLR, the multi-platform version of Common Language Runtime (CLR), a component that runs .NET programs.
	Their main motivations behind this project were performance and convergence.
	In their post they said:
</p>
<blockquote>...CoreCLR could be great for Unity game developers, as it will provide a significant boost in performance, by an order of 2x to 5x compare to the Mono runtime sometimes up to x10 on some workload!</blockquote>
<p>
	Unfortunately, now it’s the end of 2025 and we still can’t run games on CoreCLR.
</p>


<h2 id="The-performance-gap">The performance gap</h2>

<p>
	We don’t hear about the performance gap between Mono and .NET much, likely because it is not possible to run games written for Unity under modern .NET.
	But we can still do a direct comparison with code that does not depend on Unity directly.
</p>
<p>
	Our game has a unique architecture – we strictly separate the game simulation code (business logic) from rendering.
	So much so that the simulation code does not depend on Unity’s libraries and can be compiled and run under any .NET version.
</p>
<p>
	One day I was debugging an issue in map generation and it was time-consuming because it was taking over 2 minutes to start a game.
	To make debugging faster, I’ve written a unit test, hoping to cut down on the turn-around time since Unity takes 15+ seconds just to crunch new DLLs and reload the domain before the game can be launched and it also initializes rendering stuff that I did not care about.
	When I ran the test, it finished in 40 seconds.
	I was quite surprised that it was more than 3x faster, so I started digging deeper.
</p>
<p>
	Long story short, <a href="#figure-1" title="Go to figure 1: A trace of game startup in Unity and .NET, Debug mode.">Figure 1</a> shows traces from a profiler showing the difference between the game launching in Unity running under Mono vs. a unit test running under .NET.
</p>
<p>
	<i>Note that all shown benchmarks are using either Unity 6.0 or .NET 10.</i>
</p>

<div id="figure-1"><p><span>Figure 1: A trace of game startup in Unity and .NET, Debug mode.</span></p></div>

<p>
	So our benchmark shows that loading a save file, generating a map, and initializing the simulation takes 100 seconds in Unity/Mono but only 38 seconds in .NET.
	This result alone is already something that may raise eyebrows and has real consequences of how you may want to approach debugging and testing.
</p>
<p>
	I also know from experience with Unity that Release mode running as a standalone executable (without the Unity editor) is much faster, so I decided to test that next.
</p>

<h2 id="NET-vs-Mono-in-standalone-Release-mode">.NET vs. Mono in standalone Release mode</h2>
<p>
	Debug mode slowness is not great, but even non-optimized C++ code can be slow.
	To compare the real performance gap between Mono and .NET, let’s run the same benchmark as above but in release mode, standalone executable.
</p>
<p>
	First up: Unity. I’ve run our deploy script to get an optimized executable and run it directly.
	Unsurprisingly, optimized standalone executable is beating Unity editor by a big margin, more than 3x faster.
	Next, the same code running under .NET in Release mode.
	<a href="#figure-2" title="Go to figure 2: A trace of game startup in Unity and .NET, Release mode">Figure 2</a> shows the results.
</p>
<div id="figure-2"><p><span>Figure 2: A trace of game startup in Unity and .NET, Release mode</span></p></div>

<p>
	Yep. 12 seconds.
	It’s actually mind-boggling how much work is being done in these 12 seconds and when I saw this for the first time, I was not only shocked, but also impressed.
	Just so you know, a 4k × 4k map is being generated using all available threads out of hundreds of combined noise functions in like 3 seconds.
	<a href="#figure-3" title="Go to figure 3: The expanded trace of the 12-second run from above. The blue boxes after the highlighted area is the actual unit test, stepping the game.">Figure 3</a> shows the trace expanded.

<p>
	If you are interested in seeing the actual x86 assembly generated by Mono and .NET JITs, see the Extras section at the end of this article.
</p>


<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>
	As you can see from the presented benchmarks, Mono is massively behind .NET in terms of performance.
	This is primarily due to differences in runtime optimizations and JIT that generates unoptimized assembly.
	The actual speedup surely depends on the code itself, but from my research, 1.5-3x speedup of C# execution is very likely for most projects.
</p>
<p>
	If you are a game developer using Unity, or even a player, you can now understand that <b>CoreCLR would be a massive boost to performance of games and even the Unity editor</b>.
	Unfortunately, for the past 8 years, Unity leadership was more interested in “other things” and did not give .NET modernization the attention it deserves.
</p>
<p>
	Some view .NET modernization as support for new language features in C#, but that is just a cherry on top.
	New C# adds some handy features, but the new JIT can deliver multi-x speedups.
</p>
<p>
	At this year's Unite conference, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEKmARCIkSI&amp;t=1502s" target="_blank">Unity announced</a>
	that CoreCLR is still ongoing but it won’t be production ready in 2026.
	The good news is that it now seems to be on the Unity 6.x roadmap, and not left for later versions as suggested by 2024’s Unite presentation.
</p>
<div id="figure-4"><p><span>Figure 4: Slides from Unite 2025 showing that .NET Modernization is planned for 6.x release with unannounced date.</span></p></div>
<p>
	Moreover, CoreCLR is not just new JIT and C#, it unlocks broader and better-optimized support for things like Span&lt;T&gt;-style APIs, hardware intrinsics, and newer SIMD paths that devs cannot use these days.
	These features could add another multiplier to the performance gains for some classes of code.
	For example, our map generator heavily uses 2D and 3D simplex noise.
	I bet that having access to new runtime features in CoreCLR could speed up the map generation by another 2x.
</p>
<p>
	Unity has a technology called Burst that automatically converts marked C# methods to optimized native assembly via the LLVM compiler.
	This sounds neat as it can avoid the poor JIT performance, but the downside is that Burst has strict limitations on what can be converted and supports only subset of C#.
	I believe that CoreCLR with modern JIT will have very similar performance characteristics to Burst.
	I am curious what would happen in a universe where Unity invested all the time and effort in CoreCLR support and high-performance C#, instead of developing and maintaining Burst.
</p>
<p>
	Another interesting consequence of CoreCLR support is the ability to pre-compile the .NET intermediate assembly to machine code using ahead-of-time compilation (AOT).
	AOT can further improve startup time and is essential on platforms where JIT is restricted (notably iOS).
	Nowadays, Unity solves this with IL2CPP that takes the intermediate code and compiles it to C++ which is then optimized and compiled to native assembly.
	However, <a href="https://discussions.unity.com/t/the-unity-engine-roadmap-unite-2025/1696495/65" target="_blank">according to RichardFine (Unity staff)</a>,
	using CoreCLR AOT is not planned and IL2CPP is here to stay:
</p>
<blockquote>AOT for IL2CPP is completely independent of AOT for CoreCLR (which we have no plans to adopt anyway).
GC behaviour on IL2CPP improves when we upgrade the GC there, it’s not really affected by CoreCLR at all.</blockquote>
<p>
	In conclusion, CoreCLR won’t magically fix every bottleneck in a Unity game, but it does fix many of the code generation inefficiencies and allows writing higher-performance code.
	The benchmark presented in this article is meant to illustrate that modern .NET has spent years squeezing more work into fewer CPU cycles, and Unity users are largely locked out of those gains today.
</p>
<p>
	If Unity can deliver production-ready CoreCLR support, it won’t just mean “newer C#”.
	It will mean faster runtime performance, faster iteration times, more performance headroom, no domain reload, 
	better GC behavior, and maybe even more managed code and less native code. 
	Until then, the gap will remain an invisible tax on every Unity project that leans on managed code.
</p>
<p>
	I’m cheering for you, Unity devs, CoreCLR for the win!

<p>
	I have actually dug much deeper into the performance aspects of Mono vs .NET but for the sake of this article not being too long, here is a brief summary.
</p>
<p>
	<a href="#code-1" title="Go to code listing 1: Simple benchmark code">Code listing 1</a> shows the testing code.
	It does some basic summing of custom structs that are wrappers around ints.
	This is an interesting example because Mono is very bad at inlining and simplifying expressions, even obvious ones, and we have plenty of structs like these in our code base (e.g. Quantity, MechPower, Tile2i, etc).

<p>
	To obtain assembly code, I’ve compiled the code in Release mode and ran it as a standalone executable.
	Then, I attached a debugger to the running process. An easy way to find this loop was to make it long/infinite and just break the program at any time, it would end up in that loop.
</p>
<p>
	First, let’s take a look at .NET. Here is the x64 assembly of the for-loop section of the code.
</p>
<div id="code-2"><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
</pre></td><td><pre><span>add</span> r8d,edx
<span>add</span> edx,r10d
00007FFDEC338E88:
    <span>mov</span>  r10d,r8d
    <span>add</span>  r9d,r10d
    <span>mov</span>  r10d,edx
    <span>add</span>  r9d,r10d
    <span>inc</span>  ecx
    <span>cmp</span>  ecx,eax
    <span>jl</span>   00007FFDEC338E88</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div>
<p>
	In both cases, the full loop of <code>int.MaxValue</code> iterations took around 750 ms on my machine.
</p>
<p>
	This looks neat. Even if you don’t read assembly, you can see that there are two add instructions, one decrement, and one jump.
	It seems that the JIT hoisted the invariant sums <code>a = value1 + value2</code> and <code>b = value1 + value3</code> out of the loop and then just accumulates them.
</p>
<p>
	I also tested x86 assembly, and it looks very similar:
</p>
<div id="code-3"><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
</pre></td><td><pre>082E18D0:
    <span>lea</span>  ebx,[esi+edi]
    <span>add</span>  eax,ebx
    <span>lea</span>  ebx,[esi+edx]
    <span>add</span>  eax,ebx
    <span>dec</span>  ecx
    <span>jne</span>  082E18D0</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div>
<p>
	Interestingly, the loop direction was reversed, counting down.
	This saves one instruction as comparison to zero and conditional jump can be done as one instruction.
</p>
<p>
	Now let’s look at Mono’s x64 assembly.

	As you can see just from the number of instructions, this code will run way slower.
	The full loop of <code>int.MaxValue</code> iterations took around 11500 ms, that’s ~15x slower.
</p>
<p>
	In the assembly you can see the four add instructions in the loop, the “inefficient” increment + comparison + jump (instead of decrement + conditional jump), and most importantly a sea of mov instructions, which are just memory copies from inefficient inlining of the struct fields.
	Basically Mono is just tossing values around memory.
</p>
<p>
	I have also tested assembly compiled in Debug mode running in the Unity editor and it’s even worse.
	The full loop takes 67 seconds (67000 ms)! In Unity Editor, the JIT likely switches to far less optimized codegen and includes additional checks/sequence-point overhead, which balloons runtime.
</p>
<p>
	Takeaway: modern .NET’s JIT can scalarize tiny value types and hoist invariant work so the hot loop becomes a handful of register ops, while Mono often fails to do so and ends up shuffling values through memory, exactly the kind of gap that shows up as slowdowns in real simulation-heavy code.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><header></header><section><p>A lot of my readers <a href="https://lobste.rs/c/ch8tn0">call</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46085088">me</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46082989">a cynic</a> when I say things like “you should do things that <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-to-ship">make your manager happy</a>” or “big tech companies <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/bad-code-at-big-companies">get to decide</a> what projects you work on”. Alex Wennerberg put the “Sean Goedecke is a cynic” case well in his post <a href="https://alexwennerberg.com/blog/2025-11-28-engineering.html"><em>Software Engineers Are Not Politicians</em></a>. Here are some excerpts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have no doubt that [Sean’s] advice is quite effective for navigating the upper levels of an organization dedicated to producing a large, mature software product. But what is lost is any sort of conception of value. Is it too naive to say that engineers are more than “tools in a political game”, they are specialized professionals whose role is to apply their expertise towards solving meaningful problems?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The irony is that this kind of thinking destroys a company’s ability to actually make money … the idea that engineers should begin with a self-conception of doing what their manager tells them to is, to me, very bleak. It may be a good way to operate smoothly within a bureaucratic organization, and of course, one must often make compromises and take direction, but it is a bad way to do good work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can see why people would think this way. But I <em>love</em> working in big tech companies! I do see myself as a professional solving meaningful problems. And I think navigating the organization to put real features or improvements in the hands of users is an excellent way - maybe the best way - to do good work.</p>
<p>Why do I write such cynical posts, then? Well, I think that a small amount of cynicism is necessary in order to think clearly about how organizations work, and to avoid falling into the trap of being overly cynical. In general, I think <strong>good engineers ought to be a little bit cynical</strong>.</p>
<h3>The idealist view is more cynical than idealists think</h3>
<p>One doctrinaire “idealist” view of software engineering goes something like this. I’m obviously expressing it in its most lurid form, but I do think many people believe this more or less literally:<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We live in a late-stage-capitalist hellscape, where large companies are run by aspiring robber barons who have no serious convictions beyond desiring power. All those companies want is for obedient engineering drones to churn out bad code fast, so they can goose the (largely fictional) stock price. Meanwhile, end-users are left holding the bag: paying more for worse software, being hassled by advertisements, and dealing with bugs that are unprofitable to fix. The only thing an ethical software engineer can do is to try and find some temporary niche where they can defy their bosses and do real, good engineering work, or to retire to a hobby farm and write elegant open-source software in their free time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you write it all out, I think it’s clear to see that this is <em>incredibly</em> cynical. At the very least, it’s a cynical way to view your coworkers and bosses, who are largely people like you: doing a job, balancing a desire to do good work with the need to please their own bosses. It’s a cynical way to view the C-staff of a company. I think it’s also inaccurate: from my limited experience, the people who run large tech companies really do want to deliver good software to users.</p>
<p>It’s idealistic only in the sense that it does not accept the need for individual software engineers to compromise. According to this view, <em>you</em> never need to write bad software. No matter how hard the company tells you to compromise and just get something out, you’re morally required to plant your feet and tell them to go to hell. In fact, by doing so, you’re taking a stand against the general degeneration of the modern software world. You’re protecting - unsung, like Batman - the needs of the end-user who will never know you exist.</p>
<p>I can certainly see the appeal of this view! But I don’t think it’s an <em>idealistic</em> appeal. It comes from seeing the world as fundamentally corrupted and selfish, and believing that real positive change is impossible. In other words, <strong>I think it’s a <em>cynical</em> appeal.</strong></p>
<h3>The cynical view is more idealistic than idealists think</h3>
<p>I don’t see a hard distinction between engineers being “tools in a political game” and professionals who solve meaningful problems. In fact, I think that in practice <strong>almost all meaningful problems are solved by playing political games</strong>.</p>
<p>There are very few problems that you can solve entirely on your own. Software engineers encounter more of these problems than average, because the nature of software means that a single engineer can have huge leverage by sitting down and making a single code change. But in order to make changes to large products - for instance, to make it possible for GitHub’s 150M users to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions">use LaTeX in markdown</a> - you need to coordinate with many other people at the company, which means you need to be involved in politics.</p>
<p>It is just a plain fact that software engineers are not the movers and shakers in large tech organizations. They do not set the direction of the company. To the extent that they have political influence, it’s in how they translate the direction of the company into specific technical changes. But <strong>that is actually quite a lot of influence!</strong> </p>
<p>Large tech companies serve hundreds of millions (or billions) of users. Small changes to these products can have a massive positive or negative effect in the aggregate. As I see it, choosing to engage in the messy, political process of making these changes - instead of washing your hands of it as somehow impure - is an act of idealism. </p>
<p>I think the position of a software engineer in a large tech company is similar to people who go into public service: idealistically hoping that they can do some good, despite knowing that they themselves will never set the broad strokes of government policy.</p>
<p>Of course, big-tech software engineers are paid far better, so many people who go into this kind of work in fact are purely financially-motivated cynics. But I’m not one of them! I think it’s possible, by doing good work, to help steer the giant edifice of a large tech company for the better.</p>
<h3>Cynicism as inoculation</h3>
<p>Cynical writing is like most medicines: the dose makes the poison. A healthy amount of cynicism can serve as an inoculation from being overly cynical.</p>
<p>If you don’t have an slightly cynical explanation for why engineers write bad code in large tech companies - such as the one I write about <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/bad-code-at-big-companies">here</a> - you risk adopting an overly cynical one. For instance, you might think that big tech engineers are being <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46082989">deliberately demoralized</a> as part of an anti-labor strategy to prevent them from unionizing, which is nuts. Tech companies are simply not set up to engage in these kind of conspiracies.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a slightly cynical explanation for why large tech companies sometimes make inefficient decisions - such as <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/seeing-like-a-software-company">this one</a> - you risk adopting an overly cynical one. For instance, you might think that tech companies are full of incompetent <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46133179">losers</a>, which is simply not true. Tech companies have a normal mix of strong and <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/weak-engineers">weak engineers</a>.</p>
<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p><strong>Idealist writing is massively over-represented in writing about software engineering</strong>. There is no shortage of books or blog posts (correctly) explaining that we ought to value good code, that we ought to be kind to our colleagues, that we ought to work on projects with positive real-world impact, and so on. There <em>is</em> a shortage of writing that accurately describes how big tech companies operate.</p>
<p>Of course, cynical writing can harm people: by making them sad, or turning them into bitter cynics. But <strong>idealist writing can harm people too</strong>. There’s a whole generation of software engineers who came out of the 2010s with a <em>factually incorrect</em> model of how big tech companies work, and who are effectively being fed into the woodchipper in the 2020s. They would be better off if they internalized a correct model of how these companies work: not just less likely to get into trouble, but better at achieving their own idealist goals<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/3777">https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/3777</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46414078">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="markdown-body" data-team-hovercards-enabled="true" data-turbolinks="false"><p dir="auto">In March 2026, I will be Mockito maintainer for 10 years (nearly a third of my whole life). Looking ahead, I decided that a decade milestone is a good moment to pass on maintainership to other folks. In the coming months until March, I will spend time ensuring a smooth transition in maintainership.</p>
<p dir="auto">In this issue I list several considerations why I made the decision. Communication and discussion of plans for future maintainership will be somewhere else, most likely in a separate GitHub issue. Stay tuned for that.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Energy drain because of JVM agent change</h2>
<p dir="auto">As you might know, Mockito 5 shipped a breaking change where its main artifact is now an agent. That's because starting JVM 22, the previous so-called "dynamic attachment of agents" is put behind a flag. This change makes sense from a security point-of-view and I support it.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, the way this was put forward to Mockito maintainers was energy draining to say the least. Mockito is probably the biggest user of such an agent and is often looked at for inspiration by other projects. As such, Mockito often pioneers on supporting JVM features, built on a solid foundation with ByteBuddy. Modules was such a feature that took months of hard work by Rafael to figure out, including providing feedback to JVM maintainers.</p>
<p dir="auto">Unfortunately such a collaborative way of working was not the case when discussing agents. To me, it felt like the feature was presented as a done deal because of security. While dynamic attachment is problematic in many ways, no alternative solutions were proposed. That's okay, as Mockito pioneers on these solutions, yet in this case I felt we were left alone.</p>
<p dir="auto">My personal take is that folks involved with the change severely underestimated the societal impact that it had. The fact that proper build support is non-existent to this day shows that agents are not a priority. That's okay if it isn't a priority, but when it was communicated with Mockito I perceived it as "Mockito is holding the JVM ecosystem back by using dynamic attachment, please switch immediately and figure it out on your own".</p>
<p dir="auto">Here, the fact that I (and others) are volunteers doing their best for the project, is important to understand the societal impact. When you put individuals under pressure, who do this work in their own time out of goodwill, things crumble. It's commonly joked about with XKCD's on the fact that the whole open source world relies on a couple of individuals. That couldn't be more true in this situation, where the collaborative system collapses when too much pressure is put on individual folks.</p>
<p dir="auto">This saga planted the seed to reconsider my position as maintainer.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Kotlin as the future and odd one out</h2>
<p dir="auto">It's undeniable that Kotlin as a language has grown in popularity in recent years. While Mockito maintains several flavors for JVM languages, these packages typically include sugar that makes integration nicer. In all cases, mockito-core remains the place where functionality is implemented.</p>
<p dir="auto">Unfortunately, this model doesn't nicely apply to Kotlin. Where almost all JVM languages work similarly under the hood, Kotlin often does things differently. This means that in several places in mockito-core, there are separate flows dedicated to Kotlin. Most often that's a direct result of Kotlin doing (in my opinion) shenanigans on the JVM that the JVM never intended to support, yet was able to.</p>
<p dir="auto">Even within Kotlin itself, features don't work consistently. Suspend functions are the most well-known example. As such, Mockito code becomes more spaghetti, it's API sometimes fully duplicated just to support a core Kotlin language feature and overall less maintainable.</p>
<p dir="auto">While I fully understand the reasons that developers enjoy the feature richness of Kotlin as a programming language, its underlying implementation has significant downsides for projects like Mockito. Quite frankly, it's not fun to deal with.</p>
<p dir="auto">To me, a future where Kotlin becomes more predominant is not a future that makes me hopeful I can keep on dedicating energy to Mockito.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Alternative open source activities</h2>
<p dir="auto">I have always been a fan of open source work and have contributed to hundreds of projects in all these years. Mockito is my most important project, but I have also consistently worked on others. In recent months, I have rediscovered the joy of programming by working on Servo. It's a web engine written in Rust.</p>
<p dir="auto">When I need to choose how I want to spend my 2 hours of evening time in a given week, I rarely preferred Mockito in the last year. In the past, Mockito was my go-to and I enjoyed it a lot. Nowadays, Servo and related projects provide significantly more enjoyment.</p>
<p dir="auto">Justifying why I needed to work on Mockito becomes difficult when (because of the above reasons) it feels like a chore. Volunteering work shouldn't feel like a chore, at least not for a long time.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Summing it up</h2>
<p dir="auto">As you have read, these three factors combined led me to the decision. The first point explains why I started to doubt my position, the second point why I am not hopeful for things to change in a good way and the third point how I found enjoyment in a different way.</p>
<p dir="auto">While these points had impact on me as maintainer, my hypothesis is that it doesn't apply to others in the same way. I know others are eager to work on Kotlin support for example. That's why I concluded that a decade is enough time to have helped Mockito forward. Now it's time for somebody else to take over, as I believe that's in the best interest of Mockito as a project. Because ultimately that's why I chose to become maintainer in the first place: I believed that with my work, I could improve Mockito for millions of software engineers.</p>
<p dir="auto">For those wondering: yes I wholeheartedly advise everyone to take on a volunteering task such as maintaining an open source project. It was an honour and privilege to do so and I thank those that I enjoyed working with.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>Purpose and Target Audience<a href="#purpose-and-target-audience" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First and foremost, a couple important terms:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Software-Defined Radio (SDR):</strong></dt><dd><p>As a <em>concept</em> it refers to using software to perform signal processing tasks that were traditionally performed by hardware, specific to radio/RF applications.  This software can be run on a general-purpose computer (CPU), FPGA, or even GPU, and it can be used for real-time applications or offline processing of recorded signals.  Analogous terms include “software radio” and “RF digital signal processing”.</p>
<p>As a <em>thing</em> (e.g., “an SDR”) it typically refers to a device that you can plug an antenna into and receive RF signals, with the digitized RF samples being sent to a computer for processing or recording (e.g., over USB, Ethernet, PCI).  Many SDRs also have transmit capabilities, allowing the computer to send samples to the SDR which then transmits the signal at a specified RF frequency.  Some embedded-style SDRs include an onboard computer.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Digital Signal Processing (DSP):</strong></dt><dd>The digital processing of signals; in our case, RF signals.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This textbook acts as a hands-on introduction to the areas of DSP, SDR, and wireless communications.  It is designed for someone who is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Interested in <em>using</em> SDRs to do cool stuff</li>
<li>Good with Python</li>
<li>Relatively new to DSP, wireless communications, and SDR</li>
<li>A visual learner, preferring animations over equations</li>
<li>Better at understanding equations <em>after</em> learning the concepts</li>
<li>Looking for concise explanations, not a 1,000 page textbook</li>
</ol>
<p>An example is a Computer Science student interested in a job involving wireless communications after graduation, although it can be used by anyone itching to learn about SDR who has programming experience.  As such, it covers the necessary theory to understand DSP techniques without the intense math that is usually included in DSP courses.  Instead of burying ourselves in equations, an abundance of images and animations are used to help convey the concepts, such as the Fourier series complex plane animation below.  I believe that equations are best understood <em>after</em> learning the concepts through visuals and practical exercises.  The heavy use of animations is why PySDR will never have a hard copy version being sold on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://pysdr.org/_images/fft_logo_wide.gif"><img alt="The PySDR logo created using a Fourier transform" src="https://pysdr.org/_images/fft_logo_wide.gif"></a></p><p>This textbook is meant to introduce concepts quickly and smoothly, enabling the reader to perform DSP and use SDRs intelligently.  It’s not meant to be a reference textbook for all DSP/SDR topics; there are plenty of great textbooks already out there, such as <a href="https://www.analog.com/en/education/education-library/software-defined-radio-for-engineers.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Analog Device’s SDR textbook</a> and <a href="http://www.dspguide.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dspguide.com</a>.  You can always use Google to recall trig identities or the Shannon limit.  Think of this textbook like a gateway into the world of DSP and SDR: it’s lighter and less of a time and monetary commitment, when compared to more traditional courses and textbooks.</p>
<p>To cover foundational DSP theory, an entire semester of “Signals and Systems”, a typical course within electrical engineering, is condensed into a few chapters.  Once the DSP fundamentals are covered, we launch into SDRs, although DSP and wireless communications concepts continue to come up throughout the textbook.</p>
<p>Code examples are provided in Python.  They utilize NumPy, which is Python’s standard library for arrays and high-level math.  The examples also rely upon Matplotlib, which is a Python plotting library that provides an easy way to visualize signals, arrays, and complex numbers.  Note that while Python is “slower” than C++ in general, most math functions within Python/NumPy are implemented in C/C++ and heavily optimized.  Likewise, the SDR API we use is simply a set of Python bindings for C/C++ functions/classes.  Those who have little Python experience yet a solid foundation in MATLAB, Ruby, or Perl will likely be fine after familiarizing themselves with Python’s syntax.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>This week has seen the announcement by the Trump Administration that they are going to be building "battleships", a subject that is well within my beat, so I figured I would take the time to start by saying that these are nothing of the sort.  Defining the battleship is slightly tricky, but the best version I have is that it is a <a href="https://www.navalgazing.net/A-Brief-History-of-the-Battleship">large, gun-armed armored warship</a>.  This proposal is certainly large, but it doesn't really classify as gun-armed, in that the guns are clearly secondary weapons, and there's been no discussion of armor at all.  So whatever these are, they aren't battleships.  Their closest cousin is the Soviet <em>Kirov</em> class, which likewise are somewhat hard to classify, but in the <a href="https://www.navalgazing.net/The-Alaska-Class-Part-2">finest tradition of the USN</a>, I'm going to go with "Large Missile Cruiser" for these.  But the fact that they're being called by the wrong name, while personally extremely annoying, is just the tip of the iceberg.
</p>
<p><span> <img width="600" src="https://www.navalgazing.net/attach/DefiantSpecs.jpg?v=1766498855.jpg" alt=""></span></p>
<p>First, a look at the announced specs, as given above.  The dimensions are somewhat large given the displacement, as they're a pretty close match for <em>Iowa</em>, which is 50%+ heavier at full load, although they're also not too far from the <em>Alaska</em>s, of roughly the same displacement.  The length might make sense if they were going for nuclear power, because a very long hull would <a href="https://www.navalgazing.net/Ship-Resistance-and-Speed">minimize power requirements</a>, but it seems that it's <a href="https://www.navalgazing.net/Modern-Propulsion-Part-3" rel="nofollow">IEP</a> instead.  But then we get to armament, and things get weird.  It starts with the new ship-launched nuclear cruise missile that Trump has been pushing since his first term.  This is basically a replacement for the <a href="https://www.navalgazing.net/Tomahawk-Part-1">nuclear Tomahawk</a>, and whatever the logic for or against such a program might be, there's the problem that I'm pretty sure there's no need to have this new "battleship" to use the missile.  Details on the missile are very sketchy, but given that the base program is targeted at submarines, it probably can just go in the VLS with everything else.  If it can't that's a requirements problem, and we should change those instead of spending money on this thing.  I'm sure the crews will love it, too, given the need to guard the VLS all the time to avoid letting anyone know if there are actually nukes aboard.  
<a id="break"></a>
</p>
<p>Second, there are cells for Conventional Prompt Strike, which is the current hypersonic weapon that they're pushing.  It's not in service yet, and I'm <a href="https://www.navalgazing.net/Hypersonic-Weapons-Part-1">skeptical how much real value it will deliver</a>.  I'm also not entirely sure how many missiles will actually be aboard.  <em>Zumwalt</em> recently got four tubes in place of her forward gun, each of which carries three missiles, and I could see either four tubes/12 missiles or 12 tubes/36 missiles, with the latter maybe making more sense given the size of the ship.  The graphic provided by the Navy (below) is curiously unhelpful about this, almost like it was put together by someone who doesn't understand any of this stuff.
</p>
<p><span> <img width="600" src="https://www.navalgazing.net/attach/The_Golden_Fleet_USS_Defiant_Munitions-2048x1036.jpg?v=1766846152.jpg" alt=""> </span></p>
<p>Then there's 128 cells of <a href="https://www.navalgazing.net/VLS">VLS</a>, which is obviously the main armament of any surface warship in this day and age.  Now, this is almost exactly the same number of VLS cells carried by a <a href="https://www.navalgazing.net/The-Ticonderoga-Class"><em>Ticonderoga</em> class cruiser</a> on 10,000 tons,<a id="fnr1_1" href="#fn1_1"><sup>1</sup></a> which raises a fair number of questions about the efficiency of the design relative to a slightly stretched <a href="https://www.navalgazing.net/The-Arleigh-Burke-Class"><em>Burke</em></a> or any number of proposed designs that would be half the size of this thing.
</p>
<p>The secondary armament is even worse.  It starts with a railgun, which has become one of the perennial "next generation" weapons that never seems to get anywhere.  I remember reading about how cool they were going to be almost 20 years ago, and over the last few years, the program seems to have been basically cancelled.  The problem is that if you make an electrical explosion, it's sort of hard to stop it from eroding the rails, and nobody has been able to get a "barrel life" long enough to justify sticking it on a ship, even after investigating some rather amusing systems to change the rails in the field.  The 5" guns are fine, although putting them both forward is a bit odd, and I'm <a href="https://www.navalgazing.net/Lasers-at-Sea-Part-1">a big fan of lasers</a>.  The tertiary armament is even weirder.  <a href="https://www.navalgazing.net/RAM">RAM</a> makes sense as a backup for something like this, but the number of 30 mm guns is a bit odd given that they're basically for shooting and drones and small boats, and you already have lasers for that.  But better safe than sorry.  Then there's ODIN, which is a laser-based dazzler system.  And I'm sorry, but if you are going to put more lasers on, why not put on more full-size lasers?  They can also dazzle things you don't want to shoot down.  ODIN was developed for cases where you didn't have the power or (probably) integration to want a full-powered laser, but that isn't a problem here.  And then you have nebulous "counter UxS systems", which certainly hit current buzzwords, but otherwise leave us with no idea what they do.
</p>
<p><span> <img width="600" src="https://www.navalgazing.net/attach/Trump_Battleship_Poster_Battle_Hi-Res_v5-1-2048x1229.jpg?v=1766846147.jpg" alt=""><br><span>But look how pretty it is!  That's what matters, right?</span></span></p>
<p>On the whole, it's pretty clearly a grab-bag of stuff that sounded cool, thrown together without any real attempt to explain how is this better spending an equivalent amount of money on <em>Burke</em>s or on the DDG(X) program, which was going to come in around 15,000 tons, and which this is allegedly supposed to replace.  Apparently, a lot of this is driven because Trump thinks that modern ships are ugly, and should look good.  And I'm not entirely in disagreement with him on that.  I love a beautiful ship as much as anyone, but I also strive to keep my aesthetic judgements separate from my policy judgements.  I also think that there's some value in having good-looking ships when you're doing port visits and the like, and have even toyed with a "cheap capital ship" to be able to gain some of the benefits I discussed for <a href="https://www.navalgazing.net/Reactivation">the <em>Iowa</em>s in the 1980s</a>.  But that would not have been billed as the future of the Navy, more an interesting side project, and I'm far from sure it would actually be a good use of our limited defense budget.
</p>
<p>We've seen a similarly casual approach to procurement policy with the replacement for <em>Constellation</em>.  SecNav Phelan has announced that it will be a minimum-change version of the National Security Cutter design, with a flexible mission module slot added on and maybe <a href="https://www.navalgazing.net/RAM">RAM</a>, in hopes of getting in the water more quickly.  Now, they might actually be able to make "getting a ship launched by 2028" on this one, particularly if they're able to reuse components from the cutter <em>Friedman</em> (WMSL-760), which was cancelled back in July, with an unclear amount of work already done.  But the result will be something more much like the "minimum viable warship"/Type 31 than a true multi-role frigate, and we should be careful not to confuse the two.  In particular, even if the mission module slots get filled with VLS carrying, say, <a href="https://www.navalgazing.net/ESSM">ESSM</a>, the ship does not have the sort of radar necessary to be considered a serious air defense asset on the modern battlefield.  I gamed this out in Command: Modern Operations, which doubles as a mid-grade military simulation tool.  Both the new ship, apparently designated FF(X) and FFG-62 handled a salvo of 8 conventional C-802-type sea-skimming missiles without too much trouble.  But then I upped the threat to <a href="https://www.navalgazing.net/NSM">NSM</a> and things changed radically.  FFG-62 picked them up at 18.5 nm, just inside the radar horizon, and began firing at about 15 nm, with none of the missiles getting closer than 9.3 nm.  The NSC-based design, with its much worse radar, didn't pick them up until 3.7 nm, when it was too late to do anything other than a single RAM and a few ineffective shots from <a href="https://www.navalgazing.net/Phalanx">Phalanx</a> and the 57 mm gun.  NSC also has no onboard sonar system, although one based on the LCS version might be adaptable for use from the mission deck, at an obvious cost in air defense capability.  But it's "An American Design from an American Shipyard", so we're going to build it anyway, instead of more <em>Constellation</em>s.
</p>
<p><span> <img width="600" src="https://www.navalgazing.net/attach/USCGC_Midgett_arrives_to_Honolulu_for_first_time.jpg?v=1766846386.jpg" alt=""></span></p>
<p>I am also bothered by the name.  Not <em>Defiant</em>, which is a fine name for a warship, even if lacking in any particular heritage in the USN.  But calling the ships the Trump class is...  Look, I've been <a href="https://www.navalgazing.net/We-need-to-talk-about-ship-names">banging on about this for some time</a>, and naming things after someone who is not only alive but in office is just gross.  Also, a complete misunderstanding of how class names work in the American tradition.  The British sometimes will pick a theme name, but we just take the first-ordered ship of the class,<a id="fnr1_2" href="#fn1_2"><sup>2</sup></a> and use that.  So even if this does end up getting into the water, it will probably be as the <em>Defiant</em> class.  And I'm not hopeful for that happening.  This is pretty clearly a very early design, intended to cater to someone whose understanding of naval matters comes entirely from vague memories of Victory at Sea<a id="fnr1_3" href="#fn1_3"><sup>3</sup></a> and various yachts.  It's going to take years to turn it into something we can build, and its fate past 2028 is going to depend on whoever ends up winning that election, a subject I'm not competent to speculate on.
</p>
<p>The design is also pushing the limits of "steel is cheap and air is free", a doctrine I am usually a fierce partisan of.  I think that view is pretty straightforwardly true when you're talking about putting 4,000 tons of combat systems in a 6,000 ton hull.  But at some point, other factors start to take over.  There's a least a little bit of wisdom in the <a href="https://www.navalgazing.net/Types-82-and-42">Type 42 view</a> that if you have extra space, people will try to install stuff in it.  I was also worried about drydocking, but apparently, pretty much every drydock we have that supports DDGs also can handle LHDs, which are about the same size as this thing.  More importantly, even if this ship was considerably more capable than DDG(X), which it mostly isn't, it can only be in one place at a time, and we have a lot of commitments.  A ship in the wrong place isn't all that much better than no ship at all, so there are reasons to want numbers.
</p>
<p><span> <img width="600" src="https://www.navalgazing.net/attach/DefiantBB_NoText_Final2_forReal.png?v=1766846151.png" alt=""><br><span>Shas'ui made an excellent summary of the program on the Naval Gazing Discord</span></span></p>
<p>Ultimately, this entire thing is silly.  This is a ludicrously overgrown destroyer/cruiser (so far as those are separate things these days) without even a figleaf of justification for its size.  And even if there was some justification for the size, it definitely isn't a battleship.  Also, on a personal note, I would really appreciate it if the Administration stopped dropping significant naval news on the weeks of major holidays, because it adds something to my plate that I would rather not have to deal with.
