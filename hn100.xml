<p dir="auto">Writing modern apps are full of schleps. Most of the time you start with the server: stand up databases, caches, ORMs, and endpoints. Then you write client-side code: stores, selectors, mutators. Finally you paint a screen. If you add multiplayer you need to think about stateful servers, and if you support offline mode, you need to think about IndexedDB and transaction queues.</p>
<p dir="auto">To make things worse, whenever you add a new feature, you go through the same song and dance over and over again: add models, write endpoints, stores, selectors, and finally the UI.</p>
<p dir="auto">Could it be better?</p>
<p dir="auto">In 2021, <strong>we realized that most of the schleps we face as UI engineers are actually database problems problems in disguise.</strong> (We got into greater detail <a href="https://instantdb.com/essays/next_firebase" rel="nofollow">in this essay</a>)</p>
<p dir="auto">

</p>
<p dir="auto">If you had a database on the client, you wouldn't need to think about stores, selectors, endpoints, or local caches: just write queries. If these queries were multiplayer by default, you wouldn't have to worry about stateful servers. And if your database supported rollback, you'd get optimistic updates for free.</p>
<p dir="auto">So we built Instant. Instant gives you a database you can use in the client, so you can focus on what’s important: building a great UX for your users, and doing it quickly.</p>

<p dir="auto">For the frontend, we wrote a client-side triple store. The SDK handles persisting a cache of recent queries to IndexedDB on web, and AsyncStorage in React Native.</p>

When I joined AWS nearly 13 years ago, I entered a new domain—storage—and stepped into a new challenge. Even back then the scale of AWS dwarfed anything I had worked on, but many of the same techniques I had picked up until that point remained applicable—distilling problems down to first principles, and using successive iteration to incrementally solve problems and improve performance.</p><p>If you look around at AWS services today, you’ll find a mature set of core building blocks, but it wasn’t always this way. <a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2008/08/amazon_ebs_elastic_block_store.html">EBS launched on August 20, 2008</a>, nearly two years after EC2 became available in beta, with a simple idea to provide network attached block storage for EC2 instances. We had one or two storage experts, and a few distributed systems folks, and a solid knowledge of computer systems and networks. How hard could it be? In retrospect, if we knew at the time how much we didn’t know, we may not have even started the project!</p><p>Since I’ve been at EBS, I’ve had the opportunity to be part of the team that’s evolved EBS from a product built using shared hard disk drives (HDDs), to one that is capable of delivering hundreds of thousands of IOPS (IO operations per second) to a single EC2 instance. It’s remarkable to reflect on this because EBS is capable of delivering more IOPS to a single instance today than it could deliver to an entire Availability Zone (AZ) in the early years on top of HDDs. Even more amazingly, today EBS in aggregate delivers over 140 trillion operations daily across a distributed SSD fleet. But we definitely didn’t do it overnight, or in one big bang, or even perfectly. When I started on the EBS team, I initially worked on the EBS client, which is the piece of software responsible for converting instance IO requests into EBS storage operations. Since then I’ve worked on almost every component of EBS and have been delighted to have had the opportunity to participate so directly in the evolution and growth of EBS.</p><p>As a storage system, EBS is a bit unique. It’s unique because our primary workload is system disks for EC2 instances, motivated by the hard disks that used to sit inside physical datacenter servers. A lot of storage services place durability as their primary design goal, and are willing to degrade performance or availability in order to protect bytes. EBS customers care about durability, and we provide the primitives to help them achieve high durability with io2 Block Express volumes and volume snapshots, but they also care a lot about the performance and availability of EBS volumes. EBS is so closely tied as a storage primitive for EC2, that the performance and availability of EBS volumes tends to translate almost directly to the performance and availability of the EC2 experience, and by extension the experience of running applications and services that are built using EC2. The story of EBS is the story of understanding and evolving performance in a very large-scale distributed system that spans layers from guest operating systems at the top, all the way down to custom SSD designs at the bottom. In this post I’d like to tell you about the journey that we’ve taken, including some memorable lessons that may be applicable to your systems. After all, systems performance is a complex and really challenging area, and it’s a complex language across many domains.</p><h2 id="queueing-theory-briefly">Queueing theory, briefly <a href="#queueing-theory-briefly"></a></h2><p>Before we dive too deep, let’s take a step back and look at how computer systems interact with storage. The high-level basics haven’t changed through the years—a storage device is connected to a bus which is connected to the CPU. The CPU queues requests that travel the bus to the device. The storage device either retrieves the data from CPU memory and (eventually) places it onto a durable substrate, or retrieves the data from the durable media, and then transfers it to the CPU’s memory.</p><figure><img src="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/images/mo-computer-arch.png" alt="Architecture with direct attached disk" loading="lazy"><figcaption>High-level computer architecture with direct attached disk</figcaption></figure><p>You can think of this like a bank. You walk into the bank with a deposit, but first you have to traverse a queue before you can speak with a bank teller who can help you with your transaction. In a perfect world, the number of patrons entering the bank arrive at the exact rate at which their request can be handled, and you never have to stand in a queue. But the real world isn’t perfect. The real world is asynchronous. It’s more likely that a few people enter the bank at the same time. Perhaps they have arrived on the same streetcar or train. When a group of people all walk into the back at the same time, some of them are going to have to wait for the teller to process the transactions ahead of them.</p><p>As we think about the time to complete each transaction, and empty the queue, the average time waiting in line (latency) across all customers may look acceptable, but the first person in the queue had the best experience, while the last had a much longer delay. There are a number of things the bank can do to improve the experience for all customers. The bank could add more tellers to process more requests in parallel, it could rearrange the teller workflows so that each transaction takes less time, lowering both the total time and the average time, or it could create different queues for either latency insensitive customers or consolidating transactions that may be faster to keep the queue low. But each of these options comes at an additional cost—hiring more tellers for a peak that may never occur, or adding more real estate to create separate queues. While imperfect, unless you have infinite resources, queues are necessary to absorb peak load.</p><figure><img src="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/images/mo-simplified-ec2-ebs-queueing.png" alt="Simple diagram of EC2 and EBS queueing from 2012" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Simplified diagram of EC2 and EBS queueing (c. 2012)</figcaption></figure><p>In network storage systems, we have several queues in the stack, including those between the operating system kernel and the storage adapter, the host storage adapter to the storage fabric, the target storage adapter, and the storage media. In legacy network storage systems, there may be different vendors for each component, and different ways that they think about servicing the queue. You may be using a dedicated, lossless network fabric like fiber channel, or using iSCSI or NFS over TCP, either with the operating system network stack, or a custom driver. In either case, tuning the storage network often takes specialized knowledge, separate from tuning the application or the storage media.</p><p>When we first built EBS in 2008, the storage market was largely HDDs, and the latency of our service was dominated by the latency of this storage media. Last year, Andy Warfield went in-depth about the <a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2023/07/building-and-operating-a-pretty-big-storage-system.html#technical-scale-scale-and-the-physics-of-storage">fascinating mechanical engineering behind HDDs</a>. As an engineer, I still marvel at everything that goes into a hard drive, but at the end of the day they are mechanical devices and physics limits their performance. There’s a stack of platters that are spinning at high velocity. These platters have tracks that contain the data. Relative to the size of a track (&lt;100 nanometers), there’s a large arm that swings back and forth to find the right track to read or write your data. Because of the physics involved, the IOPS performance of a hard drive has remained relatively constant for the last few decades at approximately 120-150 operations per second, or 6-8 ms average IO latency. One of the biggest challenges with HDDs is that tail latencies can easily drift into the hundreds of milliseconds with the impact of queueing and command reordering in the drive.</p><p>We didn’t have to worry much about the network getting in the way since end-to-end EBS latency was dominated by HDDs and measured in the 10s of milliseconds. Even our early data center networks were beefy enough to handle our user’s latency and throughput expectations. The addition of 10s of microseconds on the network was a small fraction of overall latency.</p><p>Compounding this latency, hard drive performance is also variable depending on the other transactions in the queue. Smaller requests that are scattered randomly on the media take longer to find and access than several large requests that are all next to each other. This random performance led to wildly inconsistent behavior. Early on, we knew that we needed to spread customers across many disks to achieve reasonable performance. This had a benefit, it dropped the peak outlier latency for the hottest workloads, but unfortunately it spread the inconsistent behavior out so that it impacted many customers.</p><p>When one workload impacts another, we call this a “noisy neighbor.” Noisy neighbors turned out to be a critical problem for the business. As AWS evolved, we learned that we had to focus ruthlessly on a high-quality customer experience, and that inevitably meant that we needed to achieve strong performance isolation to avoid noisy neighbors causing interference with other customer workloads.</p><p>At the scale of AWS, we often run into challenges that are hard and complex due to the scale and breadth of our systems, and our focus on maintaining the customer experience. Surprisingly, the fixes are often quite simple once you deeply understand the system, and have enormous impact due to the scaling factors at play. We were able to make some improvements by changing scheduling algorithms to the drives and balancing customer workloads across even more spindles. But all of this only resulted in small incremental gains. We weren’t really hitting the breakthrough that truly eliminated noisy neighbors. Customer workloads were too unpredictable to achieve the consistency we knew they needed. We needed to explore something completely different.</p><h2 id="set-long-term-goals-but-dont-be-afraid-to-improve-incrementally">Set long term goals, but don’t be afraid to improve incrementally <a href="#set-long-term-goals-but-dont-be-afraid-to-improve-incrementally"></a></h2><p>Around the time I started at AWS in 2011, solid state disks (SSDs) became more mainstream, and were available in sizes that started to make them attractive to us. In an SSD, there is no physical arm to move to retrieve data—random requests are nearly as fast as sequential requests—and there are multiple channels between the controller and NAND chips to get to the data. If we revisit the bank example from earlier, replacing an HDD with an SSD is like building a bank the size of a football stadium and staffing it with superhumans that can complete transactions orders of magnitude faster. A year later we started using SSDs, and haven’t looked back.</p><p>We started with a small, but meaningful milestone: we built a new storage server type built on SSDs, and a new EBS volume type called Provisioned IOPS. Launching a new volume type is no small task, and it also limits the workloads that can take advantage of it. For EBS, there was an immediate improvement, but it wasn’t everything we expected.</p><p>We thought that just dropping SSDs in to replace HDDs would solve almost all of our problems, and it certainly did address the problems that came from the mechanics of hard drives. But what surprised us was that the system didn’t improve nearly as much as we had hoped and noisy neighbors weren’t automatically fixed. We had to turn our attention to the rest of our stack—the network and our software—that the improved storage media suddenly put a spotlight on.</p><p>Even though we needed to make these changes, we went ahead and launched in August 2012 with a maximum of 1,000 IOPS, 10x better than existing EBS standard volumes, and ~2-3 ms average latency, a 5-10x improvement with significantly improved outlier control. Our customers were excited for an EBS volume that they could begin to build their mission critical applications on, but we still weren’t satisfied and we realized that the performance engineering work in our system was really just beginning. But to do that, we had to measure our system.</p><h2 id="if-you-cant-measure-it-you-cant-manage-it">If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it <a href="#if-you-cant-measure-it-you-cant-manage-it"></a></h2><p>At this point in EBS’s history (2012), we only had rudimentary telemetry. To know what to fix, we had to know what was broken, and then prioritize those fixes based on effort and rewards. Our first step was to build a method to instrument every IO at multiple points in every subsystem—in our client initiator, network stack, storage durability engine, and in our operating system. In addition to monitoring customer workloads, we also built a set of canary tests that run continuously and allowed us to monitor impact of changes—both positive and negative—under well-known workloads.</p><p>With our new telemetry we identified a few major areas for initial investment. We knew we needed to reduce the number of queues in the entire system. Additionally, the Xen hypervisor had served us well in EC2, but as a general-purpose hypervisor, it had different design goals and many more features than we needed for EC2. We suspected that with some investment we could reduce complexity of the IO path in the hypervisor, leading to improved performance. Moreover, we needed to optimize the network software, and in our core durability engine we needed to do a lot of work organizationally and in code, including on-disk data layout, cache line optimization, and fully embracing an asynchronous programming model.</p><p>A really consistent lesson at AWS is that system performance issues almost universally span a lot of layers in our hardware and software stack, but even great engineers tend to have jobs that focus their attention on specific narrower areas. While the much celebrated ideal of a “full stack engineer” is valuable, in deep and complex systems it’s often even more valuable to create cohorts of experts who can collaborate and get really creative across the entire stack and all their individual areas of depth.</p><p>By this point, we already had separate teams for the storage server and for the client, so we were able to focus on these two areas in parallel. We also enlisted the help of the EC2 hypervisor engineers and formed a cross-AWS network performance cohort. We started to build a blueprint of both short-term, tactical fixes and longer-term architectural changes.</p><h2 id="divide-and-conquer">Divide and conquer <a href="#divide-and-conquer"></a></h2><figure><img src="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/images/mo-physalia.png" alt="Whiteboard showing how the team removed the contronl from from the IO path with Physalia" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Removing the control plane from the IO path with Physalia</figcaption></figure><p>When I was an undergraduate student, while I loved most of my classes, there were a couple that I had a love-hate relationship with. “Algorithms” was taught at a graduate level at my university for both undergraduates and graduates. I found the coursework intense, but I eventually fell in love with the topic, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/026204630X">Introduction to Algorithms</a>, commonly referred to as CLR, is one of the few textbooks I retained, and still occasionally reference. What I didn’t realize until I joined Amazon, and seems obvious in hindsight, is that you can design an organization much the same way you can design a software system. Different algorithms have different benefits and tradeoffs in how your organization functions. Where practical, Amazon chooses a divide and conquer approach, and keeps teams small and focused on a self-contained component with well-defined APIs.</p><p>This works well when applied to components of a retail website and control plane systems, but it’s less intuitive in how you could build a high-performance data plane this way, and at the same time improve performance. In the EBS storage server, we reorganized our monolithic development team into small teams focused on specific areas, such as data replication, durability, and snapshot hydration. Each team focused on their unique challenges, dividing the performance optimization into smaller sized bites. These teams are able to iterate and commit their changes independently—made possible by rigorous testing that we’ve built up over time. It was important for us to make continual progress for our customers, so we started with a blueprint for where we wanted to go, and then began the work of separating out components while deploying incremental changes.</p><p>The best part of incremental delivery is that you can make a change and observe its impact before making the next change. If something doesn’t work like you expected, then it’s easy to unwind it and go in a different direction. In our case, the blueprint that we laid out in 2013 ended up looking nothing like what EBS looks like today, but it gave us a direction to start moving toward. For example, back then we never would have imagined that Amazon would one day <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-nitro-ssd-high-performance-storage-for-your-i-o-intensive-applications/">build its own SSDs</a>, with a technology stack that could be tailored specifically to the needs of EBS.</p><h2 id="always-question-your-assumptions">Always question your assumptions! <a href="#always-question-your-assumptions"></a></h2><p>Challenging our assumptions led to improvements in every single part of the stack.</p><p>We started with software virtualization. Until late 2017 all EC2 instances ran on the Xen hypervisor. With devices in Xen, there is a ring queue setup that allows guest instances, or domains, to share information with a privileged driver domain (dom0) for the purposes of IO and other emulated devices. The EBS client ran in dom0 as a kernel block device. If we follow an IO request from the instance, just to get off of the EC2 host there are many queues: the instance block device queue, the Xen ring, the dom0 kernel block device queue, and the EBS client network queue. In most systems, performance issues are compounding, and it’s helpful to focus on components in isolation.</p><p>One of the first things that we did was to write several “loopback” devices so that we could isolate each queue to gauge the impact of the Xen ring, the dom0 block device stack, and the network. We were almost immediately surprised that with almost no latency in the dom0 device driver, when multiple instances tried to drive IO, they would interact with each other enough that the goodput of the entire system would slow down. We had found another noisy neighbor! Embarrassingly, we had launched EC2 with the Xen defaults for the number of block device queues and queue entries, which were set many years prior based on the limited storage hardware that was available to the Cambridge lab building Xen. This was very unexpected, especially when we realized that it limited us to only 64 IO outstanding requests for an entire host, not per device—certainly not enough for our most demanding workloads.</p><p>We fixed the main issues with software virtualization, but even that wasn’t enough. In 2013, we were well into the development of our first <a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2020/09/reinventing-virtualization-with-nitro.html">Nitro offload card</a> dedicated to networking. With this first card, we moved the processing of VPC, our software defined network, from the Xen dom0 kernel, into a dedicated hardware pipeline. By isolating the packet processing data plane from the hypervisor, we no longer needed to steal CPU cycles from customer instances to drive network traffic. Instead, we leveraged Xen’s ability to pass a virtual PCI device directly to the instance.</p><p>This was a fantastic win for latency and efficiency, so we decided to do the same thing for EBS storage. By moving more processing to hardware, we removed several operating system queues in the hypervisor, even if we weren’t ready to pass the device directly to the instance just yet. Even without passthrough, by offloading more of the interrupt driven work, the hypervisor spent less time servicing the requests—the hardware itself had dedicated interrupt processing functions. This second Nitro card also had hardware capability to handle EBS encrypted volumes with no impact to EBS volume performance. Leveraging our hardware for encryption also meant that the encryption key material is kept separate from the hypervisor, which further protects customer data.</p><figure><img src="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/images/mo-network-tuning.png" alt="Diagram showing experiments in network tuning to improve throughput and reduce latency" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Experimenting with network tuning to improve throughput and reduce latency</figcaption></figure><p>Moving EBS to Nitro was a huge win, but it almost immediately shifted the overhead to the network itself. Here the problem seemed simple on the surface. We just needed to tune our wire protocol with the latest and greatest data center TCP tuning parameters, while choosing the best congestion control algorithm. There were a few shifts that were working against us: AWS was experimenting with different data center cabling topology, and our AZs, once a single data center, were growing beyond those boundaries. Our tuning would be beneficial, as in the example above, where adding a small amount of random latency to requests to storage servers counter-intuitively reduced the average latency and the outliers due to the smoothing effect it has on the network. These changes were ultimately short lived as we continuously increased the performance and scale of our system, and we had to continually measure and monitor to make sure we didn’t regress.</p><p>Knowing that we would need something better than TCP, in 2014 we started laying the foundation for Scalable Relatable Diagram (SRD) with “<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9167399">A Cloud-Optimized Transport Protocol for Elastic and Scalable HPC</a>”. Early on we set a few requirements, including a protocol that could improve our ability to recover and route around failures, and we wanted something that could be easily offloaded into hardware. As we were investigating, we made two key observations: 1/ we didn’t need to design for the general internet, but we could focus specifically on our data center network designs, and 2/ in storage, the execution of IO requests that are in flight could be reordered. We didn’t need to pay the penalty of TCP’s strict in-order delivery guarantees, but could instead send different requests down different network paths, and execute them upon arrival. Any barriers could be handled at the client before they were sent on the network. What we ended up with is a protocol that’s useful not just for storage, but for networking, too. When used in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/11/elastic-network-adapter-ena-express-amazon-ec2-instances/">Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) Express</a>, SRD improves the performance of your TCP stacks in your guest. SRD can drive the network at higher utilization by taking advantage of multiple network paths and reducing the overflow and queues in the intermediate network devices.</p><p>Performance improvements are never about a single focus. It’s a discipline of continuously challenging your assumptions, measuring and understanding, and shifting focus to the most meaningful opportunities.</p><h2 id="constraints-breed-innovation">Constraints breed innovation <a href="#constraints-breed-innovation"></a></h2><p>We weren’t satisfied that only a relatively small number of volumes and customers had better performance. We wanted to bring the benefits of SSDs to everyone. This is an area where scale makes things difficult. We had a large fleet of thousands of storage servers running millions of non-provisioned IOPS customer volumes. Some of those same volumes still exist today. It would be an expensive proposition to throw away all of that hardware and replace it.</p><p>There was empty space in the chassis, but the only location that didn’t cause disruption in the cooling airflow was between the motherboard and the fans. The nice thing about SSDs is that they are typically small and light, but we couldn’t have them flopping around loose in the chassis. After some trial and error—and help from our material scientists—we found heat resistant, industrial strength hook and loop fastening tape, which also let us service these SSDs for the remaining life of the servers.</p><figure><img src="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/images/mo-manual-ssd.png" alt="An SSD in one of our servers" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Yes, we manually put an SSD into every server!</figcaption></figure><p>Armed with this knowledge, and a lot of human effort, over the course of a few months in 2013, EBS was able to put a single SSD into each and every one of those thousands of servers. We made a small change to our software that staged new writes onto that SSD, allowing us to return completion back to your application, and then flushed the writes to the slower hard disk asynchronously. And we did this with no disruption to customers—we were converting a propeller aircraft to a jet while it was in flight. The thing that made this possible is that we designed our system from the start with non-disruptive maintenance events in mind. We could retarget EBS volumes to new storage servers, and update software or rebuild the empty servers as needed.</p><p>This ability to migrate customer volumes to new storage servers has come in handy several times throughout EBS’s history as we’ve identified new, more efficient data structures for our on-disk format, or brought in new hardware to replace the old hardware. There are volumes still active from the first few months of EBS’s launch in 2008. These volumes have likely been on hundreds of different servers and multiple generations of hardware as we’ve updated and rebuilt our fleet, all without impacting the workloads on those volumes.</p><h2 id="reflecting-on-scaling-performance">Reflecting on scaling performance <a href="#reflecting-on-scaling-performance"></a></h2><p>There’s one more journey over this time that I’d like to share, and that’s a personal one. Most of my career prior to Amazon had been in either early startup or similarly small company cultures. I had built managed services, and even distributed systems out of necessity, but I had never worked on anything close to the scale of EBS, even the EBS of 2011, both in technology and organization size. I was used to solving problems by myself, or maybe with one or two other equally motivated engineers.</p><p>I really enjoy going super deep into problems and attacking them until they’re complete, but there was a pivotal moment when a colleague that I trusted pointed out that I was becoming a performance bottleneck for our organization. As an engineer who had grown to be an expert in the system, but also who cared really, really deeply about all aspects of EBS, I found myself on every escalation and also wanting to review every commit and every proposed design change. If we were going to be successful, then I had to learn how to scale myself–I wasn’t going to solve this with just ownership and bias for action.</p><p>This led to even more experimentation, but not in the code. I knew I was working with other smart folks, but I also needed to take a step back and think about how to make them effective. One of my favorite tools to come out of this was peer debugging. I remember a session with a handful of engineers in one of our lounge rooms, with code and a few terminals projected on a wall. One of the engineers exclaimed, “Uhhhh, there’s no way that’s right!” and we had found something that had been nagging us for a while. We had overlooked where and how we were locking updates to critical data structures. Our design didn’t usually cause issues, but occasionally we would see slow responses to requests, and fixing this removed one source of jitter. We don’t always use this technique, but the neat thing is that we are able to combine our shared systems knowledge when things get really tricky.</p><p>Through all of this, I realized that empowering people, giving them the ability to safely experiment, can often lead to results that are even better than what was expected. I’ve spent a large portion of my career since then focusing on ways to remove roadblocks, but leave the guardrails in place, pushing engineers out of their comfort zone. There’s a bit of psychology to engineering leadership that I hadn’t appreciated. I never expected that one of the most rewarding parts of my career would be encouraging and nurturing others, watching them own and solve problems, and most importantly celebrating the wins with them!</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion <a href="#conclusion"></a></h2><p>Reflecting back on where we started, we knew we could do better, but we weren’t sure how much better. We chose to approach the problem, not as a big monolithic change, but as a series of incremental improvements over time. This allowed us to deliver customer value sooner, and course correct as we learned more about changing customer workloads. We’ve improved the shape of the EBS latency experience from one averaging more than 10 ms per IO operation to consistent sub-millisecond IO operations with our highest performing io2 Block Express volumes. We accomplished all this without taking the service offline to deliver a new architecture.</p><p>We know we’re not done. Our customers will always want more, and that challenge is what keeps us motivated to innovate and iterate.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2023/07/building-and-operating-a-pretty-big-storage-system.html?utm_campaign=related+posts&amp;utm_source=brief-history-ebs">Building and operating a pretty big storage system called S3</a></li><li><a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2023/11/standing-on-the-shoulders-of-giants-colm-on-constant-work.html?utm_campaign=related+posts&amp;utm_source=brief-history-ebs">Reliability, constant work, and a good cup of coffee</a></li><li><a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2022/11/amazon-1998-distributed-computing-manifesto.html?utm_campaign=related+posts&amp;utm_source=brief-history-ebs">The Distributed Computing Manifesto</a></li></ul></span></section><hr></div></div>]]></description>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Beastie Boys have shared the story of how they discovered that the gold record plaque they received after the certification of ‘Paul’s Boutique’ didn’t actually contain a pressing of their own music.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The certification came when ‘Paul’s Boutique’ sold 500,000 copies just two months after its release. However, when the bandmates closely examined the plaque years later, they noticed that the record displayed inside did not contain the same amount of tracks as the album’s tracklisting.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>“So we’re at our studio here in California and I was smoking the pot,” Ad-Rock said, recalling the discovery. “This was a long time ago. We had a gold record on the wall, it was our record, ‘</span></span><span><span>Paul’s Boutique’</span></span><span><span>. I was looking at it and I could see it had our label and I could see that it had like nine songs on the one side. But I was looking at the actual gold record and it only had four songs on it.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Curious about the discrepancy, the band decided to break the glass and remove the record from the plaque.

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>When asked by O’Brien if this was common for all gold record plaques, Ad-Rock replied, “I don’t know about anybody else...” while Mike D speculated that major stars like Barbra Streisand or Donna Summer probably received plaques with their actual records.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>While the plaque didn’t feature their music, '</span></span><span><span>Paul’s Boutique'</span></span><span><span> continued to gain recognition after its gold certification.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div b-gj8cwnhyng=""><p>The .NET team has been working on a new experiment called async2, which is a new implementation of the async/await pattern that is designed to be more efficient and more flexible than the current implementation. It started with green threads and ended with an experiment that moves <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> to the runtime. This post will cover the journey of <code>async2</code> and the conclusion of the experiment.</p>
<h2 id="where-all-began-green-threads">Where all began - Green threads</h2>
<p>Let's start here: <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtimelab/issues/2398"><em>"Green Thread Experiment Results"</em></a>. The team invested in an experiment to evaluate the feasibility of using green threads in the .NET runtime. But wait a second, what are green threads?</p>
<h3 id="green-threads">Green threads</h3>
<p>Green threads are user-space threads that are managed by a runtime library or a virtual machine (VM) instead of the operating system.<sup>Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_thread">Wikipedia</a></sup> They are lightweight and can be created and managed more quickly than kernel threads. Green threads are also known as "coroutines" or "fibers" in other programming languages. The idea is that you, as a developer, don't have to worry about threads.</p>
<p>Currently, with threads and to some extend with <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>, a new stack is created. You can easily see that in your favourite IDE, if you debug:</p>
<p><img src="https://linkdotnetblog.azureedge.net/blog/20240812_Async2/stacks.webp" alt="stack"></p>
<p>Green threads are different. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/19098856/1892523">The memory of a green thread is allocated on the heap</a>. But all of this comes with a cost: As they aren't managed by the OS, they can't take advantage of multiple cores inherently. But for I/O-bound operations, they are a good fit.</p>
<h3 id="abandoning-green-threads">Abandoning green threads</h3>
<p>The key-challenges were (which lead to the abandonment of the green threads experiment):</p>
<ul>
<li>Complex interaction between green threads and existing async model</li>
<li>Interop with native code was complex and slower than using regular threads</li>
<li>Compatibility issues with security mitigations like shadow stacks</li>
<li>Uncertainty about whether it would be possible to make green threads faster than async in important scenarios, given the effort required for improvement.</li>
</ul>
<p>This lead to the conclusion that green threads are not the right way to go for the .NET runtime and gave birth to the <code>async2</code> experiment. From here on out, I will keep the term <code>async2</code> for the experiment, as it is the codename for the experiment.</p>
<h2 id="async2-the.net-runtime-async-experiment"><code>async2</code> - The .NET Runtime Async experiment</h2>
<p>Now, <code>async2</code> is obviously only a codename. The goal of the experiment was to move <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> to the runtime. The main motivation behind this was to make <code>async</code> more efficient and more flexible. As <code>async</code> is already used as an identifier in C#, the team decided to use <code>async2</code> as a codename for the experiment. <strong>If</strong> that thing ever makes it into the runtime, it will be called <code>async</code> - so it will be a replacement for the current <code>async</code> implementation. But let's start at the beginning.</p>
<h3 id="async-is-a-compiler-feature"><code>async</code> is a compiler feature</h3>
<p>I talked about this from time to time in my blog posts. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/720a48fd-0abe-4c32-83ac-26926d501895/the-state-machine-in-c-with-asyncawait"><em>"The state machine in C# with async/await"</em></a></li>
<li><a href="https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/69dc05d1-9c8a-4002-9d0a-faf4d2375bce/c-lowering"><em>"C# Lowering"</em></a></li>
</ul>
<p>The current implementation of <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> is a compiler feature. The compiler generates a state machine for the <code>async</code> method. The runtime doesn't know anything about <code>async</code> and <code>await</code>. There is no trace of an <code>async</code>-like keyword in IL or in the JIT-compiled code. And that is where the experiment started.</p>
<p>Starting point is this nice GitHub issue: <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/94620">"<em>.NET 9 Runtime Async Experiment</em>"</a>, which basically describes the whole experiment in more detail with an ongoing discussion from the community.</p>
<h3 id="async-is-a-runtime-feature"><code>async</code> is a runtime feature</h3>
<p>The goal of the experiment was to move <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> to the runtime. This would allow the runtime to have more control over the pattern itself. With that there would be also some different semantics:</p>
<h3 id="async2-and-executioncontext-and-synchronizationcontext"><code>async2</code> and <code>ExecutionContext</code> and <code>SynchronizationContext</code></h3>
<p><code>async2</code> would not have save or restore of <code>SynchronizationContext</code> and <code>ExecutionContext</code> at function boundaries, instead allowing callers to observe changes. With the <code>ExecutionContext</code>, this would shift a big change in how <code>AsyncLocal</code> behaves.</p>
<p>Today, <code>AsyncLocal</code> is used to store data that flows with the logical call context. It gets copied to the new context. That said, if a function deep down the call stack changes the value of an <code>AsyncLocal</code>, the caller will <strong>not</strong> see the updated value, only functions further down the logical async flow. Here an example:</p>
<pre><code>await new AsyncLocalTest().DoOuter();

public class AsyncLocalTest
{
    private readonly AsyncLocal&lt;string&gt; _asyncLocal = new();

    public async Task DoOuter()
    {
        _asyncLocal.Value = "Outer";
        Console.WriteLine($"DoOuter: {_asyncLocal.Value}");
        await DoInner();
        Console.WriteLine($"DoOuter: {_asyncLocal.Value}");
    }

    private async Task DoInner()
    {
        _asyncLocal.Value = "Inner";
        Console.WriteLine($"DoInner: {_asyncLocal.Value}");
        await Task.Yield();
        Console.WriteLine($"DoInner: {_asyncLocal.Value}");
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The output of this code is:</p>
<pre><code>DoOuter: Outer
DoInner: Inner
DoInner: Inner
DoOuter: Outer
</code></pre>
<p>With <code>async2</code> those changes are not "reverted" which would lead to a different output:</p>
<pre><code>DoOuter: Outer
DoInner: Inner
DoInner: Inner
DoOuter: Inner
</code></pre>

<p>The team found out that the approach of putting <code>async</code> into the JIT might yield the best results overall. Here a basic overview:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Feature</th>
<th><code>async</code></th>
<th><code>async2</code></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Performance</td>
<td>Generally slower than <code>async2</code>, especially for deep call stacks</td>
<td>Generally faster than <code>async</code>, with performance comparable to synchronous code in non-suspended scenarios</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Exception Handling</td>
<td>Slow and inefficient, causing GC pauses and impacting responsive performance of applications</td>
<td>Improved EH handling, reducing the impact on application responsiveness</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stack Depth Limitation</td>
<td>Limited by stack depth, which can cause issues for deep call stacks</td>
<td>No explicit limitations on stack depth, allowing <code>async2</code> to handle deeper call stacks more efficiently</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Memory Consumption</td>
<td>Generally lower than <code>async2</code>, especially in scenarios with many suspended tasks</td>
<td>Higher memory consumption due to capturing entire stack frames and registers, but still acceptable compared to other factors like pause times</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="where-do-we-go-from-here">Where do we go from here?</h2>
<p>As the name suggests, this is just an experiment, that may lead to a replacement of <code>async</code> <strong>in some years</strong>. Yes, <strong>years</strong>. It might take a while until this is production-ready. And for the transition phase, there has to be interop for <code>async</code> ↔ <code>async2</code>. Anyway - a very good starting point and I am looking forward to the future of <code>async2</code>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Short version: <a href="https://github.com/rhboot/shim/blob/main/SBAT.md">Secure Boot Advanced Targeting</a> and if that's enough for you you can skip the rest you're welcome.</p><p>Long version: When UEFI Secure Boot was specified, everyone involved was, well, a touch naive. The basic security model of Secure Boot is that all the code that ends up running in a kernel-level privileged environment should be validated before execution - the firmware verifies the bootloader, the bootloader verifies the kernel, the kernel verifies any additional runtime loaded kernel code, and now we have a trusted environment to impose any other security policy we want. Obviously people might screw up, but the spec included a way to revoke any signed components that turned out not to be trustworthy: simply add the hash of the untrustworthy code to a variable, and then refuse to load anything with that hash even if it's signed with a trusted key.</p><p>Unfortunately, as it turns out, scale. Every Linux distribution that works in the Secure Boot ecosystem generates their own bootloader binaries, and each of them has a different hash. If there's a vulnerability identified in the source code for said bootloader, there's a large number of different binaries that need to be revoked. And, well, the storage available to store the variable containing all these hashes is limited. There's simply not enough space to add a new set of hashes every time it turns out that grub (a bootloader initially written for a simpler time when there was no boot security and which has several separate image parsers and also a font parser and look you know where this is going) has another mechanism for a hostile actor to cause it to execute arbitrary code, so another solution was needed.</p><p>And that solution is SBAT. The general concept behind SBAT is pretty straightforward. Every important component in the boot chain declares a security generation that's incorporated into the signed binary. When a vulnerability is identified and fixed, that generation is incremented. An update can then be pushed that defines a minimum generation - boot components will look at the next item in the chain, compare its name and generation number to the ones stored in a firmware variable, and decide whether or not to execute it based on that. Instead of having to revoke a large number of individual hashes, it becomes possible to push one update that simply says "Any version of grub with a security generation below this number is considered untrustworthy".</p><p>So why is this suddenly relevant? SBAT was developed collaboratively between the Linux community and Microsoft, and Microsoft chose to push a Windows update that told systems not to trust versions of grub with a security generation below a certain level. This was because those versions of grub had genuine security vulnerabilities that would allow an attacker to compromise the Windows secure boot chain, and we've seen real world examples of malware wanting to do that (<a href="https://media.defense.gov/2023/Jun/22/2003245723/-1/-1/0/CSI_BlackLotus_Mitigation_Guide.PDF">Black Lotus</a> did so using a vulnerability in the Windows bootloader, but a vulnerability in grub would be just as viable for this). Viewed purely from a security perspective, this was a legitimate thing to want to do.</p><p>(An aside: the "Something has gone seriously wrong" message that's associated with people having a bad time as a result of this update? That's a message from <a href="https://github.com/rhboot/shim/">shim</a>, not any Microsoft code. Shim pays attention to SBAT updates in order to avoid violating the security assumptions made by other bootloaders on the system, so even though it was Microsoft that pushed the SBAT update, it's the Linux bootloader that refuses to run old versions of grub as a result. This is absolutely working as intended)</p><p>The problem we've ended up in is that several Linux distributions had not shipped versions of grub with a newer security generation, and so those versions of grub are assumed to be insecure (it's worth noting that grub is signed by individual distributions, not Microsoft, so there's no externally introduced lag here). Microsoft's stated intention was that Windows Update would only apply the SBAT update to systems that were Windows-only, and any dual-boot setups would instead be left vulnerable to attack until the installed distro updated its grub and shipped an SBAT update itself. Unfortunately, as is now obvious, that didn't work as intended and at least some dual-boot setups applied the update and that distribution's Shim refused to boot that distribution's grub.</p><p>What's the summary? Microsoft (understandably) didn't want it to be possible to attack Windows by using a vulnerable version of grub that could be tricked into executing arbitrary code and then introduce a bootkit into the Windows kernel during boot. Microsoft did this by pushing a Windows Update that updated the SBAT variable to indicate that known-vulnerable versions of grub shouldn't be allowed to boot on those systems. The distribution-provided Shim first-stage bootloader read this variable, read the SBAT section from the installed copy of grub, realised these conflicted, and refused to boot grub with the "Something has gone seriously wrong" message. This update was not supposed to apply to dual-boot systems, but did anyway. Basically:</p><p>1) Microsoft applied an update to systems where that update shouldn't have been applied<br>2) Some Linux distros failed to update their grub code and SBAT security generation when exploitable security vulnerabilities were identified in grub</p><p>The outcome is that some people can't boot their systems. I think there's plenty of blame here. Microsoft should have done more testing to ensure that dual-boot setups could be identified accurately. But also distributions shipping signed bootloaders should make sure that they're updating those and updating the security generation to match, because otherwise they're shipping a vector that can be used to attack other operating systems and that's kind of a violation of the social contract around all of this.</p><p>It's unfortunate that the victims here are largely end users faced with a system that suddenly refuses to boot the OS they want to boot. That should never happen. I don't think asking arbitrary end users whether they want secure boot updates is likely to result in good outcomes, and while I vaguely tend towards UEFI Secure Boot not being something that benefits most end users it's also a thing you really don't want to discover you want after the fact so I have sympathy for it being default on, so I do sympathise with Microsoft's choices here, other than the failed attempt to avoid the update on dual boot systems.</p><p>Anyway. I was extremely involved in the implementation of this for Linux back in 2012 and wrote the first prototype of Shim (which is now a massively better bootloader maintained by a wider set of people and that I haven't touched in years), so if you want to blame an individual please do feel free to blame me. This is something that shouldn't have happened, and unless you're either Microsoft or a Linux distribution it's not your fault. I'm sorry.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">Using Isaiah, you can manage multiple nodes with their own distinct Docker resources from a single dashboard.</p>
<p dir="auto">Before delving into that part, please get familiar with the general information below.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">General information</h3><a id="user-content-general-information" aria-label="Permalink: General information" href="#general-information"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You may find these information useful during your setup and reading :</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Isaiah distinguishes two types of nodes : <code>Master</code> and <code>Agent</code>.</li>
<li>The word <code>node</code> refers to any machine (virtual or not) holding Docker resources.</li>
<li>The <code>Master</code> node has three responsabilities :
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Serving the web interface.</li>
<li>Managing the Docker resources inside the environment on which it is already installed.</li>
<li>Acting as a central proxy between the client (you) and the remote Agent nodes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>Master</code> node has the following characteristics :
<ul dir="auto">
<li>There should be only one Master node in a multi-node deployment.</li>
<li>The Master node should be the only part of your deployment that is publicly exposed on the network.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>Agent</code> nodes have the following characteristics :
<ul dir="auto">
<li>They are headless instances of Isaiah, and they can't exist without a Master node.</li>
<li>As with the Master node, they have their own authentication if you don't disable it explicitly.</li>
<li>On startup, they perform registration with their Master node using as a Websocket client</li>
<li>For as long as the Master node is alive, a Websocket connection remains established between them.</li>
<li>The Agent node should never be publicly exposed on the network.</li>
<li>The Agent node never communicates with the client (you). Everything remains between the nodes.</li>
<li>There is no limit to how many Agent nodes can connect to a Master node.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In other words, one <code>Master</code> acts as a <code>Proxy</code> between the <code>Client</code> and the <code>Agents</code>.<br>
For example, when a <code>Client</code> wants to stop a Docker container inside an <code>Agent</code>, the <code>Client</code> first requests it from <code>Master</code>.
Then, <code>Master</code> forwards it to the designated <code>Agent</code>.
When the <code>Agent</code> has finished, they reply to <code>Master</code>, and <code>Master</code> forwards that response to the initial <code>Client</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Schematically, it looks like this :</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Client ------------&gt; Master : Stop container C-123 on Agent AG-777</li>
<li>Master ------------&gt; Agent  : Stop container C-123</li>
<li>Agent  ------------&gt; Master : Container C-123 was stopped</li>
<li>Master ------------&gt; Client : Container C-123 was stopped on Agent AG-777</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Now that we understand how everything works, let's see how to set up a multi-node deployment.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Setup</h3><a id="user-content-setup" aria-label="Permalink: Setup" href="#setup"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">First, please ensure the following :</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Your <code>Master</code> node is running, exposed on the network, and available in your web browser</li>
<li>Your <code>Agent</code> node has Isaiah installed and configured with the following settings :
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>SERVER_ROLE</code> equal to <code>Agent</code></li>
<li><code>MASTER_HOST</code> configured to reach the <code>Master</code> node</li>
<li><code>MASTER_SECRET</code> equal to the <code>AUTHENTICATION_SECRET</code> setting on the <code>Master</code> node, or empty when authentication is disabled</li>
<li><code>AGENT_NAME</code> equal to a unique string of your choice</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Then, launch Isaiah on each <code>Agent</code> node, and you should see logs indicating whether connection with <code>Master</code> was established. Eventually, you will see <code>Master</code> or <code>The name of your agent</code> in the lower right corner of your screen as agents register.</p>
<p dir="auto">If encounter any issue, please read the <a href="#troubleshoot">Troubleshoot</a> section.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">You may want to note that you don't need to expose ports on the machine / Docker container running Isaiah when it is configured as an Agent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Multi-host deployment</h2><a id="user-content-multi-host-deployment" aria-label="Permalink: Multi-host deployment" href="#multi-host-deployment"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Using Isaiah, you can manage multiple hosts with their own distinct Docker resources from a single dashboard.</p>
<p dir="auto">Before delving into that part, please get familiar with the general information below.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">General information</h3><a id="user-content-general-information-1" aria-label="Permalink: General information" href="#general-information-1"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The big difference between multi-node and multi-host deployments is that you won't need to install Isaiah on every single node
if you are using multi-host. In this setup, Isaiah is installed only on one server, and communicates with other Docker hosts
directly over TCP / Unix sockets. It makes it easier to manage multiple remote Docker environments without having to setup Isaiah
on all of them.</p>
<p dir="auto">Please note that, in a multi-host setup, there must be a direct access between the main host (where Isaiah is running)
and the other ones. Usually, they should be on the same network, or visible through a secured gateway / VPN / filesystem mount.</p>
<p dir="auto">Let's see how to set up a multi-host deployment.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Setup</h3><a id="user-content-setup-1" aria-label="Permalink: Setup" href="#setup-1"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In order to help you get started, a <a href="https://github.com/will-moss/isaiah/blob/master/app/sample.docker_hosts">sample file</a> was created.</p>
<p dir="auto">First, please ensure the following :</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Your <code>Master</code> host is running, exposed on the network, and available in your web browser</li>
<li>Your <code>Master</code> host has the setting <code>MULTI_HOST_ENABLED</code> set to <code>true</code>.</li>
<li>Your <code>Master</code> host has access to the other Docker hosts over TCP / Unix socket.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Second, please create a <code>docker_hosts</code> file next to Isaiah's executable, using the sample file cited above:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Every line should contain two strings separated by a single space.</li>
<li>The first string is the name of your host, and the second string is the path to reach it.</li>
<li>The path to your host should look like this : [PROTOCOL]://[URI]</li>
<li>Example 1 : Local unix:///var/run/docker.sock</li>
<li>Example 2 : Remote tcp://my-domain.tld:4382</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">If you're using Docker, you can mount the file at the root of the filesystem, as in :<br>
<code>docker ... -v my_docker_hosts:/docker_hosts ...</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Finally, launch Isaiah on the Master host, and you should see logs indicating whether connection with remote hosts was established.
Eventually, you will see <code>Master</code> with <code>The name of your host</code> in the lower right corner of your screen.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Forward Proxy Authentication / Trusted SSO</h2><a id="user-content-forward-proxy-authentication--trusted-sso" aria-label="Permalink: Forward Proxy Authentication / Trusted SSO" href="#forward-proxy-authentication--trusted-sso"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you wish to deploy Isaiah behind a secure proxy or authentication portal, you must configure Forward Proxy Authentication.</p>
<p dir="auto">This will enable you to :</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Log in, once and for all, into your authentication portal.</li>
<li>Connect to Isaiah without having to type your <code>AUTHENTICATION_SECRET</code> every time.</li>
<li>Protect Isaiah using your authentication proxy rather than the current mechanism (cleartext / hashed password).</li>
<li>Manage the access to Isaiah from your authentication portal rather than through your <code>.env</code> configuration.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Before proceeding, please ensure the following :</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Your proxy supports HTTP/2 and Websockets.</li>
<li>Your proxy can communicate with Isaiah on the network.</li>
<li>Your proxy forwards authentication headers to Isaiah (but not to the browser).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <br>
  For example, if you're using Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM), you should do the following :
  <ul dir="auto">
    <li>In the tab "Details"</li>

If this file exists, it will be loaded in your browser and it will override any existing CSS rule.</p>
<p dir="auto">In order to help you get started, a <a href="https://github.com/will-moss/isaiah/blob/master/app/sample.custom.css">sample file</a> was created.

<p dir="auto">On a side note, creating custom layouts using only CSS isn't implemented yet as it requires interaction with Javascript.
That said, implementing this feature should be quick and simple since the way layouts are managed currently is already modular.</p>
<p dir="auto">Ultimately, please note that Isaiah already comes with three themes : dawn, moon, and the default one.
The first two themes are based on Rosé Pine, and new themes may be implemented later.</p>

<p dir="auto">Should you encounter any issue running Isaiah, please refer to the following common problems with their solutions.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Isaiah is unreachable over HTTP / HTTPS</h4><a id="user-content-isaiah-is-unreachable-over-http--https" aria-label="Permalink: Isaiah is unreachable over HTTP / HTTPS" href="#isaiah-is-unreachable-over-http--https"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Please make sure that the following requirements are met :</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">If Isaiah runs as a standalone application without proxy :</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Make sure your server / firewall accepts incoming connections on Isaiah's port.</li>
<li>Make sure your DNS configuration is correct. (Usually, such record should suffice : <code>A isaiah XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX</code> for <code>https://isaiah.your-server-tld</code>)</li>
<li>Make sure your <code>.env</code> file is well configured according to the <a href="#configuration">Configuration</a> section.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If Isaiah runs on Docker :</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Perform the previous (standalone) verifications first.</li>
<li>Make sure you mounted your server's Docker Unix socket onto the container that runs Isaiah (/var/run/docker.sock)</li>
<li>Make sure your Docker container is accessible remotely</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If Isaiah runs behind a proxy :</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Perform the previous (standalone) verifications first.</li>
<li>Make sure that <code>SERVER_PORT</code> (Isaiah's port) are well set in <code>.env</code>.</li>
<li>Check your proxy forwarding rules.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In any case, the crucial part is <a href="#configuration">Configuration</a> and making sure your Docker / Proxy setup is correct as well.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The emulated shell behaves unconsistently or displays unexpected characters</h4><a id="user-content-the-emulated-shell-behaves-unconsistently-or-displays-unexpected-characters" aria-label="Permalink: The emulated shell behaves unconsistently or displays unexpected characters" href="#the-emulated-shell-behaves-unconsistently-or-displays-unexpected-characters"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Please note that the emulated shell works by performing the following steps :</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Open a headless terminal on the remote server / inside the remote Docker container.</li>
<li>Capture standard output, standard error, and bind standard input to the web interface.</li>
<li>Display standard output and standard error on the web interface as they are streamed over Websocket from the terminal.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">According to this implementation, the remote terminal never receives key presses. It only receives commands.</p>
<p dir="auto">Also, the following techniques are used to try to enhance the user experience on the web interface :</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Enable clearing the shell (HTML) screen via "Ctrl+L" (while the real terminal remains untouched)</li>
<li>Enable quitting the (HTML) shell via "Ctrl+D" (by sending an "exit" command to the real terminal)</li>
<li>Handle "command mirror" by appending "# ISAIAH" to every command sent by the user (to distinguish it from command output)</li>
<li>Handle both "\r" and "\n" newline characters</li>
<li>Use a time-based approach to detect when a command is finished if it doesn't output anything that shows clear ending</li>
<li>Remove all escape sequences meant for coloring the terminal output</li>
<li>Handle up and down arrow keys to cycle through commands history locally</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Therefore it appears that, unless we use a VNC-like solution, the emulation can neither be enhanced nor use keyboard-based features (such as tab completion).</p>
<p dir="auto">Unless a contributor points the project in the right direction, and as far as my skills go, I personally believe that the current implementation has reached its maximum potential.</p>
<p dir="auto">I leave here a few ideas that I believe could be implemented, but may require more knowledge, time, testing :</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Convert escape sequences to CSS colors</li>
<li>Wrap every command in a "block" (begin - command - end) to easily distinguish user-sent commands from output</li>
<li>Sending to the real terminal the key presses captured from the web (a.k.a sending key presses to a running process)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Ultimately, please also note that in a multi-node / multi-host setup, the extra network latency and unexpected buffering from remote terminals may cause additional display artifacts.</p>

<p dir="auto">Also, please note that if you have deployed Isaiah using Docker, trying to open a system shell (<code>S</code> key) will not work.

<p dir="auto">This is a known incident that happens when the Websocket server receives a data message that exceeds its maximum read size.
You should be able to fix that by updating the <code>SERVER_MAX_READ_SIZE</code> setting to a higher value (default is 100,000 bytes).
This operation shouldn't cause any problem or impact performances.</p>

<p dir="auto">This incident arises when a crash occurs while inside a shell or performing a Docker command.
The quickest "fix" for that is to refresh your browser tab (Ctrl+R/Cmd+R).</p>
<p dir="auto">The real "fix" (if any) could be to implement a "timeout" (client-side or server-side) after which, the "loading" state is automatically discarded</p>
<p dir="auto">If you encounter this incident consistently, please reach out by opening an issue so we look deeper into that part</p>

<p dir="auto">If you haven't already, please read about the <code>SERVER_MAX_READ_SIZE</code> setting in the <a href="#configuration">Configuration</a> section.</p>
<p dir="auto">That incident occurs when the Websocket messages sent from the client to the server are too big.
The server's reaction to overly large messages sent over Websocket is to close the connection with the client.
When that happens, Isaiah (as a client in your browser) automatically reopens a connection with the server, hence explaining the "crash-restart" cycle.</p>

<p dir="auto">Due to the very nature of Isaiah, I can't emphasize enough how important it is to harden your server :</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Always enable the authentication (with <code>AUTHENTICATION_ENABLED</code> and <code>AUTHENTICATION_SECRET</code> settings) unless you have your own authentication mechanism built into a proxy.</li>
<li>Always use a long and secure password to prevent any malicious actor from taking over your Isaiah instance.</li>
<li>You may also consider putting Isaiah on a private network accessible only through a VPN.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Keep in mind that any breach or misconfiguration on your end could allow a malicious actor to fully take over your server.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Disclaimer</h2><a id="user-content-disclaimer" aria-label="Permalink: Disclaimer" href="#disclaimer"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I believe that, although we're both in the open-source sphere and have all the best intentions, it is important to state the following :</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Isaiah isn't a competitor or any attempt at replacing the lazydocker project. Funnily enough, I'm myself more comfortable running lazydocker through SSH rather than in a browser.</li>
<li>I've browsed almost all the open issues on lazydocker, and tried to implement and improve what I could (hence the <code>TTY_CONTAINER_COMMAND</code> variable, as an example, or even the Image pulling feature).</li>
<li>Isaiah was built from absolute zero (for both the server and the client), and was ultimately completed using knowledge from lazydocker that I'm personally missing (e.g. the container states and icons).</li>
<li>Before creating Isaiah, I tried to "serve lazydocker over websocket" (trying to send keypresses to the lazydocker process, and retrieving the output via Websocket), but didn't succeed, hence the full rewrite.</li>
<li>I also tried to start Isaiah from the lazydocker codebase and implement a web interface on top of it, but it seemed impractical or simply beyond my skills, hence the full rewrite.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Ultimately, thanks to the people behind lazydocker both for the amazing project (that I'm using daily) and for paving the way for Isaiah.</p>
<p dir="auto">PS : Please also note that Isaiah isn't exactly 100% feature-equivalent with lazydocker (e.g. charts are missing)
PS2 : What spurred me to build Isaiah in the first place is a bunch of comments on the Reddit self-hosted community, stating that Portainer and other available solutions were too heavy or hard to use. A Redditor said that having lazydocker over the web would be amazing, so I thought I'd do just that.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Contribute</h2><a id="user-content-contribute" aria-label="Permalink: Contribute" href="#contribute"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This is one of my first ever open-source projects, and I'm not a Docker / Github / Docker Hub / Git guru yet.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you can help in any way, please do! I'm looking forward to learning from you.</p>
<p dir="auto">From the top of my head, I'm sure there's already improvement to be made on :</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Terminology (using the proper words to describe technical stuff)</li>
<li>Coding practices (e.g. writing better comments, avoiding monkey patches)</li>
<li>Shell emulation (e.g. improving on what's done already)</li>
<li>Release process (e.g. making explicit commits, pushing Docker images properly to Docker Hub)</li>
<li>Github settings (e.g. using discussions, wiki, etc.)</li>
<li>And more!</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Credits</h2><a id="user-content-credits" aria-label="Permalink: Credits" href="#credits"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Hey hey ! It's always a good idea to say thank you and mention the people and projects that help us move forward.</p>
<p dir="auto">Big thanks to the individuals / teams behind these projects :</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker">laydocker</a> : Isaiah wouldn't exist if Lazydocker hadn't been created prior, and to say that it is an absolutely incredible and very advanced project is an understatement.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><a href="http://modelviewculture.com/pieces/i-didn-t-want-to-lean-out">I decided to leave what had been a promising career in organic chemistry</a> about a year ago. Deciding to leave my program, and then to leave the field entirely, was one of the hardest decisions I have made. I had more resources than many in my position: savings and financial support, enough work experience to feel confident that I was making a realistic decision, and supportive friends and mentors. Still, that decision meant that I lost my plans, my confidence in my career trajectory, and my identity as a practicing scientist.</p>
<p>One of my biggest losses was a clear(ish) path forward. In chemistry, and particularly in academia, your mentors and your observations help you form a mental career map of sorts. Undergrad (graduation) leads to a bench job or graduate school (the latter may be much like that bench job, but with worse management and less compensation); the bench job leads to a dead end (in Big Pharma, at least), an “alternate career path”, or to graduate school. Graduate school traditionally leads to academia, industry, or work at national labs (or that “alternate career path”). Academia has the postdoc-to-postdoc-to-tenure track path; “industry” covers a lot of territory, but there is an expectation of moving either laterally or vertically within and between various companies (<a href="http://chemjobber.blogspot.com/">assuming there are jobs</a>); and similarly, there are opportunities for career progress and moving up the ladder in national labs. None of these are easy paths, of course, but I was surrounded by the institutional knowledge that they were possible.</p>
<p>When I left, I left the territory that my maps covered. That same institutional knowledge whispered that leaving a program is failing; that “alternate career paths” are well and good for those who couldn’t hack it on the “normal” paths; that a master’s degree is an admission of inferiority, not a proud acheivement. I had never judged my friends and partners who had left their own programs and changed fields, but it was somehow different when it was me.</p>
<p>Humans aren’t very good with change. We create meaning around the stress and soften transitions with rituals and rites of passage. Each of the change-points on the map I described would have been marked with a ritual: graduations, heading to happy hour after quals, the <a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/faq-the-snake-fight-portion-of-your-thesis-defense">ritual challenge</a> of the <a href="http://xkcd.com/1403/">thesis defense</a> and the addition of “Dr.” to one’s full name, a handshake and congratulations on a raise or promotion, ordering business cards with a new title, heading to lunch with coworkers when a new coworker arrives or when one leaves for grad school, going through the arcane and labryinthine process of setting up accounts and office space at a new institution. We go through rituals to enter a program, and the process of graduate school itself is arguably a rite of passage that culminates in a final challenge, renaming, and shared food and drink. There is nothing to smooth the process of choosing to leave.</p>
<p>When I made my final decision to leave, I could feel what I was losing and that I needed to mourn. My grandmother had died at the beginning of the year, so grief, and irreversible change were already on my mind. My family grieved by coming together to share food, drink, stories, and ritual. None of those elements need to be restricted to mourning a death. I wanted the support of my community for this loss as well. </p>
<p>I invited my friends to a wake of sorts. No one ended up coming in mourning wear, but a dear friend brought me funeral lilies with a sheepish expression and that set the tone for the evening. We ate, we drank, and we chatted. Eventually I talked a bit about the choice I’d made, why I’d invited them, and my hopes for my future. My friends shared their hopes, reassurances, and anger on my behalf and their own wishes. I led a series of toasts and curses for what I’d been through and what I wished were different. I acknowledged what I had gotten from that part of my life. I cried for what I’d experienced and what I’d lost.</p>
<p>Those of us who leave the paths “everyone” knows are no less brave and resourceful than those who follow them. I’ve posted the invitation I sent out for the “wake” I held below the cut. If you think that anything I’ve shared here might help you navigate your own changes, please take whatever is helpful, change it to fit you, and pass it on. We can map and mark our new paths together.</p>
<p><span id="more-140"></span><br>
Greetings, all:</p>
<p>You are formally invited to</p>
<p>A WAKE</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>THE RESEARCH SCIENCE CAREER</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>FRANCES HOCUTT</p>
<p>FRIDAY from 7 PM to MIDNIGHT</p>
<p>I have decided to permanently leave the UW chemistry department and,<br>
most likely, the field of organic chemistry. This is a significant<br>
personal loss. I have been interested in and good at organic chemistry<br>
for the last decade and had been planning to use those skills in a<br>
research career to figure out more about the world and change it for<br>
the better with SCIENCE! I have finally decided that the culture of<br>
the field is too toxic for me to want to continue and I have chosen to<br>
leave to pursue other interests.</p>
<p>You are all invited to help me mourn this loss, to celebrate the good<br>
things I’ll be taking forward from it, and to look ahead at where I’m<br>
going next. I will provide: delicious coconut lentil curry with rice,<br>
caramel sauce and chocolate ganache to put on things, and a few<br>
beverages (alcoholic and not). Please bring some combination of: food,<br>
board games, delightful music, projects to work on, more delicious<br>
beverages, things to put caramel on, and your awesome selves. Kids are<br>
welcome but please be aware there are cats and my house is not<br>
kid-proofed. Please do not bring foods with peanuts or tree nuts in<br>
them.</p>
<p>I ask that those of you currently connected to the chemistry<br>
department keep this information private. I am still trying to work<br>
some things out with the department and would prefer to handle<br>
informing people there myself.</p>
<p>Please do RSVP so I can get a rough head-count, but feel free to show<br>
up at any time during the evening. Dressing in your personal version<br>
of mourning wear, the more over-the-top the better, is highly<br>
encouraged but not required.</p>
<p>Frances</p>

	<h2 itemprop="subheading">Timeless timepiece, both functional and comfortable</h2>
	
	<p>Last month a very special package arrived from Switzerland, containing my custom made wrist watch. I decided to sell all my big brand watches and have them replaced by something unique, tailored to my personal preferences. This is the story of my watch.</p>

	<a name="continue" id="continue"></a>
	<h3>Watches</h3><p>There is something magical in these miniature machines that sit on peoples' wrists: watches. They are technical marvels that often are much more than mere tools to tell time. </p><p>Some are status symbols, some are pieces of art, some are fitness tools and others are digital companions. But most of all, a watch is something truly personal: you wear it on<i> your</i> body. With smartphones and computers everywhere, nobody really needs a watch to tell time. Wearing a watch is a deliberate choice, one I like to carefully consider.</p><a name="Some of my watches over the years" title="Some of my watches over the years" href="https://willem.com/blog/2020-11-30_designing-my-own-watch/images/i_00_Some-of-my-watches-over-the-years_3000px.png"><figure><img alt="Some of my watches over the years" src="https://willem.com/blog/2020-11-30_designing-my-own-watch/images/i_00_Some-of-my-watches-over-the-years_500px.png" srcset="https://willem.com/blog/2020-11-30_designing-my-own-watch/images/i_00_Some-of-my-watches-over-the-years_500px.png 500w,

            <div>
                <h2 id="simd-in-game-development">SIMD in game development</h2>
<p>Often in game development we talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data">SIMD</a>. It is the holy grail of CPU performance, often out of reach. The conventional wisdom is that it is difficult to achieve real gains from SIMD.</p>
<p>It is tempting to build a math library around SIMD hoping to get some performance gains. However, it often has no proven benefit. It just feels good to be using something we know <em>can</em> improve performance. But sometimes SIMD can get in the way.</p>
<p>For example, game play programmers often do a lot of piecemeal vector math. They are not chopping 8 carrots at once. Instead they are trying to get a movement ability to work well on the player. Like swinging on a rope or swimming in water. These require vector math, but this code cannot be gathered into SIMD instructions in a meaningful way. We cannot force a game to have 8 players swinging on a rope at the same time.</p>
<p>Game physics is often similar. The user wants to create or destroy a single body. The ray casts are issued from the game separately and point in different directions.</p>
<p>Even if there are many similar things being computed, it can be difficult to gather these objects and push them through some algorithm simultaneously. For example, in game physics one of the most expensive computations is computing the contact forces between colliding bodies. When there are many bodies there can be a huge number of contact points.</p>
<p>This large pyramid has 5050 bodies and a whopping 14950 contact pairs, each with two contact points. Each contact point has a non-penetration force and a friction force. That is 59800 forces to be computed! Further these forces need to be computed several times per time step as part of the <em>Soft Step</em> solver. Read more <a href="https://box2d.org/posts/2024/02/solver2d/">here</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://box2d.org/images/large_pyramid_benchmark.png" alt="Large Pyramid"><em>A pyramid of 5050 bodies</em></p>
<p>Another problem is that each constraint operates on different bodies. So even if constraints are organized contiguously in an array for faster iteration, the bodies need to be randomly accessed. This random access is the ultimately the bottleneck in game physics.</p>
<h2 id="graph-coloring">Graph coloring</h2>
<p>For Box2D version 3.0 I decided to finally try using SIMD as it is <strong>meant to be used</strong> for solving contacts. Making contacts solve faster could yield large performance gains so I decided it would be worth the effort.</p>
<p>But how can I gather 4 or 8 contact pairs to be solved simultaneously? The key is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring">graph coloring</a>. The idea is to have a handful of colors to be assigned to all the contact constraints. For example, suppose I have 6 colors and I want to assign all the contacts to one of those 6 colors. Contact constraints act upon two bodies at a time. With graph coloring the restriction is that within a single color a body can only appear once or not at all.</p>
<p>This small pyramid shows an example of graph coloring. Each contact constraint has two contact points with the same color. There are four colors: red, orange, yellow, and green. If you look at a color, such as orange, you can see that it only touches a box once per contact point pair. This is the magic of graph coloring and enables me to solve multiple contact constraints simultaneously without a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition">race condition</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://box2d.org/images/graph_color_small.png" alt="Graph Coloring"><em>Graph coloring of a small pyramid</em></p>
<p>Graph coloring can scale to very large scenarios. The image below shows the graph coloring of the contact points on the large pyramid. You can see in the text the number of contact constraints per color.</p>
<ul>
<li>color 1 : 2524</li>
<li>color 2 : 2508</li>
<li>color 3 : 2465</li>
<li>color 4 : 2376</li>
<li>color 5 : 2286</li>
<li>color 6 : 2107</li>
<li>color 7 : 652</li>
<li>color 8 : 32</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://box2d.org/images/graph_color.png" alt="Large Pyramid Graph Coloring"><em>Graph coloring of the large pyramid</em></p>
<p>These colors group together constraints that can be solved simultaneously using SIMD. For example, color 1 has 2524 contact constraints. Each of these constraints is between two bodies. The graph coloring ensures that none of the same bodies appear more than once in all 2524 contact constraints. This means all 2524 constraints can be solved simultaneously.</p>
<p>But isn’t graph coloring very complex and slow? Contacts come and go all the time in rigid body simulation. Do I need to recompute the graph colors every time a contact is added or removed?</p>
<p>First of all, there is a lot of intimidating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem">theory</a> around graph coloring and it seems at first that some complex algorithms must be applied to do graph color properly. This is not true at all! A simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm">greedy algorithm</a> is sufficient for game physics.</p>
<p>Box2D maintains a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_array">bitsets</a> for each graph color. Each bit corresponds to a body index. When a contact constraint is created, the graph color bitsets are examined. The constraint is assigned to the first color with a bitset that doesn’t have either body bit set to 1. Once the constraint is assigned to a color, those two body bits are set to 1. This is a very fast operation.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span><span>void</span> <span>b2AddContactToGraph</span>(b2ConstraintGraph<span>*</span> graph, b2Contact<span>*</span> contact)

</span></span><span><span>        }

</span></span><span><span>        {

</span></span><span><span>    }
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Even though bitsets are fast, it would be better not to redo the graph coloring every time step. So Box2D persists the graph coloring across time steps. When a contact constraint is created the color is determined and the body bits are turned on. When a constraint is removed the corresponding two body bits are cleared.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span><span>void</span> <span>b2RemoveContactFromGraph</span>(b2ConstraintGraph<span>*</span> graph, b2Contact<span>*</span> contact)

</span></span><span><span>    <span>b2ClearBit</span>(color<span>-&gt;</span>bodySet, contact<span>-&gt;</span>bodyIndexB);
</span></span><span><span>    contact<span>-&gt;</span>colorIndex <span>=</span> B2_NULL_INDEX;
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>There are a couple more details. When bodies go to sleep they are removed from the graph coloring and when they wake they are added back according to the constraints that connect them. Also static bodies are never set in the bitsets because static bodies are not modified by the contact solver. This reduces the number of colors needed.</p>
<h2 id="going-wide">Going WIDE</h2>
<p>So now that I have 2524 contact constraints I can solve simultaneously, how do I do that? Well there are no SIMD units that are 2524 floats wide. So I break these into 4 or 8 constraint blocks (SSE2/Neon or AVX2). These <em>wide</em> constraints can be solved like a single scalar constraint. The math looks almost identical.</p>
<p>There is some delicate plumbing needed to make this happen. In particular, I need to gather 4 or 8 pairs of bodies for each wide constraint. I gather the body velocities and put them in <em>wide</em> floats (4 or 8 floats).</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span><span>// wide float
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>typedef</span> b2FloatW <span>__m128</span>;
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>// wide vector
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>struct</span> b2Vec2W
</span></span><span><span>{
</span></span><span><span>    b2FloatW X;
</span></span><span><span>    b2FloatW Y;
</span></span><span><span>};
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>// wide body
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>struct</span> b2BodyW
</span></span><span><span>{
</span></span><span><span>    b2Vec2W linearVelocity;
</span></span><span><span>    b2FloatW angularVelocity;
</span></span><span><span>};
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I grab 4 or 8 bodies and stuff their velocities into a single <em>wide</em> body. Then the wide constraint operates on wide bodies and all the math looks similar to scalar math. For example, the wide dot product is just two multiplications and one addition, doing 4 or 8 dot products simultaneously.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span><span>// wide dot product
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>b2FloatW <span>b2DotW</span>(b2Vec2W a, b2Vec2W b)
</span></span><span><span>{
</span></span><span><span>    <span>return</span> <span>b2AddW</span>(<span>b2MulW</span>(a.X, b.X), <span>b2MulW</span>(a.Y, b.Y));
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is the way SIMD is <strong>meant to be used</strong>. But there is sure a lot of setup work to make this possible!</p>
<p>After the wide constraint is solved, the wide body velocities are <em>scattered</em> to the individual scalar bodies. These <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gather/scatter_(vector_addressing)">gather/scatter</a> operations are needed to make this all work. Each instruction set SSE2/Neon/AVX2 has custom instructions that help with this. None of it is super intuitive but it is well documented not too difficult to setup.</p>
<h2 id="does-it-matter">Does it matter?</h2>
<p>I did all this work to enable SIMD processing. Did it help? Box2D has a benchmarking console application to help answer this question. I implemented SSE2, Neon, and AVX SIMD instruction sets in the Box2D contact solver. I also implemented a <strong>scalar</strong> reference implementation. I have 5 benchmarks scenarios that push Box2D in various ways. See the benchmark results <a href="https://box2d.org/files/benchmark_results.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>I ran these benchmarks on an AMD 7950X (AVX2, SSE2, scalar) and an Apple M2 (Neon).</p>
<p><img src="https://box2d.org/images/large_pyramid_results.png" alt="Large Pyramid Results"><em>Large pyramid benchmark results</em></p>
<p>The joint grid benchmark doesn’t use SIMD instructions at all, so you can ignore that one. But the other ones all stress the contact solver.</p>
<p>The large pyramid benchmark with 4 workers has the following numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>AVX2 : 1117 fps = 0.90 ms</li>
<li>Neon : 1058 fps = 0.95 ms</li>
<li>SSE2 : 982 fps = 1.02 ms</li>
<li>scalar (AMD): 524 fps = 1.91 ms</li>
<li>scalar (M2): 679 fps = 1.47 ms</li>
</ul>
<p>From this I draw the following conclusions:</p>
<ol>
<li>SSE2 is about 2x faster than scalar</li>
<li>AVX2 is about 14% faster than SSE2</li>
<li>The Apple M2 smokes!</li>
</ol>
<p>Another consideration is that all collision is done with scalar math. So more gains could be made if I figure out how to use SIMD for collision as well.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that making good use of SIMD can be a lot of work but it is worth the effort because it can make games run significantly faster and handle more rigid bodies.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-compiler-vectorization">What about compiler vectorization?</h2>
<p>An interesting side result from this experiment relates to compiler vectorization. In my scalar reference implementation I defined the wide float as a structure of 4 floats.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span><span>// wide float for reference scalar implementation
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>struct</span> b2FloatW { <span>float</span> x, y, z, w };
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I also implemented all the wide math functions to work with this. It seems that I have arranged all the data perfectly for the compiler to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_vectorization">automatic vectorization</a>. But it seems this doesn’t really happen to a sufficient degree to compete with my hand written SSE2. This is a bit ironic because on x64 all math <strong>is</strong> SIMD math, it is just inefficient SIMD math.</p>

While asking questions in various groupchats, it didn’t take too long to see that lots of other people were demanding similar tools — and would be willing to pay for them. Pretty soon after that realization, I had some API endpoints set up where people could access the data for free and submit trades for a small commission.</p><p id="3136">I started getting a few customers, a very cool experience since this was the first time people were paying for software I built myself! I started a Telegram channel for feature announcements and support, which worked well at first. But, as my customer base slowly grew, support began taking up more and more of my time. I know this is the case for any SAAS startup, so the increasing support burden was hardly a surprise, and, after all, more customers is a good problem to have! What became irritating was not the quantity, but the quality of the support requests I was receiving.</p><p id="ad0b">My API is just a few well documented endpoints. If you can figure out how to send a POST request using any programming language, you should have no problem using it. But that seems to be too high a bar for the new generation of prompt-engineer coders. Since opening my support channel, I have fielded many a “Help! My trading bot is not working!!” support request. More often than not, I will be sent customer code that is mostly fine, but has some error that should be glaringly obvious to anyone who has read the documentation and has some programming ability. Often this takes the form of trying to access an endpoint that does not exist, or read a property off the API response that does not exist. After probing a bit more, my suspicions are usually confirmed — ChatGPT hallucinated that endpoint or property, and the customer I’m talking to has little to no programming knowledge. If they are just trying to build a simple script I’ll help them out, and fix the hallucinations — it’s not much effort and creates a potentially paying customer. Often, though, the customer is envisioning a more complex application, and I just have to tell them, “Sorry, you’re going to have to hire a professional developer for this.” The worst is when a request starts out simple — I help them fix one hallucination — but then that customer wants to build more complex logic, and somehow I’ve set the expectation that I will provide unlimited free support forever. I’ve gotten a number of angry messages from customers who essentially want me to build their whole app for free.</p><p id="2841">I’m sure these challenges sound familiar to anyone who has run support for a SAAS business, but AI programming tools have exacerbated the problem. Helping a customer solve challenges is often super rewarding, but only when I can remove roadblocks for customers who can do most of the work themselves. When customers offload software engineering to AI because they don’t have the capability themselves, they still need to find a developer to fix the bugs that AI creates. I don’t want to be that developer!</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What we would today call <em>cash assistance for the differently abled</em> could in a different era permissibly have been called <em>welfare for cripples</em>. The terms <em>welfare</em> and <em>crippled</em> sound somewhere between loaded and abusive today, and yet once were considered civil by educated, sensitive people. There actually was an organisation called the International Society for the Welfare of Cripples established in 1922.</p>
<p>However, in 1960 it was retitled the International Society for the Rehabilitation of the Disabled. As appropriate as that seems from our vantage point, it demonstrated a general tendency towards which we often roll our eyes. ‘Okay, what are we supposed to call it now?’ we sometimes think, as terms considered proper for a group or phenomenon seem to change every generation or so. The implication is that we find this rolling terminology a bit much – why can’t the names of things just stay put? On <em>disabled</em>, for example, what was wrong with <em>handicapped</em>, and why must we now move on to <em>differently abled</em>? Isn’t all of this kind of like Puff Daddy to P Diddy?</p>
<p>No, actually. What the cognitive psychologist and linguist Steven Pinker has artfully termed ‘the euphemism treadmill’ is not a tic or a stunt. It is an inevitable and, more to the point, healthy process, necessary in view of the eternal gulf between language and opinion. We think of euphemisms as one-time events, where one prissily coins a way of saying something that detracts from something unpleasant about it. That serves perfectly well as a definition of what euphemism is, but misses the point that euphemism tends to require regular renewal. This is because thought changes more slowly than we can change the words for it, and has a way of catching up with our new coinages. Since that is likely eternal, we must accept that we’ll change our terms just like we change our underwear, as a part of linguistic life in a civilised society.</p>
<p><span>T</span>he reason for this rolling semantic renewal is that the meanings of words are, in actual usage, messier than their dictionary definitions, cast in the tidy eternity of print, might make them seem. We store words in our brains amid webs of association, with experiences, impressions and other words. As a result, a word is always redolent of various associations, metaphorical extensions, beyond its core meaning.</p>
<p>For example, <em>generous</em> once meant noble, with no connection to sharing. It’s what William Shakespeare meant when he used the term. So when Edmund in <em>King Lear</em> defends himself against dismissal as low-born by insisting that</p>
<blockquote>… my dimensions are as well compact,<br>My mind as generous, and my shape as true,<br>As honest madam’s issue</blockquote>
<p>it can throw us a bit, making us wonder how a mind can be generous, and we find it a bit curious that someone would defend himself against a charge of bastardy by pointing out his magnanimity. However, in earlier societies, the noble person was often responsible for a degree of charity to the ordinary population, such that magnanimity was a trait associated with nobility. Over time, especially as formal nobility itself had ever less importance (think of the fate of the Crawleys in <em>Downton Abbey</em>), the meaning of <em>magnanimity</em> changed from a resonance of <em>generous</em> to the meaning it has today.</p>
<p>A word, then, is like a bell tone, with a central pitch seasoned by overtones. As the tone fades away, the overtones can hang in the air. Words are similar, with opinion, assumption and, more to the point, bias as equivalents to the overtones. <em>Crippled</em> began as a sympathetic term. However, a sad reality of human society is that there are negative associations and even dismissal harboured against those with disabilities. Thus <em>crippled</em> became accreted with those overtones, so to speak, to the point that <em>handicapped</em> was fashioned as a replacement term free from such baggage.</p>
<p>what a warm, charitable word <em>welfare</em> is at its core, and how much static and bile we must peel away to hear it that way again</p>
<p>However, because humans stayed human, it was impossible that <em>handicapped</em> would not, over time, become accreted with similar gunk. Enter <em>disabled</em>, which is now long-lived enough that many process it, too, as harbouring shades of abuse, which conditions a replacement such as <em>differently abled</em>. Notably, the International Society for the Rehabilitation of the Disabled later changed its name again to Rehabilitation, International; today, the organisation prefers to be known simply as ‘RI’, bypassing the inconvenience of actual words altogether. The story has been similar for <em>retarded</em> being replaced by <em>cognitively impaired</em>; for <em>welfare</em>, which today is more often referred to as <em>cash assistance</em>; or by the faceless initials of programmes disbursing it, such as TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families).</p>
<p>Opinion can permeate a euphemism to such an extent that it becomes difficult to conceive of how it once sounded. <em>Welfare</em> was a replacement for what was once commonly referred to as <em>home relief</em>. The empathy in that term was soon blunted by associations with the people granted relief, such that older generations will recall <em>home relief</em> practically uttered as a negative epithet by the 1950s and ’60s. Meanwhile, reflect on what a warm, charitable word <em>welfare</em> is at its core, and how much static and bile we must peel away to hear it that way again. Similar is <em>affirmative action</em>: a term that 50 years ago resounded with a clean, stalwart clang of high-minded social justice now sounds freighted, sour, vague and tired to many on both sides of the political spectrum. <em>Racial preferences</em> was an attempt at a replacement – and note its similar fate.</p>
<p>As a lad decades ago, I worked briefly in the production of a magazine about <em>family planning</em>. Unfamiliar with the terminology, I spent months in this job before fully understanding that <em>family planning</em> referred to contraception, not just people musing over when they ‘planned’ to have children. Why the obliqueness? Because <em>family planning</em> was a replacement euphemism for <em>birth control</em>, coined in 1914 by the US contraception activist Margaret Sanger. Note that <em>birth control</em> was in itself as elliptical and abstract a terminology as <em>family planning.</em> Yet today, <em>birth control</em> summons the concrete image of a contraceptive pill or other device. It was inevitable that this would become the case for <em>birth control</em> given the controversy over its use.</p>
<p>This sheds light on the linguist George Lakoff’s briefly acclaimed proposal during the George W Bush administration that Democrats could regain influence by changing the terms for things reviled by Republicans. Taxes could be <em>membership fees</em>; trial lawyers could be <em>public protection attorneys</em>. As fresh as this idea seemed, it could have only worked temporarily, as the history of words such as <em>welfare</em> demonstrates. The nature of language and humanity is such that, after about 20 years, those criticising taxation rates would have come to process and discuss ‘membership fees’ with the same contempt with which they once discussed ‘taxes’, just as it has got to the point that <em>custodian</em> now has roughly the same feel as <em>janitor</em>, for which it emerged as a euphemism in the 1940s. <em>Custodian</em> makes one think not of ‘custody’ but of a mop.</p>
<p><span>T</span>hought will always catch up with the word. Make no mistake, the thoughts can be ones that many would consider welcome. A hundred years ago, in industry, <em>efficiency</em> was associated with the ‘scientific management’ theories of Frederick Taylor, the US mechanical engineer and one of the first management consultants, in search of the maximum output from factory labourers. However, as this kind of efficiency often led to the need for fewer workers, a question arose as to whom the efficiency was intended most to benefit.</p>
<p>Today, <em>efficiency</em> carries a faintly minatory air, in contrast to its first neutral, and then glamorous, feel as the 20th century got underway. <em>Downsizing</em>, an attempt to euphemise the dismissal of workers for the purposes of the bottom line, rapidly lost any impartial connotation it was crafted to purvey. In the mid-20th century, <em>urban renewal</em> was a term of art for what on the ground displaced millions of Americans, often from low-income but stable neighbourhoods deemed ‘slums’ and razed down. Today, that reality has been aired amply and publicly, such that <em>urban renewal</em> calls to mind a bulldozer mowing down innocent people’s homes. Notably, there seems to be no replacement term for <em>urban renewal</em>, partly because the policies of urban czars such as New York’s city planner Robert Moses have been so thoroughly repudiated that public officials no longer espouse any similar doctrine. Ultimately, words alone cannot do this: <em>urban renewal</em> itself began as a euphemism for the more direct <em>slum clearance</em>, but the practice only burgeoned for decades thereafter. It took thought changing to truly transform.</p>
<p>‘Innovation’ has been fashionable for long enough among corporate and political types that it has taken on their hucksterish associations</p>
<p>The euphemism treadmill, then, is neither just a form of bureaucratese, nor of identity politics. It is a symptom of the fact that, however much we would like it to be otherwise, it’s easier to change language than to change thought. Moreover, the euphemism treadmill is neither new nor does it churn faster than it once did. When you ask someone <em>Where’s the men’s?,</em> you are using a replacement for the <em>restroom</em> that can summon a vision of a certain undersanitised room in the back of a Wendy’s fast-food restaurant. Yet the very idea of it being a ‘rest’ room began as an exquisite attempt to wave away miasmic associations after <em>bathroom</em> ceased to do the job any better than had <em>toilet</em> or <em>lavatory</em>, deflecting attention to grooming and cleansing over what else happens in the room. Historically, <em>lavatory</em> is first attested in 1864, <em>restroom</em> followed hot on its heels a few decades later, at the turn of the 20th century, and then <em>men’s room</em> came into fashion in the 1920s.</p>
<p>This means that, in a linguistically mature society, we should expect that the terms we introduce to help us kick off new ways of thinking will require periodic replacement, like tyres. In our moment, <em>special-needs student</em> would appear about due for a swap-out. Meanwhile, the term <em>innovation</em> has been fashionable for just long enough among corporate and political types that it has taken on their hucksterish associations. <em>Invention</em>, for their purposes, would be better, although by about 2035 we can assume that this word too will sound, from the mouths of that era’s managers and mayors, equally fulsome.</p>
<p>Reality persists. It’s language we have control over – at least, for a while.</p></div></div>]]></description>
