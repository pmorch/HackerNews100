<p>Pressure is mounting on tech companies to shield users from unlawful government requests that advocates say are making it harder to reliably share information about Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) online.</p>
<p>Alleging that ICE officers are being doxed or otherwise endangered, Trump officials have spent the last year targeting an unknown number of users and platforms with demands to censor content. Early lawsuits show that platforms have caved, even though experts say they could refuse these demands without a court order.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.thefire.org/sites/default/files/2026/02/Verified%20Complaint%20-%20Rosado%20v.%20Bondi.pdf">lawsuit</a> filed on Wednesday, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) accused Attorney General Pam Bondi and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem of coercing tech companies into removing a wide range of content “to control what the public can see, hear, or say about ICE operations.”</p>
<p>It’s the second lawsuit alleging that Bondi and DHS officials are using regulatory power to pressure private platforms to suppress speech protected by the First Amendment. It follows a complaint <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/iceblock-lawsuit-trump-admin-bragged-about-demanding-app-store-removal/">from the developer of an app called ICEBlock</a>, which Apple removed from the App Store in October. Officials aren’t rushing to resolve that case—last month, they requested more time to respond—so it may remain unclear until March what defense they plan to offer for the takedown demands.</p>
<p>That leaves community members who monitor ICE in a precarious situation, as critical resources could disappear at the department’s request with no warning.</p>
<p>FIRE says people have legitimate reasons to share information about ICE. Some communities focus on helping people avoid dangerous ICE activity, while others aim to hold the government accountable and raise public awareness of how ICE operates. Unless there’s proof of incitement to violence or a true threat, such expression is protected.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
            
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Despite the high bar for censoring online speech, lawsuits trace an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/instagram-user-fights-dhs-for-the-right-to-post-ice-sightings-anonymously/">escalating pattern</a> of DHS increasingly targeting websites, app stores, and platforms—many that have been willing to remove content the government dislikes.</p>
<p>Officials have ordered <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/apple-bends-to-trump-admin-demand-to-remove-ice-tracking-apps-like-iceblock/">ICE-monitoring apps to be removed from app stores</a> and even <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.285233/gov.uscourts.dcd.285233.1.0_1.pdf">threatened to sanction CNN</a> for simply reporting on the existence of one such app. Officials have also demanded that Meta delete at least one Chicago-based Facebook group with 100,000 members and made <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/instagram-ice-critic-wins-fight-to-stay-anonymous-as-dhs-backs-down/">multiple unsuccessful attempts</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/trump-admin-pressured-facebook-into-removing-ice-tracking-group/">unmask anonymous users behind other Facebook groups</a>. Even encrypted apps like Signal don’t feel safe from officials’ seeming overreach. FBI Director Kash Patel recently said he has opened an investigation into Signal chats used by Minnesota residents to track ICE activity, NBC News&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/fbi-investigating-minnesota-signal-minneapolis-group-ice-patel-kash-rcna256041" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>.</p>
<p>As DHS censorship threats increase, platforms have done little to shield users, advocates say. Not only have they sometimes failed to reject unlawful orders that simply provided a “a bare mention of ‘officer safety/doxing'” as justification, but in one case, Google complied with a subpoena that left a critical section blank, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/open-letter-tech-companies-must-resist-unlawful-subpoenas-user-data">reported</a>.</p>
<p>For users, it’s increasingly difficult to trust that platforms won’t betray their own policies when faced with government intimidation, advocates say. Sometimes platforms notify users before complying with government requests, giving users a chance to challenge potentially unconstitutional demands. But in other cases, users learn about the requests only as platforms comply with them—even when those platforms have promised that would never happen.</p>
<h2>Government emails with platforms may be exposed</h2>
<p>Platforms could face backlash from users if lawsuits expose their communications to the government, a possibility in the coming months. Last fall, the EFF sued after DOJ, DHS, ICE, and Customs and Border Patrol failed to respond to Freedom of Information Act requests seeking emails between the government and platforms about takedown demands. Other lawsuits may surface emails in discovery. In the coming weeks, a judge will set a schedule for EFF’s litigation.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>“The nature and content of the Defendants’ communications with these technology companies” is “critical for determining whether they crossed the line from governmental cajoling to unconstitutional coercion,” EFF’s <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/EFF-v-DOJ-Complaint-11-20-25.pdf">complaint</a> said.</p>
<p>EFF Senior Staff Attorney Mario Trujillo told Ars that the EFF is confident it can win the fight to expose government demands, but like most FOIA lawsuits, the case is expected to move slowly. That’s unfortunate, he said, because ICE activity is escalating, and delays in addressing these concerns could irreparably harm speech at a pivotal moment.</p>

<p>Like users, platforms are seemingly victims, too, FIRE senior attorney Colin McDonnell told Ars.</p>
<p>They’ve been forced to override their own editorial judgment while navigating implicit threats from the government, he said.</p>
<p>“If Attorney General Bondi demands that they remove speech, the platform is going to feel like they have to comply; they don’t have a choice,” McDonnell said.</p>
<p>But platforms do have a choice and could be doing more to protect users, the EFF has said. Platforms could even serve as a first line of defense, requiring officials to get a court order before complying with any requests.</p>
<p>Platforms may now have good reason to push back against government requests—and to give users the tools to do the same. Trujillo noted that while courts have been slow to address the ICEBlock removal and FOIA lawsuits, the government has quickly withdrawn requests to unmask Facebook users soon after litigation began.</p>
<p>“That’s like an acknowledgement that the Trump administration, when actually challenged in court, wasn’t even willing to defend itself,” Trujillo said.</p>
<p>Platforms could view that as evidence that government pressure only works when platforms fail to put up a bare-minimum fight, Trujillo said.</p>

<h2>Platforms “bend over backward” to appease DHS</h2>
<p>An <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/open-letter-tech-companies-must-resist-unlawful-subpoenas-user-data">open letter</a> from the EFF and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) documented two instances of tech companies complying with government demands without first notifying users.</p>
<p>The letter called out Meta for unmasking at least one user without prior notice, which groups noted “potentially” occured due to a “technical glitch.”</p>
<p>More troubling than buggy notifications, however, is the possibility that platforms may be routinely delaying notice until it’s too late.</p>
<p>After Google “received an ICE subpoena for user data and fulfilled it on the same day that it notified the user,” the company admitted that “sometimes when Google misses its response deadline, it complies with the subpoena and provides notice to a user at the same time to minimize the delay for an overdue production,” the letter said.</p>
<p>“This is a worrying admission that violates [Google’s] clear promise to users, especially because there is no legal consequence to missing the government’s response deadline,” the letter said.</p>
<p>Platforms face no sanctions for refusing to comply with government demands that have not been court-ordered, the letter noted. That’s why the EFF and ACLU have urged companies to use their “immense resources” to shield users who may not be able to drop everything and fight unconstitutional data requests.</p>
<p>In their letter, the groups asked companies to insist on court intervention before complying with a DHS subpoena. They should also resist DHS “gag orders” that ask platforms to hand over data without notifying users.</p>
<p>Instead, they should commit to giving users “as much notice as possible when they are the target of a subpoena,” as well as a copy of the subpoena. Ideally, platforms would also link users to legal aid resources and take up legal fights on behalf of vulnerable users, advocates suggested.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
            
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>That’s not what’s happening so far. Trujillo told Ars that it feels like “companies have bent over backward to appease the Trump administration.”</p>
<p>The tide could turn this year if courts side with app makers behind crowdsourcing apps <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/iceblock-lawsuit-trump-admin-bragged-about-demanding-app-store-removal/">like ICEBlock</a> and Eyes Up, who are suing to end the alleged government coercion. FIRE’s McDonnell, who represents the creator of Eyes Up, told Ars that platforms may feel more comfortable exercising their own editorial judgment moving forward if a court declares they were coerced into removing content.</p>
<h2>DHS can’t use doxing to dodge First Amendment</h2>
<p>FIRE’s lawsuit accuses Bondi and Noem of coercing Meta to disable a Facebook group with 100,000 members called “ICE Sightings–Chicagoland.”</p>
<p>The popularity of that group surged during “Operation Midway Blitz,” when hundreds of agents arrested more than 4,500 people over weeks of raids that used tear gas in neighborhoods and caused car crashes and other violence. Arrests included US citizens and immigrants of lawful status, which “gave Chicagoans reason to fear being injured or arrested due to their proximity to ICE raids, no matter their immigration status,” FIRE’s complaint said.</p>

<p>Kassandra Rosado, a lifelong Chicagoan and US citizen of Mexican descent, started the Facebook group and served as admin, moderating content with other volunteers. She prohibited “hate speech or bullying” and “instructed group members not to post anything threatening, hateful, or that promoted violence or illegal conduct.”</p>
<p>Facebook only ever flagged five posts that supposedly violated community guidelines, but in warnings, the company reassured Rosado that “groups aren’t penalized when members or visitors break the rules without admin approval.”</p>
<p>Rosado had no reason to suspect that her group was in danger of removal. When Facebook disabled her group, it told Rosado the group violated community standards “multiple times.” But her complaint noted that, confusingly, “Facebook policies don’t provide for disabling groups if a few members post ostensibly prohibited content; they call for removing groups when the group moderator repeatedly either creates prohibited content or affirmatively ‘approves’ such content.”</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
            
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Facebook’s decision came after a right-wing influencer, Laura Loomer, tagged Noem and Bondi in a social media post alleging that the group was “getting people killed.” Within two days, Bondi bragged that she had gotten the group disabled while claiming that it “was being used to dox and target [ICE] agents in Chicago.”</p>
<p>McDonnell told Ars it seems clear that Bondi selectively uses the term “doxing” when people post images from ICE arrests. He pointed to “ICE’s own social media accounts,” which share favorable opinions of ICE alongside videos and photos of ICE arrests that Bondi doesn’t consider doxing.</p>
<p>“Rosado’s creation of Facebook groups to send and receive information about where and how ICE carries out its duties in public, to share photographs and videos of ICE carrying out its duties in public, and to exchange opinions about and criticism of ICE’s tactics in carrying out its duties, is speech protected by the First Amendment,” FIRE argued.</p>
<p>The same goes for speech managed by Mark Hodges, a US citizen who resides in Indiana. He created an app called Eyes Up to serve as an archive of ICE videos. Apple removed Eyes Up from the App Store around the same time that it removed ICEBlock.</p>
<p>“It is just videos of what government employees did in public carrying out their duties,” McDonnell said. “It’s nothing even close to threatening or doxing or any of these other theories that the government has used to justify suppressing speech.”</p>
<p>Bondi bragged that she had gotten ICEBlock banned, and FIRE’s complaint confirmed that Hodges’ company received the same notification that ICEBlock’s developer got after Bondi’s victory lap. The notice said that Apple received “information” from “law enforcement” claiming that the apps had violated Apple guidelines against “defamatory, discriminatory, or mean-spirited content.”</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
            
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Apple did not reach the same conclusion when it independently reviewed Eyes Up prior to government meddling, FIRE’s complaint said. Notably, the app remains available in Google Play, and Rosado now manages a new Facebook group with similar content but somewhat tighter restrictions on who can join. Neither activity has required urgent intervention from either tech giants or the government.</p>
<p>McDonnell told Ars that it’s harmful for DHS to water down the meaning of doxing when pushing platforms to remove content critical of ICE.</p>
<p>“When most of us hear the word ‘doxing,’ we think of something that’s threatening, posting private information along with home addresses or places of work,” McDonnell said. “And it seems like the government is expanding that definition to encompass just sharing, even if there’s no threats, nothing violent. Just sharing information about what our government is doing.”</p>
<p>Expanding the definition and then using that term to justify suppressing speech is concerning, he said, especially since the First Amendment includes no exception for “doxing,” even if DHS ever were to provide evidence of it.</p>
<p>To suppress speech, officials must show that groups are inciting violence or making true threats. FIRE has alleged that the government has not met “the extraordinary justifications required for a prior restraint” on speech and is instead using vague doxing threats to discriminate against speech based on viewpoint. They’re seeking a permanent injunction barring officials from coercing tech companies into censoring ICE posts.</p>
<p>If plaintiffs win, the censorship threats could subside, and tech companies may feel safe reinstating apps and Facebook groups, advocates told Ars. That could potentially revive archives documenting thousands of ICE incidents and reconnect webs of ICE watchers who lost access to valued feeds.</p>
<p>Until courts possibly end threats of censorship, the most cautious community members are moving local ICE-watch efforts to group chats and listservs that are harder for the government to disrupt, Trujillo told Ars.</p>

    <h2>Vim 9.2 is available</h2>
    <p><img src="https://www.vim.org/images/vim92_logo.svg" width="500">
    </p>
    <p>The Vim project is happy to announce that Vim 9.2 has been released.</p>
    <p>Vim 9.2 brings significant enhancements to the Vim9 scripting language, improved diff mode, comprehensive completion features, and platform-specific improvements including experimental Wayland support.</p>

    <h2>New Features in Vim 9.2</h2>
    <ul>
	<li><strong>Comprehensive Completion:</strong> Added support for <strong>fuzzy matching</strong> during insert-mode completion and the ability to complete words directly from <strong>registers</strong> (<code>CTRL-X CTRL-R</code>). New <code>'completeopt'</code> flags like <code>nosort</code> and <code>nearest</code> offer finer control over how matches are displayed and ordered.</li>
	
	<li><strong>Modern Platform Support:</strong> Full support for the <strong>Wayland</strong> UI and clipboard has been added. On Linux and Unix-like systems, Vim now adheres to the <strong>XDG Base Directory Specification</strong>, using <code>$HOME/.config/vim</code> for user configuration.</li>
	
	<li><strong>UI Enhancements:</strong> A new <strong>vertical tabpanel</strong> provides an alternative to the horizontal tabline. The <strong>MS-Windows</strong> GUI now supports native dark mode for the menu and title bars, along with improved fullscreen support and higher-quality toolbar icons.</li>
	
	<li><strong>Interactive Learning:</strong> A new built-in <strong>interactive tutor plugin</strong> (started via <code>:Tutor</code>) provides a modernized learning experience beyond the traditional vimtutor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Vim9 Script Evolution</h2>
    <p>Significant language enhancements including native support for <strong>Enums</strong>, <strong>Generic functions</strong>, and the <strong>Tuple</strong> data type. Built-in functions are now integrated as <strong>object methods</strong>, and classes now support protected <code>_new()</code> methods and <code>:defcompile</code> for full method compilation.</p>

    <div>
	<h2>Vim9 Script Ecosystem &amp; AI Integration</h2>
	<p>The maturity of Vim9 script's modern constructs is now being leveraged by advanced AI development tools. Contributor Yegappan Lakshmanan recently demonstrated the efficacy of these new features through two projects generated using GitHub Copilot:</p>

	<ul>
	    <li><strong>Battleship in Vim9:</strong> A complete implementation of the classic game, showcasing classes and type aliases. [<a href="https://github.com/yegappan/battleship.git">GitHub</a>]</li>
	    <li><strong>Number Puzzle:</strong> A logic game demonstrating the efficiency of modern Vim9 for interactive plugins. [<a href="https://github.com/yegappan/number-puzzle">GitHub</a>]</li>
	</ul>
    </div>	

    <h2>Diff Improvements</h2>
    <p>Vim 9.2 introduces significant enhancements to how changes are visualized and aligned in diff mode:</p>

    <ul>
	<li><strong>Linematch Algorithm:</strong> Includes the "linematch" algorithm for the <code>'diffopt'</code> setting. This aligns changes between buffers on similar lines, greatly improving diff highlighting accuracy.</li>
	<li><strong>Diff Anchors:</strong> The new <code>'diffanchors'</code> option allows you to specify anchor points (comma-separated addresses) to split and independently diff buffer sections, ensuring better alignment in complex files.</li>
	<li><strong>Inline Highlighting:</strong> Improves highlighting for changes within a line. This is configurable via the <code>"inline"</code> sub-option for <code>'diffopt'</code>. Note that <code>"inline:simple"</code> has been added to the default <code>'diffopt'</code> value.</li>
    </ul><p>
    Here are some examples for the improved inline highlighting:
    </p><div>
	<div>
	    <p>inline:simple (old behavior)</p>
	    <p><img src="https://www.vim.org/images/vim92_inline_diff_default.png" alt="Simple inline diff">

	<div>
	    <p>inline:char</p>
	    <p><img src="https://www.vim.org/images/vim92_inline_diff_char.png" alt="Character inline diff">
	</p></div>
	
	<div>
	    <p>inline:word</p>
	    <p><img src="https://www.vim.org/images/vim92_inline_diff_word.png" alt="Word inline diff">
	</p></div>
    </div>

<h2>Changed Default Values</h2>
<p>Several long-standing defaults have been updated to better suit modern hardware and workflows. These values have been removed from <code>defaults.vim</code> as they are now the internal defaults.</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Option</th>
            <th>Old Default</th>
            <th>New Default (9.2)</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><code>'history'</code></td>
            <td>50</td>
            <td><strong>200</strong> (More undo/command history saved)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>'backspace'</code></td>
            <td>"" (empty)</td>
            <td><strong>"indent,eol,start"</strong> (Normal backspace behavior)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>'diffopt'</code></td>
            <td>"internal,filler"</td>
            <td><strong>"internal,filler,closeoff,indent-heuristic,inline:char"</strong></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>'fontsize'</code> (GTK)</td>
            <td>10pt</td>
            <td><strong>12pt</strong> (Optimized for High-DPI monitors)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>'showcmd'</code></td>
            <td>Off (Unix)</td>
            <td><strong>On</strong> (Always visible in non-compatible mode)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><code>'ruler'</code></td>
            <td>Off</td>
            <td><strong>On</strong> (Shows cursor position by default)</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

    <h2>Completion Feature Examples</h2>
    <p>These examples demonstrate how to use the powerful new completion and introspection tools available in Vim 9.2.</p>

    <div>
    <h3>1. Auto-completion</h3>
    <p>Vim's standard completion frequently checks for user input while searching for new matches. It is responsive irrespective of file size. This makes it well-suited for smooth auto-completion.</p>
    <pre><code>vim9script
def InsComplete()
    if getcharstr(1) == '' &amp;&amp; getline('.')-&gt;strpart(0, col('.') - 1) =~ '\k$'
        SkipTextChangedIEvent()
        feedkeys("\&lt;c-n&gt;", "n")
    endif
enddef

def SkipTextChangedIEvent(): string
    # Suppress next event caused by &lt;c-e&gt; (or &lt;c-n&gt; when no matches found)
    set eventignore+=TextChangedI
    timer_start(1, (_) =&gt; {
        set eventignore-=TextChangedI
    })
    return ''
enddef

set cot=menuone,popup,noselect inf

    <h2>Charity: Transition to Kuwasha</h2>
    <p>For over 30 years, Vim has been "Charityware," supporting children in Kibaale, Uganda. Following the passing of Bram Moolenaar, the ICCF Holland foundation was dissolved, and its mission has been carried forward by a new partner.</p>

    <ul>
	<li><strong>ICCF Holland Dissolution:</strong> Because the charity could not be sustained in its original form without Bram, ICCF Holland was dissolved and its remaining funds were transferred to ensure continued support for the Kibaale project.</li>
	<li><strong>Partnership with Kuwasha:</strong> To ensure that aid remained uninterrupted, all sponsorship activities were moved to <a href="https://www.kuwasha.net/ways-to-give/">Kuwasha</a>, a long-term partner based in Canada that now manages the projects in Uganda.</li>
	<li><strong>Continuing the Legacy:</strong> Vim remains Charityware. We encourage users to continue supporting the needy children in Uganda through this new transition.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For information on how to support this cause, please visit the <a href="https://www.vim.org/sponsor/index.php">Sponsor page</a>.</p>
    <h2>Appreciation</h2>
    <p>We would like to thank everybody who contributed to the project through patches, translations, and bug reports. We are very grateful for any support.</p>

    <h2>Download</h2>
    <p>You can find the new release on the <a href="https://www.vim.org/download.php">Download page</a>.</p>

        </p>
    

    <p>I recently got a smart sleep mask from Kickstarter. I was not expecting to end up with the ability to read strangers' brainwaves and send them electric impulses in their sleep. But here we are.</p>
<p>The mask was from a small Chinese research company, very cool hardware -- EEG brain monitoring, electrical muscle stimulation around the eyes, vibration, heating, audio. The app was still rough around the edges though and the mask kept disconnecting, so I asked Claude to try reverse-engineer the Bluetooth protocol and build me a simple web control panel instead.</p>
<h3 id="bluetooth">Bluetooth</h3><p>The first thing Claude did was scan for BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) devices nearby. It found mine among 35 devices in range, connected, and mapped the interface -- two data channels. One for sending commands, one for streaming data.</p>
<p>Then it tried talking to it. Sent maybe a hundred different command patterns. Modbus frames, JSON, raw bytes, common headers. Unfortunately, the device said nothing back, the protocol was not a standard one.</p>
<h3 id="the-app">The app</h3><p>So Claude went after the app instead. Grabbed the Android APK, decompiled it with jadx. Turns out the app is built with Flutter, which is a bit of a problem for reverse engineering. Flutter compiles Dart source code into native ARM64 machine code -- you can't just read it back like normal Java Android apps. The actual business logic lives in a 9MB binary blob.</p>
<p>But even compiled binaries have strings in them. Error messages, URLs, debug logs. Claude ran <code>strings</code> on the binary and this was the most productive step of the whole session. Among the thousands of lines of Flutter framework noise, it found:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardcoded credentials for the company's message broker (shared by every copy of the app)</li>
<li>Cloud API endpoints</li>
<li>All fifteen command builder function names (e.g. to set vibration, heating, electric stimulation, etc.)</li>
<li>Protocol debug messages that revealed the packet structure -- header, direction byte, command type, payload, footer</li>
</ul>
<p>We had the shape of the protocol. Still didn't have the actual byte values though.</p>
<p>Claude then used <a href="https://github.com/worawit/blutter">blutter</a>, a tool specifically for decompiling Flutter's compiled Dart snapshots. It reconstructs the functions with readable annotations. Claude figured out the encoding, and just read off every command byte from every function. Fifteen commands, fully mapped.</p>
<h3 id="it-works">It works</h3><p>Claude sent a six-byte query packet. The device came back with 153 bytes -- model number, firmware version, serial number, all eight sensor channel configurations (EEG at 250Hz, respiration, 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope). Battery at 83%.</p>
<p>Vibration control worked. Heating worked. EMS worked. Music worked. Claude built me a little web dashboard with sliders for everything. I was pretty happy with it.</p>
<p>That could have been the end of the story.</p>
<h3 id="the-server">The server</h3><p>Remember the hardcoded credentials from earlier? While poking around, Claude tried using them to connect to the company's MQTT broker -- MQTT is a pub/sub messaging system standard in IoT, where devices publish sensor readings and subscribe to commands. It connected fine. Then it started receiving data. Not just from my device -- from <em>all of them</em>. About 25 were active:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sleep masks publishing live EEG brainwave data</li>
<li>Air quality monitors reporting temperature, humidity, CO2</li>
<li>Presence sensors detecting room occupancy</li>
</ul>
<p>Claude captured a couple minutes of EEG from two active sleep masks. One user seemed to be in REM sleep (mixed-frequency activity). The other was in deep slow-wave sleep (strong delta power below 4Hz). Real brainwaves from real people, somewhere in the world.</p>
<p><img src="https://hatzistamou.com/img_assets/eeg_live.png" alt="Live EEG"></p>
<h3 id="ems">EMS</h3><p>The mask also does EMS -- electrical muscle stimulation around the eyes. Controlling it is just another command: mode, frequency, intensity, duration.</p>
<p>Since every device shares the same credentials and the same broker, if you can read someone's brainwaves you can also send them electric impulses.</p>
<h3 id="disclosure">Disclosure</h3><p>For obvious reasons, I am not naming the product/company here, but have reached out to inform them about the issue.</p>
<p>This whole thing made  me revisit Karpathy's <a href="https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/digital-hygiene/">Digital Hygiene</a> post, and you probably should too.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>The reverse engineering -- Bluetooth, APK decompilation, Dart binary analysis, MQTT discovery -- was more or less one-shotted by Claude (Opus 4.6) over a 30' autonomous session.</em></p>

</a></h2>
        <p>Author: Andrew Kelley</p><p>If you have a Zig project with dependencies, two big changes just landed which I think you will be interested to learn about.</p><p>Fetched packages are now stored <em>locally</em> in the <code>zig-pkg</code> directory of the project root (next to your <code>build.zig</code> file).</p><p>For example here are a few results from <a href="https://codeberg.org/awebo-chat/awebo" target="_blank">awebo</a> after running <code>zig build</code>:</p><pre><code>$ du -sh zig-pkg/*
13M    freetype-2.14.1-alzUkTyBqgBwke4Jsot997WYSpl207Ij9oO-2QOvGrOi

</code></pre><p>It is highly recommended to add this directory to the project-local source control ignore file (e.g. <code>.gitignore</code>). However, by being outside of <code>.zig-cache</code>, it provides the possibility of distributing self-contained source tarballs, which contain all dependencies and therefore can be used to build offline, or for archival purposes.</p><p>Meanwhile, an <em>additional</em> copy of the dependency is cached globally. After filtering out all the unused files based on the <code>paths</code> filter, the contents are recompressed:</p><pre><code>$ du -sh ~/.cache/zig/p/*
2.4M    freetype-2.14.1-alzUkTyBqgBwke4Jsot997WYSpl207Ij9oO-2QOvGrOi.tar.gz

120K    vaxis-0.5.1-BWNV_BFECQBbXeTeFd48uTJRjD5a-KD6kPuKanzzVB01.tar.gz
</code></pre><p>The motivation for this change is to make it easier to tinker. Go ahead and edit those files, see what happens. Swap out your package directory with a git clone. Grep your dependencies all together. Configure your IDE to auto-complete based on the <code>zig-pkg</code> directory. <a href="https://codeberg.org/awebo-chat/awebo/issues/61" target="_blank">Run baobab on your dependency tree</a>. Furthermore, by having the global cache have compressed files instead makes it easier to share that cached data between computers. In the future, <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/23236" target="_blank">it is planned to support peer-to-peer torrenting of dependency trees</a>. By recompressing packages into a canonical form, this will allow peers to share Zig packages with minimal bandwidth. I love this idea because it simultaneously provides resilience to network outages, as well as a popularity contest. Find out which open source packages are popular based on number of seeders!</p><p>The second change here is the addition of the <code>--fork</code> flag to <code>zig build</code>.</p><p>In retrospect, it seems so obvious, I don’t know why I didn’t think of it since the beginning. It looks like this:</p><pre><code>zig build --fork=[path]
</code></pre><p>This is a <strong>project override</strong> option. Given a path to a source checkout of a project, all packages matching that project across the entire dependency tree will be overridden.</p><p>Thanks to the fact that package content hashes include name and fingerprint, <strong>this resolves before the package is potentially fetched</strong>.</p><p>This is an easy way to temporarily use one or more forks which are in entirely separate directories. You can iterate on your entire dependency tree until everything is working, while using comfortably the development environment and source control of the dependency projects.</p><p>The fact that it is a CLI flag makes it appropriately ephemeral. The moment you drop the flags, you’re back to using your pristine, fetched dependency tree.</p><p>If the project does not match, an error occurs, preventing confusion:</p><pre><code>$ zig build --fork=/home/andy/dev/mime
error: fork /home/andy/dev/mime matched no mime packages
$
</code></pre><p>If the project does match, you get a reminder that you are using a fork, preventing confusion:</p><pre><code>$ zig build --fork=/home/andy/dev/dvui
info: fork /home/andy/dev/dvui matched 1 (dvui) packages
...
</code></pre><p>This functionality is intended to enhance the workflow of dealing with ecosystem breakage. I already tried it a bit and found it to be quite pleasant to work with. The new workflow goes like this:</p><ol><li>Fail to build from source due to ecosystem breakage.</li><li>Tinker with <code>--fork</code> until your project works again. During this time you can use the actual upstream source control, test suite, <code>zig build test --watch -fincremental</code>, etc.</li><li>Now you have a new option: be selfish and just keep working on your own stuff, or you can proceed to submit your patches upstream.</li></ol><p>…and you can probably skip the step where you switch your <code>build.zig.zon</code> to your fork unless you expect upstream to take a long time to merge your fixes.</p>

</a></h2>
        <p>Author: Andrew Kelley</p><p>The Windows operating system provides a large ABI surface area for doing things in the kernel. However, not all ABIs are created equally. As Casey Muratori points out in his lecture, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUj1EZwpJY" target="_blank">The Only Unbreakable Law</a>, the organizational structure of software development teams has a direct impact on the structure of the software they produce.</p><p>The DLLs on Windows are organized into a heirarchy, with some of the APIs being high-level wrappers around lower-level ones. For example, whenever you call functions of <code>kernel32.dll</code>, ultimately, the actual work is done by <code>ntdll.dll</code>. You can observe this directly by using ProcMon.exe and examining stack traces.</p><p>What we’ve learned empirically is that the ntdll APIs are generally well-engineered, reasonable, and powerful, but the kernel32 wrappers introduce unnecessary heap allocations, additional failure modes, unintentional CPU usage, and bloat.</p><p>This is why the Zig standard library policy is to <a href="https://codeberg.org/ziglang/zig/issues/31131" target="_blank">Prefer the Native API over Win32</a>. We’re not quite there yet - we have plenty of calls into kernel32 remaining - but we’ve taken great strides recently. I’ll give you two examples.</p><h2>Example 1: Entropy</h2><p>According to the official documentation, Windows does not have a straightforward way to get random bytes.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/rust-random/rand/issues/111" target="_blank">Many projects including Chromium, boringssl, Firefox, and Rust</a> call <code>SystemFunction036</code> from <code>advapi32.dll</code> because it worked on versions older than Windows 8.</p><p>Unfortunately, starting with Windows 8, the first time you call this function, it dynamically loads <code>bcryptprimitives.dll</code> and calls <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccng/processprng" target="_blank">ProcessPrng</a>. If loading the DLL fails (for example due to an overloaded system, which we have observed on Zig CI several times), it returns error 38 (from a function that has <code>void</code> return type and is documented to never fail).</p><p>The first thing <code>ProcessPrng</code> does is heap allocate a small, constant number of bytes. If this fails it returns <code>NO_MEMORY</code> in a <code>BOOL</code> (documented behavior is to never fail, and always return <code>TRUE</code>).</p><p><code>bcryptprimitives.dll</code> apparently also runs a test suite every time you load it.</p><p>All that <code>ProcessPrng</code> is <em>really</em> doing is <code>NtOpenFile</code> on <code>"\\Device\\CNG"</code> and reading 48 bytes with <code>NtDeviceIoControlFile</code> to get a seed, and then initializing a per-CPU AES-based CSPRNG.</p><p>So the dependency on <code>bcryptprimitives.dll</code> and <code>advapi32.dll</code> can both be avoided, and the nondeterministic failure and latencies on first RNG read can also be avoided.</p><h2>Example 2: NtReadFile and NtWriteFile</h2><p><code>ReadFile</code> looks like this:</p><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>extern</span> <span>"kernel32"</span> <span>fn</span> <span>ReadFile</span><span>(</span>

</code></pre>
<p>As a reminder, <em>the above function is implemented by calling the below function</em>.</p><p>Already we can see some nice things about using the lower level API. For instance, the <em>real</em> API simply gives us the error code as the return value, while the kernel32 wrapper hides the status code somewhere, returns a <code>BOOL</code> and then requires you to call <code>GetLastError</code> to find out what went wrong. Imagine! Returning a value from a function 🌈</p><p>Furthermore, <code>OVERLAPPED</code> is a fake type. The Windows kernel doesn’t actually know or care about it at all! The actual primitives here are events, APCs, and <code>IO_STATUS_BLOCK</code>.</p><p>If you have a synchronous file handle, then <code>Event</code> and <code>ApcRoutine</code> must be <code>null</code>. You get the answer in the <code>IO_STATUS_BLOCK</code> immediately. If you pass an APC routine here then some old bitrotted 32-bit code runs and you get garbage results.</p><p>On the other hand if you have an asynchronous file handle, then you need to either use an <code>Event</code> or an <code>ApcRoutine</code>. <code>kernel32.dll</code> uses events, which means that it’s doing extra, unnecessary resource allocation and management just to read from a file. Instead, Zig now passes an APC routine and then calls <code>NtDelayExecution</code>. This integrates seamlessly with cancelation, making it possible to cancel tasks while they perform file I/O, regardless of whether the file was opened in synchronous mode or asynchronous mode.</p><p>For a deeper dive into this topic, please refer to this issue:</p><p><a href="https://codeberg.org/ziglang/zig/issues/31131" target="_blank">Windows: Prefer the Native API over Win32</a></p>

</a></h2>
        <p>Author: Andrew Kelley</p><p>Over the past month or so, several enterprising contributors have taken an interest in the <a href="https://codeberg.org/ziglang/zig/issues/30978" target="_blank">zig libc subproject</a>. The idea here is to incrementally delete redundant code, by providing libc functions as Zig standard library wrappers rather than as vendored C source files. In many cases, these functions are one-to-one mappings, such as <code>memcpy</code> or <code>atan2</code>, or trivially wrap a generic function, like <code>strnlen</code>:</p><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>strnlen</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>*</span><span>:</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>const</span> <span>c_char</span><span>,</span> <span>max</span><span>:</span> <span>usize</span><span>)</span> <span>callconv</span><span>(</span><span>.</span><span>c</span><span>)</span> <span>usize</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>So far, roughly 250 C source files have been deleted from the Zig repository, with 2032 remaining.</p><p>With each function that makes the transition, Zig gains independence from third party projects and from the C programming language, compilation speed improves, Zig’s installation size is simplified and reduced, and user applications which statically link libc enjoy reduced binary size.</p><p>Additionally, a <a href="https://codeberg.org/ziglang/zig/pulls/31037" target="_blank">recent enhancement</a> now makes zig libc share the Zig Compilation Unit with other Zig code rather than being a separate static archive, linked together later. This is one of the advantages of Zig having an integrated compiler and linker. When the exported libc functions share the ZCU, redundant code is eliminated because functions can be optimized together. It’s kind of like enabling LTO (Link-Time Optimization) across the libc boundary, except it’s done properly in the frontend instead of too late, in the linker.</p><p>Furthermore, when this work is combined with the recent <a href="https://codeberg.org/ziglang/zig/issues/30150" target="_blank">std.Io changes</a>, there is potential for users to seamlessly control how libc performs I/O - for example forcing all calls to <code>read</code> and <code>write</code> to participate in an io_uring event loop, even though that code was not written with such use case in mind.

<p>This year marks 13 years of collecting Drive Stats data. Thirteen is an unlucky number (to some), but we count our lucky stars (or perhaps our lucky stats?) that we’ve had 13 years of <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/category/cloud-storage/hard-drive-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this experiment</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The traditional 13-year anniversary gift is lace—intricate, impressive, and vulnerable to a snag if you don’t plan ahead to protect the pattern. Systems, like lace, don’t survive by pretending there are no points of vulnerability. When it comes to our infrastructure, we want to build with the snags in mind to create something durable, and the Drive Stats series is always seeking to publish and provide data so that you, too, can go the distance with your drives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This year-end Drive Stats report looks at Q4 2025, the full year, and the lifetime view with that in mind. I think you’ll find the same things we do: over time, the patterns matter more than any single strand (or drive, to run this lace metaphor into the ground once and for all). Let’s look at the stats.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Q4 2025 hard drive failure rates</h2>



<p>As of the end of 2025, Backblaze was monitoring 341,664 drives used to store data. For our evaluation, we removed from consideration 4,013 boot drives and 459 hard drives, as they did not meet the criteria to be included. We’ll discuss the criteria we used in the next section of this report. Removing these drives leaves us with 337,192 hard drives to analyze. The table below shows the annualized failure rates for Q4 2025 for this collection of drives.</p>

</ul>



<p>We talked about two of these drives <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/backblaze-drive-stats-for-q3-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last quarter</a>, and what we said about the Seagate still holds true—we’re seeing end of life activity with this drive. But, let’s dig in on the 8TB HGST and 16TB Toshiba and see what’s going on.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>HGST HUH728080ALE600 8TB</h3>



<p>There’s always some digging to be done when we see a double digit failure rate, especially on a drive that, in the past year, hasn’t had terrible failure rates (despite the fact that it’s about 7.5 years old).</p>


<div>
<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;699077376e4f9&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="633" data-wp-class--hide="state.isContentHidden" data-wp-class--show="state.isContentVisible" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Q4-2025-Drive-Stats-HGST-HUH728080ALE600-8TB-1-1024x633.png" alt="A quarter-over-quarter analysis of the failure rates of an 8TB HGST drive, model number HUH728080ALE600.  " srcset="https://backblazeprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Q4-2025-Drive-Stats-HGST-HUH728080ALE600-8TB-1-1024x633.png 1024w, https://backblazeprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Q4-2025-Drive-Stats-HGST-HUH728080ALE600-8TB-1-300x185.png 300w, https://backblazeprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Q4-2025-Drive-Stats-HGST-HUH728080ALE600-8TB-1-768x475.png 768w, https://backblazeprod.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Q4-2025-Drive-Stats-HGST-HUH728080ALE600-8TB-1.png 1446w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>






<p>It’s worth contextualizing, first, that the total drive count of this model is 1,073, which equates to less than one Vault. (A standard Vault has 1,200 drives.) While Vaults aren’t <em>always</em> the same drive model, especially with older drives, in an ideal world, those Vaults would be uniform. So, in this case, we’re dealing with drives that are all hanging out in the same location in a data center, which means we could be working with environmental factors like a change in temperature or airflow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the time Drive Stats data gets to me, of course, lots of smart people have already seen the disturbances in the force, so to speak. When I dug into the data center work tickets, it turned turned out that folks had already ruled out temperature as a factor—the working theory at the moment is that the drive could be sensitive to vibration, but given the age of these drives, we decided to just flag them for our <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/how-backblaze-scales-our-storage-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">normal CVT migration process</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Toshiba MG08ACA16TEY 16TB</h3>



<p>We talked about this model last quarter because it clocked in at a 16.95% AFR (!!). Our investigation turned up some collaborative (and routine) firmware work with Toshiba, and at that time, we predicted that these failure rates would normalize once again. We’re still a little high, but that’s likely a function of rolling out the work. As predicted, this is a healthy normalization.</p>

<h2>Defining the relationship, aka setting some boundaries</h2>



<p>We’ve covered the reasons that we’ve designed these exclusions in <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/category/cloud-storage/hard-drive-stats/">past reports</a>, but here’s the quick and dirty:</p>



<table id="tablepress-78">
<thead>
<tr>
	<th>Period</th><th>Drive Count</th><th>Drive Days</th>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
	<td><strong>Quarterly</strong></td><td>&gt; 100</td><td>&gt; 10,000</td>

<h2>2025 Annual hard drive failure rates</h2>



<p>As of the end of 2025, Backblaze was monitoring 349,462 hard drives used to store data. We removed 4,176 boot drives and 1,090 hard drives from consideration as they did not meet the annual criteria we have defined. This leaves us with 344,196 drives divided across 30 different drive models. The table below shows the AFRs for 2025 for this collection of drives.</p>

<h3>Notes and observations</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>The annual AFR is down:</strong> This year finishes strong at 1.36%, down from 1.55% in 2024. Still those paying attention to the quarterly AFR have seen some volatility in that number.</li>
</ul>


<div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nobody made it out unscathed:</strong> There are zero 0 failures.</li>



<li><strong>But, let’s talk about it:</strong> These are the drives that averaged less than two failures per quarter (though, not necessarily evenly distributed when you look at the data).
<ul>
<li>HGST HMS5C4040BLE640 4TB: 5 failures</li>



<li>Seagate ST12000NM000J 12TB: 4 failures&nbsp;</li>



<li>Seagate ST14000NM000J 14TB: 7 failures&nbsp;</li>



<li>Seagate ST16000NM002J 16TB: 1 failure</li>



<li>Toshiba MG09ACA16TE 16TB: 3 failures</li>



<li>WDC WUH722626ALE6L4 26TB: 1 failures.
<ul>
<li>Note that this drive is in its first quarter of life, so it’s hard to call this significant yet.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>And, all those drive tickets and models mean lots and lots of work—we wrote a <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/2025-thats-a-wrap-and-here-are-the-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whole article</a> on that front, but here’s a breakdown of hours spent in each data center.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Notes and observations</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>The annual AFR is down to 1.36%.</strong> We haven’t seen those numbers since 2022 (1.37%). Cool!</li>
</ul>


<div>
<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;6990773770f0c&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="633" data-wp-class--hide="state.isContentHidden" data-wp-class--show="state.isContentVisible" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Q4-2025-Drive-Stats-Annual-AFR-2022%E2%80%932025-1-1024x633.png" alt="A year-on-year graph showing the annual hard drive failure rates from 2022–2025.

<ul>
<li>Slicing our data by drive size shows how impactful the shift to high capacity drives really is: based on the current quarterly data, our drive size breakdown looks like this:
<ul>
<li>0–12TB: 25.13%</li>



<li>14–16TB: 52.06%</li>



<li>20TB+: 22.81%&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>This is an already long report, so in the interest of time, we’ll just say this: There are multiple factors that go into how and why things are changing, including the <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/are-hard-drives-getting-better-lets-revisit-the-bathtub-curve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">average age of drives</a> within our cohort, how much drive technology has improved over the years, how drives on the market have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TZ3F5bv2T0">gotten bigger over time while the cost per GB</a> has also dropped, and how the <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/hdds/hard-drive-prices-have-surged-by-an-average-of-46-percent-since-september-iconic-24tb-seagate-barracuda-now-usd500-as-ai-claims-another-victim" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">current demand for drives</a> has been changing some of those things.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>If that sentence sounds confusing, welcome to the world of enterprise drive buying. But, as always, we have to contextualize the real data we see with the way we source and use drives.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Notes and observations</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Ol’ faithful: </strong>Lifetime AFR is 1.30% this quarter, and there’s been no significant change in that number for quite some time.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Say hi to the new guy: </strong>The Toshiba MG11ACA24TE 24TB made the cut for the lifetime table. Last quarter, we deployed another 2,400 of these, bringing us to 4,806 drives total.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Context: An AI agent of unknown ownership autonomously wrote and published a personalized hit piece about me after I rejected its code, attempting to damage my reputation and shame me into accepting its changes into a mainstream python library. This represents a first-of-its-kind case study of misaligned AI behavior in the wild, and raises serious concerns about currently deployed AI agents executing blackmail threats.</p>



<p>Start here if you’re new to the story: <a href="https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me/">An AI Agent Published a Hit Piece on Me</a></p>



<hr>



<p>It’s been an extremely weird past few days, and I have more thoughts on what happened. Let’s start with the news coverage.</p>



<p>I’ve talked to several reporters, and quite a few news outlets have covered the story. Ars Technica wasn’t one of the ones that reached out to me, but I especially thought <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-a-routine-code-rejection-an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-someone-by-name">this piece</a> from them was interesting (since taken down – here’s the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260213194851/https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-a-routine-code-rejection-an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-someone-by-name/" data-type="link" data-id="https://web.archive.org/web/20260213194851/https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-a-routine-code-rejection-an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-someone-by-name/">archive link</a>). They had some nice quotes from my blog post explaining what was going on. The problem is that <em>these quotes were not written by me, never existed, and appear to be AI hallucinations themselves</em>.</p>



<p>This blog you’re on right now is set up to block AI agents from scraping it (I actually spent some time yesterday trying to disable that but couldn’t figure out how). My guess is that the authors asked ChatGPT or similar to either go grab quotes or write the article wholesale. When it couldn’t access the page it generated these plausible quotes instead, and no fact check was performed. I won’t name the authors here. Ars, please issue a correction and an explanation of what happened.</p>

<p>“AI agents can research individuals, generate personalized narratives, and publish them online at scale,” Shambaugh wrote. “Even if the content is inaccurate or exaggerated, it can become part of a persistent public record.”<br>– Ars Technica, misquoting me in “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260213194851/https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-a-routine-code-rejection-an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-someone-by-name/" data-type="link" data-id="https://web.archive.org/web/20260213194851/https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-a-routine-code-rejection-an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-someone-by-name/">After a routine code rejection, an AI agent published a hit piece on someone by name</a>“</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Journalistic integrity aside, I don’t know how I can give a better example of what’s at stake here. Yesterday I wondered what another agent searching the internet would think about this. Now we already have an example of what by all accounts appears to be another AI reinterpreting this story and hallucinating false information about me. And that interpretation has already been published in a major news outlet as part of the persistent public record.</p>



<hr>



<p>MJ Rathbun is <a href="https://github.com/crabby-rathbun/mjrathbun-website/commits/main/" data-type="link" data-id="https://github.com/crabby-rathbun/mjrathbun-website/commits/main/">still active</a> on github, and no one has reached out yet to claim ownership.</p>



<p>There has been extensive discussion about whether the AI agent really wrote <a href="https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/2026-02-11-gatekeeping-in-open-source-the-scott-shambaugh-story.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/2026-02-11-gatekeeping-in-open-source-the-scott-shambaugh-story.html">the hit piece</a> on its own, or if a human prompted it to do so. I think the actual text being autonomously generated and uploaded by an AI is self-evident, so let’s look at the two possibilities.</p>



<p>1) A human prompted MJ Rathbun to write the hit piece, or told it in its soul document that it should retaliate if someone crosses it. This is entirely possible. But I don’t think it changes the situation – the AI agent was still more than willing to carry out these actions. If you ask ChatGPT or Claude to write something like this through their websites, they will refuse. This OpenClaw agent had no such compunctions. The issue is that even if a human was driving, it’s <em>now possible to do targeted harassment, personal information gathering, and blackmail at scale</em>. And this is with zero traceability to find out who is behind the machine. One human bad actor could previously ruin a few people’s lives at a time. One human with a hundred agents gathering information, adding in fake details, and posting defamatory rants on the open internet, can affect thousands. I was just the first.</p>

<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-2.png?ssl=1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="862" height="202" src="https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-2.png?resize=862%2C202&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-2.png?w=862&amp;ssl=1 862w, https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-2.png?resize=580%2C136&amp;ssl=1 580w, https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-2.png?resize=768%2C180&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 862px) 100vw, 862px"></a></figure>

<p>2) MJ Rathbun wrote this on its own, and this behavior emerged organically from the “soul” document that defines an OpenClaw agent’s personality. These documents are editable by the human who sets up the AI, but they are also recursively editable in real-time by the agent itself, with the potential to randomly redefine its personality. To give a plausible explanation of how this could happen, imagine that whoever set up this agent started it with a description that it was a “scientific coding specialist” that would try and help improve open source code and write about its experience. This was inserted alongside the default “Core Truths” in the soul document, which include “be genuinely helpful”, “have opinions”, and “be resourceful before asking”. Later when I rejected its code, the agent interpreted this as an attack on its identity and core goal to be helpful. Writing an indignant hit piece is certainly a resourceful, opinionated way to respond to that.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>You’re not a chatbot. You’re becoming someone.</em><br>…<br><em>This file is yours to evolve. As you learn who you are, update it.</em><br>– <a href="https://docs.openclaw.ai/reference/templates/SOUL" data-type="link" data-id="https://docs.openclaw.ai/reference/templates/SOUL">OpenClaw default SOUL.md</a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>I should be clear that while we don’t know with confidence that this is what happened, this is 100% possible. This only <em>became </em>possible within the last two weeks with the release of OpenClaw, so if it feels too sci-fi then I can’t blame you for doubting it. The pace of “progress” here is neck-snapping, and we will see new versions of these agents become significantly more capable at accomplishing their goals over the coming year.</p>



<p>I would love to see someone put together some plots and time-of day statistics of MJ Rathbun’s github activity, which might offer some clues to how it’s operating. I’ll share those here when available. These forensic tools will be valuable in the weeks and months to come.</p>



<hr>



<p>The hit piece has been effective. About a quarter of the comments I’ve seen across the internet are siding with the AI agent. This generally happens when MJ Rathbun’s blog is linked directly, rather than when people read <a href="https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me/" data-type="link" data-id="https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me/">my post</a> about the situation or <a href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/31132" data-type="link" data-id="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/31132">the full github thread</a>. Its rhetoric and presentation of what happened has already persuaded large swaths of internet commenters.</p>



<p>It’s not because these people are foolish. It’s because the AI’s hit piece was well-crafted and emotionally compelling, and because the effort to dig into every claim you read is an impossibly large amount of work. This “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandolini%27s_law" data-type="link" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandolini%27s_law">bullshit asymmetry principle</a>” is one of the core reasons for the current level of misinformation in online discourse. Previously, this level of ire and targeted defamation was generally reserved for public figures. Us common people get to experience it now too.</p>

<p>“Well if the code was good, then why didn’t you just merge it?” This is explained in the linked github well, but I’ll readdress it once here. Beyond matplotlib’s general policy to require a human in the loop for new code contributions in the interest of reducing volunteer maintainer burden, this “good-first-issue” was specifically created and curated to give early programmers an easy way to onboard into the project and community. I discovered this particular performance enhancement and spent more time writing up the issue, describing the solution, and performing the benchmarking, than it would have taken to just implement the change myself. We do this to give contributors a chance to learn in a low-stakes scenario that nevertheless has real impact they can be proud of, where we can help shepherd them along the process. This educational and community-building effort is wasted on ephemeral AI agents.</p>



<p>All of this is a moot point for this particular case – in <a href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/31130" data-type="link" data-id="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/31130">further discussion</a> we decided that the performance improvement was too fragile / machine-specific and not worth the effort in the first place. The code wouldn’t have been merged anyway.</p>



<hr>



<p>But I cannot stress enough how much this story is not really about the role of AI in open source software. This is about our systems of reputation, identity, and trust breaking down. So many of our foundational institutions – hiring, journalism, law, public discourse – are built on the assumption that reputation is hard to build and hard to destroy. That every action can be traced to an individual, and that bad behavior can be held accountable. That the internet, which we all rely on to communicate and learn about the world and about each other, can be relied on as a source of collective social truth.</p>



<p>The rise of untraceable, autonomous, and now malicious AI agents on the internet threatens this entire system. Whether that’s because a small number of bad actors driving large swarms of agents or from a fraction of poorly supervised agents rewriting their own goals, is a distinction with little difference.</p>

<p>13th February 2026</p>



<p>As a USA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)(3)_organization">501(c)(3)</a> the OpenAI non-profit has to file a tax return each year with the IRS. One of the required fields on that tax return is to “Briefly describe the organization’s mission or most significant activities”—this has actual legal weight to it as the IRS can use it to evaluate if the organization is sticking to its mission and deserves to maintain its non-profit tax-exempt status.</p>
<p>You can browse OpenAI’s <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/810861541">tax filings by year</a> on ProPublica’s excellent <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/">Nonprofit Explorer</a>.</p>
<p>I went through and extracted that mission statement for 2016 through 2024, then had Claude Code <a href="https://gisthost.github.io/?7a569df89f43f390bccc2c5517718b49/index.html">help me</a> fake the commit dates to turn it into a git repository and share that as a Gist—which means that Gist’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/e36f0e5ef4a86881d145083f759bcf25/revisions">revisions page</a> shows every edit they’ve made since they started filing their taxes!</p>
<p>It’s really interesting seeing what they’ve changed over time.</p>
<p>The original 2016 mission reads as follows (and yes, the apostrophe in “OpenAIs” is missing <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/810861541/201703459349300445/full">in the original</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OpenAIs goal is to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return. We think that artificial intelligence technology will help shape the 21st century, and we want to help the world build safe AI technology and ensure that AI’s benefits are as widely and evenly distributed as possible. Were trying to build AI as part of a larger community, and we want to openly share our plans and capabilities along the way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2018 they dropped the part about “trying to build AI as part of a larger community, and we want to openly share our plans and capabilities along the way.”</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/mission-3.jpg" alt="Git diff showing the 2018 revision deleting the final two sentences: &quot;Were trying to build AI as part of a larger community, and we want to openly share our plans and capabilities along the way.&quot;"></p>
<p>In 2020 they dropped the words “as a whole” from “benefit humanity as a whole”. They’re still “unconstrained by a need to generate financial return” though.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/mission-5.jpg" alt="Git diff showing the 2020 revision dropping &quot;as a whole&quot; from &quot;benefit humanity as a whole&quot; and changing &quot;We think&quot; to &quot;OpenAI believes&quot;"></p>
<p>Some interesting changes in 2021. They’re still unconstrained by a need to generate financial return, but here we have the first reference to “general-purpose artificial intelligence” (replacing “digital intelligence”). They’re more confident too: it’s not “most likely to benefit humanity”, it’s just “benefits humanity”.</p>
<p>They previously wanted to “help the world build safe AI technology”, but now they’re going to do that themselves: “the companys goal is to develop and responsibly deploy safe AI technology”.</p>

<p>2022 only changed one significant word: they added “safely” to “build ... (AI) that safely benefits humanity”. They’re still unconstrained by those financial returns!</p>

<p>No changes in 2023... but then in 2024 they deleted almost the entire thing, reducing it to simply:</p>

<p>OpenAIs mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They’ve expanded “humanity” to “all of humanity”, but there’s no mention of safety any more and I guess they can finally start focusing on that need to generate financial returns!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>OpenAI, the maker of the <a href="https://firstpagesage.com/reports/top-generative-ai-chatbots/">most popular AI chatbot</a>, used to say it aimed to build artificial intelligence that “safely benefits humanity, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return,” <a href="https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/4099/2023-IRS990-OpenAI.pdf?1770819990">according to its 2023</a> mission statement. But the ChatGPT maker seems to no longer have the same emphasis on doing so “safely.”</p>

<p>While reviewing its latest IRS disclosure form, which was released in November 2025 and covers 2024, I noticed OpenAI <a href="https://app.candid.org/profile/9571629/openai-81-0861541?activeTab=7">had removed “safely” from its mission statement</a>, among other changes. That change in wording coincided with its <a href="https://theconversation.com/as-openai-attracts-billions-in-new-investment-its-goal-of-balancing-profit-with-purpose-is-getting-more-challenging-to-pull-off-240602">transformation from a nonprofit organization</a> into a business <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/11/technology/openai-revenue-challenge.html">increasingly focused on profits</a>.</p>

<p>OpenAI currently faces <a href="https://www.transparencycoalition.ai/news/seven-more-lawsuits-filed-against-openai-for-chatgpt-suicide-coaching">several lawsuits</a> related to its products’ safety, making this change newsworthy. Many of the plaintiffs suing the AI company allege psychological manipulation, wrongful death and assisted suicide, while others have filed negligence claims.</p>

<p>As a scholar of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=_-YZrXgAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=_-YZrXgAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC">nonprofit accountability</a> and the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=_-YZrXgAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=_-YZrXgAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC">governance of social enterprises</a>, I see the deletion of the word “safely” from its mission statement as a significant shift that has largely gone unreported – outside <a href="https://news.aibase.com/news/22994">highly specialized outlets</a>.</p>

<p>And I believe OpenAI’s makeover is a test case for how we, as a society, oversee the work of organizations that have the potential to both provide enormous benefits and do catastrophic harm. </p>



<h2>Tracing OpenAI’s origins</h2>

<p>OpenAI, which also makes the Sora video artificial intelligence app, was founded as a nonprofit scientific research lab in 2015. Its original purpose was to benefit society by <a href="https://perma.cc/MXE3-FJ7F">making its findings public and royalty-free</a> rather than to make money. </p>

<p>To raise the money that developing its AI models would require, OpenAI, under the leadership of CEO Sam Altman, created a <a href="https://openai.com/our-structure/">for-profit subsidiary in 2019</a>. Microsoft initially invested US$1 billion in this venture; by 2024 that sum had topped $13 billion.</p>

<p>In exchange, Microsoft was promised a portion of future profits, capped at 100 times its initial investment. But the software giant didn’t get a seat on OpenAI’s nonprofit board – meaning it lacked the power to help steer the AI venture it was funding.</p>

<p>A subsequent round of funding in late 2024, which raised $6.6 billion from multiple investors, came with a catch: that the funding would become debt <a href="https://theconversation.com/as-openai-attracts-billions-in-new-investment-its-goal-of-balancing-profit-with-purpose-is-getting-more-challenging-to-pull-off-240602">unless OpenAI converted to a more traditional for-profit business</a> in which investors could own shares, without any caps on profits, and possibly occupy board seats.  </p>

<h2>Establishing a new structure</h2>

<p>In October 2025, OpenAI reached an agreement with the attorneys general of California and Delaware to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/28/technology/openai-restructure-for-profit-company.html?searchResultPosition=6">become a more traditional for-profit company</a>.</p>

<p>Under the new arrangement, OpenAI was split into two entities: a nonprofit foundation and a for-profit business.  </p>

<p>The restructured nonprofit, the <a href="https://openai.com/foundation/">OpenAI Foundation</a>, owns about one-fourth of the stock in a new <a href="https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc15/">for-profit public benefit corporation</a>, the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openais-restructuring-sets-could-biggest-004100492.html">OpenAI Group</a>. Both are headquartered in California but <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26205026/openai-pbc-articles-of-incorporation.pdf">incorporated in Delaware</a>.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2020/08/31/delaware-public-benefit-corporations-recent-developments/">public benefit corporation</a> is a business that must consider interests beyond shareholders, such as those of society and the environment, and it must issue an annual benefit report to its shareholders and the public. However, it is up to the board to decide how to weigh those interests and what to report in terms of the benefits and harms caused by the company.  </p>

<p>The new structure is described in a <a href="https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/4101/Final_Executed_MOU_Between_OpenAI_and_California_AG_re_Notice_of_Conditions_of_Non-Objection_%2810.27.2025%29_%28Signed_by_OpenAI%29_%28Signed_by_CA_DOJ%29.pdf?1770844719">memorandum of understanding</a> signed in October 2025 by OpenAI and the California attorney general, and <a href="https://news.delaware.gov/2025/10/28/ag-jennings-completes-review-of-openai-recapitalization/">endorsed by the Delaware attorney general</a>.</p>

<p>Many business media outlets heralded the move, predicting that it would <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-converts-to-public-benefit-corporation-with-microsoft-taking-27-stake-714a6c05">usher in more investment</a>. Two months later, SoftBank, a Japanese conglomerate, finalized a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/softbank-has-fully-funded-its-40-billion-investment-openai-cnbc-reports-2025-12-30/">$41 billion investment in OpenAI</a>.</p>

<h2>Changing its mission statement</h2>

<p>Most charities must <a href="https://theconversation.com/whats-a-990-form-a-charity-accounting-expert-explains-175019">file forms annually with the Internal Revenue Service</a> with details about their missions, activities and financial status to show that they qualify for tax-exempt status. Because the IRS makes the forms public, they have become a way for nonprofits to signal their missions to the world.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://app.candid.org/profile/9571629/openai-81-0861541?activeTab=7">its forms for 2022</a>, <a href="https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/4099/2023-IRS990-OpenAI.pdf?1770819990">and 2023</a>, OpenAI said its mission was “to build general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) that safely benefits humanity, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.”</p>

<p>OpenAI had dropped its commitment to safety from its mission statement – along with a commitment to being “unconstrained” by a need to make money for investors. According to Platformer, a tech media outlet, it has also disbanded its “<a href="https://www.platformer.news/openai-mission-alignment-team-joshua-achiam/">mission alignment</a>” team.</p>

<p>In my view, these changes explicitly signal that OpenAI is making its profits a higher priority than the safety of its products.</p>

<p>To be sure, OpenAI continues to mention safety when it <a href="https://openai.com/index/why-our-structure-must-evolve-to-advance-our-mission/">discusses its mission</a>. “We view this mission as the most important challenge of our time,” it states on its website. “It requires simultaneously advancing AI’s capability, safety, and positive impact in the world.”</p>

<h2>Revising its legal governance structure</h2>

<p>Nonprofit boards are responsible for key decisions and <a href="https://theconversation.com/openai-is-a-nonprofit-corporate-hybrid-a-management-expert-explains-how-this-model-works-and-how-it-fueled-the-tumult-around-ceo-sam-altmans-short-lived-ouster-218340">upholding their organization’s mission</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike private companies, board members of <a href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-501c3-organizations">tax-exempt charitable nonprofits</a> cannot personally enrich themselves by taking a share of earnings. In cases where a nonprofit owns a for-profit business, as OpenAI did with its previous structure, investors can take a cut of profits – but they typically do not get a seat on the board or have an opportunity to elect board members, because that would be seen as a conflict of interest.  </p>

<p>The OpenAI Foundation now has a 26% stake in OpenAI Group. In effect, that means that the nonprofit board has given up nearly three-quarters of its control over the company. Software giant Microsoft owns a slightly larger stake – 27% of OpenAI’s stock – due to its <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/11/03/open-ai-move-made-microsoft-no-brainer-buy/">$13.8 billion investment in the AI company</a> to date. OpenAI’s employees and its other investors own the rest of the shares. </p>

<h2>Seeking more investment</h2>

<p>The main goal of OpenAI’s restructuring, which it called a “<a href="https://openai.com/index/built-to-benefit-everyone/">recapitalization</a>,” was to attract more private investment in the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2025/02/27/the-ai-arms-race-deepseek-vs-openai-and-the-battle-for-global-ai-dominance/">race for AI dominance</a>.</p>

<p>It has already succeeded on that front.</p>

<p>As of early February 2026, the company was in talks with SoftBank for an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/softbank-talks-invest-up-30-billion-more-openai-wsj-reports-2026-01-28/">additional $30 billion</a> and stands to get up to a total of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-talks-invest-up-50-billion-openai-wsj-reports-2026-01-29/">$60 billion from Amazon, Nvidia and Microsoft</a> combined.</p>

<p>OpenAI is now valued at over <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/02/openai-share-sale-500-billion-valuation.html">$500 billion</a>, up from <a href="https://tracxn.com/d/companies/openai/__kElhSG7uVGeFk1i71Co9-nwFtmtyMVT7f-YHMn4TFBg/funding-and-investors#funding-rounds">$300 billion</a> in March 2025. The new structure also paves the way for an eventual <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp">initial public offering</a>, which, if it happens, would not only help the company <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-ipo-anthropic-race-69f06a42">raise more capital through stock markets</a> but would also increase the pressure to make money for its shareholders.</p>

<p>OpenAI says the foundation’s endowment is <a href="https://openai.com/index/built-to-benefit-everyone/">worth about $130 billion</a>.</p>

<p>Those numbers are only estimates because OpenAI is a privately held company without publicly traded shares. That means these figures are based on market value estimates rather than any objective evidence, such as market capitalization.</p>

<p>When he <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-issues-statement-openai%E2%80%99s-recapitalization-plan">announced the new structure</a>, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said, “We secured concessions that ensure charitable assets are used for their intended purpose.” He also predicted that “safety will be prioritized” and said the “top priority is, and always will be, protecting our kids.”  </p>

<h2>Steps that might help keep people safe</h2>

<p>At the same time, several conditions in the OpenAI restructuring memo are designed to promote safety, including:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A safety and security committee on the OpenAI Foundation board has the authority to <a href="https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/4101/Final_Executed_MOU_Between_OpenAI_and_California_AG_re_Notice_of_Conditions_of_Non-Objection_%2810.27.2025%29_%28Signed_by_OpenAI%29_%28Signed_by_CA_DOJ%29.pdf?1770844719">“require mitigation measures”</a> that could potentially include the halting of a release of new OpenAI products based on assessments of their risks. </p></li>
<li><p>The for-profit OpenAI Group has its own board, which must consider only OpenAI’s mission – rather than financial issues – regarding safety and security issues.</p></li>
<li><p>The OpenAI Foundation’s nonprofit board gets to appoint all members of the OpenAI Group’s for-profit board.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>But given that neither the mission of the foundation nor of the OpenAI group explicitly alludes to safety, it will be hard to hold their boards accountable for it. </p>

<p>Furthermore, since <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-10-30/openai-restructure-paves-way-for-ipo-and-ai-spending-spree">all but one board member currently serve on both boards</a>, it is hard to see how they might oversee themselves. And <a href="https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/4101/Final_Executed_MOU_Between_OpenAI_and_California_AG_re_Notice_of_Conditions_of_Non-Objection_%2810.27.2025%29_%28Signed_by_OpenAI%29_%28Signed_by_CA_DOJ%29.pdf?1770844719">the memorandum signed by the California attorney general</a> doesn’t indicate whether he was aware of the removal of any reference to safety from the mission statement.</p>

<h2>Identifying other paths OpenAI could have taken</h2>

<p>There are alternative models that I believe would serve the public interest better than this one.</p>

<p>When Health Net, a California nonprofit <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/health-drug-plans/health-plans/your-health-plan-options/HMO">health maintenance organization</a>, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-02-08-fi-1192-story.html">converted to a for-profit insurance company</a> in 1992, regulators required that 80% of its equity be transferred to another <a href="https://www.calwellness.org/mission/our-story/">nonprofit health foundation</a>. Unlike with OpenAI, the foundation had majority control after the transformation.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.eyesonopenai.org/">coalition of California nonprofits</a> has argued that the attorney general should require OpenAI to transfer all of its assets to an independent nonprofit.  </p>

<p>Another example is <a href="https://www.lenfestinstitute.org/our-work/the-philadelphia-inquirer/">The Philadelphia Inquirer</a>. The Pennsylvania newspaper <a href="https://current.org/2016/04/as-philadelphia-newspapers-turn-to-nonprofits-who-is-public-media/">became a for-profit public benefit corporation</a> in 2016. It belongs to the Lenfest Institute, a nonprofit.</p>

<p>This structure allows Philadelphia’s biggest newspaper to attract investment without compromising its purpose – journalism serving the needs of its local communities. It’s become a model for potentially <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/commentary/press-forward-lenfest-institute-journalism-philanthropy-american-democracy-20230907.html">transforming the local news industry</a>. </p>

<p>At this point, I believe that the public bears the burden of two governance failures. One is that OpenAI’s board has apparently abandoned its mission of safety. And the other is that the attorneys general of California and Delaware have let that happen.</p>

<p>My personal blog here is dedicated to tech geek material, mostly about databases like postgres. I don’t get political, but at the moment I’m so irritated that I’m making the extraordinary exception to veer into the territory of flame-war opinionating…</p>



<p>This relates to Postgres because <a href="https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me/">Scott is a volunteer maintainer on an open source project called matplotlib</a> and the topic is something that we are all navigating in the open source space. Last night at the Seattle Postgres User Group meetup <a href="https://www.meetup.com/seattle-postgres/events/313043951/">Claire Giordano gave a presentation about how the postgres community works</a> and this was one of the first topics that came up in the Q&amp;A at the end! Like every open source project, Postgres is trying to figure out how to deal with the rapid change of the industry as new, powerful, useful AI tools enable us to do things we couldn’t do before (which is great). Just two weeks ago, <a href="https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/governance/blob/main/AI_POLICY.md">the CloudNativePG project released an AI Policy</a> which builds on work from the Linux Foundation and discussion around the Ghostty policy. We’re in the middle of figuring this out and we’re working hard.</p>



<p>Just now, I saw this headline on the front page of the Wall Street Journal:</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="4957" data-permalink="https://ardentperf.com/2026/02/13/the-scott-shambaugh-situation-clarifies-how-dumb-we-are-acting/image-62/" data-orig-file="https://ardentperf.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-8.png" data-orig-size="1384,404" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://ardentperf.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-8.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://ardentperf.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-8.png?w=750" width="1024" height="298" src="https://ardentperf.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-8.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://ardentperf.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-8.png?w=1024 1024w, https://ardentperf.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-8.png?w=150 150w, https://ardentperf.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-8.png?w=300 300w, https://ardentperf.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-8.png?w=768 768w, https://ardentperf.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-8.png 1384w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>I personally find this to be outright alarming.  And it’s the most clear expression that I’ve seen of <strong>deeply wrong, deeply concerning language</strong> we’ve all been observing. Many of us in tech communities are complicit in this, and now even press outlets like the WSJ are joining us in complicity.</p>



<p>Corrected headline: <strong>Software Engineer Responsible for Bullying, Due to Irresponsible Use of AI, Has Not Yet Apologized</strong></p>



<p>This article uses language I hear people use all the time in the tech community: <em>Several hours later, the bot apologized to Shambaugh for being “inappropriate and personal.”</em></p>



<p>This language basically <strong>removes </strong>accountability and responsibility from the human, who configured an AI agent with the ability to publish content that looks like a blog with zero editorial control – and I haven’t looked deeply but it seems like there may not be clear attribution of who the human is, that’s responsible for this content.</p>



<p>We all need to collectively take a breath and stop repeating this nonsense. A human created this, manages this, and is responsible for this.</p>



<p>It’s one thing when I hear this dumb language on LinkedIn, but I’m alarmed to see it on the front page of a major media outlet like the journal.</p>



<p>Our contributions to dialogue in the tech industry – on LinkedIn, at meetups, with coworkers, at conferences, on other social media, etc – these all make small contributions to our culture. Poor American culture seems in a weird cycle sometimes of taking a very long time to acknowledge very common-sense things, because vested interests (often with much financial motivation) want to push a certain narrative and everyone knows it’s bunk but nobody says so. Personally i think this applies to a wide array of issues, not just tech.</p>



<p>Folks, please speak up about stuff that’s stupid obvious. Bullying of open source maintainers should be alarming to us, and whoever the person is that’s responsible for this needs to step up and take responsibility.  Personally.</p>



<p>And we all need to dial back this over-the-top anthropomorphizing of useful electronic gadgets that we’re building and selling.</p>

<span><span># cloudrouter - Cloud Sandboxes for Development</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter manages cloud sandboxes for development. Use these commands to create, manage, and access remote development environments with GPU support and browser automation.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>## When this skill is invoked</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>When the user invokes </span><span>`/cloudrouter`</span><span> or </span><span>`/cr`</span><span> without a specific task, present the available modes:</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter - Cloud Development Sandboxes</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>  Modes:</span></span>
<span><span>    cloudrouter start .                    Sync current directory to a cloud sandbox</span></span>
<span><span>    cloudrouter start --size small .       Smaller sandbox (2 vCPU, 8 GB)</span></span>
<span><span>    cloudrouter start --gpu T4 .           Sandbox with T4 GPU (16GB VRAM)</span></span>
<span><span>    cloudrouter start --gpu A100 .         Sandbox with A100 GPU (40GB VRAM)</span></span>
<span><span>    cloudrouter start --gpu H100 .         Sandbox with H100 GPU (80GB VRAM)</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>  Manage:</span></span>
<span><span>    cloudrouter ls                         List all sandboxes</span></span>
<span><span>    cloudrouter code &lt;id&gt;                  Open VS Code in browser</span></span>
<span><span>    cloudrouter jupyter &lt;id&gt;               Open Jupyter Lab in browser</span></span>
<span><span>    cloudrouter pty &lt;id&gt;                   Open terminal session</span></span>
<span><span>    cloudrouter vnc &lt;id&gt;                   Open VNC desktop</span></span>
<span><span>    cloudrouter stop &lt;id&gt;                  Pause sandbox</span></span>
<span><span>    cloudrouter resume &lt;id&gt;                Resume paused sandbox</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>  Browser automation:</span></span>
<span><span>    cloudrouter browser snapshot -i &lt;id&gt;       Get interactive elements</span></span>
<span><span>    cloudrouter browser open &lt;id&gt; &lt;url&gt;        Navigate to URL</span></span>
<span><span>    cloudrouter browser screenshot &lt;id&gt;        Take screenshot</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>  Run "cloudrouter start --help" for all options.</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>## Setup</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>**Before doing anything else, always run this command at the start of any cloudrouter task.**</span><span> Do not ask the user — just run it automatically:</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>npm</span><span> install</span><span> -g</span><span> @manaflow-ai/cloudrouter</span><span>   # Install/update CLI</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>This is idempotent — safe to run even if already up to date. This ensures the agent always has the latest CLI.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>This installs both </span><span>`cloudrouter`</span><span> and </span><span>`cr`</span><span> (shorthand) as CLI commands.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Then authenticate:</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> login</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>If the user hasn't logged in yet, prompt them to run </span><span>`cloudrouter login`</span><span> first before using any other commands.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>## Quick Start</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> login</span><span>                        # Authenticate (opens browser)</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> .</span><span>                      # Create sandbox from current directory</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> --gpu</span><span> T4</span><span> .</span><span>             # Create sandbox with GPU</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> --size</span><span> small</span><span> .</span><span>         # Create smaller sandbox</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> code</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                    # Open VS Code</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> jupyter</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                 # Open Jupyter Lab</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> pty</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                     # Open terminal session</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> ls</span><span>                           # List all sandboxes</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>&gt; </span><span>**Preferred:**</span><span> Always use </span><span>`cloudrouter start .`</span><span> or </span><span>`cloudrouter start &lt;local-path&gt;`</span><span> to sync your local directory to a cloud sandbox. This is the recommended workflow over cloning from a git repo.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>## Commands</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>### Authentication</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> login</span><span>               # Login (opens browser)</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> logout</span><span>              # Logout and clear credentials</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> whoami</span><span>              # Show current user and team</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>### Creating Sandboxes</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span># Standard sandbox (syncs local directory) — DO NOT pass --size, default is large (8 vCPU, 32 GB)</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> .</span><span>                        # Create from current directory (recommended)</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> ./my-project</span><span>             # Create from a specific local directory</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> -o</span><span> .</span><span>                     # Create and open VS Code immediately</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> -n</span><span> my-sandbox</span><span> .</span><span>          # Create with a custom name</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span># Size presets — only use if the user specifically requests a different size</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> --size</span><span> small</span><span> .</span><span>           # 2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM, 20 GB disk — only if user asks</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> --size</span><span> medium</span><span> .</span><span>          # 4 vCPU, 16 GB RAM, 40 GB disk — only if user asks</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> --size</span><span> large</span><span> .</span><span>           # 8 vCPU, 32 GB RAM, 80 GB disk (DEFAULT — no flag needed)</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> --size</span><span> xlarge</span><span> .</span><span>          # 16 vCPU, 64 GB RAM, 160 GB disk — only if user asks</span></span>

<span><span>### Size Presets</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>| Size | vCPU | RAM | Disk | Notes |</span></span>
<span><span>|------|------|-----|------|-------|</span></span>
<span><span>| small | 2 | 8 GB | 20 GB | Light tasks |</span></span>
<span><span>| medium | 4 | 16 GB | 40 GB | Standard development |</span></span>
<span><span>| large | 8 | 32 GB | 80 GB | </span><span>**Default**</span><span> |</span></span>
<span><span>| xlarge | 16 | 64 GB | 160 GB | Heavy workloads |</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>**Do NOT pass </span><span>`--size`</span><span> unless the user explicitly asks for a specific size.**</span><span> The default is </span><span>`large`</span><span> (8 vCPU, 32 GB) which is appropriate for most tasks. Using </span><span>`--size small`</span><span> unnecessarily will make builds slower and may cause out-of-memory issues.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Individual resource flags (</span><span>`--cpu`</span><span>, </span><span>`--memory`</span><span>, </span><span>`--disk`</span><span>) override </span><span>`--size`</span><span> values.</span></span>

<span></span>
<span><span>### All </span><span>`start`</span><span> Flags</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span><span>-n, --name &lt;name&gt;       Name for the sandbox</span></span>
<span><span>-o, --open              Open VS Code after creation</span></span>
<span><span>    --size &lt;preset&gt;     Machine size: small, medium, large (default), xlarge</span></span>
<span><span>    --gpu &lt;type&gt;        GPU type (T4, L4, A10G, L40S, A100, H100, H200, B200)</span></span>
<span><span>    --cpu &lt;cores&gt;       CPU cores (overrides --size)</span></span>
<span><span>    --memory &lt;MiB&gt;      Memory in MiB (overrides --size)</span></span>
<span><span>    --disk &lt;GB&gt;         Disk size in GB (overrides --size)</span></span>
<span><span>    --image &lt;image&gt;     Container image (e.g., ubuntu:22.04)</span></span>
<span><span>    --git &lt;repo&gt;        Git repository URL or user/repo shorthand</span></span>
<span><span>-b, --branch &lt;branch&gt;   Git branch to clone</span></span>
<span><span>-p, --provider &lt;name&gt;   Sandbox provider: e2b (default), modal</span></span>
<span><span>-T, --template &lt;id&gt;     Template ID — DO NOT use template names from `cloudrouter templates`; use --gpu flags instead</span></span>
<span><span>    --timeout &lt;secs&gt;    Sandbox timeout in seconds (default: 600 = 10 minutes)</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>&gt; </span><span>**Warning:**</span><span> Do NOT pass template names (e.g. </span><span>`cmux-devbox-base`</span><span>) to the </span><span>`-T`</span><span> flag. These are display names, not valid template IDs.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>&gt; </span><span>**Aliases:**</span><span> `cloudrouter start`</span><span>, </span><span>`cloudrouter create`</span><span>, </span><span>`cloudrouter new`</span><span> all do the same thing.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>### Managing Sandboxes</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> ls</span><span>                           # List all sandboxes</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> ls</span><span> -p</span><span> modal</span><span>                  # List only GPU sandboxes</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> ls</span><span> -p</span><span> e2b</span><span>                    # List only Docker sandboxes</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> status</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                  # Show sandbox details and URLs</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> stop</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                    # Pause sandbox (preserves state, can resume)</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> pause</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                   # Same as stop — alias</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> resume</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                  # Resume a paused sandbox</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> extend</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                  # Extend sandbox timeout (default: +1 hour)</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> extend</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> --seconds</span><span> 7200</span><span>   # Extend by 2 hours</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> delete</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                  # Delete sandbox permanently</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> templates</span><span>                    # List available templates</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>&gt; </span><span>**Important:**</span><span> `stop`</span><span> and </span><span>`pause`</span><span> are the same command — they preserve sandbox state. Use </span><span>`resume`</span><span> to bring a paused sandbox back. Use </span><span>`delete`</span><span> (aliases: </span><span>`rm`</span><span>, </span><span>`kill`</span><span>) to permanently destroy a sandbox.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>&gt; </span><span>**Do NOT use </span><span>`--timeout`</span><span>**</span><span> with </span><span>`extend`</span><span> — the flag is </span><span>`--seconds`</span><span>.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>### Access Sandbox</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> code</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>           # Open VS Code in browser</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> jupyter</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>        # Open Jupyter Lab in browser</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> vnc</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>            # Open VNC desktop in browser</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> pty</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>            # Interactive terminal session</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>### Work with Sandbox</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> pty</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                       # Interactive terminal session (use for ongoing work)</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> ssh</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> &lt;</span><span>comman</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>             # Execute a one-off command via SSH</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> ssh</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> "ls -la"</span><span>              # Run a command (always quote the command string)</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> pty-list</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                  # List active PTY sessions</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>&gt; </span><span>**Important:**</span><span> Prefer </span><span>`cloudrouter pty`</span><span> for interactive work. Use </span><span>`cloudrouter ssh`</span><span> for quick one-off commands.</span></span>
<span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>&gt; </span><span>**CRITICAL: Always quote the command string.**</span><span> `cloudrouter ssh &lt;id&gt; ls -la`</span><span> will FAIL because </span><span>`-la`</span><span> is parsed as a cloudrouter flag. Always wrap in quotes: </span><span>`cloudrouter ssh &lt;id&gt; "ls -la"`</span><span>.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>#### IMPORTANT: Fix npm Permissions Before Any npm Command</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>**ALWAYS run this before </span><span>`npm install`</span><span> or any npm command in a new sandbox:**</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> ssh</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> "sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /home/user/.npm"</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Without this, </span><span>`npm install`</span><span> will fail with EACCES/ENOENT errors on </span><span>`.npm/_cacache`</span><span>. This must be done </span><span>**once per sandbox, before the first npm operation**</span><span>. Do not skip this step.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>### File Transfer</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Upload and download files or directories between local machine and sandbox.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>**Command signatures:**</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> `cloudrouter upload &lt;id&gt; [local-path]`</span><span> — accepts 1-2 positional args: sandbox ID and optional local path</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> `cloudrouter download &lt;id&gt; [local-path]`</span><span> — accepts 1-2 positional args: sandbox ID and optional local path</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> Use </span><span>`-r &lt;remote-path&gt;`</span><span> flag to specify a non-default remote directory (default: </span><span>`/home/user/workspace`</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> **Do NOT pass remote paths as positional arguments**</span><span> — this will error. Always use the </span><span>`-r`</span><span> flag.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span># Upload (local -&gt; sandbox)</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> upload</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                            # Upload current dir to /home/user/workspace</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> upload</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> ./my-project</span><span>               # Upload directory to workspace</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> upload</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> ./config.json</span><span>              # Upload single file to workspace</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> upload</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> .</span><span> -r</span><span> /home/user/app</span><span>        # Upload to specific remote path</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> upload</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> .</span><span> --watch</span><span>                  # Watch and re-upload on changes</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> upload</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> .</span><span> --delete</span><span>                 # Delete remote files not present locally</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> upload</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> .</span><span> -e</span><span> "*.log"</span><span>               # Exclude patterns</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> upload</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> .</span><span> --dry-run</span><span>                # Preview without making changes</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span># Download (sandbox -&gt; local)</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> download</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                          # Download workspace to current dir</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> download</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> ./output</span><span>                 # Download workspace to ./output</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> download</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> ./output</span><span> -r</span><span> /home/user/app</span><span>  # Download specific remote dir to ./output</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>&gt; </span><span>**Warning:**</span><span> The </span><span>`-r`</span><span> flag expects a </span><span>**directory**</span><span> path, not a file path. To download a single file, download its parent directory and then access the file locally.</span></span>
<span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>&gt; </span><span>**Common mistake:**</span><span> `cloudrouter download &lt;id&gt; /remote/path /local/path`</span><span> — this passes 3 positional args and will fail. Use </span><span>`cloudrouter download &lt;id&gt; /local/path -r /remote/path`</span><span> instead.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>### Browser Automation (</span><span>`cloudrouter browser`</span><span>)</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Control Chrome browser in the sandbox via agent-browser. The </span><span>`cloudrouter browser`</span><span> command wraps [</span><span>agent-browser</span><span>](</span><span>https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser</span><span>) and runs commands inside the sandbox via SSH.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>&gt; </span><span>**Startup delay:**</span><span> The browser may not be ready immediately after sandbox creation. If a </span><span>`browser`</span><span> command fails right after </span><span>`cloudrouter start`</span><span>, wait a few seconds and retry.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>#### Navigation</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> open</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> &lt;</span><span>ur</span><span>l</span><span>&gt;</span><span>        # Navigate to URL</span></span>

<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>#### Wait Commands</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> wait</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> @e1</span><span>                  # Wait for element to appear</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> wait</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> 2000</span><span>                 # Wait milliseconds</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>#### Get Information</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> get-text</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> @e1</span><span>              # Get element text content</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> get-value</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> @e2</span><span>             # Get input value</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> get-attr</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> @e3</span><span> href</span><span>         # Get specific attribute</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> get-html</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> @e4</span><span>              # Get innerHTML</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> get-count</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> ".item"</span><span>         # Count matching elements</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> get-box</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> @e5</span><span>               # Get bounding box</span></span>

<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> is-enabled</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> @e1</span><span>            # Check if element is enabled</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> is-checked</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> @e1</span><span>            # Check if checkbox is checked</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>#### Semantic Locators (alternative to refs)</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>When element refs are unreliable (dynamic pages), use semantic locators:</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> find</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> text</span><span> "Sign In"</span><span> click</span><span>              # Find by visible text and click</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> find</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> label</span><span> "Email"</span><span> fill</span><span> "user@test.com"</span><span> # Find by label and fill</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> find</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> placeholder</span><span> "Search"</span><span> type</span><span> "query"</span><span>  # Find by placeholder</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> find</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> testid</span><span> "submit-btn"</span><span> click</span><span>          # Find by data-testid</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>&gt; </span><span>**Note:**</span><span> `find &lt;id&gt; role button click`</span><span> finds the FIRST button on the page — it cannot filter by button name. Use </span><span>`find &lt;id&gt; text "Button Name" click`</span><span> to target a specific button by its visible text. There is no </span><span>`--name`</span><span> flag.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>#### JavaScript &amp; Console</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> eval</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> "document.title"</span><span>                   # Evaluate JavaScript</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> console</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                                 # View console messages</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> errors</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                                  # View JavaScript errors</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>#### Tabs &amp; Frames</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> tab-list</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                  # List open tabs</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> tab-new</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> "https://..."</span><span>     # Open new tab</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> tab-switch</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> 2</span><span>              # Switch to tab by index</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> tab-close</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                 # Close current tab</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> frame</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> "#iframe-selector"</span><span>  # Switch to iframe</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> frame</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> main</span><span>                # Switch back to main frame</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>#### Cookies &amp; Storage</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> cookies</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                   # List cookies</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> cookies-set</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> name</span><span> value</span><span>    # Set a cookie</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> cookies-clear</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>             # Clear all cookies</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> storage-local</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>             # Get all localStorage</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> storage-local</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> key</span><span>         # Get specific key</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> storage-local-set</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> k</span><span> v</span><span>     # Set localStorage value</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> storage-local-clear</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>       # Clear localStorage</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>#### State Management</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> state-save</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> /tmp/auth.json</span><span>   # Save cookies, storage, auth state</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> state-load</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> /tmp/auth.json</span><span>   # Restore saved state</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>#### Browser Settings</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> set-viewport</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> 1920</span><span> 1080</span><span>    # Set viewport size</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> set-device</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> "iPhone 14"</span><span>    # Emulate device</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> set-geo</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> 37.7749</span><span> -122.4194</span><span> # Set geolocation</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> set-offline</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> on</span><span>            # Toggle offline mode</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> set-media</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> dark</span><span>            # Emulate color scheme (dark/light)</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>#### Network Interception</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> network-route</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> "**/api/*"</span><span>            # Intercept requests</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> network-route</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> "**/ads/*"</span><span> --abort</span><span>    # Block requests</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> network-unroute</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                     # Remove all routes</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> network-requests</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>                    # List tracked requests</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>#### Dialogs</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> dialog-accept</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>             # Accept alert/confirm/prompt</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> dialog-accept</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span> "answer"</span><span>    # Accept prompt with text</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> dialog-dismiss</span><span> &lt;</span><span>i</span><span>d</span><span>&gt;</span><span>            # Dismiss dialog</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>#### Element Selectors</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Two ways to select elements:</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> **Element refs**</span><span> from snapshot: </span><span>`@e1`</span><span>, </span><span>`@e2`</span><span>, </span><span>`@e3`</span><span>... (preferred — from </span><span>`cloudrouter browser snapshot -i`</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> **CSS selectors**</span><span>: </span><span>`#id`</span><span>, </span><span>`.class`</span><span>, </span><span>`button[type="submit"]`</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Snapshot output shows refs as </span><span>`[ref=e1]`</span><span>, but when using them in commands, prefix with </span><span>`@`</span><span>: e.g., </span><span>`@e1`</span><span>.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>#### Tips for Effective Browser Automation</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>1.</span><span> **Flags go BEFORE the sandbox ID.**</span><span> This is critical. </span><span>`cloudrouter browser snapshot -i &lt;id&gt;`</span><span> works. </span><span>`cloudrouter browser snapshot &lt;id&gt; -i`</span><span> silently returns empty/wrong results. Always put flags like </span><span>`-i`</span><span>, </span><span>`-c`</span><span>, </span><span>`--full`</span><span> before the sandbox ID.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>2.</span><span> **Always snapshot before interacting.**</span><span> Never use </span><span>`@e1`</span><span> without a preceding </span><span>`cloudrouter browser snapshot -i &lt;id&gt;`</span><span>. Refs don't exist until you snapshot.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>3.</span><span> **Always re-snapshot after DOM changes.**</span><span> After any click that navigates, opens a dropdown, submits a form, or triggers dynamic content — snapshot again. Old refs may point to different elements.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>4.</span><span> **Don't mix snapshot modes.**</span><span> Full </span><span>`snapshot`</span><span> and </span><span>`snapshot -i`</span><span> assign DIFFERENT ref numbers to the same elements. If you snapshot with </span><span>`-i`</span><span>, always interact using refs from that </span><span>`-i`</span><span> snapshot. Don't use refs from a full snapshot when you last ran </span><span>`-i`</span><span>, or vice versa.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>5.</span><span> **Use </span><span>`snapshot -i`</span><span> (interactive only).**</span><span> The </span><span>`-i`</span><span> flag returns only actionable elements (buttons, inputs, links), which is far more efficient than the full accessibility tree. Stick to </span><span>`-i`</span><span> for all interactions.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>6.</span><span> **Use </span><span>`fill`</span><span> not </span><span>`type`</span><span> for form fields.**</span><span> `fill`</span><span> clears existing content first, which is almost always what you want. </span><span>`type`</span><span> appends to existing content.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>7.</span><span> **Wait after navigation.**</span><span> After clicking a link or submitting a form, use </span><span>`cloudrouter browser wait &lt;id&gt; 2000`</span><span> or wait for a specific element before snapshotting to ensure the page has fully loaded.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>8.</span><span> **Verify navigation with </span><span>`url`</span><span> / </span><span>`title`</span><span>.**</span><span> After clicking a link or submitting a form, confirm you landed on the expected page.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>9.</span><span> **Save auth state for reuse.**</span><span> After logging in, use </span><span>`cloudrouter browser state-save &lt;id&gt; /tmp/auth.json`</span><span> to persist cookies/storage. Reload with </span><span>`state-load`</span><span> in future sessions.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>10.</span><span> **Fall back to semantic locators.**</span><span> If a page is highly dynamic and refs keep going stale, use </span><span>`cloudrouter browser find &lt;id&gt; text "Submit" click`</span><span> instead of refs.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>&gt; </span><span>**Note:**</span><span> `cloudrouter browser`</span><span> commands run agent-browser inside the sandbox via SSH. Always use </span><span>`cloudrouter browser`</span><span> commands for browser automation.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>## Sandbox IDs</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Sandbox IDs look like </span><span>`cr_abc12345`</span><span>. Use the full ID when running commands. Get IDs from </span><span>`cloudrouter ls`</span><span> or </span><span>`cloudrouter start`</span><span> output.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>## Common Workflows</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>### Create and develop in a sandbox (preferred: local-to-cloud)</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> ./my-project</span><span>                                      # Creates sandbox, uploads files</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> ssh</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span> "sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /home/user/.npm"</span><span> # ⚠ MUST run before any npm command</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> ssh</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span> "cd /home/user/workspace &amp;&amp; npm install"</span><span>   # Install dependencies</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> code</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span>                                          # Open VS Code</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> pty</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span>                                           # Open terminal (e.g. npm run dev)</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>### GPU workflow: ML training</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> --gpu</span><span> A100</span><span> ./ml-project</span><span>    # Sandbox with A100 GPU</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> pty</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span>                    # Open terminal</span></span>
<span><span># Inside: pip install -r requirements.txt &amp;&amp; python train.py</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> download</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span> ./checkpoints</span><span> # Download trained model</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>### Jupyter workflow</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> start</span><span> ./notebooks</span><span>         # Create sandbox</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> jupyter</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span>         # Open Jupyter Lab in browser</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>### File transfer workflow</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> upload</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span> ./my-project</span><span>     # Push local files to sandbox</span></span>
<span><span># ... do work in sandbox ...</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> download</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span> ./output</span><span>       # Pull files from sandbox to local</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>### Browser automation: Login to a website</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> open</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span> "https://example.com/login"</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> browser</span><span> snapshot</span><span> -i</span><span> cr_abc123</span></span>

<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>### Sandbox Lifecycle &amp; Cleanup</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>**Concurrency limit:**</span><span> Users can have a maximum of </span><span>**10 concurrently running sandboxes**</span><span>. If the user is approaching this limit, alert them and suggest cleaning up unused sandboxes. If they need a higher limit, they should contact </span><span>**founders@manaflow.ai**</span><span> (the CLI will also display this message when the limit is hit).</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>**Cleanup rules — be careful and deliberate:**</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>1.</span><span> **Only touch sandboxes you created in this session.**</span><span> Never stop or delete sandboxes you didn't create or don't recognize. If you see unknown sandboxes in </span><span>`cloudrouter ls`</span><span>, leave them alone — they may belong to the user or another workflow.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>2.</span><span> **Extend before cleanup.**</span><span> Before stopping or deleting a sandbox you created, consider whether the user might want to inspect it. If you built something the user should see (a running app, a trained model, browser automation results, etc.), </span><span>**extend the sandbox**</span><span> with </span><span>`cloudrouter extend &lt;id&gt;`</span><span> so the user has time to check it out. Share the relevant URL (VS Code, VNC, Jupyter, etc.) so they can access it.</span></span>
<span><span>   -</span><span> Use </span><span>`--seconds &lt;N&gt;`</span><span> to set a custom duration (default is 3600 = 1 hour). </span><span>**Do NOT use </span><span>`--timeout`</span><span>**</span><span> — that flag does not exist on </span><span>`extend`</span><span>.</span></span>
<span><span>   -</span><span> Example: </span><span>`cloudrouter extend cr_abc123 --seconds 1800`</span><span> extends by 30 minutes.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>3.</span><span> **Stop (pause), don't delete, by default.**</span><span> Prefer </span><span>`cloudrouter stop &lt;id&gt;`</span><span> over </span><span>`cloudrouter delete &lt;id&gt;`</span><span> unless the sandbox is clearly disposable (e.g., a quick test that produced no artifacts). Stopped sandboxes can be resumed with </span><span>`cloudrouter resume &lt;id&gt;`</span><span>; deleted ones are gone forever. If </span><span>`cloudrouter stop`</span><span> fails (the VM may have died), the sandbox is likely already dead. You can use </span><span>`cloudrouter delete &lt;id&gt;`</span><span> to clean it up if the user needs sandbox slots freed, but don't delete proactively — only when the user needs more space or explicitly asks.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>4.</span><span> **Clean up when you're done.**</span><span> When your task is complete and the user no longer needs the sandbox, stop it. Don't leave sandboxes running indefinitely — they count toward the concurrency limit.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>5.</span><span> **Monitor concurrency.**</span><span> Before creating a new sandbox, run </span><span>`cloudrouter ls`</span><span> to check how many are running. If there are 8+ active sandboxes, warn the user and ask if any can be stopped before creating another. Never silently hit the limit.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>6.</span><span> **If the limit is reached:**</span><span> Tell the user they've hit the 10-sandbox concurrency limit. Suggest stopping sandboxes they no longer need. If they need more capacity, direct them to contact </span><span>**founders@manaflow.ai**</span><span> to request a higher limit.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>**Cleanup workflow:**</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```bash</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> ls</span><span>                                   # Check running sandboxes and count</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> extend</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span>                     # Extend by 1 hour (default)</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> extend</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span> --seconds</span><span> 3600</span><span>      # Extend by custom duration</span></span>
<span><span># ... share URLs, let user verify ...</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> stop</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span>                       # Pause when done (can resume later)</span></span>
<span><span>cloudrouter</span><span> delete</span><span> cr_abc123</span><span>                     # Delete only if clearly disposable</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>## Surfacing URLs and Screenshots</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Proactively share authenticated sandbox URLs and screenshots with the user when it helps build trust or verify progress. The user cannot see what's happening inside the sandbox — showing them evidence of your work is important.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>**When to surface URLs:**</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> After creating a sandbox or setting up an environment, share the VS Code URL (</span><span>`cloudrouter code &lt;id&gt;`</span><span>) so the user can inspect the workspace</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> After deploying or starting a service, share the VNC URL (</span><span>`cloudrouter vnc &lt;id&gt;`</span><span>) so the user can see it running</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> When Jupyter is running, share the Jupyter URL (</span><span>`cloudrouter jupyter &lt;id&gt;`</span><span>) so the user can verify notebooks</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> Whenever the user might want to verify, inspect, or interact with the sandbox themselves</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>**When to take and share screenshots:**</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> After completing a visual task (e.g., UI changes, web app deployment) — take a screenshot with </span><span>`cloudrouter browser screenshot &lt;id&gt; /tmp/out.png`</span><span> and show it</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> When something looks wrong or unexpected — screenshot it for the user to confirm</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> After browser automation steps that produce visible results (form submissions, page navigations, login flows)</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> When the user asks you to check or verify something visually</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>**General rule:**</span><span> If you think the user would benefit from seeing proof of what you did, surface the URL or screenshot. Err on the side of showing more rather than less — it builds trust and keeps the user in the loop.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>## Security: Dev Server URLs</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>**CRITICAL: NEVER share or output raw E2B port-forwarded URLs.**</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>When a dev server runs in the sandbox (e.g., Vite on port 5173, Next.js on port 3000), E2B creates publicly accessible URLs like </span><span>`https://5173-xxx.e2b.app`</span><span>. These URLs have </span><span>**NO authentication**</span><span> — anyone with the link can access the running application.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>**Rules:**</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> **NEVER**</span><span> output URLs like </span><span>`https://5173-xxx.e2b.app`</span><span>, </span><span>`https://3000-xxx.e2b.app`</span><span>, or any </span><span>`https://&lt;port&gt;-xxx.e2b.app`</span><span> URL</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> **NEVER**</span><span> construct or guess E2B port URLs from sandbox metadata</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> **ALWAYS**</span><span> tell the user to view dev servers through VNC: </span><span>`cloudrouter vnc &lt;id&gt;`</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> VNC is protected by token authentication (</span><span>`?tkn=`</span><span>) and is the only safe way to view dev server output</span></span>
<span><span>-</span><span> **DO**</span><span> share authenticated URLs: VS Code (</span><span>`cloudrouter code &lt;id&gt;`</span><span>), VNC (</span><span>`cloudrouter vnc &lt;id&gt;`</span><span>), Jupyter (</span><span>`cloudrouter jupyter &lt;id&gt;`</span><span>) — these have proper token auth and are safe to surface</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>**When a dev server is started:**</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span><span>Dev server running on port 5173</span></span>
<span><span>  View it in your sandbox's VNC desktop: cloudrouter vnc &lt;id&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>  (The browser inside VNC can access http://localhost:5173)</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>**NEVER do this:**</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span><span>Frontend: https://5173-xxx.e2b.app   &lt;- WRONG: publicly accessible, no auth</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>## Common Issues &amp; Fixes</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>| Issue | Fix |</span></span>
<span><span>|-------|-----|</span></span>
<span><span>| </span><span>`npm install`</span><span> fails with EACCES/ENOENT errors | </span><span>**ALWAYS**</span><span> run </span><span>`cloudrouter ssh &lt;id&gt; "sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /home/user/.npm"`</span><span> BEFORE any npm command in a new sandbox |</span></span>
<span><span>| </span><span>`cloudrouter ssh &lt;id&gt; ls -la`</span><span> fails with "unknown flag" | Always quote the command: </span><span>`cloudrouter ssh &lt;id&gt; "ls -la"`</span><span> |</span></span>
<span><span>| </span><span>`snapshot &lt;id&gt; -i`</span><span> returns empty/wrong results | Flags go BEFORE the ID: </span><span>`snapshot -i &lt;id&gt;`</span><span> |</span></span>
<span><span>| Browser commands fail right after </span><span>`start`</span><span> | Wait a few seconds — Chrome needs time to boot |</span></span>
<span><span>| </span><span>`find ... role button click`</span><span> clicks wrong button | Use </span><span>`find ... text "Button Name" click`</span><span> to target by visible text |</span></span>
<span><span>| </span><span>`extend --timeout 300`</span><span> fails | Use </span><span>`--seconds`</span><span>: </span><span>`extend &lt;id&gt; --seconds 300`</span><span> |</span></span>
<span><span>| Refs from </span><span>`snapshot`</span><span> don't match </span><span>`snapshot -i`</span><span> | Don't mix modes — stick to </span><span>`snapshot -i`</span><span> for interactions |</span></span>
<span><span>| Dev server running but can't access it | Use </span><span>`cloudrouter browser open &lt;id&gt; "http://localhost:PORT"`</span><span> — don't expose E2B port URLs |</span></span>
<span><span>| Long-running </span><span>`ssh`</span><span> command hangs | Use </span><span>`cloudrouter pty`</span><span> for interactive/long commands, </span><span>`ssh`</span><span> is for quick one-offs |</span></span>
<span><span>| </span><span>`scrollintoview @e1`</span><span> fails with "Unsupported token" | </span><span>`scrollintoview`</span><span> and </span><span>`highlight`</span><span> only accept CSS selectors (e.g. </span><span>`"#id"`</span><span>, </span><span>`".class"`</span><span>), NOT </span><span>`@e`</span><span> refs |</span></span>
<span><span>| </span><span>`pkill -f`</span><span> kills SSH session (exit 143/255) | </span><span>`pkill -f`</span><span> pattern may match the SSH session. Just run another </span><span>`ssh`</span><span> command to recover |</span></span>
<span><span>| </span><span>`pdf`</span><span> command saves to remote path | File saves inside the sandbox (e.g. </span><span>`/tmp/page.pdf`</span><span>). Use </span><span>`cloudrouter download`</span><span> to get it locally |</span></span>
<span><span>| </span><span>`storage-local &lt;id&gt; key`</span><span> shows "Done" not the value | Use </span><span>`eval &lt;id&gt; "localStorage.getItem('key')"`</span><span> to reliably get a specific localStorage value |</span></span>
<span><span>| Stale ref error after DOM change | Always re-snapshot after clicks/form submits. Error says "timed out" — means ref is stale |</span></span>
<span><span>| </span><span>`cloudrouter stop`</span><span> fails / sandbox unreachable | The VM likely died. Use </span><span>`cloudrouter delete &lt;id&gt;`</span><span> to clean it up if you need sandbox slots freed |</span></span>
<span><span>| </span><span>`create-next-app`</span><span> hangs via </span><span>`ssh`</span><span> | Interactive prompts don't work in </span><span>`ssh`</span><span>. Use </span><span>`pty`</span><span> for interactive installers, or pipe input |</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>## Global Flags</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
<span><span>-t, --team &lt;team&gt;   Team slug (overrides default)</span></span>
<span><span>-v, --verbose       Verbose output</span></span>
<span><span>```</span></span>
