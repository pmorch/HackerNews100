Fortunately, he was a stubborn man. Jobs immediately started the company NeXT, with the idea of taking on IBM once again.</p><p>As he developed the NeXT computer, which would launch in 1988, Jobs was looking for killer software programs to create demand for the product. From his experience at Apple, he knew that a good spreadsheet program could drive sales. Jobs credited VisiCalc, the first widely used spreadsheet software, for the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://qz.com/1103867/visicalc-and-apple-aapl-steve-jobs-said-that-the-spreadsheet-was-key-to-apples-early-success/?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=quartz-obsession&amp;utm_content=&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://qz.com/1103867/visicalc-and-apple-aapl-steve-jobs-said-that-the-spreadsheet-was-key-to-apples-early-success/?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=quartz-obsession&amp;utm_content=" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">huge success of the Apple II computer</a></span>, released in 1979.</p><p>In his search for that need-to-have product, Jobs met with software company Lotus. The organization had already developed Lotus 1-2-3, a popular spreadsheet program that ran on IBM computers. It was in these meetings that Jobs would first stumble upon the “pivot table.”</p><p>Software developer Pito Salas was at the time working in research and development for Lotus, looking into how people typically utilize spreadsheets. Salas saw that users would often use spreadsheets to try to calculate summary statistics by categories (often referred to as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.displayr.com/what-is-a-crosstab/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.displayr.com/what-is-a-crosstab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crosstabs</a></span>). For example, a company selling bicycles might want to examine their data to find unit sales by month or revenue by country. The way people did that at the time was cumbersome and error-prone because it involved writing complicated formulas.</p><p>Salas decided the world needed software that would make those calculations simple. Rather than enter formulas, users would be able to point and click to get those summary statistics. The Lotus team called this tool “flexible views,” but today similar tools are called “pivot tables” in both Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets.</p><p>The Lotus team showed Jobs an early prototype. “Steve Jobs thought it was the coolest thing ever,” Salas, now a professor at Brandeis University, tells Quartz. Jobs then convinced Lotus to develop the pivot table software exclusively for the NeXT computer. The software came out as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rittmanmead.com/blog/2005/10/looking-back-at-lotus-improv/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rittmanmead.com/blog/2005/10/looking-back-at-lotus-improv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lotus Improv</a></span>, and though the NeXT computer was a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/09/12/looking-back-at-steve-jobss-next-inc----the-most-successful-failure-ever&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/09/12/looking-back-at-steve-jobss-next-inc----the-most-successful-failure-ever" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commercial failure</a></span>, Lotus Improv would be hugely influential. The “flexible views” aspect of Improv would be built into both Lotus 1-2-3 and Excel (the latter was the first to actually use the term “pivot table”).</p><p>Bill Jelen, <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Pivot-Table-Data-Crunching-Jelen/dp/0789734354?asc_campaign=kinjaquartzlink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://qz.com/1903322/why-pivot-tables-are-the-spreadsheets-most-powerful-tool&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjaquartzlink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-amazonasin="0789734354" data-amazontag="kinjaquartzlink-20">Excel evangelist</a></span> and co-author of <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Pivot-Table-Data-Crunching-Jelen/dp/0789734354?asc_campaign=kinjaquartzlink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://qz.com/1903322/why-pivot-tables-are-the-spreadsheets-most-powerful-tool&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjaquartzlink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-amazonasin="0789734354" data-amazontag="kinjaquartzlink-20"><em>Pivot Table Data Crunching</em></a></span>, credits Salas as the “father of pivot tables.” Salas says his contribution to pivot tables is one of his life’s most gratifying accomplishments, though he believes he was just building on the foundations of many others.</p><p>Today, pivot tables are among the most important and commonly used tools in the spreadsheet wizard’s toolbox. “A pivot table lets you create a one-page summary report from hundreds of thousands of rows of data, often in four, five, or six clicks,” says Jelen. “It is the fastest way to get answers from large datasets.”</p><p> It’s hard to know exactly how many people use Excel in their day-to-day work, but there are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.computerworld.com/article/3315737/use-microsoft-excel-to-learn-about-data-analytics.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3315737/use-microsoft-excel-to-learn-about-data-analytics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hundreds of millions of Excel users worldwide</a></span> and it stands to reason that many have picked up the software’s most powerful tool.

Recently, a reporter at Quartz got access to data on remittances sent from the US to Mexico by month going back to 1995. But what the reporter really needed was a summary of the total remittances in the first six months of each year. Pivot tables were the way to go. Getting the numbers she needed involved inserting a pivot table, making a few selections to choose the data she needed, and filtering out the months she wanted to exclude.

The shift sought “to raise the prices against the highest bidder,” Whinston told Judge Amit Mehta in federal court in Washington.</p><p>Google’s advertising auctions require the winner to pay only a penny more than the runner-up. In 2016, the company discovered that the runner-up had often bid only 80% of the winner’s offer. To help eliminate that 20% between the runner-up and what the winner was willing to pay, Google gave the second-place bidder a built-in handicap to make their offer more competitive, Whinston said, citing internal emails and sealed testimony by Google finance executive Jerry Dischler earlier in the case.</p><p>“It’s really easy to slip into the thought that it’s an auction and an auction is competition,” Whinston said, explaining how Google’s ability to tweak the rules demonstrates its monopoly over online advertising. But “it’s the advertisers who are running in this race. It’s Google setting the rules.”</p><p>The Justice Department alleges that Google has illegally maintained a monopoly over online search by paying billions of dollars to web browsers and smartphone manufacturers to ensure it’s the preselected option for users accessing the web. As part of those deals, Google pays Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and others a share of the revenue it earns from search advertising.</p><p>About two-thirds, more than 60%, of Google’s total revenue comes from search ads, Dischler said previously, amounting to more than $100 billion in 2020. Every year since 2012, the company’s search ad revenue growth has been in the “high teens,” according to documents shown by the Justice Department.</p><p>Dischler testified on Sept. 19 that Google sometimes tweaked its advertising auctions to ensure it met revenue targets, but most of his testimony occurred in a sealed session. Whinston’s comments Friday described Google’s technique, called “squashing,” that seeks to make the runner-up’s bid more competitive. Google estimated that technique along with charging more for ads that used more words in their text would increase revenues by 15%.</p><p>“Google has not been transparent about what they are doing” with pricing, Whinston said. But advertisers “do have ways of finding out even if they don’t know exactly what Google is doing.”</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-08/bond-market-pain-is-a-sign-of-interest-rates-returning-to-normal?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Free-Money Experiment Is Over;elm:context_link;itc:0">The Free-Money Experiment Is Over</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-03/can-ai-pick-stocks-better-than-wall-street-firms-are-trying?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Can AI Beat the Market?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      <p>I stumbled upon <a href="https://youtu.be/V_ZdvrIMKEQ">this Hardware Haven video about the Zimaboard recently.</a></p>
<p>I liked it a lot.</p>
<p>I finally bought one.</p>






  




<figure>
    <a href="https://ounapuu.ee/posts/2023/10/09/zimaboard/media/cover.jpg">
	<img src="https://ounapuu.ee/posts/2023/10/09/zimaboard/media/cover_hu2c08a0a24f9b2677477296053ae56db2_2448960_1024x0_resize_q80_box.jpg" width="1024" height="1365">

<p>In short, <a href="https://www.zimaboard.com/zimaboard/product">Zimaboard</a> is a small single-board computer that is relatively affordable and comes
with an interesting selection of ports, which includes an exposed PCI Express port.</p>
<p>Before we get down to the build, here’s a list of aspects that I want to see in my dream home server:</p>
<ul>
<li>low power usage (2-15W typical power usage)</li>
<li>8GB of RAM or better</li>
<li>enough performance to run my workloads, most of which are containerized</li>
<li>2x SATA or NVMe SSD slots, plus option for a third drive for the OS</li>
<li>passively cooled and completely silent</li>
<li>compact size</li>
<li>gigabit Ethernet or better</li>
</ul>
<p>You might be thinking, “<em>Wait, that’s your <strong>dream setup</strong>? No clusters of machines, Threadrippers, 10 Gigabit networking, crazy number of disks?</em>”.
Well, yes. After years of trying all sorts of setups and learning about my home server usage patterns, this is the set of requirements that finds a balance between performance, efficiency
and silence.</p>
<h3 id="basics">Basics</h3>
<p>I recommend checking <a href="https://www.zimaboard.com/zimaboard/product">the product page</a> to see the exact specifications.
The configuration I bought was the 832 model: 8GB of RAM, 32GB of eMMC storage and a quad-core Intel Celeron N3450 CPU.
It’s not the most powerful setup or even a recent one with the CPU being from 2016, but it’s just powerful enough to fit
my needs.</p>
<p>This variant of the board costs 200 USD, but other configurations cost much less
than that, I just needed the extra memory to be on the safe side. If you don’t
care about the noise and size aspect of home servers, then you can get a better
deal on the used market (<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/introducing-project-tinyminimicro-home-lab-revolution/">see the TinyMiniMicro project for inspiration)</a>,
but as you know by this point, I care about those aspects a lot.</p>
<h3 id="the-package">The package</h3>
<p>What sets the Zimaboard apart from other single board computers is how polished the product feels.
Unlike a board like the Raspberry Pi, this one comes with a case and a cooling setup
already attached to it. I suspect that a similarily configured Raspberry Pi 4/5
with all the accessories added on top would result in a price that’s quite
similar to the cost of a top-of-the-line Zimaboard.</p>
<p>The heatsink looks great and is practical at the same time.
Under the most torturous loads I could only see the CPU being around 72°C and due
to it being passively cooled it made absolutely no noise. With the case being
present, I do not have to worry about placing the board on my desk and scratching
the table or shorting something out.</p>

<p>The board does not seem to have a power button, but by default it’s configured
to power on as soon as you connect the power supply, which is great if you’re
going to use this as a home server.</p>
<p>The box that the board was shipped survived and overall I’d say that the packaging
is good. The board comes with some stickers and a single SATA data+power cable.
The included power adapter comes with EU, US and UK plugs all included.</p>
<p>Shipping to Estonia was quite fast, taking just 10 days. The shipping costs were
18 USD.</p>

<h3 id="storage">Storage</h3>
<p>The included 32GB eMMC storage is fine for hosting your operating system. The
read speeds cap out at around 175 MB/s and the typical write speeds I observed
were around 50-100 MB/s. The storage is identified as <code>mmc-BJTD4R_0xc7d04e40</code> under
<code>/dev/disk/by-id/</code>, and searching online suggests that it’s a Samsung chip.</p>
<p>Because this board offers two SATA ports, I also added a SATA Y-cable to my order
(4 USD) so that I can take my existing Samsung 870 QVO 4TB SATA drives and move
my home server setup to this board.</p>

SATA Y-cable in action.

</figure>

<p>Allegedly this cable can also be used to drive
two 3.5" hard drives powered by the board itself according to <a href="https://shop.zimaboard.com/products/sata-y-cable-for-zimaboard-2-5-inch-hdd-3-5-inch-hdd-raid-free-nas-unraid">the shop page
for the Y-cable</a>, but I suspect that at that point you’ll be pushing the limits of
the 12V/3A power adapter.</p>
<p>There is also a white drive activity LED
placed near the SATA power connector on the board. Perhaps not for everyone, but I
like the aesthetic and the sight of the server doing server things.</p>
<p>The performance of the SATA ports is what you would expect. When performing
read operations on both SSD-s I saw the maximum total transfer rates hover around
900-950MB/s, which is pretty close to the SATA III transfer speed limit.</p>
<p>There is no native way to mount the two SATA drives to the Zimaboard. The creators
of the board do sell a metal bracket, but it doesn’t seem to integrate that well
to the board. However, <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/224057-zimaboard-dual-hdd-stand">there exists a 3D printable design that houses two
2.5" drives, even 15mm ones</a>, and
that’s how I ended up using a 3D printer for the first time in my life.
The print was done using a <a href="https://wiki.k-space.ee/en/utilities/3D-Printer">Voron v2 Afterburner printer hosted at k-space</a>
and it came out pretty well.</p>

<p>The SSD mounting holes were a bit finicky due
to slight printing errors, and during my first installation attempt I forgot to
put in the plastic middle layer of the case that’s between the PCB and the stock
bottom cover, but other than that the installation was a breeze.</p>

<p>The drives never hit above 64°C, which is absolutely okay for these SSD-s. I’m not
sure how actual spinning hard drives might fare in this environment, but I don’t
think that it’s going to be that serious because 2.5" hard drives should not
generate as much heat in the first place.</p>
<h3 id="power-consumption">Power consumption</h3>
<p>What I love about this board is the power usage. At this point my home server
is not even the most power hungry component of my setup, that honor now goes
to the ISP-provided router/modem combo box that always draws at least 12W, even
when it’s in bridge mode.</p>
<p>Here are my power usage measurements (measured with a simple power meter):</p>
<ul>
<li>idle: 2.5W</li>
<li>no drives attached, CPU stress test (<code>stress -c 4</code>): 9.0W</li>
<li>one Samsung 870 QVO 4TB SSD attached, CPU stress test: 13.2W</li>
<li>2 SSD-s attached, typical power draw in my setup (~10-40% CPU usage): ~8-9W</li>
<li>2 SSD-s attached, max load on SSD-s and CPU: ~14W</li>
</ul>
<p>The Zimaboard, ISP modem/router box, my TP-Link router/Wi-Fi AP and my CyberPower
UPS all together use at most around 34W, all combined. That’s even less than
what my Dell monitor uses at reasonably low brightness levels!</p>
<p>These tests are not scientifically accurate, but they should give you an idea on what
power consumption numbers to expect when running this setup.</p>
<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>
<p>I use a simple Prometheus Node Exporter + Grafana setup to view how much resources
my various servers use. My home server has lately either been an <a href="https://ounapuu.ee/2022/01/17/asrock-x300-future-of-desktops/">ASRock Deskmini X300 based setup</a> or
an <a href="https://ounapuu.ee/posts/2022/05/10/thinkpad-as-a-home-server/">old ThinkPad T430</a>, and something that both had in common was that the CPU usage was
generally very low, mostly at or below the 10% mark. There would be bursty loads
from time to time and backup processes running that bump that up, but not significantly.</p>

<p>Memory usage of my setup was also quite low, with all my services and containers
fitting into 2GB during typical usage. With this information and some CPU performance
comparisons done, I knew that the Zimaboard will likely be able to handle my home
server tasks.</p>
<p>This board is not very powerful, but if you mainly rely on containerized workloads
and can rely on Intel QuickSync to accelerate media transcodes, then you’ll be
just fine.</p>

<p>I was actually impressed with how well the GPU-accelerated transcode
worked on this machine once you set everything up properly.
If you’re running Linux and Jellyfin,
run <code>vainfo</code> to get a list of supported codecs and make sure that you have hardware
decoding selected for those in Jellyfin settings. Also enable hardware encoding.
I checked with <code>intel_gpu_top</code> to see if work was offloaded to the GPU and saw
activity there, which means that hardware acceleration for Jellyfin worked out great!

that have to be met for all of this to work.</a></p>

<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>
<p>The Zimaboard does ship with a Linux-based OS called CasaOS. However, I had no
intention of using it as I know what my requirements are and my infrastructure
is already decently documented and set up via Ansible, which is why I can’t say
how good that experience is. I also did not test Windows 10 or 11.</p>
<p>During testing, I noticed that the USB 3 ports can act a bit weird. The Fedora
Server USB stick would not boot properly if connected to one of the USB ports,
and when doing other tests with external USB storage I noticed hiccups from time to time.
Not sure what might be the cause, but I’m writing it down nevertheless. It’s not
a dealbreaker for me luckily since I don’t rely much on the USB ports in typical use anyway.</p>
<p>I did not test the PCI Express port, simply because I don’t need it, yet. It’s
a great addition, though, and opens up plenty of modding capabilities in the
future.</p>
<h3 id="fedora-server-and-btrfs">Fedora Server and btrfs</h3>
<p>The Zimaboard gave me an opportunity to start fresh with my home server.</p>
<p>I made a leap: I’ve ditched ZFS and am now running
Fedora Server with my storage being on a btrfs RAID1 setup, snapshotted
and backed up using <a href="https://ounapuu.ee/posts/2022/07/09/btrbk-is-awesome/">btrbk</a>.
It was a bit tricky to migrate and set everything
up regarding backups and snapshotting, but I got it working.</p>
<p>ZFS is great, but it has always felt like an unwanted guest in the Linux ecosystem.
The kernel developers don’t care much for maintaining compatibility with ZFS since
it’s not in the kernel due to licensing issues, and Ubuntu has been one of the few
distros that actually ships a kernel that includes ZFS built in. I didn’t want
to be tied to Ubuntu forever, especially because of how they try to make <code>snap</code>
a thing. ZFS DKMS builds are generally okay on distros like Debian, but on
others you might find yourself not being able to access your data after a reboot
because of a kernel update.</p>
<p>btrfs has had some issues in the past, especially with the RAID5/6 setup, but
in my single and dual disk setups it has been solid for years, except for that one time around
2018-2019 when I ran btrfs RAID1 over USB storage. To be fair to btrfs, that
was a pretty stupid setup.</p>
<p>Before committing
to btrfs, I used two USB sticks to create a RAID1 setup and created real torture test scenarios.
Tests looked something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>write a file to the filesystem</li>
<li>use <code>md5sum</code> to calculate a hash of it for verification purposes</li>
<li>completely wipe one USB drive with <code>dd</code></li>
<li>run <code>md5sum</code> to calculate the hash again (it matched every time)</li>
<li>run <code>btrfs scrub</code> on the filesystem to fix all errors</li>
<li>rinse and repeat with variations to this setup</li>
</ul>
<p>After doing all that, I was quite confident that this was going to work.</p>
<p>One thing to note with <code>btrfs</code>: if you’re running any type of multi-disk and
redundant setup like RAID1 or RAID10, then make sure to include the mount option
<code>degraded</code> in <code>/etc/fstab</code> so that you can still mount your filesystem if one or
more of your drives fail. If you lose too many drives then it’s still probably going to fail to boot.</p>
<p>Here’s my <code>/etc/fstab</code> setup to serve as an example:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>LABEL=turbo /turbo      btrfs subvol=turbo,compress-force=zstd:1,ssd,degraded,nofail            0 0
</code></pre><p>When doing the migration I kept all the paths the same, and each ZFS dataset
was recreated using <code>btrfs</code> subvolumes, which is why this filesystem is mounted on a top-level folder.</p>
<h3 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h3>
<p>My notes for the next dream home server setup included a few candidates:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Zimaboard</li>
<li><a href="https://www.asustor.com/en/product?p_id=79">Asustor Flashstor 6</a> or <a href="https://www.asustor.com/en/product?p_id=80">Flashstor 12</a></li>
<li>a TinyMiniMicro style machine with at least two NVMe SSD slots</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two fall nicely into my requirements for the dream home server. I picked
the Zimaboard mainly because it’s much cheaper and I was already running two SATA SSD-s
for my home server storage, so migrating would be really easy and I would not
have to buy any new drives.</p>
<p>If large capacity SATA SSD-s start becoming less common and NVMe SSD-s become
even cheaper than they already are, then I’ll have to look into something like a Flashstor.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Overall, I’m very happy with this purchase. The performance is just enough for
my services to work reasonably fast, the board uses very little power and it’s
silent, and it looks good on my wall.</p>

<p>My setup is also quite flexible, so in case I need more resources, I can get
more Zimaboards and make them serve different purposes. However, it’s more likely
that I’m going to discover a new toy to experiment and play with by the time
I run out of resources on this one.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
            <div>
      
      <p>
	October 8th 2023
      </p>
      <p>
	Ardour 8.0 is available now for Linux, Windows, and macOS, including the latest release of macOS, Sonoma.  Along with the usual set of
	important and not-so-important bug fixes, Ardour 8.0 brings users
	substantial quality of life benefits:
	</p><ul>
	  <li>"Quick groups" - most mix-related controls now operate on all the selected tracks &amp; busses</li>
	  <li>Manage sections of a song with arrangement
	  markers. Define your verses, chorus, and bridge. Then
	  rearrange or copy them as you wish.</li>
	  <li>Create persistent region groups in the editor window, to
	  make multi-region editing easier.</li>
	  <li>Edit velocity easily on a dedicated automation lane whether it's a single note or a chord.</li>
	  <li>Draw automation freely for any controller or press
	    Control (Command) key to enable line-drawing mode. You can
	    also combine free and line segments as you draw just by
	    pressing and releasing the Ctrl/Cmd key.</li>
	  <li>Fit the tempo map to a human performance, with a new dedicated tool.</li>
	  <li>If (e.g. drum) note names are available for a plugin instrument or
	    external device (via a MIDNAM file), see those names in the all-new MIDI track header.</li>
	  <li>Use Novation Launchpad Pro in DAW/Session mode (along with the standalone Sequencer, Note and Chord modes).</li>
	  <li>Create new interesting progressions with arpeggiator plugins.</li>
	</ul>
      <p>
	Note that there are no changes to Ardour's session file format
	with this release, so sessions created with previous versions, particularly those
	from the 7.x release series, should load with no new issues. If
	you opt to have Ardour copy over your configuration from 7.x,
	we will copy more files too, because of the lack of
	compatibility issues.
      </p>
      <p>
	Some people will no doubt laugh at a few
	of these "new features", given that they've been in some other
	DAWs for 20 years or more. That's OK — we laugh too when we see
	other DAWs finally adding things that Ardour could do in
	2005. 😃
      </p>

      <h2>New Features</h2>
    </p>
  </div>


<div>

    <h2>Lollipops for MIDI Velocity</h2>


    <p><img src="https://ardour.org/images/lollis8.png" alt="a screenshot showning the new MIDI velocity lollipops in Ardour 8.0">
    </p>
    <p>
	Ardour has offered several different workflows for adjusting MIDI note
	velocities, some of them much more convenient in many situations than
	the traditional "lollipops" (vertical bars with a dot on top used to
	alter the note velocity). However, there are some specific situations,
	particularly crescendos and diminuendos, where the ability to just
	draw a line to get rising or falling velocity is much better than
	working note by note.
	
	So, for Ardour 8.0 we have, after many user requests over a long time
	period, added the traditional velocity lollipop editing interface.

    </div>

<div>
    <p>
      <h2>Arrangement</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
      Need the ability to "arrange" a composition by easily moving
      and/or copying sections ? Ardour 8 brings a dedicated ruler to
      define those sections, and a sidebar which allows you to copy or
      reorder them as you wish. Long time audio editors will note
      this means that Ardour now supports 3-point edits: a given range
      (start, end) can be moved or copied to a destination point in
      time. 
    </p>
    
  </div>

<div>
    <p>
      <h2>New MIDI Track Piano Roll Header</h2>
    </p>
    <div>
      <p>
	Thanks to the vision of user/contributor Alexander
	Mitchell, Ardour 8 comes with a completely redesigned MIDI track
	header piano roll and scroomer. Changes include:
	</p><ul>
	  <li>All notes reach the right edge of the piano roll</li>
	  <li>Octave numbers (C3, C4 etc) are shown at all times</li>
	  <li>Note names can be displayed in the scroomer. If MIDNAM
	    data is available to provide meaningful names they will be
	    used. If not, generic MIDI note numbers and 12TET names will
	    be shown. Note names will only be shown in draw/internal edit
	    mode, and can be controlled by user preference allowing
	    "always", "never" and "when available" (the latter referring
	    to MIDNAM note name data being available). </li>
	  <li>It is now possible to record MIDI using the piano
	    roll.</li>
	  <li>Possibly more obvious user-interaction design for the
	  scroomer ("scroll" + "zoom").</li>
	</ul>
  <p>
	MIDNAM is an industry standard to provide "names" for various
	things related to MIDI. Unlike some other DAWs, we have chosen
	to use this standard for note naming rather than devising our
	own format for this information.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

<div>
    <p>
      <h2>Launchpad Pro support</h2>
    </p>
    <div>
	  <p><img src="https://ardour.org/images/lppro.webp" alt="a photograph of a Novation Launchpad Pro Mk3">
	  </p>
	  <div>
	    <p>
	      The Novation Launchpad Pro is an affordable, powerful pad/grid
	      device for controlling Ardour (it also works with at least one
	      other DAW). Ardour 8 features full support for just about every
	      feature of the LP Pro's "Session" mode, like Ableton Live. You
	      can use it to trigger clips and cues, but also control gain
	      levels, panning and send levels for tracks &amp; busses. The
	      fader design is quite something to see (be sure to read the LP
	      Pro manual about how they work). 
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      One interesting thing to note: unlike the Ableton Push
	      2, the LP Pro actually has "brains". Besides "Session"
	      mode (which is controlled by the DAW), there are 3 other
	      modes you can use: "Note", "Chord" and "Sequencer" all
	      of which function without any involvement by the
	      DAW. The LP Pro has its own fairly sophisticated MIDI
	      recorder/sequencer, and the Chord mode can be used to
	      build up progressions in an easy to perform way. The
	      modes work with Ardour just as they would in any other
	      DAW, and you can find fairly good documentation on them
	      in the LP Pro manual. There's a particularly thorough
	      playlist of
	      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_kRkcZ1CjihzcBrIO_x0JdqgwO9gKu9J">video
	      tutorials</a> on the Sequencer mode.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      We hope to announce support for the LP Pro's junior cousins, the
	      LP Mini and LP X, in the not too distant future.
	    </p>
	  </div>
	</div>
  </div>

<div>
    <p>
      <h2>Quick Groups</h2>
    </p>
      
	<div>
	  
	  <div>
	    <p>
	      For a long time, Ardour has had track &amp; bus groups
	      which could be set to share features like solo state,
	      record-enable and so on. There are also VCAs to provide
	      a different type of shared control. These were (and are!) powerful,
	      but many users have expressed a desire for more
	      spontaneous "group operations", particularly in the mixer.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      For Ardour 8.0, we have redesigned this fundamental
	      behavior of many controls so that they now apply most
	      changes to all selected tracks &amp; busses. This
	      includes: gain (fader) and input trim changes as well as
	      solo/mute/rec-enable/solo-safe/solo-isolate/monitoring
	      controls.
	    </p>
	  </div>

	    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7cKhxHCN90s" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
	  </p>
	  
	</div>
  </div>

<div>
      <p>
	Of course, if you have a group with the selection sharing property
	enabled, selecting a member of the group will select all of them, and
	then the "operate on selection" model will apply to the group.
      </p>
      <p>
	The new design allows a lot more flexibility. You can:
      </p>
	<ul>
	  <li>not use groups at all, just select the tracks/busses/mixer strips.</li>
	  <li>use groups but leave selection sharing enabled so that grouping &amp;
	    selection "look" the same (i.e. selecting 1 member of the group

	  <li>use groups but leave selection sharing disabled, allowing you to still
	    select specific members of the group (and non-members) to operate
	    on.</li>
	</ul>
      <p>
	Note that these changes will also apply to the editor
	tab/window, for whatever relevant controls are visible there.
      </p>
      <p>
	Two small notes on this: first, this behavior will not
	happen when the changes to various controls come from a
	hardware control surface. This may or may not change in
	the future - hardware control surfaces tend to have
	different conventions for use than mouse-driven
	GUIs. Second, this also will not work if you use the
	mouse scroll wheel to adjust faders. We will likely
	"fix" this sometime during the 8.x series.

      <h2>Region Grouping</h2>
    </p>

    <div>
	<p>
	  Another long standing user request has been the ability to select
	  several regions and "group" them so that they will all move or trim
	  together. Ardour 8.0 now allows this: select more than 1 region, then
	  right click on any of them, and select "Group" from the context menu
	  (or simply press <code>Ctrl-g</code> (<code>Cmd-g</code> on macOS).
	</p>
	<p>
	  Regions recorded at the same time are grouped by default so they can
	  be edited together.

      <h2>Freehand automation drawing</h2>
    </p>
    <div>
    <p>
      Ardour has for decades supported sample-accurate automation with both manual entry of control points and full automation recording. However, more than a few users have asked for the ability to use the mouse/touchpad to "draw" freehand lines rather than create them point by point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ardour 8.0 adds this style of automation drawing for any/all
      automations, including regular parameters, but also for
      per-region gain and finally MIDI CC data.
    </p>
    <p>The old (and still available) point-by-point automation
      drawing style is recommended for many things, due to reduced
      CPU load and less issues with plugins.</p>

      <source src="https://ardour.org/images/oldautodraw.webm" type="video/webm">
    </video>
    <p>The new freehand drawing style is sometimes faster to
      draw and may feel more natural to some users. Remember,
      however, that Ardour can interpolate between points, and most
      plugins will always interpolate changes in parameter values, so
      although this may "look" nicer, it's not necessarily any better
      at providing the automation "shape" you think you want.</p>

      <h2>Tempo Mapping, Round 2 — the Grid Tool</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you compose/work entirely "in the box" and/or always work
      with a click track or visual grid as a reference, most DAWs
      (including Ardour) will help you get things lined up, even
      you're leaning into Dillah-style grooves. 
    </p>
    <p>
      But if you are dealing with recordings of human performances,
      you're likely to find that no fixed grid can help you with the
      little speed ups and slow downs that give a lot of music its
      distinct feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      We've looked at the solutions offered by a bunch of other DAWs
      and found them all lacking. If you try to automate the task of
      adjusting the tempo to follow a human performance (e.g. by
      tracking transients/onsets), you
      invariably end up with a mess that you still need to manually
      fix up.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Ardour 8.0, we are proud to offer an approach to this
      problem that we think combines the best of both worlds: switch
      to the Grid tool (shortcut: "y") and simply
      drag the grid (lines) to fit the measure and beat onsets that
      you feel while listening. Start by working from the left/earlier to the
      right/later,  and then head back and tweak
      any specific beat lines that don't seem quite right.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      While this won't be useful to four-on-the-floor techno
      producers, for those working with human performances not tied to
      a click track, the result is a tempo map (and grid) that
      precisely follows the human, making it easy to align other
      material and/or generate new (MIDI) tracks that also follow the
      performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The combination of Ardour's functionality and your
      listening ability also allows you to respect particularly slack
      timing done for musical effect. Maybe the transients for the
      down beat of a given measure are not "on beat", but you can
      sense that and leave the tempo/pulse alone. The resulting grid
      accommodates the way people actually perform, rather than how
      software sometimes thinks they ought to.

	  For several years, people downloading Ardour for macOS have
	  had to deal with various kinds of messages (from Apple) saying
	  things like "This program comes from an untrusted source" to
	  "The file is damaged". As of Ardour 8, macOS users downloading
	  Ardour won't see this stuff any more, because we have given up
	  and paid $100 to join Apple's pay-to-play scheme. Our builds are

      <h2>MIDI Arpeggiator Plugins</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks to Dr. Albert Gräf, Ardour now comes with three MIDI arpeggiator plugins, which
      are intended to be added to a MIDI track before the instrument plugin. All 3 arpeggiators come
      with a number of factory presets which demonstrate their use. Dr. Gräf also provides a
       <a href="https://github.com/agraef/ardour-lua"> more detailed description</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The default <em>Arpeggiator</em> is a traditional monophonic arpeggiator which takes chords as
      MIDI input and turns them into arpeggios when transport is rolling. The arpeggiator is sample
      accurate, follows the tempo map and offers various controls to let you modify parameters such as
      velocities, octave range, and pattern mode.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <em>Barlow Arp</em> (after Clarence Barlow) automatically utilizes the current time
      signature and division to produce rhythmic accents in accordance with the meter by varying the
      note velocities in a given range.</p>
    <p>
      Last but not least, the <em>Raptor: The Random Arpeggiator</em> is an advanced arpeggiator
	with random note generation, harmonic controls, input pitch and velocity tracking, as well
	as automatic modulation of various parameters. Raptor has many more parameters than the
	other two plugins and is thus more difficult to use, but can also produce much more varied
	output.
    </p>

      <h2>Improvements and Bug Fixes</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>Disable translation by default on Windows &amp;

	  <li>Clips velocity sensitivity control now operational for external MIDI hardware used to launch.</li>
	  <li>Allow playhead to be optionally included as a snap target.</li>
	  <li>Fix long-standing subtle issues with the JACK audio/MIDI backend.</li>
	  <li>Fixed bug where undo operation could delete plugins.</li>
	  <li>Fix build script to work with Python 3.12.</li>
	</ul>
      <h3>MIDI Related</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li>Fix playback of MIDI notes which start at current playhead position.</li>
	  <li>Fix potential loss of MIDI playback caused by automation and transport events.</li>
	  <li>Quantization swing fixed.</li>
	  <li>Swing amount now varies from 0 (no swing) through 100
	  (triplet swing), 150 (hard swing), 200 (sextuplet swing) to 300 (maximum swing).</li>
	  <li>Set length of "percussive mode" drawn MIDI notes to 1 tick, which prevents any accidental overlap.</li>
	  <li>Fix MIDI SMF track splitting (which could previously result in a corrupt session).</li>
	  <li>Recording from MIDI track header piano roll now works.</li>
	</ul>
      <h3>Plugin Related</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li>Add ACE Stereo Routing plugin.</li>
	  <li>VST3: work around crash in UAD plugins when using mono configurations.</li>
	  <li>Reduce the number of plugin-related calls to TempoMap::get_grid().</li>
	  <li>Lua processors can now come with factory presets.</li>
	  <li>Fix sample rate of plugins when loading a 2nd (or 3rd...) session.</li>
	  <li>Correctly compute tempo passed to LV2 plugins.</li>
	</ul>
	
      <h3>Control Surfaces and Devices</h3>

	  <li>MIDNAM file for Kurzweil SP4.</li>
	</ul>

      <h2>Removals</h2>
      <p>
	There comes a point in all long-lived software where the best
	thing for users and developers is the removal of certain
	functionality that was either ill-conceived or poorly
	implemented. Ardour 8.0 is no different, and features these removals:
      </p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Remove option to hide or deactivate tempo map
	  markers. The potential for confusion or even madness from
	  this option became clear, and we opted for sanity.</li>
	  <li><p>Remove option to "glue to bars &amp; beats".</p><p> For
	    the time being, MIDI regions and data always use musical time
	    (bars, beats) for their position and length. Audio tracks and
	    regions use audio time (samples) for their position and
	      length.</p><p> Location markers and named ranges use the <em>session
	      default time domain</em> (music or audio) and will follow that setting if you
	    change it.</p></li>
	  <li>Remove the  essentially useless "Audition tool". Use the
	    audition action instead (bound to "a"), which also handles
	    multiple selected regions properly).</li>
	  <li>Remove attempt at scrub-dragging (sort of like a tape
	  machine). This never worked well, and just isn't relevant to
	    a generation raised without much exposure to "rockin' the
	    reels"</li>
	</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="content:encoded"><p><b>OAKLAND&nbsp;</b>— California Attorney General Rob Bonta today issued a statement in response to Senate Bill 478 (SB 478), a bill that&nbsp;he&nbsp;<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-senator-dodd-senator-skinner-introduce-bill-prohibiting" target="_blank">sponsored</a>,&nbsp;being signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom. Coauthored by Senator Bill Dodd (D-Napa) and Senator Nancy Skinner (D-Berkeley), the legislation will prohibit hidden fees (also called ‘junk fees’) in California beginning on July 1, 2024. Hidden fees are fees in which a seller uses an artificially low headline price to attract a customer and usually either discloses additional required fees in smaller print, or reveals additional unavoidable charges later in the buying process.</p>
<p>“Today, California is eliminating hidden fees,”&nbsp;<b>said Attorney General Rob Bonta</b>. “These deceptive fees prevent us from knowing how much we will be charged at the outset.&nbsp;They&nbsp;are bad for consumers and bad for competition. They cost Americans tens of billions of dollars each year. They hit families who are just trying to make ends meet the hardest. And, because a growing list of websites, apps, and brick-and-mortar businesses are using them, they penalize companies that are upfront and transparent with their prices. With the signing of SB 478, California now has the most effective piece of legislation in the nation to tackle this problem. The price Californians see will be the price they pay. I am deeply grateful to Senators Dodd and Skinner, the authors of SB 478, for their commitment to protecting consumers.”</p>
<p>“With the governor’s signing of this historic bill, we can finally take aim at dishonest junk fees that are tacked onto seemingly everything – from online concert tickets to hotel reservations,”&nbsp;<b>said Senator&nbsp;Bill Dodd</b>. “Now we can put the consumer first and create a level playing field for those businesses that advertise the real price, up front. I appreciate everyone who worked to end these dishonest charges that boost corporate profits at the expense of those who can least afford it.”</p>
<p>“California sent a clear message today: The days of bait-and-switch pricing practices are over,”&nbsp;<b>said Senator&nbsp;Nancy Skinner</b>. “With Gov. Newsom’s signing of SB 478, Californians will know up front how much they’re being asked to pay, and no longer be surprised by hidden junk fees when buying a concert or sports ticket or booking hotel rooms for their family vacation.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>After announcing that he was sponsoring SB 478 in February 2023, Attorney General Bonta&nbsp;<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-california-heeding-president-biden%E2%80%99s-call-end-hidden-fees" target="_blank">urged</a>&nbsp;the California Legislature to approve the legislation in March 2023, heeding the call from the Biden-Harris Administration and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for states to better address the nationwide concern of hidden fees. In May 2023, he&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB3vvw2sbF0" target="_blank">held a press conference</a>&nbsp;in San Diego to highlight the bill’s importance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deceptive price advertising&nbsp;is a significant problem facing consumers that appears to be proliferating in more and more sectors of the economy.&nbsp;Hidden&nbsp;required fees are&nbsp;now charged for a variety of goods and services, such as lodging, tickets for live events, and&nbsp;restaurants and food delivery.&nbsp;These fees, when mandatory, are&nbsp;a deceptive way of hiding the true price of a good or service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The text of the legislation is available&nbsp;<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB478" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the thought of handwriting code seems silly, it might surprise you to know that it’s inevitable. If you’re unsure, think about the last job interview you did, and remember how there was no computer around in the interview room — just your interviewers, a blank sheet of paper, and a blue ball-point pen.</p>



<p>For the students among you, it’s even a bigger deal as your grades hang in by the lines of code you had strategically squeezed into the available space in your answer sheet.</p>



<p>And not just that, experienced programmers can point you to the bundle of A4 sheets they had removed from the office copy machine to scribble down a particularly complex algorithm they had been working on.</p>



<p>So whether you’re an exam student, potential job interviewee, or someone wanting to resolve their programming dead ends, I hope this article helps you out when you put your pen to the paper to code.</p>



<p>Although I will focus on the analog aspect of writing code, you can apply these steps to coding in any form or language. So consider this to be also like a generic coding guideline that works specifically for me but can also be very useful to you in your work.</p>


<h3 id="why-write-it-down">Why write it down?</h3>


<p>Before we start, it’s essential to understand that no one expects you to jot down production-ready code in a notebook. It’s not like you can drop that into a code editor and compile it without an error. If producing perfect code was the goal, you would be seated in front of a computer in the interview rooms and exam halls.</p>



<p>The purpose of handwriting code is to work through logic in advance. There’s s desire to “get in the browser” as soon as possible in design, but there is conventional wisdom in sketching designs by hand. A low-fidelity medium encourages quick experimentation and inexpensive mistakes.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="2560" height="2560" src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/preethi-notes-2-scaled.jpg?resize=2560%2C2560&amp;ssl=1" alt="White lined paper with cursive handwritten notes on using :nth-child." srcset="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/preethi-notes-2-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;ssl=1 2560w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/preethi-notes-2-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/preethi-notes-2-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/preethi-notes-2-scaled.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/preethi-notes-2-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/preethi-notes-2-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/preethi-notes-2-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>The toil of trying to figure out how to affect surrounding items with one click (from my <a href="https://css-tricks.com/conditionally-styling-selected-elements-in-a-grid-container/">last article</a>)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The same can be true of code, mainly when working out syntax and semantics. That said, getting the correct syntax and semantics is <em>always</em> a plus point, though not the sole focus of the whole handwriting exercise.</p>



<p>Let’s see where we can start when it comes to handwriting code.</p>


<h3 id="know-your-question">Know your question</h3>


<p>During my final year in college, I couldn’t do an internship or even attend campus interviews because of health reasons. As a result, my very first job interview was quite literal with high stakes.</p>



<p>When I look back now, the interview was pretty easy. But having never attended one before, I was anxious beyond reason. The first thing the interviewers asked about programming was if I could output an inverted triangle made of asterisks. As I said, it was easy — nothing a <code>for</code> loop can’t handle, right? But like I said, my anxiety was through the roof as well.</p>



<p>I took a deep breath, pressed my palm against the blank sheet of paper they had laid out for me, slid it as slow as possible towards me on the table (buying time, of course), clicked the pen, and then I did something right.</p>



<p>I first drew an inverted triangle made of asterisks. That’s how I found my feet on the ground to start answering their question.</p>



<p>I’ve seen otherwise brilliant developers get something wrong simply because they never fully grasp what it is they are solving.</p>



<p>The questions we work with are not like the questions physicists or mathematicians solve. They get a set of parameters and find the missing ones; our questions are also our results. We are already told what our results are —  we have to figure out how to reach them. That’s why it’s imperative to know the question well because you’ll see the result.</p>



<p>Writing down or drawing out what you want to output is one of the best ways to start your coding. I understand that in our fast-paced industry, the expectation is that we have to jump right into the programming by running a “hello world” demo. And that’s great to familiarize yourself with an unfamiliar syntax and shake off your anxiousness about trying something new.</p>



<p>But when someone asks you a question and gives you a result to work up to, wouldn’t it just be better to put that down first? That question/result is not only your starting point but also your point of reference. At any step in your coding, you can look at it to ensure you’re working towards it and that you’re on the right track.</p>



<p>So whether in your answer sheets or in that blank A4 paper you’re about to write in, start by taking a second and writing down what it is you’re trying to output. You can put it in the margins or a corner if you don’t want it to be a part of your answer. Just make sure it’s somewhere where you can keep referencing it.</p>


<h3 id="outline-your-code">Outline your code</h3>


<p>This step is like a double-edged sword. It can get you a roadmap to your program or waste your time. My job is to make sure it’s the former.</p>



<p>So, first and foremost, I like to say: <strong>outlining code is unnecessary if the scope of your problem or question is small.</strong> Again, this practice is neither prescriptive nor universal to all projects or situations. Imagine I’m your interviewer, and I ask you to write how to center an element in a web page using CSS in as many ways as possible. You won’t exactly be needing an outline for this. The code snippets are relatively small for each method.</p>



<p>But now, let’s say I assign you to write a web application that captures user signatures via a touchscreen interface and then saves the signature on the server. Not so straightforward, right? You’ve more than one thing to figure out. Perhaps, a little outline can help.</p>



<ol><li>UI for capturing signature — HTML Canvas? WebGL?</li><li>Disable pointer events on the rest of the web page when the user is signing</li><li>Convert and save the captured image to a PNG file — JS</li><li>Then convert it to blob (maybe) and save it to the visitor’s log data table.</li></ol>



<p>I’ve written a rough sequence of actions I think I might have to code. It could’ve been shorter or longer, depending on what I wanted from it.</p>



<p>I highly recommend outlining code for client projects. Write the outline along with your user requirements or on the back of wireframes you’ve printed out.</p>



<p>Your quick snapshot of bullet points gives you a map, a to-do list, and a checklist to verify against when you reach the end of the project — pretty much your whole project’s summary in a low-fidelity list. It can also become a template to start your next similar project.</p>



<p>But like I said before, this step is like a double-edged sword. You’ll have to keep this short for examinees and interviewees when there are time constraints.</p>



<p>If you don’t know where to start, write down just three essential functions you’ll have to code in your application, and if you have got the time, make it five.</p>



<p>But that’s about it. Spend as little time as possible on this, and don’t sweat over the details. The outline is not going to score you extra points. It’s there only to help you make sure you have everything covered. It captures your initial gut reaction and keeps you honest throughout the project’s life.</p>


<h3 id="longhand-vs-shorthand">Longhand vs. shorthand</h3>


<figure><img decoding="async" width="2560" height="2560" src="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/preethi-notes-1-scaled.jpg?resize=2560%2C2560&amp;ssl=1" alt="White lined paper with cursive handwritten notes in black ink." srcset="https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/preethi-notes-1-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;ssl=1 2560w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/preethi-notes-1-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/preethi-notes-1-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/preethi-notes-1-scaled.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/preethi-notes-1-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/preethi-notes-1-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/preethi-notes-1-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>A quick reference to disable text selection</figcaption></figure>



<p>Time to start coding. So, what do you write? “Bdrs” or “<code>border-radius</code>“; “<code>div -&gt; p</code>” or “<code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code>“; “<code>pl()</code>” or “<code>println()</code>“; “<code>q()</code>” or “<code>querySelector()</code>“?</p>



<p>If someone else is grading your code, then there’s no choice. Leave out abbreviations, pseudo-codes, Emmet shortcuts, and any other form of shorthand writing. Otherwise, there’s no reason to assume that anyone reading this knows what your abbreviations mean.</p>



<p>It’s really up to you.</p>



<p>If you’ve gotten out of touch with writing by hand — and many of us have — it’s better not to go overboard with the longhand notations, as they get tedious. At the same time, there’s no such thing as being too frugal with your writing. Not if you want to be able to look back on it one day and understand what you’d written down.</p>



<p>I have an open file in my note-taking app and a lined notepad on my desk where I write down code snippets I want to save for later reference. They are unorganized, just a long stream of snippets. That’s why when I browse through older notes, I wouldn’t know what I meant to write if I had not written them down clearly.</p>



<p>I forget syntaxes all the time. For instance, I’ve been using the arrow notation for JavaScript functions since it was introduced (because it’s shorter), and I’m pretty sure if someone suddenly asks me to define a function using the <code>function</code> keyword, I might even misplace the parentheses or the function name, inciting a syntax error.</p>



<p>It’s not unusual for us to forget syntaxes we haven’t used in a while. That’s why it’s better to write your notes clearly when you know you need them for future reference.</p>


<h3 id="the-nonsequential-flow-of-code">The non-sequential flow of code</h3>


<p>Unlike the last step, which doesn’t apply to those of you interviewees and test-takers, this one is catered especially to you.</p>



<p>Most programming languages are interpreted, compiled, and executed so that sometimes pre-written code in the source is executed later when called. We do it in JavaScript, for example, with function calling — functions can be defined initially, then executed later. Examinees and interviewees can use this to start working on the critical point of your answer first.</p>



<p>As I’ve said from the very beginning, the purpose of handwriting code is to work through or test the logic of whatever it is you program. It’s best when you focus on resolving that first.</p>



<p>Let’s take a classic textbook example — a program to find the nth <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number" rel="noopener">Fibonacci number</a>. If I were to write a simple outline for it, it would be something like this:</p>



<ol><li>Get the input.</li><li>Calculate the Fibonacci number.</li><li>Summarise the output.</li><li>Print the output.</li></ol>



<p>All the steps in that outline are essential; however, 1, 3, and 4 are more obligatory. They are necessary but not important enough to focus on right away.</p>



<p>It’s better to start writing down the code to calculate the Fibonacci number rather than to fetch the input. Wrap it in a function, then go ahead and write the code sequentially and write down a line to call that function where appropriate.</p>



<p>Spend your time writing code that focuses on the heart of the problem.</p>



<p>Real professionals can skip ahead. Let’s say I have a client project, and I have to work with some triangle geometry — got two sides, opposite angle, and gotta find the third side’s length. And I’ve decided to scribble on paper to get started rather than opening my <abbr title="integrated development environment">IDE</abbr>.</p>



<p>First, I would draw the triangle, of course (that’s something I’m very experienced with, as you can tell). I would write down some sample lengths and angles. Then I’d write the formula (compliments of online searching, for sure), and then I’d jump right to the code for the function.</p>



<p>There’s no point in me writing down the obligatory steps even though I’ll need them in production-ready code. But it would be different if I had to write that on an answer sheet in an exam. I can’t skip the other steps; however, I can still start with the code for the formula.</p>


<h3 id="pseudocode">Pseudo-code</h3>


<p>Chris has already written a <a href="https://css-tricks.com/pseudo-code/">handy article on pseudo-code</a> that I highly recommend you give a solid read.</p>



<p>For all those professionals who feel like the whole handwriting code thing doesn’t seem like your cup of tea but still might be curious if it can help you, then <strong>pseudo-code</strong> might be the balance you’re looking for.</p>



<p>It’s similar to outlining the code, as I mentioned in one of the previous steps. However, it’s briefer and feels more like shorthand coding. It’s sometimes also referred to as “skeleton code.”</p>



<p>Here’s some quick pseudo-code for a CSS grid layout:</p>



<pre rel="" data-line=""><code markup="tt">Grid
5 60px rows
6 100px columns</code></pre>



<p>There isn’t much to write! So, even though putting a pencil to paper is excellent for this sort of thing, it’s just as effective, fast, and inexpensive to jot some pseudo code into whatever program you’re using.</p>


<h3 id="space-and-comments">Space and comments</h3>


<p>I believe code is 90% keywords and 10% tabs. Withoutspacesthereadabilityofwordsdecreases. Indentations are necessary for handwritten code as well. However, please don’t use it for every level because the width of the paper will limit you. Use spaces judiciously, but use them.</p>

<p>If you’re writing code for your use, I also believe that if you’ve followed everything I’ve mentioned so far and have already written down your output and an outline on the page, you may not even need to include comments. Comments tell you quickly what its following set of code does. If you have already written and read an outline for the code, then comments are redundant notes.</p>



<p>However, if your judgment says to put down one, then do it. Add it to the right side of the code (since you won’t be able to insert it between already written lines the way you could in, say, VS Code). Use forward slashes, brackets, or arrows to denote that they are comments.</p>



<p>For examinees who are unconfident with a certain syntax, write down comments. This way, at least, you’re letting the person grading your paper know your intention with that incorrectly formatted code. And use only the correct delimiters to denote comments — for example, that would be the forward slashes for JavaScript.</p>


<h3 id="analog-vs-digital">Analog vs. digital</h3>


<p>As I mentioned earlier, everything I’m providing here can is generic coding advice. If you don’t want to try this with physical paper, any note-taking application also works.</p>



<p>But if you’re going to try the digital route, my recommendation is to try using something other than a straight note-taking app. Work with more visual digital tools — flow diagrams, mind maps, wireframes, etc. They can help you visualize your result, the outlines, and the code itself.</p>



<p>I am not much of a digital citizen (except for working on the web and recently converting to reading e-books), so I stick to physical notebooks.</p>


<h3 id="my-favorite-tools-for-handwriting-code">My favorite tools for handwriting code</h3>


<p>Any pencil and paper will do! But there are lots of options out there, and these are a few choice tools I use:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Staedtler-Pigment-Liner-0-3mm-308-0-3/dp/B00AHW572W" rel="noopener">Staedtler Pigment Liner 0.3mm</a> (Black)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mitsubishi-Pencil-ballpoint-stream-SXN220007-24/dp/B00O4P5CI2/ref=sr_1_5?crid=SN007BBRD9TB&amp;keywords=Mitsubishi+JETSTREAM+101+0.7&amp;qid=1658334470&amp;s=office-products&amp;sprefix=mitsubishi+jetstream+101+0.7%2Coffice-products%2C99&amp;sr=1-5" rel="noopener">Mitsubishi JETSTREAM 101 0.7mm</a> (Black)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/MUJI-Blank-Notebook-Unruled-30sheets/dp/B00IQQE5EM/ref=sr_1_5?crid=3EQV4ID50LZ56&amp;keywords=MUJI+Notebook+A5&amp;qid=1658334618&amp;s=office-products&amp;sprefix=muji+notebook+a5%2Coffice-products%2C101&amp;sr=1-5" rel="noopener">MUJI Notebook A5 6mm Rule 30 sheets</a> (Lightweight and easy to carry)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/MUJI-Twin-Tip-Highlighter-3-colors-Pack/dp/B0736YVQBC/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3A01WD7YWRCWY&amp;keywords=MUJI+Twin-Tip+Highlighter&amp;qid=1658334679&amp;s=office-products&amp;sprefix=muji+twin-tip+highlighter%2Coffice-products%2C88&amp;sr=1-2" rel="noopener">MUJI Twin-Tip Highlighter Pen</a> (Yellow)</li></ul>


<h3 id="there-is-no-write-way-to-code">There is no “write” way to code</h3>


<p>I hope, if nothing else, my little way of handwriting code with pencil and paper makes you evaluate the way you already plan and write code. I like knowing how other developers approach their work, and this is my way of giving you a peek into the way I do things.</p>



<p>Again, nothing here is scientific or an exact art. But if you want to give handwritten code planning a try, here’s everything we’ve covered in a nice ordered list:</p>



<ol><li>Start by writing down (with sample data, if needed) the output of your code.</li><li>Write an outline for the code. Please keep it to three steps for small projects or ones that are less complex.</li><li>Use longhand notations. Developers writing for themselves can use shorthand notations as long as the writing is legible and makes sense to you when you refer to it later.</li><li>When under a time constraint, consider writing the code that tackles the heart of the problem first. Later, write down a call to that code at the right place in your sequential code.</li><li>If you feel confident, try writing pseudo code addressing the main idea.</li><li>Use proper indentations and spaces — and be mindful of the paper’s width.</li></ol>



<p>That’s it! When you’re ready to try writing code by hand, I hope this article makes it easy for you to start. And if you’re sitting down for an exam or an interview, I hope this helps you focus on getting the questions right.</p>

<p>Flexoki is an inky color scheme for prose and code. Flexoki is designed for reading and writing on digital screens. It is inspired by analog printing inks and warm shades of paper.</p>

<p>Flexoki is minimalistic and high-contrast. The colors are calibrated for legibility and perceptual balance across devices and when switching between light and dark modes.</p>

<p>Flexoki is <a href="https://github.com/kepano/flexoki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open-source</a> under the MIT license. You can try Flexoki with my <a href="https://stephango.com/obsidian">Obsidian</a> theme <a href="https://stephango.com/minimal">Minimal</a>.</p>

<h2 id="color-palette">Color palette</h2>

<p>Flexoki is the color palette used on this site. To switch between light and dark mode press the <strong>D</strong> key or use the toggle at the top of the page. Click the swatches to copy a color to your clipboard.</p>







<h2 id="base-tones">Base tones</h2>

<p>Flexoki uses warm monochromatic base tones that blend the black ink tone with the base paper tone. 8 colors are used in light and dark mode:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>3 text colors:</strong> normal, muted, faint</li>
  <li>
<strong>3 interface colors:</strong> normal, hover, active</li>
  <li>
<strong>2 background colors:</strong> primary, secondary</li>
</ul>

<p>Incremental values can be derived using opacity. For example, you can use a 60% opacity black tone on top of the paper tone to create the 600 value.</p>

<h2 id="colors">Colors</h2>

<p>8 colors are available for accents and syntax highlighting. Each color is available in two tones calibrated for light and dark modes.</p>

<p>In the future, a full range of tones from 50 to 950 will be added. Unlike the base tones, colors cannot be blended using opacity because this desaturates the pigment effect. More on this topic below.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>I created Flexoki for my personal site, <a href="https://stephango.com/">stephango.com</a>. You’re reading it now. I wanted the colors to feel distinctive yet familiar. Like ink on paper.</p>

<p>The name Flexoki comes from <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexography" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flexography</a></em> — a common printing process for paper and cardboard<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I spent many years working with dyes and inks particularly for my companies <a href="https://stephango.com/inkodye">Inkodye</a> and <a href="https://stephango.com/lumi">Lumi</a>. I also have a fascination with <a href="https://stephango.com/the-elusiveness-of-digital-paper">digital paper</a>. I wanted to bring the comfort of analog color to emissive digital screens.</p>

<p>One challenge is that ink on paper is a subtractive process whereas LCD and OLED screens use additive color. Replicating the effect of mixing pigments digitally is difficult. The following video illustrates the problem:</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6JVjHqas60Q" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><small>See the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qa5iWdfNKg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full SIGGRAPH 2021 talk</a></small></p>

<p>Mixing blue and yellow paint creates green, whereas digital color mixing results in a brownish hue. Watercolors retain their saturation when you dilute them, whereas reducing the opacity of digital colors makes them look desaturated.</p>

<p>Another challenge with digital color is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_color_spaces_and_their_uses" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">human perception</a> across color spaces. For example, yellow appears much brighter than blue. Ethan Schoonover’s color scheme <a href="https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solarized</a> (2011) was an important inspiration for Flexoki. His emphasis on CIELAB lightness relationships helped me understand how to find colors that appear cohesive.</p>

<p>I found that choosing colors with perfect perceptual consistency can be at odds with the distinctiveness of colors in practical applications like syntax highlighting. If you adhere too closely to evenness in perceptual lightness you can end up with a palette that looks washed out and difficult to parse.</p>

<p>Solving for all these problems is how I arrived at Flexoki. I wish it could have been more science than art, but it wasn’t. Some day I hope to arrive at a more reliable way to generate digital color palettes that respect the constraints I laid out. In the meantime, I hope you find this iteration of Flexoki useful.</p>

href="https://www.theverge.com/23725039/framework-laptop-13-2023-intel-review">modular repairable laptops</a> — first, it sent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/19/23312697/lenovo-framework-laptop-power-button-trademark-infringement">a cease-and-desist over a Framework power button</a>, then it unveiled its own modular concept laptop dubbed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/17/23797765/lenovo-ponders-repairable-laptops-with-project-aurora">Project Aurora</a> with no promise to actually build such a thing.</p></div><p>But it looks like the ThinkPad and Motorola owner might actually be serious about ramping up repairability. “More than 80 percent of our devices will be able to be repaired at the customer,” Lenovo executive Luca Rossi told the Canalys EMEA Forum 2023, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/05/lenovo_pc_boss_4_in/">according to <em>The Register</em></a>.</p><p>“Batteries, SSD, many things will not any longer be sealed into the product but will be available for the customer to be to repaired on site and then save a lot of waste,” he reportedly said. </p><p>Lenovo is just one of many companies that have suddenly increased their efforts on repairability and sustainability, and it isn’t coming out of the goodness of companies’ hearts — the economic and political climate has swiftly changed. </p><div><p>Apple went from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525542/apple-right-to-repair-bill-california-lobbyist-comptia">vehemently and sneakily lobbying against right-to-repair bills</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23843506/apple-california-right-to-repair-sb-244">suddenly supporting those efforts</a>. Prominent right-to-repair advocates <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23017361/ifixit-right-to-repair-parts-google-samsung-valve-microsoft">told me in 2022</a> that Samsung and Google were convinced when they saw a shift in consumer behavior combined with the imminent threat of legislation. </p></div><div><p>In 2023, it’s no longer just a threat. The European Union has recently shown that it has the power to force companies to change their products — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/7/23156361/european-union-usb-c-wired-charging-iphone-lightning-ewaste">it’s the reason</a> we now have a USB-C port on the iPhone 15. Next, it may force <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/24/23771064/european-union-battery-regulation-ecodesign-user-replacable-batteries">smartphone manufacturers to make their batteries easier to replace</a>. Wouldn’t that be interesting? </p></div></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23899461/discogs-sellers-vinyl-cds-community-fees"><h2>Discogs’ vibrant vinyl community is shattering</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/7/23907776/mgm-refused-pay-customer-data-stolen-cyberattack-ransom"><h2>MGM didn’t pay up after hackers broke into its system and stole customer data</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23906072/apple-ios-17-iphone-messages-how-to"><h2>How to use the new Messages features in iOS 17</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23903842/pixel-8-pro-temperature-sensor-fda-feature"><h2>What’s up with the temperature sensor on the Pixel 8 Pro?</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23906577/ai-gadgets-humane-pin-pixel-8-asassins-creed-spotify-microsoft-installer"><h2>The AI gadgets are coming</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Sleep is important. People vastly underestimate the extent to which not sleeping is harmful, viewing it as a valid trade off for productivity and overlooking all of the longterm negative effects.</p>
<h2 id="said-effects-being">Said Effects Being</h2>
<ul>
<li>Metabolism slows down, appetite goes up</li>
<li>Depression, anxiety, irritability, distress</li>
<li>Increased risk of diabetes</li>
<li>More substance abuse/addiction (alcohol and caffiene, specifically) [ironically both depressants and stimulents]</li>
<li>Lower life expectancy</li>
<li>Lower cognitive performance (specifically in reasoning/logic)</li>
<li>Long and short term memory issues</li>
<li>Increased (+33%) risk of dementia which is something you should be terrified of</li>
<li>Fatigued and demotivated</li>
<li>Lower libido</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impact-of-those-being">Impact of Those Being</h2>
<ul>
<li>You get fat</li>
<li>You might enter a state where consumption of sugar has to be stringently regulated and have to do annoying blood checks which is expensive if you’re in country with a questionable private healthcare system</li>
<li>No one likes talking to you or being around you in general because you become asshole-ish and/or a loner</li>
<li>You have to deal with expensive and unhealthy addictions</li>
<li>More likely to die early!</li>
<li>more stupid - can’t unlock your full intelligence and cognitive prowess, so you’re stifling potential</li>
<li>Memory also worsens, see above</li>
<li>Ooh that decreased cognitive state has a higher chance of being permanent and getting much much worse, making your life miserable</li>
<li>You lose all ambition so start following others. you also feel dead inside all the time and just want to sleeeep</li>
<li>to top it all off</li>
<li>can’t sexually pleasure your parter to their level of desire, leading to strained relations (even more strained, since the aforementioned negative effects on personality likely contribute as well) so they are less useful in helping you deal with all of the above issues.</li>

  </p>

  <p>This has been a ground-breaking year for my C skills, and paradigm shifts
in my technique has provoked me to reconsider my habits and coding style.
It’s been my largest personal style change in years, so I’ve decided to
take a snapshot of its current state and my reasoning. These changes have
produced significant productive and organizational benefits, so while most
is certainly subjective, it likely includes a few objective improvements.
I’m not saying everyone should write C this way, and when I contribute
code to a project I follow their local style. This is about what works
well for me.</p>

<h3 id="primitive-types">Primitive types</h3>

<p>Starting with the fundamentals, I’ve been using short names for primitive
types. The resulting clarity was more than I had expected, and it’s made
my code more enjoyable to review. These names appear frequently throughout
a program, so conciseness pays. Also, now that I’ve gone without, <code>_t</code>
suffixes are more visually distracting than I had realized.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>uint8_t</span>   <span>u8</span><span>;</span>
<span>typedef</span> <span>char16_t</span>  <span>c16</span><span>;</span>

<span>typedef</span> <span>size_t</span>    <span>usize</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Some people prefer an <code>s</code> prefix for signed types. I prefer <code>i</code>, plus as
you’ll see, I have other designs for <code>s</code>. For sizes, <code>isize</code> would be more
consistent, and wouldn’t hog the identifier, but <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2023/09/27/">signed sizes are the
way</a> and so I want them in a place of privilege. <code>usize</code> is niche,
mainly for interacting with external interfaces where it might matter.</p>

<p><code>b32</code> is a “32-bit boolean” and communicates intent. I could use <code>_Bool</code>,
but I’d rather stick to a natural word size and stay away from its weird
semantics. To beginners it might seem like “wasting memory” by using a
32-bit boolean, but in practice that’s never the case. It’s either in a
register (return value, local variable) or would be padded anyway (struct
field). When it actually matters, I pack booleans into a <code>flags</code> variable,
and a 1-byte boolean rarely important.</p>

<p>While UTF-16 might seem niche, it’s a necessary evil when dealing with
Win32, so <code>c16</code> (“16-bit character”) has made a frequent appearance. I
could have based it on <code>uint16_t</code>, but putting the name <code>char16_t</code> in its
“type hierarchy” communicates to debuggers, particularly GDB, that for
display purposes these variables hold character data. Officially Win32
uses a type named <code>wchar_t</code>, but I like being explicit about UTF-16.</p>

<p><code>u8</code> is for octets, usually UTF-8 data. It’s distinct from <code>byte</code>, which
represents raw memory and is a special <em>aliasing</em> type. In theory these
can be distinct types with differing semantics, though I’m not aware of
any implementation that does so (yet?). For now it’s about intent.</p>

<p>What about systems that don’t support fixed width types? That’s academic,
and far too much time has been wasted worrying about it. That includes
time wasted on typing out <code>int_fast32_t</code> and similar nonsense. Virtually
no existing software would actually work correctly on such systems — I’m
certain nobody’s <em>testing</em> it after all — so it seems nobody else cares
either.</p>

<p>I don’t intend to use these names in isolation, such as in code snippets
(outside of this article). If I did, examples would require the <code>typedefs</code>
to give readers the complete context. That’s not worth extra explanation.
Even in the most recent articles I’ve used <code>ptrdiff_t</code> instead of <code>size</code>.</p>

<h3 id="macros">Macros</h3>

<p>Next, my “standard” set of macros:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>#define sizeof(x)    (size)sizeof(x)
#define alignof(x)   (size)_Alignof(x)
#define countof(a)   (sizeof(a) / sizeof(*(a)))
#define lengthof(s)  (countof(s) - 1)
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>While I still prefer <code>ALL_CAPS</code> for constants, I’ve adopted lowercase for
function-like macros because it’s nicer to read. They don’t have the same
namespace problems as other macro definitions: I can have a macro named
<code>new()</code> and also variables and fields named <code>new</code> because they don’t look
like function calls.</p>

<p>For GCC and Clang, my favorite <code>assert</code> macro now looks like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>#define assert(c)  while (!(c)) __builtin_unreachable()
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>It has useful properties beyond <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2022/06/26/">the usual benefits</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It does not require separate definitions for debug and release builds.
Instead it’s controlled by the presence of Undefined Behavior Sanitizer
(UBSan), which is already present/absent in these circumstances. That
includes <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2019/01/25/">fuzz testing</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>libubsan</code> provides a diagnostic printout with a file and line number.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In release builds it turns into a practical optimization hint.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To enable assertions in release builds, put UBSan in trap mode with
<code>-fsanitize-trap</code> and then enable at least <code>-fsanitize=unreachable</code>. In
theory this can also be done with <code>-funreachable-traps</code>, but as of this
writing it’s been broken for the past few GCC releases.</p>

<h3 id="parameters-and-functions">Parameters and functions</h3>

<p>No <code>const</code>. It serves no practical role in optimization, and <strong>I cannot
recall an instance where it caught, or would have caught, a mistake</strong>. I
held out for awhile as prototype documentation, but on reflection I found
that good parameter names were sufficient. Dropping <code>const</code> has made me
noticeably more productive by reducing cognitive load and eliminating
visual clutter. I now believe its inclusion in C was a costly mistake.</p>

<p>(One small exception: I still like it as a hint to place static tables in
read-only memory closer to the code. I’ll cast away the <code>const</code> if needed.
This is only of minor importance.)</p>

<p>Literal <code>0</code> for null pointers. Short and sweet. This is not new, but a
style I’ve used for about 7 years now, and has appeared all over my
writing since. There are some theoretical edge cases where it may cause
defects, and lots of <a href="https://ljabl.com/nullptr.xhtml">ink has been spilled</a> on the subject, but
after a couple 100K lines of code I’ve yet to see it happen.</p>

<p><code>restrict</code> when necessary, but better to organize code so that it’s not,
e.g. don’t write to “out” parameters in loops, or don’t use out parameters
at all (more on that momentarily). I don’t bother with <code>inline</code> because I
compile everything as one translation unit anyway.</p>

<p><code>typedef</code> all structures. I used to shy away from it, but eliminating the
<code>struct</code> keyword makes code easier to read. If it’s a recursive structure,
use a forward declaration immediately above so that such fields can use
the short name:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>map</span> <span>map</span><span>;</span>
<span>struct</span> <span>map</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>map</span> <span>*</span><span>child</span><span>[</span><span>4</span><span>];</span>
    <span>// ...</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Declare all functions <code>static</code> except for entry points. Again, with
everything compiled as a single translation unit there’s no reason to do
otherwise. It was probably a mistake for C not to default to <code>static</code>,
though I don’t have a strong opinion on the matter. With the clutter
eliminated through short types, no <code>const</code>, no <code>struct</code>, etc. <strong>functions
fit comfortably on the same line as their return type</strong>. I used to break
them apart so that the function name began on its own line, but that’s no
longer necessary.</p>

<p>In my writing I sometimes omit <code>static</code> to simplify, and because outside
the context of a complete program it’s mostly irrelevant. However, I will
use it below to emphasize this style.</p>

<p>For awhile I capitalized type names as that effectively put them in a kind
of namespace apart from variables and functions, but I eventually stopped.
I may try this idea in different way in the future.</p>

<h3 id="strings">Strings</h3>

<p>One of my most productive changes this year has been the total rejection
of null terminated strings — another of those terrible mistakes — and the
embrace of <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2023/01/18/#implementation-highlights">this basic string type</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>#define s8(s) (s8){(u8 *)s, lengthof(s)}
</span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>u8</span>  <span>*</span><span>data</span><span>;</span>
    <span>size</span> <span>len</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>s8</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I’ve used a few names for it, but this is my favorite. The <code>s</code> is for
string, and the <code>8</code> is for UTF-8 or <code>u8</code>. The <code>s8</code> macro (sometimes just
spelled <code>S</code>) wraps a C string literal, making a <code>s8</code> string out of it. A
<code>s8</code> is handled like a <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2019/06/30/">fat pointer</a>, passed and returned by copy.
<code>s8</code> makes for a great function prefix, unlike <code>str</code>, all of which are
reserved. Some examples:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>s8</span>   <span>s8span</span><span>(</span><span>u8</span> <span>*</span><span>,</span> <span>u8</span> <span>*</span><span>);</span>
<span>static</span> <span>b32</span>  <span>s8equals</span><span>(</span><span>s8</span><span>,</span> <span>s8</span><span>);</span>
<span>static</span> <span>size</span> <span>s8compare</span><span>(</span><span>s8</span><span>,</span> <span>s8</span><span>);</span>
<span>static</span> <span>u64</span>  <span>s8hash</span><span>(</span><span>s8</span><span>);</span>
<span>static</span> <span>s8</span>   <span>s8trim</span><span>(</span><span>s8</span><span>);</span>
<span>static</span> <span>s8</span>   <span>s8clone</span><span>(</span><span>s8</span><span>,</span> <span>arena</span> <span>*</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then when combined with the macro:</p>

<div><pre><code>    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>s8equals</span><span>(</span><span>tagname</span><span>,</span> <span>s8</span><span>(</span><span>"body"</span><span>)))</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// ...</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>You might be tempted to use a flexible array member to pack the size and
array together as one allocation. Tried it. Its inflexibility is totally
not worth whatever benefits it might have. Consider, for instance, how
you’d create such a string out of a literal, and how it would be used.</p>

<p>A few times I’ve thought, “This program is simple enough that I don’t need
a string type for this data.” That thought is nearly always wrong. Having
it available helps me think more clearly, and makes for simpler programs.
(C++ got it only a few years ago with <code>std::string_view</code> and <code>std::span</code>.)</p>

<p>It has a natural UTF-16 counterpart, <code>s16</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>#define s16(s) (s16){u##s, lengthof(u##s)}
</span><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>c16</span> <span>*</span><span>data</span><span>;</span>
    <span>size</span> <span>len</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>s16</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I’m not entirely sold on gluing <code>u</code> to the literal in the macro, versus
writing it out on the string literal.</p>

<h3 id="more-structures">More structures</h3>

<p>Another change has been preferring structure returns instead of out
parameters. It’s effectively a multiple value return, though without
destructuring. A great organizational change. For example, this function
returns two values, a parse result and a status:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>i32</span> <span>value</span><span>;</span>
    <span>b32</span> <span>ok</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>i32parsed</span><span>;</span>

<span>static</span> <span>i32parsed</span> <span>i32parse</span><span>(</span><span>s8</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Worried about the “extra copying?” Have no fear, because in practice
calling conventions turn this into a hidden, <code>restrict</code>-qualified out
parameter — if it’s not inlined such that any return value overhead would
be irrelevant anyway. With this return style I’m less tempted to use
in-band signals like special null returns to indicate errors, which is
less clear.</p>

<p>It’s also led to a style of defining a zero-initialized return value at
the top of the function, i.e. <code>ok</code> is false, and then use it for all
<code>return</code> statements. On error, it can bail out with an immediate return.
The success path sets <code>ok</code> to true before the return.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>i32parsed</span> <span>i32parse</span><span>(</span><span>s8</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>i32parsed</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>0</span><span>};</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>size</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>len</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>u8</span> <span>digit</span> <span>=</span> <span>s</span><span>.</span><span>data</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>-</span> <span>'0'</span><span>;</span>
        <span>// ...</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>overflow</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>return</span> <span>r</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span>
        <span>r</span><span>.</span><span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>r</span><span>.</span><span>value</span><span>*</span><span>10</span> <span>+</span> <span>digit</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>r</span><span>.</span><span>ok</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>r</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Aside from static data, I’ve also moved away from initializers except the
conventional zero initializer. (Notable exception: <code>s8</code> and <code>s16</code> macros.)
This includes designated initializers. Instead I’ve been initializing with
assignments. For example, this <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2023/02/13/">buffered output</a> “constructor”:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>u8</span> <span>*</span><span>buf</span><span>;</span>
    <span>i32</span> <span>len</span><span>;</span>
    <span>i32</span> <span>cap</span><span>;</span>
    <span>i32</span> <span>fd</span><span>;</span>
    <span>b32</span> <span>err</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>u8buf</span><span>;</span>

<span>static</span> <span>u8buf</span> <span>newu8buf</span><span>(</span><span>arena</span> <span>*</span><span>perm</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>cap</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span> <span>fd</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>u8buf</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>0</span><span>};</span>
    <span>r</span><span>.</span><span>buf</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span><span>(</span><span>perm</span><span>,</span> <span>u8</span><span>,</span> <span>cap</span><span>);</span>
    <span>r</span><span>.</span><span>cap</span> <span>=</span> <span>cap</span><span>;</span>
    <span>r</span><span>.</span><span>fd</span>  <span>=</span> <span>fd</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>r</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I like how this reads, but it also eliminates a cognitive burden: The
assignments are separated by sequence points, giving them an explicit
order. It doesn’t matter here, but in other cases it does:</p>

<div><pre><code>    <span>example</span> <span>e</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>randname</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>rng</span><span>),</span>
        <span>.</span><span>age</span>  <span>=</span> <span>randage</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>rng</span><span>),</span>
        <span>.</span><span>seat</span> <span>=</span> <span>randseat</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>rng</span><span>),</span>
    <span>};</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>There are 6 possible values for <code>e</code> from the same seed. I like no longer
thinking about these possibilities.</p>

<h3 id="odds-and-ends">Odds and ends</h3>

<p>Prefer <code>__attribute</code> to <code>__attribute__</code>. The <code>__</code> suffix is excessive and
unnecessary.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>__attribute</span><span>((</span><span>malloc</span><span>,</span> <span>alloc_size</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>)))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>For Win32 systems programming, which typically only requires a modest
number of declarations and definitions, rather than include <code>windows.h</code>,
<a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2023/05/31/">write the prototypes out by hand</a> using custom types. It reduces
build times, declutters namespaces, and interfaces more cleanly with the
program (no more <code>DWORD</code>/<code>BOOL</code>/<code>ULONG_PTR</code>, but <code>u32</code>/<code>b32</code>/<code>uptr</code>).</p>

<div><pre><code><span>#define W32(r) __declspec(dllimport) r __stdcall
</span><span>W32</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span>   <span>ExitProcess</span><span>(</span><span>u32</span><span>);</span>
<span>W32</span><span>(</span><span>i32</span><span>)</span>    <span>GetStdHandle</span><span>(</span><span>u32</span><span>);</span>
<span>W32</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>VirtualAlloc</span><span>(</span><span>byte</span> <span>*</span><span>,</span> <span>usize</span><span>,</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span> <span>u32</span><span>);</span>
<span>W32</span><span>(</span><span>b32</span><span>)</span>    <span>WriteConsoleA</span><span>(</span><span>uptr</span><span>,</span> <span>u8</span> <span>*</span><span>,</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span> <span>u32</span> <span>*</span><span>,</span> <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>);</span>
<span>W32</span><span>(</span><span>b32</span><span>)</span>    <span>WriteConsoleW</span><span>(</span><span>uptr</span><span>,</span> <span>c16</span> <span>*</span><span>,</span> <span>u32</span><span>,</span> <span>u32</span> <span>*</span><span>,</span> <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>For inline assembly, treat the outer parentheses like braces, put a space
before the opening parenthesis, just like <code>if</code>, and start each constraint
line with its colon.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>u64</span> <span>rdtscp</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>u32</span> <span>hi</span><span>,</span> <span>lo</span><span>;</span>
    <span>asm</span> <span>volatile</span> <span>(</span>
        <span>"rdtscp"</span>
        <span>:</span> <span>"=d"</span><span>(</span><span>hi</span><span>),</span> <span>"=a"</span><span>(</span><span>lo</span><span>)</span>
        <span>:</span>
        <span>:</span> <span>"cx"</span><span>,</span> <span>"memory"</span>
    <span>);</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>u64</span><span>)</span><span>hi</span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>32</span> <span>|</span> <span>lo</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>There’s surely a lot more to my style than this, but unlike the above,
those details haven’t changed this year. To see most of the mentioned
items in action in a small program, see <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/scratch/blob/master/misc/wordhist.c"><code>wordhist.c</code></a>, one of my
testing grounds for <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2023/09/30/">hash-tries</a>, or for a slightly larger program,

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>I will demonstrate FPGA-based 64-bit RISC-V computer, capable of booting and
running the riscv64 port of Fedora. Using Free/Libre packages available as
part of the Fedora repositories, this machine is capable of recompiling not
only its own software (e.g., kernel, glibc, gcc), but also its own gateware
(i.e., FPGA bitstream), completely from source code, all the way down to (but
not including) the physical (FPGA) silicon.</p><div><p>Modern hardware development shares many similarities with software: design and
specification in a programmatic hardware description source language (HDL),
and compilation of said sources into either photolitographic masks etched into
silicon for Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), or into
configuration data (bitstream) for a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA).</p>

<p>Hardware vulnerabilities (accidental or intentional) can be inserted during any
such lifecycle stages: as part of the design in HDL sources, during compilation
where buggy or malicious toolchains generate malfunctioning designs from clean
HDL sources, or during ASIC fabrication, where masks are altered to etch
backdoors or Trojans directly into the silicon.</p>

<p>Once fabricated, ASICs are difficult, expensive, and impractical to check for
vulnerabilities, which can be as bad as a privilege escalation backdoor
allowing for a total system compromise, even in the absence of any software
exploits available to the attacker.</p>

<p>Let's begin by mitigating against ASIC fabrication-time backdoor insertion by
using soft-IP-core hardware blocks on FPGAs, which are fabricated in the
absence of any knowledge of the final design details, and also consist of a
regular grid of identical, generic configurable blocks -- making it easier to
inspect for defects.</p>

<p>Having settled on FPGAs for hardware designs requiring enhanced assurance, we
can mitigate against HDL source and toolchain vulnerability insertion by
insisting on openly available sources to both, and on the ability of the system
to be self-hosting, i.e., to rebuild everything, from source, without relying
on assistance from any external "black box" or proprietary components.</p>

<p>I will demonstrate a Fedora capable RISC-V computer based on the Rocket CPU,
using LiteX for the rest of its chipset, deployed on a Lattice ECP5 FPGA board,
with the bitstream generated from sources by a fully Free/Libre toolchain
consisting of Yosys, Trellis, and NextPnR. Most importantly, the computer will
be capable of (slowly) rebuilding its own bitstream, by being capable of
directly executing the Yosys/Trellis/NextPnR toolchain.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>Hacking</h2>
<p>Most MiniDisc aficionados are aware of unit hacking to gain access to new features. The unit that perhaps benefits the most from this is the Sony MZ-N510, which also comes in the <a href="https://www.sharoma.com/minidisc/img/n520_03.jpg">N520</a> and NF610 variants. The 2001 model R700 can be hacked to add many features of its upscale brother, the <a href="https://www.sharoma.com/minidisc/img/r900_01.jpg">R900</a>, as well as the Type-R codec, which renders the R700 capable of performing real-time SP recordings with Sony's last evolution of ATRAC1.</p>
<p>The hacking instructions on this page are colour coded. Commands using buttons on the MD units are displayed in: <span>BLUE</span> and when referring to values on the LCD display of the MD units the colour will be: <span>GREEN</span>. When new values are written to the MD unit's firmware, this will be shown in: <span>RED</span>

<h2 id="n5xx">The N510/20 hack</h2>
<h3>Introduction to the units</h3>
<p>This hack works for the <a href="http://www.minidisc.org/part_Sony_MZ-N510.html">MZ-N510</a>, MZ-N520 and <a href="http://www.minidisc.org/part_Sony_MZ-NF610.html">MZ-NF610</a> units, which are basically the same unit. The N510 is the first model to use this mold, the F610 adds a radio remote and the N520 is a 2004 European version with new software bundled and a rechargeable (700mAh Ni-MH) AA battery. The N510 was introduced in 2003 as a budget (but not quite entry-level) Net-MD recorder. It boasts an excellent design, quiet unit noise (I've owned an R90 and R900 and in comparison it is very quiet), great build quality and a line/optical input. Even some HiMD recorders now lack this very important feature. It means true, high quality, real-time SP recordings can be made from an optical digital source. The unit lacks a microphone input, but does come with a remote port and a non-LCD remote. I use my R900 backlit LCD remote (RM-MC11EL), or my MC38EL, both of which function perfectly. These units were probably the last decent budget Sony models. The North American market got some pretty spartan units in 2003/4 that were just plain inflexible downloaders. My version is a UK N520, 2004 model. The unit feels solid, and like the R700, boasts a wonderfully ergonomic design. Unless I'm mistaken it's the last non-HiMD portable recorder Sony sold, at least in the UK anyway. It was sold until the termination of the 2004 product line, alongside the first generation of HiMD portables.</p>

<h3>Features and specifications</h3>
<p>These models all have the Type-S codec (I have seen early publicity shots of the N10 having Type-R, but my N520 definitely has Type-S and most, if not all, N510 and NF610s do too), which means SP recordings are made with the final version of Sony's original ATRAC1 codec, Type-R, and MDLP playback modes are improved with the Type-S version. Type-S improves <em>playback of MDLP tracks</em> and is not a recording enhancement. The only major drawback seems to be the lack of a mic. input, but I've rarely used this feature on any of my other portables anyway. There's also no date/time stamp, but that feature seems to have died a long time ago and Sony dropped it completely for their 2005 models. The N510 and its 'sister' units feature, out of the box:</p>
<ul>
<li>System Controller/ATRAC DSP IC: CXD2680GA (CXD2676).</li>
<li>ATRAC Type-S, which is comprised of:
<ol>
<li>ATRAC1 Type-R.</li>
<li>ATRAC3 (MDLP) version 2.0.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Stereo, Mono and MDLP (LP2 and LP4) modes.</li>
<li>USB and line/optical inputs.</li>
<li>3V DC input.</li>
<li>5mW+5mW headphone amp with remote out, and a non-LCD remote (command codes to power backlit remotes exist).</li>
<li>Digital and analog recording level control.</li>
<li>Manual End Search/Auto End Search.</li>
<li>Recording level change and character input editing while recording.</li>
<li>Auto time mark (inserts a track mark at regular intervals during recording).</li>
<li>Group and Bookmark track function (this is actually a pretty handy feature, especially on long 30~ track LP2 compilations).</li>
<li>Quick mode (again, useful. Keeps the unit operative for up to 17 hours so response times are instant, at the expense of battery life).</li>
<li>G-Protection (as well as the standard skip protection of: 40 seconds for SP, 80 seconds for LP2 and mono and 160 seconds for LP4).</li>
<li>Digital sound presets for bass and treble.</li>
<li>Automatic Volume Limiter System - use this if, like me, you are paranoid about damaging your precious hearing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The battery life with a standard AA is very impressive. Roughly 50 hours playback and 15 recording. Battery life varies greatly between recording modes and brand, so suffice to say it's excellent. By 2003, Sony had refined the optical pickups and other mechanisms to the point where battery life is supreme, access times fast and reliability excellent. Also, a feature such as the ability to change recording levels whilst recording is something that Sony took many years to finally implement.</p>

<h3>So what about this hack then?</h3>
<p>Sony seem to use the same firmware in at least one generation of their models, and for budget models they just disable certain features, or set simpler ones. This may just be marketing (in the case of program play mode for example) or it may be because of a genuine hardware restriction in the budget model. For example, Personal Disc Memory can be enabled but low end units lack the necessary EEPROM to save the settings, so they're lost when the unit powers down. Luckily, the N510/610 and 520 can be hacked to enable a handful of very useful features. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>PGM in the P-MODE menu: Program Play Mode.</li>
<li>TITLE added to the DISPLAY menu: Scrolls the Disc Title and then the Song Title on an LCD remote.</li>
<li>SOUND added to the DISPLAY menu: displays the current sound preset.</li>
<li>A USEFUL menu added, which contains: 
	<ol>
	<li>DPC: (Digital Pitch Control) Adjustable playback speed from -50% to +100% (factor of 0.5x to 2.0x) in 13 steps <em>without</em> change of pitch.</li>
	<li>P.D.M.: Personal Disc Memory, first seen on the R900. Remembers sound settings, play mode, etc, for discs.</li>
	<li>Mtimer: Melody Timer. Set the time and it counts down and plays a little tune.</li>
	<li>AU OUT/HPhone and LINE: A software switchable line out mode!</li>
	</ol>
</li>
<li>The SOUND menu now contains:
	<ol>
	<li>S-OFF: flat, no EQ effects.</li>
	<li>V-SUR: Virtual Surround ("Virtual Headphone Technology Acoustic Engine") uses DSP to provide STUDIO, LIVE, CLUB, and ARENA effects.</li>
	<li>S-EQ: Equalizer, with seven steps of adjustment (-10dB to +10dB) in six frequency bands, with options for two custom settings plus HEAVY, POPS, JAZZ and UNIQUE presets.</li>
	</ol>
</li>
<li>Katakana editing option when titling disc/song titles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to the lack of EEPROM, the selected sound settings are not stored, so after a power down the unit will reset and then play with S-EQ turned off. Custom modes are also not saved. The Personal Disc Memory function is also pretty much useless. Everything else works, although setting the DPC or Sound EQs is limited somewhat by the small screen (if you have a later LCD remote, such as the MC38EL, you'll get a full graphical display for the speed and sound settings - hold down 'Display' to access menu options via LCD remotes). By far the most exciting addition in my opinion is the line out mode. Like every model since the R90, Sony has used a software switch for line out mode, and it shares the headphone jack. When a remote is plugged in you can't set LINE and the unit is stuck to HPhone, but when the remote isn't present LINE can be selected. This effectively boosts the volume somewhat and removes all EQ settings. Useful indeed if you hook up your portable to a bookshelf system or amplifier. I'm not sure if it's the same on the high end models, but with the ones that officially lack a line out mode the LINE setting will just max out the volume and kill any equalizer effects; This can be achieved without a hack. However, having a software setting makes it simpler and removes the risk of accidentally putting your headphones back on and forgetting the volume is set to maximum.</p>

<h3>Setting the hack</h3>
<p>To obtain these new options, you need to enter service mode on your unit. Remove any disc, make sure your unit is powered sufficiently, unplug any remotes and then switch the <span>HOLD</span> mode on. Now follow this procedure:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold down the <span>GROUP</span> button like you would a shift key, and then press this combination quite quickly: <span>» » « « » « » «</span> and then press <span>PAUSE</span> twice. Now release the <span>GROUP</span> button. Your display should now be flashing the unit's BIOS version and every single LCD element. The firmware version will most likely read <span>00 8 V1.600</span>.</li>
<li>Press <span>»</span> once, and <span>000 Manual</span> should be displayed. You can press <span>STOP</span> any time to go back a level. Press <span>»</span> again and <span>010 Laser</span> is displayed.</li>
<li>Press <span>VOL +</span> five times until <span>060 F Code</span> is displayed.</li>
<li>Press <span>»</span> once more, and you get <span>061</span> and some rolling numbers. Ignore the rolling numbers. All that is important here is the last two digits. They should read <span>00</span>. Press <span>MENU</span> to increase them by values of ten until <span>70</span> is shown, and then press <span>VOL +</span> twice to get them to <span>72</span>. Now write this new setting to Register <span>061</span> by pressing <span>PAUSE</span> once. The first stage of the hack is complete. This hack has just enabled the new Sound settings, Katakana editing, the Line Out mode and the Title display.</li>
<li>Press <span>»</span> once to move to Register <span>062</span>. After the rolling numbers, the two digits here should read <span>20</span>. To add the Program Play Mode, and the remainder of the Useful menu, change this value to <span>61</span>. Remember <span>VOL + -</span> change the value by one, and <span>MENU</span> and <span>PLAY</span> change it by ten. It's hexadecimal, so it will go 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F and not simply 1-10. Once this reads <span>61</span>, press <span>PAUSE</span> to write it, and then remove all power sources, and try out your new hacks.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Other hacking options</h3>
<p>There are other numbers that can be set in Registers 061 and 062 to enable different things, or just some of the hacks above. If you want the Line Out mode, but <em>not the 6-band EQ</em> (a lot of people prefer the old SOUND1 and SOUND2 bass and treble settings as these get stored by the unit), set Register 061 to <span>40</span> and not 72. This will also remove the Title and Sound options in the Display menu, as well as the Katakana editing option. Personally, I have my unit set to 40, since I prefer the default sound settings and can switch between these with the R900 remote. If you want the novelty of the sound hack, then the 'unique' setting is good for most types of music and gives a subtle boost to bass, midrange and treble. If you just want Katakana, and nothing else, set Register 061 <span>02</span>. You can also set Register 061 to 80 to add a 'Power Save' option in the Power menu. This will blank the display after a few seconds of inactivity, but it's been known to cause other problems, such as the battery indicator showing more power than it really has. As for Register 062, it can be set to 01 to just enable the Useful menu items, but this will <em>disable</em> the workings of the bookmark function. It can be set to 40 to add PGM but this will <em>disable</em> the Useful menu entries, so either leave this value at the default or set it to <span>61</span> and enjoy every feature.</p>

<h3>Back to defaults</h3>
<p>To reset your unit to factory defaults, Register 063 being set to <span>00</span> will cause Registers 061 and 062 to reset to their default values once the unit powers down. After this, just reset your hacks, or don't, but make sure you reset 063 back to <span>01</span>. Or you can manually just re-write the old values. The default values are: 61=00, 62=20, 63=01, 64=00.</p>

<h2 id="r700">The R700 hack</h2>
<h3>Introduction to the units</h3>
<p>This hack (and instructions) applies to the <a href="http://www.minidisc.org/part_Sony_MZ-R700.html">MZ-R700</a>, but it can also be applied to the <a href="http://www.minidisc.org/part_Sony_MZ-G750.html">MZ-G750</a> and <a href="http://www.minidisc.org/part_Sony_MZ-R500.html">MZ-R500</a> models. The information for hacking the new features into the R700 I have taken from this page, which also has more details as well as how to perform the hack on even more units: <a href="http://www.minidisc.org/mzr700_to_mzr900.html">Original hacking page.</a></p>
<p>The Rxx generation of MiniDisc portable recorders was released in 2001, and were the first MiniDisc Long Play recorders. The R900 was the much celebrated flagship model, the R700 was the middle range unit, and the R500 was the first Sony recorder to be even further stripped down; The entry level MDLP portable recorder, it lacked a microphone input as well as a remote output. The R700 was a very popular model when it was released, and its sister unit the G750 had a radio-remote, which was a first in the MD portable recorder scene. The R700's success was due to its lower cost (when compared to the expensive flagship R900) and array of features, most importantly MDLP and a microphone input. The unit's excellent design and button layout was also praised, as was battery life and build quality. It's a very solid unit and roughly 50 hours of playback can be had from a single AA battery.</p>

<h3>Features and specifications</h3>
<p>The R700, despite being the 'middle' unit and not being as well equipped as the celebrated R900, still came with many features. Out of the box, it had:</p>
<ul>
<li>System Controller/ATRAC DSP IC: CXD204GA (CXD2671).</li>
<li>ATRAC1 version 4.5, ATRAC3 (MDLP) version 1.0.</li>
<li>Stereo, Mono and MDLP (LP2 and LP4) modes.</li>
<li>Microphone (plug-in power) and line/optical inputs.</li>
<li>3V DC input.</li>
<li>5mW+5mW headphone amp with remote out, and a non-LCD remote (command codes to power backlit remotes are functional).</li>
<li>Digital and analog recording level control.</li>
<li>Manual End Search/Auto End Search.</li>
<li>Character input editing while recording.</li>
<li>G-Protection (as well as the standard skip protection of: 40 seconds for SP, 80 seconds for LP2 and mono and 160 seconds for LP4).</li>
<li>Two step bass boost.</li>
<li>Automatic Volume Limiter System (AVLS)</li>
</ul>
<p>The R900 was the flagship unit of the 2001 generation. It was actually released in Japan in August, 2000 and as a result a fair amount of evolution had taken place by the time the generation's other units appeared. The result was that the R700, G750 and R500 actually had a more advanced ATRAC DSP installed that contained the new Type-R codec (Type-R had in fact been around since 1998, but took a while to trickle down to the portable recorders). Since this wasn't on the R900 Sony had this disabled on the other units. The R900 was still the flagship model, so lesser units couldn't be seen to have a more advanced recording system. Full information on this can be read on a <a href="http://www.audiotstation.com/forum/showthread.php?t=29895">thread at the T-Station forums</a>.</p>

<h3>So what about this hack then?</h3>
<p>The R700 can be hacked to add the following working features:</p>
<ul>
<li>All play modes: All, All Repeat, 1 Track, 1 Track Repeat, Shuffle, Shuffle Repeat, Program, Program Repeat.</li>
<li>M-Timer (an alarm clock that can be set in minutes).</li>
<li>Auto time mark (inserts a track mark at regular intervals during recording).</li>
<li>Titling in Japanese Katakana character set (as well as the normal Roman alphabet).</li>
<li>Improved ATRAC1 recording codec: version 4.5 replaced with Type-R.</li>
</ul>
<p>The hack also reveals further options in the menu system, but due to hardware limitations and restrictions in the circuitry/command codes these cannot be used. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal Disc Memory (remembers volume, program play, equalizer, and speed settings for 20 discs).</li>
<li>Instead of simple two step bass boost:
	<ol>
	<li>Tone control settings beyond simple bass boost: 8 step bass and treble settings.</li>
	<li>Selectable stored equalizer settings (SOUND1, SOUND2).</li>
	</ol>
</li>
<li>Selectable LINE/HEADPHONE output from audio jack.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even <em>with</em> the R900's <a href="http://www.minidisc.org/images/sony_rmmc11el.jpg">RM-MC11EL</a> remote the sound settings cannot be changed (it does in fact change its readout to 'bass 1/2' instead of 'sound 1/2' when used with an unhacked R700), nor can the unit actually switch to a genuine line out mode, again due to circuitry restrictions. So all in all, not that many extras, unlike the N510 hack. This hack apparently does allow a digital pitch control (speed settings) when used with the R900 remote, but after testing I've found this to be untrue. You also can't alter the microphone sensitivity like you can with the R900. Plus, only the R900 has the battery back up clock to allow a date/time stamp to be performed when recording.</p>
<p>Personally, I recommend not bothering with the features hack. The treble can't be changed with the extra sound settings, so in effect you still are choosing between a bass level of 0, 1 or 3. The other features just aren't really worth it. The R900's other strengths were the date/time stamp and the proper line out mode. However, I do recommend you set the Type-R hack.</p>

<h3>Setting the hack</h3>
<p>To obtain these new options, you need to enter service mode on your unit. Remove any disc, make sure your unit is powered sufficiently, unplug any remotes and then switch the <span>HOLD</span> mode on. Now follow this procedure:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hold down the <span>VOL -</span> button like you would a shift key, and then press this combination quite quickly: <span>» » « « » « » «</span> and then press <span>PAUSE</span> twice. Now release the <span>VOL -</span> button. Your display should now be flashing the unit's BIOS version and every single LCD element. The firmware version will most likely read <span>V1.300 00 4</span>.</li>
<li>Press <span>VOL +</span> and <span>Manual 0 00</span> should be displayed.</li>
<li>Press <span>PLAY</span> and <span>Laser 0 10</span> should be displayed.</li>
<li>Press <span>VOL +</span> five times until <span>F Code 0 60</span> is displayed.</li>
<li>Press <span>PLAY</span> and you'll see three rolling numbers (ignore these) and <span>S90</span>. The last two digits are the ones that need to be changed. <span>0 61</span> should be on the right.</li>
<li>Press <span>VOL +</span> until instead of 90, the digits read <span>F7</span>. <span>VOL -</span> will reduce the digit if you go past.</li>
<li>Press <span>PAUSE</span> to write this setting here. This enables the extra sound settings, the line out and Katakana editing.</li>
<li>Press <span>PLAY</span> and you'll see three rolling numbers again, followed by <span>S20</span>. The far right should read <span>0 62</span>.</li>
<li>Press <span>VOL +</span> until instead of 20, the digits read <span>7B</span>. <span>VOL -</span> will reduce the digit if you go past.</li>
<li>Press <span>PAUSE</span> to write this setting here. This enables the personal disc memory, the extra play modes, the melody timer, and the auto time mark.</li>
<li>Remove the battery to exit service mode. Now try out the new features.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Enabling the ATRAC1 Type-R DSP codec</h3>
<p>If you wish to perform recording tests with the two codecs make a recording <em>before</em> you apply the Type-R hack, or at least note down the values. The original values are: <span>S00 867</span> and <span>S20 868</span> (thanks to Geert-Jan Tielen).</p>
<p>Once again, enter service mode as you did above and then at the firmware screen follow these instructions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <span>VOL + VOL - VOL -</span> and <span>Keisu 8 00</span> should be displayed.</li>
<li>Press <span>PLAY</span> and then <span>VOL +</span> five times.</li>
<li>Press <span>PLAY</span> seven times. You should see <span>8 67</span> at the far right.</li>
<li>Using the <span>VOL + -</span> keys change the value to <span>S67</span> then press <span>PAUSE</span> to save.</li>
<li>Press <span>PLAY</span> to advance to Register <span>8 68</span> and change the value here to <span>S01</span> and <span>PAUSE</span> again to save.</li>
<li>Now exit service mode.</li>
</ol>
<p>ATRAC1 Type-R should now be enabled on your R700 unit (or R500, G750). This is the final evolution to Sony's ATRAC1 (SP) recording codec and should yield superior results to the 4.5 version the R700 is shipped with. This also makes the R700 a superior unit to the R900 when it comes to real-time SP recording quality.</p>

<h3>Back to defaults</h3>
<p>To reset your unit to factory defaults, Register 063 being set to <span>00</span> will cause Registers 061 and 062 to reset to their default values once the unit powers down. After this, just reset your hacks, or don't, but make sure you reset 063 back to <span>01</span>. Or you can manually just re-write the old values. The default values are: 61=90, 62=20, 63=01, 64=00.</p>

<p>Forty years of programming</p><hr>


<p>I am about to turn forty-six. This means I have been programming for forty years, half of them professionally. During most of that time, I used a "standard" setup with 104 keyboard, a flat mouse, and a sitting desk.</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/40/macpro.webp" width="1932" height="1152"><span><i><small>My home workstation circa 2011 (porting Doom III to mac)</small></i></span>
 
<p>Things evolved ten years ago when I started to experience pain in my forearms and shoulders when I programmed. Here is what I did to solve my problem, it may work for someone else.</p>


<p>Mouse</p><hr>
<p>
Using a vertical mouse improved things a lot. My favorite is the Evoluent VerticalMouse 4.
</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/40/vertical_mouse.webp" width="2650" height="1665"><span><i><small>My work workstation circa 2015</small></i></span>

<p>Eventually, I opted for the Magic Trackpad from Apple. It is great to switch workspace with three fingers, zoom, and more. Having it in the center allows me to use it alternatively with my left and right hand.</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/40/magic.webp" width="2955" height="1368"><span><i><small>My home workstation circa 2015</small></i></span>

<p> It used to be annoying to get the drivers for Linux/Windows but now it is all sorted out.</p>

<p>Keyboard</p><hr><p>The first ergonomic keyboard I tried was the <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/freestyle2-for-pc-us/">KINESIS Freestyle2</a>. It allowed me to spread each half as needed, resulting in horizontally straight wrist . However, the standard <code>Control</code>, <code>Shift</code>, and <code>Alt</code> still required wrist gymnastics. Same thing for <code>Esc</code> (I talk about VIM later) which required a left wrist twist. Also the tenting angle was too low.</p>

<p>I tried the <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/">KINESIS Advantage2</a>. I liked the concept of having so many thumb options. But the fixed width was a step backward compared to the KINESIS Freestyle2.</p>

<p>The keyboard which has it all for me is the  <a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/">Ergodox EZ</a>. It can be as wide or narrow as I need. And the custom firmware is a highly customizable gem. Among many features, it can switch all keys into a different layer with a single keystroke. The silver bullet for me is the ability to have a key function change if you keep it pressed.</p>

<p> If you look at <a href="https://configure.zsa.io/ergodox-ez/layouts/9qw4W/latest/0">my layout</a> you can see how capitalization (<code>Shift</code>) can be done by maintaining pressed either <code>D</code> or <code>K</code>.  All my symbols <code>{</code>, <code>[</code>, <code>(</code>, ... are on another layer available from a single key maintained pressed.</p> 


<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/40/ergodox_ez.webp" width="2622" height="1569"><span><i><small>My work keyboard in 2023</small></i></span>

<p>With the Ergodox EZ, my wrists never move. They are always in a rest position, on all three axes. Zero pain and I can program all day.</p>


<p>Additionally, the Ergodox accepts hardware tuning, like <a href="https://drop.com/buy/carbon">DROP Carbon keycaps</a>, custom cables by <a href="https://www.pexonpcs.co.uk/">pexonpcs.co.uk</a>, and <a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/gateron-switch-set">Brown Gateron G Pro.</a></p>


<blockquote><b>Trivia:</b> As a fan of IBM's Model M clicky keyboard, I tried to build my first Ergo using Cherry MX Blue. That was fine for home but made some coworkers upset. I recommend going for Cherry MX Red which are the most silent, or the Cherry MX Brown which are a good middle ground between Blue and Red.</blockquote>


<p>VIM</p><hr><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/40/vim.svg" width="544.16998" height="544.8642"><p>As you will have guessed my goal is to move my hands and twist my wrists as little as possible. That would be a problem to navigate a program since most IDEs require clicking via the mouse. Thankfully, most editors have a VIM mode which allows you to move across a file, goto definition, go back, all that without using the mouse.</p>


<p>Desk</p><hr><p>Standing up improves my posture. I don't slouch when I stand. So I built a motorized standing desk with <a href="https://amzn.to/48xIGKc">Topsky legs</a> and a Home Depot <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Hampton-Bay-4-ft-L-x-25-in-D-Unfinished-Birch-Butcher-Block-Countertop-in-With-Standard-Edge-birch-4ft-x-25in/319222041">butcher counter top</a>.</p>



<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/40/desk.webp" width="2640" height="1988"><span><i><small>My home desk, at the time used for amazing Diablo 2 Resurrected adventures</small></i></span>

<p>The three position memory allow to switch from standing to seating within a few seconds. And I try to alternate during the day.</p>



<p>Stretching</p><hr><p>I take a break every once in a while and do a bunch of Wall Angel.</p>

<p>Meditation in motion</p><hr><p>I manage my stress level by disconnecting from work when I leave it. Rock climbing works well for me. You can't think of anything else when you climb. It is a great way to turn off a brain that keeps on having great optimization ideas when it is not the time anymore.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://marvinh.dev/blog/speeding-up-javascript-ecosystem-part-7/">https://marvinh.dev/blog/speeding-up-javascript-ecosystem-part-7/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37814701">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>📖 tl;dr: Many projects are littered with files that just re-export other files. These so called "barrel files" are one of the key reasons why JavaScript tooling is slow in bigger projects.</p><div>
						<p>Let's imagine you are working on a big project with many files. You add a new file to work on a new feature and import a function from another directory into your code.</p>
						<pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> foo <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./some/other-file"</span><span>;</span><p><span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>myCoolCode</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>	<span>// Pretend that this is super smart code :)</span><br>	<span>const</span> result <span>=</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>	<span>return</span> result<span>;</span><br><span>}</span></p></code></pre>
						<p>Excited about finishing your feature, you run the code and realize that it takes an awfully long time to complete. The code you've written is pretty straight forward and shouldn't consume that much time. Concerned by this, you sprinkle in some measuring code to see how long your function took to do its thing.</p>
						<pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> foo <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./some/other-file"</span><span>;</span><p><span>export</span> <span>function</span> <span>myCoolCode</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>	<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>time</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>	<span>const</span> result <span>=</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>	<span>console</span><span>.</span><span>timeEnd</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>	<span>return</span> result<span>;</span><br><span>}</span></p></code></pre>
						<p>You run the code again, and to your surprise the measurements you inserted show that it's blazing fast™. You repeat the measuring steps, but this time insert the <code>console.time()</code> statements in the main entry file of your project and run the code again. But no dice, the logged measurements just confirm that your code itself is super fast. What is happening?</p>
						<p>Well, strap in. This is the story of the devastating effects barrel files have on your code.</p>
						<h2>Gathering more information</h2>
						<p>The key piece of information we have obtained so far is that the runtime of the code isn't the issue. You measured it, and it was a fraction of the total time. This means we can assume that all the other time is wasted either <em>before</em> or <em>after</em> running our code. From experience when it comes to tooling, the time is usually spent before running the project code.</p>
						<p>You got an idea: You remember hearing that some npm packages pre-bundle their code for performance reasons. Maybe this could help here? You decide to test that theory and bundle your code with <a href="https://esbuild.github.io/">esbuild</a> into a single file. You purposely disable any forms of minifications, because you want your code to be as close as possible to the original source.</p>
						<p>Upon completion, you then run the bundled file to repeat the experiment and voilá, it finishes in a blink of an eye. Out of curiosity, you measure the time it takes to run esbuild <em>and</em> run the bundled file together and notice that both of them combined are still quicker than running the original source code. Huh? What is going on?</p>
						<p>Then it hits you: The main thing a bundler does is flatten and merge the module graph. What was once composed of thousands of files, is merged into a single file thanks to esbuild. This would be a strong indicator that the size of the module graph is the true problem here. And barrel files are the main cause of that.</p>
						<h2>Anatomy of a barrel file</h2>
						<p>Barrel files are files that only export other files and contain no code themselves. As a non-native speaker that term is confusing to me, but let's roll with it. In the days before editors had auto imports and other niceties, many developers tried to keep the number of import statements they had to write by hand to a minimum.</p>
						<pre><code><span>// Look at all these imports</span><br><span>import</span> <span>{</span> foo <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"../foo"</span><span>;</span><br><span>import</span> <span>{</span> bar <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"../bar"</span><span>;</span><br><span>import</span> <span>{</span> baz <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"../baz"</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
						<p>This gave rise to a pattern where every folder got its own <code>index.js</code> file that merely re-exported code from other files in usually the same directory. In a way this amortized the manual typing work because once such a file is in place, all the other code only needs to reference one import statement.</p>
						<pre><code><span>// feature/index.js</span><br><span>export</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./foo"</span><span>;</span><br><span>export</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./bar"</span><span>;</span><br><span>export</span> <span>*</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./baz"</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
						<p>The previously shown import statements can now be collapsed into a single line.</p>
						<pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> foo<span>,</span> bar<span>,</span> baz <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"../feature"</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
						<p>After a while, this pattern spreads throughout the codebase and every folder in your project has an <code>index.js</code> file. Kinda neat, isn't it? Well, no.</p>
						<h2>Everything is not fine</h2>
						<p>In such a setup a module very likely imports another barrel file which pulls in a bunch of other files, which then imports yet another barrel file and so on. Ultimately, you typically end up importing every single file in your project through a spiderweb of import statements. And the bigger the project, the longer it takes to load all of these modules.</p>
						<p>Ask yourself: What's quicker? Having to load 30k files or just 10? Probably only loading 10 files is faster.</p>
						<p>It's a common misconception among JavaScript developers that modules would only be loaded when needed. This is not true, because doing so would break code relying on globals or module execution order.</p>
						<pre><code><span>// a.js</span><br>globalThis<span>.</span>foo <span>=</span> <span>123</span><span>;</span><p><span>// b.js</span><br>console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>globalThis<span>.</span>foo<span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// should log: 123</span></p><p><span>// index.js</span><br><span>import</span> <span>"./a"</span><span>;</span><br><span>import</span> <span>"./b"</span><span>;</span></p></code></pre>
						<p>If the engine wouldn't load the first <code>./a</code> import, then the code would unexpectedly log <code>undefined</code> instead of <code>123</code>.</p>
						<h2>Effects of barrel files on performance</h2>
						<p>It gets worse when you take tools like test runners in consideration. In the popular jest test runner, each test file is executed in its own child process. In effect, this means that every single test file constructs the module graph from scratch and has to pay for that cost. If constructing the module graph in a project takes 6s and you have - let's say - only 100 test files, then you waste 10 minutes in total to repeatedly construct the module graph. No test or any other code is being run during that time. It's just the time the engine needs to prepare the source code so that it can then be run.</p>
						<p>Another area where barrel files gravely affect performance is any sort of import cycle linting rules. Typically linters are run on a file-by-file basis, which means the cost of constructing the module graph needs to be paid for every single file. It's not uncommon that this alone causes linting times to spiral out of control and suddenly linting takes a couple of hours in a bigger project.</p>
						<p>To get some raw numbers, I've generated a project with files importing each other to get a better sense of the cost of constructing the module graph. Every file is empty and contains no code other than import statements. Timings are measured on my MacBook M1 Air (2020).</p>
						<p><img src="https://marvinh.dev/media/js-tools-module-cost.png" alt="Loading 500 empty modules takes 0.15s, 1000 take 0.31s, 10000 take 3.12s, 25000 take 16.81s, 50000 take 48.44s"></p>
						<p>As you can see, loading fewer modules is very much worth it. Let's apply these numbers to a project with 100 test files where a test runner is used that spawns a new child process for each test file. Let's be generous here and say that our test runner can run 4 tests in parallel:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>500 modules: <code>0.15s * 100 / 4</code> = <code>3.75s</code> overhead</li>
							<li>1000 modules: <code>0.31s * 100 / 4</code> = <code>7.75s</code> overhead</li>
							<li>10000 modules: <code>3.12s * 100 / 4</code> = <code>1:18m</code> overhead</li>
							<li>25000 modules: <code>16.81s * 100 / 4</code> = <code>~7:00m</code> overhead</li>
							<li>50000 modules: <code>48.44s * 100 / 4</code> = <code>~20:00m</code> overhead</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Since this is a synthetic setup, these are lowball numbers. In a real project these numbers are likely worse. Barrel files are not good when it comes to tooling performance.</p>
						<h2>What to do</h2>
						<p>Having only a handful of barrel files in your code is usually fine, but it gets problematic when every single folder has one. It's unfortunately not a rare occurrence in the JavaScript industry.</p>
						<p>So if you work on a project which uses barrel files extensively, there is a free optimization you can apply that makes many tasks 60-80% faster:</p>
						<p>Get rid of all barrel files.</p>

<p>You may have heard that two pieces of similar metal will bond together if they touch each other in space. In theory this is correct, although in real life we wouldn't expect it to happen quite that easily.</p>
<p>If two pieces of similar metals touch in a vacuum, and if both pieces are perfectly flat and polished, they will indeed fuse to effectively make one new piece. Atoms in the metals share electrons and bond permanently. This is called <em>cold welding</em>.</p>
<p>The reason this doesn't happen in everyday life is that there is always some kind of barrier between the pure metals. In particular, most metals form an oxide layer on any surface that is exposed to air. This acts as a shield to prevent bonding.</p>
<p>In the vacuum of space, there is no air so metals wouldn't form the protective layer. In practice, however, any metals that astronauts use should still have their oxidation layer from when they were exposed to air. In addition, astronauts' tools are coated with plastic.</p>
<p>Although it's not a common problem in space, it has happened<sup>1</sup> and space engineers need to be aware of the issue<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>Note that there are numerous variations of cold welding. Some types of cold welding can be done on Earth without a vacuum. A particular type of alignment or friction may be required for the bonding to take place. </p>

  <div>
        
            <div><p>As many of you will know from personal experience, there is a longstanding issue with VoiceOver on Mac where Safari will frequently become unresponsive with VoiceOver repeatedly announcing the message “Safari not responding.” When this issue occurs, the user's Mac may become unusable for up to several minutes at a time. Sometimes it can be resolved by switching away from Safari. Sometimes restarting VoiceOver can resolve the issue. However, far too often, the user is unable to switch away from Safari or turn VoiceOver off, instead having to simply wait for their Mac to become responsive again.</p>

<p>This “Safari not responding” behaviour when using VoiceOver dramatically impacts productivity and overall usability of Macs for blind and low vision users. Furthermore, it appears that the issue extends beyond just Safari - many other common applications that utilise Apple's WebKit browser engine can also be affected by the “not responding” problem.</p>

<p>It is also important to point out this issue occurs regardless of the specification level of the Mac - it has been widely experienced on the latest Apple silicon-equipped Macs with 16GB or more of RAM, so even owners of top-tier new Mac hardware still face this crippling VoiceOver bug.</p>

<p>This critical problem has persisted for years across multiple MacOS versions without a permanent fix from Apple. Given the longevity and level of disruption caused by this bug across Safari and other applications, I can unfortunately no longer in good faith recommend Macs to anyone who relies on using VoiceOver. The impact of this bug when performing routine, and often critical, tasks in Safari and other applications simply makes macOS an unreliable and frustrating platform.</p>

<p>Macs have traditionally been popular within the blind community, and they offer some great accessibility features. However, frankly, Apple should be utterly ashamed that they have let this issue persist for so long without a permanent fix. It's a failing that raises serious questions about the company's frequently stated commitment to accessibility. There can be no doubt that if sighted users were to experience something similar, that it would receive significant media coverage and that Apple's response would be fast.</p>

<p>I want to note that I am sympathetic to the difficulties Apple's engineering team likely faces in resolving this issue. Based on user reports, there appears to be no consistent way to reproduce the “Safari not responding” behaviour - it can occur randomly and sporadically. The same web page may work fine multiple times before suddenly triggering a freeze. There are also inconsistencies across different users, machines, and configurations. I imagine these factors make it very challenging to isolate and fix the underlying problem. However, given the engineering talent and resources available to Apple, the challenge should not be insurmountable.</p>

<p>I believe we need to escalate out urging of Apple to prioritise and permanently solve the “Safari not responding” bug that has plagued VoiceOver users for far too long. To this end, I encourage those of you who use VoiceOver on Mac to directly contact Apple's accessibility team at <a href="mailto:accessibility@apple.com">accessibility@apple.com</a> to share your own personal experiences with and frustrations about the “Safari not responding” issue. It is important we continue putting direct, polite pressure on Apple to prioritise resolving this problem. Please be constructive in expressing your concerns. Consider also copying Apple CEO Tim Cook on your email by using his publicly shared email address <a href="mailto:tcook@apple.com">tcook@apple.com</a> to ensure he sees the direct impact this ongoing bug is having on Apple's blind and low vision customers.</p>

<p>I want to emphasise that the “Safari not responding” bug is far from the only issue effecting VoiceOver users on Mac. As <a href="https://www.applevis.com/blog/macos-sonoma-new-features-changes-improvements-bugs-blind-low-vision-users">our recent post on problems in macOS Sonoma and the replies outline,</a> there are numerous other VoiceOver frustrations and failures impacting users. However, it has become a yardstick by which Apple's overall performance on and commitment to accessibility is being judged. It is a yardstick against which Apple has failed for some considerable time.</p>

<p>I know many of you share my frustration. I welcome your perspectives and discussion in the comments. Collectively, we need to apply consumer pressure by being vocal about this issue and not purchasing new Macs until the “Safari not responding” issue is fixed once and for all. Apple simply must do better and restore our trust that Macs provide a stable and fully accessible experience for its blind and low vision customers.</p></div>

            <p>Maybe I have been very lucky, but I have not experienced the same level of frustration with my Mac. I have been using a MacBook Air since 2013, and my current Mac is a 2020 M1 MacBook Air with 8 GB of RAM. While I have occasionally encountered the  "Safari not responding" issue, I could easily work around this by turning VO off and on. I use my Mac for creating documents, working with spreadsheets, using the Internet, managing my music library, handling emails, among other things. Based on my experience, I would have no problem recommending a Mac to a blind user. Of course, each person must determine their own use case.<br>
Over the past ten years, I have encountered numerous bugs but none of them were show stoppers for me. I imagine that Windows with JAWS or NVDA also has its share of bugs.<br>
Given that this bug seems to not affect all Mac users with the same severity, this may make it a more difficult issue for Apple to address. However, given the comments that I have read on Applevis, I agree that this should be a priority for their Accessibility team.</p>
