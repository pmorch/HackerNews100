<p>Until recently, and for well over the past decade, my wife and I have been nomads. Moving from the Caribbean to Miami, New York, Las Vegas, Vancouver, and now back home. This has meant that for many of those years, my home office basically comprised of a few laptops and screens.</p>
<p>These days, we are more settled; my wife has completed her studies, works full-time, and my full-time job remains remote, via a home office <a href="https://linuxblog.io/web-server-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">supporting Linux servers</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://stacklinux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hosting them</a>.</p>
<p>After a short trip to Antigua, I had a brief meeting with a tech friend of mine, <a href="http://www.yvesephraim.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yves Ephraim</a>. He was an Engineer with <a href="https://www.cwnetworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cable &amp; Wireless</a> for 20 years (until 2003). Yves left C&amp;W shortly before I started there in 2004. He’s a champion of the internet and&nbsp;technological developments in Antigua &amp; Barbuda.</p>
<p>We sat in his home office, where he told me a bit about his current projects, as well as his dabbling with <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IPv6</a>, web hosting, mail, <a href="https://www.bgp4.as/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BGP4</a>, among other things. Most of which he does via his very capable home lab.</p>

<h2><span id="What_is_a_Home_Lab"></span>What is a Home Lab?<span></span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" title="My Home Lab - 2020" src="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/my_homelab-868x868.jpg" alt="My Home Lab - 2020" width="868" height="868" srcset="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/my_homelab-868x868.jpg 868w, https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/my_homelab-300x300.jpg 300w, https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/my_homelab-560x560.jpg 560w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px" loading="eager" fetchpriority="high"><br>
<em>My current Home lab in a 12u rack as of May 2020</em></p>
<p>Think of a home lab as&nbsp;a place where you can fail in the privacy of your own home. As Thomas A. Edison said: <em>“I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.”</em> I consider myself an expert at failure. But seriously, I would like to fail a lot more, and a home lab will create endless opportunities for me to fail. Of course, all the while seeking success, but you got that already.</p>
<p>In general, a lab is a place where you can safely perform experiments. Most of you reading this article are techies and sysadmins. As you know, trying out new things on production equipment never ends well. Shush… it’s OK, I know, I know, you didn’t think that one command would take everything offline. This risk is the reason why we build ourselves a sandbox environment to dabble, test, and fail in, all from the comfort of our own homes.</p>
<p>To date, I host my test labs on servers in North America and Europe. I’m creating a customized network and server home lab; to fill those areas where I would like to become more familiar. I will also be using my home lab for remote backups, <a href="https://linuxblog.io/20-top-server-monitoring-application-performance-monitoring-apm-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">network monitoring and alerting of remote servers</a>, and wired UAP APs, among other things.</p>
<h2><span id="May_we_inspire_each_other_to_great_home_labs"></span>May we inspire each other to great home labs<span></span></h2>
<p>As I told Yves, our chat had me revisiting the idea. In fact, I think my exact words were, “Yves, I see your home lab, and I’ll raise you mine.” As always, I’m certain there’s a lot more to learn through discussion. In light of this fact, I wanted to share this journey with you, starting with the hardware selection process for my home lab.</p>
<p>Of course, over the years, I’ve had equipment lying around, but that stops today. Well, sort of. So, if you have ever been interested in building a home lab or if you already have one, then <a href="https://linuxcommunity.io/t/how-to-build-a-homelab/49" target="_blank" rel="noopener">let’s mingle, share and dabble together</a>.</p>
<p>Where do we begin? Not to sound cliché, but let’s start from the ground up, or wall forward. What I’m trying to say is, we need storage space, physical storage space, for our new home lab.</p>
<h2><span id="Home_lab_location_its_all_about_location"></span>Home lab location, it’s all about location.<span></span></h2>
<p>Location, Location, Location. It’s all about location! Please excuse the lack of originality – I’m a sysadmin, not a writer. I’ll try my best to get you to the end of this article.</p>
<p>Location is critical for several reasons. The choice between the home office, living room, closet, attic, basement, or garage depends on a range of important variables. These include room temperature and ventilation, workable space around your equipment, ease and distance of network cable runs, foot traffic, 24-hour ease of access, power, noise levels from your home lab, and more.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick list of Pros vs. Cons I’ve compiled to get us thinking about all the possible home lab locations. Choose wisely:</p>
<p><strong>Home office</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: Proximity to work area/desk/devices, fewer cable runs, and you can watch lights flash all day.</li>
<li>Cons: no home office or you already spend too much time in your home office.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Living room</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: Usually cool, lots of space/setup options, blinky-blinky sci-fi movie nights, and counts as family time.</li>
<li>Cons: divorce, foot traffic, could get damaged, or damaged during the divorce.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Closet</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: Easily accessible, stealthy, and you get to say: “Look at what I have hiding in my closet.”</li>
<li>Cons: Poor ventilation (excess heat), lack of space, and one less closet = unhappy wife.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Basement</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: Usually cooler temps, and volunteering to do laundry (maybe con?).</li>
<li>Cons: don’t have a basement, flooding, spiders, or no access when injured.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Attic</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: Less noise, easier cable runs.</li>
<li>Cons: can get hot depending on where you live, roof leaks, humidity/condensation, and creepy at night.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Garage</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pros: Less noise in the house, completely out of sight, wife won’t even notice.</li>
<li>Cons: A Bug’s Life <em>in</em> your lab, excess heat (if no AC), dust, could require longer cables, or gets wrecked when parking the car.</li>
</ul>
<p>For my lab, I’m going to build it out in my home office. I have laptops, a desktop, a server, and other devices in my office, so that this location will require shorter cable runs. When selecting your location, consider the coolest area of the room/space, avoid direct sunlight and consider reserving space for future expansion.</p>
<p>It’s wise if you draw/sketch out a home network diagram or <a href="https://www.smartdraw.com/network-diagram/how-to-draw-network-diagrams.htm">use network design software</a>. Keep in mind your floor plan and how you will accomplish the cable runs. For example, most of the homes on this island have 8″ concrete interior walls. Think about these things before, not after. In other words, map everything out, make notes and create lists.</p>
<h2><span id="Network_vs_Server_Racks_vs_Cabinets"></span>Network vs. Server Racks vs. Cabinets?<span></span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" title="home lab rack vs cabinet" src="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/home_lab_rack_vs_cabinet-868x399.jpg" alt="home lab rack vs cabinet" width="868" height="399" srcset="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/home_lab_rack_vs_cabinet.jpg 868w, https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/home_lab_rack_vs_cabinet-300x138.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="low"></p>
<p>Next, we need to decide how we will store the equipment (modems, routers, switches, servers, patch panels, UPS systems, power strips, cooling fans, etc.).</p>
<p>Network cabinets and racks are often confused with S<em>erver</em> cabinets and racks. R<span><span>outers</span></span>, switches, patch panels, and the like are usually much shallower than servers. As such, Network Cabinets and Racks are usually not as deep as Server Cabinets and Racks. Also, networking devices often produce less heat than servers. You will find some network cabinets will have glass doors that may not leave enough ventilation for servers.</p>
<p>After deciding the depth and ventilation requirements for your home lab, there are a couple of other things to consider. A cabinet is an enclosed space with door(s) and/or removable sides, whereas a rack is a semi or fully open (4 sides open) frame. To help you decide whether to use a cabinet or rack, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are <strong>installing large, heavy servers</strong>, then the extra stability of cabinets or four-sided racks should be considered.</li>
<li>If you <strong>need frequent access</strong> to the sides or rear of equipment, then an open rack or cabinet with removable sides would work well.</li>
<li>If your <strong>equipment requires extra cooling</strong>, an enclosed cabinet will need more attention to cooling and ventilation.</li>
<li>If the <strong>room is prone to dust</strong>, the extra protection of a cabinet will go a long way in keeping it out of your equipment.</li>
<li>If you are <strong>installing in a general living area</strong> frequented by house guests, consider an enclosed cabinet that can often look neater in appearance when locked. However, a well-maintained open rack with tidy power and network cable runs can look just as neat!</li>
<li>If <strong>restricted access/security</strong> is required, many enclosed cabinets often offer lock and key access control for better security.</li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I’ve updated the article. Some of the devices mentioned have been discontinued or are not readily accessible anymore. I’ve updated with upgrades I’ve made and other recommended hardware and accessories. It’s been nearly four years since my original homelab build.</em></p>
<p>Now that you have already measured your equipment’s maximum depth and considered all the above advice, it’s time to buy your first piece of hardware. Or not. You could have probably skipped to this section if you prefer more em’, creative methods for hosting your home lab. However, most of the above advice applies even if you plan to set up your home lab in your existing living room cabinet, on a bookshelf, under your desk, or in a cardboard box. No, seriously…</p>

<h3><span id="To_replace_or_not_to_replace_ISP_Cable_Modem"></span>To replace or not to replace: ISP Cable Modem<span></span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="replace cable modem" src="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/replace_cable_modem-868x196.jpg" alt="replace cable modem" width="868" height="196" srcset="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/replace_cable_modem.jpg 868w, https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/replace_cable_modem-300x68.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="low"></p>
<p>Before we delve a bit deeper into my home lab recommendations, if you are a beginner to switching and routing, then a lot of the hardware below may seem to be a bit of an overkill. You can get your feet wet by merely replacing your ISP’s cable modem (ISP or Internet Service Provider), you know, that thing with all the flashing lights that you frequently have to unplug to reset to regain internet access. Yup, that one, the mini heater in your living room.</p>
<p>Most US ISPs charge monthly rental for that thing. Buying your own could make some financial sense. As well as giving better performance, reliability, and security. Bet you were already sold with the financial bit eh? But it gets better; most of these modems provided by ISPs are usually of poor quality, used, and lack features. Lastly, your ISP’s Modem/Router combos often cannot independently update firmware versions as new exploits emerge. This means you are at the mercy of your ISP to push new patched firmware.</p>
<p>If you have a great ISP and this does not apply to you, stick with your modem. The only reason to replace it in such circumstances will be to have access to additional network features and create a home lab where you can test away! I replaced the modem/router combo from my ISP. I went with the <a href="https://amzn.to/32lbV1h" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Motorola MB7420 16×4 Cable Modem</a>. <em>Update: 3 years later, there are much faster models, for example, the <span id="productTitle"><a href="https://amzn.to/3ZwNtrn">Motorola MB7621 32×8</a>.</span></em></p>
<p>If you would like to keep things simple, then go with a <a href="https://amzn.to/3a5Lmzx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modem + Wi-Fi router combo</a>. Otherwise, continue if you would like to build out a home lab to manage Firewall, NAS storage, VPN, VLANs, PoE (Power over Ethernet), Virtualization, remote network infrastructure monitoring/alerting, wired APs, web servers, backup servers, the list goes on.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> This modem, similar to most I’ve used, gives off quite a bit of heat. When deciding placement, I would suggest toward the top or leave space below and above. That said, I love this modem! Unlike the ISP’s modem, it shows the quality of your connection, including Freq. (MHz), Pwr (dBmV), SNR (dB), corrected and uncorrected, and even allows manual downstream frequency setting if needed by your ISP.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<h3><span id="Selecting_Your_Home_Lab_Rack"></span>Selecting Your Home Lab Rack<span></span></h3>
<p>A rack <em>unit</em>&nbsp;(abbreviated&nbsp;<em>U</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>RU</em>) is a unit of measure defined as 1 3⁄4 inches (or 44.45 mm). It’s the unit of measurement for the height of 19-inch and 23-inch rack frames and the equipment’s height. The height of the frame/equipment is expressed as multiples of rack units. A typical full-size rack is 42U high. Racks and cabinets are then listed as 1U, 2U, 3U, 4U, and so on.</p>
<p>Here’s an example below of a 6U rack (labeled):</p>
<p><img decoding="async" title="6u rack example" src="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/6u-rack-2-868x583.jpg" alt="6u rack example" width="868" height="583" srcset="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/6u-rack-2.jpg 868w, https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/6u-rack-2-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="low"></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/39XLcdz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StarTech 12U Wall Mount Rack – 13.5″ Deep / 19″ wide / 125lbs Capacity</a> – $158 (<a href="https://www.startech.com/Server-Management/Racks/12u-wall-mount-rack~WALLMNT12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specs</a>) – During my search for a wall-mounted rack, I almost purchased the 6U version of this rack, then at the last minute, I switched to the 12U version for possible future expansion.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2STvDy3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samson SRK-12 Universal Equipment Rack Stand</a>&nbsp;– $230 (<a href="http://www.samsontech.com/samson/products/accessories/racks/srk8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specs</a>) – This was my first choice; this is an audio equipment rack that is fully compatible with shallow-mount equipment. One advantage is that it’s supported on wheels, so you don’t have to fix it to a wall or floor. However, I’m 6′ 2″, and I want to mount my rack about 4′ off the ground, so as you will see, I have also purchased a 2U cooling fan (intake), which I will place at or to the bottom of my setup. If your room is air-conditioned 24/7 and you don’t mind the low-to-floor setup, this may be the rack for you. Here’s a <a href="https://imgur.com/BAGlEvA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">great example of how clean this Rack can look when set up</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3974q0c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NavePoint 9U Basic IT Wall Mount Network Rack Locking Glass Door</a> – $235 (<a href="https://navepoint.com/navepoint-9u-450mm-depth-wallmount-networking-cabinet-assembled-basic-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specs</a>) – This is a very beautiful-looking Network Cabinet. The issue for me is that I only use the AC in my office in the summer, and I don’t want the heat ever to be an issue; thus, for my home setup, an enclosed cabinet wasn’t right for me.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Update:&nbsp;</strong>This is a very solid wall-mount rack. I can confirm that what you see is what you get. No issues to report. It does exactly what it’s supposed to.</em></p>
<h3><span id="Home_Lab_UPS_Uninterruptible_Power_Supply"></span>Home Lab UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)<span></span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" title="CyberPower OR500LCDRM1U" src="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CyberPower-OR500LCDRM1U-868x99.jpg" alt="CyberPower OR500LCDRM1U" width="868" height="99" srcset="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CyberPower-OR500LCDRM1U.jpg 868w, https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/CyberPower-OR500LCDRM1U-300x34.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="low"></p>
<p>At home, we have a backup generator that runs on propane. It can run for up to a week, which is useful in the tropics. Other than hurricane season, power cuts are extremely rare here. So far, for 2020, we have had one outage due to a lightning strike on a nearby electrical post.</p>
<p>It takes a minute or so to failover to the backup generator. So the rack mount UPS solution I’m looking for is something that will support between 100W and 200W for a couple of minutes. Long enough to fail over to the backup gen or to shut down all the equipment cleanly. In the future, I may expand this with larger batteries, but with no way of returning anything I purchase, I’m a bit wary of investing in a larger backup battery only to find out it’s a dud. I will test for a year first, and so here’s what I decided on:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/38QM7wi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CyberPower OR500LCDRM1U UPS, 500VA/300W, 6 Outlets, AVR, 1U Rackmount</a> – $220 (<a href="https://www.cyberpowersystems.com/product/ups/smart-app-lcd/or500lcdrm1u/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specs</a>) – A small 1U rackmount UPS coming in at 20lbs, which should give me around 10 to 15 minutes of runtime.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, you will have to decide whether you even require an uninterruptible power supply at home. From experience, UPS batteries are almost always a disappointment, and this is largely because of the cost vs. return. If you really need to have a UPS, you could spend thousands just to have a long enough runtime. If you work from home or host critical services hosted from home – you probably shouldn’t – then it may be worthwhile. My advice, get a UPS that provides just enough runtime for everything to shut down cleanly and only use the UPS for the most essential and efficient devices in your home lab. With all things considered, I’ll have to come back to this section before recommending any other UPS models.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> Surprisingly, the battery performance of this UPS so far is above my expectations. I ran it down to around 50%, which gave me just over 30 mins of run time, including powering<a href="https://amzn.to/2vdi1EO" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 2 PoE APs</a> and a <a href="https://amzn.to/3T8OXnf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">27″ monitor</a>. As mentioned later in this article, pay attention to your power consumption. This was something I considered, and it’s paid off thus far. The APs for example, max power consumption is just 6.5W per AP. The max load is about 20% to 30% of UPS capacity.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Did you notice that the CyberPower 1U UPS does not have rack mounts? Of course, you could rest it on top of other equipment; however, I wouldn’t recommend that because we should keep the batteries as cool as possible and leave space between equipment to reduce the amount of trapped heat. Lastly, for this setup, it will look more professional if placed on a ventilated 1U rack shelf:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2SVmwga" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AC Infinity Vented Cantilever 1U Universal Rack Shelf, 10″ Deep, for 19”</a> – $30 (<a href="https://www.acinfinity.com/rack-accessories/rack-shelves/vented-cantilever-1u-rack-shelf-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specs</a>) – These shelves are available from 6″ to 16″ deep. The backup battery is 9.5″. Pay attention to the depth of your rack/cabinet and equipment before deciding what you need.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> Very sturdy, great for keeping equipment cool and cable management thanks to the vents and slots.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>The aforementioned CyberPower UPS comes with six outlets – four backup /w surge + two surges only. Currently, under my desk, I’m using seven outlets, and this is before ordering a replacement ISP modem, router, switch, servers and does not consider any future expansion. Right above the UPS, I will be mounting the following:</p>

</ul>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> This is a very convenient piece of hardware. It plugs directly into the UPS and allows easy on/off switching of other equipment and devices.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Maintaining an optimal temperature for rack-mounted equipment prevents overheating, ensures consistent performance, and extends their lifespan. The plan is to mount an intake fan at the bottom rack unit position (remember hot air rises). After testing, I will decide whether I’ll need an exhaust fan at the very top of the rack.</p>

At 13.5″ deep it will be either a tight squeeze or will need modification for my rack. So I have not ordered this until I can examine it closer.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> At the lowest fan speed, this cools rack temps by about 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit. I’ll update my thoughts again in the summer.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Update 2:</em></strong> As of September 2022, two of the four fans have failed. I’ve removed it from the rack and will try to clean it with compressed air. Over the past 2 years of use, they are filled with dust! I still recommend buying these units, but I also recommend cleaning them out more often than I have!</p>

Of course, this means that you will still have to research the recommendations on your own, as not all of my picks may fit your requirements.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong>: Just what I needed. The router runs modified Debian. How cool! It’s packed with enterprise features. I’m excited to learn full command line management.&nbsp;</em></p>
<h3><span id="Home_Lab_Patch_Panels_and_Network_Cables"></span>Home Lab Patch Panels and Network Cables<span></span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/16-port-patch-panel-2-868x234.jpg" alt="16 port patch panel" width="868" height="234" srcset="https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/16-port-patch-panel-2.jpg 868w, https://static.linuxblog.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/16-port-patch-panel-2-300x81.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px" loading="lazy" fetchpriority="low"></p>
<p>In hindsight, I should have gone with the <a href="https://amzn.to/2Tflgn9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">24 port patch panel</a>. Instead, I went with <a href="https://amzn.to/2Vh9lYA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this 16 port patch panel</a> because, well, I liked how centered and less busy it looked. I know. I don’t want to hear it. But look at that thing! If it isn’t already obvious by the 16 ports, it’s the image just above.</p>
<p>The fastest internet plan available from my ISP is 160Mbps down / 30Mbps up. For my home lab, I won’t be needing CAT8 or CAT7 anytime soon, and I don’t need high LAN traffic. So I purchased <a href="https://amzn.to/2PldEy5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">250′ of regular CAT6 reel</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://amzn.to/37XehEK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some different lengths Cat6</a> as I’m ok with the 1000Mbps limit. Yeah, I also like my coffee black. If you want smoother network traffic, then, by all means, go for at least <a href="https://blog.tripplite.com/cat6-vs-cat6a-ethernet-cables-everything-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CAT6a</a>. However, make sure you go with a&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/2w07tc3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shielded patch panel</a>. Going CAT7 cable or Cat6a is a waste of money if your RJ45 connectors and patch panels don’t support it. “Keep it simple stupid!” No, I’m not talking to you; that was me speaking to myself while selecting the patch panel and cables.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> High quality! Easy to punch down. All my patch connections worked on the first try.</em></p>

<p>For this article’s purpose, I won’t recommend any specific servers because this will vary a ton depending on what you will be hosting. NAS storage, VMs, web servers, backup servers, mail servers, ad blockers, and all the rest. For my requirements, I purchased a <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/desktops/thinkcentre/m-series-tiny/m73/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ThinkCentre M73</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/desktops-and-all-in-ones/thinkcentre/m-series-tiny/ThinkCentre-M715q-Tiny/p/11TC1MT715Q">ThinkCentre&nbsp;M715q</a>; both&nbsp;used off eBay. As far as full-fledged servers go, some good options are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/servers/cp/servers-storage-networking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dell</a>, <a href="https://www.hpe.com/us/en/servers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HP,</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/servers-unified-computing/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cisco</a>,&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/data-center/servers/c/servers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lenovo</a>. For home labs, these are often best purchased <em>used</em> from Craigslist or eBay. You can use Wikipedia to search the specs of older generations, for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dell_PowerEdge_Servers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dell PowerEdge model history</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong> AMD has raised the bar. I’m most impressed with the CPU performance of the M715q. They both run quiet and cool, with Ubuntu Server and Windows 10.&nbsp;</em></p>

<em><a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/i8YdrnU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Image</a>: your setup, should be your setup. As traditional or as custom as you’d like!</em></p>
<p>When writing this guide, I tried my best to convey my passion, thoughts, and considerations throughout the selection process. It’s important that you find your passion when it comes to building your home lab. What will you use it for? How will it benefit you and others?</p>
<p>If you have a plan, and if your lab will be something you enjoy learning, failing, and succeeding with, it will pay for itself in one way or another. That said, be careful with the power consumption! You don’t want to end up with… <em>mortgage of $1,100, a power bill of $1,200, the feeling when walking into your home lab… NOT priceless.</em></p>
<p>Plan with room to expand, and feel free to start small. You don’t have to start with a rack, cabinet, patch panels, and all the other gear. Get your feet wet, replace your ISP modem, then build from there. Avoid making rash decisions on hardware; instead, sleep on it. Then, post a question or two in the <strong><a href="https://linuxcommunity.io/t/how-to-build-a-homelab/49" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new community forums</a></strong>,&nbsp;to get valuable feedback from other techies and sysadmins. You will find that the more you research, it will open up additional ways to get things just right or very wrong. More importantly, have fun! Share your home lab goals with your spouse, colleagues, kids, and that neighbor across the street who still only waves after five years.</p>

<p><strong><em>Update 1 – March 10th, 2020:</em> </strong></p>
<p>As of today, I’ve almost completed the setup of my new Home lab, and it’s now fully functional. I’m pleased with all of the items purchased. For this update, I’ve added to the article some highlights, tips, and findings below each hardware item in <em>italics</em>.</p>
<p>One thing I missed in the original article and Home lab setup was the coaxial cable. The existing cable turned out to be about three feet shorter than required. Tomorrow, I’ll replace it with a longer cable. As you can see, I’ve also replaced the ISP modem with the Motorola model listed below.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the <a href="https://www.ui.com/products/#edgemax" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubiquiti EdgeRouter and EdgeSwitch</a> turned out to be about an inch too wide. I failed to consider this because I measured their combined width and then compared that measurement to the rack’s interior width instead of the width of the rack shelf. Oops! Now, so that the switch doesn’t remain sitting on the router, I’ve just ordered two <a href="https://amzn.to/2PZPFVu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubiquiti rack mounts</a>. Better cooling and aesthetics, but also the rack mounts will allow positioning the router and switch directly below the 16 port patch panel pictured below.&nbsp; Check back in a week or two for another update.</p>

<p><em><strong>Update – August 19th, 2021:</strong></em></p>
<p>A month ago a friend asked if I could set up something similar for their home. They wanted a simple whole-home VPN setup. Pictured below is the result. All together uses less than 40 watts via a 700VA UPS.</p>

<p><em><strong>Update – October 7th, 2022:&nbsp;</strong>Added update on the AC Infinity CLOUDPLATE T7-N, Rack Mount Fan Panel 2U (Intake). Make sure to clean the dust from these units every couple of months. It took 2 years without any maintenance for 2 of the 4 fans to become disabled. I will update if they work again once cleaned.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Update – December 13th, 2022:<br>
</strong></em><em>We moved to a new home in February. So I removed the home lab – cables and all. Finally had the time to set up. I’ve made very small changes because I really like it as is.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Changes:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em> Mounted at a more ergonomic height.<br>
</em></li>
<li><em>Flipped some devices around (for easier access to unplugging/power buttons)</em></li>
<li><em>Replaced the EdgeRouter with a new <a href="https://www.peplink.com/products/balance-20x/">Peplink Balance 20x</a> for ISP <a href="https://www.peplink.com/technology/load-balancing-algorithms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">load balanced using the “fastest response” method</a>.</em></li>

<p><em><strong>Update: May 3rd, 2023:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em> Purchased a <a href="https://amzn.to/44lKNPd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1500VA Cyberpower UPS</a> and o</em><em>ffloaded 3 PC monitors and a gaming PC. So that the in-rack 1u UPS only connected to the servers and network devices. This allows for up to 3 hours of runtime on battery if needed.&nbsp;</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Update: Sept 24th, 2023:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Added information above on failure of the <span id="productTitle">AC Infinity CLOUDPLATE T7-N, Rack Mount intake</span> fans.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em>Added a link to my <a href="https://linuxblog.io/peplink-balance-20x-router-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peplink Balance 20x Router Review</a>.</em></li>

We demonstrate here that a proper analysis by the original statistical method should have found a lower NOAEL (0.014 mg/kg-day), and that use of statistical methods first available in 1982 would have shown that even the lowest dose in the study had a significant treatment effect,” the researchers report.</p><p id="industry_studies">Furthermore, they wrote, “The original analysis, conducted by Dow-employed statisticians, did not undergo formal peer review; nevertheless, EPA cited the Coulston study as credible research and kept its reported NOAEL as a point of departure for risk assessments throughout much of the 1980′s and 1990′s. During that period, EPA allowed chlorpyrifos to be registered for multiple residential uses that were later cancelled to reduce potential health impacts to children and infants. Had appropriate analyses been employed in the evaluation of this study, it is likely that many of those registered uses of chlorpyrifos would not have been authorized by EPA.

It is known to pass easily from mother to fetus and has been linked to a wide range of serious medical problems, including impaired development, Parkinson’s disease and some forms of cancer. That’s not entirely surprising. The chemical wasoriginally developedby Nazis during World War II for use as a nerve gas.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://lisyarus.github.io/blog/programming/2023/02/21/exponential-smoothing.html">https://lisyarus.github.io/blog/programming/2023/02/21/exponential-smoothing.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39637487">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    



<p>There’s a certain simple animation thing that I’ve been using almost since I’ve ever started doing anything related to graphics. I use it for rotating &amp; moving the camera, for moving figures in a turn-based game, for moving UI elements, for smoothing volume changes in <a href="https://lisyarus.github.io/blog/programming/2022/10/15/audio-mixing.html">my audio lib</a>, everywhere! So I decided I’ll write about it. The trick itself is nothing new, - in fact, you’ve probably already heard about or even used it, - but I’ll also show it in some examples and explain how it works mathematically :)</p>

<h2 id="toggle-buttons">Toggle buttons</h2>

<p>Speaking of UI, say you’re making some UI component, maybe a toggle button. Something like this (click it!):</p>

<center><canvas id="toggle-none"></canvas></center>




<p>This simply computes the position of the switch as a function of its state:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>turned_on</span> <span>?</span> <span>max_x</span> <span>:</span> <span>min_x</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This works perfectly, but feels a bit lifeless. Adding some <em>animation</em> to it would be cool! Animations are not just a fancy visual thing, they help the user understand what’s going on. Instead of teleporting the toggle indicator to its new position, let’s move it smoothly:</p>

<center><canvas id="toggle-linear"></canvas></center>




<p>The downside is that we need to run some updating animation now:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>+=</span> <span>(</span><span>turned_on</span> <span>?</span> <span>1</span> <span>:</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>dt</span><span>;</span>
<span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>clamp</span><span>(</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>min_x</span><span>,</span> <span>max_x</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>However, this still looks a bit clumsy due to having a constant speed (i.e. the position is a <em>linear</em> function of time). Let’s add some <a href="https://easings.net/">easing</a> function on top of that, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothstep">classic cubic</a> <code>3t^2-2t^3</code>:</p>

<center><canvas id="toggle-cubic"></canvas></center>




<p>or a square root <code>sqrt(t)</code>:</p>

<center><canvas id="toggle-sqrt"></canvas></center>




<p>The difference between these may be hard to see, so let’s slow down the animation by a factor of 8:</p>

<center>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td><p>Linear:     </p></td><td><center><canvas id="toggle-compare1-linear"></canvas></center></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>Cubic:      </p></td><td><center><canvas id="toggle-compare1-cubic"></canvas></center></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>Square root:</p></td><td><center><canvas id="toggle-compare1-sqrt"></canvas></center></td><td></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>




<p>This time, instead of just updating the switch position, we have to keep track of some extra animation state:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>t</span> <span>+=</span> <span>(</span><span>turned_on</span> <span>?</span> <span>1</span> <span>:</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>dt</span><span>;</span>
<span>t</span> <span>=</span> <span>clamp</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>ease</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>3</span> <span>*</span> <span>t</span> <span>*</span> <span>t</span> <span>-</span> <span>2</span> <span>*</span> <span>t</span> <span>*</span> <span>t</span> <span>*</span> <span>t</span><span>);</span>
<span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>lerp</span><span>(</span><span>min_x</span><span>,</span> <span>max_x</span><span>,</span> <span>ease</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Here, I’m using the fact that <code>smoothstep</code> is symmetric in the following sense: <code>1 - f(t) = f(1 - t)</code>, meaning the forward and backward animations can use the same code. With <code>sqrt</code> things are a bit different: we have to explicitly use a different easing function depending on the animation’s direction:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>ease</span> <span>=</span> <span>turned_on</span> <span>?</span> <span>sqrt</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>-</span> <span>sqrt</span><span>(</span><span>1</span> <span>-</span> <span>t</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Whichever looks best is arguably a matter of taste, but of all these <code>sqrt</code> is my favourite: the switch starts moving really fast (this is because <code>sqrt</code> has infinite derivative at zero), but then slows down nicely as it reaches the destination (the cubic one is my second favourite, though). The downside of this version is that we need quite a lot of bookkeeping even in the simplest possible case of a two-state toggle button (later in the article I’ll show how this becomes a nightmare in more complicated scenarios). Another downside is that it has a discontinuity: it jumps suddenly if the user clicks on it the middle of animation (try it!).</p>

<p>Thankfully there’s a similar version which uses the minimal possible state and doesn’t have the “jumping” problem:</p>

<center><canvas id="toggle-exp"></canvas></center>




<p>I call it <em>exponential smoothing</em> (for reasons that will become clear later). I’ve also heard it being called <em>approach</em>, and I’m certain it has it’s own name in every engine. Here it is slowed down 8x and compared to <code>sqrt</code>:</p>

<center>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td><p>Square root:</p></td><td><center><canvas id="toggle-compare2-sqrt"></canvas></center></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>Exponential:</p></td><td><center><canvas id="toggle-compare2-exp"></canvas></center></td><td></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>




<p>Here’s the code for the exponential version:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>target</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>state</span><span>.</span><span>value</span> <span>?</span> <span>max_x</span> <span>:</span> <span>min_x</span><span>);</span>
<span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>+=</span> <span>(</span><span>target</span> <span>-</span> <span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span> <span>-</span> <span>exp</span><span>(</span><span>-</span> <span>dt</span> <span>*</span> <span>speed</span><span>));</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Intuitively, on each frame we nudge the current position towards its <em>target position</em> (which is determind by the on/off state). However, the amount of nudging <code>(1 - exp(- dt * speed))</code> looks really weird, doesn’t it? Before we see where it comes from, let’s have a look at some more complicated animations.</p>

<h2 id="camera-movement">Camera movement</h2>

<p>Say we have some kind of map, and a camera scrolling/moving around.</p>

<center><canvas id="camera-none"></canvas></center>




<p><em>Yes I’ve made a whole procedural map generator &amp; renderer just for this example, and I have zero regrets.</em></p>

<p>Again, this begs us to add some animation. Let’s interpolate it with constant speed:</p>

<center><canvas id="camera-linear-jitter"></canvas></center>




<p>Here’s the code:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>+=</span> <span>sign</span><span>(</span><span>target</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>-</span> <span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>dt</span><span>;</span>
<span>position</span><span>.</span><span>y</span> <span>+=</span> <span>sign</span><span>(</span><span>target</span><span>.</span><span>y</span> <span>-</span> <span>position</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>dt</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>See this jittering after the animation completes? That’s because <code>target.x - position.x</code> keeps alternating between being positive and negative. Instead of <code>sign(delta)</code> we need some function that clamps the delta:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>float</span> <span>update</span><span>(</span><span>float</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>value</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span> <span>target</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span> <span>max_delta</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>float</span> <span>delta</span> <span>=</span> <span>target</span> <span>-</span> <span>value</span><span>;</span>
    <span>delta</span> <span>=</span> <span>min</span><span>(</span><span>delta</span><span>,</span>  <span>max_delta</span><span>);</span>
    <span>delta</span> <span>=</span> <span>max</span><span>(</span><span>delta</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>max_delta</span><span>);</span>
    <span>value</span> <span>+=</span> <span>delta</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>update</span><span>(</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>target</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>dt</span><span>);</span>
<span>update</span><span>(</span><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>,</span> <span>target</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>,</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>dt</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Quite a mouthful for such a simple thing! And here’s the result:</p>

<center><canvas id="camera-linear"></canvas></center>




<p>Much better, although it’s still a bit clumsy and also weird if we move the camera faster than the animation completes. We could, as before, add some easing function, like the cubic one:</p>

<center><canvas id="camera-cubic"></canvas></center>




<p>although this time it gets really complicated: we have to maintain a queue of requested movement events, and animate them one by one (otherwise I have no idea how to slap the easing function here). This still looks a bit weird when moving the camera fast enough. We could just ignore user’s input while the animation is active, but this is a deadly sin as it is infuriatingly frustrating from the user’s perspective.</p>

<p>The perfect solution? Why, exponential smoothing of course! The code barely changes compared to the toggle button example:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>+=</span> <span>(</span><span>target</span><span>.</span><span>x</span> <span>-</span> <span>position</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>1.0</span> <span>-</span> <span>exp</span><span>(</span><span>-</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>dt</span><span>));</span>
<span>position</span><span>.</span><span>y</span> <span>+=</span> <span>(</span><span>target</span><span>.</span><span>y</span> <span>-</span> <span>position</span><span>.</span><span>y</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>1.0</span> <span>-</span> <span>exp</span><span>(</span><span>-</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>dt</span><span>));</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>and here’s how it looks like:</p>

<center><canvas id="camera-exp"></canvas></center>




<p>Pretty nice, if you ask me! Notice how it speeds up naturally if you click fast enough.</p>

<h2 id="under-the-hood">Under the hood</h2>

<p>Ok, so what’s up with this <code>1 - exp(- speed * dt)</code>, what on Earth is that?</p>

<p>Let’s start with a simplified version: we have some animation, it has a current <code>position</code> and the new position <code>target</code> which it must move towards with some <code>speed</code>. To make the movement faster when the difference between <code>position</code> and <code>target</code> is large, we make the speed proportional to this difference:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>position</span> <span>+=</span> <span>(</span><span>target</span> <span>-</span> <span>position</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>dt</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Notice how it doesn’t require maintaining <em>any</em> state other than the current and the target position! (<code>speed</code> is usually a constant.) It even doesn’t need to keep track of time that elapsed since the start of the animation, and it adjusts automatically if the <code>target</code> suddenly changes.</p>

<p>Now this already works perfectly in many situations, but there’s a small catch. Here’s the toggle button again, with the above udpate code:</p>

<center><canvas id="toggle-exp-bad"></canvas></center>




<p>See the jittering? That’s because I’ve set the <code>speed</code> value so high that <code>speed * dt</code> became larger than 1! Specifically, I used <code>speed = 220</code> and <code>dt = 1 / 125</code>.</p>

<p>To understand what’s happening, it is useful to rewrite the code above using <code>lerp</code>:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>position</span> <span>=</span> <span>lerp</span><span>(</span><span>position</span><span>,</span> <span>target</span><span>,</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>dt</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You can check that this is ultimately the same formula. We can clearly see what’s going on: the formula interpolates between the current value and the target value. The closer the interpolation parameter <code>speed * dt</code> to zero, the slower the interpolation. The closer it is to one, the faster the movement.</p>

<p>Now, what happens when <code>speed * dt</code> is larger than 1 is that the interpolation <em>overshoots</em>! The only reason it still works is that <code>speed * dt</code> is less than 2, so that the <em>absolute</em> delta between <code>position</code> and <code>target</code> still decreases with time. Here’s an example with <code>speed * dt = 248 / 125 &lt; 2</code>:</p>

<center><canvas id="toggle-exp-bad2"></canvas></center>




<p>and here’s one with <code>speed * dt = 252 / 125 &gt; 2</code>:</p>

<center><canvas id="toggle-exp-bad3"></canvas></center>




<p>The last one doesn’t do anything useful at all.</p>

<p>To solve this, we could simply clamp the value by 1:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>position</span> <span>=</span> <span>lerp</span><span>(</span><span>position</span><span>,</span> <span>target</span><span>,</span> <span>min</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>speed</span> <span>*</span> <span>dt</span><span>));</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>However, this doesn’t seem like the right thing to do in all scenarios. Consider why <code>speed * dt</code> might actually happen to be so large?</p>

<p>One reason is that your <code>speed</code> value is too large because you want a really quick animation. However, as we’ve seen with the above toggle buttons, this is actually way too quick for any reasonable user – the actual animation is impossible to notice. So, out <code>speed</code> value is usually not that high.</p>

<p>The other reason is that <code>dt</code> is too large. Maybe because your code runs too slow, and your framerate is dropping. Maybe because the user moved to a different tab/window and your code was sleeping, and now it got woken up with a <code>dt</code> of many seconds.</p>

<p>When applying such a <code>dt</code> to something like physics, you certainly want to clamp it, or subdivide into several updates, etc. With animations, however, wouldn’t it be cool if everything worked perfectly even in this case? Even if your physics might lag, at least the camera &amp; buttons would still work nicely – as a user, I would really appreciate such care.</p>

<h2 id="differential-equations-oh-no">Differential equations (oh no)</h2>

<p>Ok, we want to solve the problem, but how? Here’s the two-step recipe:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Realize that what we’re doing is numerically solving a certain differential equation</li>
  <li>Solve the equation symbolically and use the result directly</li>
</ol>

<p>Time-dependent update that works for small <code>dt</code> but breaks for large <code>dt</code> is pretty typical for numerical solvers of differential equations. What equation does <code>position += (target - position) * speed * dt</code> solve? Whenever you see <code>A += B * dt</code>, this corresponds to an equation</p>

<center><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\small%20\dpi{200}\frac{d}{dt}A=B"></center>

<p>In our case, the equation is</p>

<center><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\small%20\dpi{200}\frac{d}{dt}\text{position}%20=%20(\text{target%20-%20position})\cdot\text{speed}"></center>


<p>I will die if I keep typing these formulas with all words spelled out, so let’s make a few variable changes: call <code>x = position</code>, <code>a = target</code>, and <code>c = speed</code>:</p>

<center><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\small%20\dpi{200}\frac{d}{dt}x%20=%20(a%20-%20x)%20\cdot%20c"></center>


<p>Solving this needs just a few tricks:</p>

<center><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\small%20\dpi{200}\frac{d}{dt}(x%20-%20a)%20=%20\frac{d}{dt}x%20=%20(a%20-%20x)%20\cdot%20c%20=%20-%20(x%20-%20a)%20\cdot%20c"></center>

<center><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\small%20\dpi{200}x%20-%20a%20=%20(x_0%20-%20a)\cdot%20\exp(-c\cdot%20t)"></center>

<center><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\small%20\dpi{200}x%20=%20a%20-%20(a%20-%20x_0)\cdot%20\exp(-c\cdot%20t)"></center>

<center><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\small%20\dpi{200}x%20=%20x_0%20+%20(a%20-%20x_0)\cdot%20(1%20-%20\exp(-c\cdot%20t)%20)"></center>


<p><em>Btw, a similar exponent appears in e.g. volumetric rendering for pretty similar reasons.</em></p>

<p>It’s not important to understand exactly where this all comes from. The point is that if we believe that <code>position += (target - position) * speed * dt</code> is the right formula for <em>small</em> <code>dt</code>, then the formula <code>position += (target - position) * (1 - exp(- speed * dt))</code> is the right formula to use for <em>any</em> <code>dt</code>. This is further supported by expanding the latter equation in terms of Taylor series for the exponent: <code>exp(x) ~ 1 + x</code>, so that <code>1 - exp(- speed * dt) ~ 1 - (1 - speed * dt) = speed * dt</code>, i.e. we get exactly the former equation.</p>

<p>The cool thing is that it doesn’t care about old values: if you have your previous value <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\small%20\dpi{100}x_0"> and you know how much time has passed between the previous and the current iteration, you can compute the new value. (This is a direct consequence of being a first-order differential equation.)</p>

<p>So, the TL;DR is that <code>position += (target - position) * (1 - exp(- speed * dt))</code>  is the right formula that works for any <code>speed</code> and <code>dt</code>. Even if the product <code>speed * dt</code> is too large, <code>exp(- speed * dt)</code> handles it nicely, since <code>exp</code> of a large negative number is just something close to zero, so <code>1 - exp</code> will be close to one.</p>

<p>We can, as before, rewrite this using <code>lerp</code>: <code>position = lerp(position, target, 1 - exp(- speed * dt))</code> or even <code>position = lerp(target, position, exp(- speed * dt))</code>. There are many ways to rewrite this equtaion.</p>

<h2 id="choosing-the-speed">Choosing the speed</h2>

<p>Usually, we think of animation in terms of its <em>duration</em>. Like, the toggle button should move to the new place in 0.125 seconds (the actual value used in the examples in the beginning of the post), after that it stops moving. With this exponential formula, however, the animation technically takes <em>infinite</em> time to complete! <code>exp(- speed * time)</code> gets smaller with time, but it <em>never</em> equals zero, so that <code>position</code> technically <em>never</em> equals <code>target</code> (provided they were different to start with).</p>

<p>However, in practice we have a ton of limitations. If <code>position</code> is floating-point, it quickly reaches the precision limit, and it becomes equal to <code>target</code> in practice. If it is, say, the camera position, the user probably won’t notice that the animation is still going since the delta <code>target - position</code> gets ridiculously small even before it hits floating-point precision limits.</p>

<p>So, what does the <code>speed</code> parameter mean, exactly? It means the following: <code>1 / speed</code> is the time in which <code>position</code> becomes closer to <code>target</code> by a factor of <code>e = 2.71828...</code> exactly. Do whatever you want with this information.</p>

<p>I usually set the <code>speed</code> to something in the range <code>5..50</code>. For a linear/cubic animation of a certain <code>speed</code>, I usually set the exponential version speed to be <code>2 * speed</code>, this feels about right (again, this is what was used in the examples above).</p>



<p>If you google “exponential smoothing” (or “exponential moving average”), you might find the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing">wiki article</a> on something completely unrelated which, nevertheless, features some pretty similar formulas. It actually is the discrete analogue of what we were talking about in this post!</p>

<p>Suppose that our <code>dt</code> is always the same; also suppose that <code>target</code> changes as often as every iteration. Then, indexing the values with the iteration number, we compute something like <code>position[i] = (target[i] - position[i - 1]) * factor</code>, where <code>factor = 1 - exp(- speed * dt)</code>. In this case, one typically sets <code>factor</code> directly to some value between 0 and 1 instead of deriving it from other values (although the aforementioned wiki article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing#Time_constant">does explain</a> what this <code>factor</code> actually means).</p>

<p>People use it in signal processing for the same reasons I do for animations: it doesn’t require maintaining previous values or any other obscure state, just the current averaged value. They also use it in digital audio, where you typically have a fixed <code>dt</code> of <code>1 / freq</code> the inverse sampling frequency (e.g. <code>1/44100</code> or <code>1/48000</code>).</p>

</div><p>The European Space Agency (ESA) Space Debris and Independent Safety Offices are closely monitoring the reentry of a pallet of used ISS batteries and calculating estimates for when and where the reentry will occur.</p><div>

While some parts may reach the ground, the casualty risk – the likelihood of a person being hit – is very low.</p><p>The reentry will occur between -51.6 degrees South and 51.6 degrees North. Large uncertainties, primarily driven by fluctuating levels of atmospheric drag, prevent more precise predictions at this time. The closer we get to the expected reentry window, the better the concerned region can be geographically constrained.</p>	</div><div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
  <p>
    annas-blog.org, 2022-10-17 (translations: <a href="https://saveweb.othing.xyz/blog/2022/11/12/%e5%a6%82%e4%bd%95%e6%88%90%e4%b8%ba%e6%b5%b7%e7%9b%97%e6%a1%a3%e6%a1%88%e5%ad%98%e6%a1%a3%e8%80%85/">中文 [zh]</a>)
  </p>
  <p>
    Before we dive in, two updates on the Pirate Library Mirror (EDIT: moved to Anna’s Archive):<br>
    1. We got some extremely generous donations. The first was $10k from the anonymous individual who also has been supporting "bookwarrior", the original founder of Library Genesis. Special thanks to bookwarrior for facilitating this donation. The second was another $10k from an anonymous donor, who got in touch after our last release, and was inspired to help. We also had a number of smaller donations. Thanks so much for all your generous support. We have some exciting new projects in the pipeline which this will support, so stay tuned.<br>
    2. We had some technical difficulties with the size of our second release, but our torrents are up and seeding now. We also got a generous offer from an anonymous individual to seed our collection on their very-high-speed servers, so we're doing a special upload to their machines, after which everyone else who is downloading the collection should see a large improvement in speed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Entire books can be written about the <em>why</em> of digital preservation in general, and pirate archivism in particular, but let us give a quick primer for those who are not too familiar. The world is producing more knowledge and culture than ever before, but also more of it is being lost than ever before. Humanity largely entrusts corporations like academic publishers, streaming services, and social media companies with this heritage, and they have often not proven to be great stewards. Check out the documentary Digital Amnesia, or really any talk by Jason Scott.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are some institutions that do a good job archiving as much as they can, but they are bound by the law. As pirates, we are in a unique position to archive collections that they cannot touch, because of copyright enforcement or other restrictions. We can also mirror collections many times over, across the world, thereby increasing the chances of proper preservation.
  </p>
  <p>
    For now, we won't get into discussions about the pros and cons of intellectual property, the morality of breaking the law, musings on censorship, or the issue of access to knowledge and culture. With all that out of the way, let's dive into the <em>how</em>. We'll share how our team became pirate archivists, and the lessons that we learned along the way. There are many challenges when you embark on this journey, and hopefully we can help you through some of them.
  </p>
  <p><img src="https://annas-blog.org/party-guy.png"></p><h2>Community</h2>
  <p>
    The first challenge might be a surprising one. It is not a technical problem, or a legal problem. It is a psychological problem: doing this work in the shadows can be incredibly lonely. Depending on what you're planning to do, and your threat model, you might have to be very careful. On the one end of the spectrum we have people like Alexandra Elbakyan*, the founder of Sci-Hub, who is very open about her activities. But she is at high risk of being arrested if she would visit a western country at this point, and could face decades of prison time. Is that a risk you would be willing to take? We are at the other end of the spectrum; being very careful not to leave any trace, and having strong operational security.
  </p>
  <p>
    * As mentioned on HN by "ynno", Alexandra initially didn't want to be known: "Her servers were set up to emit detailed error messages from PHP, including full path of faulting source file, which was under directory /home/ringo-ring, which could be traced to a username she had online on an unrelated site, attached to her real name. Before this revelation, she was anonymous." So, use random usernames on the computers you use for this stuff, in case you misconfigure something.
  </p>
  <p>
    That secrecy, however, comes with a psychological cost. Most people love being recognized for the work that they do, and yet you cannot take any credit for this in real life. Even simple things can be challenging, like friends asking you what you have been up to (at some point "messing with my NAS / homelab" gets old).
  </p>
  <p>
    This is why it is so important to find some community. You can give up some operational security by confiding in some very close friends, who you know you can trust deeply. Even then be careful not to put anything in writing, in case they have to turn over their emails to the authorities, or if their devices are compromised in some other manner.
  </p>
  <p>
    Better still is to find some fellow pirates. If your close friends are interested in joining you, great! Otherwise, you might be able to find others online. Sadly this is still a niche community. So far we have found only a handful of others who are active in this space. Good starting places seem to be the Library Genesis forums, and r/DataHoarder. The Archive Team also has likeminded individuals, though they operate within the law (even if in some grey areas of the law). The traditional "warez" and pirating scenes also have folks who think in similar ways.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are open to ideas on how to foster community and explore ideas. Feel free to message us on Twitter or Reddit. Perhaps we could host some sort of forum or chat group. One challenge is that this can easily get censored when using common platforms, so we would have to host it ourselves. There is also a tradeoff between having these discussions fully public (more potential engagement) versus making it private (not letting potential "targets" know that we're about to scrape them). We'll have to think about that. Let us know if you are interested in this!
  </p>
  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <p>
    When we do a project, it has a couple of phases:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Domain selection / philosophy: Where do you roughly want to focus on, and why? What are your unique passions, skills, and circumstances that you can use to your benefit?</li>
    <li>Target selection: Which specific collection will you mirror?</li>
    <li>Metadata scraping: Cataloging information about the files, without actually downloading the (often much larger) files themselves.</li>
    <li>Data selection: Based on the metadata, narrowing down which data is most relevant to archive right now. Could be everything, but often there is a reasonable way to save space and bandwidth.</li>
    <li>Data scraping: Actually getting the data.</li>
    <li>Distribution: Packaging it up in torrents, announcing it somewhere, getting people to spread it.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    These are not completely independent phases, and often insights from a later phase send you back to an earlier phase. For example, during metadata scraping you might realize that the target that you selected has defensive mechanisms beyond your skill level (like IP blocks), so you go back and find a different target.
  </p>
  <h3>1. Domain selection / philosophy</h3>
  <p>
    There is no shortage of knowledge and cultural heritage to be saved, which can be overwhelming. That's why it's often useful to take a moment and think about what your contribution can be.
  </p>
  <p>
    Everyone has a different way of thinking about this, but here are some questions that you could ask yourself:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Why are you interested in this? What are you passionate about? If we can get a bunch of people who all archive the kinds of things that they specifically care about, that would cover a lot! You will know a lot more than the average person about your passion, like what is important data to save, what are the best collections and online communities, and so on.</li>
    <li>What skills do you have that you can use to your benefit? For example, if you are an online security expert, you can find ways of defeating IP blocks for secure targets. If you are great at organizing communities, then perhaps you can rally some people together around a goal. It is useful to know some programming though, if only for keeping good operational security throughout this process.</li>
    <li>How much time do you have for this? Our advice would be to start small and doing bigger projects as you get the hang of it, but it can get all-consuming.</li>
    <li>What would be a high-leverage area to focus on? If you're going to spend X hours on pirate archiving, then how can you get the biggest "bang for your buck"?</li>
    <li>What are unique ways that you are thinking about this? You might have some interesting ideas or approaches that others might have missed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In our case, we cared in particular about the long term preservation of science. We knew about Library Genesis, and how it was fully mirrored many times over using torrents. We loved that idea. Then one day, one of us tried to find some scientific textbooks on Library Genesis, but couldn't find them, bringing into doubt how complete it really was. We then searched those textbooks online, and found them in other places, which planted the seed for our project. Even before we knew about the Z-Library, we had the idea of not trying to collect all those books manually, but to focus on mirroring existing collections, and contributing them back to Library Genesis.
  </p>
  <h3>2. Target selection</h3>
  <p>
    So, we have our area that we are looking at, now which specific collection do we mirror? There are a couple of things that make for a good target:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Large</li>
    <li>Unique: not already well-covered by other projects.</li>
    <li>Accessible: does not use tons of layers of protection to prevent you from scraping their metadata and data.</li>
    <li>Special insight: you have some special information about this target, like you somehow have special access to this collection, or you figured out how to defeat their defenses. This is not required (our upcoming project does not do anything special), but it certainly helps!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    When we found our science textbooks on websites other than Library Genesis, we tried to figure out how they made their way onto the internet. We then found the Z-Library, and realized that while most books don't first make their appearance there, they do eventually end up there. We learned about its relationship to Library Genesis, and the (financial) incentive structure and superior user interface, both of which made it a much more complete collection. We then did some preliminary metadata and data scraping, and realized that we could get around their IP download limits, leveraging one of our members' special access to lots of proxy servers.
  </p>
  <p>
    As you're exploring different targets, it is already important to hide your tracks by using VPNs and throwaway email addresses, which we'll talk about more later.
  </p>
  <h3>3. Metadata scraping</h3>
  <p>
    Let's get a bit more technical here. For actually scraping the metadata from websites, we have kept things pretty simple. We use Python scripts, sometimes curl, and a MySQL database to store the results in. We haven't used any fancy scraping software which can map complex websites, since so far we only needed to scrape one or two kinds of pages by just enumerating through ids and parsing the HTML. If there aren't easily enumerated pages, then you might need a proper crawler that tries to find all pages.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before you start scraping a whole website, try doing it manually for a bit. Go through a few dozen pages yourself, to get a sense for how that works. Sometimes you will already run into IP blocks or other interesting behavior this way. The same goes for data scraping: before getting too deep into this target, make sure you can actually download its data effectively.
  </p>
  <p>
    To get around restrictions, there are a few things you can try. Are there any other IP addresses or servers that host the same data but do not have the same restrictions? Are there any API endpoints that do not have restrictions, while others do? At what rate of downloading does your IP get blocked, and for how long? Or are you not blocked but throttled down? What if you create a user account, how do things change then? Can you use HTTP/2 to keep connections open, and does that increase the rate at which you can request pages? Are there pages that list multiple files at once, and is the information listed there sufficient?
  </p>
  <p>
    Things you probably want to save include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Title</li>
    <li>Filename / location</li>
    <li>ID: can be some internal ID, but IDs like ISBN or DOI are useful too.</li>
    <li>Size: to calculate how much disk space you need.</li>
    <li>Hash (md5, sha1): to confirm that you downloaded the file properly.</li>
    <li>Date added/modified: so you can come back later and download files that you didn't download before (though you can often also use the ID or hash for this).</li>
    <li>Description, category, tags, authors, language, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We typically do this in two stages. First we download the raw HTML files, usually directly into MySQL (to avoid lots of small files, which we talk more about below). Then, in a separate step, we go through those HTML files and parse them into actual MySQL tables. This way you don't have to re-download everything from scratch if you discover a mistake in your parsing code, since you can just reprocess the HTML files with the new code. It's also often easier to parallelize the processing step, thus saving some time (and you can write the processing code while the scraping is running, instead of having to write both steps at once).
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, note that for some targets metadata scraping is all there is. There are some huge metadata collections out there that aren't properly preserved.
  </p>
  <h3>4. Data selection</h3>
  <p>
    Often you can use the metadata to figure out a reasonable subset of data to download. Even if you eventually want to download all the data, it can be useful to prioritize the most important items first, in case you get detected and defences are improved, or because you would need to buy more disks, or simply because something else comes up in your life before you can download everything.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, a collection might have multiple editions of the same underlying resource (like a book or a film), where one is marked as being the best quality. Saving those editions first would make a lot of sense. You might eventually want to save all editions, since in some cases the metadata might be tagged incorrectly, or there might be unknown tradeoffs between editions (for example, the "best edition" might be best in most ways but worse in other ways, like a film having a higher resolution but missing subtitles).
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also search your metadata database to find interesting things. What is the biggest file that is hosted, and why is it so big? What is the smallest file? Are there interesting or unexpected patterns when it comes to certain categories, languages, and so on? Are there duplicate or very similar titles? Are there patterns to when data was added, like one day in which many files were added at once? You can often learn a lot by looking at the dataset in different ways.
  </p>
  <p>
    In our case, we deduplicated Z-Library books against the md5 hashes in Library Genesis, thereby saving a lot of download time and disk space. This is a pretty unique situation though. In most cases there are no comprehensive databases of which files are already properly preserved by fellow pirates. This in itself is a huge opportunity for someone out there. It would be great to have a regularly updated overview of things like music and films that are already widely seeded on torrent websites, and are therefore lower priority to include in pirate mirrors.
  </p>
  <h3>5. Data scraping</h3>
  <p>
    Now you're ready to actually download the data in bulk. As mentioned before, at this point you should already manually have downloaded a bunch of files, to better understand the  behavior and restrictions of the target. However, there will still be surprises in store for you once you actually get to downloading lots of files at once.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our advice here is mainly to keep it simple. Start by just downloading a bunch of files. You can use Python, and then expand to multiple threads. But sometimes even simpler is to generate Bash files directly from the database, and then running multiple of them in multiple terminal windows to scale up. A quick technical trick worth mentioning here is using OUTFILE in MySQL, which you can write anywhere if you disable "secure_file_priv" in mysqld.cnf (and be sure to also disable/override AppArmor if you're on Linux).
  </p>
  <p>
    We store the data on simple hard disks. Start out with whatever you have, and expand slowly. It can be overwhelming to think about storing hundreds of TBs of data. If that is the situation that you're facing, just put out a good subset first, and in your announcement ask for help in storing the rest. If you do want to get more hard drives yourself, then r/DataHoarder has some good resources on getting good deals.
  </p>
  <p>
    Try not to worry too much about fancy filesystems. It is easy to fall into the rabbit hole of setting up things like ZFS. One technical detail to be aware of though, is that many filesystems don't deal well with lots of files. We've found that a simple workaround is to create multiple directories, e.g. for different ID ranges or hash prefixes.
  </p>
  <p>
    After downloading the data, be sure to check the integrity of the files using hashes in the metadata, if available.
  </p>
  <h3>6. Distribution</h3>
  <p>
    You have the data, thereby giving you possession of the world's first pirate mirror of your target (most likely). In many ways the hardest part is over, but the riskiest part is still ahead of you. After all, so far you've been stealth; flying under the radar. All you had to do was using a good VPN throughout, not filling in your personal details in any forms (duh), and perhaps using a special browser session (or even a different computer).
  </p>
  <p>
    Now you have to distribute the data. In our case we first wanted to contribute the books back to Library Genesis, but then quickly discovered the difficulties in that (fiction vs non-fiction sorting). So we decided on distribution using Library Genesis-style torrents. If you have the opportunity to contribute to an existing project, then that could save you a lot of time. However, there are not many well-organized pirate mirrors out there currently.
  </p>
  <p>
     So let's say you decide on distributing torrents yourself. Try to keep those files small, so they are easy to mirror on other websites. You will then have to seed the torrents yourself, while still staying anonymous. You can use a VPN (with or without port forwarding), or pay with tumbled Bitcoins for a Seedbox. If you don't know what some of those terms mean, you'll have a bunch of reading to do, since it's important that you understand the risk tradeoffs here.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can host the torrent files themselves on existing torrent websites. In our case, we chose to actually host a website, since we also wanted to spread our philosophy in a clear way. You can do this yourself in a similar manner (we use Njalla for our domains and hosting, paid for with tumbled Bitcoins), but also feel free to contact us to have us host your torrents. We are looking to build a comprehensive index of pirate mirrors over time, if this idea catches on.
  </p>
  <p>
    As for VPN selection, much has been written about this already, so we'll just repeat the general advice of choosing by reputation. Actual court-tested no-log policies with long track records of protecting privacy is the lowest risk option, in our opinion. Note that even when you do everything right, you can never get to zero risk. For example, when seeding your torrents, a highly motivated nation-state actor can probably look at incoming and outgoing data flows for VPN servers, and deduce who you are. Or you can just simply mess up somehow. We probably already have, and will again. Luckily, nation states don't care <em>that</em> much about piracy.

    One decision to make for each project, is whether to publish it using the same identity as before, or not. If you keep using the same name, then mistakes in operational security from earlier projects could come back to bite you. But publishing under different names means that you don't build a longer lasting reputation. We chose to have strong operational security from the start so we can keep using the same identity, but we won't hesitate to publish under a different name if we mess up or if the circumstances call for it.

    Getting the word out can be tricky. As we said, this is still a niche community. We originally posted on Reddit, but really got traction on Hacker News. For now our recommendation is to post it in a few places and see what happens. And again, contact us. We would love to spread the word of more pirate archivism efforts.

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Hopefully this is helpful for newly starting pirate archivists. We're excited to welcome you to this world, so don't hesitate to reach out. Let's preserve as much of the world's knowledge and culture as we can, and mirror it far and wide.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-id="page-content" data-og-area="article-blocks" id="incArticle"><p>Many of us lament the disappearance of buttons in car interiors, in favor of screens and touch-sensitive controls. For automakers, these physical inputs cost money, so it's no secret why they're largely disappearing. Those of us who appreciate buttons know they're convenient to find just by feel, without averting your attention from the road. <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/tech/39304/why-im-done-pretending-touchscreen-infotainment-isnt-a-stupid-hazardous-fad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">That's an obvious boon to safety</a>, and it seems that in about two years, European evaluators will start treating it as such. For manufacturers to receive the best possible European New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) safety rating from that point on, they'll need to incorporate a minimum of physical inputs for key functions.</p><p>Before we get ahead of ourselves, there's unfortunately nothing in the criteria that stipulates that frequently adjusted controls, like those for the HVAC system or basic media functions, must happen off a touchscreen. Here, Euro NCAP seems primarily concerned with safety-critical functions. As <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/5/24091043/euro-ncap-safety-rating-europe-2026-touchscreen-buttons-dials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge</a></em> quotes from <em>The Times</em> of London, "cars will need to use buttons, dials, or stalks for hazard warning lights, indicators, windscreen wipers, SOS calls, and the horn."</p><p>Fortunately, I can't remember the last time I drove a car that relied upon capacitive inputs for any of those things. It's not the sweeping change most of us would prefer, but it's a start. Of course, <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/tesla-news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tesla</a> is famous for relegating turn signals to touch-sensitive operation, which <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-fans-complain-new-model-3-highland-turn-signal-stalks-2023-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most people seem to hate</a>. If this move makes the world's most popular EV a little easier to operate for those behind the wheel, that'll also make it safer for the rest of us on the road. Personally, I'm OK with that.</p><figure data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"><span data-rawhtml="1">The 2025 Volkswagen GTI's updated interior features hard buttons on the steering wheel. <em>Volkswagen</em></span></figure><p>Now, it's worth mentioning that the Euro NCAP regime is totally voluntary, and not compulsory by law. In that sense, it's sort of like the testing conducted by the <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/full-size-pickup-trucks-are-terrible-at-protecting-rear-passengers-iihs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insurance Institute for Highway Safety</a> here in the U.S. That said, plenty of automakers love to advertise their IIHS marks when they're favorable, especially as the IIHS has much more stringent criteria than our National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, whose regulations are mired in decades-old legislation. And it stands to reason that adjustments made for other regions will likely trickle over to our own, when possible, to avoid duplication of expense. When you've already engineered a turn signal stalk, why ditch it for particular markets? Unless you have <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/tech/41324/teslas-yoke-and-touchscreen-shifter-look-like-a-parking-lot-disaster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a philosophical objection to common sense</a>, that is.</p><p>This step may not fix modern automotive interiors overnight, but it also won't hurt. It happens to mirror many car companies' own initiatives to reintroduce buttons and physical inputs back into their cars, to win back frustrated customers. <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/2025-vw-gti-brings-buttons-gains-20-hp-ditches-the-manual" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Volkswagen is doing it with the new GTI</a> and Golf R, swapping out the annoying Mk8 steering wheel with its fully touch-sensitive controls for one that is all hard keys. Hyundai, too, has <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/hyundai-promises-to-keep-buttons-in-cars-because-touchscreen-controls-are-dangerous" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vowed to fight the good fight</a>. Let's see other major players do the same.</p><p><em>Got tips? Send 'em to tips@thedrive.com</em></p></section></div>]]></description>

<h2 data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Today, we’re releasing Answer.AI’s first project: a fully open source system that, for the first time, can efficiently train a 70b large language model on a regular desktop computer with two or more standard gaming GPUs (RTX 3090 or 4090). This system, which combines FSDP and QLoRA, is the result of a collaboration between Answer.AI, Tim Dettmers (U Washington), and Hugging Face’s Titus von Koeller and Sourab Mangrulkar.</p>
<p>This system will help the open source community release better models. Teknium, the creator of the extremely popular OpenHermes models and datasets, with over half a million downloads, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em>With this capability we can take huge models to new heights locally, and gigantic, hundreds of billions of parameter models are now accessible by small labs.</em>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At Answer.AI we made this our first project because it’s a key foundation of our north star: helping make useful AI available to everyone. Just being able to use <em>other</em> people’s models is not enough. We want everyone to be able to create their <em>own</em> personalized models, so that they are in control of their own AI systems.</p>
</section>
<section id="background">
<h2 data-anchor-id="background">Background</h2>
<section id="the-big-idea">
<h3 data-anchor-id="the-big-idea">The big idea</h3>
<p>There are two very different levels of hardware used to train deep learning models. There is the data center class hardware, such as H100s and A100s, costing <a href="https://shop.lambdalabs.com/deep-learning/servers/blade/customize">hundreds of thousands of dollars</a>. Then there are desktop computers containing gaming GPUs, such as dual 4090s, costing <a href="https://shop.lambdalabs.com/gpu-workstations/vector/customize">under $10,000</a> (and which can be assembled from 2nd hand parts for less than half the price of a pre-built system).</p>
<p>But here’s the key point: the gaming GPUs have similar performance to the data center GPUs that cost over 10x more! It would be great if we could use these 10x cheaper (but nearly as fast) cards to train large language models, but we can’t, because they have much less memory. The best currently available data center cards have 80GB RAM, whilst gaming cards max out at 24GB RAM. Since only the largest models produce the best results, creating the best models has been largely inaccessible to most people.</p>
<p>We realized that there’s actually no intrinsic reason for this. The super fast hardware is there, waiting to be used – we just need a way to feed it with the model and the data in a way that meets its memory constraints. The obvious question is: why hasn’t this been done then? All the big industry labs have the 10x more expensive hardware already, so they don’t really have the incentive to figure this out.</p>
<p>The big idea here is simple: figure out how to use these cheaper, lower-memory gaming GPUs to train the best available open source models. So the goal is this: train<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> a 70 billion parameter (70b) model using only gaming GPUs, which means our per-GPU memory will be at most 24GB. It’ll be a challenge, because each parameter normally takes 16 bits (2 bytes), so that’s 70*2=140GB to even store the weights – and that’s without including all the other data such as activations, gradients, and optimization state!</p>

<section id="why-this-project">
<h3 data-anchor-id="why-this-project">Why this project?</h3>
<p>Answer.AI is a very unusual type of organization – a for-profit R&amp;D lab closer in spirit to <a href="https://www.answer.ai/posts/2024-01-26-freaktakes-lessons.html">19th century electricity labs</a> than to today’s AI research groups. Figuring out how to make large model training inexpensive and accessible is just the kind of thing Eric Ries and Jeremy Howard hoped we’d be able to do when the organization was <a href="https://www.answer.ai/posts/2023-12-12-launch.html">launched at NeurIPS</a> last year.</p>
<p>Solving this problem is hard. It requires understanding many separate libraries (e.g bitsandbytes, PEFT, Transformers, Accelerate, and PyTorch), and computer science and math concepts (e.g discretization, distributed computing, GPU programming, linear algebra, SGD concepts such as gradient checkpointing), and how they all interact.</p>
<p>Academia is full of brilliant people that solve hard problems. But academia hasn’t solved this particular problem. That’s because it’s difficult for university researchers to justify spending time on this kind of work. Combining existing tools and techniques together isn’t generally considered “novel” enough to result in publication in a high impact journal, but that’s the currency that academics need. Furthermore, academics are generally expected to become highly specialized within their field, making it challenging to bring together so many pieces into a single solution.</p>
<p>And, of course, big tech companies are also full of brilliant people that solve hard problems. But this particular problem, training models with consumer GPUs, isn’t a problem they need to solve – they’ve already bought the big expensive GPUs! Many startups are also full of brilliant people that solve hard problems! But, as <a href="https://ltse.com/about/mission">Eric Ries explains</a>, “today’s financial market forces businesses to prioritize short-term gains over everything else”. It’s extremely hard for a startup to justify to investors why they’re spending their funds on open source software and public research.</p>
<p>Whilst academia, big tech, and startups had good reasons for not solving this problem, these are <a href="https://www.answer.ai/posts/2023-12-12-launch.html">the exact reasons</a> that this problem was a great fit for Answer.AI. Everyone who works at the company has built the kinds of systems that we had to work with on this problem, so we were able to understand how all the pieces fit together. People who love to both deeply understand the foundations of software and AI, and also love to hack at fun and interesting end-to-end systems are the kinds of people who are drawn to Answer.AI, and vice versa.</p>
<p>The problems we choose to solve together are selected by the same people that will do the solving. So we tend to pick up projects that involve bringing together multiple ideas together to create practically useful solutions. And because we’re a public benefit company with a charter to produce <em>long term</em> benefit from AI, open source software and public research are directly in line with our mission.</p>

<section id="qlora-train-bigger-models-on-a-single-gpu">
<h3 data-anchor-id="qlora-train-bigger-models-on-a-single-gpu">QLoRA: Train bigger models on a single GPU</h3>
<p>Two projects have been released recently that took the first critical steps towards making this a reality: QLoRA (by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314">Tim Dettmers et al</a>), and FSDP (by Meta’s <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/07/15/open-source/fsdp/">PyTorch team</a>).</p>
<p>QLoRA is a simple but brilliant combination of two critically important advances in modern neural networks: <em>quantization</em>, and <em>LoRA</em>. Quantization is a technique where, instead of using 16 or even 32 bits to store the weights of a neural network, 4 (or even fewer) bits are used. There are only 16 possible values of a 4 bit number, but <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09720">Dettmers and Zettlemoyer showed</a> that this can be enough in the large language models that are popular today. Tim Dettmers made these 4-bit “quantized” models easy to create, thanks to his bitsandbytes library, and recently Hugging Face has stepped in to help <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/bitsandbytes/main/en/index">maintain and document</a> this library, particularly thanks to the initiative of Titus von Koeller.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, once a model is quantized, it can not be trained any further with regular approaches – with just 16 possible values, the gradient descent method used for model training will observe zero gradients nearly everywhere, so it can’t make any updates to the quantized weights. This is a major problem, because it means that quantization can only be used for inference, not for continued pre-training or fine-tuning. Whilst inference is useful and important, it’s really just <em>consuming</em> models. But we want everybody to be able to <em>contribute</em> to <em>creating</em> models!</p>
<p>The trick to avoiding this limitation is to use <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685">LoRA</a> – “Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models”. LoRA doesn’t train the whole large language model at all, but instead adds “adaptors”, which are very small matrices (generally smaller than 1% of the full model) that are trained, whilst keeping the rest of the model constant. If you’ve played with models like Stable Diffusion, you will have probably seen these adapters many times; it’s how those models are generally shared, and why they are so small and fast to download.</p>
<p>Tim realized that LoRA can be combined with quantization: use a quantized base model, which is not changed at all by the training, and add trainable LoRA adaptors that are not quantized. This combination is <em>QLoRA</em>. Tim’s team was able to use this to, for the first time, train a model that (unquantized) is larger than the GPU: they trained a 65b model (which is 130GB unquantized) on a 48GB card.</p>
<p>Hugging Face stepped in once again here, creating the <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/peft">PEFT</a> library, which made LoRA training far simpler, and also integrating it directly with bitsandbytes to allow anyone to use QLoRA with just a few lines of code. The Hugging Face team has been working tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure that the open source community can use these technologies to train their models. If you’ve ever used Transformers to load a 4-bit model using a single function argument, then you’ve got them to thank (and even if you haven’t, you’ve almost certainly used the work of folks that have built their model with this ecosystem).</p>
<p>QLoRA didn’t quite slay the problem we set out to solve, to train a 70b model on 24GB cards, but it got closer than anything before. When quantized to 4 bits (which is 0.5 bytes), the 70b model takes 70/2 = 35 GB, which is larger than the 24GB gaming GPUs we want to use.</p>
<p>There are other limitations to QLoRA. A 48GB card is very expensive, and training a 65b model only just fits on such a card. That can be a problem, because we need to store lots of other things too, including the activations<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, gradients, and optimization state of the model during training. If there’s not much memory left over after loading the model weights, there’s not enough working memory to support training.</p>
<p>For instance, one of the benefits of language models is that we can use them to “chat” with, or understand, or analyze long documents or conversations. To make models that can handle long sequences like that, we need to show them examples of long sequences during training. The longest sequence used in training is called the “sequence length”. Trying to use anything but a short sequence length will cause an error when training a 65b QLoRA model on a 48GB card, because there isn’t enough memory to store all the information about the sequence; nearly all the memory is used just to store the model itself.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the model can only look at a single sequence at a time, it’s going to take a really long time to get through all the data in our training set. So instead we want to be able to “batch” a few sequences together at a time. The number of sequences included is the “batch size”. When there’s very little space left on the GPU after loading the model weights, we can only use very small batch sizes, resulting in extremely slow training.</p>
</section>
<section id="fsdp-scale-training-to-multiple-gpus">
<h3 data-anchor-id="fsdp-scale-training-to-multiple-gpus">FSDP: Scale training to multiple GPUs</h3>
<p>One obvious solution to the problem of the RAM limitations of a single consumer GPU, is to use more than one GPU! A very common approach in the open source community is to simply place a few layers of the model on each card. So then to train, you run the first few layers on the first GPU, then the next few on the second GPU, and so forth. For instance, a 70b (140GB) model could be spread over 8 24GB GPUs, using 17.5GB on each. There’s even a convenient setting in Hugging Face Transformers, <code>device_map=’auto’</code>, which you may well have used; that’s what this is actually doing behind the scenes. This does the job, but there’s a giant downside: only one GPU is ever active at a time, as all the others wait for their “turn”. That means that ⅞ of the compute is wasted.</p>
<p><em>Distributed Data Parallel</em> (DDP) was previously the gold standard approach to training models across multiple GPUs efficiently. This requires keeping the full model on each GPU – if you have a small model (e.g.&nbsp;a 2b model, which takes 4GB RAM) you can simply load the whole thing onto each GPU separately, and have each GPU then churn through training examples in parallel. So for instance, if you had 4 GPUs, that’s a 4x training speedup. But DDP doesn’t work if the model doesn’t fit onto a GPU, with enough room to spare for the data needed for the training process.</p>
<p>So we need something that can split a model across GPUs (like <code>device_map=’auto’</code>) and also use them in parallel (like DPP). This is where Meta’s <a href="https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/FSDP_tutorial.html">Fully Sharded Data Parallel</a> (FSDP) library comes in. It “shards” a large model, by splitting its parameters across multiple GPUs, allowing all the GPUs to be used simultaneously. When a layer of the neural network is calculated on a particular GPU during training, all the required shards are copied there. Then, the calculation is made, and finally the copied parts are deleted from that GPU. Whilst this sounds terribly inefficient, actually by being smart about copying the data of the next layer at the same time the current layer is busy calculating, it’s possible for this approach to result in no slowdown compared to DDP.</p>
<p>FSDP’s ability to bring the performance of DDP to models that are larger than any one GPU has been a revelation. For instance, a 70b (70 billion parameter) unquantized model takes 140GB of RAM (because each parameter is stored as 16 bits, which is 2 bytes), but even NVIDIA’s H100 card (which costs around $40,000 for a single card!) falls short of what’s needed, with its 80GB RAM. But with FSDP, four H100 GPUs can be combined for a total of 320GB RAM.</p>
<p>(Mind you, such a machine is going to set you back around $150,000…)</p>

<h2 data-anchor-id="bringing-fsdp-and-qlora-together">Bringing FSDP and QLoRA together</h2>
<p>At Answer.AI our north star is making useful AI more accessible. $150,000 to create your own high-quality personalized model definitely doesn’t count as accessible! So the first project we embarked on was to make it possible to use a desktop with consumer gaming GPUs to efficiently train a 70b model. We figured that if we could use QLoRA to reduce the size of a model by around 400% (so a 70b model would fit into 35GB RAM), and then we used FSDP to shard that across two or more 24GB consumer cards, that would leave enough RAM left over to train a model.</p>
<section id="first-steps">
<h3 data-anchor-id="first-steps">First steps</h3>
<p>Jeremy and Tim in late 2023 discussed the idea of bringing FSDP and QLoRA together. Tim connected Jeremy with Titus von Koeller, and Jeremy and Titus worked together to try, explore, understand, and document the issues that occurred when the two libraries were combined.</p>
<p>Answer.AI’s Johno Whitaker put together an important first step: a simple standalone test script which allowed us to more deeply understand the problem, and test solutions. A key breakthrough came in early 2024 when Answer.AI’s Benjamin Warner and Titus independently came up with a key idea: store the quantized parameters in a selectable data type, where that storage data type is the same data type as the “computation type” of the model<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Benjamin had this prototyped within 24 hours of developing the idea, but then we discovered another problem: FSDP was not copying the quantization information needed for each shard to use the model! That’s because FSDP is quite opinionated on the subset of data it will sync between GPUs<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. We realized that if we quantized the model on each GPU the missing metadata would remain untouched on all GPUs. Furthermore, we had to move the “quantization state” (the information necessary to (de)quantize the parameters) from the parameters into the layers, in order to ensure they were not removed when FSDP moved shards.</p>
<p>Once we had those issues resolved, we were able to successfully train our first batch of data with a quantized model using FSDP! Benjamin and Answer.AI’s Kerem Tugutlu were able to package this up with all the tests and refactoring needed into a <a href="https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes/pull/970">pull request</a> for bitsandbytes. We’re extremely grateful to the maintainers of the bitsandbytes project, who were very responsive in shepherding our PR through their processes.</p>
</section>
<section id="mission-accomplished-nearly">
<h3 data-anchor-id="mission-accomplished-nearly">Mission accomplished, nearly</h3>
<p>At this point, we once again figured that we’d have things tied up pretty quickly, and once again we under-estimated the complexity of the task! The first thing we realized was that it still wasn’t actually possible to load a quantized model that’s larger than a single GPU, since the loading and quantization process itself required the whole model to be put on one GPU.</p>
<p>Jeremy had spent a few weeks carefully studying Meta’s fantastic <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama-recipes">Llama-Recipes</a> project, which was the best complete FSDP fine tuning implementation he had found, and by closely tracking how it worked together with bitsandbytes, along with Hugging Face’s PEFT, Transformers, and Accelerate projects, he managed to construct a minimal standalone script which manually complete all the steps needed to fine tune a model.</p>
<p>Benjamin realized that with some tweaks it would be possible to do the loading and discretization one layer at a time, thus avoiding the need to ever have the whole model on a single GPU. He also figured out how to prevent the PEFT library from moving the quantization state to CPU. Kerem wrote a custom implementation of the LoRA algorithm so that it could work with Benjamin’s changes.</p>
<p>And with that, we were able to fine tune a 70b model on dual 3090 gaming GPUs for the first time!</p>
<p>To make this work, we were benefiting not just from FSDP and QLoRA, but also from a vast array of clever techniques developed over the last couple of years by the academic and open source communities. We used:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06174">Gradient checkpointing</a> (also known as activation checkpointing) to avoid storing full gradients, instead saving activations at a number of ‘checkpoints’ throughout the model and then re-computing gradients by re-running the forward computation step as needed</li>
<li><a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/fsdp.html#torch.distributed.fsdp.CPUOffload">CPU offloading</a> to store weights in CPU RAM rather than on the GPU when they are not in use, drastically reducing the GPU memory required. This technique isn’t very useful to the “GPU rich” using H100 GPUs, which have highly optimized ways to pass weights to each other. But for our use case, it’s absolutely necessary, since gaming GPUs and motherboards don’t have these systems</li>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08691">Flash Attention 2</a> to efficiently calculate attention using a memory-optimized Cuda kernel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Making these work together with FSDP and QLoRA wasn’t always straightforward. For instance, when using CPU offloading, Benjamin discovered and fixed a problem in bitsandbytes. Each time an “offloaded” weight was copied back to the GPU, it was being automatically re-quantized, which effectively turning the pretrained model into random weights! We made a pull request to bitsandbytes that kept track of which parameters had already been quantized, so we could avoid the redundant computation.</p>
<p>After all this work, we were very pleased to see that we could train large models with consumer GPUs. Jeremy had run detailed benchmarking of the original llama-recipes across a range of GPU hardware, and Kerem developed a comprehensive benchmarking system for the new project. In comparing the two we realized that we were still not able to use the sequence lengths or batch sizes we’d hoped – for some reason more memory was being used than we expected.</p>
<p>When we looked closely, it turned out that it wasn’t due to our FSDP/QLoRA integration at all – but actually as we increased seqlen in bitsandbytes even without FSDP, the memory usage went up super-linearly, eventually resulting in even higher memory usage than without quantization! It turns out that we’re <a href="https://github.com/RahulSChand/gpu_poor/issues/1">not the first</a> people to discover this problem. We don’t have a bitsandbytes solution yet (but it’s being investigated), but it did lead us to an exciting discovery…</p>
</section>
<section id="discovering-hqq">
<h3 data-anchor-id="discovering-hqq">Discovering HQQ</h3>
<p>We love collaborating with like minded people, so when we saw the amazing work being done by Daniel Han on <a href="https://unsloth.ai/">Unsloth</a> we wanted to learn more, and see whether we might be able to help each other out. We asked Daniel if there were other interesting projects in this space that we should be watching, and he pointed us to <a href="https://mobiusml.github.io/hqq_blog/">HQQ</a>.</p>
<p>To explain HQQ, we’ll need to give a bit of background first… The 4-bit quantization done by bitsandbytes uses a simple, fast, and clever approach where each group of parameters is normalized to a consistent range, and then each parameter is placed in a bucket, where the bucket breakpoints are based on an assumption that the parameters are normally distributed. This has the benefit that quantization is nearly instant, but because real model parameters will not exactly fit the assumed distribution, accuracy can suffer.</p>
<p>Other approaches such as GPTQ and the more recent AWQ go in a different direction, where the quantization parameters are optimized based on the actual behavior of the model when representative data is passed to it.<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> These methods tend to produce more accurate models, potentially with even fewer than 4 bits per parameter; but they have the downside that the optimization process can take hours or even days for each model.</p>
<p>HQQ combines the best of both worlds. It is 50x faster to process a 70b model compared to GPTQ, yet is more accurate than it. Kerem decided to investigate whether HQQ would work well with FSDP.</p>
<p>He discovered that making HQQ and FSDP work well together took nearly the exact same steps as was required for bitsandbytes, and as result he had a complete working example completed within days. The <a href="https://www.mobiuslabs.com/">mobius.ml folks</a> couldn’t have been more responsive and helpful in ensuring that our PR was successfully merged – so we are now delighted to announce that FSDP works with HQQ too!</p>

<section id="how-to-use-fsdpqlora">
<h2 data-anchor-id="how-to-use-fsdpqlora">How to use FSDP/QLoRA</h2>
<p>To use FSDP, you will of course need more than one GPU. If you don’t have access to such a system, you can rent a dual 3090 box from the <a href="https://www.runpod.io/">Runpod Community Cloud</a> for around $0.60/hour. There are many other providers to choose from; <a href="https://cloud-gpus.com/">cloud-gpus</a> is a great place to see what’s on offer.</p>
<p>You’ll need to install the latest version of Transformers, PEFT, and bitsandbytes (and HQQ if you’re using that). Then, clone <a href="https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/fsdp_qlora/tree/main">our repo</a> and follow the README there. Running <code>python train.py --help</code> will show the available options. To train llama2-7b on the included alpaca dataset on two 24GB cards you might run:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>python train.py --train_type qlora --dataset alpaca --batch_size 8 --gradient_accumulation_steps 2 --output_dir qlora_output --log_to wandb</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ve crammed everything required into this single file to make it easier to see what is going on and modify things if necessary.</p>
<p>You should treat this script as an alpha/preview release. Whilst we’ve used it to successfully train a variety of practically useful models on a range of hardware, it’s still early days. If you’re not comfortable with testing and debugging models, we’d suggest holding off for a few months whilst the community more fully tests the approach.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-first-step">
<h2 data-anchor-id="a-first-step">A first step</h2>
<p>Originally we’d planned to show some benchmarks in this article, along with guidance based on the benchmark results about how to best take advantage of FSDP/QLoRA. However, we had to keep delaying posting this, because we kept making major improvements every few days! So we’ll follow up with a benchmarking and recommendations article in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>What we’ve shown here is just the first step. We have lots of ideas for improvements, and we’re sure that the open source community will have many other ideas we haven’t even thought of yet!</p>
<p>We hope that seeing this proof of concept, that it’s possible to scale resource-efficient QLoRA training across inexpensive gaming GPUs, will help bring more attention to the problem of bringing down the cost of model training. It’s in everyone’s interest to make AI more accessible – and to enable more people to not only consume, but also build, valuable models.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content-blocks"><div><p><img alt="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/07dd780d-2452-4bb6-b916-05bb0f28cbcf/email-banner.jpg?t=1704584495"></p></div><p> My first year of college, I sat in my dorm room staring at the shadow on the wall cast by the sun coming in through the window. I wouldn’t have internet for another year, and I didn’t have a TV, so I often had to come up with creative ways to entertain myself. </p><p> So I decided to turn my dorm room into a sundial clock, using the shadow on the wall to tell the time. Every hour, I marked on the wall with a pencil where the shadow was. But I very quickly realized that this was not going to work as well as I hoped. </p><p> For one thing, my dorm window faced due West, which meant it didn’t even get sunlight for half the day. For another thing, it occurred to me that as the seasons change and the days get longer or shorter, the shadow would be in a different place each day until it was no longer even remotely accurate — at least until the same day the following year. </p><p> That’s when I realized that sundials suck. </p><p> Even a properly calibrated sundial that aligns with the Earth’s tilt will still be 14 minutes ahead part of the year and 16 minutes behind later. So they depend on the user referring to something called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_time?utm_source=ironicsans.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=the-life-and-death-of-the-bulbdial-clock" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Equation of Time</a> to convert sundial time to actual time. </p><p> And they still won’t work on a cloudy day. </p><p> And if you live in the southern hemisphere, they run backwards. </p><p> In 2008, I came up with a solution to this problem. I <a href="https://www.ironicsans.com/2008/03/idea_the_bulbdial_clock.html?utm_source=ironicsans.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=the-life-and-death-of-the-bulbdial-clock" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">wrote on my blog</a> about an idea I called “The Bulbdial Clock”: </p><p><img alt="" src="https://www.ironicsans.com/images/bulbdial.jpg"></p><div><p>The Bulbdial Clock has no hands — just one pole in the center of the clock, and three light sources of varying heights which revolve around the pole casting shadows. In the model illustrated above, the light sources are each attached to a ring which rotates around the pole. The innermost ring rotates once per minute, casting a “second hand” shadow. The middle ring rotates once per hour, and casts the “minute hand” shadow. And the outer ring rotates once every 12 hours, casting the “little hand” shadow.</p><p>The Bulbdial Clock can be used flat like a traditional sundial, or mounted vertically on a wall. A variation on the design intended for large-scale installation (such as in a museum) involves a pole sticking up in the middle of a room, while the light sources are mounted on the ceiling, shining down on the pole as they rotate around it.</p><p>The Bulbdial Clock solves most of the sundial’s problems, but it still has a problem of its own: It doesn’t work in bright light. So the Bulbdial Clock is best suited for dim spaces such as restaurants and nightclubs.</p></div><p> I wrote a lot of “idea” posts back then, and my blog had active commenters who frequently used them as a <a href="https://www.ironicsans.com/you_made_it/?utm_source=ironicsans.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=the-life-and-death-of-the-bulbdial-clock" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">jumping off point</a> to imagine how they might be even better. I loved that. Sometimes I even held back some of my own thoughts in the hopes that someone else would have the same thought and chime in — a subtle way of fostering conversation in the comments. </p><p> Some of the thoughts I held back for this were: What if instead of being white lights, they were red, green, and blue? Then you would get all the primary and secondary colors where the lights overlap, and white in the middle! That would be cool. And if three rotating lights were too complex to build, it could be a ring of lights that turn on and off so there are no moving parts. </p><p> Sure enough, the post had barely been up for an hour before someone named Windell Oskey left <a href="https://www.ironicsans.com/2008/03/idea_the_bulbdial_clock.html?utm_source=ironicsans.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=the-life-and-death-of-the-bulbdial-clock#comment-276015" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">this comment</a>: </p><div><p>If you used three rings of 60 LEDs each, you could just light up one LED in each of the rings, making it so that you could build this without even using any motors.</p><p>I think that I could build this in about an hour. :)</p></div><p> What I didn’t know at the time is that Windell Oskey was <i>exactly</i> the kind of person who <i>would</i> make something like this. He and his wife Lenore ran a business called Evil Mad Scientist which sold electronic kits for projects people could build themselves. </p><p> Exactly one year later to the day after my post, <a href="https://www.evilmadscientist.com/2009/a-bulbdial-clock/?utm_source=ironicsans.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=the-life-and-death-of-the-bulbdial-clock" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Windell shared</a> on the Evil Mad Scientist website that he had built a working prototype using red, green and blue LEDs: </p><p><img alt="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/111dd296-a214-40e6-91f1-f4f3cef3fcd4/prototype.jpg?t=1709388071"></p><p> And he sent me an email about it which said in part: </p><div><p>We have also toyed with the idea of making a small kit version of our project-- we make soldering kits. Just say the word and we won't touch it, but I suspect that it might work out nicely if we were to sell a few tens or hundeds of kits and send you a small royalty from each.</p></div><p> I was thrilled by the idea of the Bulbdial Clock being something people could buy and build! And a royalty? I’ll take it! </p><p> A quick aside: In the United States, from the time an idea for an invention is publicly disclosed, the inventor has exactly one year to file a patent (or at least a provisional patent which lets you say there’s a “patent pending”). After that grace period, they lose out on any exclusive rights to their invention. </p><p> I had no intention of patenting the Bulbdial Clock, but I mention this because there was no legal reason why Windell owed me a royalty. In fact, Evil Mad Scientist projects were all open source, so anyone could make and learn from them without paying a cent. A royalty was their very kind way of recognizing my idea, and I hugely appreciated it. </p><p> (It’s also worth noting that if I ever did file a patent application, it may have been invalidated by prior art.

<h2>Introduction</h2>









<p>Sine, one of the fundamental trigonometric functions, plays a crucial role in various fields, including mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science. Its calculation is not trivial, especially when it comes to implementing it in electronic calculators, where efficiency and accuracy are paramount.</p>



<p>In previous entries of the series, we looked into <a href="https://androidcalculator.com/how-do-calculators-solve-equations">how calculators solve equations</a> and <a href="https://androidcalculator.com/how-does-a-calculator-computes-square-roots">how they calculate square roots</a>. In this blog post, we’ll delve into the intricate process of calculating the sine function, starting from simple approximations to more sophisticated methods.</p>



<h2>How sine is calculated</h2>



<p>To begin, let’s inspect the plot of the sine function:</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://androidcalculator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/sin-2.svg"><img src="https://androidcalculator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/sin-2.svg" alt="" width="538" height="195"></a></figure></div>



<p>It is immediately obvious, that the function is periodic, and has a strong symmetry of the interval between 0 and $\pi/2$:</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://androidcalculator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/sin_period.svg"><img src="https://androidcalculator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/sin_period.svg" alt="" width="538" height="195"></a></figure></div>



<p>In other words, it is enough to calculate the function on the interval $[0;\pi/2]$. Then, we can just use flipping and negation to get the final value. To calculate $\sin(x)$ within the reduced interval, one option is to use the well-known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series">Taylor series</a> approximation:<br>$$\sin(x) = x-\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^5}{5!}-\ldots$$Visualized:</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://androidcalculator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/taylor.svg"><img src="https://androidcalculator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/taylor.svg" alt="" width="538" height="195"></a><figcaption>The sine function and its Taylor series up to the ninth degree</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>While this method is simple, we need to calculate very high exponentials, and the approximation errors can get quite large around $\pi/2$. For example, with a nine-degree approximation, the result at $ \pi/2 $ would be 1.00000354258428. This is an error of 3e-6, which is quite bad, since most calculations are done to 15 digits precision. In other words, that’s a loss of precision around 10 digits!</p>



<h2>How sine is really calculated</h2>



<p>While the method presented in the previous paragraph is quite bad, it does serve as a blueprint for better methods. Essentially, every implementation of sine uses the following three steps:</p>



<ol>
<li>
<strong>Reduction:</strong> Using some algebraic tricks, reduce $x$ to a small number $r$.</li>
<li>
<strong>Approximation:</strong> Calculate the value of $\sin(r)$ using an approximation method, such as the Taylor series.</li>
<li>
<strong>Reconstruction:</strong> Calculate the final value of $\sin(x)$ based on $\sin(r)$.</li>
</ol>



<p>There are many ways to approach this problem. In the following , I present what Intel uses in their processors, based on their <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/papers/itj.pdf">paper</a>. They start with the formula<br>$$r = x-N\frac{\pi}{16}.$$ Here, $N$ is the integer chosen such that $|r|$ is minimized. In other words, we approximate $x$ by $N\cdot\frac{\pi}{16}$, and $r$ is the approximation error. How can we use this? Using the identities of the sum of arguments:</p>



<p>$$\displaylines{\sin(x)=\sin\left(r+N\frac{\pi}{16}\right)=\sin\left(N\frac{\pi}{16}\right)\cos(r)+\cos\left(N\frac{\pi}{16}\right)\sin(r)=\\=\sin\left(\frac{N}{32}2\pi\right)\cos(r)+\cos\left(\frac{N}{32}2\pi\right)\sin(r)}$$</p>



<p>We have to calculate $\sin(r)$ and $\cos(r)$ – this is the approximation step, more on this later. For now, assume we know both $\sin(r)$ and $\cos(r)$. We still have to find the sine and cosine of $\frac{N}{32}2\pi$. Notice, that both $\sin$ and $\cos$ are periodic by $2\pi$, so we only really have to calculate $N$ for $N=0,1,2,\ldots,31$. These are 32 values in total, we can easily precompute them. During the calculation of the final value, we just have to look up them up from a list, which is quite efficient.</p>



<p>Only one piece of the puzzle remains: how to calculate $\sin(r)$? In the paper, Intel does not publish the exact polynomial but they do mention that they use minimax approximation. This approximation finds a polynomial that minimizes the maximum error over an interval:<br>$$\max_{0\le r&lt;\frac{\pi}{16}}|p(r)-\sin(r)|,$$ where $p$ is the approximating polynomial. One way to calculate $p$ is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remez_algorithm">Remez’s algorithm</a>. The results might look like this:$$x -0.166667x^3 + 0.00833x^5 -0.00019x^7 + 2.6019\cdot10^{-6}x^9.$$The maximum error of this polynomial is $4.1\cdot10^{-9}$, which is a thousand times better than the original Taylor-approximation!</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>In conclusion, calculating sine in computers involves a combination of reduction, approximation, and reconstruction steps. From simple reduction and Taylor series to more precise methods like minimax approximation, computers employ various techniques to compute sine efficiently while maintaining acceptable levels of accuracy. Understanding these methods sheds light on the underlying mathematics that power computational tools and simulations in numerous fields.</p>

            <h2>What is the Pile?</h2>
            <p>
              The Pile is a <span>825 GiB</span> diverse, open
              source language modelling data set that consists of 22 smaller,
              high-quality datasets combined together.

            <h2>Why is the Pile a good training set?</h2>
            <p>
              Recent work has shown that especially for large models, diversity
              in data sources improves general cross-domain knowledge of the
              model, as well as downstream generalization capability. In our
              evaluations, not only do models trained on the Pile show moderate
              improvements in traditional language modeling benchmarks, they
              also show significant improvements on Pile BPB.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Why is the Pile a good benchmark?</h2>
            <p>
              To score well on Pile BPB (bits per byte), a model must be able to
              understand many disparate domains including books, github
              repositories, webpages, chat logs, and medical, physics, math,
              computer science, and philosophy papers. Pile BPB is a measure of
              world knowledge and reasoning ability in these domains, making it
              a robust benchmark of general, cross-domain text modeling ability
              for large language models.

<h3>from the <i>behold-our-self-immolation</i> dept</h3>

<p>When last we checked in with Hewlett Packard (HP), the company&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/01/11/hp-hit-with-yet-another-lawsuit-over-bricking-printers-that-use-third-party-ink-cartridges/">had just been sued</a>&nbsp;(for the second time) for crippling customer printers if owners attempt to use cheaper, third-party printer cartridges. It was just the latest in a long saga where printer manufacturers use DRM or dodgy software updates to wage all out war on consumer choice.</p>
<p>There hasn’t been a whole lot of introspection going on at the company since. Shortly after the lawsuit HP CEO Enrique Lores&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPRMyQSZGuY">went on CNBC</a>&nbsp;to double down on the company’s position. First by making up claims that HP <strong>has</strong> to be obnoxious about cartridges to protect consumer security (false), then by basically stating that any consumer who intelligently shops for cartridges is a “bad investment.” </p>
<p>This week HP unveiled its latest plan on this track: printing as a service. The company’s new “<a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/all-in-plan/printers.html">All-In Plan</a>” requires that you pay anywhere from $7 a month to $36 a month to rent a printer with a set printable page limit. During your rental, HP sends you, of course, their ink cartridges. </p>
<p>As Ars Technica notes, the printer must remain connected to the internet for monitoring. And the company’s <a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/privacy/privacy.html?jumpid=in_R11928_%2Fus%2Fen%2Fcorp%2Fprivacy-central%2Fprivacy-statements&amp;utm_medium=af&amp;utm_source=aw&amp;utm_campaign=Skimlinks&amp;utm_content=78888_Skimlinks_">privacy policy</a> effectively gives HP full control over, well, everything: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Subject to the terms of this Agreement, You hereby grant to HP a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right to use, copy, store, transmit, modify, create derivative works of and display Your non-personal data for its business purposes..”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And of course the subscription comes with long term contracts and early termination fees should you not subscribe for the full two-year term. All told, the tone-deafness is fairly stunning. </p>
<p>Paying for the same several-hundred dollar printer for all eternity is precisely the sort of concept Lores has been pushing for a while. The problem is it’s not clear that anybody <em>actually wants this</em>. It’s also not really clear that paying up to $36 for a printer you never really own makes much value sense. Printers inherently aren’t that expensive. And ink isn’t either, if companies aren’t being restrictive tyrants. </p>
<p>For HP, none of that matters. Lores isn’t thinking about building quality products or building solid relationships. He’s thinking exclusively of finding creative ways to goose profits and deliver Wall Street improved quarterly returns <strong>at any cost</strong>. You can’t do that by simply providing users a quality, affordable product people like; you inevitably have to start cutting corners and nickel-and-diming users. </p>
<p>Once they’ve established renting a printer as a norm, they’ll just steadily jack the rental price skyward as they make the underlying value proposition steadily worse. Ultimately the business becomes less and less about making popular quality products, and more and more about making unnecessarily convoluted subscriptions with creative restrictions and ever-skyrocketing monthly prices. </p>
