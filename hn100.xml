<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>My tech posts often come from kind of a negative place. I wish it wasn‚Äôt like that, but we all know how the mind works: writing with nuance and positivity is a lot harder than fired-up screeds of the ‚Äúsomeone is wrong on the Internet‚Äù variety. I do try to check myself. I know that people come from all kinds of situations and codebases, everyone is doing their best given the conditions they‚Äôre in, and there really is no One True Way to write code. I will at least always try to give a good sense of how I‚Äôd prefer things be done instead, rather than just pointing at something and saying it‚Äôs bad.</p>

<p>But I think there‚Äôs another reason why I come across as negative or angry. And as always with these things it‚Äôs hard to tell if I‚Äôm just jaded and ossified from having spent my entire adult life touching keyboards, or if it has real merit: I feel like the web used to <em>work better</em>. Not in the sense of features or flagship sites‚Äîweb-based email clients and word processors and image editors are all waaay better than they used to be and I would say the high-quality stuff is of higher quality than ever. I‚Äôm not pining for the HTML-only version of GMail, I promise. But if I were to estimate some rough median of ‚Äúhow well do websites work‚Äù I would also say that there‚Äôs an <em>incredible</em> amount of jank out there. My father called me in exasperation last night after trying and failing to book a plane ticket. I find myself having to go over to their house and do things like switch browsers, open private windows, occasionally even open up the Web Inspector to fiddle with the markup, and I hate every second of it. I‚Äôve trained myself out of using the Back button and opening things in new windows, and I will often close and restart order flows rather than try to go back and edit something I messed up. And I just‚Ä¶ WHY. Why is it so hard?</p>

<p>Your web browser is an amazing piece of software. Give it an HTML page and it‚Äôll render and lay it out in milliseconds, and if you let it do what it wants to do (follow a link when it‚Äôs clicked, submit a form with a button, populate input fields, etc) it‚Äôll just <em>work like everyone expects it to</em>. I think that‚Äôs where most of my pathos comes from: I have a lived experience from the Before Times when things were just pages and forms, and it turns out pages and forms get you very, very far.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm a web developer, so I know that the number one cause of jank and breakage is another developer having messed with the browser‚Äôs default way of doing things. I can usually figure out what has been tampered with and work around it. But normal people can‚Äôt. They expect the Back button to work, and they expect that the stuff they filled out on the previous page will be there when they click it. And it would! <em>If you would just let the browser do what it wants to do!</em></p>

<p>I could absolutely write cheerier, more charitable and uplifting tech posts. Everything doesn‚Äôt have to be an aggressive ‚Äúdo better‚Äù response to something or someone. But I assure you those posts come from a place of genuine concern: much of the modern web makes me sad and I feel like I‚Äôm screaming into the wind. Every broken contact form or booking site is a <em>truly spectacular</em> own-goal. If your calendar was a bunch of progressively enhanced checkboxes and a submit button, you could be riding off into the sunset and counting money instead of taking support calls from frustrated octogenarians. And it‚Äôs hard for me to shut up about that.</p>

<p>I care. I really do. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm mad sometimes.</p>

<p dir="auto">LaVague is designed to automate menial tasks on behalf of its users. Many of these tasks are repetitive, time-consuming, and require little to no cognitive effort. By automating these tasks, LaVague aims to free up time for more meaningful endeavors, allowing users to focus on what truly matters to them.</p>
<p dir="auto">By providing an engine turning natural language queries into Selenium code, LaVague is designed to make it easy for users or other AIs to automate easily express web workflows and execute them on a browser.</p>
<p dir="auto">One of the key usages we see is to automate tasks that are personal to users and require them to be logged in, for instance automating the process of paying bills, filling out forms or pulling data from specific websites.</p>
<p dir="auto">LaVague is built on open-source projects and leverages open-sources models, either locally or remote, to ensure the transparency of the agent and ensures that it is aligned with users' interests.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">‚ú® Features</h2><a id="user-content--features" aria-label="Permalink: ‚ú® Features" href="#-features"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Natural Language Processing</strong>: Understands instructions in natural language to perform browser interactions.</li>
<li><strong>Selenium Integration</strong>: Seamlessly integrates with Selenium for automating web browsers.</li>
<li><strong>Open-Source</strong>: Built on open-source projects such as transformers and llama-index, and leverages open-source models, either locally or remote, to ensure the transparency of the agent and ensures that it is aligned with users' interests.</li>
<li><strong>Local models for privacy and control</strong>: Supports local models like <code>Gemma-7b</code> so that users can fully control their AI assistant and have privacy guarantees.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced AI techniques</strong>: Uses a local embedding (<code>bge-small-en-v1.5</code>) first to perform RAG to extract the most relevant HTML pieces to feed the LLM answering the query, as directly dropping the full HTML code would not fit in context. Then leverages Few-shot learning and Chain of Thought to elicit the most relevant Selenium code to perform the action without having to finetune the LLM (<code>Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO</code>) for code generation.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In a new collaboration, IBM and NASA created a suite of efficient language models by training on scientific literature. Based on the transformer architecture, these models can be used in a variety of applications, from classification and entity extraction to question-answering and information retrieval. These models achieve high performance across a variety of domains and can respond promptly. We have open-sourced the models on Hugging Face for the benefit of the scientific and academic community.</p><p>Transformer-based language models ‚Äî which include <a href="https://aclanthology.org/N19-1423/">BERT</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692">RoBERTa</a>, and IBM‚Äôs Slate and Granite family of models, are invaluable for a range of natural language understanding tasks. What powers these models is a statistical understanding of how language works. They are trained on masked language modeling tasks, which learns by reconstructing sentences with words that have been obscured. Tokenizers, which break down words into units for the model, play a critical role in learning a vast vocabulary. While general-purpose text training is effective with popular tokenizers trained on datasets like Wikipedia or BooksCorpus, scientific domains require specialized tokenizers for terms like "phosphatidylcholine."</p><p>We trained our models on 60 billion tokens on a corpus of astrophysics, planetary science, earth science, heliophysics, and biological and physical sciences data. Unlike a generic tokenizer, the one we developed is capable of recognizing scientific terms such as "axes" and "polycrystalline." More than half of the 50,000 tokens our models processed were unique compared to the open-source RoBERTa model on Hugging Face.</p><p>The IBM-NASA models, trained on domain-specific vocabulary, outperformed the open RoBERTa model by 5% on the popular <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/BLURB/">BLURB</a> benchmark, which evaluates performance on biomedical tasks. It also showed a 2.4% F1 score improvement on an internal scientific question-answering benchmark and a 5.5% improvement on internal Earth science entity recognition tests.</p><p>Our trained encoder model can be fine-tuned for many non-generative linguistic tasks and can generate information-rich embeddings for document retrieval through <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401">retrieval augmented generation</a> (RAG). RAG commonly follows a two-step framework: a retriever model first encodes the question and retrieves relevant documents from a vector database. These documents are then passed to a generative model to answer the question while ensuring fidelity to the retrieved document.</p><p>We built a retriever model on top of our encoder model to produce information-rich embeddings that map the similarity between pairs of text. Specifically, we optimize on a contrastive loss function, pushing the embeddings of an anchor text closer to those of a relevant (‚Äúpositive‚Äù) document, and farther away from a random (‚Äúnegative‚Äù) document.</p><p>These models used about 268 million text pairs, including titles and abstracts, and questions and answers.  As a result, they excel at retrieving relevant passages in a test set of about 400 questions that NASA curated. This is evidenced by a 6.5% improvement over a similarly fine-tuned RoBERTa model, and a 5% improvement over <a href="https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5">BGE-base</a>, another popular open-source model for embeddings.</p><p>The significant enhancements achieved by our models can be attributed to the specialized training data, custom tokenizer, and training methodology. Consistent with IBM and NASA‚Äôs commitment to open and transparent AI, both models are available on Hugging Face: the <a href="https://huggingface.co/nasa-impact/nasa-smd-ibm-v0.1">encoder model</a> can be further finetuned for applications in the space domain, while the <a href="https://huggingface.co/nasa-impact/nasa-smd-ibm-st">retriever model</a> can be used for information retrieval applications for RAG. We are also collaborating with NASA to enhance science search engine using these models.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/03/eff-ninth-circuit-theres-no-software-exception-traditional-copyright-limits">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/03/eff-ninth-circuit-theres-no-software-exception-traditional-copyright-limits</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39696482">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Copyright‚Äôs reach is already far too broad, and courts have no business expanding it any further, particularly where that reframing will undermine adversarial interoperability. Unfortunately, a federal district court did just that in the latest iteration of <em>Oracle v. Rimini</em>, concluding that software Rimini developed was a ‚Äúderivative work‚Äù because it was intended to interoperate with Oracle's software, even though the update didn‚Äôt use any of Oracle‚Äôs copyrightable code.</p><p>That‚Äôs a dangerous precedent. If a work is derivative, it may infringe the copyright in the preexisting work from which it, well, derives. For decades, software developers have relied, correctly, on the settled view that a work is not derivative under copyright law unless it is ‚Äúsubstantially similar‚Äù to a preexisting work in both ideas and expression. Thanks to that rule, software developers can build innovative new tools that interact with preexisting works, including tools that improve privacy and security, without fear that the companies that hold rights in those preexisting works would have an automatic copyright claim to those innovations.</p><p>That‚Äôs why EFF, along with a diverse group of stakeholders representing consumers, small businesses, software developers, security researchers, and the independent repair community, filed an <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/eff-rimini-amicus-brief">amicus brief</a> in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals explaining that the district court ruling is not just bad policy, it‚Äôs also bad law.&nbsp; Court after court has confronted the challenging problem of applying copyright to functional software, and until now none have found that the copyright monopoly extends to interoperable software absent substantial similarity. In other words, there is no ‚Äúsoftware exception‚Äù to the definition of derivative works, and the Ninth Circuit should reject any effort to create one.</p><p>The district court‚Äôs holding relied heavily on an erroneous interpretation of a 1998 case, <em>Micro Star v. FormGen</em>. In that case, the plaintiff, FormGen, published a video game following the adventures of action hero Duke Nukem. The game included a software tool that allowed players themselves to build new levels to the game and share them with others. Micro Star downloaded hundreds of those user-created files and sold them as a collection. When FormGen sued for copyright infringement, Micro Star argued that because the user files didn‚Äôt contain art or code from the FormGen game, they were not derivative works.</p><p>The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Micro Star, explaining that:</p></div><div><p><em> [t]he work that Micro Star&nbsp;infringes is the [Duke Nukem] story itself‚Äîa beefy commando type named Duke who wanders around post-Apocalypse Los Angeles, shooting Pig Cops with a gun, lobbing hand grenades, searching for medkits and steroids, using a jetpack to leap over obstacles, blowing up gas tanks, avoiding radioactive slime. A copyright owner holds the right to create sequels and the stories told in the [user files] are surely sequels, telling new (though somewhat repetitive) tales of Duke‚Äôs fabulous adventures.</em></p></div><div><p>Thus, the user files were ‚Äúsubstantially similar‚Äù because they<em> functioned as sequels</em> to the video game itself‚Äîspecifically the story and principal character of the game. If the user files had told a different story, with different characters, they would not be derivative works. For example, a company offering a Lord of the Rings game might include tools allowing a user to create their own character from scratch. If the user used the tool to create a hobbit, that character might be considered a derivative work. A unique character that was simply a 21<sup>st</sup> century human in jeans and a t-shirt, not so much.</p><p>Still, even confined to its facts,<em> Micro Star</em>&nbsp;stretched the definition of derivative work. By misapplying <em>Micro Star</em> to purely functional works that do not incorporate <em>any</em> protectable expression, however, the district court rewrote the definition altogether. If the court‚Äôs analysis were correct, rightsholders would suddenly have a new default veto right in all kinds of works that are intended to ‚Äúinteract and be useable with‚Äù their software. Unfortunately, they are all too likely to use that right to threaten add-on innovation, security, and repair. </p><p>Defenders of the district court‚Äôs approach might argue that interoperable software will often be protected by fair use. As copyrightable software is found in everything from phones to refrigerators, fair use is an essential safeguard for the development of interoperable tools, where those tools might indeed qualify as derivative works. But many developers cannot afford to litigate the question, and they should not have to just because one federal court misread a decades-old case.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>The US economy</span> is showing remarkable health, but in the tech industry, layoffs <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tech-layoffs-2024-amazon-google-discord-twitch/">keep coming</a>. For those out of work, finding a new position can become a full-time job. And in tech‚Äîa sector notoriously always looking for the next hot, new thing‚Äîsome people whose days as fresh-faced coders are long gone say that having decades of experience can feel like a disadvantage.</p><p>Ageism is a longtime problem in the tech industry. Database startup RelevantDB went viral in 2021 after it posted a job listing bragging, ‚Äú<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90669478/we-hire-old-people-job-posting-for-software-developer-sparks-a-viral-conversation-about-ageism-in-tech">We hire old people</a>,‚Äù which played off industry stereotypes. In 2020, the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found that <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-u-s-equal-employment-opportunity-commission-confirms-a-pattern-of-age-discrimination-at-ibm">IBM</a> had engaged in age discrimination, pushing out older workers to make room for younger ones. (The company has <a data-offer-url="https://newsroom.ibm.com/IBM-Chief-Human-Resources-Officer-Addresses-False-Claims-of-Systemic-Age-Discrimination" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://newsroom.ibm.com/IBM-Chief-Human-Resources-Officer-Addresses-False-Claims-of-Systemic-Age-Discrimination&quot;}" href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/IBM-Chief-Human-Resources-Officer-Addresses-False-Claims-of-Systemic-Age-Discrimination" rel="noopener" target="_blank">denied</a> engaging in ‚Äúsystemic age discrimination.‚Äù)</p><p>A recent <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/linkedin-ads_no-one-knows-what-you-do-cloud-salesman-activity-7128022104867819521-gw34/">LinkedIn ad</a> that shows an older woman unfamiliar with tech jargon saying her son sells invisible clouds triggered a backlash from people who say it unfairly portrayed older people as out of touch. In response, Jim Habig, LinkedIn‚Äôs vice president of marketing, says: ‚ÄúThis ad didn't meet our goal to create experiences where all professionals feel welcomed and valued, and we are working to replace the spot.‚Äù</p><p>Ageism is ‚Äúan open secret in the tech industry,‚Äù says Maureen Clough, host of <a data-offer-url="https://www.itgetslateearly.com/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.itgetslateearly.com/&quot;}" href="https://www.itgetslateearly.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>It Gets Late Early</em></a>, a podcast about aging in tech. Even when ageism isn‚Äôt as blatant as the IBM case, she says, it lurks behind common ideas in industry hiring, such as culture fit. ‚ÄúIf you have a company that is predominantly young, white, and male, it‚Äôs going to be harder to get in there,‚Äù Clough says.</p><p>Vern Six, a 58-year-old programmer, says he recently ran into explicit ageism on his job hunt. A recruiter told him that he wouldn‚Äôt be appealing to employers and opined that Six should be chief technology officer at this point in his career, not a software developer, Six says.</p><p>After Six‚Äôs <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7167946832742928385/">LinkedIn post</a> about that encounter went viral, he created a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/14418151/">LinkedIn group</a> for people to discuss ageism in tech. He says he has often thought his age might play a role in job hunting, but ‚Äúthis was the first time I‚Äôve ever had anybody say it directly.‚Äù</p><p>Industry and government data shows that US tech workers skew younger than the wider US workforce, but definitive data on differences in hiring patterns for older and younger tech workers has been hard to gather. That‚Äôs because so many more senior tech workers get jobs by networking or moving between companies where they know people rather than by cold applying, and that‚Äôs tricky to study and quantify, says Joanna Lahey, a professor of public policy at Texas A&amp;M University who studies age discrimination.</p><p>Older workers may be out of work for longer between jobs because they‚Äôre more likely to seek higher salaries or be selective, says Lahey. But if older workers are excluded from some positions because recruiters assume they wouldn‚Äôt take a lower offer or position or are perceived as not fitting into the company culture, that‚Äôs a problem, she says. ‚ÄúThere are a lot of people who have a lot of skills who are unemployed longer than they ought to be. It‚Äôs a loss for them, and it‚Äôs a loss for society.‚Äù</p><figure data-testid="IframeEmbed"></figure><h2>D√©j√† Vu</h2><p>Tech companies have laid off more than 400,000 workers over the past two years, according to <a data-offer-url="https://layoffs.fyi/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://layoffs.fyi/&quot;}" href="https://layoffs.fyi/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Layoffs.fyi</a>, which tracks job cuts in the industry. To older workers, the purge is both a reminder of the dotcom bust, and a new frontier. The industry‚Äôs generally consistent growth in recent decades as the economy has become more tech-centric means that many more senior workers‚Äîwhich in tech can sometimes be considered to mean over 35 but includes people in their late forties, fifties, or sixties‚Äîmay have less experience with job hunting.</p><p>For decades, tech workers could easily hop between jobs in their networks, often poached by recruiters. And as tech companies boomed during the Covid-19 pandemic‚Äôs early days, increased demand for skills gave workers leverage. Now the power has shifted to the employers as companies seek to become efficient and correct that overhiring phase, and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tech-job-interviews-out-of-control/">applicants are hitting walls</a>. Workers have to network, stay active on LinkedIn, join message boards, and stand out. With <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/multi-generation-work-place-1.4980659#:~:text=For%20the%20first%20time%20in%20contemporary%20history%2C%20there%20are%20four,Z%20%E2%80%94%20human%20resources%20experts%20say.">four generations</a> now clocking in to work, things can feel crowded.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>The ‚ÄúProtecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act‚Äù would give the President the power to designate an application under the control of a country considered adversarial to the U.S. to be a national security threat. TikTok would be deemed a threat, meaning that the application would effectively be banned unless it cuts all ties with the foreign adversarial country within 180 days through a forced sale. The same could be true for other applications, like WeChat.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a massive problem that current US law allows for all the big social media platforms to harvest and monetize our personal data, including TikTok. Without comprehensive data privacy legislation, this will continue, and this ban won‚Äôt solve any real or perceived problems. User data will still be collected by numerous platforms and sold to data brokers who sell it to the highest bidder‚Äîincluding governments of countries such as China‚Äîjust as it is now.</p>

<p>TikTok raises special concerns, given the surveillance and censorship practices of the country that its parent company is based in, China. But it‚Äôs also used by hundreds of millions of people to express themselves online, and is an instrumental tool for community building and holding those in power accountable. The US government has not justified silencing the speech of Americans who use TikTok, nor has it justified the indirect speech punishment of a forced sale (which may prove difficult if not impossible to accomplish in the required timeframe). It can‚Äôt meet the high constitutional bar for a restriction on the platform, which would undermine the free speech and association rights of millions of people. This bill must be stopped.</p>

<p dir="auto">We all build software on top of a dynamic set of tools,
frameworks and packages, allowing us to move quickly and only
build what‚Äôs necessary. However, each new wave of dev tooling
innovation results in an entirely new set of dependencies that
need to be managed. What starts as a simple app or microservice
quickly grows complex, and
turns into a expanding and fragmented supply
chain. Flox brings reproducibility and consistency to complex
software development lifecycles.</p>

<h3>from the <i>I-can't-drive-55</i> dept</h3>

<p>Last September, Mozilla came out with a <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/articles/its-official-cars-are-the-worst-product-category-we-have-ever-reviewed-for-privacy/">privacy study</a> indicating that the auto industry was <strong>the worst tech industry the organization tracked</strong>. Mozilla found that not only does the industry hoover up a ton of data from your use of vehicles, it collects and monetizes most of the data on your phone. Often without transparency or adequate safeguards:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>‚Äú<strong>All 25 car brands we researched earned our *Privacy Not Included warning label ‚Äî making cars the official worst category of products for privacy that we have ever reviewed.</strong>‚Äú</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fast forward to this week, and the New York Times‚Äô Kashmir Hill has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/technology/carmakers-driver-tracking-insurance.html?unlocked_article_code=1.cE0.jN6D.nfeyIYUoly5W&amp;smid=url-share">a new story</a> exploring how the auto industry is also collecting reams of personal driving data, then sharing it with your insurance company. More specifically, automakers are selling access to the data to Lexis Nexis, which is then crafting ‚Äúrisk scores‚Äù insurance companies then use to adjust rates. Usually upward. </p>
<p>If consumer approval is even obtained, it‚Äôs obtained via fine print buried deep in user agreements either in automakers‚Äô car apps or road-side assistant apps:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>‚ÄúAutomakers and data brokers that have partnered to collect detailed driving data from millions of Americans say they have drivers‚Äô permission to do so. But the existence of these partnerships is nearly invisible to drivers, whose consent is obtained in fine print and murky privacy policies that few read.‚Äù</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even law professors, who are surely used to reckless treatment of consumer data at this point, were somehow surprised at the cavalier behavior by the auto industry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>‚ÄúI am surprised,‚Äù said Frank Pasquale, a law professor at Cornell University. ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs not within the reasonable expectation of the average consumer, it should certainly be an industry practice to prominently disclose that is happening.‚Äù</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the same auto industry that has been fighting tooth and nail against ‚Äúright to repair‚Äù reforms ‚Äî in a bid to protect their lucrative repair monopolies ‚Äî often under the pretense that they‚Äôre just <strong>that</strong> concerned <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2020/09/11/auto-industry-pushes-bullshit-claim-that-right-to-repair-laws-aid-sexual-predators/">about the consumer privacy ramifications</a>. </p>
<p>Please notice that the <strong>absolute bare minimum</strong> that the auto industry could be doing here is making this tracking and monetization of your data transparent, and <em>they‚Äôre not even doing that</em>. Because they know Congress and U.S. federal regulators, lobbied into apathy over decades, are too corrupt to take meaningful action. At least not at any real, consistent scale. </p>
<p>Again, like countless past scandals, this is the direct byproduct of a country that has proven too corrupt to pass even a baseline privacy law for the internet era. Too corrupt to regulate data brokers. And obsessed with steadily defanging, defunding, under-staffing and curtailing the authority of regulators tasked with overseeing corporations with a broad and reckless disdain for U.S. consumer privacy and safety. </p>
<p>Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-urges-ftc-to-investigate-invasive-data-privacy-practices-of-automakers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">urged</a>&nbsp;the Federal Trade Commission to investigate. And California regulators are purportedly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/california-agency-probes-automakers-data-privacy-practices-2023-07-31/#:~:text=The%20California%20Privacy%20Protection%20Agency,which%20companies%20it%20is%20reviewing.">investigating automaker privacy standards</a>. But a grotesquely corrupt Congress means federal inquiries will likely go nowhere (also keep in mind looming Supreme Court rulings are <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/13/supreme-court-chevron-defense-case-00121535">poised to erode federal regulatory authority further</a>). And any inquiries that do materialize will feature fines that are miniscule compared to the money made from the abuses. </p>
<p>The data-hoovering surveillance economy we‚Äôve created is so lucrative, all the financial incentives point in the wrong directions. And the only thing likely to shake U.S. politicians out of their corrupt stupor is a scandal so extreme ‚Äî potentially involving mass fatalities or the leaked data of the rich and powerful ‚Äî that the problem is no longer easy to ignore. And even then, we‚Äôll <strong>still</strong> probably try. </p>

<p dir="auto">Oxy¬Æ Parser does the heavy lifting of parsing HTMLs for you. It uses Pydantic models to describe the structure of the HTML and then automatically parses the HTMLs into the Pydantic models.:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Describe a Pydantic model of your expected HTML structure</li>
<li>Pass the URL or HTML to Oxy¬Æ Parser together with the Pydantic model</li>
<li>Oxy¬Æ Parser will parse the HTML and return the parsed data as Pydantic models</li>
<li>Oxy¬Æ Parser will also cache the selectors for later re-use, so you don't need to call OpenAI's API every time you want to parse the same HTML</li>

<p dir="auto"><code>LLM_MODEL</code>: The model you want to use. (See LiteLLM docs above for full info on supported LLMs)</p>
<p dir="auto">Scraper keys: they're optional, but if not provided, you will need to scrape and pass the HTMLs to Oxy¬Æ Parser yourself.
However, we highly suggest to use Oxylabs scraper since it will remove the hassle of getting HTMLs and will also
provide you with a lot of other benefits like rotating IPs, handling captchas, bypassing blocks.</p>

For example where description is very long or nested by many elements. In such cases for now we recommend manually
editing the selectors in cache. These shouldn't be an often case though.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>A short policy memo </span><a href="https://fas.org/publication/update-building-codes-to-use-mass-timber/" rel="">recently posted</a><span> on the Federation of American Scientists‚Äô (FAS) website argues that ‚Äúmass timber can help solve the housing shortage.‚Äù It was posted as part of the </span><a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/your-best-ideas-on-increasing-housing" rel="">Housing Ideas Challenge</a><span>, a collaboration between FAS, Matt Yglesias and a few other organizations to generate new, innovative ideas for building more housing.&nbsp;</span></p><p>The memo calls for the federal government to incentivize states to adopt the most recent version of the International Building Code. The latest version of the Code includes new provisions for building tall timber buildings. According to the memo, because mass timber allows buildings to be built faster and cheaper, changing state building codes to allow tall mass timber buildings will unlock more housing construction:</p><blockquote><p><em>Compared to concrete and steel, mass timber buildings are faster to build (therefore often cheaper), just as safe in fires, and create fewer CO2 emissions. Single- and multi-family housing using mass timber components could help with the 7.3 million gap of affordable homes.</em></p><p><em>Broader adoption could meaningfully increase productivity and thereby reduce construction costs. A 25-story mass timber building in Milwaukee completed in 2022 took 75% less time compared to traditional construction techniques. Developers have reported cost savings of up to 35% through lower time and labor costs.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>I don‚Äôt have particular objections to accelerating mass timber adoption. Mass timber is an interesting technology, and it has some decided advantages over constructing buildings out of steel or concrete.

Mass timber products are typically made by taking smaller timber elements (2x4s or 2x6s, sheets of plywood, etc.) and attaching them together to form much larger elements. Glulams, for instance, are made by taking smaller pieces of dimensional lumber (long pieces of lumber such as 2x4s or 2x6s) and gluing them together to form large beams or columns. CLT is likewise made by gluing together layers of dimensional lumber to form large, solid panels that can be used for walls or floors.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9605b11d-b33d-41ff-a1e2-ce1e85622720_1198x896.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9605b11d-b33d-41ff-a1e2-ce1e85622720_1198x896.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9605b11d-b33d-41ff-a1e2-ce1e85622720_1198x896.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9605b11d-b33d-41ff-a1e2-ce1e85622720_1198x896.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9605b11d-b33d-41ff-a1e2-ce1e85622720_1198x896.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9605b11d-b33d-41ff-a1e2-ce1e85622720_1198x896.png" width="550" height="411.35225375626044" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9605b11d-b33d-41ff-a1e2-ce1e85622720_1198x896.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:896,&quot;width&quot;:1198,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:550,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9605b11d-b33d-41ff-a1e2-ce1e85622720_1198x896.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9605b11d-b33d-41ff-a1e2-ce1e85622720_1198x896.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9605b11d-b33d-41ff-a1e2-ce1e85622720_1198x896.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9605b11d-b33d-41ff-a1e2-ce1e85622720_1198x896.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Mass timber building consisting of glulam beams and columns, and CLT floor panels, via Matt Kantner</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>It‚Äôs the large size of the structural elements that makes mass timber an interesting building system. With light-framed wood construction, the risk of fire limits how tall you can safely build; typically 5 stories in the US (hence the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-over-1" rel="">‚Äú5 over 1‚Äù</a><span> construction type so popular in multifamily construction). And some argue that even these limits are too high, based on the fact that the US has a </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/wood-construction-and-the-risk-of" rel="">much higher rate of fire death</a><span> compared to countries that use less light-frame wood.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But large mass timber elements behave differently than smaller light-framed ones during a fire. Specifically, with mass timber a layer of charred wood forms around the outside that protects the wood on the inside from further combustion. Size your structural elements correctly, and a mass timber building will survive a fire much longer than a light-framed wood building. This gives more time for people to evacuate to safety, which makes it possible to safely build much taller buildings out of wood. While light-framed wood is typically limited to 5 stories in the US, mass timber buildings have been </span><a href="https://www.thorntontomasetti.com/project/ascent" rel="">built up to 19 stories</a><span>.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-142559053" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/mass-timber-is-great-but-it-will#footnote-1-142559053" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span></p><p>Besides its better fire performance, there are other reasons to like mass timber. It sequesters a huge amount of carbon because of the volume of wood it uses, so it's far less carbon-intensive than concrete or steel. It‚Äôs often possible to leave mass timber elements exposed in the finished building, which creates an attractive finish for walls or ceilings that some tenants are willing to pay extra for. Because it‚Äôs prefabricated, the structure of a mass timber building is built very fast, and the construction is much quieter than other building methods.</p><p><span>But mass timber has some challenges, particularly cost. Contra the policy memo, mass timber will in general be more expensive than other types of construction, at least in the US.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-142559053" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/mass-timber-is-great-but-it-will#footnote-2-142559053" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> </span><a href="https://warrington.ufl.edu/due-diligence/2023/03/01/mass-timber-primed-for-wider-use/" rel="">The article</a><span> the memo cites as evidence that mass timber can reduce construction cost in fact mentions twice that mass timber is generally more expensive than steel or concrete. The evidence of savings presented in the article is a single developer who claimed they saved 35% on a project by using mass timber. Even if this is true (and I‚Äôm skeptical), it‚Äôs not much evidence. Construction costs vary enough between projects that for any two building materials, it's probably possible to find an example of someone who saved money by switching from one to the other. But the overall trend is clear: a </span><a href="https://timberfinance.ch/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-International-Mass-Timber-Report_Faster-Download-1.pdf" rel="">survey of commercial builders</a><span> in the US found that the median mass timber project had a cost premium of 2%, and in some cases as high as 15%.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-142559053" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/mass-timber-is-great-but-it-will#footnote-3-142559053" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span></p><p>Mass timber is still somewhat nascent in the US, so it‚Äôs reasonable to believe that costs will come down as more projects are built, designers and developers gain experience, and the supply chain becomes more robust. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if it eventually becomes competitive with structural steel or concrete in the US. But the challenge for mass timber as an enabler of housing construction isn‚Äôt with steel or concrete, but with light-framed wood.</p><p><span>In 2022, </span><a href="https://www.census.gov/construction/chars/current.html" rel="">there were</a><span> just over 1 million single family homes built in the US, and 368,000 multifamily units. Of these, the overwhelming majority were built using light-framed wood construction: 94% of the single family homes, and 73% of the multifamily units.</span></p><p><span>This is a problem for the idea of mass timber as a housing enabler, because mass timber has some inherent cost disadvantages compared to light-framed wood construction. First, for a given structure, mass timber will require more material to build it than light-framed wood will. Consider, for instance, the framing for a building‚Äôs floor. Per </span><a href="https://www.smartlam.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SmartLam-2020-Cross-Laminated-Timber-Specification-Guide_June_compressed.pdf" rel="">Smartlam‚Äôs span tables</a><span> for their CLT panels, a 5-ply panel supporting residential loading can span 21 feet under typical residential loading. If we were framing the same floor using light-framed wood, one option would be to use wood trusses: for a 21 foot span, under residential loading, we can use 16 inch deep </span><a href="https://alpineitw.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/floor-truss-guide-compressed2.pdf" rel="">wood trusses</a><span> spaced at 24 inches on center, with a 3/4 inch thick sheet of plywood on top.</span></p><p>Both CLT and wood trusses are made from dimensional lumber stitched together.

But the basic relationship holds: mass timber uses much more wood than light-framed timber to support the same load.</p><p><span>The second cost disadvantage of mass timber compared to light-framed wood construction is that it adds extra processing steps. To produce construction lumber, trees are cut down and brought to a sawmill, where they‚Äôre cut into dimensional lumber (2x4s, 2x6s, etc) or processed into other timber products such as plywood or OSB. Much light-framed wood construction, such as walls and roof rafters, uses dimensional lumber that comes directly from the sawmill. In other cases, such as with floor trusses, the lumber must go through another processing step between the mill and the construction site, but the equipment for this processing is relatively simple and inexpensive. </span><a href="https://www.woodtechsystems.com/product/2003-alpine-floormaster-floor-truss-machine/" rel="">Here</a><span>, for instance, is a used floor truss machine going for less than the price of a fully loaded F-150.</span></p><p><span>With mass timber, on the other hand, </span><em>all</em><span> of the lumber must go through a second processing step to turn it into mass timber products, and this processing step is more expensive than the comparatively simpler truss fabrication. Fabricating CLT panels, for instance, requires an </span><a href="https://kallesoemachinery.com/system-solutions/clt-system-solutions/" rel="">involved production line</a><span> that includes conveyor belts, jointing machines, gluing machines, presses, planing machinery, and (probably) CNC cutting, the combined cost of which can easily be </span><a href="http://www.wooddesignandbuilding.com/the-evolution-of-clt-manufacturing-in-north-america/" rel="">in the millions</a><span>.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-142559053" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/mass-timber-is-great-but-it-will#footnote-4-142559053" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span></p><p><span>Because it uses more material and requires more, costlier processing steps, mass timber has some inherent cost disadvantages compared to light-framed wood construction.

But most construction (residential or otherwise) isn‚Äôt tall enough for this to matter ‚Äî over 90% of housing in the US is in buildings 3 stories tall or less, and </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/every-building-in-america-an-analysis" rel="">just 2.5% of housing units</a><span> in the US are in buildings seven or more stories tall.</span></p><p><span>Canada‚Äôs experience with mass timber can give us a glimpse of what full-throated support of mass timber might mean for US housing construction. Like the US, Canada has enormous supplies of wood, and builds much of its housing using light-framed wood construction. Canada, especially the province of British Columbia (BC) has led the charge for the use of mass timber in North America. The Canadian forest product non-profit FPInnovations published a widely-used </span><a href="https://web.fpinnovations.ca/download/clt-handbook-2019-full-edition/" rel="">CLT design handbook</a><span> in 2011, and in 2018 Canada built what at the time was the world‚Äôs tallest mass-timber building, the </span><a href="https://www.thinkwood.com/construction-projects/brock-commons-tallwood-house" rel="">18-story Brock Commons</a><span>. Canada‚Äôs national and provincial building codes have steadily increased the height allowance for timber buildings (though they often fall short of what the current version of the IBC allows), and many provinces have passed legislation requiring wood be the first material considered for publicly funded projects. Many prominent mass timber manufacturers and designers, such as </span><a href="https://seagatemasstimber.com/" rel="">Seagate</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.nordic.ca/en" rel="">Nordic</a><span>, </span><a href="https://eqcanada.com/" rel="">Equilibrium</a><span>, </span><a href="https://mg-architecture.ca/" rel="">Michael Green Architecture</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://structurecraft.com/" rel="">Structurecraft</a><span> are located in Canada. As of 2022, the province of BC alone </span><a href="https://www.thinkwood.com/construction-projects/brock-commons-tallwood-house" rel="">had constructed</a><span> nearly as many mass timber buildings as the entire US.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-142559053" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/mass-timber-is-great-but-it-will#footnote-6-142559053" target="_self" rel="">6</a></span></p><p><span>But government enthusiasm and a robust ecosystem hasn‚Äôt translated into large volumes of residential mass timber construction. Per the 2021 </span><a href="https://d1ied5g1xfgpx8.cloudfront.net/pdfs/40364.pdf" rel="">State of Mass Timber in Canada report</a><span>, between 2007 and 2021 Canada constructed nearly 500 mass timber projects, but just 39 of these were residential projects. This is a tiny fraction of the thousands of apartment buildings built in Canada using other construction methods over the same time period.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7-142559053" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/mass-timber-is-great-but-it-will#footnote-7-142559053" target="_self" rel="">7</a></span></p><p>Like in the US, mass timber is still somewhat nascent in Canada, and I expect the number of mass timber buildings to continue to trend upward over time and costs to continue to fall. Nevertheless, the small residential penetration of mass timber in Canada should give pause to anyone who expects it to drive increased volumes of housing construction in the US.</p><p>It's also worth noting that not adopting the latest building code doesn't necessarily prevent mass timber buildings from being built now, though it certainly makes it easier. Older codes have provisions that allow for shorter mass timber buildings (called Type IV construction), and they can also be built using the code provisions that current light-framed wood structures use (Type III or Type V construction). The updated codes are specifically required only for tall mass timber buildings, or where the mass timber will be left exposed in the final condition.&nbsp;</p><p>But even here, it‚Äôs often possible to get taller mass timber buildings constructed without updating the code. Because the most recent version of the IBC has allowances for tall mass timber buildings, building officials are often willing to accept them even if their state code doesn‚Äôt technically allow them. Several tall mass timber buildings in the US, such as Ascent in Milwaukee, have been built without the state adopting the 2021 IBC‚Äôs mass timber provisions.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, just because a state has adopted the 2021 IBC doesn‚Äôt mean that there won‚Äôt be permitting roadblocks for tall mass timber buildings. Building officials are cautious by nature, and they‚Äôre often reluctant to allow taller wood buildings without very careful consideration, despite what the code says. And what they say goes. Adopting the most recent IBC would reduce the permitting barriers to mass timber adoption, and I‚Äôm in favor of it, but it‚Äôs not like flipping a switch where suddenly mass timber buildings are now possible.</p><p><span>I like mass timber; I </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/another-day-in-katerradise" rel="">spent several years</a><span> at a startup that was trying to make mass produced mass-timber construction happen. It's good for a lot of things, particularly for low-carbon construction, and I'm happy that it's slowly becoming more popular in the US. I think it can ultimately become a popular, competitive construction technology. But it won't jumpstart US homebuilding.</span></p><p><em><span>Thanks to Matt Kantner of </span><a href="https://eqcanada.com/" rel="">Equilibrium Consulting</a><span> for reading a draft of this.

The service, available in English and Spanish, underwent "weeks of successful testing" before the launch, the US Treasury Department <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2172">said today</a>.</p>
<p>"Direct File provides a free, secure option for taxpayers with simple tax situations in 12 states to file their taxes directly with the IRS," the Treasury Department said. "Direct File is easy to use, with no hidden junk fees, and works as well on a smartphone as it does on a laptop, tablet, or desktop computer. Direct File shows taxpayers the math so they can be sure that their return is accurate, and they are getting the refund they are entitled to."</p>
<p>You can check whether you qualify to use the system at <a href="https://directfile.irs.gov/">directfile.irs.gov</a>. Based on the eligibility restrictions in the IRS program, the Treasury Department said it "estimates that one-third of all federal income tax returns filed could be prepared using Direct File."</p>
<p>In the 12 eligible states combined, the department estimates that 18.7 million taxpayers are eligible for Direct File. That includes a high of 5.2 million taxpayers in California and a low of 80,000 in Wyoming. "Thousands of taxpayers across all 12 states have already successfully filed returns during the pilot's testing phase," the Treasury Department said.</p>
<p>The government is calling this year's version of Direct File a pilot program. It will presumably expand to more states and perhaps have fewer restrictions on who can file in future years.</p>
<h2>State tax options vary</h2>
<p>Arizona, California, Massachusetts, and New York worked with the IRS to integrate their state taxes into the Direct File pilot, the IRS <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/irs-to-offer-free-tax-filing-in-competition-against-much-criticized-turbotax/">said in October 2023</a>. The pilot is also available in eight states without an income tax: Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The IRS originally said that Alaska, which also has no income tax, was slated to be part of the pilot. But the state was not included in the end. "The Direct File pilot does not support reporting the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend for federal income tax reporting purposes," the IRS was <a href="https://alaskapublic.org/2024/01/12/alaska-excluded-from-free-irs-direct-tax-filing-pilot-program/">quoted as saying</a> in January.</p>
<p>There are different options for state taxes depending on what state you live in. There's a <a href="https://www.fileyourstatetaxes.org/">free state filing tool</a> for Arizona and New York that integrates with IRS Direct File. Users in California and Massachusetts will be <a href="https://directfile.irs.gov/state">directed</a> to their respective state's online tax tools for filing state taxes.</p>
<h2>What you can and can‚Äôt file</h2>
<p>Direct File supports employment income, unemployment compensation, Social Security benefits, and $1,500 or less in interest income. But there are many limits that would prevent taxpayers from using the system.</p>
<p>Income types that cannot be reported with Direct File include income from payment apps, online marketplaces, or payment cards; income from independent contractor and gig work; income from rent, prizes, and awards; income from pension and retirement account distributions; allocated tips and unreported tips; and alimony.</p>
<p>Direct File is further <a href="https://directfile.irs.gov/income">limited by the amount of income</a>. You can't use Direct File if your wages were over $200,000, or $160,200 if you had more than one employer. Direct File also isn't available to those who use the filing status "Married Filing Separately" and had wages of more than $125,000. For a married couple filing a joint return, there is a combined wage limit of $250,000.</p>
<p>There's another limit related to how you obtain health insurance. Direct File won't work if you bought health insurance from a HealthCare.gov marketplace or if you withdrew money from a health savings account. Other types of health insurance are supported.</p>
<p>Direct File supports the Child Tax Credit, the Earned Income Tax Credit, and the Credit for Other Dependents but does not support other types of credits. Itemized deductions also are not supported, though the IRS says that about 90 percent of people filing federal taxes use the standard deduction.</p>

<p>I didn‚Äôt know what to expect from this 1937 video explanation of how wire photos were transmitted to newspapers, but a double stunt sequence featuring an airplane and a death-defying photographer was not anywhere on my bingo card. This starts kinda slow but it picks up once they get into the completely fascinating explanation of how they sent photographs across the country using ordinary telephone lines. The whole setup was portable and they just hacked into a wire on a telephone pole, asked the operator to clear the line, and sent a photo scan via an analog modem. Ingenious!</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirephoto">The Wikipedia page about wire photos</a> is worth a read ‚Äî French designers argued that the technology was responsible for an early form of fast fashion.</p>

<blockquote><p>After World War II at haute couture shows in Paris, Frederick L. Milton would sketch runway designs and transmit his sketches via B√©linographe to his subscribers, who could then copy Parisian fashions. In 1955, four major French couturiers (Lanvin, Dior, Patou, and Jacques Fath) sued Milton for piracy, and the case went to the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court. Wirephoto enabled a speed of transmission that the French designers argued damaged their businesses.</p></blockquote>

    </div><p>Imported giant sequoia trees are well adapted to the UK, growing at rates close to their native ranges and capturing large amounts of carbon during their long lives, finds a new study led by UCL researchers with colleagues at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.</p>


										      
																																	<p>The new research, published in <i>Royal Society Open Science</i>, found that the most massive species of redwood trees, Sequoiadendron giganteum, known as the giant sequoia, can potentially pull an average of 85 kilograms of carbon out of the atmosphere per year. Though introduced to the UK 160 years ago, this is the first time the trees' growth rate and resilience in the UK have been analyzed.</p>
<p>There are an estimated half a million redwoods in the UK and more are being planted, partly due to their public appeal. In the wild, they are endangered with fewer than 80,000 giant sequoias remaining in their native California range.</p>
<p>Lead author Ross Holland, formerly a Master's student at the UCL Department of Geography and now at East Point Geo, said, "Giant sequoias are some of the most massive organisms on Earth and in their native range make up some of the most carbon-dense forests in the world due to their great age. We found that UK redwoods are well adapted to the UK and able to capture a large amount of carbon dioxide. We hope that these findings can help guide decisions on future tree planting and management."</p>

<p>The researchers emphasize that the most effective way to mitigate <a href="https://phys.org/tags/climate+change/" rel="tag">climate change</a> is by reducing <a href="https://phys.org/tags/carbon+emissions/" rel="tag">carbon emissions</a> from burning fossil fuels. Trees can help by absorbing carbon emissions, but they also provide other important climate, ecosystem and well-being benefits.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>Giant sequoias grow quickly and are also some of the longest-lived organisms in the world, keeping up their rapid growth throughout their 3,000-plus year lives. They can grow up to 90 meters tall, and while not quite the tallest in the world (that title goes to their closely-related cousin the coastal redwood), their wide trunks grow out, giving them the greatest volumes. In addition, they're fire resistant, able to survive blazes that would wipe out forests of other tree species.</p>
<p>The trees grow best in their native range in California's Sierra Nevada mountains, so the researchers wanted to gauge how they fare under UK climates, which are milder and with a wider range of rainfall. They compiled the first dedicated map of giant sequoias in the UK, mapping nearly 5,000 individual known trees.</p>
<p>The team visited three groves of trees, located at Wakehurst, the wild botanic garden of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in Sussex, Havering Country Park in Essex, and Benmore Botanical Garden in Scotland. They set up terrestrial laser scanners to map the trees in 3D, enabling them to measure the heights and volumes very accurately and to create 3D models of 97 representative trees.</p>

    </div>
<p>Co-author Dr. Phil Wilkes, formerly of UCL and now at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, said, "Using the latest laser scanning technology has allowed us to accurately 'weigh' these massive trees without having to cut them down. This means we can measure many more trees as well as revisit them in the future."</p>

																																			<p>The tallest tree they found measured about 180 feet tall (54.87 meters)‚Äîgiant compared with most native UK species, but dwarfed by their American counterparts. This is in part because of the UK sequoias' youth: the oldest giant sequoias in the UK are those at Benmore, the earliest dating to 1863.</p>
<p>Knowing when the trees were planted allowed the team to calculate their average growth rates under the varying climate conditions between the three UK sites. They found that the trees at Kew and Benmore grew at similar rates as their US counterparts, although growing slightly taller and slimmer at Benmore compared to Wakehurst, while at Havering the trees grew more slowly, likely due to less rainfall in the region and competition from dense local woodland.</p>
<p>Though giant sequoia stack up well for sequestering carbon, the researchers caution that planting trees requires long-term commitment, and consideration needs to be given to how well they will thrive in the UK's changing climate in the next 160 years and beyond.</p>

    </div>
<p>Senior author, Professor Mat Disney (UCL Geography), said, "These results give us an important baseline for estimating how well giant sequoias are doing in the UK climate. Currently, these trees are probably more important for their aesthetic and historical interest than they are for solving the climate crisis. But as more are planted we need to know how they will grow.</p>
<p>"The history of these trees in Britain is fascinating‚Äîinitially as symbols of wealth and power, through to now being widely planted in parks and woodlands. They are iconic, but there is almost no work on how fast they grow or how well they will do in the UK's changing climate. I find it amazing to see these giants dotted across the landscape and see how rapidly they are growing."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It remains the mystery at the heart of Boeing Co.‚Äôs 737 Max crisis: how a company renowned for meticulous design made seemingly basic software mistakes leading to a pair of deadly crashes. Longtime Boeing engineers say the effort was complicated by a push to outsource work to lower-paid contractors.</p><p>The Max software„Éºplagued by issues that could keep the planes grounded months longer after U.S. regulators this week revealed a new flaw„Éºwas developed at a time Boeing was laying off experienced engineers and pressing suppliers to cut costs.</p><p>Increasingly, the iconic American planemaker and its subcontractors have relied on temporary workers making as little as $9 an hour to develop and test software, often from countries lacking a deep background in aerospace„Éºnotably India.</p><p>In offices across from Seattle‚Äôs Boeing Field, recent college graduates employed by the Indian software developer HCL Technologies Ltd. occupied several rows of desks, said Mark Rabin, a former Boeing software engineer who worked in a flight-test group that supported the Max.</p><p>The coders from HCL were typically designing to specifications set by Boeing. Still, ‚Äúit was controversial because it was far less efficient than Boeing engineers just writing the code,‚Äù Rabin said. Frequently, he recalled, ‚Äúit took many rounds going back and forth because the code was not done correctly.‚Äù</p><p>Boeing‚Äôs cultivation of Indian companies appeared to pay other dividends. In recent years, it has won several orders for Indian military and commercial aircraft, such as a $22 billion one in January 2017 to supply SpiceJet Ltd. That order included 100 737-Max 8 jets and represented Boeing‚Äôs largest order ever from an Indian airline, a coup in a country dominated by Airbus.</p><p>Based on resumes posted on social media, HCL engineers helped develop and test the Max‚Äôs flight-display software, while employees from another Indian company, Cyient Ltd., handled software for flight-test equipment.</p><h3><strong>Costly Delay</strong></h3><p>In one post, an HCL employee summarized his duties with a reference to the now-infamous model, which started flight tests in January 2016: ‚ÄúProvided quick workaround to resolve production issue which resulted in not delaying flight test of 737-Max (delay in each flight test will cost very big amount for Boeing).‚Äù</p><p>Boeing said the company did not rely on engineers from HCL and Cyient for the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, which has been linked to the Lion Air crash last October and the Ethiopian Airlines disaster in March. The Chicago-based planemaker also said it didn‚Äôt rely on either firm for another software issue disclosed after the crashes: a cockpit warning light that wasn‚Äôt working for most buyers.</p><p>‚ÄúBoeing has many decades of experience working with supplier/partners around the world,‚Äù a company spokesman said. ‚ÄúOur primary focus is on always ensuring that our products and services are safe, of the highest quality and comply with all applicable regulations.‚Äù</p><p>In a statement, HCL said it ‚Äúhas a strong and long-standing business relationship with The Boeing Company, and we take pride in the work we do for all our customers. However, HCL does not comment on specific work we do for our customers. HCL is not associated with any ongoing issues with 737 Max.‚Äù</p><p>Recent simulator tests by the Federal Aviation Administration suggest the software issues on Boeing‚Äôs best-selling model run deeper. The company‚Äôs shares fell this week after the regulator found a further problem with a computer chip that experienced a lag in emergency response when it was overwhelmed with data.</p><p>Engineers who worked on the Max, which Boeing began developing eight years ago to match a rival Airbus SE plane, have complained of pressure from managers to limit changes that might introduce extra time or cost.</p><p>‚ÄúBoeing was doing all kinds of things, everything you can imagine, to reduce cost, including moving work from Puget Sound, because we‚Äôd become very expensive here,‚Äù said Rick Ludtke, a former Boeing flight controls engineer laid off in 2017. ‚ÄúAll that‚Äôs very understandable if you think of it from a business perspective. Slowly over time it appears that‚Äôs eroded the ability for Puget Sound designers to design.‚Äù</p><p>Rabin, the former software engineer, recalled one manager saying at an all-hands meeting that Boeing didn‚Äôt need senior engineers because its products were mature. ‚ÄúI was shocked that in a room full of a couple hundred mostly senior engineers we were being told that we weren‚Äôt needed,‚Äù said Rabin, who was laid off in 2015.</p><p>The typical jetliner has millions of parts„Éºand millions of lines of code„Éºand Boeing has long turned over large portions of the work to suppliers who follow its detailed design blueprints.</p><p>Starting with the 787 Dreamliner, launched in 2004, it sought to increase profits by instead providing high-level specifications and then asking suppliers to design more parts themselves. The thinking was ‚Äúthey‚Äôre the experts, you see, and they will take care of all of this stuff for us,‚Äù said Frank McCormick, a former Boeing flight-controls software engineer who later worked as a consultant to regulators and manufacturers. ‚ÄúThis was just nonsense.‚Äù</p><p>Sales are another reason to send the work overseas. In exchange for an $11 billion order in 2005 from Air India, Boeing promised to invest $1.7 billion in Indian companies. That was a boon for HCL and other software developers from India, such as Cyient, whose engineers were widely used in computer-services industries but not yet prominent in aerospace.</p><p>Rockwell Collins, which makes cockpit electronics, had been among the first aerospace companies to source significant work in India in 2000, when HCL began testing software there for the Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based company. By 2010, HCL employed more than 400 people at design, development and verification centers for Rockwell Collins in Chennai and Bangalore.</p><p>That same year, Boeing opened what it called a ‚Äúcenter of excellence‚Äù with HCL in Chennai, saying the companies would partner ‚Äúto create software critical for flight test.‚Äù In 2011, Boeing named Cyient, then known as Infotech, to a list of its ‚Äúsuppliers of the year‚Äù for design, stress analysis and software engineering on the 787 and the 747-8 at another center in Hyderabad.</p><p>The Boeing rival also relies in part on offshore engineers. In addition to supporting sales, the planemakers say global design teams add efficiency as they work around the clock. But outsourcing has long been a sore point for some Boeing engineers, who, in addition to fearing job losses say it has led to communications issues and mistakes.</p><h3><strong>Moscow Mistakes</strong></h3><p>Boeing has also expanded a design center in Moscow. At a meeting with a chief 787 engineer in 2008, one staffer complained about sending drawings back to a team in Russia 18 times before they understood that the smoke detectors needed to be connected to the electrical system, said Cynthia Cole, a former Boeing engineer who headed the engineers‚Äô union from 2006 to 2010.</p><p>‚ÄúEngineering started becoming a commodity,‚Äù said Vance Hilderman, who co-founded a company called TekSci that supplied aerospace contract engineers and began losing work to overseas competitors in the early 2000s.</p><p>U.S.-based avionics companies in particular moved aggressively, shifting more than 30% of their software engineering offshore versus 10% for European-based firms in recent years, said Hilderman, an avionics safety consultant with three decades of experience whose recent clients include most of the major Boeing suppliers.</p><p>With a strong dollar, a big part of the attraction was price. Engineers in India made around $5 an hour; it‚Äôs now $9 or $10, compared with $35 to $40 for those in the U.S. on an H1B visa, he said. But he‚Äôd tell clients the cheaper hourly wage equated to more like $80 because of the need for supervision, and he said his firm won back some business to fix mistakes.</p><p>HCL, once known as Hindustan Computers, was founded in 1976 by billionaire Shiv Nadar and now has more than $8.6 billion in annual sales. With 18,000 employees in the U.S. and 15,000 in Europe, HCL is a global company and has deep expertise in computing, said Sukamal Banerjee, a vice president. It has won business from Boeing on that basis, not on price, he said: ‚ÄúWe came from a strong R&amp;D background.‚Äù</p><p>Still, for the 787, HCL gave Boeing a remarkable price ‚Äì free, according to Sam Swaro, an associate vice president who pitched HCL‚Äôs services at a San Diego conference sponsored by Avionics International magazine in June. He said the company took no up-front payments on the 787 and only started collecting payments based on sales years later, an ‚Äúinnovative business model‚Äù he offered to extend to others in the industry.</p><p>The 787 entered service three years late and billions of dollars over budget in 2011, in part because of confusion introduced by the outsourcing strategy. Under Dennis Muilenburg, a longtime Boeing engineer who became chief executive in 2015, the company has said that it planned to bring more work back in-house for its newest planes.</p><h3><strong>Engineer Backwater</strong></h3><p>The Max became Boeing‚Äôs top seller soon after it was offered in 2011. But for ambitious engineers, it was something of a ‚Äúbackwater,‚Äù said Peter Lemme, who designed the 767‚Äôs automated flight controls and is now a consultant. The Max was an update of a 50-year-old design, and the changes needed to be limited enough that Boeing could produce the new planes like cookie cutters, with few changes for either the assembly line or airlines. ‚ÄúAs an engineer that‚Äôs not the greatest job,‚Äù he said.</p><p>Rockwell Collins, now a unit of United Technologies Corp., won the Max contract for cockpit displays, and it has relied in part on HCL engineers in India, Iowa and the Seattle area. A United Technologies spokeswoman didn‚Äôt respond to a request for comment.Contract engineers from Cyient helped test flight test equipment. Charles LoveJoy, a former flight-test instrumentation design engineer at the company, said engineers in the U.S. would review drawings done overnight in India every morning at 7:30 a.m. ‚ÄúWe did have our challenges with the India team,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey met the requirements, per se, but you could do it better.‚Äù</p><p>Multiple investigations ‚Äì including a Justice Department criminal probe ‚Äì are trying to unravel how and when critical decisions were made about the Max‚Äôs software. During the crashes of Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines planes that killed 346 people, investigators suspect, the MCAS system pushed the planes into uncontrollable dives because of bad data from a single sensor.</p><p>That design violated basic principles of redundancy for generations of Boeing engineers, and the company apparently never tested to see how the software would respond, Lemme said. ‚ÄúIt was a stunning fail,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúA lot of people should have thought of this problem ‚Äì not one person ‚Äì and asked about it.‚Äù</p><p>Boeing also has disclosed that it learned soon after Max deliveries began in 2017 that a warning light that might have alerted crews to the issue with the sensor wasn‚Äôt installed correctly in the flight-display software. A Boeing statement in May, explaining why the company didn‚Äôt inform regulators at the time, said engineers had determined it wasn‚Äôt a safety issue.</p><p>‚ÄúSenior company leadership,‚Äù the statement added, ‚Äúwas not involved in the review.‚Äù</p><p><em>By Peter Robison</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 09 Jan 2022</p>
<p>
  During discussions with my friends and colleagues, whenever the
  topic of chat protocols comes up, I often remark how simple the
  Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol is and how this simplicity has
  fostered creativity in the lives of many young computer hobbyists
  growing up in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  For many of us who
  were introduced to the Internet during that time, writing an IRC bot
  turned out to be one of our first few non-trivial hobby programming
  projects that involved network sockets, did something meaningful,
  and served actual users.
</p>
<h2 id="simplicity">Simplicity<a href="#simplicity"></a></h2>
<p>
  The underlying payloads that IRC servers and clients exchange during
  an IRC session are quite simple to read manually and understand.
  While implementing IRC servers still involves significant work to
  keep track of users, channels, and exchanging network state and
  messages between servers, implementing IRC clients can often be
  quite simple.  With a convenient programming language, one can
  develop all kinds of fun tools and bots pretty quickly.  Only
  creativity is the limit!
</p>
<p>
  In the early days of IRC, it was quite common for someone with basic
  programming skills to write a simple IRC bot within a matter of
  hours.  Such IRC bots typically responded to requests from users,
  answered frequently asked questions, hosted trivia quiz, etc.  The
  simplicity of the protocol made it very enticing to write programs
  that could talk to IRC servers directly.  In fact, many people chose
  to write the code to parse and create IRC payloads from scratch.
  Observing the TCP/IP packets with a packet analyzer such as
  Wireshark or Tcpdump was all one needed to learn about the various
  payload formats. Additionally,
  <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1459">RFC 1459</a> served
  as a good reference to learn the IRC specification.
</p>
<p>
  As a result of the simplicity of the IRC protocol, sometimes when I
  would find myself needing to join an IRC channel, say to seek some
  technical help, from a system without an IRC client installed, I
  would often just start a <code>telnet</code>, <code>nc</code>,
  or <code>openssl</code> connection directly to my favourite IRC
  network and then type out IRC protocol commands by hand to join the
  channel I need and talk to channel users.
</p>

<h2 id="session">Session<a href="#session"></a></h2>
<p>
  To illustrate how simple the IRC protocol is, here is an example of
  a minimal IRC session that involves joining a channel and posting a
  message:

  In the above session, the user connects to the Libera Chat network
  with the nickname <code>humpty</code>, joins a channel
  named <code>#test</code>, and posts a message.
</p>
<p>
  Note that the above session is not encrypted.  By convention, IRC
  port 6667 is used for cleartext connections.  A separate port, such
  as port 6697, is available for encrypted connections.  Here is an
  example of an encrypted IRC session established with the OpenSSL
  command line tool:
</p>
<pre><samp>$ <kbd>openssl s_client -quiet -connect irc.libera.chat:6697 2&gt; /dev/null</kbd>
:strontium.libera.chat NOTICE * :*** Checking Ident

</pre>
<p>
  The ellipsis denotes lines omitted for the sake of brevity.  The
  remainder of the session is quite similar to the first example in
  this post.
</p>
<p>
  It is worth noting here that although the payload format of IRC
  protocol is quite simple, as one starts writing IRC clients, one
  would stumble upon several tiny details about the protocol that
  needs to be taken care of, e.g., authenticating to the network,
  responding to <code>PING</code> messages from the server to avoid
  ping timeouts, splitting messages into shorter messages so that the
  overall payload does not exceed the message length limit of 512
  characters, etc.  For a serious IRC client, relying on a suitable
  library that already solves these problems and implements the IRC
  specification accurately is of course going to be useful.  But for a
  hobbyist who wants to understand the protocol and write some tools
  for fun, the textual nature of the IRC protocol and its simplicity
  offers a fertile ground for experimentation and creativity.

<p>
  In case you have never used IRC but this post has piqued your
  interest and you want to try it out, you probably don't want to be
  typing out IRC payloads by hand.  You would want a good IRC client
  instead.  Let me share some convenient ways to connect to the Libera
  Chat network.  Say, you want to join the <code>#python</code>
  channel on Libera Chat network.  Here are some ways to do it:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Join via web interface:
      <a href="https://web.libera.chat/#python">web.libera.chat/#python</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Join using Irssi: On macOS, run <code>brew install irssi</code>
      to install it.  On Debian, Ubuntu, or a Debian-based Linux
      system, run <code>sudo apt-get install irssi</code>.  Then
      enter <code>irssi -c irc.libera.chat</code> to connect to Libera
      Chat.  Then within Irssi, type <code>/join #python</code>.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  There are numerous other ways to join IRC networks.  There are GUI
  desktop clients, web browser plugins, Emacs plugins, web-based
  services, bouncers, etc. that let users connect to IRC networks in
  various ways.  On Libera Chat, there are various channels for open
  source projects (<code>#emacs</code>, <code>#linux</code>, etc.),
  communities around specific subjects (<code>##math</code>,
  <code>#physics</code>, etc.), programming languages
  (<code>#c</code>, <code>#c++</code>, <code>#commonlisp</code>,
  etc.).  Type the <code>/join</code> command followed by a space and
  the channel name to join a channel and start posting and reading
  messages there.  It is also possible to search for channels by
  channel names.  For example, on Libera Chat, to search for all
  channels with "python" in its name, enter the IRC
  command: <code>/msg alis list python</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Although I have used Libera Chat in the examples above, there are
  plenty of other IRC networks too such as EFNet, DALNet, OFTC, etc.
  Libera Chat happens to be one of the very popular and active
  networks for open source projects and topic based communities.  I
  use it everyday, so I chose it for the examples here.  There are
  many tight-knit communities on Libera Chat.  Some of my favourite
  ones are <code>#commonlisp</code>, <code>#emacs</code>,
  <code>#python</code>, etc.  All of these have very nice and active
  communities with great attitudes towards beginners.

          <p>We‚Äôre Fly.io and we transmute containers into VMs, running them on our hardware around the world with the power of Firecracker alchemy. We do a lot of stuff with WireGuard, which has become a part of our customer API. This is a quick story about some tricks we played to make WireGuard faster and more scalable for the hundreds of thousands of people who now use it here.</p>
<p>One of many odd decisions we‚Äôve made at Fly.io is how we use WireGuard. It‚Äôs not just that we use it in many places where other shops would use HTTPS and REST APIs. We‚Äôve gone a step beyond that: every time you run <code>flyctl</code>, our lovable, sprawling CLI, it conjures a TCP/IP stack out of thin air, with its own IPv6 address, and speaks directly to Fly Machines running on our networks.</p>

<p>There are plusses and minuses to this approach, which we talked about <a href="https://fly.io/blog/our-user-mode-wireguard-year/" title="">in a blog post a couple years back</a>. Some things, like remote-operated Docker builders, get easier to express (a Fly Machine, as far as <code>flyctl</code> is concerned, might as well be on the same LAN). But everything generally gets trickier to keep running reliably.</p>

<p>It was a decision. We own it.</p>

<p>Anyways, we‚Äôve made some improvements recently, and I‚Äôd like to talk about them.</p>
<h2 id="where-we-left-off"><a href="#where-we-left-off" aria-label="Anchor"></a>Where we left off</h2>
<p>Until a few weeks ago, our gateways ran on a pretty simple system.</p>

<ol>
<li>We operate dozens of ‚Äúgateway‚Äù servers around the world, whose sole purpose is to accept incoming WireGuard connections and connect them to the appropriate private networks.
</li><li>Any time you run <code>flyctl</code> and it needs to talk to a Fly Machine (to build a container, pop an SSH console, copy files, or proxy to a service you‚Äôre running), it spawns or connects to a background agent process.
</li><li>The first time it runs, the agent generates a new WireGuard peer configuration from our GraphQL API. WireGuard peer configurations are very simple: just a public key and an address to connect to.
</li><li>Our API in turn takes that peer configuration and sends it to the appropriate gateway (say, <code>ord</code>, if you‚Äôre near Chicago) via an RPC we send over the NATS messaging system.
</li><li>On the gateway, a service called <code>wggwd</code> accepts that configuration, saves it to a SQLite database, and adds it to the kernel using WireGuard‚Äôs Golang libraries. <code>wggwd</code> acknowledges the installation of the peer to the API.
</li><li>The API replies to your GraphQL request, with the configuration.
</li><li>Your <code>flyctl</code> connects to the WireGuard peer, which works, because you receiving the configuration means it‚Äôs installed on the gateway.
</li></ol>

<p>I copy-pasted those last two bullet points from <a href="https://fly.io/blog/our-user-mode-wireguard-year/" title="">that two-year-old post</a>, because when it works, it does <em>just work</em> reasonably well. (We ultimately did end up defaulting everybody to WireGuard-over-WebSockets, though.)</p>

<p>But if it always worked, we wouldn‚Äôt be here, would we?</p>

<p>We ran into two annoying problems:</p>

<p>One: NATS is fast, but doesn‚Äôt guarantee delivery. Back in 2022, Fly.io was pretty big on NATS internally. We‚Äôve moved away from it. For instance, our <a href="https://fly.io/blog/carving-the-scheduler-out-of-our-orchestrator/" title="">internal <code>flyd</code> API</a> used to be driven by NATS; today, it‚Äôs HTTP.  Our NATS cluster was losing too many messages to host a reliable API on it. Scaling back our use of NATS made WireGuard gateways better, but still not great.</p>

<p>Two: When <code>flyctl</code> exits, the WireGuard peer it created sticks around on the gateway. Nothing cleans up old peers. After all, you‚Äôre likely going to come back tomorrow and deploy a new version of your app, or <code>fly ssh console</code> into it to debug something. Why remove a peer just to re-add it the next day? </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the vast majority of peers are created by <code>flyctl</code> in CI jobs, which don‚Äôt have persistent storage and can‚Äôt reconnect to the same peer the next run; they generate new peers every time, no matter what.</p>

<p>So, we ended up with a not-reliable-enough provisioning system, and gateways with hundreds of thousands of peers that will never be used again. The high stale peer count made kernel WireGuard operations very slow - especially loading all the peers back into the kernel after a gateway server reboot - as well as some kernel panics.</p>

<p>There had to be</p>
<h2 id="a-better-way"><a href="#a-better-way" aria-label="Anchor"></a>A better way.</h2>
<p>Storing bajillions of WireGuard peers is no big challenge for any serious n-tier RDBMS. This isn‚Äôt ‚Äúbig data‚Äù. The problem we have at Fly.io is that our gateways don‚Äôt have serious n-tier RDBMSs. They‚Äôre small. Scrappy. They live off the land.</p>

<p>Seriously, though: you could store every WireGuard peer everybody has ever used at Fly.io in a single SQLite database, easily.  What you can‚Äôt do is store them all in the Linux kernel.</p>

<p>So, at some point, as you push more and more peer configurations to a gateway, you have to start making decisions about which peers you‚Äôll enable in the kernel, and which you won‚Äôt.</p>

<p>Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if we just didn‚Äôt have this problem? What if, instead of pushing configs to gateways, we had the gateways pull them from our API on demand?</p>

<p>If you did that, peers would only have to be added to the kernel when the client wanted to connect. You could yeet them out of the kernel any time you wanted; the next time the client connected, they‚Äôd just get pulled again, and everything would work fine.</p>

<p>The problem you quickly run into to build this design is that Linux kernel WireGuard doesn‚Äôt have a feature for installing peers on demand. However:</p>
<h2 id="it-is-possible-to-jit-wireguard-peers"><a href="#it-is-possible-to-jit-wireguard-peers" aria-label="Anchor"></a>It is possible to JIT WireGuard peers</h2>
<p>The Linux kernel‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/WireGuard/wgctrl-go" title="">interface for configuring WireGuard</a> is <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/netlink/intro.html" title="">Netlink</a> (which is basically a way to create a userland socket to talk to a kernel service). Here‚Äôs a <a href="https://github.com/WireGuard/wg-dynamic/blob/master/netlink.h" title="">summary of it as a C API</a>. Note that there‚Äôs no API call to subscribe for ‚Äúincoming connection attempt‚Äù events.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs OK! We can just make our own events. WireGuard connection requests are packets, and they‚Äôre easily identifiable, so we can efficiently snatch them with a BPF filter and a <a href="https://github.com/google/gopacket" title="">packet socket</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the time, it‚Äôs even easier for us to get the raw WireGuard packets, because our users now default to WebSockets WireGuard (which is just an unauthenticated WebSockets connect that shuttles framed UDP packets to and from an interface on the gateway), so that people who have trouble talking end-to-end in UDP can bring connections up.</p>
<p>We own the daemon code for that, and can just hook the packet receive function to snarf WireGuard packets.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not obvious, but WireGuard doesn‚Äôt have notions of ‚Äúclient‚Äù or ‚Äúserver‚Äù. It‚Äôs a pure point-to-point protocol; peers connect to each other when they have traffic to send. The first peer to connect is called the <strong>initiator</strong>, and the peer it connects to is the <strong>responder</strong>.</p>

<p>For Fly.io, <code>flyctl</code> is typically our initiator,  sending a single UDP packet to the gateway, which is the responder. According <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/papers/wireguard.pdf" title="">to the WireGuard paper</a>, this first packet is a <code>handshake initiation</code>.  It gets better: the packet type is recorded in a single plaintext byte. So this simple BPF filter catches all the incoming connections: <code>udp and dst port 51820 and udp[8] = 1</code>.</p>

<p>In most other protocols, we‚Äôd be done at this point; we‚Äôd just scrape the username or whatnot out of the packet, go fetch the matching configuration, and install it in the kernel. With WireGuard, not so fast. WireGuard is based on Trevor Perrin‚Äôs <a href="http://www.noiseprotocol.org/" title="">Noise Protocol Framework</a>, and Noise goes way out of its way to <a href="http://www.noiseprotocol.org/noise.html#identity-hiding" title="">hide identities</a> during handshakes. To identify incoming requests, we‚Äôll need to run enough Noise cryptography to decrypt the identity.</p>

<p>The code to do this is fussy, but it‚Äôs relatively short (about 200 lines). Helpfully, the kernel Netlink interface will give a privileged process the private key for an interface, so the secrets we need to unwrap WireGuard are easy to get. Then it‚Äôs just a matter of running the first bit of the Noise handshake. If you‚Äôre that kind of nerdy, <a href="https://gist.github.com/tqbf/9f2c2852e976e6566f962d9bca83062b" title="">here‚Äôs the code.</a></p>

<p>At this point, we have the event feed we wanted: the public keys of every user trying to making a WireGuard connection to our gateways. We keep a rate-limited cache in SQLite, and when we see new peers, we‚Äôll make an internal HTTP API request to fetch the matching peer information and install it. This fits nicely into the little daemon that already runs on our gateways to manage WireGuard, and allows us to ruthlessly and recklessly remove stale peers with a <code>cron</code> job.</p>

<p>But wait! There‚Äôs more! We bounced this plan off Jason Donenfeld, and he tipped us off on a sneaky feature of the Linux WireGuard Netlink interface.</p>
<p>Jason is the hardest working person in show business.</p>
<p>Our API fetch for new peers is generally not going to be fast enough to respond to the first handshake initiation message a new client sends us. That‚Äôs OK; WireGuard is pretty fast about retrying. But we can do better.</p>

<p>When we get an incoming initiation message, we have the 4-tuple address of the desired connection, including the ephemeral source port <code>flyctl</code> is using. We can install the peer as if we‚Äôre the initiator, and <code>flyctl</code> is the responder. The Linux kernel will initiate a WireGuard connection back to <code>flyctl</code>. This works; the protocol doesn‚Äôt care a whole lot who‚Äôs the server and who‚Äôs the client. We get new connections established about as fast as they can possibly be installed.</p>

<p>We‚Äôve been running this in production for a few weeks and we‚Äôre feeling pretty happy about it. We went from thousands, or hundreds of thousands, of stale WireGuard peers on a gateway to what rounds to none. Gateways now hold a lot less state, are faster at setting up peers, and can be rebooted without having to wait for many unused peers to be loaded back into the kernel.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll leave you with this happy Grafana chart from the day of the switchover.</p>

<p><img alt="a Grafana chart of 'kernel_stale_wg_peer_count' vs. time. For the first few hours, all traces are flat. Most are at values between 0 and 50,000 and the top-most is just under 550,000. Towards the end of the graph, each line in turn jumps sharply down to the bottom, and at the end of the chart all datapoints are indistinguishable from 0." src="https://fly.io/blog/jit-wireguard-peers/assets/wireguard-peers-graph.webp"></p>

<p><strong>Editor‚Äôs note:</strong> Despite our tearful protests, Lillian has decided to move on from Fly.io to explore new pursuits. We wish her much success and happiness!&nbsp;‚ú®</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2024/03/freenginx-ngnix-web-server/">https://www.infoq.com/news/2024/03/freenginx-ngnix-web-server/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39688381">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								<p>Recently, a former employee of F5 and main contributor of the Nginx project announced the fork <a href="http://freenginx.org/">Freenginx</a> of the popular web server. The new project was started to <a href="https://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx-devel/2024-February/K5IC6VYO2PB7N4HRP2FUQIBIBCGP4WAU.html">address a security dispute</a> and wants to be a drop-in replacement of Nginx, run by developers rather than corporate entities. <a href="http://mdounin.ru/">Maxim Dounin</a>, formerly principal software engineer at F5, provides insights into the fork:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, some new non-technical management at F5 recently decided that they know better how to run open-source projects. In particular, they decided to interfere with the security policy Nginx has used for years, ignoring both the policy and the developers' position.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Originally developed by <a href="http://sysoev.ru/en/">Igor Sysoev</a> and currently maintained by F5, Nginx is open-source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, and media streaming. According to the <a href="https://www.netcraft.com/blog/january-2024-web-server-survey/">Web Server Survey</a>, even two decades after its initial launch, Ngnix remains the leading web server serving 23.21% of all sites. In a popular <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39373327">thread</a> on Hacker News, user <em>sevg</em> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39373804">points out</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Worth noting that there are only two active "core" devs, Maxim Dounin (the OP) and Roman Arutyunyan. Maxim is the biggest contributor that is still active. Maxim and Roman account for basically 99% of the current development. So this is a pretty impactful fork.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In his announcement on the <a href="https://mailman.nginx.org/mailman/listinfo/nginx-devel">nginx-devel mailing list</a>, Dounin highlights the <a href="https://freenginx.org/pipermail/nginx/2024-February/000007.html">initial dispute</a> that prompted Nginx to issue a security patch addressing two critical vulnerabilities. He adds:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am no longer able to control which changes are made in Nginx within F5, and I no longer see Nginx as a free and open-source project developed and maintained for the public good. As such, starting from today, I will no longer participate in Nginx development as run by F5. Instead, I am starting an alternative project, which is going to be run by developers, and not corporate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Freenginx is not the first fork and drop-in replacement for Nginx: <a href="https://github.com/webserver-llc/angie">Angie</a> was created by other Russian Nginx developers when F5 left Russia in 2020 and it is currently managed by the Russian company <a href="https://wbsrv.ru/">Web Server</a>. Diogo Baeder, lead backend developer at DeepOpinion, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7164034851187113984-YnaE/?">comments</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nginx is an incredible software and platform, but I was wondering if it wouldn't be time to just bite the bullet and create a more modern solution based on Rust. Having a solution that follows a similar model, "understands" the Nginx configuration language, and reaches similar performance levels, but with the memory safety and wide community adoption of Rust could lead to an amazing new project - perhaps even doing to Nginx what Nginx did to Apache HTTP.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Vincentz Petzholtz, network engineer and architect, is less optimistic and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vincentz-berlin_announcing-freenginxorg-activity-7164343754835931136-_GEM?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">adds</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes a fork is all you can do when a project is taken into a difficult direction. In the end, the users will vote with the adoption and install-base.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first release version is <a href="https://freenginx.org/en/download.html?utm_source=thenewstack&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_content=inline-mention&amp;utm_campaign=platform">Freenginx-1.25.4</a> under the same BSD license as Nginx. Dounin has provided access to a read-only <a href="http://freenginx.org/hg/nginx">Mercurial repository</a>, discarding for now the <a href="https://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx-devel/2024-February/YIFSHIYSKDFBYZ2QRA3WF6SRPGIBDBKI.html">option to migrate to GitHub</a>. The project started a new <a href="https://freenginx.org/en/support.html">developer mailing list</a>.</p>

<p><em>This manual supersedes TM 11-140, 10 September 1940</em></p></div>

<h2 id="SECTION_I">SECTION I<p>

GENERAL</p></h2>

<h3 id="Para_1">1. Purpose</h3>

<p>This manual provides instructions for proper breeding, care, and
training of the homing pigeon, and for the selection and training of
enlisted pigeoneers. With certain modifications this information can
be used by all pigeon units serving field forces, both in theaters of
operations and in the zone of the interior. Instructions in FM 24-5 for
units using the homing pigeon in communication have not been repeated.
The mission, function, and operation of a signal pigeon company and the
tactical employment of pigeons are described in FM 11-80.</p>


<h3 id="Para_2">2. Methods</h3>

<p>The methods prescribed in this manual are based upon experience.
Accordingly, if any new procedures are found by experience to improve
pigeon communication they should be submitted to the Chief Signal
Officer for consideration.</p>

<h3 id="Para_3">3. Origin and History</h3>

<p>The homing pigeon used by the Army for signal communication (referred
to in this manual as ‚Äúpigeon,‚Äù ‚Äúhoming pigeon,‚Äù and ‚Äúbird‚Äù) is a
distinct variety created through careful cross-breeding to obtain
maximum distance and speed in controlled and directed flight. Homing
pigeons are grouped in families or strains usually identified by
the names of the civilian pigeon fanciers who bred them for many
generations to develop certain characteristics of performance and
appearance. When the several varieties of pigeons used to breed the
modern homing pigeon actually originated is not certain. It is known,
however, that the following varieties existed in England and Belgium
before the nineteenth century, although the exact percentage and order
of their blend have not been determined: Smerle, Horseman, Cumulet,
Dragoon, Carrier, and Owl.</p>

<h3 id="Para_4">4. Nature</h3>

<p>The principle of using homing pigeons as messengers is based on their
instinctive attempt to return to their home lofts whenever they are
removed some distance and released. They will do this even with an
attached message or other light article. This desire to return is
largely based on natural urges of hunger and reproduction. Because the
pigeon has only one mate the reproductive urge is often the stronger.
These impulses can be stimulated by <em>controlled</em> feeding, mating, and
breeding without harming the pigeon‚Äôs health.</p>

<p><span><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span></p>

<h3 id="Para_5">5. Utility</h3>

<p>The pigeon‚Äôs usefulness to the Army is measured by the reliability
and speed with which it returns to its loft. Speed and reliability
are largely determined by the pigeon‚Äôs strain, physical condition,
training, and treatment. Therefore any lowering of standards for
these factors will be a serious handicap. Further handicaps are
discussed in <em>e</em> below. Section V sets minimum ability standards for
properly-trained, well-bred, healthy birds to be used by combat units
as message carriers.</p>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>Breeding.</span> Since physical characteristics and homing
instinct are usually inherited from the parents, records are maintained
for each pigeon. Then pairs are selected, mated, and allowed to produce
young birds on the basis of these records, plus other desirable
attributes described in section VI.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Condition.</span> The physical condition of a pigeon greatly
affects its performance. Therefore, study physical characteristics of
pigeons and enforce procedures prescribed in sections III and VII for
feeding, watering, and maintaining proper physical condition.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> <span>Training.</span> Training of the pigeon begins at an early age,
and is progressive and constant. The object is to settle the pigeon in
its home loft in order to develop reliability and speed as described in
section V.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> <span>Treatment.</span> The pigeon is highly sensitive and responsive
to kindness, firmness, reward for good performance, and calmness of
personnel handling it. Make the loft as attractive as possible because
the pigeon prizes its home.</p>

<p><em>e.</em> <span>Handicaps.</span> Bad weather, darkness, and injury, as well as
inadequacies in breeding, conditioning, and training, reduce efficiency
of pigeons (see <a href="#Para_9_c">par. 9<em>c</em></a>).</p>

<p>(1) <em>Bad weather.</em> This includes snow, fog, rain, and adverse winds, or
any other conditions which reduce visibility or oppose the flight of
the pigeon. Generally, flights may be predicted according to certain
atmospheric conditions as follows:</p>

<div>
<table summary="atmospheric conditions">
<tbody><tr>
<th><em>Conditions</em></th>
<th><em>Results</em></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Blue sky, high ceiling with white fleecy clouds, and low humidity.</p></td>
<td><p>Very fast speed.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Solid grey or bluish grey sky with
low ceiling, no clouds, and high humidity.</p></td>
<td><p>Very slow speed, losses may occur.</p></td>
</tr></tbody></table></div>

<p>(2) <em>Darkness.</em> Pigeons never lose their initial fear of flying at
night, but it is possible to train them to overcome this fear to a
great extent. Their natural instinct and intelligence will come to
their aid. Night operation, however, is considered impracticable for
the Army pigeons because of the highly mobile tactics of modern warfare.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Injury.</em> Injuries are commonly caused by improper handling,
predatory birds (such as hawks), enemy shellfire, or obstacles pigeons
strike in flight. Protect pigeons by destroying all hawks in the
vicinity of the lofts with shotguns provided for that purpose. Select
safe locations for releasing pigeons. Minor injuries rarely prevent a
homing pigeon from returning to its loft as long as they do not hamper
it from determining the proper course of flight. When vitally injured,
the pigeon will continue its return flight until physically exhausted.
Any injury which permanently impairs the eyes or wings of a pigeon
makes it unsuitable for any employment except breeding.</p>

<h2 id="SECTION_II">SECTION II<p>

DESCRIPTION</p></h2></div>

<h3 id="Para_6">6. General Appearance</h3>

<p>Pigeons must look healthy, well-balanced, alert, intelligent, and
showing abundance of rich feathers and sheen. Figure 1 shows the main
parts of the homing pigeon (the right wing is extended for ease of
description).</p>

<h3 id="Para_7">7. Weight</h3>

<p>A cock weighs from 14 to 17 ounces; a hen, from 13 to 16 ounces.</p>

<h3 id="Para_8">8. Plumage</h3>

<p>Rich, abundant, and soft plumage should cover the entire body. The
color itself is of no importance, but rich shades, with the checkered
pattern (if present) standing out brightly and distinctly, usually
indicate good health and satisfactory condition. For classification of
pigeons according to color see paragraph <a href="#Para_26">26</a>.</p>

<h3 id="Para_9">9. Head</h3>

<p>The head should be of a medium size, round or oval shaped, of broad
structure and strongly set. It should not be tight or drawn at any one
place.</p>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>Bill.</span> The bill should be of medium length with small
to medium wattles and set well into the head. No openings should be
noticeable when the bill is closed.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Eye.</span> See <a href="#SECTION_VI">section VI</a>.</p>

<p id="Para_9_c"><em>c.</em> <span>Ear.</span> The ear seems to play an important part in the
bird‚Äôs sense of direction. It includes three parts: external ear,
middle ear, and inner ear. At the top of the inner ear there are
three semicircular canals which appear to be the nerve conductors of
orientation. Although no one knows just what helps homing pigeons
find their loft, it is possible that the great sensitiveness of their
ears enables them to receive magnetic and atmospheric impression, and
thereby to determine direction either at departure or during flight.
This theory is based on the fact that atmospheric disturbances often
cause the bird temporarily to lose its way.</p>

<h3 id="Para_10">10. Neck</h3>

<p>The neck is of medium length, with no sign of dewlap at the throat. It
tapers to a wide, well-sprung chest.</p>

<h3 id="Para_11">11. Body</h3>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>Breast.</span> The breast (or chest) is broad and full in front;
depth of breastbone should not exceed the width.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Shoulders.</span> The shoulders are heavy and strongly
reinforced with muscles.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> <span>Back.</span> The back is well-feathered, strong, flat and broad
at the shoulders, narrowing toward the rump.</p>

<p><span><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>

<div id="fig_1">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p04.jpg" width="569" height="600" alt="TL70171"></p><p><em>Figure 1. Parts of homing pigeon.</em></p></div>

<p><em>d.</em> <span>Keel.</span> The keel is strong, arched in front, and of medium
length and depth. Width of keel denotes strength.</p>

<p><em>e.</em> <span>Abdomen.</span> The abdomen is reduced to the smallest
proportions.</p>

<p><em>f.</em> <span>Wings.</span> The wings must be medium-sized, strong,
well-proportioned, and rounded at the butt, with plenty of muscle.
Primary flights should be of a good width, with plenty of overlapping
space and a pronounced curvature towards the body. See <a href="#Para_11_i"><em>i</em></a> below.
Secondary feathers should also be long and wide to provide a good
covering for the entire back. Covert feathers should be sturdy and
abundant, because they supply additional wing strength, as well as
protect pigeons against adverse weather.</p>

<p><em>g.</em> <span>Pelvic bones.</span> The pelvic bones (or vent bones) are very
firm, close together over the vent, and extend toward the keel on each
side of the vent. These bones form a body girdle by which the legs are
joined to the body.</p>

<p><em>h.</em> <span>Rump.</span> The rump is wide and continues the line of the
back. It is well covered on all sides with fine, soft feathers.</p>

<p id="Para_11_i"><em>i.</em> <span>Tail feathers.</span> The tail feathers, 12 in number, are
short, wide, overlapping, and do not extend farther than ¬æ inch
beyond the wing tips.</p>

<p><span><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span></p>

<p><em>j.</em> <span>Legs.</span> The legs are of medium length and well muscled.
Thighs are chubby. Lower leg is red and stout, and toes are short with
firm nails.</p>

<h3 id="Para_12">12. Respiratory Channels (<a href="#fig_2">fig. 2</a>)</h3>

<div id="fig_2">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p05.jpg" width="439" height="600" alt="TL70172"></p><p><em>Figure 2. Respiratory channels of homing pigeon. (Air
sacs are named in accordance with McLeod and Wagers. Other names are
given in parenthesis.)</em></p></div>

<p>Respiratory channels are highly developed, enabling the pigeon to fly
continuously from 12 to 15 hours. Air circulates through the bronchial
tubes and lungs and also through nine air sacs, from which other small,
irregular cavities extend under the skin between the muscles, and even<span><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
into the inside of the bones. These small air sacs contain a reserve
of warm air which feeds the lungs during flight when the muscular
apparatus consumes a large amount of oxygen. They inflate and collapse
alternately, acting as a lift and force pump which renews air in the
lungs.</p>

<h3 id="Para_13">13. Digestive Organs</h3>

<p>Digestive organs of the pigeon are shown in figure 3 (for functions see
<a href="#Para_50_b">par. 50<em>b</em></a>).</p>

<div id="fig_3">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p06.jpg" width="474" height="600" alt="TL70173"></p><p><em>Figure 3. Digestive organs of homing pigeon.</em></p></div>

<h3 id="Para_14">14. Bloom or Milt</h3>

<p>This white, chalky powder is one of the means provided by nature to
protect feathers against moisture during flight. When the pigeon
bathes,<span><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a><br><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span> the bloom is deposited in the form of a white scum on the top
of the water. If a bird is caught and held closely, the bloom rubs off,
leaving a white substance on the clothes. Absence of bloom is a symptom
of poor health.</p>

<div id="fig_4">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p07.jpg" width="600" height="112" alt="TL70174"></p><p><em>Figure 4. A flight.</em></p></div>

<h3 id="Para_15">15. Molt</h3>

<p>Molting is nature‚Äôs way of shedding feathers and furnishing new ones
for the entire body. Thus, feathers lost or injured the preceding year
are replenished, and a perfect coat is insured for the coming year. An
imperfect molt indicates an unhealthy condition which will reduce the
pigeon‚Äôs efficiency and result in the breeding of inferior offspring.</p>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>Time of molt.</span> Every pigeon should molt once a year. Mated
pigeons start molting approximately 1 week after the second set of eggs
has been laid in the new season. Unmated old pigeons ordinarily begin
molting in May or June. The time young birds molt depends primarily on
the date of hatch. Those hatched during the early part of July begin
with head and neck feathers very soon after leaving the nest, and later
during the year partially molt all feathers. The process is completed
the following summer. Various influences hasten or retard molting. For
example, exceptionally warm weather may hasten it. Poor health retards
and may prevent a complete molt. Early breeding ordinarily hastens the
process, while late breeding tends to delay it.</p>

<div id="fig_5">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p08.jpg" width="600" height="576" alt="TL70175"></p><p><em>Figure 5. Tail feathers of homing pigeon.</em></p></div>

<p><span><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Order of molt.</span> Feathers are shed in the following order
(see <a href="#Para_16">par. 16</a> and <a href="#fig_1">fig. 1</a>):</p>

<p>(1) Primary flight No. <em>1</em> is shed first, and new feathers begin to
grow in its place.</p>

<p>(2) As soon as new feathers are one-half to three-quarters grown,
remaining primary flights are shed in numerical order.</p>

<p>(3) When flights Nos. <em>5</em> or <em>6</em> have been shed, molt spreads to neck
and shoulders.</p>

<p>(4) By the time flights Nos. <em>6</em> or <em>7</em> have been shed, the tail-molt
begins with feathers No. <em>2</em> (<a href="#fig_8">fig. 8</a>), then continues in the following
numerical order: <em>1</em>, <em>3</em>, <em>4</em>, <em>6</em>, and <em>5</em>.</p>

<p>(5) When the last flights have been shed, the molt is practically
complete, except for a few fine body feathers.</p>

<p><em>c. Care during molt.</em> The molt is a great physical drain on pigeons;
therefore, if practicable, hard flying and breeding activities should
be temporarily abandoned during this period. Exercise flights should
be only as long as is necessary for the pigeon‚Äôs health. When weather
permits, the birds should be allowed to bathe regularly, because this
will soften the skin and help feathers drop. The only sure method
of correcting an unsatisfactory molt is to restore the pigeon to
a healthy, vigorous physical condition. No attempt should be made
to aid the molt by plucking the next feathers in order, as in all
probability the new feathers will be inferior, or may not even appear.
The substance which creates new feathers is lacking in the sockets
for about 2 months after the molt is completed. During the molting
period, it is especially necessary that birds be fed rich, oily, easily
digested food such as grain (hemp, canary, flax or linseed) and greens.
This food will keep weight up to normal and insure a good growth of
feathers.</p>

<h3 id="Para_16">16. Varieties of Feathers</h3>

<p>Feathers grow in definite areas on the body. These feathered areas
or strips are known as pterylae. Bare spaces in between are called
apterylae. Feathers are divided into four types: contour feathers, hair
feathers, fluff feathers, and down feathers.</p>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>Contour feathers.</span> Contour feathers are large feathers
covering the pigeon‚Äôs body. When the bird is not in flight or excited,
they lie close to its body, normally overlapping and presenting a
smooth outer surface. The larger ones are the flight and tail feathers.
The average pigeon has 12 main tail feathers; on each wing there are
10 primary flights and 12 secondary flights. The bases of these large
feathers are covered by shorter feathers called coverts. These give a
rounded, smooth, and continuous line to the body.</p>

<p>The main tail feathers act as a rudder in flight, controlling the
bird‚Äôs direction. Flying is possible because every flight feather
overlaps, presenting a solid surface on the downbeat of the wing.
Besides, flight feathers provide lift and pull for the bird‚Äôs
propulsion. On the upbeat of the wing, the large flight feathers rotate
in such a manner as to cut through the air with little resistance, and
at the same time to permit escape of air.</p>

<p>The general structure of a contour feather can be best observed in a
primary flight from the wing or a large rectrix from the tail. The
stiff, hollow, cylindrical portion emerging from the skin is called
the quill. The bare quill proper extends only to the webbed portion
of the feather. It has a small hole (inferior umbilicus) at the end,
penetrating the skin.<span><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span> Nourishment for the feather passes through this
opening. The expanded portion of the feather, from the tip to the
quill, is known as the vane. The central portion of the vane, which
is called the shaft, is solid. Extending laterally from the shaft is
a web or webbing composed of barbs or rays. These rays are blade-like
in structure. The web of most feathers is generally wider on one side
of the shaft than on the other. The barbs are connected by a series of
cross structures called barbules which can be seen only with the aid of
magnifying lens. To see the barbs, however, apply a slight tension on
the webbing of the feather, causing it to spread apart. The invisible
barbules will split if too much tension is applied. Barbs can be
repaired so that little or no evidence of the split can be detected, by
stroking the feather between the index finger and thumb. Pigeons repair
a split in the barb by squeezing oil from the oil duct with their beak,
and then spreading it on the injured feather.</p>

<p>Feather textures vary greatly with the breed of the bird and the part
of the body from which they grow. When selecting homing pigeons, try to
select those with strong, firm feathers.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Hair feathers.</span> Also known as filoplumes, hair feathers
are hair-like structures interspersed among the regular body feathers.
They are so fine that they are usually overlooked.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> <span>Fluff feathers.</span> Sometimes called semiplumes, fluff
feathers are soft and fluffy because of the absence of a rigid feather
shaft and barbules in their web. The barbs are also long, soft, and
fluffy, and present a downy appearance. Fluff feathers grow only on
certain parts of the body.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> <span>Down feathers.</span> Down feathers are the soft, hairy, yellow
feathers on young pigeons. They are extremely fine, almost filamentous
in structure. These feathers drop off all through the period of
the young bird‚Äôs growth; a few, however, may remain after complete
feathering has taken place.</p>

<hr>



<h3 id="Para_17">17. Loft</h3>

<p>Pigeons are housed in lofts which may be buildings or vehicles designed
and equipped for that purpose. The loft includes all the equipment,
accessories and utilities necessary for the care of pigeons (figs. 6,
7, and 8). Perches are placed on the sides of loft walls. When a pigeon
is ‚Äúsettled‚Äù to a loft, that loft becomes its home.</p>

<p><em>a.</em> An <em>aviary</em> is the part of the loft where pigeons can be given
sunlight. It is usually built with wire netting on the sides and roof.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> The <em>trap</em> is a specially constructed opening which permits the
pigeon to enter but not to leave the loft. When a pigeon enters the
loft this way, it is said to have ‚Äútrapped.‚Äù A trap which permits the
pigeon to enter and leave at will is called an ‚Äúopen trap.‚Äù A landing
board is placed in front of the trap upon which pigeons alight when
about to enter the loft.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> A <em>settling cage</em> of wire which is built to fit over the roof and
landing board of the loft, is used to aid in settling and training
pigeons to trap.</p>

<h3 id="Para_18">18. Preparation of Loft to Receive Pigeons</h3>

<p>The first step in preparing to receive a shipment of pigeons is to
arrange for their housing. If it is the initial stock for a loft, the
entire loft will be available. In the case of subsequent shipment,
place new stock in a separate compartment for a period of observation.
In order to anticipate arrival of birds, maintain contact with the
agency making delivery. Then proceed as follows:</p>

<p><em>a.</em> Clean the loft.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> In good weather keep front of the loft open so that plenty of
sunlight and air can enter.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> To keep drafts out during extreme cold and windy weather, cover
openings of the loft with porous materials which will allow passage of
air and will not interfere with the camouflage appearance.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> Spread a small quantity of coarse sand on the floor of the loft to
aid cleanliness and to supplement the grit.</p>

<p><em>e.</em> Provide 10 percent more perching space than is necessary for the
number of incoming birds.</p>

<h3 id="Para_19">19. Receipt of Pigeons at Loft</h3>

<p>To receive pigeons at a loft, proceed as follows:</p>

<p><em>a.</em> Immediately upon their arrival transfer the birds to the loft from
the crates or baskets in which they were transported. The pigeons may
have completed a lengthy trip and be in comparatively poor condition
because of delays in travel or lack of proper care and attention.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> Immediately after the birds have been transferred to the loft,
carefully examine and handle each pigeon, separating the healthy
from the sickly. Place the healthy birds in a compartment where they
can obtain<span><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span> plenty of fresh drinking water, and feed them sparingly.
Isolate the birds which appear sick until they are fully recovered.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> It is imperative that the pigeons be vaccinated against pigeon pox
if they were not vaccinated prior to shipment.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> Thereafter water, feed, and provide bathing water according to
instructions in paragraphs 20 to 23, inclusive.</p>

<p><em>e.</em> Make an exact inventory of the pigeons, noting band markings,
colors, special markings, and physical condition of each bird.</p>

<p><em>f.</em> Become familiar with the pigeons while they are confined. Accustom
them to the presence of caretakers and to feeding at definite times.</p>

<p><em>g.</em> Begin training of the new birds immediately. The longer the time
between their arrival at their new home and the beginning of their
training, the more difficult it will be for them to be trained properly.</p>

<h3 id="Para_20">20. Watering</h3>

<p><em>a.</em> The health of a pigeon depends more upon pure drinking water than
upon any other factor; therefore, keep plenty of fresh water available
at all times.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> The homing pigeon does not drink like most other birds. The pigeon
places its bill into the water, and takes a long, deep draft like a
horse. For this reason, keep the depth of the water in the drinking
fountain not less than 1¬Ω inches deep. Always supply water in a
fountain or other receptacle which will prevent bathing. Fountains
PG-37-C provide excellent watering facilities for the birds and are
constructed to reduce contamination to a minimum (<a href="#fig_9">fig. 9</a>).</p>

<div id="fig_8">

<p><em>c.</em> In warm weather, change the water three times a day, cleaning
the<span><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span> container thoroughly each time. In cool weather, twice a day may
be sufficient, provided the water can be kept clean. Water containing
impurities gives the pigeon a sour crop or acute indigestion. If a
sanitary water supply is not readily available, use drinking water
purified for troops. When it is necessary to use water of doubtful
purity, add a sufficient amount of potassium permanganate until a light
pink color is attained. Empty drinking fountains at night in cold
weather so that the water will not freeze. Having running water in the
drinking fountain is not advisable as it is usually cool and may cause
diarrhea during hot weather.</p>

<h3 id="Para_21">21. Feeding</h3>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>General.</span> The health and general physical condition of
a pigeon largely depend on the amount of food, time of feeding, and
the kind of food provided. Pigeons should not refuse food unless they
have just been fed. They will be alert, active, happy, and much more
manageable if kept a little hungry. It is easy to overfeed pigeons
so that they become sluggish and listless. Many good pigeons have
been spoiled by overfeeding. The pigeoneer should hand-feed the birds
and watch them closely while they are eating because their appetite
reflects their general health and condition. Sick birds may be
discovered by their failure to eat. Pigeons become<span><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span> better acquainted
with the pigeoneer through hand-feeding, and he in turn can keep them
alert and under control.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Method.</span> Feed pigeons <em>twice</em> a day during training, light
feeding in the morning and heavier in the evening. After each exercise,
training, or other flight, call the pigeons into the loft and give them
a small quantity of feed as a reward. While the pigeons are taking
their morning exercise, clean the loft and place in it a fresh supply
of grit and drinking water. Call the birds in when they have completed
their exercises, then scatter the food slowly on the sand-covered floor
as the birds enter through the trap. Scatter the feed, a handful at
a time. Wait until the pigeons have eaten nearly all the feed before
distributing another handful. The feed should be well scattered so
that individual birds do not get all of the choice grains. No harm
is done if the pigeons eat some of the sand, providing it is clean,
as sand supplements grit as an aid to digestion. There are several
reasons why pigeons should be fed only a handful at a time. If the
whole amount of grain for one feeding is thrown on the floor at once,
the actual amount needed cannot be estimated exactly. If the amount
estimated was too little, the pigeons are underfed; if the amount was
excessive, the grain not immediately consumed becomes contaminated and
may cause sickness if eaten later. Another reason for scattering feed
in small quantities is to prevent the pigeons from picking out the
kinds of grain they particularly like and leaving those which contain
food elements they need for proper development. Pigeons always drink
immediately after feeding. When the first pigeon stops eating and takes
a drink, it is a sign that the pigeons have had enough food so do not
scatter any more grain.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> <span>Breeding pigeons.</span> Parent pigeons feed their young in
the nest by ejecting food from their own crops into the youngster‚Äôs
crop. Therefore, when young pigeons are in the nest, return in about
30 minutes after the initial feeding and offer additional food to the
parents. When the youngsters are approximately 18 days of age, start
placing a handful of grain each day in the back corner of the nest
compartment out of the way of the droppings. The parent pigeons will
eat a few grains in the presence of the youngsters. The youngsters will
imitate their parents and thus learn to eat by themselves more rapidly.</p>

<h3 id="Para_22">22. Pigeon Feed</h3>

<p>The diet for a pigeon should include legumes (peas and vetch), seeds,
cereal grains, green foods, and grit. The seeds and grains are fed
as an ordinary diet in the form of a feed mixture, but grit is fed
separately. Feed must be of a specific grade and mixture to assure the
pigeon of proper growth, a generally healthy condition, and enough
energy to endure the hardships of messenger flights. Pigeon feed, which
is a perishable item, must be grown under prescribed conditions from
the finest quality seed, harvested, cleaned, stored, and then mixed
when required. When harvested, grain or seed is likely to contain many
impurities like chaff, weed seeds, weevils, or other injurious insects,
kernels which are dead or damaged, and excessive moisture. Practically
all of these impurities must be removed before the feed is suitable
for use. Mixing must be accomplished under conditions that will insure
uniformity. The word ‚Äúfeed‚Äù as used below will refer to either mixed
feed, grain, or seeds, as applicable. A single grain or seed will be
referred to as a ‚Äúkernel.‚Äù</p>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>Suitable feed.</span> Feed should‚Äî</p>

<p>(1) Be sound and have a natural odor, without traces of sour, musty, or
foreign odors.</p>

<p><span><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<p>(2) Be well matured and of good natural color, without a noticeable
amount of dead or damaged kernels.</p>

<p>(3) Be free of dirt, dust, or foreign material, beyond a slight trace.</p>

<p>(4) Be free from live weevils or other insects and the defects caused
by them.</p>

<p>(5) Be free-flowing, without traces of webbyness.</p>

<p>(6) Not contain excessive moisture as determined by the field test
described in <em>b</em> (5) below.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Defective pigeon feed.</span> Defects in feed can be recognized
by smell, visual inspection, or laboratory test. Feed is unsuitable for
use if it has any of the following defects:</p>

<p>(1) <em>Unsound.</em> This condition may be detected by a sour or musty odor
or by an ‚Äúoff color‚Äù appearance.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Foreign materials.</em> Chaff, dirt, dust, stones, etc., can be
detected by visual inspection.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Webbyness.</em> When feed has been, or is infected, with injurious
insects it is likely to be webby. The feed will cling together in small
balls by webs similar to cobwebs. It may also have an objectionable
odor.</p>

<p>(4) <em>Dead or damaged kernels.</em> Kernels that have sprouted, been bored
by insects, or are discolored as a result of frost, fermentation, or
immaturity, can be detected by a visual inspection.</p>

<p>(5) <em>Moisture.</em> Small amounts of moisture cannot be detected without
a laboratory test. However, a field method which may be employed to
determine roughly the moisture content of feed is to place a few of
the kernels on a flat surface and then strike them a few times with
a hammer or similar tool. If the feed tested does not contain an
excessive amount of moisture, the kernels will crumble into small
pieces like ‚Äúcorn meal.‚Äù If an excessive amount of moisture is present
the kernels will become pulpy. When performing this test, remember that
hulled oats, flax seed, hemp seed, and vetch, because of their oil
content, will become pulpy even though their moisture content is within
required limits.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> <span>Harmful insects.</span> The two most harmful insects to pigeon
feed are weevils and grain moths.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Weevils.</em> Weevils are small beetle-type insects which vary in
color from brown to black. They eat by boring holes into the portion of
the kernel containing the nutritive elements. Weevils can be detected
by the test described in <a href="#Para_22_i_2_b"><em>i</em>(2)(<em>b</em>)</a> below.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Grain moths.</em> These small moths vary in color from buff to grayish
or yellowish brown. During the larva stage they gnaw their way into
the kernel and then eat the inside portion to secure nourishment for
growth. When fully grown they eat their way out of the kernel. The
presence of moths in feed can be detected by the holes they leave in
kernels.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> <span>Feed mixtures.</span> Various seeds and grains are mixed in
specified percentages to acquire a feed mixture of certain required
amounts of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Factors determining the
type of feed mixture used are climatic conditions, the way in which
the pigeon is used, and the condition of the bird. Different mixtures
are fed during the breeding and molting period, while training or
conditioning, or while the pigeons are used for messenger service. Use
of feed mixtures is as follows:</p>

<p>(1) <em>Breeding feed</em> is used to maintain a healthy physical condition
in parent pigeons, and at the same time supply essential food elements
necessary to raise strong young pigeons.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Training and conditioning feed</em> builds and maintains a physical
condition suitable for short distance messenger service during the
training period.</p>

<p><span><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span></p>

<p>(3) <em>Special feed</em> supplies energy and replaces the body tissues
consumed by the pigeon when it is continuously used for messenger
service.</p>

<p>(4) <em>Molting feed</em>, a supplementary feed mixture containing hemp,
canary, flax, and rape, insures good feathers and keeps the weight of
the pigeon normal by supplying rich, oily, and easily digested feed.</p>

<p><em>e.</em> <span>Analysis.</span> The three principal properties of feed that are
necessary for development and maintenance of a sound physical condition
are proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Proteins</em> contribute a large portion of the elements necessary for
maintaining the pigeon‚Äôs health, muscular and respiratory system, and
the organs essential to flying. The most important feeds in the protein
class are peas and vetch.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Carbohydrates</em> supply energy. The portion of carbohydrates not
used immediately changes to ‚Äúfat‚Äù and is held in reserve by the pigeon
to be drawn upon when it is being used continuously for messenger
service. The most important suppliers of carbohydrates are rice,
kaffir, wheat, corn, and hulled oats.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Fats</em> keep the pigeon warm and also build a reserve supply of
energy. The feeds which furnish fats are rape, flax, and hemp seed.</p>

analysis of the grains and seeds used for pigeon feed:</p>

<p><em>g.</em> <span>Green food.</span> Certain amounts of this food are essential
for the pigeon‚Äôs digestive organs to function properly. Crisp young
lettuce, kale (preferably curly), and chickweed are the best green
foods for pigeons. Pigeons prefer green stuff sprinkled with a little
table salt. While green food is in season, give the pigeons as much of
it as they will eat about three times a week. The preferred method for
feeding this type of food is to suspend it in bunches on the inside of
the loft about 4 inches from the floor.</p>

<p><em>i.</em> <span>Storage and fumigation.</span> Pigeon feed procured in
accordance with U.&nbsp;S. Army Specification 24-17-C, is of the finest
ingredients obtainable in accordance with U.&nbsp;S. Department of
Agriculture standards, and is processed prior to packing. If stored
properly this feed will not become contaminated. Improper storage,
however, counteracts the precautions taken to procure best quality
feed. Therefore, the instructions below have been prepared to safeguard
the original quality of the feed during storage.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Proper method of storage.</em> The larval, pupal and adult stages of
injurious grain insects are inactive in a temperature of 50¬∞ F. or
lower. Thus the first and the most important rule is to store feed in a
COOL, DRY PLACE, on a platform at least 6 inches above the floor.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) There are several simple methods of stacking bagged feed. One way
is to stand the first tier of bags on end on a movable floor of narrow
boards nailed to joists. Bags should be set far enough apart to admit
air and light. The air keeps the bags dry and the light discourages
rats. Other tiers of bags are laid flat, each tier at right angles to
the previous tier, to admit air and light (<a href="#fig_10">fig. 10</a>). A second method is
to lay a tier of bags flat on two parallel timbers, each tier laid at
right angles to the previous tier (<a href="#fig_10">fig. 10</a>).</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) After feed has been stacked, it must be protected against rats.
An inexpensive protective method is to construct a wooden framework
inside the building where the feed is to be stored, and to cover it
completely with ¬º-inch wire mesh. The size of the wire mesh inclosure
depends on the amount of feed to be stored.</p>

<div id="fig_10">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p20.jpg" width="600" height="260" alt="TL70180"></p><p><em>Figure 10. Methods of stacking bags.</em></p></div>

<p>(2) <em>Examination for contamination.</em> Feed stored in a hot climate or in
buildings where injurious grain insects are present is likely to become
infested.<span><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span> Therefore feed should be visually examined bimonthly for
presence of moths or adult insects.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Take the temperature of the feed by inserting a thermometer into
the feed, especially in the bags at the center of the pile. If it
exceeds 75¬∞ F. make a closer and more frequent examination.</p>

<p id="Para_22_i_2_b">(<em>b</em>) A simple and practical test to discover the presence of insects
is to place a quantity of the questionable feed in a sieve with
1/16-inch wire mesh (sieve PG-35), and shake over a white cloth or
paper. Examine screenings and if insects are present, fumigate the feed
according to instructions in (3) below to prevent further damage and
ultimate ruin.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Fumigation.</em> There are three methods for fumigating contaminated
pigeon feed available to pigeon units.</p>

<div id="fig_11">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p21.jpg" width="528" height="600" alt="TL70217"></p><p><em>Figure 11. Bath Pan PG-38.</em></p></div>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Quartermaster, fumigation and bath companies (T/O &amp; E 10-257)
have facilities, such as portable methyl bromide fumigation chambers,
for delousing clothing which may be used for fumigating pigeon feed.
These units are generally assigned to posts, camps, or stations and
to theaters of operations, and their services may be obtained. To use
their equipment,<span><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span> load chamber with bags of contaminated feed, seal,
and charge it with a 2-pound can of methyl bromide, Stock Number 51M892
(see Quartermaster supplement of the Federal Standard Stock Catalog).
Feed should remain in the chamber for at least 24 hours. Temperature of
the interior of the chamber should be maintained at a minimum of 70¬∞ F.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) If a portable fumigation chamber is not available, a building
which can be tightly sealed, like those used for training purposes
in the Chemical Warfare Service, may be used. The feed should be
loaded into the vault so that the entire floor space is utilized. Seal
vault tightly and apply methyl bromide from the outside of the vault
through a ¬º-inch diameter copper tubing at the top of the chamber.
The connection between the tubing and the methyl bromide container
should allow no leakage. The feed should remain in the vault for at
least 24 hours. The temperature of the interior of the vault should
be maintained at a minimum of 75¬∞ F. for best results. Use at least
1 pound of methyl bromide per 1,000 cubic feet of space. After the
24-hour exposure period, open vault and air it for a few hours before
removing feed. Methyl bromide is toxic to human beings. Therefore,
before opening or entering the vault after the exposure period, the
fumigator should wear a gas mask type M9A1, with a standard service
canister.</p>

<div id="fig_12">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p22.jpg" width="596" height="600" alt="TL70181"></p><p><em>Figure 12. Catching pigeon in loft.</em></p></div>

<p>(<em>c</em>) If a portable fumigation chamber or gas tight vault is not
available, ‚Äútarpaulin method‚Äù of fumigation may be used. Sweep clear
the floor<span><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span> (preferably cement) where the feed is to be placed for
fumigation. Stack the bags of feed in a square area to a height of 5
or 6 feet. After the feed is stacked, center four bags of feed in an
upright position on top of the pile to form a gas expansion dome. Throw
a tarpaulin which is large enough to cover completely the entire pile
of feed over the pile. Allow a minimum margin of 2 feet on the floor
for sealing. The tarpaulin should be of treated material, preferably
rubberized, to prevent leakage and to be impervious to the fumigant.
Seal the marginal excess of tarpaulin with filled bags or weights. The
fumigant is released from the container through a tubing extending from
the container under the tarpaulin to the top of the gas expansion dome.
The same type of fumigant, dosage, exposure, and temperature required
for vault or chamber fumigation are employed, and the same precautions
are observed when removing the tarpaulin after the exposure period. If
circumstances prevent a tight sealing of the tarpaulin use an increased
amount of fumigant to compensate for leakage.</p>

<p><em>j.</em> <span>Use and preparation of grit.</span> Grit is a prepared mixture
which serves as a mechanical grinder for the food in the pigeon‚Äôs
gizzard and assists in assimilation. Grit also purifies the crop and
supplies lime for bone building and forming of egg shells. Many grit
mixtures are available, most of which contain crushed oyster shell,
gravel, sand, small sea shells, crushed limestone, salt, charcoal, and
other ingredients.</p>

<p>(1) Between 5 and 10 percent of the food fed a pigeon should be grit.
Normally 5 percent is sufficient, except during the breeding season
when as much as 10 percent may be fed since the parent pigeons pump
grit into the youngsters when they start eating grains.</p>

<p>(2) A preferred grit is made as follows:</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Thoroughly mix (in the manner of mixing mortar) 20 pounds of
medium granite grit, 20 pounds of medium oyster shell, 20 pounds of
medium crushed limestone, 5 pounds of medium charcoal, and 1/8 pound
of oxide of iron (hematite). Then dissolve 3 pounds of table salt in
boiling water and add just enough of this solution to the mixture to
dampen it thoroughly. Do not add too much water. Thoroughly mix the
whole preparation and allow to dry before feeding to birds.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Each of the various ingredients in the mixture has a purpose. The
granite is a grinder and pulverizes the food; the oxide of iron has
a beneficial effect upon the blood and acts as a tonic; the charcoal
purifies the crop, acting as a stomachic, that is, strengthening or
stimulating action of the stomach. Limestone provides the materials for
strengthening the bones. The oyster shells contribute lime which enters
into the composition of bones and egg shells.</p>

<p>(3) The grit mixtures used are listed in the Signal Corps General
Catalog, as Stock Nos. 9A1321 (color red), and 9A1322 (color natural)
‚ÄúSeashell‚Äù or equal.</p>

<p>(4) Keep grit in the loft constantly except during the 24 hours before
the pigeons are to be sent away to a point 50 or more miles distant
for immediate liberation. Since grit contains salt and minerals which
cause thirst, pigeons might land en route for water, thereby losing
valuable time and exposing themselves to the danger of being shot or
captured. Place the grit in a wooden box designed so that the pigeons
cannot easily introduce foreign matter into the mixture. Inspect the
box daily and remove all foreign matter. Refill the grit container with
dry grit as needed. Once a week empty the grit container and clean it
thoroughly. Add a<span><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span> fresh supply and destroy the old grit. Always keep
an ample supply of grit in stock at the loft.</p>

<p><em>k.</em> <span>Allowance of feed and grit.</span> (1) The annual allowance of
feed mixture is 52 pounds for each pigeon because the average pigeon,
including those breeding and those not breeding, consumes 1 pound of
grain per week.</p>

<p>(2) The annual allowance of grit is 6 pounds a pigeon.</p>

<h3 id="Para_23">23. Bathing</h3>

<p><em>a.</em> No other class of fowl, except the duck family, enjoys a bath as
much as pigeons. Pigeons that are kept clean have less trouble with
mites or feather lice. The use of a quassia chip solution in the bath
water is excellent for keeping pigeons free from lice and should be
used once a week. To prepare the solution, boil one pound of quassia
chips in 2 gallons of water for 20 minutes. Strain off the liquid and
use 2 quarts of this solution to 3 gallons of bath water.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> As far as practicable, provide bath water daily during warm
weather but omit in freezing weather. Approximately 1 hour after the
morning feeding prepare the bath pan PG-38 and leave it in position
about 1 hour. Scrub the pan thoroughly after the pigeons have finished
bathing. During the breeding season provide the bath after the morning
feeding as usual, but on alternate days provide the bath in the early
afternoon. This method enables both cocks and hens to bathe every other
day (see <a href="#Para_44">par. 44<em>a</em></a>).</p>

<h3 id="Para_24">24. Catching and Handling</h3>

<p>Great care must be exercised when catching and handling pigeons because
their flying ability depends upon their physical condition, and awkward
and improper handling may result in the loss or breaking of tail and
flight feathers. The correct methods of catching and handling birds are
shown in figures 12 and 13.</p>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>Catching in crate.</span> To catch a pigeon in a crate or
container, gently force it to the corner or end of the container and
place palm of the hand in a firm position over pigeon‚Äôs shoulders (<a href="#fig_14">fig. 14</a>);
then turn the bird around<span><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span> (facing bird to door or entrance) and
gently grasp it between both hands for lifting from crate. Bring pigeon
to normal position in front of the waistline. Pigeons must be taken
head first from all crates to prevent injury to the feathers.</p>

<div id="fig_15">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p26.jpg" width="337" height="600" alt="TL70184"></p><p>(1) <em>Correct</em><span>(2) <em>Incorrect</em></span><br>
<em>Figure 15. Crating a pigeon.</em></p></div>

<p><span><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Catching in loft.</span> This should be done with great care
and ease as both the physical and feather condition of a pigeon may
be impaired by awkward handling. There are several good methods for
catching pigeons. The following one has been found to be satisfactory
when carried out properly:</p>

<p>(1) Always catch pigeons while in nests or on perches (<a href="#fig_15">fig. 15</a>).
Approach pigeon calmly, avoiding sudden movements that might frighten
it.</p>

<p>(2) Grasp bird by a quick movement of the hands. Catch it from the
front, with the thumbs on its back and fingers under its body.</p>

<p><b>Caution</b>: Never attempt to catch birds in the aviary, or when
they are flying about the loft.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> <span>Inspecting birds.</span> When examining the wings, back, or tail
feathers of a pigeon, always hold its chest or front portion against
your body (<a href="#fig_12">fig. 12</a>) for security. To examine the head, eyes, or bill,
place the bird properly in one hand using the other hand as a front or
side support, leaving fingers free for examination.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> <span>Crating birds.</span> Hold the bird with your thumb across its
back and its legs between your first two fingers; place the palm of the
other hand over the front part of the pigeon, extend fingers downward
in the direction of the keel (<a href="#fig_15">fig. 15</a>), and guide the bird into the
crate. Do not release until bird‚Äôs feet are firmly on crate floor.
Avoid crating birds with one hand only.</p>

LOFT MANAGEMENT AND RECORDS</p></h2></div>

<h3 id="Para_25">25. Routine</h3>

<p>A pigeoneer in charge of a loft can best care for his pigeons by
observing the following daily routine in loft management:</p>

<p><em>a.</em> Upon entering the loft, make a general inspection to see that
everything is in order.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> Sweep or scrape all sand and droppings and sift through a fine
screen. Add new sand and spread in a thin layer.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> Provide fresh drinking water (<a href="#Para_20">Par. 20</a>).</p>

<p><em>d.</em> Provide bath water (<a href="#Para_23">par. 23</a>).</p>

<p><em>e.</em> Conduct prescribed exercise and other training for pigeons
according to schedule. This may include all types of flights.</p>

<p><em>f.</em> Post loft records.</p>

<p><em>g.</em> Prepare daily quantity of feed and give prescribed portions.</p>

<p><em>h.</em> Inspect all pigeons as to condition, health, mating, breeding,
etc., whenever required.</p>

<p><em>i.</em> Carry out any special instructions given for the day.</p>

<h3 id="Para_26">26. Classification of Pigeon Colors</h3>

<p><em>a.</em> The color of the upper body and wings determines the principal
color classification of pigeons. In addition to principal
color classification (see <a href="#Para_26_b_1"><em>b</em>(1)</a> below), include the following
classifications when applicable:</p>

<p>(1) If any of the primary flights are white, the pigeon is classed as
a ‚Äúwhite flight.‚Äù Unless the flights are pure white the classification
‚Äúwhite flight‚Äù is not made.</p>

<p>(2) If all the coverts exhibit a light gray fringe on their outer
edges, presenting a checkered appearance rather than a solid color, the
pigeon is classed as ‚Äúcheckered.‚Äù</p>

<p>(3) When a pigeon has white patches of feathers on its head, it is
classed as ‚Äúpied.‚Äù If these white patches extend to its body, it is
classed as ‚Äúsplash.‚Äù</p>

<p>(4) If a pigeon exhibits one or two white feathers about the eyes, it
is classed as ‚Äútick.‚Äù</p>

<p><em>b.</em> Main color classifications for pigeons and their authorized
abbreviations follow:</p>

and Monthly Pigeon Loft Report.</p>

<p id="Para_27_a"><em>a.</em> <span>Breeding Card, WD SC Form 1132</span> (<a href="#fig_16">fig. 16</a>). The breeding
card is fastened on the outside of the nest compartment as soon as
the cock and the hen are mated and take possession of the nest. It
remains there during the breeding activities of the particular pair
of parent pigeons. The data provide the initial identification record
of the youngsters and permit a careful check on the progress of their

training flight (such as first, second) and the speed attained in
yards per minutes (YPM) or miles per hour (MPH). Speed is entered for
all flights if facts are available for calculation. When birds are
group-tossed, enter ‚Äúlate‚Äù for those failing to arrive at the loft with
the group. If birds break away and arrive at the loft in advance of the
group, note position of arrival (such as 1, 2, etc.).</p>

<p><em>d.</em> <span>Pigeon Pedigree Record, WD SC Form 68</span> (<a href="#fig_22">fig. 22</a>). The
pigeon pedigree record is kept for each pigeon used for breeding. Data
are taken from breeding and other pedigree records, and are entered as
follows:</p>

<p>(1) Name, color and sex, registry number (band number), date hatched,
by what loft bred, and flight record.</p>

<p>(2) Band numbers and color of parents.</p>

<h3 id="Para_28">28. Banding</h3>

<p><em>a.</em> Each breeding loft is furnished with identifying metal leg
bands to be used in banding all youngsters. These bands, PG-16, are
manufactured in pairs. Each pair bears the pigeon‚Äôs serial number.</p>

<p>(1) One of the pair of bands bears a marking which includes U*S, the
last two figures of the calendar year the bird was hatched, the letters
SC or AAF, and a serial number. This band is placed on the left leg and
indicates that the pigeon was bred by the United States Army. It should
not be removed as it serves to identify the pigeon with its breeding
record.</p>

<p>(2) The other band of the pair bears marking identical to that in (1)
above except that in place of the ‚ÄúU*S‚Äù it bears the letters ‚ÄúUSA.‚Äù
This band is placed on the right leg, and it means that the pigeon was
bred by and is the property of the United States Army. This band is
removed whenever the pigeon ceases to remain the property of the United
States Army.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> In addition to the banded pigeons bred and owned by the United
States Army, there are those of the United States Navy, and two large
national associations of civilian pigeon fanciers, the American Racing
Pigeon Union and the International Federation of American Homing Pigeon
Fanciers, as well as those of numerous smaller organizations. The
following examples illustrate the character of the legends used on the
bands:</p>

<p><span><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p><em>c.</em> When banded pigeons are lost in flight, their band markings are
listed on the Monthly Pigeon Loft Report (<a href="#Para_27_e">par. 27 <em>e</em></a>).</p>

<p><em>d.</em> Each loft is authorized to use various colored, spiral, celluloid
leg bands for special identification purposes. For example, all pigeons
in a particular compartment of each loft may be fitted with celluloid
bands of the same color to facilitate keeping track of them. These
bands, PG-15, are requisitioned in the following colors: red, yellow,
green, light-blue, dark-blue, black, and pink.</p>

<h3 id="Para_29">29. Loft Equipment</h3>

<p><em>a.</em> T/O &amp; E 11-39 prescribes the authorized allowances of
nonexpendable pigeon equipment for signal pigeon companies and is the
basis for requisition.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> Army Service Forces Catalog SIG 4-1, Signal Supply Catalog,
Allowances of Expendable Supplies, prescribes the authorized allowances
of expendable items for signal pigeon companies and is the basis for
requisition.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> The basis for other pigeon units to requisition equipment and
supplies depends upon the number of authorized pigeons they have and
their particular needs.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> Sufficient descriptive information of items must be indicated
on the requisition to permit positive identification. All required
information pertaining to allowances, supplies on hand, due in (on
requisition), and basis for issue must be clearly stated on all
requisitions submitted to the station signal property officer.</p>

<p><em>e.</em> In general, the following items of supplies and equipment in
varying numbers will meet normal requirements of pigeon lofts:</p>

<h3 id="Para_30">30. Message Holders</h3>

<p>Message Holder PG-67 consists of a body, cap, leg clamp, strap,
and fastener (<a href="#fig_23">fig. 23</a>). The body, cap, and leg clamp are made of
transparent plastic material.</p>

<p><em>a.</em> To attach message holder to pigeon, place leg clamp of holder,
around the aluminum identification band on the pigeon‚Äôs leg and secure
strap by means of the fastener. The message holder must always be
attached with the cap pointing in the direction of the pigeon‚Äôs body.
If attached with the cap pointing down it will interfere with the
bird‚Äôs walking. The aluminum bands must be loose enough on the pigeon‚Äôs
leg to allow the message holder to adjust itself to positions that will
not interfere with the bird‚Äôs flying. In emergencies, a message holder
may be placed on each leg.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> Pigeons to be used for signal communication should be trained with
the message holder attached to the leg to accustom them to carrying
it. Pigeons should be distributed to combat troops, with message
holders attached if it is known that the receiving troops have not had
training or experience in handling the birds. Otherwise, holders may be
delivered separately. Personnel of a loft should make every effort to
provide message center units being served with necessary information
concerning care, handling, and release of birds.</p>

<p><span><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>

<div id="fig_23">

<p><em>c.</em> To remove a message from a pigeon, catch the bird after it has
trapped; hold it in one hand, extend its leg, and remove the message
holder with the other hand. Release pigeon in loft.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> When it is necessary for a pigeon to carry a message and a message
holder is not available, fold message blank, attach it by looping it
around the leg band and tie its two ends together with a piece of
thread or light weight string.</p>

<p><b>Caution</b>: <em>NEVER WIND a string or rubber band around a pigeon‚Äôs
leg</em> because it will stop the circulation and may cause the pigeon to
lose its leg.</p>

<h3 id="Para_31">31. Responsibility for Training</h3>

<p>The commanding officer of a signal pigeon company, or the officer in
charge of a pigeon unit, will prepare a training program to serve as a
general guide for activities of the unit. Weekly training schedules for
the guidance of the enlisted personnel will be based upon this approved
training program for the unit.</p>

<h3 id="Para_32">32. Qualifications for Pigeoneers</h3>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>General.</span> Minimum specifications required for a pigeoneer
are‚Äî‚Äî</p>

<p>(1) <em>Skill.</em> That required for a basic private, plus the ability to
care for, feed properly, catch, and hold pigeons; to attach messages;
and to train birds for messenger service.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Knowledge.</em> That required for a basic private, plus a thorough
knowledge of capabilities, limitations, and habits of homing pigeons.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Personal traits.</em> A pigeoneer who is boisterous and of a turbulent
nature tends to frighten and upset pigeons and thus reduce their
effectiveness. The successful pigeoneer should possess‚Äî‚Äî</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) <em>Dependability.</em> To perform all his duties regularly and promptly.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) <em>Kindness.</em> To obtain confidence of the pigeons.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) <em>Patience.</em> To spend much time and repeated effort required for
training pigeons.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) <em>Neatness.</em> To maintain a sanitary and attractive loft for the
pigeons.</p>

<p>(<em>e</em>) <em>Firmness.</em> To enforce control over pigeons.</p>

<p>(<em>f</em>) <em>Power of accurate observation.</em> To note and learn
characteristics of individual pigeons in the loft by observing details
readily and accurately.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Basic training.</span> Only qualified basic privates are
selected for pigeoneer training. Skill and knowledge to be attained in
this course may be based on this manual.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> <span>Advance training.</span> Qualified pigeoneers who complete
basic training prescribed in <em>b</em> above, and who possess the ability,
may be selected for advance training which will prepare them to become
specialists or non-commissioned officers. This training will teach:</p>

<p>(1) <em>Skill.</em> (<em>a</em>) Ability to manage a training loft and to train both
young and old pigeons.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Ability to manage a breeding loft and supervise breeding
activities after schedules have been prepared.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Ability to instruct others in (<em>a</em>) and (<em>b</em>) above.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Knowledge.</em> A pigeoneer should possess a thorough knowledge of
loft management; feeding, training, and breeding of pigeons; and
employment of pigeon communications described in this manual.</p>

<p><span><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>

<h3 id="Para_33">33. Introduction to Pigeon Training</h3>

<p>It is almost impossible to prescribe any one method for training homing
pigeons. There are certain steps, however, that must be followed if the
birds are to give reliable messenger service. The methods for training
Army homing pigeons are prescribed in this section. However, they are
not the only methods by which birds can be trained. Success with the
birds depends largely on the individual pigeoneer‚Äôs experience and
technical knowledge. This is particularly true concerning operation of
combat lofts.</p>

<h3 id="Para_34">34. Settling Pigeons</h3>

<p>Settling is the process of conditioning a pigeon to return to its home
loft when released. Best results can be expected from young birds just
out of the nest because settling and resettling become more difficult
as the age of the pigeon increases. Many different methods are used to
settle pigeons to lofts, and no ironclad rules can be set down to cover
all situations. The age of the birds, type of loft, and experience of
the pigeoneer will determine the method used and success achieved. Two
settling procedures will be explained in this section. The first will
be for young birds not strong on the wing, and the second for older
birds that are strong on the wing. These procedures are general and
may be used, with slight variations, to settle birds to all types of
lofts. In the case of the combat loft, however, remember that pigeons
are trained to recognize a certain type of loft rather than terrain
features or geographic locations. A combat loft is moved daily during
training so that the birds do not become accustomed to one location.
Otherwise settling to a combat loft is the same as settling to any
other loft.</p>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>Settling birds not strong on wing.</span> The expression ‚Äúnot
strong on the wing‚Äù means that pigeons do not have sufficient strength
in their wings to stay in the air for sustained flight, for example,
youngsters removed from the nest when 28 to 36 days old. These young
pigeons are tame and easy to handle; they are not as excitable as older
birds because their sense of fear has not yet developed. For these
reasons they can be easily settled. They are not strong enough on the
wing, however, to stay away from the loft for prolonged periods.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Feed and water.</em> Feed birds liberally on the first day they are
placed in the loft, but never feed them heavily at any time after that.
Make sure the water fountain is placed where it can be found easily.
Young pigeons should be kept prisoners for about 2 days. During this
time watch them carefully to determine whether all have learned how to
drink. If any bird appears sleepy it may not have learned how to drink
or where to obtain water. This bird can be taught to drink by forcing
its entire beak into the water.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Learning to trap.</em> It is of the utmost importance that pigeons
used for delivering messages trap promptly. A bird may be the fastest
flyer in the loft yet be useless because it will not trap immediately
upon return to the loft. The message cannot be removed from the
pigeon‚Äôs leg if the bird stays on the roof of the loft instead of
entering the trap. For this reason it is essential that trapping
exercises be carefully carried out. The best time for this training
is when birds are being settled. Install the trap late in the evening
of the second day of confinement and allow the youngsters to go out
on their own initiative and look around. This enables them to become
familiar with the outside of the loft and the surrounding territory. On
the third day catch the youngsters, place them on the landing board,
and gently push one at a time through the trap. Some birds may take to
the wing but they will only stay in the air a few minutes<span><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span> at any one
time. These pigeons will not fly away; they are merely learning the use
of their wings and will return when tired. Place a small amount of feed
in the loft during this training and repeat the trapping exercise until
the youngsters overcome all fear of the trap. After the birds have
learned how to go through the trap allow them to remain outside the
loft for about ¬Ω hour and then persuade them to trap into the loft
themselves. The birds are especially nervous at this time and should
not be frightened. While persuading the birds to enter the loft, the
pigeoneer should give them a small amount of feed by hand, and at the
same time acquaint them with the feed call.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Exercising.</em> On the fourth and following days of training the
birds may be turned out morning and late afternoon for approximately
¬Ω hour of exercise. After each exercise period continue training the
birds to trap promptly upon their return to the loft. At this time
they should be fed only enough to assist in trapping. On these first
few days the pigeons may exercise singly or in small groups. On the
eighth day or soon after, however, most of the birds will begin to
take their exercise flights in one compact flock. As soon as they do
this, exercise the birds at noon as this will condition them faster
and also accustom them to flying during the heat of the day. If after
the seventh day there are a few birds that do not leave the loft for
exercise, induce them to fly by pushing them gently off the loft with
a bamboo fishing rod or similar pole. After all birds have learned to
exercise in a flock for ¬Ω hour or more and then return to the loft
they may be considered settled. They are now ready for their first
training tosses (<a href="#Para_35">par. 35</a>).</p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Settling birds strong on wing.</span> The following method is
suggested for settling pigeons that are 36 days of age or older. It is
assumed<span><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span> that these birds have been trained to trap and that they are
familiar with the feed call. If they have not been taught to trap, then
such training must be carried on in conjunction with this method of
settling. It is necessary to use a wire inclosure such as a settling
cage in teaching these birds to trap because they will fly away if not
confined.</p>

<div id="fig_26">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p48.jpg" width="425" height="600" alt="TL70195"></p><p><em>Figure 26. Hand-feeding pigeons in loft.</em></p></div>

<p>(1) <em>Hunger and tameness.</em> These are the two most important factors in
settling birds strong on the wing, and the extent to which they are<span><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
developed and controlled will greatly determine the speed with which
the pigeons can be settled.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) <em>Hunger.</em> Never feed pigeons a full ration of feed at any one
time during the settling period. Keep them definitely on the hungry
side at all times. This serves to impress upon them that the loft is
the place to find food. Hand-feeding will control the distribution
of feed and, at the same time, encourage the birds to become tame.
Pigeoneers are urged to hand-feed their birds at all times if possible.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) <em>Tameness.</em> The pigeoneer should spend as much time as he can
in the loft with the birds. The loft should be arranged so that the
birds will be near the pigeoneer. This will serve a double purpose: the
pigeoneer becomes better acquainted with his birds, and they in turn
lose all fear of him.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Confinement.</em> It may be necessary to confine these birds for
several days, depending on their age. A settling cage to fit on the
landing board and roof of the loft may be constructed from wood and
wire mesh (<a href="#fig_27">fig. 27</a>). This confines the pigeons, but at the same time
allows them to become acquainted with the roof, landing board, trap,
and immediate territory around the loft. The qualified pigeoneer can
anticipate by the tameness, hunger, and actions of the birds, when they
are ready to be given their first freedom.</p>

<p>(3) <em>First freedom.</em> Days with overcast skies or light rains are most
favorable for first releasing the birds. Best results can be expected
if birds are released in the late afternoon when they are hungry. When
the pigeoneer determines that the birds are ready to be given their
freedom, or on the third or fourth day of settling at the new location,
the following procedure is observed:</p>

<p>Force all of the pigeons into the settling cage, except for three
or four birds chosen in advance for their tameness. Give this small
group of birds their freedom. Pigeons love company; therefore, after
taking to the air, these birds will usually be attracted back by the
remaining birds in the settling cage. After the pigeons circle the loft
a few times call them in to prevent them from straying. For this first
liberation move the settling cage on the loft far enough to one side
to expose approximately half of the trap. This permits the pigeons to
enter the loft as soon as they return.</p>

<p>When the first group returns satisfactorily, give another small group
their freedom. The number of birds in the subsequent groups may be
increased if satisfactory results are obtained with the first few
groups. If the first group, or any part of it fails to return, however,
no other birds should be given their freedom that day. Repeat this
procedure the following day.</p>

<p>At no time during the first 2 days of liberty should the entire flock
be given its freedom at one time. After approximately 50 percent of the
birds has been given their liberty one or more times, the entire flock
may be given open loft and permitted to go in and out at will during
the late afternoon. Give open loft again the next day at the same time.
On subsequent days allow the birds their freedom each morning and
evening for approximately ¬Ω hour of exercise.</p>

<p>Any birds that fail to take to the air should be gently forced to
exercise. Noon exercise periods will accustom birds to flying in the
heat of the day. When all birds have learned to exercise freely in a
flock and then return to the loft they are considered settled and ready
for further training as message carriers.</p>

<p><span><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<div id="fig_27">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p50.jpg" width="600" height="349" alt="TL70196"></p><p><em>Figure 27. Settling cage for loft, PG-68/TB.</em></p></div>

<p>(4) <em>Summary.</em> These essential points are to be remembered in settling
young pigeons:</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Teach birds to enter loft immediately after each exercise flight.
Loitering outside may become a fixed habit which will make the birds
undesirable for messenger service.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Never drive pigeons from the loft during the first few days of
settling.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Be sure pigeons are exercised and fed <em>regularly</em>.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) Keep birds as tame as possible and do not overfeed them.</p>

<p>(<em>e</em>) At no time allow the birds to become frightened.</p>

<p>(<em>f</em>) Do not interpret these instructions on settling as ironclad
rules. It may be necessary to vary them from time to time, depending
upon the situation.</p>

<h3 id="Para_35">35. Training for Messenger Service</h3>

<p>This training is started as soon as the birds have been settled to the
loft from which they will be distributed. All pigeons except those
specifically reserved for breeding purposes may undergo training
continuously from the time they are 28 days old until they are no
longer suitable for messenger service. Fundamentally, the methods for
training pigeons to mobile combat lofts are the same as those for
stationary lofts. To avoid confusion, any difference in method will be
noted in the following paragraphs.</p>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>Conditioning.</span> The first step in training homing pigeons
for messenger service is to develop the health and strength necessary
to endure sustained flight. This process is called conditioning. The
degree of training necessary to condition the birds will vary with the
mission for which they are being trained. Birds that will be required
to fly long distances will necessarily be given longer and more
intensive training than birds that will be required to fly only short
distances.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Health</em> of the pigeon is dependent on proper care. Overcrowding
of birds should be avoided at all times. Good loft sanitation and
ventilation, together with proper diet and uncontaminated drinking
water, are factors in health that are under the control of the
pigeoneer. He is therefore largely responsible for the over-all health
of pigeons in his loft.</p>

<p><span><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<div id="fig_28">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p51.jpg" width="367" height="600" alt="TL70197"></p><p><em>Figure 28. Releasing pigeons from Crate PG-49.</em></p></div>

<p><span><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span></p>

<p>(2) <em>Strength</em> is developed by exercise flights around the loft, and by
training flights made from distant points.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Training flights.</span> Pigeons may be given training flights
in groups, in pairs, or singly. This training procedure is sometimes
called ‚Äútaking the birds down the road for a training toss.‚Äù</p>

<p>(1) <em>Group tossing.</em> Three or more birds are released at one time.
Young birds are gregarious and will work more satisfactorily when
released in small groups rather than individually. For this reason
birds being given their first training flights should be group tossed.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Double tossing.</em> A flock of pigeons is released in pairs; each
pair is permitted sufficient time to disappear before the next pair is
released.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Single tossing.</em> One bird at a time is released and permitted
to return to the loft alone. This is valuable training and all birds
should be given two or more single tosses of 10 or more miles before
being used in messenger service. Single tossing should not be practiced
at distances in excess of 10 miles until the pigeons have been well
settled in a particular location.</p>

<p>(4) <em>Use of cage PG-50 in training.</em> Preliminary training of pigeons
should include several brief periods of confinement in the 10-bird
training cage PG-50. After a period of confinement open doors carefully
and allow the birds to emerge of their own free will. The release point
should be within sight of the loft.</p>

<p>(5) <em>Use of pigeon equipment PG-103/CB and PG-105/CB.</em> Pigeons to be
used for carrying messages should be released from these 2- or 4-bird
containers after a brief interval of confinement. This will accustom
them to the boxes before combat use. Make sure fresh water is available
for the birds during confinement period.</p>

PG-103/CB.</em></p></div>

<p><em>c.</em> <span>Advanced training flights.</span> Advanced training of military
pigeons is primarily directional flight training, that is, releasing
training pigeons to fly back in one general direction from various
distances along the same course. The course may be north, south, east
or west as determined by the location of the loft in relation to
the point of release. Directional flights are the most suitable for
military use, since speed and reliability of the bird are considerably
increased and the time involved in training is comparatively short.
If properly trained, however, pigeons will return to their loft
from reasonable distances in any direction. A return flight from a
direction different from the trained line of flight would be called
a nondirectional flight. The speed from nondirectional flights will
usually be slower and less reliable than from directional flights.
This is particularly true when the pigeon must fly from the opposite
direction of the trained line of flight. For nondirectional flights
to be reliable, pigeons should be given training tosses from varying
distances from all points of the compass. Since this type of training
is not stressed in the Army Pigeon Service the subject will not be
discussed any further.</p>

<p><span><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span></p>

<div id="fig_31">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p54.jpg" width="471" height="600" alt="TL70200"></p><p><em>Figure 31. Pigeon Equipment PG-105/CB, containing
pigeons.</em></p></div>

<p>(1) <em>Directional training to stationary lofts.</em> The stationary loft
training chart (<a href="#fig_32">fig. 32</a>) will aid the pigeoneer in directional training
of pigeons when the loft is in a permanent location. During training,
flight speeds will average 30 miles an hour from distances of 13 miles
or more if a direct line of flight is followed. When the training
flights (<a href="#fig_32">fig. 32</a>) have been completed, the speed of pigeons will
usually be faster than 37¬Ω miles an hour. To maintain this speed
approximately once a week give pigeons one flight from 40 to 50 miles
and two or more short flights from 15 to 20 miles. Such flights will
keep the birds in condition for messenger service from distances up to
125 miles. Any bird returning in bad condition will be benefited more
by a rest of 3 or more days than by further training. If birds exceed
40 miles an hour on their first training flight from release<span><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span> points
of 13 miles or more, they may be failing to observe variations in
topography. Therefore, to be conservative during this training period,
release them again from the same point in order that they may learn
thoroughly the physical characteristics of the region over which they
fly. This second liberation from the same point greatly assists in
avoiding losses at future liberating points from greater distances. A
second liberation is also recommended if the birds return at speeds of
less than 20 miles an hour, since it can be assumed that they did not
follow a direct line of flight. A second flight over the same course
gives the birds an opportunity to learn a more direct line of flight.
Unless adverse weather conditions exist, pigeons generally continue to
fly in a direct line once it is learned. Strong head winds and the need
to fly around local storms will slow the birds down.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Directional training to combat lofts.</em> Combat (or mobile) lofts
are used during combat when it is necessary to establish immediate
pigeon communication. Since pigeons may be required to furnish reliable
messenger service within 8 days after moving to a new location, their
training must be carefully planned and skillfully accomplished.
Flight training begins as soon as the loft is established near the
headquarters to be served. Until this time, however, the birds are
not given any training tosses. They are, of course, fully settled
to the loft and have been taking daily exercise flights around the
loft at each new location to which the loft has been moved. Give the
birds their first exercise flight shortly after establishing the new
location. After the birds have had a brief rest they are given their
first training toss. If weather permits, group toss the birds many
times each day thereafter. Increase the distance and reduce the size
of<span><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span> the group each day so that the birds may be trained to distances of
25 to 50 miles in 5 days. When giving this flight training, follow the
combat loft training chart shown in figure 36.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> <span>Remobile training.</span> (1) <em>Remobiling.</em> After combat birds
have been moved into a stationary position and have been flown from
this location, it is desirable to train them to mobility again before
moving them into a new location. This process is called remobiling
and can best be accomplished by moving the loft only a few feet at a
time until the pigeons again become accustomed to having it moved.
The birds will seem quite nervous and a few may settle on the ground
or fail to enter the loft the first few times it is moved. The birds
should become accustomed to searching for the loft regardless of its
location. After this stage of training has been reached, the loft
should be moved farther and farther away from the old location. Work
the pigeons as a regular mobile team from this point on, always making
sure that the birds are allowed plenty of time in the settling cage
before they are released. This process of remobiling homing pigeons
can best be accomplished with young birds that have not been settled
in one location for more than 6 weeks. If there is a shortage of young
birds and it is necessary to use older birds which have been remobiled
numerous times, transport them to the new location as many times as
possible. Feed the birds at the new location and never at the old home
loft. The birds will thus learn to retrace their flight to the new loft
if they return to their previous location. This method is useful only
when the new location is known in advance. Birds that fail to perform
properly as message carriers and are unsuitable for breeding purposes
should be destroyed. Birds showing symptoms of sickness should be
removed from the loft and forwarded for hospitalization, or destroyed
if hospitalization facilities are not available.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Reestablishing new location.</em> If the tactical situation requires
the message center to be moved forward, a new loft with birds that
have been trained in mobility will be placed in the new location. The
old loft may continue to operate until the new loft has established
reliable communication. This method of operation insures continuous
message service. As soon as the new loft has established reliable
message service, the old loft will be removed, and if the birds are
still suitable for combat loft flying the loft will be remobiled. If
the birds are no longer suitable for combat flying because of numerous
resettling at different locations, or from being settled in one
location too long, they may be returned to the base camp and put in one
of the breeding sections. The combat loft will then be restocked with
new youngsters from the breeding lofts and training in mobility will
begin.</p>

<p><em>e.</em> <span>Training precautions.</span> (1) <em>Overtraining.</em> Care should be
taken during flight training not to overtrain the birds. Such training
does more harm than good, particularly if long distances are involved.
Overtraining can be detected by the slightly dizzy, sleepy, and
unbalanced appearance of the birds while resting. When this condition
occurs, allow the pigeon to rest for a few days with open loft but no
forced exercise.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Feed mixtures while training.</em> The birds should have access to
fresh water and grit at all times. Make sure that the feed is clean
and in the best possible condition. Never change the mixture during
training or while the pigeons are being used for messenger service
because the change will throw the birds out of condition.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Training losses.</em> Forcing the birds to undertake distant flying
before they become properly settled to a location causes frequent
losses<span><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span> during the training stage. Care should be taken to limit the
first few training flights to distances of approximately 1 mile or less.</p>

<p>(4) <em>Catching pigeons.</em> The pigeoneer should avoid quick or sudden
movements in the loft and should never chase the birds in order to
catch them. When it is necessary to catch pigeons during daylight
hours, close the blackout windows or insert the shutters to darken
the loft. The pigeons may then be picked up easily with the aid of a
flashlight. The pigeoneer should avoid catching the pigeons in the loft
immediately after their return from a training flight.</p>

<h3 id="Para_36">36. Delivering Pigeons by Parachute</h3>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>Equipment.</span> Parachute equipment PG-100/CB consists of a
collapsible, cylinder-type, 4-bird container and a 6-foot hemispherical
baseball-type parachute with a quick release clip. Parachute equipment
PG-101/CB is of similar design except that the container has an 8-bird
capacity and is attached to a 9-foot parachute. This equipment is
specifically designed to supply initially or to resupply pigeons to
infantry parachute troops, infantry glider troops, or any isolated
forces requiring delivery of pigeons by air.</p>

<p><span><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span> The instructions printed on each parachute pack should be
strictly adhered to.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> <span>Results.</span> Best results will be obtained when pigeons are
launched between the altitudes of 200 and 1,000 feet with air speed
not exceeding 125 miles an hour. Pigeons launched within these general
limits are less likely to become lost because of excessive drift. The
possibility of injury to the birds from high speed air rushing through
the container, or from shock when the parachute opens, will be reduced
to a minimum.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> <span>Instructions for repacking parachutes.</span> The following
method is suggested for repacking either 6- or 9-foot parachutes for
future use after they have been used once for dropping pigeons to
ground troops.</p>

<p>(1) Stretch parachute full length, with one man holding the canopy
at the center of the top and another man holding the shroud lines
taut at the shroud line separator disk. Straighten all shroud lines,
making sure none are twisted. Lay the parachute on a flat surface and
pick each fold of the canopy as one would pick petals from a flower,
dividing the folds and associated shroud lines equally on each side
(<a href="#fig_35">fig. 35</a>). Eliminate creases by running the hand between the folds.</p>

<p>(2) Make an ‚ÄúS‚Äù fold in the canopy lengthwise from the crown (<a href="#fig_36">fig. 36</a>).
The hem will form a large letter ‚ÄúS‚Äù if the fold is made properly.</p>

<p>(3) Lay the shroud lines in small ‚ÄúS‚Äù folds on the canopy starting
approximately 10 or 12 inches back from the hem, making a sufficient
number of folds to bring the shroud line separator disk close to the
hem of the canopy. The parachute is now ready to be folded into a pack.
To do this, make three accordion folds in the canopy (<a href="#fig_37">fig. 37</a>).</p>

<p>(4) Tie the folded canopy in position with two tie cords of not more
than 15 pounds strength. Place one cord approximately 2¬Ω inches
back from the hem and the other cord 2¬Ω inches from the end of the
pack. Attach the static line to the tie cord near the end of the pack,
leaving enough tail for another tie to be made to the other tie cord
near the hem with 3 inches of slack left between the two ties (<a href="#fig_38">fig. 38</a>).
The static line must have a tensile strength of at least 200
pounds and be 15 feet long. The 3 inches of slack left between the two
ties are necessary for each tie cord to receive a sharp individual
snap; otherwise both cords will break simultaneously.</p>

<p>(5) Push the remainder of the static cord between one of the folds in
the parachute. The parachute is now ready for reuse.</p>

MATING AND BREEDING</p></h2></div>

<h3 id="Para_37">37. Mating</h3>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>General.</span> Pigeons will keep the same mate for life unless
forcibly separated. The desire to mate is a natural instinct. Since
pigeons are monogamous their mating can be controlled for breeding
purposes. If left to their own inclinations, pigeons will mate between
the ages of 4 and 9 months. Mating for breeding purposes, however,
should not be permitted until pigeons are at least 9 months of age.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Purpose.</span> The aim in mating is to produce youngsters which
are equal, if not superior, in ability, to either of the parents. Such
youngsters are obtained by selecting breeder stock with pedigree,
performance, physical qualities, and temperament which will probably
produce youngsters of the required type.</p>

<h3 id="Para_38">38. Sex</h3>

<p><em>a.</em> Sex of the pigeon is difficult to determine without experience;
however, some external characteristics help recognition. Under ordinary
circumstances the cock usually has‚Äî</p>

<p>(1) Broader skull.</p>

<p>(2) Larger head.</p>

<p>(3) Larger bill and wattle.</p>

<p>(4) Stronger neck.</p>

<p>(5) Broader shoulders.</p>

<p>(6) Closer vent bones.</p>

<p>(7) Larger legs and feet.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> In some cases, where the physical characteristics of the male and
female are similar, it is often necessary to observe their actions when
together to determine sex. Some of the common actions of the cock are:</p>

<p>(1) Chasing hen when cooing.</p>

<p>(2) Scraping of the tail when cooing.</p>

<p>(3) Pecking the head of the hen when she shows no desire to mate.</p>

<p>(4) Cock‚Äôs coo is deep and full, while hen‚Äôs is sharp.</p>

<h3 id="Para_39">39. Selection of Stock</h3>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>General.</span> Stock for breeding at a loft should be selected
with the advice of the pigeon expert in charge of breeding. The
pigeoneer who desires to become an expert in the art of breeding
pigeons is encouraged to study additional literature on this subject.
The pedigree for at least two generations is used to determine probable
qualities of future youngsters since it shows family, strain, and kind
of flying in which the birds excel, as well as the performance of other
youngsters produced by the same parent.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Physical qualities.</span> Pigeons selected for breeding should
be in good health and as nearly perfect physically as possible. A
pigeon which<span><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span> has had a serious injury, or has been very ill, is
unsuitable. The following physical qualities are desirable:</p>

<p>(1) <em>Feathers.</em> Feathers should be of good quality. Flights, which are
most important, should be heavy and wide, and should overlap when the
wing is extended, showing no gaps. Birds with very thin flight should
not be bred. Body feathers should be soft and plentiful. Those on neck
and chest should be glossy and iridescent.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Eye.</em> The eye is complex and is of great importance. It should
never be of a sunken or extended nature, but should completely fill
the orbit (bone cavity containing the eye) and be surrounded by a fine
white textured cere. The eye should be clear and bright; its color is
of no importance. The eye may be best examined with a magnifying glass.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) The pupil is approximately one-third the size of the eye. It
dilates and contracts according to intensity of light and distance of
object being focused. The pupil should be black and brilliant.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) A thin visible muscle (often called the scouting sight) should
completely encircle the pupil. This muscle dilates and contracts the
pupil. A portion of the muscle may be of a darker shade and located
either at the front or lower front of the pupil. This muscle should
be prominent in at least one of the birds selected for breeding to
produce a higher percentage of dependable birds. If pigeons which do
not possess this muscle, or which have only a small portion of it
visible, are to be used for breeding purposes, they should be mated to
pigeons having a muscle which is more prominent even though it may not
completely surround the pupil.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) The iris determines the color of the eye. It should be well
blended and possess the brilliance denoting life and observance.
Pigeons possessing faded or weak eyes are not desirable for breeding
purposes.</p>

<p>Splashed birds often possess a ‚Äúbull eye‚Äù which has an iris of a solid,
dark purplish-brown color. When this color appears only on a part of
the iris, the bird has a splashed eye. It is hard to detect the muscle
surrounding the pupil when the ‚Äúbull eye‚Äù is present.</p>

<p>The color of the iris may be maroon, ruby-red, rose, pink, walnut,
chestnut-brown, orange, yellow-orange, carrot, violet, grayish white,
or pearl. When the iris consists of one color only, it will be
considered a ‚Äúfull eye.‚Äù Two colors may occasionally be present in the
iris, such as red and yellow, orange and yellow, and so forth. The two
colors should be well blended in any case. ‚ÄúFull eyes‚Äù and ‚Äútwo-colored
eyes‚Äù are both satisfactory for breeding purposes. Mated birds should
have irises of similar shades.</p>

<p>The outer part of the iris is normally darkest; the color diminishes
toward the center of the eye. This coloring is more pronounced when the
birds are in top condition.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) The thin line circumscribing the iris should be extremely dark
and very distinct.</p>

<p>(<em>e</em>) The remainder of the eyeball should be dark and well covered by
the cere. The bird is said to have an ‚Äúopen eye‚Äù when the portion of
the eyeball which should be covered by the cere is visible. Birds with
open eyes are undesirable for breeding.</p>

<p>(<em>f</em>) The upper and lower lids are a part of the eye cere. A third lid
which is a transparent membrane frees the eye from foreign material.
The blinking of the third lid can scarcely be detected when the pigeons
are in perfect health.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Size and temperament.</em> Medium-sized pigeons are most desirable and
birds should be mated to attain this uniform size. Birds being mated<span><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
to breed stock for pigeon communication should be calm and easy going,
not high-strung. Nervous or excitable birds should never be mated.</p>

<h3 id="Para_40">40. Line Breeding</h3>

<p>The aim of breeding from pigeons of the same or closely related
parentage is to reproduce the qualities of the old birds in their
young, amplifying the good qualities and minimizing the bad. Line
breeding requires the services of an experienced pigeoneer. Only
champions which are physically perfect should be mated. Except for line
breeding, inbreeding should not be practiced.</p>

<h3 id="Para_41">41. Nests</h3>

<p><em>a.</em> Bowl PG-75 is an expendable item made of pressed wood pulp and is
used as a nesting place for pigeons. It is advisable to replace the
bowls occasionally to avoid vermin. Cocks display a keen desire to use
the same nest compartment each time they are mated or, if moved to a
different loft, the nest compartment in the same relative position as
the one occupied previously. If not permitted to do this, the cock will
fight the occupant of the compartment. Therefore, consult previous
breeding records carefully in assigning nest compartments. Hens do not
show this trait, but accept a change in compartments and follow their
mates.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> Keep a supply of tobacco stems for nest material in a rack on the
floor of the loft. Allow the pigeons to arrange this material to suit
their fancy. Put a handful of sawdust or wood shavings in the nest bowl
to prevent breaking of eggs.</p>

<h3 id="Para_42">42. Control of Breeding</h3>

<p>The method of control given below is simple, natural, and successful;
it requires minimum handling of the birds.</p>

<div id="fig_39">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p64.jpg" width="600" height="419" alt="TL70208"></p><p><em>Figure 39. Parent pigeons in nest with youngsters in
Bowl PG-75.</em></p></div>

<p><span><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>Time.</span> Since best youngsters are obtained when birds are
mated during February, March, and April, whenever possible, arrange all
breeding for the year during these months. Eggs which should not be
hatched should be replaced with EGG PG-50 (glass).</p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Mating.</span> To begin breeding, place each pair to be mated
in its nest, and confine for approximately 1 day. Open one of the
nests and allow the pair to leave and return at will. The pair may be
considered mated after it returns to the nest several times. Close the
nest compartment and proceed in the same manner with the next pair, and
so on until each pair is mated.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> <span>After mating.</span> To minimize the danger of birds entering
the wrong nest and fighting, open only alternate nest compartments for
the first few days after mating.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> <span>Following season.</span> Any pair producing outstanding
youngsters should be mated the same way each year. Mated pairs
producing unsatisfactory youngsters should be separated and each
pigeon remated. Destroy breeder pigeons which produce unsatisfactory
youngsters subsequently.</p>

<h3 id="Para_43">43. Laying</h3>

<p>The first egg is usually laid during late afternoon from 7 to 10 days
after nesting has been started. The second egg is laid approximately 44
hours later. As a rule, parent birds do not hover the first egg until
the second egg has been laid. This usually enables the youngsters to
hatch within 1 hour of each other, and gives each one an equal chance.
The youngster from the first egg will be much larger than the other
if the parent birds start to hover at the time the first egg is laid.
Fertility is indicated if the egg becomes a light bluish color after 10
days, or if it shows blood lines after 5 days when held up to the sun‚Äôs
rays. Do not destroy the first pair of eggs as it is generally believed
that they often produce the best youngsters of that year.</p>

<h3 id="Para_44">44. Hatching and Feeding</h3>

<p><em>a.</em> The incubation period is from 17 to 18 days long. The hen pigeon
usually sits from 1600 of one day to 1000 the following morning; the
male pigeon sits the remainder of that day.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> The young pigeons are fed by both parents. Their first feed is a
thick, creamy-white excretion produced in the crop of both female and
male (pigeon milk or pap). Pigeons are the only birds both sexes of
which produce milk for their young. The young pigeon places it‚Äôs bill
down the throat of either parent, and the parent in return forces the
food into the young one‚Äôs throat. This method of feeding is known as
‚Äúregurgitation.‚Äù</p>

<h3 id="Para_45">45. Identification</h3>

<p>The identification record of the pigeon is started when the hen lays
the egg. Until the time that the youngster leaves the nest compartment,
this record is kept on a breeding card (<a href="#Para_27">par. 27</a>). For identification
purposes, each pigeon is banded when approximately 8 days of age (<a href="#Para_28">par. 28</a>).</p>

<h3 id="Para_46">46. Culling</h3>

<p>It is necessary to cull (destroy) severely to keep the stock in a loft
up to standard. Cull birds which do not meet physical requirements
for breeding<span><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span> unless all birds are needed. In addition, destroy those
which show a definite lack of intelligence, or which do not perform up
to the average. About 30 percent of the young bred in any one season
are normally under the physical standard and should be culled to keep
the stock from degenerating. In addition to losses sustained through
culling, 20 to 30 percent of the remaining stock may be expected to
be lost during training flights, as result of disease and injury, or
through additional culling because of substandard performance.</p>

<h2 id="SECTION_VII">SECTION VII<p>

DISEASES AND MEDICINES</p></h2></div>

<h3 id="Para_47">47. General</h3>

<p>Certain diseases attack pigeons. Normal preventive methods usually
protect pigeons from disease. If, however, these diseases are not
detected immediately, they are likely to sweep through the loft,
destroying or ruining most of the birds. It is necessary, therefore,
that the pigeoneer be able to detect, correctly diagnose, and treat the
more common pigeon diseases, in addition to taking preventive measures.</p>

<h3 id="Para_48">48. Prevention of Disease</h3>

<p>Disease prevention is much simpler and cheaper than control or cure.
Medicines are only emergency measures used in an attempt to overcome
disease.</p>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>Sanitation.</span> This is the most important way of preventing
disease and its value should never be underestimated. The following
rules for sanitation in the care of pigeons must be strictly adhered to:</p>

<p>(1) Keep loft clean and dry.</p>

<p>(2) Keep drinking fountain clean and water free from pollution.</p>

<p>(3) Quarantine new stock until certain that all birds are free from
disease.</p>

<p>(4) Never permit stray pigeons, wild birds, or rodents (mice, rats,
etc.) to enter the loft.</p>

<p>(5) Never feed pigeons on a dirty floor, because most of the more
serious diseases are transmitted through the droppings.</p>

<p>(6) Bury or burn diseased birds that have been destroyed.</p>

<p>(7) Immediately isolate birds showing any signs of sickness.</p>

<p>(8) After touching diseased birds disinfect the hands before handling
other birds.</p>

<p>(9) Thoroughly clean and disinfect lofts contaminated by disease.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Loft condition.</span> Pigeons must never be crowded in the
loft. It is best to subdivide large lofts into smaller compartments
for better control and ease of observation. Sunlight and dryness are
two great natural disinfectants which should be utilized fully through
plenty of window space and adequate ventilation. Eliminate strong
direct drafts because they chill birds and lower their resistance to
disease.</p>

<h3 id="Para_49">49. Control of Disease</h3>

<p><em>a.</em> Pigeons showing any signs of sickness must be segregated
immediately. In combat lofts there is normally no place available to
isolate and treat diseased birds, therefore, it is usually advisable to
destroy them and burn or bury their remains to avoid contaminating the
rest of the flock.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> In any case of disease, the loft should be thoroughly cleaned and
disinfected to destroy the germs of the disease as well as the mites
and lice which may be carriers. Cresol, saponated solution, is an
efficient disinfectant<span><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span> when used in a 4-percent solution in warm or
hot water. This disinfectant is issued to signal pigeon companies.</p>

<h3 id="Para_50">50. Anatomy and Physiology</h3>

<p>A knowledge of the structure and function of the bird‚Äôs body helps
a pigeoneer understand his birds and certain of their diseases. For
convenience, the various organs are divided into groups or systems
according to their functions.</p>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>Respiratory system.</span> (1) Mouth and nostrils admit air.</p>

<p>(2) Glottis or larynx is the opening into the trachea.</p>

<p>(3) Trachea conducts air to and from the lungs.</p>

<p>(4) Lungs are organs of gaseous interchange. Air spaces are surrounded
by a network of capillaries. Here the blood gives off carbon dioxide
and takes on oxygen.</p>

<p>(5) Nine air sacs cool the pigeon, give it buoyance, and mechanically
aid the pigeon to breathe.</p>

<p id="Para_50_b"><em>b.</em> <span>Digestive system.</span> (1) Mouth is the opening through which
food is received.</p>

<p>(2) Esophagus conducts food to the crop.</p>

<p>(3) Crop, or ingluvius, stores and softens the food.</p>

<p>(4) True stomach, or proventriculus, furnishes gastric digestive juices
that digest proteins and carbohydrates.</p>

<p>(5) Gizzard is the grinding and mixing organ.</p>

<p>(6) Pancreas furnishes digestive juices that digest fats, proteins, and
carbohydrates, besides furnishing certain internal secretions.</p>

<p>(7) Liver produces bile which helps digest food.</p>

<div id="fig_40">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p68.jpg" width="600" height="481" alt="TL70209"></p><p><em>Figure 40. Loft cleaning equipment.</em></p></div>

<p><span><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span></p>

<p>(8) Intestines provide space for food while it is being digested
and absorbed by the blood stream. The intestines also furnish some
digestive juices.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> <span>Circulatory system.</span> The circulatory system consists of
the heart, arteries, veins, and capillaries. Its function is to convey
nourishing blood from the heart to all parts of the body and to dispose
of the waste material produced by the working tissues. The heart
consists of four chambers: two ventricles and two auricles. The right
auricle receives the stale blood from the veins and pumps it into the
right ventricle which pumps it through an artery to the lungs. Here
waste matter, such as carbon dioxide, is eliminated from the blood
and fresh oxygen is restored. The blood then returns to the heart
through a vein entering the left auricle. Proceeding from the left
auricle to the left ventricle, it is pumped out through the arteries
to the capillaries, which are the smallest vessels of the body. The
capillaries circulate the blood through every tissue of the body,
dispensing oxygen and food. The blood then picks up waste material on
its return to the heart through the veins. The circulation of blood in
the pigeon is very rapid, and with the heart beating 200 to 300 times a
minute, only a few minutes are required to complete the circuit.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> <span>Reproductive system.</span> (1) Male birds have two testes
(testicles).</p>

<p>(2) Female birds have one (left) ovary and one oviduct, or egg tube,
through which the yolks pass to get the albumin, shell membrane, and
shell.</p>

<p><em>e.</em> <span>Urinary system.</span> The kidneys take impurities out of the
blood, and pass them into the cloaca (combination bladder and rectum).</p>

<h3 id="Para_51">51. Indications of Sickness</h3>

<p><em>a.</em> The common indications of sickness are‚Äî</p>

<p>(1) Refusing to eat.</p>

<p>(2) Dull, watery eyes.</p>

<p>(3) Droopy appearance with ruffled feathers and no desire to move.</p>

<p>(4) Green, watery droppings. If such droppings are noted in the loft
all birds should be watched until the sick one is detected.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> The easiest and best way to detect sick pigeons is to observe the
birds at feeding time. The pigeoneer should also examine all birds as
they are being basketed for training tosses.</p>

<h3 id="Para_52">52. Diseases</h3>

<p>Pigeons are subject to numerous infectious and contagious diseases.
These diseases are caused by germs such as bacteria and viruses, and
are transmitted in poor feed, dirty water, unclean lofts, and similar
conditions showing mismanagement. Infectious diseases are contagious if
the birds themselves transmit germs to one another.</p>

<p><em>a. Pigeon pox</em> is a common infectious, contagious disease which
usually affects unfeathered portions of the pigeon‚Äôs head and feet.
Pox often develop on the mucous membrane, lining of the mouth and
throat. In an outbreak, both types are usually seen. The pox appear as
swellings covered with light yellow material and are sometimes called
wet pock, diphtheria, or canker.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Symptoms.</em> The course of the disease runs about 4 weeks.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) The virus gets into the skin or mucous membrane and causes a
wartlike swelling, called a pock, at the point of infection. The virus
grows and causes the pock to enlarge for about 10 days.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) During the next 10 days the tissues begin to die and turn
yellow.<span><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span> Sometimes a blister forms in the pock, but only a slight
enlargement occurs during this period. During the last 10 days the
affected tissues begin to dry and form scabs which soon heal and drop
off.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Pock in the mouth and throat follows the same course as in (<em>b</em>)
above except they are covered with a light yellow layer of tissues.
Instead of becoming a dry scab formation, the pock becomes a yellow
cheesy formation.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Treatment.</em> Usually this is of little value, as pox will run its
course of about 4 weeks, regardless of treatment.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) One percent yellow oxide of mercury ointment will help soothe
affected eyes.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Pock in the mouth may be cut away, and the area painted with
tincture of iodine or carefully cauterized with silver nitrate to stop
bleeding.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Birds that refuse to eat may be fed by force until the disease
runs its course.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) Vaccination has no curative value on affected birds.</p>

<p>(<em>e</em>) Thoroughly clean and disinfect loft after an outbreak of this
disease.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Prevention.</em> This is simple if all susceptible birds are
vaccinated. Vaccination against pox is one of the most successful known
because all birds receiving it are made permanently immune. Birds may
be vaccinated at 5 or 6 weeks of age.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Pluck five or six feathers from the breast region of the bird and
brush the vaccine into the follicles.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) In about 10 days the follicles swell and a pock develops. This
runs a course of about 4 weeks and heals.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) All susceptible birds in a loft should be vaccinated at the same
time and each should be examined for ‚Äútakes‚Äù after vaccinations.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Paratyphoid</span> is a common infectious disease of pigeons
and is probably the most devastating of bacterial infectious diseases
at the present time. It may affect the bird in many ways, and produce
such a variety of symptoms that it is often mistaken for numerous
other diseases. The only definite way of diagnosing paratyphoid is by
laboratory tests. A tentative diagnosis can be made, however, upon
observing typical symptoms.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Symptoms.</em> The course of the disease varies from a rapidly fatal
blood poisoning to a slow, chronic disease with, or without, complete
recovery. The infection may take place through the egg, by way of milk
fed to youngsters, or by contaminated feed, water, and grit. The manner
of infection has no bearing on the course of the disease. The germs may
get into the blood-stream, go all through the body, and cause sudden
death; or the infection may be less severe and localize in any one of
the numerous organs.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Bacteria may localize in the intestines and produce mild to very
severe inflammation. This usually results in diarrhea.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Localizations in the lungs are very common and appear as hard,
dried abscesses. These are seldom so serious as to cause respiratory
distress.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Joint boils result from direct localization of the germs in the
joints of the legs or wings. Naturally this produces lameness.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) Inflammatory reactions of the spleen and liver are often the
result of the localization of the germ in these organs. Chronic
inflammation of the entire liver is also observed. The abdomen of such
birds usually fills with fluid and the bird then gets thin and dies.</p>

<p><span><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>

<p>(<em>e</em>) Paratyphoid germs quite often localize in the brain and cause
abscess formation. Such abscesses cause a variety of symptoms,
depending on which part of the brain is involved. Usually the bird
shows loss of equilibrium. It may twist its head and neck about, show
trembling of the head and neck, or other nervous symptoms. Such birds
rarely recover.</p>

<p>(<em>f</em>) Occasionally the germ will localize in the eye. The inside of the
eye turns white and sight is lost. Only rarely are both eyes involved.
Such birds appear to be very ill and usually die in a short period of
time.</p>

<p>(<em>g</em>) Germs may localize in the ovary of the female or testes of the
male. Such birds may show no symptoms, or they may become sterile. Eggs
laid by such birds may be infertile. Youngsters, if hatched, may be
weak and die soon after. Germs may localize in the oviduct and cause an
impacted oviduct.</p>

<p>(<em>h</em>) The only definite way of diagnosing paratyphoid is by laboratory
tests. A tentative diagnosis can be made, however, upon observing the
typical symptoms.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Treatment.</em> Treatment is useless for visibly affected birds.
Neither drugs nor vaccines seem to be of any value in treating this
condition. Many birds recover from mild infections without treatment.
Therefore, the best possible care should be provided for the birds
in order to keep their resistance high so that they can successfully
combat the infection and overcome disease.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Prevention.</em> Since contamination of feed, water, and grit by
droppings is probably the greatest cause of paratyphoid, sanitation is
the best preventive.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Clean the loft scrupulously.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Maintain sanitary drinking fountains with fresh water to avoid
spreading infection by way of water. Take special care to prevent
dampness from spillage or leakage around the drinking fountain, as this
makes an ideal place for bacteria to accumulate.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Feces from birds with diarrhea should be removed from the loft as
soon as noticed.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) Frequent disinfection of the loft with a strong disinfectant like
4 percent saponified cresol will help keep down contamination.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> <span>Trichomoniasis.</span> This is a very common disease of pigeons
commonly seen in the mouth, esophagus, or crop in the form of cheesy
yellow or white lesions. For this reason it is often called ‚Äúcanker‚Äù by
pigeon fanciers. The cause is a motile one-celled organism. Only the
common type of this organism will be considered here. This disease has
many carriers. It shows up only where sanitary conditions are bad or
other diseases are present.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Symptoms.</em> The course of the disease varies according to
resistance of the affected bird, treatment, and care. Young birds in
the nest become infected through ‚Äúmilk‚Äù of infected parents. Infection
doubtless spreads by contact while ‚Äúbilling‚Äù and fighting. Germs cause
affected tissues to die. This results in the formation of a sore or
opening down into the tissue with a varying-sized yellow, cheesy
exudate or scab forming over it. Sometimes such scabs become very large
and nearly fill the mouth, throat, or crop.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Treatment.</em> Various drugs and chemicals have been used to treat
trichomoniasis. However, this condition has proved quite unresponsive
to usual medication. In fact, drugs do not have much, if any, direct
effect on the healing of tissue. All that medicine can do is to cut
down the number<span><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span> of parasites present and permit nature to repair the
damage done to the tissue. Suggested procedures for treatment follow:</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Remove all yellow pus patches with cotton swabs. Then paint area
with a mixture of iodized oil and sulfanilamide powder. The iodized oil
is prepared by using 1 gram iodine, 1.5 grams potassium iodide, and 2
ounces light petrolatum. The iodine requires some time and frequent
shaking to dissolve. Make a small cotton swab on an applicator stick,
dip it into the oil, roll it in the sulfanilamide powder, and then
apply to cleaned trichomoniasis (canker) lesion. Daily treatment, rest,
and an abundance of good feed are necessary.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Clean off exudate by local applications of tincture of iodine,
or a mixture of one part iodine to three parts glycerine; at the same
time lesions will respond to such treatment. Silver nitrate may be used
either in stick form or in solution.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Prevention.</em> Sanitation is the best preventive.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Correct predisposing causes such as wet floors, nests, and
perches.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Try to isolate infected birds, provided the number is not too
large.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Attempt to control spread of parasitic infestation by using a
parasiticide like copper sulphate in the drinking water. This is used
in a 1-2000 solution.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> <span>Tuberculosis.</span> This is an infectious and highly contagious
disease caused by a highly-resistant germ which can live in soil for 2
years.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Symptoms.</em> The young die suddenly and old birds waste away.
Grayish white nodules appear in liver and spleen, basket ulcers in
intestines, and yellow nodules in all parts of the body.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Treatment.</em> There is no treatment for tuberculosis. Destroy all
affected birds and thoroughly clean and disinfect loft.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Prevention.</em> Keep all stray pigeons out of loft and maintain
sanitary conditions at all times.</p>

<p><em>e.</em> <span>One-eye cold</span> (<span>CONJUNCTIVITUS</span>). (1) <em>Symptoms.</em>
There is a watery discharge from the eye, and the surrounding membranes
are frequently swollen.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Treatment.</em> Place bird in a warm room and treat eye daily with one
drop of metaphin, or one drop of 15 percent argyrol.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Prevention.</em> Provide proper ventilation in the loft. Avoid
dampness and drafts.</p>

<p><em>f.</em> <span>Going light.</span> This is not a disease in itself but a
symptom or result of a disease. Any pigeon showing loss of flesh should
be isolated and observed until the affecting disease is determined.</p>

<p><em>g.</em> <span>Diarrhea.</span> This is not usually a distinct disease, but the
result of some other disease.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Symptoms.</em> Droppings are green and watery.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Treatment.</em> Sick birds should be isolated and observed to
determine if they have some other disease. Feeding of rice will usually
check the condition if it is caused by feed or drinking water.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Prevention.</em> Sanitary loft conditions, proper diet, and fresh
drinking water will help prevent it.</p>

<p><em>h.</em> <span>Sour crop.</span> Sour crop is caused by damp or mouldy grain,
impure water or lack of grit.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Symptoms.</em> The pigeon will sit with feathers ruffled. A greenish
diarrhea usually accompanies sour crop. On examination the crop is
found to be hard and distended.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Treatment.</em> Hold the bird with head down and gently press on
the crop until all feed has been removed. Flush out the crop with a
solution<span><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span> of 4 teaspoons of bicarbonate of soda to a quart of warm
water. Feed a light mixture, consisting mostly of rice, millet, kaffir
corn, and other small seeds. Repeat the cleaning and flushing of the
crop daily, if necessary, until this condition clears.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Prevention.</em> Sanitary loft conditions, proper diet, and fresh
drinking water will help prevent it.</p>

<h3 id="Para_53">53. External Parasites</h3>

<p>Many insects and related species live off other animals. Some of these
parasites, like lice, live on the host but feed only upon bits of its
feathers and tiny scales and excretions of the skin. Others are more
vicious and suck blood from the animal. Diseases are often spread from
bird to bird through the life habits of these parasites.</p>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>Lice.</span> Lice are undoubtedly the most common of these
external parasites.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Different species.</em> There are at least six different species of
lice that attack pigeons in this country. The three most common are‚Äî</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) <em>Feather louse.</em> This is the long, slender species that lives on
the barbs and shaft of the feather over nearly any part of the bird‚Äôs
body.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) <em>Golden feather louse.</em> This louse is a little shorter and much
broader and lives on the feathers, particularly on the bird‚Äôs body.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) <em>Body louse.</em> This is the largest of the pigeon lice. It lives on
the skin rather than on the feathers. It is thought that these lice,
by biting the very young pin feathers when they are filled with blood,
cause the small pinhole perforations often seen in pigeon feathers.</p>

<div id="fig_41">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p73.jpg" width="550" height="530" alt="TL70210"></p><p><em>Figure 41. Life cycle of pigeon lice.</em></p></div>

<p><span><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span></p>

<p>(2) <em>Habits</em> (<a href="#fig_41">fig. 41</a>). In order to combat lice properly and
intelligently, it is necessary to know something about where and how
they feed, live, and breed.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Adult lice live on the skin and feathers of the bird and only
rarely leave the pigeon. When accidentally dislodged, they crawl very
short distances to other birds. Lice cannot live longer than a few days
away from the birds.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Lice eat bits of feathers, scales, and other debris off the skin.
They do not suck blood.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Female lice lay eggs (nits) along the shafts of the feathers,
particularly on the primary coverts.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) Louse eggs hatch in 10 to 14 days.</p>

<p>(<em>e</em>) Young lice eat, molt (3 to 5 times), and grow to maturity in
about 14 days.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Diagnosis.</em> Infested pigeons are restless and constantly pick and
scratch in an effort to dislodge the lice. Heavily infested birds may
become weak and thin because the constant annoying movement of lice
interferes with their proper relaxation and rest. Careful examination
of the birds will reveal the lice.</p>

<div id="fig_42">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p74.jpg" width="550" height="541" alt="TL70211"></p><p><em>Figure 42. Life cycle of common red mite.</em></p></div>

<p>(4) <em>Treatment.</em> The use of sodium fluoride is a good standard method
for ridding pigeons of lice. It can be applied in two ways:</p>

<p><span><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span></p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) <em>Dip method</em> is very efficient, but can be used only in warm
weather. Birds should be dipped on a warm, sunny day early enough so
they will dry before night. Each bird is immersed into the solution
up to the head, and the feathers ruffled to allow penetration of the
solution. Then the mouth and nostrils are held shut and the head
immersed. The dip is made of 1 gallon warm water, and 1 ounce sodium
fluoride.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) <em>Dust method</em> may be used at any time. The birds are held while
a few pinches of powdered sodium fluoride are dusted into the feathers
over various parts of the body. Sodium fluoride poisons lice when
they eat it. Efficiency in delousing birds depends on thoroughness of
wetting or dusting.</p>

<p>(5) <em>Repeat treatment.</em> Neither method above will kill nits nor prevent
them from hatching; therefore, the delousing must be repeated in 10 to
14 days in order to kill newly hatched lice.</p>

<p>(6) <em>Prevention.</em> Normally, only pigeons carry pigeon lice. For this
reason, the spread of lice to or from other kinds of birds is of no
concern. However, common pigeons and stragglers are prolific sources of
spread. Contact in crates is also a common source of infestation. Lice
are often brushed from infested birds onto the hands and clothing of
pigeoneers who later carry them to clean birds handled later.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Red mites.</span> Red mites are a common parasite of the pigeon.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Habits</em> (<a href="#fig_42">fig. 42</a>). It is important to note the difference between
the habits of lice and mites.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Mites live in, on, and under the nest bowls, nest boxes, and any
available crack or crevice.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Mites go onto the birds only long enough to feed‚Äîusually about
¬Ω hour.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Red mites suck blood from the pigeons. It is the engorged blood
that makes the mite red.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) Mite eggs are deposited in the cracks and crevices or debris
around the nest box where they live.</p>

<p>(<em>e</em>) Eggs hatch in 2 or more days, according to weather conditions.</p>

<p>(<em>f</em>) Newly-hatched mites mature in about 5 days.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Diagnosis.</em> Pigeon‚Äôs loss of condition is the most evident
indication of mite infestation. Actual loss of blood is probably less
harmful to the bird than annoyance caused by crawling and biting of
mites.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Treatment.</em> Most good disinfectants supplied to lofts will kill
mites satisfactorily if worked well into all cracks and crevices.
Oily disinfectants are inexpensive and very effective, but leave the
loft rather unsightly. Whitewash kills only by covering up and is
ineffective if any areas are missed. For this reason, some of the more
refined cresols are used. Four percent saponified cresol in warm water
is quite effective.</p>

<p>(4) <em>Repeat.</em> Since the cresol does not kill the eggs, it is necessary
to repeat treatment in 5 to 7 days.</p>

<p>(5) <em>Prevention.</em> Mites that attack pigeons are apparently the same
as found on other birds, including domestic poultry. Therefore, wild
birds, straggling pigeons, and neighborhood poultry are possible
sources of infection. Light, dry, airy lofts do not favor breeding of
mites.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> Pigeon flies which are particularly troublesome in warm climates
are true flies with short, flat, wide bodies and long wings.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Life cycle</em> (<a href="#fig_46">fig. 46</a>). (<em>a</em>) Pigeon flies live among body feathers.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) They leave the birds only to deposit larvae, or when disturbed.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Adult flies suck blood from the birds.</p>

<p><span><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span></p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) Female flies deposit living larvae in or around the nest bowl,
nest box, or around the loft.</p>

<p>(<em>e</em>) Newly deposited larvae are white and about the size of a small
buck shot. Within a few hours, a hard shell forms around them and they
turn from white to brown and then to jet black.</p>

<p>(<em>f</em>) Young flies emerge from these shells in about 30 days and are
ready for their first meal of blood.</p>

<div id="fig_43">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p76.jpg" width="442" height="600" alt="TL70212"></p><p><em>Figure 43. Life cycle of pigeon fly.</em></p></div>

<p>(2) <em>Diagnosis.</em> Pigeon flies can easily be observed crawling among
the<span><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span> bird‚Äôs feathers. Their movement as well as biting greatly annoys
the birds. However, the greatest damage they do is transmitting pigeon
malaria.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Treatment.</em> A very effective and easily applied method of
treatment is to dust the birds lightly with pyrethrum powder. Sweep
nest boxes and loft carefully to collect pupae so that they can be
destroyed. Pigeon flies will not travel far from the birds; therefore,
keep stragglers out of loft and carefully inspect newly-introduced
birds to avoid admitting flies.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> <span>Mosquitoes.</span> Mosquitoes are a very common but usually
underestimated pest. Besides molesting the birds by biting and sucking
blood, they may transmit pox. These troublesome insects breed in
standing water, such as swampy areas, old tin cans, and rain barrels.
Control consists of draining or oiling breeding places and using
screens on loft openings.</p>

<p><em>e.</em> Other parasites attacking pigeons are fleas, chiggers, ticks,
bed bugs, depluming mites, feather mites, air sac mites, subcutaneous
mites, sand flies, and beetle larvae. Fortunately, these are rare.</p>

<h3 id="Para_54">54. Internal Parasites</h3>

<p>These are the worms that live inside pigeons. Round worms are by far
the most numerous. Tape worms are occasionally found in pigeons, but
seldom present a serious problem.</p>

<p><em>a.</em> Ascarids, or common large round worms are the largest and most
prevalent of the round worms. Adult worms are from 1 to 2 inches long.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Habits.</em> Knowledge of the life cycle of a round worm is of great
importance for successful control of this troublesome parasite. This
worm has a ‚Äúdirect‚Äù life cycle (<a href="#fig_47">fig. 47</a>) (completing it in one species).</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Mature worms live in the upper part of the small intestines and
feed by absorbing food from the intestinal contents through their own
body walls.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Eggs (ova) are deposited by female worms in the intestinal
contents of the pigeon, and later pass out in the pigeon droppings. It
has been estimated that female worms lay as many as 12,000 eggs a day.
Feces from parasitized birds often contain countless numbers of ova.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Freshly deposited worm eggs are much like freshly laid pigeon
eggs, in that they must be incubated before they are ready to hatch.
They need to remain in warm, moist litter or soil for 10 to 16 days
before the worm larvae can develop. Severe freezing, excessively hot
soil, and direct sunlight will destroy the eggs.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) When birds eat the incubated eggs, the worms hatch out in their
intestines.</p>

<p>(<em>e</em>) The tiny larvae then ‚Äúsew‚Äù themselves into the lining of the
intestines and begin to grow.</p>

<p>(<em>f</em>) After a few days, the larvae crawl back into the intestinal canal
where they mature in 30 to 40 days.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Diagnosis.</em> Ascarids injure birds in several ways.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) When the newly hatched worm ‚Äúsews‚Äù itself into the intestinal
lining the area around the puncture becomes inflamed because of
mechanical injury, loss of blood, and introduced infection. This
localized inflammation renders that part of the intestinal lining
useless for digesting and absorbing food.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) The worm absorbs food from the intestinal contents which should
go to the birds.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) In order to protect themselves and avoid being digested, the
worms give off a substance that neutralizes digestive juices. This
substance becomes mixed with intestinal contents and prevents proper
digestion.</p>

<p><span><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) Worms sometimes become so numerous that they actually clog the
intestines. As many as 500 worms have been found in a single bird.</p>

<p>(<em>e</em>) Worm-infested birds show loss of condition and general
unhealthiness. Diagnosis is made by finding worms or worm eggs in
droppings or by autopsy on typical specimens.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Treatment.</em> The following drugs are only effective against mature
worms and, at best, are only 80 percent efficient:</p>

<p>1-CC Oil of turpentine per bird.<br>
<span>¬Ω-CC Tetrachlorethylene per bird.</span><br>
<span>¬Ω-CC Carbon tetrachloride per bird.</span></p>

<p>(4) <em>Prevention.</em> This is relatively simple and practically 100 percent
effective.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Clean loft daily and provide fresh water.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) If aviary does not have a wire bottom spread clean sand about 1
or 2 inches deep over its floor once every two weeks.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Replace moisture and shade by sunshine and dry conditions.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> Strongyles are the most dangerous of the common round worms and
one of the most common causes of death among poorly kept pigeons. The
‚Äústrongyle‚Äù is a very small parasite which multiplies rapidly and is a
vicious blood sucker. Adult worms are from ¬Ω to ¬æ inches long and
about the same size as thin thread.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Habits.</em> This worm has a ‚Äúdirect‚Äù cycle; that gives the key to
successful control (<a href="#fig_45">fig. 45</a>).</p>

<div id="fig_44">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p78.jpg" width="550" height="520" alt="TL70213"></p><p><em>Figure 44. Life cycle of pigeon ascarids.</em></p></div>

<p><span><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span></p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Adult strongyles live in the upper intestinal contents, but may
be found as far up as the crop.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Strongyles are ravenous blood suckers.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Female worms deposit eggs in the intestinal contents which later
pass out in the feces.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) Eggs incubate in about 1 day, if conditions are favorable.</p>

<p>(<em>e</em>) Young larvae hatch out and molt about 8 hours later. These larvae
again molt in about 3 days and are then infective. Thus, about 5 days
elapse from the time the eggs are voided by the bird and the time the
young larval worms hatch, molt, and become infective.</p>

<p>(<em>f</em>) The infective larvae are eaten by the pigeons. Then they pass to
the intestines where they mature.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Diagnosis.</em> (<em>a</em>) Strongyles injure the birds by lacerating
the intestine and sucking blood. After the parasite moves on, the
laceration still bleeds considerably before a blood clot forms. Each
laceration results in an area of infection and inflammation.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Constant movement of the worms over the inflamed intestine adds
to the irritation.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Severe, and sometimes rapid, loss of condition and accompanying
anemia are usual symptoms. Diagnosis is confirmed by finding strongyles
in the intestine upon autopsy of typical specimens.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Treatment.</em> Treatment is not satisfactory. One-half CC doses of
tetrachlorethylene may be tried.</p>

<div id="fig_45">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p79.jpg" width="550" height="536" alt="TL70214"></p><p><em>Figure 45. Life cycle of pigeon strongyle.</em></p></div>

<p><span><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span></p>

<p>(4) <em>Prevention.</em> The same methods prescribed for ascarids apply to
strongyles.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> Other round worms attacking pigeons are numerous, but only
capillary worms will be discussed here. These are very thin, hair-like
worms sometimes found in the digestive tract of pigeons from the crop
down through the intestine. Their life cycle is direct. No satisfactory
drug has been found to rid pigeons of this worm. Fortunately, their
life cycle is similar to that of ascarids, and the same preventive
measures are effective.</p>

<p><em>d.</em> Tape worms, which are occasionally seen in pigeons, acquire a
length of 6 to 8 inches.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Life cycle.</em> Tape worms have what is called an indirect life
cycle, that is they must pass through at least two different species to
complete it (<a href="#fig_46">fig. 46</a>).</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Adult tape worms are found in the small intestine. Their bodies
are made up of a head and segments. The head is essentially an anchor
that fastens the worm to the intestine of the bird. The body segments
form at the head and mature as they grow further from the head.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Each segment contains both male and female sex organs and, as it
matures, becomes virtually a packet of tape worm eggs.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Segments break off and pass out in the feces.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) The tape worm‚Äôs eggs are then eaten by a snail, slug, beetle, or
other insect which becomes the ‚Äúintermediate host.‚Äù Here the tape worm
undergoes a certain amount of development.</p>

<div id="fig_46">
<p><img src="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55084/55084-h/images/i_p80.jpg" width="550" height="500" alt="TL70215"></p><p><em>Figure 46. Life cycle of pigeon tape worm.</em></p></div>

<p><span><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span></p>

<p>(<em>e</em>) If the intermediate host is eaten by a pigeon, the young tape
worm attaches itself to the bird‚Äôs intestine and soon grows to maturity.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Diagnosis.</em> Tape worms harm the host by injuring the intestine at
the point where they bury their heads, by absorbing food, and by giving
off antenzymes.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Treatment.</em> Unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>(4) <em>Prevention.</em> (<em>a</em>) Pigeons must be well-cared-for and fed so that
they will not care to eat the intermediate hosts.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) The method of prevention prescribed for ascarids is also
applicable for tape worms.</p>

<h3 id="Para_55">55. Treatment of Injuries</h3>

<p><em>a.</em> <span>Cuts and wounds.</span> Pigeons have marvelous powers of healing
their own tissues, perhaps because of their high body temperature and
rapid rate of body processes. The following are aids to healing.</p>

<p>(1) Clean solid or contaminated wounds with boric acid solution or some
very mild antiseptic. Strong disinfectants burn the exposed tissues and
delay wound healing.</p>

<p>(2) Stitch or suture large tears in the skin to make them relatively
smaller. Avoid placing suture in such a way that a pocket is formed for
this often results in an abscess formation. Use white silk or cotton
thread.</p>

<p>(3) Remove excessively rough edges or hanging flaps of skin with sharp
scissors.</p>

<p><em>b.</em> <span>Fractures.</span> (1) Broken bones in the extremities of the
legs usually respond readily to treatment; those involving the large
bones present a more complicated problem.</p>

<p>(2) The type of fracture governs the seriousness of the injury.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) <em>Simple</em> fractures are those in which there is no break in the
skin in the region of the fracture.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) <em>Compound</em> fractures are those in which there is a break in the
skin over the bone injury.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) <em>Partial</em> fractures are those in which the bone is cracked but
not completely separated.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) <em>Complete</em> fractures are those in which there is actual
separation of the parts of bone.</p>

<p>(<em>e</em>) <em>Comminuted</em> fractures are those in which the bone is splintered
or fragmented.</p>

<p>(3) Treatment of fractures is quite simple: bring broken parts into
contact and immobilize them to avoid movement which might injure
delicate healing tissues.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Since bones heal in whatever position they are placed, it is
necessary to splint the limb in as nearly normal a position as possible.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) Take care that the splint does not interfere with healing.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>1.</em> Do not bandage splint too tightly. The bandage must be snug
to avoid movement of the parts, however, if it is too tight, the
blood supply will be cut off and the limb will die. Splints applied
before the injured limb has swollen must be closely observed for
several hours, or until the swelling has reached its maximum so
that circulation is not impeded.</p>

<p><em>2.</em> Pad limb with cotton or gauze to protect it from the hard
surfaces of the splint.</p>

<p><em>3.</em> Dust powdered boric acid on the region of the fracture,
particularly if the fracture is compound.</p></blockquote>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Splints may be easily and satisfactorily fashioned from pieces
of<span><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span> pliable tin. Cut and bend to fit contour of limb in normal resting
position (<a href="#fig_47">fig. 47)</a>. Splints for fractures in the shank should extend
down along the shank on one side, then bend to form a loop down around
the foot and back up the opposite side of the limb. In a short time
the bird learns that it can step on the limb without pain because the
weight falls on the loop of the splint rather than on the foot.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) Splints should be left in place for 3 weeks before removing.
Healing, if successful, will be sufficient to permit removal of splint
at this time.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> <span>Torn crops.</span> These may be successfully sutured if the
edges are turned in so that the outside surfaces, not the lining, of
the crop come in contact. The skin may then be sutured to help support
the crop.</p>

  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
