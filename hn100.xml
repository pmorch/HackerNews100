    <p>The other day, my twelve-year-old daughter asked me what platform I spend most of my time on when I'm on my phone or computer.
She intuitively noticed that it must be some kind of nerd stuff since it looks so odd and doesn't resemble Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, etc., which she knows but luckily refrains from using herself — yet.</p>
<p>For those of you who are curious, here is my explanation of what <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> is, why I like it, and what sets it apart from the others.
I deliberately left out the negative aspects for a different article, so be warned that this is a one-sided view only<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="explanation">Explanation</h2><p>HN is a website where any registered user can submit links to other websites.
Each link is given a single-line title, which is usually the title of the original resource.
Other users can vote up such submissions or comment on them.
Highly upvoted submissions are listed on the front page.
The same holds true for comments: Users can vote on them (and now also downvote) or comment on them.
There are some minor nuances, but this is the core functionality.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html">HN Guidelines</a> are concise and to the point — there isn't much to add.</p>
<p>However, I would like to share what I find most notable about the concept and the result.</p>
<h3 id="content-shall-satisfy-intellectual-curiosity">Content shall satisfy "intellectual curiosity"</h3><p>The majority of submissions are in the broad category of information technology.
When it comes to different disciplines, you will find submissions on very general, high-level topics and foundational and basic material. You will also find very detailed, in-depth, and niche content, which definitely qualifies as one interpretation of the term "hacker," referring to someone with an in-depth knowledge of a specific technical topic.
However, there are also interesting finds from philosophy, business, history, archaeology, biology, mathematics, literature, and linguistics, which cover the full range of content depth.
The best part? No politics, trivia, or spam.
Mainstream media news is rare and only included if it provides a long-term perspective on a governing topic from any of the aforementioned fields.</p>
<p>Side note: Death notices of notable people in the above field may result in a black banner. It is not uncommon to see comments from past acquaintances of the deceased, which serve as a special form of obituary.</p>
<p>Niche and mainstream topics are covered as long as they stimulate intellectual curiosity.
The benefit of this spectrum is that you are neither siloed in an obscure filter bubble nor bored by common mainstream conformity.</p>
<h3 id="moderation">Moderation</h3><p>Two dedicated human moderators, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=dang">dang</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=tomhow">tomhow</a>, take care of the platform — and it shows.
When a post is down-voted or flagged, a self-cleaning procedure is triggered by other users, so quality posts and comments tend to float to the top.</p>
<h3 id="reach">Reach</h3><p>Although the platform is based in Silicon Valley, the discussions ripple through the Western tech world. California, USA and the rest of the world.
Rare finds from exotic locations around the world pop up from time to time, provided they are in English.</p>
<p>There are many heavy users who have gained fame both inside and outside of HN.
Many tech-related CEOs and founders are present and contribute if their product is mentioned.
More importantly, almost any submitted topic has experts who share their knowledge or experience in an unpretentious way.</p>
<h3 id="inspiration-and-surprise">Inspiration and Surprise</h3><p>There is always an interesting link available.
The comments are often more valuable because they guide you through complex topics, offer alternatives, keep facts straight, and challenge opinions.
Real information is conveyed when it contains surprises, and there are plenty to be found in most threads.</p>
<h3 id="humility">Humility</h3><p>The username is the sole representation of one's ego.
Users can provide more information in their "About" section, but this does not hinder a good discussion and is probably not even clicked on by most readers.
HN is also text-only.
There is no multimedia or distractions.
The platform and the mindset of most users are focused on signal, not noise.
You can read about ego defaults in some comments, but any unsubstantial contribution is either downvoted or flagged so as not to spoil the reading experience, or balanced by a quality argument.</p>
<h2 id="the-good-the-true-and-the-beauty">The good, the true and the beauty</h2><p>In conclusion, HN is a great space for discovering things, following interesting discussions, learning, and exchanging ideas with others, whether they are like-minded or opposed.</p>
<p>As far as I know, it is the only "social network" that allows you to grow intellectually through participation.
This is probably the highest compliment an internet platform can receive in 2025.</p>

What I’m seeing working is learning-from-demonstration. Folks get some robots and some puppeteering interfaces (standard seems to be two copies of the robot where you grab &amp; move one of them and the other matches, or an Oculus headset + controllers or hand tracking) and record some 10-30 second activity over and over again (100s of times). We can then train a neural network to mimic those examples. This has unlocked tasks that have steps that are somewhat chaotic (like pulling a corner of a towel to see if it lays flat) or high state space (like how a wooden block is on one of 6 sides but a towel can be bunched up in myriad different ways). But thinking about it, it should be clear what some of the limitations are. Each of these has exceptions, but form a general trend.</p><ol><li><p><span>No force feedback at the wrists.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-173034465" href="https://generalrobots.substack.com/p/benjies-humanoid-olympic-games#footnote-2-173034465" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> The robot can only ever perform as well as the human teleoperation and we don’t yet have good standard ways of getting force information to the human teleoperator.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Limited finger control.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-173034465" href="https://generalrobots.substack.com/p/benjies-humanoid-olympic-games#footnote-3-173034465" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span><span> It's hard for the teleoperator (and AI foundation model) to see and control all the robot fingers with more finesse than just open/close.</span></p></li><li><p><span>No sense of touch.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-173034465" href="https://generalrobots.substack.com/p/benjies-humanoid-olympic-games#footnote-4-173034465" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span><span> Human hands are packed absolutely full of sensors.

    <a href="https://blog.chriszacharias.com/a-conspiracy-to-kill-ie6">A Conspiracy To Kill IE6</a>
  </h2>
	<p>The bittersweet consequence of YouTube’s incredible growth is that so many stories will be lost underneath all of the layers of new paint. This is why I wanted to tell the story of how, ten years ago, a small team of web developers conspired to kill IE6 from inside YouTube and got away with it.</p>

<p>I do not recall the exact triggering event that led to our web development team laying out plans to kill IE6 over lunch in the YouTube cafeteria. Perhaps it was the time I pushed out a CSS stylesheet that included an attribute selector on a semi-supported HTML element. Any reasonable web developer would expect this to be ignored by browsers not up to the task. This was not the case with older flavors of IE. Under very specific conditions, an attribute selector on an unsupported HTML element in IE would create an internal recursion that would at best, cause the browser to crash and at worst, trigger a blue screen of death. Or perhaps it was the hundredth time one of our software engineers had innocently pushed out an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag with an empty src attribute. Nobody joining the team could be expected to know that in early versions of IE, the browser would load the root path “/” for empty src attributes. The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag would suddenly behave like an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, loading our homepage and all of its dependent resources in what could become an exponentially expanding recursive loop. Whenever an empty image tag found its way on to the homepage, it was all-hands-on-deck emergency to locate and replace the offending code before we melted our servers into paperweights.</p>

<p>Regardless of whatever the event at that time was, it had been brutal and it had been IE6 related. IE6 had been the bane of our web development team’s existence. At least one to two weeks every major sprint cycle had to be dedicated to fixing new UI that was breaking in IE6. Despite this pain, we were told we had to continue supporting IE6 because our users might be unable to upgrade or might be working at companies that were locked in. IE6 users represented around 18% of our user base at that point. We understood that we could not just drop support for it. However, sitting in that cafeteria, having only slept about a few hours each in the previous days, our compassion for these users had completely eroded away. We began collectively fantasizing about how we could exact our revenge on IE6. One idea rose to the surface that quickly captured everyone’s attention. Instead of outright dropping IE6 support, what if we just threatened to? How would users react? Would they revolt against YouTube? Would they mail death threats to our team like had happened in the past? Or would they suddenly become loud advocates of modern browsers? We openly daydreamed about cubicle workers around the world suddenly inventing creative “business” reasons for needing upgraded browsers. Grandparents would hold their technically savvy grand-kids hostage, demanding they fix their “YouTubes”. What had begun as a team therapy session started to materialize into an actual plan, a plan we quickly realized we were uniquely positioned to execute on. </p>

<p>The plan was very simple. We would put a small banner above the video player that would only show up for IE6 users. It would read “We will be phasing out support for your browser soon. Please upgrade to one of these more modern browsers.” Next to the text would be links to the current versions of the major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, IE8 and eventually, Opera. The text was intentionally vague and the timeline left completely undefined. We hoped that it was threatening enough to motivate end users to upgrade without forcing us to commit to any actual deprecation plan. Users would have the ability to close out this warning if they wanted to ignore it or deal with it later. The code was designed to be as subtle as possible so that it would not catch the attention of anyone monitoring our checkins. Nobody except the web development team used IE6 with any real regularity, so we knew it was unlikely anyone would notice our banner appear in the staging environment. We even delayed having the text translated for international users so that a translator asking for additional context could not inadvertently surface what we were doing. Next, we just needed a way to slip the code into production without anyone catching on.</p>

<p><img src="https://cz.imgix.net/youtube-ie6-highlight.png?fm=pjpg&amp;w=800&amp;border=1000" alt="YouTube IE6 Deprecation Banner"></p>

<p>The IE6 Deprecation Banner on YouTube in 2009</p>

<p>It turned out that a handful of us had entered YouTube at an interesting time… several months after YouTube had been acquired by Google but before Google had begun deeply integrating YouTube into their larger organization. The early YouTube engineers were rightfully territorial and initially hesitant to adapt to Google’s infrastructure and norms. With their penchants for gray-hat hacking, fast cars, and hard whiskey and an uncommon number of piercings, tattoos, and minor arrest records, many had been rejected during previous Google interviews. Ending up at YouTube instead, they found themselves breaking their backs to stay ahead of exponentially growing traffic while having to constantly defend against critics explaining how Google Video would imminently kill them. By the time they were acquired into Google, many of these engineers had come to view their outcast identity as a critical component of their eventual success. </p>

<p>To cement their authority over the YouTube codebase during the integration into Google, the early engineers created a specialized permission set called “OldTuber”. OldTuber granted you the ability to completely bypass the new Google-oriented code enforcement policies, enabling anyone holding it to commit code directly to the YouTube codebase, with only the most glancing of code reviews from anyone. No need for code readability. No need for exhaustive tests. No need for maintaining code coverage. If you broke the site by improperly wielding OldTuber status, it was on your head and you would lose the privilege immediately, if not your job. So you just had to be a good citizen and never break the site. Our boss, an early YouTube engineer himself, had gone out of his way to ingratiate the web development team with the rest of the early YouTube engineers. Through his efforts, a couple of us eventually found ourselves in possession of OldTuber status, despite never having been a part of the original team. It was like we were just walking down the street when someone mistook us for valets and handed us the keys to their Ferrari. For better or for worse, we were not exactly the types to just hand the keys back and walk away. We saw an opportunity in front of us to permanently cripple IE6 that we might never get again. If this went at all wrong, a number of us would surely be fired. Our most renegade web developer, an otherwise soft-spoken Croatian guy, insisted on checking in the code under his name, as a badge of personal honor, and the rest of us leveraged our OldTuber status to approve the code review. The code merged into production and our banner went live a few days later.</p>

<p>The first person to come by our desks was the PR team lead. He was a smart, dapper man who was always bubbling with energy and enthusiasm. Except this time. This time he was uncharacteristically prickly. He had come in on an otherwise normal day to find email from every major tech news publication asking why the second largest website on the planet was threatening to cut off access to nearly a fifth of its user base. Fortunately for us, the publications had already settled on a narrative that this was a major benefit to the Internet. By their call, YouTube was leading the charge towards making the web a faster, safer experience for all of its users. The entire PR team had Macs running Chrome and could not even see what we had done, let alone issue comments to the press on any of it. They were caught completely unaware. We eagerly told them everything about what we had launched and helped them craft the necessary talking points to expand on the narrative already established by the media. Satisfied that he could get back in front of the story, the PR team lead turned and warned us to never do anything like this without telling him first. He did not want to let great public relations opportunities like this slip by ever again.</p>

<p>Next came the lawyers. Two senior lawyers sprinted over to our desks in a state of buttoned-down panic. They immediately demanded that we remove the banner. We explained how we would need the SREs to do an emergency push and that it would take at least a few hours to do. Frustrated, one of the lawyers  asked “Why did you have to put Chrome first?” Confused, I explained that we did not give any priority to Chrome. Our boss, in on the conspiracy with us, had thoughtfully recommended that we randomize the order of the browsers listed and then cookie the random seed for each visitor so that the UI would not jump around between pages, which we had done. As luck would have it, these two lawyers still used IE6 to access certain legacy systems and had both ended up with random seeds that placed Chrome in the first position. Their fear was that by showing preferential treatment to Chrome, we might prick the ears of European regulators already on the lookout for any anti-competitive behavior. While the lawyers conceded that nothing we had done would have likely risen to that level of offense, it had happened on their watch and they did not appreciate that. I repeatedly cleared the cookies in my copy of IE6 and showed the browsers reshuffling with each refresh. Content with the demonstration, the lawyers quickly retreated back to their desks without any further concerns.</p>

<p>I expected the next people to be the engineering managers and that they would be the angriest given how clearly we had abused our OldTuber status. Suspiciously, nobody came by that day. The next day, a handful of engineers stopped by to congratulate us on the launch of the banner after reading articles around the Internet, but that was it. I asked my boss if he was getting any blowback and he shrugged, indicating that nobody had pulled him aside yet. It seemed that for the moment we were in the clear. Surprised and unable to make sense of this, I probed one of the managers about what he thought about the banner launching. He responded “Oh, I just figured you guys copied the banner that Google Docs had put up.” I was confused. How could Google Docs have beaten us to the punch on this? I opened up Google Docs in IE6 and sure enough, a banner very much like ours was showing at the top. It implored their users to upgrade to avoid breaking features in terms similarly vague to ours.</p>

<p>I had met a few engineers on the Google Docs team while working on some shared Javascript libraries. I reached out to one and asked how they had arrived at the decision to launch their own banner. He explained to me that they had been wanting to deprecate IE6 support for a long time but their managers would not let them for the same reasons we had always heard. One of their engineers testing in IE6 had noticed the YouTube banner pretty shortly after it went live and immediately took it to their manager as evidence as to why they should do the same. Shortly thereafter, the Google Docs engineers whipped up their own IE6 banner and pushed it into production, presumably under the mistaken assumption that we had done our diligence and had received all of the necessary approvals. The first time many Googlers heard chatter about IE6 banners was from email threads where other teams had begun asking if they could deprecate IE6 like Google Docs had. Luck would have it that this had included many of our managers. Amazingly, we had somehow bypassed detection as the originators of the IE6 banner inside of Google.</p>

<p>Eventually the YouTube engineering management did ask themselves how the decision to deprecate IE6 was ultimately made, given it happened so quickly and seemed conspicuously premature for a media site of our scale and with such a wide user base. Once they realized what had happened, they cornered our boss for details, grappled with the consequences of our actions and begrudgingly arrived at the conclusion that the ends had justified the means. Between YouTube, Google Docs, and several other Google properties posting IE6 banners, Google had given permission to every other site on the web to add their own. IE6 banners suddenly started appearing everywhere. Within one month, our YouTube IE6 user base was cut in half and over 10% of global IE6 traffic had dropped off while all other browsers increased in corresponding amounts. The results were better than our web development team had ever intended. </p>

<p>We somehow got away with our plan to kill IE6 without facing any meaningful corrective action. Few people even knew we were involved at all and those that did, did not want to bring attention to it or risk encouraging similar behavior. At a beer garden in San Francisco, our boss, winking his hardest, made us swear to never do anything like this again. We agreed, toasted IE6 falling into single digit percentages, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/06/23/bzzzzzz-youtube-gets-a-vuvuzela-button-seriously/">and never snuck anything into production again.</a></p>

        <p>After announcing its retirement, many generous people and organizations offered help - thank you! The project is now transitioning to an RIR (Regional Internet Registry), which will continue running the site in the public interest. I'll share updates as things progress.</p>

        <h2>Previous message</h2>

        <p><strong>TL;DR: I will retire <a href="http://test-ipv6.com/">test-ipv6.com</a> in December 2025.</strong></p>

        <p>I have provided <a href="http://test-ipv6.com/">test-ipv6.com</a> to the public since 2010. I've sunk significant resources - engineering, support, equipment, and hosting fees - into what is a revenue-free product.</p>

        <p>Without going into details: I feel now is the time for me to refocus my resources within the family.<br>
        I hope people will understand, and respect this decision.</p>

        <p>I am shutting the site down, with a target of "during winter break"  (December) 2025.</p>

        <p>Mirror operators: Should you wish to keep your mirrors up, they will stop getting updates in December.</p>

        <p>Service providers: If you have runbooks for your support team based on this site, or based on RIPE-631, you'll need to update those.</p>

        <p>FAQ:</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Will I (jfesler) transfer the source?</strong></p>

        <p><strong>A:</strong> These portions are already public.</p>

        <p>These are already public.<br>

        <p>The remaining parts, such as geolocation and service provider lookups,  I am contractually unable to release.  Please do not ask.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What about monitoring and validation?</strong></p>

        <p>Delan Azabani has shared with me <a href="https://codeberg.org/shuppy/fallen-sky">https://codeberg.org/shuppy/fallen-sky</a>, which includes a standalone validator.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Will I (jfesler) transfer the domain?</strong></p>

        <p><strong>A:</strong> I'd consider a reputable RIR or NIC organization serving the public interest taking things over.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Should mirrors be retired?</strong></p>

        <p><strong>A:</strong> I would suggest it.  Once the primary site is retired, I will stop monitoring the functionality of your mirror, and stop providing geolocation and service provider lookups.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: I have more questions or comments!</strong></p>

        <p><strong>A:</strong> If we ever meet for coffee or beer, ask me then.</p>

  <p> Quantity has a quality of its very own. Some writers are good - and they write <em>all the time</em>. The holy trinity of newsletter writers (Matt Levine, Byrne Hobart and Patrick McKenzie) write up to <a href="https://x.com/dagulf795/status/1609985606045634560">700k words a year</a> - so 2,000 words a day. I think Matt Levine’s schedule looks a little bit like waking up and doing 4000 words early in the morning about three times a week, then hitting send on his newsletter. Marc Rubinstein (another pretty prolific writer!) recently shared this <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-22/two-decades-and-4-579-emails-later-ceos-still-read-goldberg">Bloomberg profile</a> of Jason Goldberg - “a Barclays analyst who has been writing a daily briefing note for 20 years”. It’s not just newsletter writers - for instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Kerr">Philip Kerr</a> managed to write 42 books in 29 years by just working obsessively, writing on birthdays and Christmas. <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hoffman-man.html">Paul Erdös</a> had an even more insane work schedule:</p><blockquote><p> “Erdös first did mathematics at the age of three, but for the last twenty-five years of his life, since the death of his mother, he put in nineteen-hour days, keeping himself fortified with 10 to 20 milligrams of Benzedrine or Ritalin, strong espresso, and caffeine tablets. "A mathematician," Erdös was fond of saying, "is a machine for turning coffee into theorems." When friends urged him to slow down, he always had the same response: "There'll be plenty of time to rest in the grave."</p><p>&nbsp;Erdös would let nothing stand in the way of mathematical progress. When the name of a colleague in California came up at breakfast in New Jersey, Erdös remembered a mathematical result he wanted to share with him. He headed toward the phone and started to dial. His host interrupted him, pointing out that it was 5:00 A.M. on the West Coast. "Good," Erdös said, "that means he'll be home."<br> …<br> Like all of Erdös's friends, Graham was concerned about his drug-taking. In 1979, Graham bet Erdös $500 that he couldn't stop taking amphetamines for a month. Erdös accepted the challenge, and went cold turkey for thirty days. After Graham paid up--and wrote the $500 off as a business expense--Erdös said, "You've showed me I'm not an addict. But I didn't get any work done. I'd get up in the morning and stare at a blank piece of paper. I'd have no ideas, just like an ordinary person. You've set mathematics back a month." He promptly resumed taking pills, and mathematics was the better for it.</p></blockquote><div><p> Looking at these guys, one feels a bit inadequate. <strong>How do they do it?</strong> Why aren’t you doing it? What did you get done this week?</p><p>  One answer to this question is Scott Alexander’s essay is <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/31/the-parable-of-the-talents/"><em>The Parable of the Talents</em>.</a> In the essay, he’s basically trying to square a circle: to reconcile the ideas that 1. natural talent exists and 2. everyone is morally equivalent. Alexander puts a lot of effort into proving point 1, and I think he does a great job. Here are the relevant sections. I agree with all of this, which is why I’m not trying to put it into my own words. But I’m particularly interested in his point that talent is a real thing, and some people are just better at things than others. He takes this <em>really</em> seriously.&nbsp;</p></div><blockquote><p>“Consider for a moment Srinivasa Ramanujan, one of the greatest mathematicians of all time. He grew up in poverty in a one-room house in small-town India. He taught himself mathematics by borrowing books from local college students and working through the problems on his own until he reached the end of the solveable ones and had nowhere else to go but inventing ways to solve the unsolveable ones.</p><p> There are a lot of poor people in the United States today whose life circumstances prevented their parents from reading books to them as a child, prevented them from getting into the best schools, prevented them from attending college, et cetera. And pretty much all of those people&nbsp;<em>still</em>&nbsp;got more educational opportunities than Ramanujan did.</p><p> And from there we can go in one of two directions. First, we can say that a lot of intelligence is innate, that Ramanujan was a genius, and that we mortals cannot be expected to replicate his accomplishments.</p><p> Or second, we can say those poor people are&nbsp;<em>just not trying hard enough.</em></p><p>…<br>  In&nbsp;high school English, I got A++s in all my classes, Principal’s Gold Medals, 100%s on tests, first prize in various state-wide essay contests, etc. In Math, I just barely by the skin of my teeth scraped together a pass in Calculus with a C-.</p><p> Every time I won some kind of prize in English my parents would praise me and say I was good and should feel good. My teachers would hold me up as an example and say other kids should try to be more like me. Meanwhile, when I would bring home a report card with a C- in math, my parents would have concerned faces and tell me they were disappointed and I wasn’t living up to my potential and I needed to work harder et cetera.</p><p> And&nbsp;<em>I don’t know which part bothered me more</em>.</p><p> Every time I was held up as an example in English class, I wanted to crawl under a rock and die. I didn’t do it! I didn’t study at all, half the time I did the homework in the car on the way to school, those essays for the statewide competition were thrown together on a lark without a trace of real effort. To praise me for any of it seemed and still seems utterly unjust.</p><p> On the other hand, to this day I believe I deserve a fricking&nbsp;<em>statue</em>&nbsp;for getting a C- in Calculus I. It should be in the center of the schoolyard, and have a plaque saying something like “Scott Alexander, who by making a herculean effort managed to pass Calculus I, even though they kept throwing random things after the little curly S sign and pretending it made sense.”</p><p> And without some notion of innate ability, I don’t know what to do with this experience. I don’t want to have to accept the blame for being a lazy person who just didn’t try hard enough in Math. But I&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;don’t want to have to accept the credit for being a virtuous and studious English student who worked harder than his peers.&nbsp;<br> …</p><p> When I was 6 and my brother was 4, our mom decided that as an Overachieving Jewish Mother she was contractually obligated to make both of us learn to play piano. She enrolled me in a Yamaha introductory piano class, and my younger brother in a Yamaha ‘cute little kids bang on the keyboard’ class.</p><p> A little while later, I noticed that my brother was now with me in my Introductory Piano class.</p><p> A little while later, I noticed that my brother was now by far the best student in my Introductory Piano Class, even though he had just started and was two or three years younger than anyone else there.</p><p> A little while later, Yamaha USA flew him to Japan to show him off before the Yamaha corporate honchos there.</p><p> Well, one thing led to another, and my brother won several international piano competitions, got a professorship in music at age 25, and now routinely gets news articles written about him calling him “among the top musicians of his generation”.</p><p> Meanwhile, I was always a mediocre student at Yamaha. When the time came to try an instrument in elementary school, I went with the violin to see if maybe I’d find it more to my tastes than the piano. I was quickly sorted into the remedial class because I couldn’t figure out how to make my instrument stop sounding like a wounded cat. After a year or so of this, I decided to switch to fulfilling my music requirement through a choir, and everyone who’d had to listen to me breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p> Every so often I wonder if somewhere deep inside me there is the potential to be “among the top musicians of my generation.” I try to recollect whether my brother practiced harder than I did. My memories are hazy, but I don’t think he practiced&nbsp;<em>much</em>&nbsp;harder until well after his career as a child prodigy had taken off.</p><p>…</p><p> I dunno. But I don’t think of myself as working hard at any of the things I am good at, in the sense of “exerting vast willpower to force myself kicking and screaming to do them”. It’s possible I&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;work hard, and that an outside observer would accuse me of eliding how hard I work, but it’s not a conscious elision and I don’t feel that way from the inside.</p><p>…</p><div><p> But I&nbsp;<em>still</em>&nbsp;feel like there’s something going on here where the solution to me being bad at math and piano isn’t just “sweat blood and push through your brain’s aversion to these subjects until you make it stick”. When I read biographies of Ramanujan and other famous mathematicians, there’s no sense that they ever had to do that with math. When I talk to my brother, I never get a sense that he had to do that with piano. And if I am good enough at writing to qualify to have an opinion on being good at things, then I don’t feel like I ever went through that process myself.</p><p> So this too is part of my deal with myself. I’ll try to do my best at things, but if there’s something I really hate, something where I have to go uphill every step of the way, then it’s okay to admit mediocrity. I won’t beat myself up for not forcing myself kicking and screaming to practice piano. And in return I won’t become too cocky about practicing writing a lot.”</p></div></blockquote><p>Here’s a related piece - his <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/25/apologia-pro-vita-sua/"><em>Apologia pro vita sua</em></a><em>.</em></p><blockquote><p> “I have had a really busy few months. I think it will be letting up soon, but I’m not sure. And I’ve told a lot of people who needed things from me, for one reason or another, “I’m sorry, I’m too busy to take care of this right now.”</p><p> And I worry that some of those people read my blog and think “Wait, if you have enough time to write blog posts nearly every day, some of which are up to six thousand words long, why don’t you have enough time to do a couple of hours work for me?”</p><p> And the answer is – you fancy doctors with your mathematics and subtraction might&nbsp;<em>say</em>&nbsp;that I could just take a couple of hours away from blogging and use those free hours to write that one thing or analyze that one study or whatever, but you’re not going to fool&nbsp;<em>me</em>.</p><p> Just as drugs mysteriously find their own non-fungible money, enjoyable activities mysteriously find their own non-fungible time. If I had to explain it, I’d say the resource bottleneck isn’t time but energy/willpower, and that these&nbsp;<em>look</em>&nbsp;similar because working hard saps energy/willpower and relaxing for a while restores it, so when I have less time I also have less energy/willpower. <strong>But some things don’t require energy/willpower and so are essentially free. Writing this is my addiction, so it’s free.</strong> Doesn’t mean anything else is.”</p></blockquote><p> Erdös’s genius, then, was that his 19 hour workdays were “essentially free”. He didn’t sweat blood and push though his brain’s aversion to doing maths - it <em>must have </em>come pretty naturally to him. So it’s really important to do things that come naturally to you.</p><p> Here’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/cMZJ5pZFsAI" target="_blank">Jim Donovan talking about his SLA with clients while working as an investment banker:</a></p><blockquote><p>“When I started at Goldman Sachs … I would say to clients, you can leave me a voicemail, any time, unless I’m dead or asleep, I check it every ten seconds… And I don’t sleep very long either.”</p></blockquote><p> I suspect that for Donovan, this didn’t feel like sweating blood - it was just how he was wired. Some people (not me!) are slow repliers, some people hate always being available, and those people are going to be terrible investment bankers and Jim Donovan is going to take their clients. Because for him, this stuff came naturally. He’s a 99.999th percentile voicemail replier. He was born to do it - and what’s awesome is that he found a way to turn his natural talent into loads of money. </p>

<p> I know <em>professional writers</em> that hear about Matt Levine and Scott Alexander’s work routine, and shake their heads. They produce a book every few years; they need to waste a few hours to get in the mindset to do anything. The can’t just jot down a paragraph here and there in their breaks. And yet even though they can’t hold themselves to that standard, they’re still professional writers. I mean, look how Hunter S. Thompson lived (yes, I know it’s not real):</p>

  <p> My writing process doesn’t look much like Levine’s. I don’t have his consistency. The general pattern is that I spend weeks or months stewing on something, and then take a few hours and write it all down in one go, with minimal editing. That’s in contrast to a friend who told me recently that he spent two years writing 52 essays - one every two weeks, with metronomic consistency. </p><p> Here’s an example from my finals. I had a coursework essay due at 12pm, and the night before, I went for dinner with my two best friends. At about 5am I had <em>maybe</em> the introduction written - and I felt my life flashing before my eyes. Was this going to be the moment I failed my finals? But because I’d spent six months thinking about the question on and off, over the next few hours I managed to write 2,000 words on the subject of <a href="https://www.felixstocker.com/blog/property">“Only God, not Man, makes an heir”: to what extent did Henry II’s legal reforms strengthen God’s hand?”</a>, and got a 78 for my troubles - my best mark across all my papers.</p><p> Honestly, that was super fun - it wasn’t a sustainable or consistent way to get work done, but I enjoyed the pressure, I enjoyed the challenge, and I definitely enjoyed the 78. Writing seems to come to me in these spurts, which implies that I’m going to struggle to work with the consistency that Matt Levine achieves; ergo, I should not become a professional newsletter writer.</p>

  <div><p> If you read enough finance books you start to pick up anecdotes about what makes a good trader. Lots of my friends are traders - there’s an archetype of “British Indian, studied economics at Cambridge, grew up in northwest London” that seems particularly successful - and so I’ve had feedback on these ideas. These guys say that they see themselves in these quotes.</p><p>  One useful trait is an extreme ability for self-control and rational thinking under <strong>pressure</strong>:</p></div><blockquote><p>"Bill [Gross] was to a large extent a trend follower, but he had a unique ability to know when it was time to lean against that trend and take a contrary position. There were numerous occasions where everyone else was scared shitless, and Bill put on his seat belt."</p><p> Pimco partner Ben Trosky, quoted in <em>The Bond King</em></p><p><br> "When the financial stakes were high, though, [Steve] Cohen demonstrated an almost inhuman ability to stay calm and make rational trading decisions.<br> …<br> It was practically a genetic anomaly, this ability to behave like a reptile when he was trading, as opposed to a human being prone to fear and self-doubt. When he interviewed new hires he tried to test for this quality as best he could."</p><p>Sheelah Kolhatkar, <a href="https://www.felixstocker.com/blog/black-edge"><em>Black Edge</em></a></p></blockquote><p>Another is being <strong>inscrutable</strong>.&nbsp; For example, people talked about John Meriwether from LTCM like this: </p><blockquote><p> “John has a steel-trap mind. You have no clue what he's thinking.”<br> </p><p>William McIntosh (who hired Meriwether into Salomon Brothers), quoted in <em>When Genius Failed</em> </p><p><strong>“</strong>He wore the same blank half-tense expression when he won as he did when he lost. He had, I think, a profound ability to control the two emotions that commonly destroy traders - fear and greed - and it made him as noble as a man who pursues his own interest so fiercely can be."</p><p>Michael Lewis, writing about Meriwether’s time at Salomon in <em>Liar’s Poker</em></p></blockquote><p>Mostly, though, the key is to be an <strong>obsessive</strong>:</p><blockquote><p> “My interview with the company - that is, with [Thomas] Peterffy - was memorable. It took place it his apartment in Greenwich, where his butler (his butler!) served us drinks. I made an offhand joke about programming, and he chided me for not having respect for the practice. He told me: '<strong>To be successful in this business, you have to think about it all the time. Lots of people in this business are very smart, but not everyone can think about it all the time</strong>.' These words - <em>you have to think about it all the time</em> - made a deep impression on me. Peterffy's phrase has pretty much become my motto - at least, it's one of them. At the time, I was struck by how simple and obvious it was. In fact, it was exactly what I did when I was faced with a complex programming challenge.”</p><p>Igor Tulchinsky, talking about how he came to work at Timber Hill (a Connecticut prop trading firm) in <em>The Unrules</em></p><p> "Intentionally isolated, he said, 'a quiet oasis of serenity.'</p><p> Serene for him, maybe, but his personality mangled whatever peace the rest of them could have enjoyed. The place was suffused with Gross's clinical insecurity that someone might catch up, that someone might threaten Pimco's dominance.</p><p> No moment wasted, no dollar left unsqueezed. This was the dominant culture, trickled down from the trade floor: Gross's 'Pimbots' ground their teeth in their sleep and woke up screaming: their marriages and livers disintegrated. It was precisely that they <em>were</em> so intensely obsessive, going beyond what everyone else did, that made them so great, they had to convince themselves...&nbsp;</p><p> Failure to deliver wasn't tolerated. Pimco would sniff out anyone's weakness."</p><p> Mary Childs discussing Bill Gross’s decision to locate Pimco in Newport Beach, in <em>The Bond King</em></p></blockquote><p><br> And finally, a quote that hits the nail on the head - even though it doesn’t come from a trader:</p><blockquote><p>"A man has to live and sleep with his business if he wants to make a go of it. You have to take it home with you at night, so you can lie there in the darkness and figure out what you can do to improve it. In fact, you have to become sort of a 'nut' about it, so that you become so enthused that you will bore your friends talking about it. You have to be a one-man crusade."</p><p>George Mecherle’s answer to the question, “what is the secret of your success?”, in <a href="https://www.felixstocker.com/blog/mecherle"><em>The Farmer from Merna</em></a> </p></blockquote><p> Nassim Taleb once said, "unless you're a trader, don't trade. Unless you're a baker, don't bake. Unless you're a dynamite maker, don't make dynamite." I think unless you can see yourself in at least some of those quotes, you probably shouldn’t be a trader.</p>

  <p> I once spent a huge amount of effort on something in which I had zero natural talent.&nbsp;</p><p> I started playing rugby at seven years old. I was always pretty useless, but I always tried really hard. I remember deciding age 12 that I wanted to be better, so one day, at my (boarding) prep school, I woke up early, got a tackle bag, and started doing tackle practice - on my own, at 7am. A teacher walked by, and said ‘<em>what </em>are you doing?’ Slightly sheepishly, I packed up the bag and went back inside. I didn’t get picked to go on the rugby tour, and never played for the U13 A team. When I went to secondary school, I was, again, rubbish - I think at one point I played for the U14 D team. And then, in October 2014, Bath, my favourite rugby union team, signed Sam Burgess: the Yorkshire-born Australian rugby league star. I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9serX3qmiw">his documentary on YouTube</a>, and it changed my life. The Russell Crowe narration at the start made a huge impression on me:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>“Now I have this theory about a certain kind of player. Like a Ron Coote, a Steve Menzies, a Gorden Tallis. I call it the Sparkly-Eyed Man. He’s a man who can be as vicious as he needs to be over the course of eighty minutes to get a result for his team. And the moment that final whistle is blown he’s a completely different person. He’s able to laugh easily, he’s good with kids, respectful to women, and he appreciates life. Which is why he’s the Sparkly-Eyed Man. He has that thing built within him to never quit, and if you’re going to do something, you do it to the absolute utmost of your ability. Those sparkly-eyed men, they carve their names deep in Rugby League.”</p></blockquote><p> Sam Burgess won the 2014 NRL Grand Final with South Sydney, just before he left for Bath. He broke his cheekbone in the opening tackle of the game, was man of the match, and won the Bunnies their first premiership in 43 years.</p>

  <p> This blew my mind. I wanted to be that guy. As a teenager, I absorbed all the sports motivational videos on YouTube. I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzm6TEManmQ">this one</a>, I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNA-JaCkvQg">this one</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epo4xUWGvNM">this one above all.</a> This stuff is <em>burned into the back of my skull</em>. I watched these things over and over again. I tried to figure out how to set them as an alarm.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><div><p> “When you immerse yourself in your craft, you not studying to get a grade, you’re not playing to score points, you immerse yourself in it, so you become it, you gon’ go to another level. </p><p> The most important thing is this: to be able to sacrifice yourself at any moment, to sacrifice what you are, for what you will become. Listen to me. Pain is temporary. It may last for a minute, or an hour, or a day, or even a year, but eventually it will subside. And something else will take its place. You ain’t gon’ die. At the end of pain is success! You’re not gon’ die because you’re feeling a little pain! I dare you to take a little pain. I dare you.</p><p>  Your life is in your hand. You are the captain of your ship. You could have, you could be, you could do whatever you want to do, remember boy, if it was easy, everybody would do it. It’s what they eat, it’s what they sleep, it’s what they drink, it possesses them.”</p></div></blockquote><div><p> So I decided I was going to play for the school first XV. I had about two and a half years to get ready. Let’s be honest, there wasn’t that much pain involved in that process - not like the pain Ray Lewis, who’s quoted in the speech above, <a href="https://youtu.be/h1dHZfD0O0s?si=GrMylN8ffC66qYN5">had growing up.</a> But this was the most<em> difficult a quest I could find</em>. A lot of people told me I couldn’t do it - my tutor, the U16A coach, <em>told me I’d never play for the first XV</em>.</p><p> I ate so much food I vomited. I drank a gallon of milk a day. I did squats until my nose bled. Here’s me, age 16, pulling 180 at Villain Strength in Mill Hill; and age 17, squatting 140x5 in my South Sydney jersey.</p></div>

They could <em>see</em> the game, they knew how to be in the right place at the right time, they could throw the final pass - and I had spent enough time <em>trying</em> to be like that that I knew I never could. I spent 8 years at school with a guy who’s probably going to be an Olympic hurdler this year; <em>he </em>had talent. And so it didn’t matter how many Tri-Nations games I watched or how many pushups I did, because I’d never get it like they did. I had worked as hard as I could, and it wasn’t ever going to be good enough.</p><p>  That was my Scott Alexander sweating blood experience. I learned what it felt like to stick with something. But my learning from that experience was that <em>next time</em> I should make sure I sweated blood working on a strength. Do more of what comes naturally.</p></div><div data-sqsp-text-block-content="" data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" data-sqsp-block="text" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1713830986192_9377"><p> I’ve spent the last few years trying to figure out what that is. I studied linear algebra, I read Marsilius of Padua, I wrote essays, I wrote SQL, I managed ad campaigns, I travelled the world selling software, I hired and fired a team, I tried to respond to messages in 10 seconds, I networked my way into industries and learned what makes them tick, and I raised some venture capital. Some of that felt natural; some of it didn’t. I’m still looking for what comes next. </p><p> I was in LA last week, on a mission to meet great people. The best person I met was the World’s Strongest Man, Martins Licis, at his gym in El Segundo. It was a complete accident; I didn’t know he was there, and I didn’t expect to work out that day. But the reason I was able to walk in and learn strongman from the best in the world was all those hours spent under a bar, squatting until my nose bled. </p><p>  So I guess it’s ok to bake bread even if you’re not a baker - we’re all allowed hobbies.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/x86-Opcodes-Not-AMD-Or-Intel">https://www.phoronix.com/news/x86-Opcodes-Not-AMD-Or-Intel</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45608285">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img alt="LINUX KERNEL" src="https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/linuxkernel.webp" width="100" height="100"></p><p>
Posted to the Linux kernel mailing list and GNU Binutils mailing list today is an intriguing message from a longtime x86/x86_64 expert around a "a corporate entity other than Intel/AMD" using some x86 opcodes not used by AMD or Intel processors.
</p><p>
Longtime x86 expert Christian Ludloff posted a cryptic message to the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAKSQd8WQDfSax83Fyja0Y_aF-jq+7qfOpDo3GU5bz-8wEVUA1A@mail.gmail.com/">LKML</a> and <a href="https://sourceware.org/pipermail/binutils/2025-October/144875.html">Binutils</a> mailing lists. An anonymous Phoronix reader in turn relayed the interesting occurrence to me. Christian Ludloff has worked for Google, AMD, TI, and others over the years as an x86 architecture expert as well as being known for his sandpile.org x86 CPU information site.
</p><p>
The subject for the mailing list posts by Christian Ludloff was <strong>x86 opcode/CPUID/MSR allocations</strong> and simply said:
</p><blockquote>"If x86 opcode/CPUID/MSR allocations are not of your concern, then you can stop reading.
<p>
-------------------- 8&lt; -------------------
</p><p>
I was asked to relay this to binutils/LKML.
</p><p>
As of 2025, the following are in active use by a corporate entity other than Intel/AMD.
</p><p>
Any collisions with them should be avoided.
</p><p>
- opcode 0Eh in PM64 - x86 PUSH CS that got removed by x86-64 in 2002; not used since
</p><p>
- opcode 0Fh,36h and opcode 0Fh,3Eh - there is a historic collision with Cyrix RDSHR, but that is not considered to be an issue
</p><p>
- opcode 0Fh,3Ah,E0h...EFh in classic, VEX, EVEX, Map3, and Map7 encodings, without a prefix, or CS/SS/DS/ES/FS/GS, LOCK, REPE/REPNE, or ASIZE/OSIZE/REX (but not REX2!) prefixes - a historic collision with K10M VCVTFXPNTPD2DQ (at MVEX opcode E6h prefix F2) exists but is not considered an issue
</p><p>
- opcode 0Fh,1Eh,/0 - a "hinting NOP" group
</p><p>
- CPUID range E000_xxxxh - unspecified leaf return values at this particular time
</p><p>
- MSR range E000_xxxxh - unspecified values after RESET - unchanged values after INIT
</p><p>
I have documented them at www.sandpile.org.
</p><p>
-------------------- 8&lt; -------------------
</p><p>

<br>C."</p></blockquote>
<p>These x86 opcodes and CPUs and MSR ranges now "<em>in active use by a corporate entity other than Intel/AMD</em>" makes this rather intriguing... And that it's a "corporate" entity rather than noting a research organization, hobbyist project, etc. And how said corporate entity has the legal ability to even work on a new x86-based implementation is interesting. For Christian Ludloff to be involved does give it additional weight.</p><p>As pointed out in the Phoronix Forums, it could be <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/search/Zhaoxin">Zhaoxin</a>. But as they have <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Zhaxoin-Shijidadao-GCC-15">contributed GCC patches</a>, Glibc patches, Linux kernel patches, etc, over the years it's not clear why they would go unnamed or have to relay the message via Ludloff rather than their prior direct mailing list posts.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2025&amp;image=x86_intrigue"></p>
<p>For now that's all I know but rather interesting seeing this message from Ludloff today on the public mailing lists.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>So I kept reading rumors that Gemini 3.0 is accessible through Google AI Studio through A/B testing and the SVGs folks were posting (of Xbox controllers in particular) made me think that they might be right.</p><p>Gemini 3.0 is one of the most anticipated releases in AI at the moment because of the expected advances in coding performance.</p><p>Evaluating models is a difficult task, but surprisingly the SVG generation task seems to be a very efficient proxy for gauging model quality as <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/pelican-riding-a-bicycle/">@simonw</a> has shown us using his “pelican riding a bicycle” test.</p><p>Lo and behold, after trying a couple of times I got the A/B screen and got an SVG image of an Xbox 360 controller that looked VERY impressive compared to the rest of the frontier.</p><p><img alt="Gemini 3.0 Xbox controller output" loading="lazy" src="https://ricklamers.io/gemini-3-xbox-controller.png"></p><p>The exact prompt I used:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>Create an SVG image of an Xbox 360 controller.

```
</code></pre><p>For what it’s worth the model ID for “Gemini 3.0” was <code>ecpt50a2y6mpgkcn</code> which doesn’t really help understand which version of the model it is. Perhaps since I user selected Gemini 2.5 Pro it is actually Gemini 3.0 Pro that it is pitted against, as comparing Gemini 3.0 Flash to Gemini 2.5 Pro in an A/B test makes less sense to me. Also, it had about 24s higher TTFT and output length was about 40% longer (this includes reasoning tokens AFAICT), but that doesn’t say much other than it’s likely not a “GPT-5 Pro” type answer that uses significant test time compute.</p><h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2><p>“Gemini 3.0” A/B result versus the Gemini 2.5 Pro model:</p><p><img alt="Gemini 3.0 vs Gemini 2.5 Pro comparison" loading="lazy" src="https://ricklamers.io/gemini-3-vs-2-5-comparison.png"></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>When we introduced the <a href="https://agentclientprotocol.com/">Agent Client Protocol (ACP)</a> in <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/bring-your-own-agent-to-zed">collaboration with Google's Gemini CLI team</a>, we did not anticipate how much pent-up demand there was for a protocol like this!</p>


<p>As of today, Zed supports Codex out-the-box via ACP. You can select it from the New Thread menu, just like Claude Code or Gemini CLI:</p>
<p><figure><video src="https://customer-snccc0j9v3kfzkif.cloudflarestream.com/33ed2569d4edb50dcaa1ddcc7db6857e/downloads/default.mp4" width="3840" height="2160" poster="https://zed.dev/img/post/acp-codex/video-poster.webp" controls=""></video><figcaption>A walkthrough of OpenAI's Codex in Zed.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Like our other ACP integrations, Codex via ACP is strictly about improving UI and keeping you in flow in your IDE of choice; the billing and legal/terms arrangement is directly between you and OpenAI. Zed does not charge for use of external agents like Codex, nor do prompts and code sent via Codex-ACP to OpenAI touch Zed's servers! We've also separately open-sourced the <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/codex-acp">codex-acp adapter</a> so you can use it outside of Zed as well.</p>
<h2 id="learning-from-different-agents"><a href="#learning-from-different-agents" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Learning from Different Agents</span></a></h2>
<p>Every model behaves a bit differently than the others, and the same is true of agents. For example, some agents
support switching models in the middle of a conversation, whereas others require sticking with the same model throughout.
Some support viewing and resuming past conversations, whereas others have no concept of conversation persistence.
ACP is designed to be flexible enough to work with a variety of agent capabilities, but the experience of using them
still varies based on the agent's implementation details.</p>
<p>A detail that came up when we were building the Codex ACP adapter was that the Codex agent runs terminal commands in its own process, and then streams output bytes from that terminal process to the client. In the past, we've had this reversed: the
agent would send the client a request to run a terminal command (e.g. <code>mkdir examples</code>) and then the client would manage
the actual running of that command.</p>
<p>Naturally, we want to keep the look and feel consistent no matter which agent you're using, but this design difference
between Codex and other agents makes certain details unavoidably different. For example, for other agents we can spawn
terminals in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoterminal">pseudoterminal (PTY)</a> mode. This means you can actually interact
with the terminal right in the Agent Panel if the agent launches an interactive process, and it also means things like
colorful terminal output tend to be enabled by default.</p>
<p>On the other hand, being in PTY mode means that an agent can get stuck. A classic example of this is when an agent tries to
run <code>git rebase --continue</code> and the terminal pops up the configured editor, then waits for the programmer to make any
edits (if desired) to the commit message. This can be nice for a human, but for an agent that's waiting for the command to
finish, it creates a deadlock. The process won't proceed without interaction, and the agent won't interact until the process
completes! Having terminals work in non-PTY mode might result in fewer colors and less interactivity, but it also results in
fewer cases of agents getting stuck.</p>
<p>Now that we've integrated agents that both enable and disable PTY mode, we can compare how the experience feels in both cases, and use that to inform our recommendations for future ACP integrations.</p>
<h2 id="which-acp-integration-is-next"><a href="#which-acp-integration-is-next" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Which ACP Integration is Next?</span></a></h2>
<p>In addition to Codex, we have already added support to Zed for Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/acp-progress-report#agents-more-options-for-developers">other agents</a>, all via ACP. Since ACP is not specific to Zed,
we've also seen it be adopted by editors like Neovim, Emacs, and now the <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/ai/2025/10/jetbrains-zed-open-interoperability-for-ai-coding-agents-in-your-ide/">JetBrains family of IDEs</a>.</p>
<p>Now that the protocol has picked up enough adoption on its own, we're happy to shift our focus to working with the community on the future of the protocol—as opposed to building ACP adapters ourselves like we did with Codex and Claude Code. We're excited to see what amazing ACP integrations the community cooks up!</p><hr><div><h3 id="looking-for-a-better-editor">Looking for a better editor?</h3>

            <p>EA employees and the Communications Workers of America union have issued a statement against the proposed private acquisition of the company, claiming they were not represented in the negotiations and any jobs lost as a result would "be a choice, not a necessity, made to pad investors' pockets".</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">acquisition of EA by a group of private investors</a> was announced at the end of September. The deal, for $55bn, includes investment from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Affinity Partners, the company of President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p>
<p>Following the announcement, there's been plenty of speculation around the future of EA and its multiple owned studios, split between EA Sports and EA Entertainment. Now, members of the United Videogame Workers union and the CWA have <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/united-videogame-workers-cwa-statement-proposed-electronic-arts-buyout">issued a formal response</a> alongside a <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/make-ea-better">petition for regulators to scrutinise the deal</a>.</p>
<p>"EA is not a struggling company," the statement reads. "With annual revenues reaching $7.5 billion and $1 billion in profit each year, EA is one of the largest video game developers and publishers in the world."</p>
<p>This success has been driven by company workers, the union stated. "Yet we, the very people who will be jeopardised as a result of this deal, were not represented at all when this buyout was negotiated or discussed."</p>
<p>Citing the number of layoffs across the industry since 2022, workers fear for "the future of our studios that are arbitrarily deemed 'less profitable' but whose contributions to the video game industry define EA's reputation."</p>
<p>"If jobs are lost or studios are closed due to this deal, that would be a choice, not a necessity, made to pad investors' pockets - not to strengthen the company," the statement reads.</p>
<p>"Every time private equity or billionaire investors take a studio private, workers lose visibility, transparency, and power," it continues. "Decisions that shape our jobs, our art, and our futures are made behind closed doors by executives who have never written a line of code, built worlds, or supported live services. We are calling on regulators and elected officials to scrutinise this deal and ensure that any path forward protects jobs, preserves creative freedom, and keeps decision-making accountable to the workers who make EA successful."</p>
<p>As such, workers have launched a petition in a "fight to make video games better for workers and players - not billionaires".</p>
<p>The statement concludes: "The value of video games is in their workers. As a unified voice, we, the members of the industry-wide video game workers' union UVW-CWA, are standing together and refusing to let corporate greed decide the future of our industry."</p>
<p>Eurogamer contacted the Federal Trade Commission following news of the proposed acquisition of EA, but it refused to comment "on pending mergers or acquisitions".</p>
<p>A report from The Financial Times suggested the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-private-acquisition-deal-expected-to-go-smoothly-says-report-as-what-regulator-is-going-to-say-no-to-the-presidents-son-in-law">deal won't face much opposition</a>. As one source said: "What regulator is going to say no to the president's son-in-law?"</p>
<p>Eurogamer also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-takeover-the-saudi-arabian-public-investment-fund-and-vanity-mega-projects-human-rights-watch-assesses-the-impact-of-gamings-latest-controversy">spoke with the Human Rights Watch on the controversial acquisition</a>. "We have found that the public investment fund has contributed to, and is responsible for, human rights abuses," said researcher Joey Shea on the involvement of Saudi Arabia's government. "This is a trillion dollars in Saudi state wealth that should be invested to realise the economic and social rights of Saudi citizens. We've found it's been invested in vanity mega projects inside and outside of the country.</p><p>"We see this as a deliberate attempt to distract from the country's human rights abuses [...] MBS himself wields enormous power over what is effectively public funds, and he wields this power in a highly arbitrary and personalised manner, rather than the benefit of the Saudi people more broadly. Effectively, Saudi Arabia's vast fossil fuel-derived state wealth is controlled by one person, which isn't good for human rights, or business either."</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/new-alpha-release-tor-browser-150a4/">https://blog.torproject.org/new-alpha-release-tor-browser-150a4/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45605842">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tor Browser 15.0a4 is now available from the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/alpha/">Tor Browser download page</a> and also from our <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/15.0a4/">distribution directory</a>.</p>
<p>This version includes important <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/">security updates</a> to Firefox.</p>
<h2>Release Candidate</h2>
<p>If all goes as planned, this will be our last alpha release in the 15.0 series before it is promoted to stable in the last week of October. Next week we will be focusing primarily on QA and ensuring all the various features and scenarios supported in Tor Browser still work as expected. This QA work will be tracked in the following gitlab issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/43894">tor-browser#43984 - Tor Browser 15.0 Release QA - Desktop </a></li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/43895">tor-browser#43985 - Tor Browser 15.0 Release QA - Android </a></li>
</ul>
<p>As we reach the home stretch, now would be a great time to download and try out Tor Browser Alpha! We would appreciate it if the community would evaluate and exercise these following changes:</p>
<h3>🤖 Removal of Various AI Features</h3>
<p>Over the past year Mozilla has been working on integrating various AI features and integrations into Firefox (e.g. <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/ai-chatbot">the AI chatbot sidebar</a>). Such machine learning systems and platforms are inherently un-auditable from a security and privacy perspective. We also do not want to imply recommendation or promotion of such systems by including them in Tor Browser. Therefore, we have done what we can to remove such features from the browser.</p>
<h3>☁️ Rename <code>meek-azure</code> pluggable-transport to just <code>meek</code></h3>
<p>In the past, we have used various cloud platform to host <code>meek</code> pluggable-transport backends including Google, Amazon, and Azure. However, as time passed these backends have moved and migrated and thus the cloud provider-specific name has become an historical artifact. Therefore, we have <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/44069">dropped the Azure part of the name</a> and now just call it <code>meek</code>. Let this be a lesson to you about naming things!</p>
<h3>🟪 Improved Dark Theme Support in Browser Chrome</h3>
<p>We have improved the styling for our various Tor Browser-specific UI components for  dark browser themes. All of our various purple elements should now look like they belong.</p>
<h3>🦊 Removal/Replacement of New Firefox/Mozilla-specific Branding and Features</h3>
<p>As part of ordinary incremental UI updates over the past year and the implementation of new features, Mozilla has added various new brand assets and service integrations. This includes things like those cute little fox graphics, Firefox Home, and the new History Sidebar. As of this release, there should not be any more Firefox or Mozilla specific branding, features, or service integrations accessible in Tor Browser. The new history sidebar in particular has been <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/44108">replaced with the legacy history panel</a> from previous Tor Browser versions.</p>
<h3>🐧 Updated Emoji Font for Linux</h3>
<p>We have included the <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser-build/-/issues/41561">Noto Color Emoji font</a> with our Linux builds. Linux users should now have all the latest and greatest emoji provided by <a href="https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji/">Noto Emoji</a>.</p>
<h3>🈴️ Improved CJK Glyph Rendering</h3>
<p>At the <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/44227">suggestion of a cypherpunk</a>, we have swapped out the Noto font family for <a href="https://kamichikoichi.github.io/jigmo/">Jigmo</a>. This <em>should</em> allow more Chinese, Japanese, and Korean graphemes to render accurately in web content.</p>
<h3>✉️ Letterboxing Styling Improvements</h3>
<p>We have tweaked our custom styling of the web-content letterboxing feature to confirm with and adapt to Firefox's own styling changes in Firefox 140. These tweaks should also play nicely with upstream's vertical tabs feature.</p>
<h3>🚫 WebAssembly Restrictions Now Managed by NoScript</h3>
<p>Historically, we have disabled <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly">WebAssembly</a> globally when the browser is in the  <code>Safer</code> and <code>Safest</code> security levels. However, with the latest Firefox version this has proven to be too aggressive, as doing so <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/44234">broke functionality in the built-in PDF reader</a>. We therefore now rely on the <a href="https://noscript.net/">NoScript extension</a> built into the browser to handle disabling WebAssembly functionality in web content while the browser is in the <code>Safer</code> and <code>Safest</code> security levels, while also allowing WebAssembly to run unhindered in safe+privileged contexts like the PDF reader.</p>
<h3>🔍 Stopped Hiding Protocol in URL on Desktop</h3>
<p>Mozilla has reversed course on when the protocol portion (e.g. <code>http</code> or <code>https</code>) of the URL in the URL bar is hidden since Firefox 128. We used to have logic in one of our patches around Onion Services (which are always end-to-end encrypted regardless of the application-level protocol used) to follow whatever Firefox does for <code>https</code>. However, with the latest changes in Firefox, this patch became a bit gnarly to apply correctly so we took a step back and thought to ourselves, why are we even conditionally hiding this from the user?</p>
<p>So for now, we have decided <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/44123">not to hide the protocol from the user on Desktop platforms</a> using a supported Firefox pref. We continue to follow upstream and <em>always</em> hide the protocol in the URL bar on Android (where horizontal space is at a premium). Users of Tor Browser Android can simply click the icon in the URL bar to get all the info about a websites HTTPS usage.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>First things first, why do we code? To solve problems in the most optimal way possible.</p>

      <p>
        For me, the number one factor is speed: both application speed and development speed.
        That’s exactly what led me to <strong><a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org/" target="_blank">Phoenix LiveView</a></strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If I had chosen React or Next.js with Laravel, or even Inertia.js with Laravel,
        I would have had to maintain both sides of the stack, frontend and backend.
        As a solo developer, I didn’t have the time to manage state in two different places.
        I needed a solid monolithic solution that could handle everything together.
      </p>

      <p>
        So I looked into Laravel Livewire and Rails Hotwire. Both are great tools that simplify frontend work
        without depending too much on JavaScript. I even thought about going full JavaScript with Next.js,
        but I’ve never been a big fan of using JS on the backend.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rails Hotwire really caught my attention, especially because of how fast you can build an MVP with Rails.
        But I still needed background jobs, real-time updates, and two-way communication that just works.
        Those things are possible in Rails and Laravel, but they take a bit more effort to set up.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then I came across <strong>Elixir</strong> and its framework <strong>Phoenix</strong>.
        It had all the elegance of Ruby on Rails, but with far better performance.
        It came with built-in <strong><a href="https://github.com/oban-bg/oban" target="_blank">background jobs through Oban</a></strong>, a familiar and clean syntax,
        and something truly special called <strong>LiveView</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        LiveView feels like the perfect balance between traditional server-rendered apps and frontend-heavy frameworks.
        It’s way ahead of both Rails Hotwire and Laravel Livewire. LiveView communicates through WebSockets,
        which means real-time two-way updates without sending new requests every time something changes.
        You can still use <strong>Alpine.js</strong> or any JavaScript library you want through hooks when needed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Phoenix also comes with <strong>Oban</strong> jobs built in. You can declare background jobs easily,
        and when something fails, it automatically restarts without breaking the app.
        That’s the beauty of Elixir. It’s a compiled language built on top of Erlang,
        which powers highly concurrent systems like WhatsApp and Discord.
      </p>

      <h2>Here’s what sealed it for me:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I can build fast</li>
        <li>I can handle high concurrency if needed</li>
        <li>I write almost everything in one language</li>
        <li>I can write clean, readable code</li>
        <li>The compiler catches most bugs before they reach production</li>
        <li>The app is fault tolerant and rarely goes down</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I’m not saying Phoenix is better than Laravel, Rails, or Next.js. All of these are excellent frameworks, and I’ve personally used them to build applications. Phoenix just turned out to be the best fit for my specific use case. This is my project - <a href="https://hyperzoned.com/?ref=akarshc.com" target="_blank">Hyperzoned.com</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        I don’t know who needs to hear this, but try exploring beyond what you already know.
        You might find a better and more efficient way to solve your next problem.
        After all, never stop learning.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<div><p>This article is about a new kind of simple computational rule (“LACE rules” running on LACE, the Link Automata Computing Engine platform) which, when applied locally on a grid of cells, demonstrates fascinating emergent “artificial life” behavior. </p><p>For readers familiar with the Game of Life (GOL), this is a next-level class of cellular automata that utilizes neighborhood topology — the state of the grid is a function of both cell states and their connectivity (links).</p><p>To quickly get a sense of what LACE does – scroll down in this post to the video <strong>Gallery section</strong> and take a look at (a) the <a href="https://videopress.com/v/lTZ8e4hD" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Game of Life, with links</a>, and then as a comparison, check out (b) the “<a href="https://videopress.com/v/lQ5Bghsj" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Amazing Dragons</a>” LACE rule, and the many other “Realm of LACE” (ROL) rules that fully utilize topology.</p></div>



<h2>Preamble</h2>



<div><p>I have been thinking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">cellular automata</a> ever since I read a fascinating and important book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Three-Scientists-Their-Gods-Information/dp/0060972572" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Three Scientists and Their Gods</a>, during the summer of my sophomore year of college. This book changed my life. </p><p>After reading this book ferociously on the drive home from Oberlin college to Boston, for summer vacation, I became obsessed with the idea of digital physics – and particularly with the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Fredkin" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Ed Fredkin</a>, (and later <a href="https://www.stephenwolfram.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Stephen Wolfram</a> as well). </p></div>



<p>And so I decided I had to find a way to get into Ed Fredkin’s lab at MIT. This became my mission in life</p>



<p>Finally, after many attempts, I did managed to finagle a summer internship in his lab at MIT, thanks to the kindness of Professors <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/nhm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Norman Margolus</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommaso_Toffoli" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Tommaso Toffolli</a>, two of the great minds in the field. They had authored an MIT Press book that I had found and read countless times, <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262200608/cellular-automata-machines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Cellular Automata Machines</a>, which at the time was the bible in the field.</p>



<div><p>In their lab they had built a specialized supercomputer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">CAM-6</a>, for digital physics simulations. I spent every minute of that summer in their lab on CAM-6, exploring the computational universe. </p><p>For years after that internship, I filled dozens of journals with detailed ideas and theories about digital physics. I wrote code, I tested ideas, I learned and explored. But nothing really came close to the richness and complexity of the vision I had experienced, or our actual natural world. </p><p>These digital models were lacking something, but I wasn’t sure what. </p><p>Then, years later, it became more clear. </p><p>The topology of spacetime is not merely a fixed set of locations and states, <em>it’s a graph.</em> The links between things <em>are important</em>. (Note: As Stephen Wolfram would later point out to me, this idea harkens back to the dialectical debate between the views of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spacetime-theories-classical/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Newton and Leibniz</a>).</p></div>



<p>I needed a new kind of model, one where the shape of space could evolve, one where the shape of space could affect matter, and where matter could affect the shape of space, because after all, according to Einstein, they are really the same thing.</p>



<div><p>And from this insight I then undertook decades of exploration into the idea of a new kind of cellular automata — one in which the cells had links to each other, which could also figure into their states. Both the cell states and link states could interact, forming complex topologies and geometries. </p><p>Decades went by, along with many experiments that did not bear fruit. </p><p>But last year, I actually built something that demonstrates this new class of CA rather nicely. </p><p>Now I’m finally getting around to posting it…</p></div>



<h2>Introducing LACE: The Link Automata Computing Engine</h2>



<div><p>LACE is a new experimental platform written in python, for exploring a class of cellular automata in which both the states of cells and their connections (links) to each other are subject to the rules.</p><p>In LACE, the state of a cell is a function of both its neighbors AND the links it has to them, and link states in turn are a function of the cells they connect.</p><p>LACE rules can use topological properties of cells and neighborhoods, such as number of connections, neighbor degree, and other metrics.</p></div>



<div><p>This enables rules in which virtual neighborhood topology (the links) affects neighborhood states — rules in which topology can both evolve and shape the behavior of the system, and in which the behavior of the system can shape topology.</p><p>The added topological dimension enables rules that can have more interesting behavior than traditional “cells-only” CA rules, opening up a fascinating new computational vista (within Wolfram’s, <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Ruliad</a>) of new kinds of rules that generate new species of stable patterns – oscillators – gliders, puffers, and more.</p></div>



<p>LACE rules range from link-aware variants of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Conway’s famous Game of Life</a>, but where edges have varying degrees of influence, to completely new kinds of “Realm of LACE” rules that use topological metrics in their computations. In theory, these rules could even be utilized to simulate neural networks.</p>



<div><p>What is fascinating about these new link-aware “Realm of LACE rules” is that they exhibit amazing new forms of stability and periodic structure. They produce new kinds of periodic gliders, oscillators, puffers, and other kinds of phenomena. Some of them even have behaviors that resemble forms of “artificial life.”</p><p>For more details on how these rules work, get the repo and open various rules in the rule editor, where all their parameters are explained. There are many new classes of rules to experiment with.</p></div>



<h2>The Code</h2>



<p><strong>You can read more about LACE </strong><a href="https://github.com/novaspivack/lace/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong>You can get the LACE python code repo</strong> <a href="https://github.com/novaspivack/lace/tree/master/LACE" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">here</a>.</p>



<h2>The Gallery</h2>



<p><em><strong>(NOTE – click on the videos and use the settings icon to set quality to 1080p for best visuals)</strong></em></p>



<div><p><strong>First, let’s take a look at Conway’s Game of Life, but with links visible.</strong> This demonstration simply shows the links and their states, but in this example, the links do not affect the states of cells. This shows that LACE can run traditional 2D cellular automata rules, with the links visible, but without the links changing rule behavior.</p><p>In more sophisticated LACE rules (scroll down), we will actually modify the behavior of the Life rule based on the links</p></div>

<p>And here are some Life gliders, doing their thing, with links visible…</p>



		<figure>
			
			
			
		</figure>
		


<p>And here is a stable pattern in Life… with links….</p>



		<figure>
			
			
			
		</figure>
		


<p>Now, here is a version of Life, where edges influence rule behavior…</p>



		<figure>
			
			
			
		</figure>
		


<div><p>Here’s a variant of Life where edges play even more of a role. </p><p>In LACE we can adjust the influence that links have on rule behavior – from none (links are merely decorative), to strong influence (links condition cell states).</p></div>



		<figure>
			
			
			
		</figure>
		


<div><p>Above, we looked at some traditional Life rule cellular automata. These examples illustrated varying levels of link-awareness in rules. But they are still not showing the full capabilities of the LACE platform.</p><p>Next, we turn to more advanced LACE rules that fully utilize the capabilities of the system…</p></div>



<h2>The Realm of LACE: LACE Rules </h2>



<p><strong>Now, take a look at the “Amazing Dragons” rule in the Realm of LACE (ROL), one of the more interesting rules in this universe. </strong></p>



<p><strong>This is not a life rule – it’s a LACE rule – a fully topological rule. </strong></p>



<div><p><strong>Here links and neighborhood topology play a major role in the behavior of cell states and cell states modify the states of links as well.</strong></p><p>(Here’s a little more detail on how rules work – see <a href="https://github.com/novaspivack/lace/blob/master/Rule_Explanation_Realm_of_Lace_Betweenness_Dragons.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">this</a> and <a href="https://github.com/novaspivack/lace/blob/master/Rule_Explanation_Realm_of_Lace_Betweenness_Dragons.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">this</a> and a longer explanation <a href="https://github.com/novaspivack/lace/blob/master/Realm_of_Lace_Unified_Complete_Guide.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">here</a>)</p></div>



<p><strong>…and look what happens!</strong></p>



		<figure>
			
			
			
		</figure>
		


<p>LACE also supports an optional high-performance, GPU-accelerated mode using Taichi, for large-scale simulations…</p>



		<figure>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/current/news/mc2-how-electricity-can-heal-wounds-three-times-as-fast/">https://www.chalmers.se/en/current/news/mc2-how-electricity-can-heal-wounds-three-times-as-fast/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45604779">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“Chronic wounds are a huge societal problem that we don’t hear a lot about. Our discovery of a method that may heal wounds up to three times faster can be a game changer for diabetic and elderly people, among others, who often suffer greatly from wounds that won’t heal,” says Maria Asplund, Professor of Bioelectronics at Chalmers University of Technology and head of research on the project.</p>
<h3><br>Electric guidance of cells for faster healing</h3>
<p>The researchers worked from an old hypothesis that electric stimulation of damaged skin can be used to heal wounds. The idea is that skin cells are electrotactic, which means that they directionally ‘migrate’ in electric fields. This means that if an electric field is placed in a petri dish with skin cells, the cells stop moving randomly and start moving in the same direction. The researchers investigated how this principle can be used to electrically guide the cells in order to make wounds heal faster. Using a tiny engineered chip, the researchers were able to compare wound healing in artificial skin, stimulating one wound with electricity and letting one heal without electricity. The differences were striking.</p>
<p>“We were able to show that the old hypothesis about electric stimulation can be used to make wounds heal significantly faster. In order to study exactly how this works for wounds, we developed a kind of biochip on which we cultured skin cells, which we then made tiny wounds in. Then we stimulated one wound with an electric field, which clearly led to it healing three times as fast as the wound that healed without electric stimulation,” Asplund says.</p>
<h3>Hope for diabetes patients</h3>
<p><strong><a rel="noopener" href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/LC/D2LC01045C" target="_blank">In the study,</a></strong> the researchers also focused on wound healing in connection with diabetes, a growing health problem worldwide. One in 11 adults today has some form of diabetes according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Diabetes Federation.</p>
<p>“We’ve looked at diabetes models of wounds and investigated whether our method could be effective even in those cases. We saw that when we mimic diabetes in the cells, the wounds on the chip heal very slowly. However, with electric stimulation we can increase the speed of healing so that the diabetes-affected cells almost correspond to healthy skin cells,” Asplund says.</p>
<h3>Individualised treatment the next step</h3>
<p>The Chalmers researchers recently received a large grant which will allow them to continue their research in the field, and in the long run enable the development of wound healing products for consumers on the market. Similar products have come out before, but more basic research is required to develop effective products that generate enough electric field strength and stimulate in the right way for each individual. This is where Asplund and her colleagues come into the picture:</p>
<p>“We are now looking at how different skin cells interact during stimulation, to take a step closer to a realistic wound. We want to develop a concept to be able to ‘scan’ wounds and adapt the stimulation based on the individual wound. We are convinced that this is the key to effectively helping individuals with slow-healing wounds in the future,” Asplund says.</p>
<h3>More about the study:</h3>
<div><p>• <a rel="noopener" href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/LC/D2LC01045C" target="_blank">“Bioelectronic microfluidic wound healing: a platform for investigating direct current stimulation of injured cell collectives”</a> was published in the journal Lab on a Chip. The article was written by Sebastian Shaner, Anna Savelyeva, Anja Kvartuh, Nicole Jedrusik, Lukas Matter, José Leal and Maria Asplund. The researchers work at the University of Freiburg in Germany and Chalmers University of Technology. </p><p>• In their study, the researchers showed that wound healing on artificial skin stimulated with electric current was three times faster than on the skin that healed naturally. The electric field was low, about 200 mV/mm, and did not have a negative impact on the cells. </p><p>• The method the researchers developed is based on a microfluidic biochip on which artificial skin can be grown, stimulated with an electric current and studied in an effective and controlled manner. The concept allows researchers to conduct multiple experiments in parallel on the same chip. </p><p>• The research project began in 2018 and is funded by the European Research Council (ERC). The project was recently granted new funding so the research can get to market and benefit patients.</p></div>

        <h2>Backend-driven interactive apps</h2>
        <p>
            Hyperflask is built on top of <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/">Flask</a>, a popular Python web framework. It is easy to use and master. Backend-driven apps ensure straighforward state management and limit a lot of footguns from frontend-heavy apps. Combined with <a href="https://htmx.org/">HTMX</a> and a component system, creating interactive apps is easier than ever.

        <h2>A powerful component system</h2>
        <p>
            Hyperflask introduces component-driven architecture to Flask apps. Seamlessly create frontend (web components, react, etc...) and backend components and use them in your jinja templates. Use HTMX to create server-backed interactive components.

        <h2>File-based routing</h2>
        <p>
            Hyperflask extends Flask with many powerful features, notably file-based routing using a new file format that combines python code and a jinja template (inspired by Astro pages).

        <h2>Ensuring a thriving ecosystem</h2>
        <p>
            The Hyperflask framework itself is a small code base. It combines many Flask extensions in a seamless manner.
            All extensions and related projects are developed independently of the framework under the Hyperflask organization.
            Feel free to pick and choose the part you prefer from Hyperflask and use them in your own projects.

					<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p><em>Skibidi Toilet</em> began as an animated YouTube Web series early in 2023 that quickly spiralled into a wildly popular cultural phenomenon sprouting fandoms, wikis, threads, merchandise, and its very own moral panic (McKinnon and Harmon). It has recently grabbed the attention of Hollywood, and there are rumours that it is on its way to TV and a possible film treatment by Michael Bay (Wallenstein and Steiner). The episodes are short, surreal videos featuring bizarre, monstrous characters embroiled in violent clashes—to the non-stop repetition of “skibidi dom dom dom yes yes.” Kids love it, and some parents want it banned (<em>10Play</em>). This article will think about how we might read <em>Skibidi</em>’s playfulness with ‘humanoid surveillance robots’ and other tropes and strange creatures, as the <em>Skibidi</em> fandom is flirting with fairly dense social and political issues, such as the global surveillance apparatus and the potential corporate annihilation of the ‘natural’ world.</p>
<p>The series follows an increasingly epic war between two factions: the antagonists who take the form of human-headed singing toilets, led by G-man—or G-Toilet—and a group of mechanical humanoids with cameras, TVs, and speakers for heads, called The Alliance (or informally, Cameraheads). The bulk of the early action takes place in a generic cityscape littered with grey office buildings, called Metropolis (<em>Skibidi Toilet Wiki</em>), which conjures dystopian visions of a world stripped of vibrancy and plant life (except for what looks like an artificial lawn). An unlicensed mashup of the songs ‘Give It to Me’ by Timbaland and ‘Dom Dom Yes Yes’ by Bulgarian artist Biser King created by TikTok user @doombreaker03 appears in each episode as the theme of the <em>Skibidi Toilets</em>, further remixed with other familiar themes in various episodes, like "The Imperial March (Darth Vader’s Theme)" from <em>Star Wars</em>. The actual word ‘Skibidi’ seems to be taken from the viral hit of the same name from the band Little Big, ostensibly, meaning absolutely nothing. The first episodes were released through YouTube shorts, with multiple episodes clustered as one-minute “seasons” in vertical format. As the popularity of <em>Skibidi Toilet</em> grew, the story has become increasingly elaborate, and the individual episodes have transitioned to wide-screen format with longer run times. The total run time (as of September 2024) for all 76 episodes is 1 hour and 55 minutes.</p>
<p>The creator is Georgian Youtuber and animator Alexey Gerasimov, who has been sharing videos on social media under the moniker DaFuq?!Boom! since 2017. His absurdist creations are typically made using the Source Filmmaker (SFM) tool (considered a fairly basic computer graphics software tool available for free), with crude animations featuring non-playable characters (NPCs) from the <em>Half-Life 2</em> video game. Source Filmmaker content can be seen as an evolution of the machinima creations of the noughties and 2010s. The word ‘machinima’ is a portmanteau of ‘machine’ and ‘cinema’ and refers to fans using game engines or gaming platforms to create their own stories in real-time (Harwood).</p>
<p><em>Skibidi Toilet</em> has grown out of a context of infinitely converging technologies and subcultures. It is also born from the themes, software, content, and media that are most popular in gamer/maker communities, a high proportion of which are populated by younger people with a strong uptake in collaborative gaming trends (Schomer; Crowe and Bradford). This younger demographic is popularly referred to as Gen Alpha, representing those born after the year 2000—the first cohort to live entirely within the twenty-first century’s digital environment (Boczkowski and Mitchelstein). Machinima writer Katie Salen calls this the “generation of kids born into games” (38). As such, it is appropriate to read <em>Skibidi</em> as an epicentre of Gen Alpha sensibility. In an article revealing that <em>Skibidi</em> may be in development for a TV and film treatment by Michael Bay, <em>Variety</em> reporters Andrew Wallenstein and Robert Steiner remark that <em>Skibidi</em> is “explosive, violent and free of any discernible dialogue” and it is these qualities that have “won it a worldwide audience, not to mention the distinction of being a cultural icon Generation Alpha can truly call its own” (Wallenstein and Steiner).</p>
<p>Gen Alpha may be "born into video games", but they have also been born into a disintegrating climate system, post-9/11 politics (such as the global austerity crisis, perpetual war, and the rise of right-wing populism), surveillance capitalism, and pandemic risk—much of which can be read in the landscapes and metaphors of <em>Skibidi Toilet</em>, serving to problematise notions of the ‘natural’ and the limits of the human in the context of climate catastrophe and technological transformation. It is therefore our contention that <em>Skibidi Toilet</em> functions as an artefact that both produces and reflects cultural anxieties and troubles experienced by the Gen Alpha zeitgeist. Finally, due to the entangled nature of participatory culture—and the ways in which <em>Skibidi</em> takes co-created media to the extreme by way of circulating and re-circulated fan-generated content—we are reading both the actors of these networks (as audiences as much as producers) and the texts as conjoined digital artefacts (Mayer).</p>
<h2><strong>Artificiality and the Monstrous Digital</strong></h2>
<p><em>Skibidi Toilet</em> features a banquet of monstrosities that distort a sense of the ‘natural’ world in some way. <em>Skibidi Toilet</em> not only features nightmarish hybrids that confuse boundaries between the organic, mechanical, and digital, but as a media artefact, it also takes place <em>on and in</em> the digital space. As such, we characterise this phenomenon within the scope of what we call the ‘monstrous digital’ in that <em>Skibidi Toilet</em> is relational to, and dependent on, the digital space in content, format, and sensibility. While the monstrous digital could be applied to an endless list of examples and subject matter in the story world of <em>Skibidi Toilet</em>, we apply it specifically to analyse the threat suggested by humanity’s tenuous relationship to the artificial humanoids and simulated landscapes that imply the potential of a world stripped of coherent ‘natural’ forms.</p>
<p>In the <em>Skibidi</em> universe, the lines between humanity and technology are blurred, and the monstrous digital always has a hint of human quality. This theme is exemplified by the faction known as The Alliance which consists of mechanical humanoids with cameras, TVs, and speakers for heads. In the lore, many fans agree that The Alliance (Cameraheads) are not fully human but artificially produced human constructs made by people to fight the Toilets (ostensibly) <em>on behalf</em> of humans (<em>Skibidi Toilet Wiki</em>). In this reading, they are mutant offspring of the human world, in that humans have borne these hybrid creatures in the ‘image of the human’. They function as spectral abominations, perhaps future echoes of ‘us’ that reflect our human body types and our way of thinking about war and media, which, when taken to the extreme, descends into Baudrillardian nightmare in which the violence of war has no objective “but to prove its very existence” (Baudrillard 32). This is to say that the Cameraheads are not recording a war ‘that happens’ but producing a war <em>so that it can be recorded</em>, in order to prove that war exists in the way that serves the human agenda.</p>
<p>The anxieties about becoming—or producing—a warped chimeric aberration of our own media technology is emphasised when we consider that The Alliance is donned with <em>specific</em> technologies of surveillance and archive—namely CCTV. The digital becomes monstrous in the sense of their uncanny capacity to record and store everything we do with them, and people in turn record and document their entire lives in media—while we are simultaneously fretting about the impact of widespread surveillance and the loss of privacy involved (Deuze <em>Life in Media</em>). The discomfort is that The Alliance is not a separate artefact from the human world but its <em>evolution</em>. Perhaps we have poured so much of ourselves into the digital archiving and surveilling of ourselves—and that so much of the digital permeates our lives—that the next evolutionary step is a merging with those very technologies of surveillance and archive, or at the very least not knowing what would constitute meaningful boundaries between the two any longer. Perhaps we have already passed that point of no return, and all that is left to us is coming to terms with the monstrous digital, that is us. The Cameraheads represent a potential that humans have become <em>so</em> merged with their media technology—especially surveillance technology—that they have evolved <em>into</em> that technology and are not only living through it but become it, embody it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This anxiety resonates with the paradigm of the contemporary ‘media life’ put forth by Mark Deuze, in that “a media life can be seen as living in the ultimate archive, a public library of (almost) everything, embodying a personalized experience of all the information of the universe. At the same time, in media life the archive is alive, in that it is subject to constant intervention by yourself and others” (Deuze <em>Media Life</em> xv). When read in relation to Deuze’s theoretical intervention, the <em>Skibidi</em> universe is a way of displacing the anxiety about our ‘life in media’ onto the figure of the Camerahead. Reading <em>ourselves</em> as uncanny machines of the eternal digital archive is difficult to confront, and so engaging with that possibility is undertaken through the work of the Camerahead as a monstrous digital avatar. This logic follows Piatti-Farnell and Peaty’s reminder that monsters are in fact metaphors, in that “they function both as warnings and as reminders of that which we fear … . Monsters are creatures of difference, but they are never far removed from our human worlds”. The monstrosity here is not that the figures of <em>Skibidi</em> are semi-artificial, but that <em>we</em> might be—or have the potential to become, or perhaps that we are already there—and it is exactly that ambivalence that generates uncanniness and brings forth the monster in us all. The robotic world is born from <em>our organic one </em>and thus these two worlds are always closer than we think.</p>
<p><em>Skibidi</em>’s playfulness with ‘humanoid surveillance robots’ also brings forth Deuze’s remarks about the monstrous digital, in that “the ongoing fusion of information and organisms, of man and machine, and of media and life amplifies and accelerates a distinct notion of uncanniness in our daily perception of the world around us" (Deuze <em>Media Life</em> 26).&nbsp; Theoretical interrogations of the uncanny can be traced back to figures such as Heidegger and Freud—who remind us of how uncanniness is at the heart of the human experience. For the sake of brevity, we use Nicholas Royle’s broad definition to read the uncanny as a “crisis of the proper”, in which the uncanny points to and reflects perturbations of the natural order, things which “commingle the familiar and unfamiliar” (1). The Camerahead—as a figure of contemporary surveillance culture—pushes the naturalisation of everyday media technologies to the extreme until it becomes strange and uncanny. When read in this way, <em>Skibidi Toilet</em> is not devoid of substance and meaning, but embroiled in the cutting edge of conversations about how humanity may see itself as a mimicry of these creatures—at once human but with the potential to mutate into a spectre of our own media technology.</p>
<p>Having media technologies in place of the human head (especially in the case of the CCTV Cameraheads) also connotes <em>self</em>-surveillance as well as sousveillance (as we massively monitor each other). When coupled with the grey, concrete, office-block landscape of the <em>Skibidi</em> universe, the world reflects a dread about the political, economic, and social dimensions of the global surveillance apparatus and the associated impending corporate annihilation of the ‘natural’ world. Surveillance capitalism is the weapon of the corporate state, and its hegemony is directly coupled with the annihilation of ecological systems in so many ways, one of which is “in the form of massive energy costs for data centres, e-waste, and the mining of rare minerals” (Silverman 147). What little green is left is, first and foremost, man-made, and secondly primarily serving as the décor of the constructed <em>mise-en-scène</em> of the "human zoo", as Peter Sloterdijk describes our "anthropotechnological" context where we merge with technologies in a feeble attempt to control our human future. The degradation of natural habitats, the devastation of climate systems, and the loss of privacy grow bigger and more inevitable at what feels like a monstrous pace. Yet there is an ambivalence rooted in this global condition, in that one of the technocratic state’s greatest weapons against real and existential ‘threats’ is surveillance technology. Surveillance technology is used to counter terrorism and is also used in diverse, if sometimes problematic, ways to mitigate and control the spread of coronavirus (Glitsos). This ambivalence, or double-bind, is captured in the <em>Skibidi</em> narrative in that The Alliance is both the saviour of the humans in the <em>Skibidi</em> world—but also humanity’s greatest threat with its constant violence and single-minded destruction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly, the need for ecological balance and a sense of privacy is something robots do <em>not</em> understand, and the line here between the human and the artificial is pronounced by the chaos, confusion, and destruction that characterises the <em>Skibidi</em> universe, especially considering that it is often unclear which faction is more problematic and dangerous to the ‘human world.’ For example, one fan theorist claims:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I personally think the camera people are the bad guys. They resemble a corrupt government that tries to control everything. The toilets are citizens trying to knock down the corrupt government with the limited resources they have.</p>
<p>But if someone says the camera people are fighting an evil foreign power to save their city and people, that’s also logical.</p>
<p>You can interpret it in both ways. I think the society you're currently living in determines how you interpret it. (durjoy313)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The polysemy of the <em>Skibidi</em> text can take on many shapes and forms, and it may be exactly the randomness of the different sides and actors that allows for its popularity. It is not just good versus evil or beyond good and evil—the <em>Skibidi Toilet</em> story world is universally monstrous, which is not necessarily good or evil. The recurring theme in <em>Skibidi</em> is the sense of nihilism and cycles of inconsequential destruction (reflected in the unending gibberish of the <em>Skibidi</em> song itself). In the words of Lawrence May, popular media do such important work in “echoing the fears and anxieties of their social, political and cultural context” and that “the very environments we live within now evoke existential terror, and this state of ecological monstrosity has permeated popular media, including video games”. May is articulating the way that video games and new media can explore surprisingly complex and urgent political tensions, which we witness in the way that <em>Skibidi</em> (and its audiences) plays with notions of political economy and corruption.</p>
<p>The corporate domination of the natural world is manifest in the dystopian vision of the <em>Skibidi</em> architecture where “both the modernist city of skyscrapers and the sprawling suburban city carry the seeds of failure” (Ameel 14). The <em>Skibidi</em> landscape is notably devoid of plant and animal life but saturated in concrete and skyscrapers—the rooftops of which form an important point of action for many of the scenes and play a key role in manifesting the horror of a vanishing natural world. In <em>Skibidi</em> fandom, it is noted that the early episodes are “filled with many buildings/skyscrapers, two of which are extremely large and resemble the old Twin Towers in New York City from real life that collapsed in 2001” (<em>Skibidi Toilet Wiki</em>). This is a powerful totem in Gen Alpha sensibility, especially considering that Gen Alpha never knew a world with Twin Towers still standing. Instead, Gen Alpha is haunted by their absent presence, as the reverberations of the global ‘War on Terror’ are felt to this day. Young people exist in the wake of the fallen towers through the grim spectre of post-9/11 politics. This is key to <em>Skibidi</em> as a moment in the zeitgeist. Lieven Ameel reminds us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the idea of secular buildings rising to the skies as spatial embodiments of linear progress had long been suspect. Since Biblical and Mesopotamian accounts of the tower of Babel, the building of iconic high-rise buildings had led to accusations of pride and presumptions that would not go unpunished. The downfall of the WTC towers on the 11th of September, 2001, is only the most spectacular of recent examples that have been read in such vein. (Ameel 14)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is not incidental that the <em>Skibidi</em> war takes place in what becomes a ruined version of our ‘man[sic]-made accomplishments’ that humanity pursued at the cost of a fragile planet. Lawrence May reflects on a similar point in his consideration of games such as <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>about which he writes that these worlds are a vital way that individuals explore the simmering “horror of an aberrant and abjected near future” and he argues that “games can critically position players in relation to discourse and wider public debate about ecological issues and climate change” (May).</p>
<p>Finally, what do hostile, sentient, human-headed toilets have to do with … anything? Again, Gen Alpha is unique among other generations in that it is the first to be born in the twenty-first century, but it is also the first to be born into a world where the horror of the global pandemic shaped their consciousness at such critical developmental junctures and characterised their nascent experiences of the social fabric. There is so much to expand on here, not least of all the fact that during the pandemic, Gen Alpha’s entire learning and socialisation experience shifted to the mediated space in incongruent, sometimes isolating, and discombobulating ways. However, for the sake of brevity, we focus on the symbolic function of the toilet by way of Jon Stratton’s reading of toilet-related themes (in particular, panic-buying toilet paper) during the peak of the coronavirus pandemic (Stratton). In his work, Stratton unpicks the ways in which “pedestal toilets and toilet paper are key aspects of civilisation and the fear of the loss of toilet paper is connected to anxiety about social breakdown, the loss of civilisation” (145). Although ‘modern civilisation’ is often cast through the symbolism of objects like the steam train or the clock, it is really the flushing pedestal toilet—such as those featured in <em>Skibidi</em>—that encapsulates the way the West ‘sees itself’ as rising above primitivism through hygiene and cleanliness. Yet in <em>Skibidi</em>, the monstrous human head is <em>literally in the toilet</em>—and often getting flushed right down into the depths of its own foul pipes. One may ask if this is the way Gen Alpha sees humanity? This question is especially pertinent in that for all our fancy conceptualisations of the posthuman and the man-machine hybrid, what ‘remediates’ all of us truly back to the ostensibly organic is the simple fact that we all defecate. Once that space is colonised by robots and artificiality, there is truly nothing left but surrender to the monstrous digital.</p>
<p>In all its bizarre, monstrous glory, <em>Skibidi Toilet</em> can be read as Gen Alpha’s creative expression of the ‘trouble’ brought about by emergent artificial life forms and our (potential) dystopian futures—and with our essay, we argue that it is fruitful to stay with that trouble, as Donna Haraway so powerfully reminds us to do. <em>Skibidi</em> is made in and through the very media platforms that provoke the inherent tension in the idea of the monstrous digital. If, as Jeffrey Cohen suggests, the monster is born “as an embodiment of a certain cultural moment, of a time, a feeling, and a place” (Cohen 4), then camera-headed humanoids and their foes—toilet people—speak volumes about the anxieties and both fun and fearful frames of reference plaguing Gen Alpha.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main">
        <p>Elixir v1.19 brings further improvements to the type system and compilation times, allowing us to find more bugs, faster.</p>

<h2 id="type-system-improvements">Type system improvements</h2>

<p>This release improves the type system around two key areas: type inference and type checking of anonymous functions and protocols. These enhancements seem simple on the surface but required us to go beyond existing literature by extending current theory and developing new techniques. We will outline the technical details in future articles. For now, let’s look at what’s new.</p>

<h3 id="type-inference-of-all-constructs">Type inference of all constructs</h3>

<p>Type inference (or reconstruction) is the ability of a type system to automatically deduce, either partially or fully, the type of an expression at compile time. Type inference may occur at different levels. For example, many programming languages can automatically infer the types of variables, also known “local type inference”, but not all can infer type signatures of functions.</p>

<p>Originally, our plan with Elixir’s upcoming type system was to support type inference of patterns, guards, and return types. Therefore, if you wrote this simple function:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>even?</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>when</span> <span>is_integer</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>rem</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Elixir would correctly infer the type to be <code>integer() -&gt; boolean()</code>. However, if you wrote this function:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>even?</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>rem</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The type would be <code>dynamic() -&gt; boolean()</code>, since there are no guards, even though the functions behave virtually the same, as the <code>rem</code> operator expects both arguments to be integer (they just raise different exceptions for non-integer values).</p>

<p>Inferring type signatures comes with a series of trade-offs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Speed - type inference algorithms are often more computationally intensive than type checking algorithms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Expressiveness - in any given type system, the constructs that support inference are always a subset of those that can be type-checked. Therefore, if a programming language is restricted to only fully reconstructed types, it is less expressive than a solely type checked counterpart.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incremental compilation - type inference complicates incremental compilation. If module A depends on module B, which depends on module C, a change to C may require the type signature in B to be reconstructed, which may then require A to be recomputed (and so on). This dependency chain may require large projects to explicitly add type signatures for stability and compilation efficiency.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cascading errors - when a user accidentally makes type errors or the code has conflicting assumptions, type inference may lead to less clear error messages as the type system tries to reconcile diverging type assumptions across code paths.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, type inference offers the benefit of enabling type checking for functions and codebases without requiring the user to add type annotations. To balance these trade-offs, we are exploring “module type inference”: our goal is to infer type signatures considering invocations of functions in the same module and of functions from <em>other applications</em> (such as Elixir itself and your dependencies). Once module types are inferred, your whole project is type checked considering all declared and inferred types.</p>

<p>We have successfully implemented these features as part of Elixir v1.19, by performing inference of all constructs (except guards), taking into account the signatures from calls to functions within the same module and in Elixir’s standard library. This means the second function above, without the guard, will also infer the type <code>integer() -&gt; boolean()</code>.</p>

<p>In future releases, we plan to perform type inference of guards (originally planned for v1.19) and also consider the type signatures of your dependencies during inference. Overall, these changes allow us to assess the impact of the trade-offs above as the type system evolves, which suits well our current goals of incrementally using types to find bugs in existing codebases, without changing them.</p>

<p>Keep in mind this only applies to <em>type inference</em>. Once we introduce type signatures and you explicitly annotate your functions, type inference and the trade-offs above no longer play a role. Any function with an explicit type signature will be typed checked against the user-provided annotations, as in other statically typed languages.</p>

<h3 id="type-checking-of-protocol-dispatch-and-implementations">Type checking of protocol dispatch and implementations</h3>

<p>This release adds type checking when dispatching and implementing protocols.</p>

<p>For example, string interpolation in Elixir uses the <code>String.Chars</code> protocol. If you pass a value that does not implement said protocol, Elixir will now emit a warning accordingly.</p>

<p>Here is an example passing a range, which cannot be converted into a string, to an interpolation:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>Example</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>my_code</span><span>(</span><span>first</span><span>..</span><span>last</span><span>//</span><span>step</span> <span>=</span> <span>range</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>"hello </span><span>#{</span><span>range</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>the above emits the following warnings:</p>

<div><pre><code>warning: incompatible value given to string interpolation:

    data

it has type:

    %Range{first: term(), last: term(), step: term()}

but expected a type that implements the String.Chars protocol, it must be one of:

    dynamic(
      %Date{} or %DateTime{} or %NaiveDateTime{} or %Time{} or %URI{} or %Version{} or
        %Version.Requirement{}
    ) or atom() or binary() or float() or integer() or list(term())
</code></pre></div>

<p>Warnings are also emitted if you pass a data type that does not implement the <code>Enumerable</code> protocol as a generator to for-comprehensions:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>Example</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>my_code</span><span>(%</span><span>Date</span><span>{}</span> <span>=</span> <span>date</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>for</span><span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>&lt;-</span> <span>date</span><span>,</span> <span>do</span><span>:</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>will emit:</p>

<div><pre><code>warning: incompatible value given to for-comprehension:

    x &lt;- date

it has type:

    %Date{year: term(), month: term(), day: term(), calendar: term()}

but expected a type that implements the Enumerable protocol, it must be one of:

    dynamic(
      %Date.Range{} or %File.Stream{} or %GenEvent.Stream{} or %HashDict{} or %HashSet{} or
        %IO.Stream{} or %MapSet{} or %Range{} or %Stream{}
    ) or fun() or list(term()) or non_struct_map()
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="type-checking-and-inference-of-anonymous-functions">Type checking and inference of anonymous functions</h3>

<p>Elixir v1.19 can now type infer and type check anonymous functions. Here is a trivial example:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>Example</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>run</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>fun</span> <span>=</span> <span>fn</span> <span>%{}</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>:map</span> <span>end</span>
    <span>fun</span><span>.</span><span>(</span><span>"hello"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The example above has an obvious typing violation, as the anonymous function expects a map but a string is given. With Elixir v1.19, the following warning is now printed:</p>

<div><pre><code>    warning: incompatible types given on function application:

        fun.("hello")

    given types:

        binary()

    but function has type:

        (dynamic(map()) -&gt; :map)

    typing violation found at:
    │
  6 │     fun.("hello")
    │        ~
    │
    └─ mod.exs:6:8: Example.run/0
</code></pre></div>

<p>Function captures, such as <code>&amp;String.to_integer/1</code>, will also propagate the type as of Elixir v1.19, arising more opportunity for Elixir’s type system to catch bugs in our programs.</p>

<h2 id="faster-compile-times-in-large-projects">Faster compile times in large projects</h2>

<p>This release includes two compiler improvements that can lead up to 4x faster builds in large codebases.</p>

<p>While Elixir has always compiled the given files in project or a dependency in parallel, the compiler would sometimes be unable to use all of the machine resources efficiently. This release addresses two common limitations, delivering performance improvements that scale with codebase size and available CPU cores.</p>

<h3 id="code-loading-bottlenecks">Code loading bottlenecks</h3>

<p>Prior to this release, Elixir would load modules as soon as they were defined. However, because the Erlang part of code loading happens within a single process (the code server), this would make it a bottleneck, reducing parallelization, especially on large projects.</p>

<p>This release makes it so modules are loaded lazily. This reduces the pressure on the code server and the amount of work during compilation, with reports of more than two times faster compilation for large projects. The benefits depend on the codebase size and the number of CPU cores available.</p>

<p>Implementation wise, <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2012/04/24/a-peek-inside-elixir-s-parallel-compiler/">the parallel compiler already acts as a mechanism to resolve modules during compilation</a>, so we built on that. By making sure the compiler controls both module compilation and module loading, it can also better guarantee deterministic builds.</p>

<p>There are two potential regressions with this approach. The first one happens if you spawn processes during compilation which invoke other modules defined within the same project. For example:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>MyLib</span><span>.</span><span>SomeModule</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>list</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>...</span><span>]</span>

  <span>Task</span><span>.</span><span>async_stream</span><span>(</span><span>list</span><span>,</span> <span>fn</span> <span>item</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
    <span>MyLib</span><span>.</span><span>SomeOtherModule</span><span>.</span><span>do_something</span><span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Because the spawned process is not visible to the compiler, it won’t be able to load <code>MyLib.SomeOtherModule</code>. You have two options, either use <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Kernel.ParallelCompiler.html#pmap/2"><code>Kernel.ParallelCompiler.pmap/2</code></a> or explicitly call <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Code.html#ensure_compiled!/1"><code>Code.ensure_compiled!(MyLib.SomeOtherModule)</code></a> before spawning the process that uses said module.</p>

<p>The second one is related to <code>@on_load</code> callbacks (typically used for <a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/system/nif.html">NIFs</a>) that invoke other modules defined within the same project. For example:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>MyLib</span><span>.</span><span>SomeModule</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>@on_load</span> <span>:init</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>init</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>MyLib</span><span>.</span><span>AnotherModule</span><span>.</span><span>do_something</span><span>()</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>something_else</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>...</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>MyLib</span><span>.</span><span>SomeModule</span><span>.</span><span>something_else</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The reason this fails is because <code>@on_load</code> callbacks are invoked within the code server and therefore they have limited ability to load additional modules. It is generally advisable to limit invocation of external modules during <code>@on_load</code> callbacks but, in case it is strictly necessary, you can set <code>@compile {:autoload, true}</code> in the invoked module to address this issue in a forward and backwards compatible manner.</p>

<p>Both snippets above could actually lead to non-deterministic compilation failures in the past, and as a result of these changes, compiling these cases are now deterministic.</p>

<h3 id="parallel-compilation-of-dependencies">Parallel compilation of dependencies</h3>

<p>This release introduces a variable called <code>MIX_OS_DEPS_COMPILE_PARTITION_COUNT</code>, which instructs <code>mix deps.compile</code> to compile dependencies in parallel.</p>

<p>While fetching dependencies and compiling individual Elixir dependencies already happened in parallel, as outlined in the previous section, there were pathological cases where performance gains would be left on the table, such as when compiling dependencies with native code or dependencies where one or two large files would take most of the compilation time.</p>

<p>By setting <code>MIX_OS_DEPS_COMPILE_PARTITION_COUNT</code> to a number greater than 1, Mix will now compile multiple dependencies at the same time, using separate OS processes. Empirical testing shows that setting it to half of the number of cores on your machine is enough to maximize resource usage. The exact speed up will depend on the number of dependencies and the number of machine cores and some users reported up to 4x faster compilation times when using our release candidates. If you plan to enable it on CI or build servers, keep in mind it will most likely have a direct impact on memory usage too.</p>

<h2 id="erlangotp-28-support">Erlang/OTP 28 support</h2>

<p>Elixir v1.19 officially supports Erlang/OTP 28.1+ and later. In order to support the new Erlang/OTP 28 representation for regular expressions, structs can now control how they are escaped into abstract syntax trees by defining a <code>__escape__/1</code> callback.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the new representation for regular expressions in Erlang/OTP 28+ implies they can no longer be used as default values for struct fields. Therefore, this is not allowed:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>defstruct</span> <span>regex:</span> <span>~r/foo/</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can, however, still use regexes when initializing the structs themselves:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>defmodule</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>defstruct</span> <span>[</span><span>:regex</span><span>]</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>new</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>%</span><span>Foo</span><span>{</span><span>regex:</span> <span>~r/foo/</span><span>}</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="openchain-certification">OpenChain certification</h2>

<p>Elixir v1.19 is also our first release following OpenChain compliance, <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2025/02/26/elixir-openchain-certification/">as previously announced</a>. In a nutshell:</p>

<ul>

                                        <p>NEW YORK (AP) — Dozens of reporters turned in access badges and exited the Pentagon on Wednesday rather than agree to government-imposed <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/pentagon-journalists-new-restrictions-hegseth-b9e70801f7d7930251a0740e7168f775">restrictions on their work</a></span>, pushing journalists who cover the American military further from the seat of its power. The nation’s leadership called the new rules “common sense” to help regulate a “very disruptive” press. </p><p>News outlets were nearly unanimous in rejecting new rules imposed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that would leave journalists vulnerable to expulsion if they sought to report on information — classified or otherwise — that had not been approved by Hegseth for release.</p>
    
<p>Many of the reporters waited to leave together at a 4 p.m. deadline set by the Defense Department to get out of the building. As the hour approached, boxes of documents lined a Pentagon corridor and reporters carried chairs, a copying machine, books and old photos to the parking lot from suddenly abandoned workspaces. Shortly after 4, about 40 to 50 journalists left together after handing in badges.</p><div data-align-center="">

He’s held only two formal press briefings, banned reporters from accessing many parts of the sprawling Pentagon without an escort and launched investigations into leaks to the media.</p><p>He has called his new rules “common sense” and said the requirement that journalists sign a document outlining the rules means they acknowledge the new rules, not necessarily agree to them. Journalists see that as a distinction without a difference.</p>

<p>
The
<a href="https://rust-for-linux.com/">
Rust for Linux</a> project has been good for Rust, Tyler Mandry, one of the
co-leads of Rust's language-design team, said. He
gave a talk at
<a href="https://kangrejos.com/">
Kangrejos&nbsp;2025</a> covering upcoming Rust language features and thanking
the Rust for Linux developers for helping drive them forward. Afterward, Benno Lossin and Xiangfei Ding
went into more detail about their work on the three most important language
features for kernel development: field projections, in-place initialization, and arbitrary self types.
</p>

<p>
Many people have remarked that the development of new language features in Rust
can be quite slow, Mandry said. Partly, that can be attributed to the care the
Rust language team takes to avoid enshrining bad designs. But the biggest reason
is "<q>alignment in attention</q>". The Rust project is driven by volunteers,
which means that if there are not people focusing on pushing a given feature or
group of related features forward, they languish. The Rust for Linux project has
actually been really helpful for addressing that, Mandry explained, because it
is something that a lot of people are excited about, and that focuses effort
onto the few specific things that the Linux kernel needs.
</p>

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1040419">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2025/tyler-mandry-kangrejos-small.png" alt="[Tyler Mandry]" title="Tyler Mandry">
</a></p><p>
Mandry then went through a whirlwind list of upcoming language features,
including
<a href="https://github.com/Skepfyr/rfcs/blob/extern-types-v2/text/3396-extern-types-v2.md">
types without known size information</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/joshtriplett/rfcs/blob/use/text/3680-use.md">
reference-counting improvements</a>,
<a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-pre-rfc-generic-effect-system-for-functions/22550?utm_source=chatgpt.com">
user-defined function modifiers of the same kind as <tt>const</tt></a>, and more.
At the end, he asked which of those were most
important to Rust for Linux, and how the assembled kernel developers would
prioritize them. Beyond the three features to be discussed later,
Lossin said that the project definitely wanted the ability to
write functions that can be evaluated at compile time (called
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/keyword.const.html#compile-time-evaluable-functions">
<tt>const</tt>
functions</a> in Rust) in trait definitions.
Danilo Krummrich asked for
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/31844">
specialization</a>, which immediately
prompted an "<q>Oh no!</q>" from Lossin, due to the feature's nearly decade-long
history of causing problems for Rust's type system. Specialization would allow
two overlapping implementations for a single trait to exist, with the compiler
picking the more specific one. Matthew Maurer asked for some ability to control
what the compiler does on integer overflow.
</p>

<p>
Ultimately, Miguel Ojeda told Mandry that the priority should be on stabilizing the
unstable language features that Rust for Linux currently uses, followed by
language features that would change how the project structures its code, followed by
everything else. The next two talks went into much more detail about the current
status and future plans for some of those key language features.
</p>

<!-- middle-ad -->

<h4>Field projections</h4>

<p>
Field
projection refers to the idea of taking a pointer to a structure, and turning it
into a pointer to a field of the structure. Rust does already have this for the
built-in reference and pointer types, but it can't always be made to work for
user-defined smart-pointer types. Since the Rust for Linux developers would like
to have custom smart pointers to handle
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1034603/">
untrusted data</a>, reference counting,
external locking, and related kernel complications, they would benefit from a
general language feature allowing field projections for all pointer types using
the same syntax.
Lossin spoke about his work on the problem, which has been ongoing
since Kangrejos&nbsp;2022. There has been "<q>lots of progress</q>" so far, but the
work is still in the design stage, with a few details left to work out.
</p>

<p>
The built-in field projections all have the same kind of type signature, Lossin
explained. For example, the code for
converting a reference to an object into a reference to one of its
fields and the code for
converting a raw pointer to an object into a raw pointer to one of its fields
look different, but have similar signatures:
</p>

<pre>    fn project_reference(r: &amp;MyStruct) -&gt; &amp;Field {
        &amp;r.field
    }

    unsafe fn project_pointer(r: *mut MyStruct) -&gt; *mut Field {
        unsafe { &amp;raw mut (*r).field }
    }

    // The equivalent C code would look like this:
    struct field *project(struct my *r) {
        return &amp;(r-&gt;field);
    }
</pre>

<p>
This example uses the relatively recent
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2582-raw-reference-mir-operator.md">
raw borrow</a> syntax.
</p>

<p>
The
<a href="https://rust.docs.kernel.org/core/pin/struct.Pin.html">
<tt>Pin</tt></a> type throws a bit of a wrench into things.
The Rust
compiler is, by default, free to move structures around for performance reasons.
That doesn't work when the structure is being referenced from the C side, so the
<tt>Pin</tt> type is used to mark structures that shouldn't be moved.
Projecting a
<s><tt>Pin&lt;MyStruct&gt;</tt></s> <tt>Pin&lt;&amp;mut MyStruct&gt;</tt>
[Lossin sent LWN a correction: <tt>Pin</tt> is always used to wrap a pointer
type, not a structure directly]
might produce either a <tt>Pin&lt;&amp;mut Field&gt;</tt> or a
plain <tt>&amp;mut Field</tt> depending on whether the field is also of a type that
shouldn't be moved or not. So the most general possible signature for the field projection operation
would be something like this, Lossin said:
</p>

<pre>    Container&lt;'a, Struct&gt; -&gt; Output&lt;'a, Field&gt;
</pre>

<p>
That is, given some pointer type that wraps a structure and must be valid for
lifetime <tt>a</tt>, projecting a field gives a (possibly different) output
pointer type wrapping a field of that structure, valid for the same lifetime.
Lossin then gave an example of how supporting this could make fully implementing
read-copy-update (RCU)
support in the kernel's Rust bindings a lot easier.
</p>

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1040419#benno">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2025/benno-lossin-kangrejos-small.png" alt="[Benno Lossin]" title="Benno Lossin">
</a></p><p>
The RCU mechanism protects readers from concurrent writers, he explained, but it
doesn't protect writers from each other. It's somewhat common in the kernel, therefore,
to have a mutex protecting some data, with a frequently accessed
field of that data being protected by RCU. That way, readers rely on the RCU
lock (which is cheap), and writers synchronize with each other using the mutex.
Translating that interface to Rust poses problems: Rust doesn't allow any access
to the content inside a
<a href="https://rust.docs.kernel.org/kernel/sync/lock/mutex/type.Mutex.html">
<tt>Mutex</tt></a> without locking it first, so the
straightforward translation of this pattern wouldn't work. It would force Rust
readers to lock the mutex in order to read the RCU field, which would be an
unacceptable performance hit.
</p>

<p>
With generalized field projection in the language, though, the Rust for Linux
developers could write bindings that permit projecting a
<tt>&amp;Mutex&lt;MyStruct&gt;</tt> into an <tt>&amp;Rcu&lt;Field&gt;</tt> without holding
the lock. In driver code, attempting to read from the RCU-protected field
would look like a normal access, the same way it is in C — but the compiler
would still check that the other, non-RCU-protected data isn't touched without
holding the mutex.
</p>

<p>
Lossin ended by asking the assembled developers to keep an eye on
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/146307">the tracking issue</a>
for the feature, and provide feedback on it. Daniel Almeida asked whether
testing the feature outside the mainline kernel was really helpful; Ojeda
affirmed that it was, because that makes it easier to go to the Rust team and
make a case to stabilize the feature. The Rust for Linux project is trying not
to use any new unstable features (and to compile with a version of Rust equal to
or older than the version
packaged on Debian stable), so the feature needs to be completed and make it
into Debian&nbsp;14 (expected in 2027) before it will be widely usable in kernel code.
</p>

<p>
Andreas Hindborg asked: "<q>Can we have this yesterday, please?</q>", to general
amusement. The kernel's Rust bindings already feature a plethora of custom
pointers encoding various invariants; this feature, whenever it becomes
available to kernel code, may make them a good deal easier to use in driver code.
</p>

<h4>Arbitrary self types</h4>

<p>
Ding gave an update immediately afterward about another ergonomic language
feature for custom pointers: arbitrary self types. In Rust, a method on a type
can have a first argument that is an object of the type or that is a reference
to one.
Such a method can be called with the <tt>.method()</tt> syntax, instead of the
more general <tt>Type::function()</tt> syntax. But the proliferation of smart
pointers in kernel Rust code means that the programmer frequently does not have
a plain reference; often, they instead have a
<tt>Pin</tt>, an
<a href="https://rust.docs.kernel.org/kernel/sync/struct.Arc.html">
<tt>Arc</tt></a>,
or some other smart-pointer type.
</p>

<p>
The arbitrary self types proposal that Ding has been working on would let
programmers write methods that take smart pointers, instead of normal references:
</p>

<pre>    impl MyStruct {
        fn method(self: Pin&lt;&amp;mut MyStruct&gt;) {}
    }
</pre>

<p>
Unfortunately, adding this to the compiler has not proved to be straightforward.
The interaction with  Rust's existing
<a href="https://rust.docs.kernel.org/core/ops/trait.Deref.html">
<tt>Deref</tt> trait</a>, which makes custom smart pointers possible in the first
place, complicates the implementation because not all of the type information is
available while searching for matching methods. Currently, if the user has a
<tt>Pin&lt;&amp;mut MyStruct&gt;</tt> and they call a method on it, the compiler
will first look for a matching method for <tt>Pin</tt>. If one isn't found, it
will try to dereference the type, producing a <tt>&amp;mut MyStruct</tt>. That
type is checked for matching methods, and then
is dereferenced one final time, producing a <tt>MyStruct</tt>. That type will
finally have a matching method, or else the compiler will emit a type error.
</p>

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1040419#xiangfei">
<img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2025/xiangfei-ding-kangrejos-small.png" alt="[Xiangfei Ding]" title="Xiangfei Ding">
</a></p><p>
By the time that procedure begins checking functions associated with
<tt>MyStruct</tt>, it will have already discarded information about the wrapping
types, which an implementation of arbitrary self types needs.
Ding spent a few minutes explaining the approaches for
rectifying the problem that he had tried and discarded, before focusing on the
current approach. He has added another trait — tentatively called
<tt>Receiver</tt> — that is used to mark types that can be used with arbitrary
self types. Then the compiler can try following the chain of <tt>Receiver</tt>
implementations before following the chain of <tt>Deref</tt> implementations.
That does mean that a pointer type will have to opt into being used as an arbitrary
self type, but Ding didn't see that as a downside. Letting the author of a
pointer type decide when it should support the new feature eliminates a lot of
concerns around accidentally introducing backward compatibility problems. For
the kernel, it doesn't really impose a barrier, because the Rust developers can
just add <tt>Receiver</tt> implementations as they run across cases that require
them.
</p>

<p>
Ojeda asked how long Ding thought it would take to finalize the arbitrary self
types feature; in particular, would it be ready within a year? Ding agreed that
a year was possible, although he would need support from the Rust language team
in order to make that happen. He wants to run
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/crater?tab=readme-ov-file#crater">
Crater</a>, the tool that the Rust
community uses to check whether compiler changes break any published Rust
libraries, against his change before submitting the code. Ojeda offered help with
obtaining a large build machine to do that, since Ding has had trouble previously
with the memory requirements to compile some packages during a Crater run.
</p>

<h4>In-place initialization</h4>

<p>
The other topic that Ding wanted to cover was his work on in-place
initialization. Like the other new language features being discussed, this
doesn't really enable new use cases, but it does make common kernel code
cleaner. Currently, Rust code in the kernel uses the
<a href="https://rust.docs.kernel.org/kernel/prelude/macro.pin_init.html">
<tt>pin_init!()</tt> macro</a>
to create structures that are fixed in place after initialization (by being
wrapped in <tt>Pin</tt>).
</p>

<p>
There's nothing wrong with <tt>pin_init!()</tt>: "<q>We love <tt>pin_init!()</tt>! We
want to make a language feature out of it.</q>" Adopting a language feature for
in-place initialization would also help with a handful of sharp edges outside
kernel code; it could make creating large
<a href="https://rust.docs.kernel.org/core/future/trait.Future.html">
<tt>Future</tt></a> values on the heap
more ergonomic, and let some traits become
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html#dyn-compatibility">
dyn-compatible</a>. The exact design of
this language feature was more up in the air; Ding covered three different
proposals for how it could work.
</p>

<p>
The simplest, proposed by Alice Ryhl and Lossin, would be to add a new
keyword, <tt>init</tt>, before a structure-initializing expression in order to ask
the compiler to automatically write an
implementation of the kernel's
<a href="https://rust.docs.kernel.org/kernel/prelude/trait.PinInit.html">
<tt>PinInit</tt> trait</a>. That has the nice
benefit of being a fairly minimal change to the language, although it would lock
in the use of the <tt>PinInit</tt> trait in its current form.
</p>

<p>
Another solution,
<a href="https://hackmd.io/@rust-lang-team/r1zNmpwwgl#In-place-initialization-via-outptrs">
proposed</a> by Taylor Cramer, would introduce a new type of
reference into the language. Rust's existing references can either be read from
(<tt>&amp;</tt>) or read from and written to (<tt>&amp;mut</tt>). This proposal
would add a third type, <tt>&amp;out</tt>, that can only be written to, not read
from. The only way to use an <tt>&amp;out</tt> reference would be to
either write to it, or use projection to break it apart into multiple
<tt>&amp;out</tt> references to various fields. Under this scheme, in-place
initialization would look like allocating space on the heap, and then returning
an <tt>&amp;out</tt> reference. The calling code could then fill it in however
it wants to, potentially passing off sub-parts to other functions. The compiler
would track that the <tt>&amp;out</tt> references
are all used before allowing the code to obtain a
normal <tt>&amp;mut</tt> reference to the heap allocation.
</p>

<p>
That proposal was considerably less polished than Ryhl and Lossin's approach,
however. Ding later told me that he, Mandry, and other compiler contributors at
Kangrejos were actually working on figuring out how it
would interact with some of the Rust compiler's internals in between talks that
day. By the end of the conference, they had a rough idea of how it could be
implemented, so a more detailed version of the out-pointer proposal may be
forthcoming shortly.
</p>

<p>
The final design, taking inspiration from C++, would be a form of guaranteed
optimization, where constructing a new value and then immediately moving it to
the heap causes it to be constructed on the heap in the first place. Ding was
less sure about the details of the final proposal; he suggested that the best
way forward might be to implement both the <tt>PinInit</tt> proposal and the
out-reference proposal, and see how well each approach works in practice.
</p>

<p>
Regardless of which approach ends up being chosen, it seems clear that Mandry's
point about the Rust for Linux project driving language improvement is
correct. While these features are in the early stages, adopting them could
significantly simplify code involving user-defined smart pointers, both within
and outside the kernel.
</p>

<p>
<b>Update:</b> Since the talks described in this article, the work on field
projection has received an update. Lossin wrote in to inform LWN that all fields
of all structures are now considered structurally pinned, so projecting a
<tt>Pin</tt> will now always produce a <tt>Pin&lt;&amp;mut Field&gt;</tt> or
similar value.

	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0"><em>ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for ProPublica’s <a href="https://go.propublica.org/big-story-2019">Big Story</a> newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox as soon as they are published.</em></p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">Last fall, Intuit’s longtime CEO Brad Smith embarked on a farewell tour of the company’s offices around the world. Smith had presided over 11 years of explosive growth, a period when Intuit had secured its place in the Silicon Valley pantheon, and the tour was like a long party.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">In Ontario, employees wore T-shirts with Smith’s quasi-spiritual sayings: “Do whatever makes your heart beat fastest” and “Repetition doesn’t ruin the prayer.” In Bangalore, India, workers put on Smith face masks as they posed for selfies with the man himself. Fittingly, the tour culminated in San Diego, the home of TurboTax, the software that transformed the company’s fortunes. There, Smith arrived at his party in a DeLorean, and as he walked a red carpet, cheering employees waved “Brad is Rad” signs. To Smith’s delight, his favorite rock star, Gene Simmons of Kiss, emerged. The two posed for pictures, Simmons clad in black and the beaming CEO flashing the “rock on” hand sign.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">Intuit began in the 1980s as an accounting software company focused on helping people with their bookkeeping. Over time, the company, like the other giants of Big Tech, cultivated an image of being not just good at what it did, but good, period. In a recent Super Bowl ad, Intuit portrayed itself as a gentle robot that liberates small-business owners from paperwork. The company stresses values above all, urging employees to “deliver awesome” and pursue “integrity without compromise.”</p>
                
    

               

   
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">Intuit’s QuickBooks accounting product remains a steady moneymaker, but in the past two decades TurboTax, its tax preparation product, has driven the company’s steadily growing profits and made it a Wall Street phenom. When Smith took over in 2008, TurboTax was a market leader, but only a small portion of Americans filed their taxes online. By 2019, nearly 40% of U.S. taxpayers filed online and some 40 million of them did so with TurboTax, far more than with any other product.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.0">But the success of TurboTax rests on a shaky foundation, one that could collapse overnight if the U.S. government did what most wealthy countries did long ago and made tax filing simple and free for most citizens.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0">For more than 20 years, Intuit has waged a sophisticated, sometimes covert war to prevent the government from doing just that, according to internal company and IRS documents and interviews with insiders. The company unleashed a battalion of lobbyists and hired top officials from the agency that regulates it. From the beginning, Intuit recognized that its success depended on two parallel missions: stoking innovation in Silicon Valley while stifling it in Washington. Indeed, employees ruefully joke that the company’s motto should actually be “compromise without integrity.”</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.0">Internal presentations lay out company tactics for fighting “encroachment,” Intuit’s catchall term for any government initiative to make filing taxes easier — such as creating a free government filing system or pre-filling people’s returns with payroll or other data the IRS already has. “For a decade proposals have sought to create IRS tax software or a ReturnFree Tax System; All were stopped,” reads a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6483065-Intuit-board-of-directors-presentation-2007.html">confidential 2007 PowerPoint</a> presentation from an Intuit board of directors meeting. The company’s 2014-15 plan included <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6483061-Intuit-TurboTax-2014-15-Encroachment-Strategy.html">manufacturing “3rd-party grass roots” support</a>. “Buy ads for op-eds/editorials/stories in African American and Latino media,” one internal PowerPoint slide states.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.0">The centerpiece of Intuit’s anti-encroachment strategy has been the Free File program, hatched 17 years ago in a moment of crisis for the company. Under the terms of an agreement with the federal government, Intuit and other commercial tax prep companies promised to provide free online filing to tens of millions of lower-income taxpayers. In exchange, the IRS pledged not to create a government-run system.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0">Since Free File’s launch, Intuit has done everything it could to limit the program’s reach while making sure the government stuck to its end of the deal. As ProPublica has <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-deliberately-hides-its-free-file-page-from-search-engines">reported</a>, Intuit added code to the Free File landing page of TurboTax that hid it from search engines like Google, making it harder for would-be users to find.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">Twelve years ago, Intuit launched its own “free” product: the similarly named “Free Edition” of TurboTax. But unlike the government program, this one comes with traps that can push customers lured with the promise of “free” into paying, some more than $200. Free Edition was a smash hit for Intuit and its pitch for “free” prep remains core to the company’s growth. Recently, it launched a “free, free free free” ad campaign for the Free Edition, including a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6476887-NYT-TurboTax-Free-Crossword.html">crossword</a> puzzle in The New York Times in which the answer to every clue was “f-r-e-e.”</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0">Intuit knows it’s deceiving its customers, internal company documents obtained by ProPublica show. “The website lists Free, Free, Free and the customers are assuming their return will be free,” said a company PowerPoint presentation that reported the results of an analysis of customer calls this year. “Customers are getting upset.”</p>

            </figure>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="16.0">Intuit also continues to use <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-just-tricked-you-into-paying-to-file-your-taxes">“dark patterns”</a> — design tricks to get users of its website to do things they don’t necessarily mean to do — to ensure that as many customers as possible pay, former employees say. A marketing concept frequently invoked at Intuit, which goes by the acronym “FUD,” seeks to tap into Americans’ fear, uncertainty and doubt about the tax filing process.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0">An Intuit spokesman declined to answer ProPublica’s detailed questions about its efforts to fend off a government filing system, but he provided a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6476893-Intuit-Statement-to-ProPublica.html">statement</a>.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="18.0">“We empower our customers to take control of their financial lives, which includes being in charge of their own tax preparation,” he said, adding that a “government-run pre-filled tax preparation system that makes the tax collector (who is also the investigator, auditor and enforcer) the tax preparer is fraught with conflicts of interest.”</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0">The IRS is seemingly the biggest threat to Intuit and other commercial tax prep businesses, but it has more frequently acted as the industry’s ally, defending the Free File program even in the face of critical internal reviews. The IRS declined to comment for this article.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0">The consequences of Intuit’s efforts affect a huge proportion of the taxpaying public. Americans spend an estimated 1.7 billion hours and $31 billion doing their taxes each year. Just 2.8 million participated in the Free File program this year, down from 5.1 million at the program’s peak in 2005.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0">Intuit’s success has made the men who run the company rich. Smith, the CEO who stepped down last year and is now executive board chair, had a stake worth $20 million when he became chief executive. It ballooned to $220 million by last year. Co-founder Scott Cook is now among the country’s wealthiest people, his fortune soaring to $3.3 billion.</p>

	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0">This year, Intuit was close to realizing a long-held goal: enshrining the Free File program in law, effectively closing the door on the IRS ever creating a free tax filing system. But an outcry followed ProPublica’s reporting on the matter and Intuit’s treatment of its customers, prompting the provision to be <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/congress-scraps-provision-to-restrict-irs-from-competing-with-turbotax">dropped</a> and state and <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/senior-irs-leaders-launch-review-of-partnership-with-turbotax-and-h-r-block">federal</a> <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-maker-intuit-h-r-block-new-york-regulator-launches-investigation">investigations</a> into Intuit’s practices.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="24.0">Yet even after this setback, the company remained steadfastly confident that its clout in Washington would win the day.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0">“What we’re not gonna do is fight this publicly because that is exactly what they want us to do,” said Sasan Goodarzi, the new CEO, in a video released to staff this May and obtained by ProPublica. “We are actually working with the IRS and members of the Congress to ensure that the facts are very clear.”</p>
            
	<hr>

            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.0">Intuit has dominated the tax software market since 1993, when for $225 million, it bought Chipsoft, the San Diego-based company that had created TurboTax. Even then, TurboTax was the most popular option, but Intuit pursued a plan of aggressive growth. The product necessarily came on a disk, and by the end of the 1990s TurboTax boxes were nearly ubiquitous, on shelves in office supply stores across America.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="28.0">As internet speeds increased and dot-com mania took hold, it became apparent that Intuit’s future was not in a box on a shelf. It was online.</p>
	
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="28.1">The prospect of TurboTax’s growth was vast for another reason. As late as 2001, around 45 million Americans still filled out their tax forms on paper. For Intuit, those were all potential customers.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0">But Intuit wasn’t alone in seeing possibilities in the spread of high-speed internet. In Washington, lawmakers began pushing the IRS to modernize and get more taxpayers to file electronically. It was a no-brainer: Filing taxes online would be easier, and the IRS would save staff costs on processing paper returns.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0">The danger to Intuit’s growing business was obvious. If the government succeeded in creating a system that allowed the vast majority of taxpayers to file online for free, TurboTax profits would plummet. Intuit recognized that the notion of “return-free filing” was not going away on its own.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0">And so in 1998, the company hired Bernie McKay, a onetime Carter administration aide and a senior lobbyist at AT&amp;T, to be its vice president for corporate affairs. Intuit executives like to talk about having a “customer obsession” in developing their products. McKay’s obsession is stopping government encroachment. Known to physically bang the table to drive home a point, McKay’s style is “aggressive to the point of offense,” said one fellow tax prep lobbyist. An Intuit spokesman said, “This mischaracterization of Mr. McKay is pure fiction.”</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.0">McKay, for his part, when asked at a recent tax industry conference which Star Wars character he is, responded, “Darth Vader.”</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.0">The year McKay was hired, Congress passed a major overhaul of the IRS. The bill, reflecting Intuit’s lobbying, said that the IRS “should cooperate with and encourage the private sector” to increase electronic filing.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="34.0">While McKay came through in his first big test, in 2002, the company found itself up against an unexpected foe, the George W. Bush administration. The threat came from a broad administration initiative to upgrade government technology. One of the proposals called for the IRS to develop “an easy, no-cost option for taxpayers to file their tax return online.”</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.0">Without such an option, taxpayers were stuck either filing on paper or, to file electronically, paying a tax professional or software company like TurboTax. Providing an alternative would be an obvious improvement, said Mark Forman, an official at the Office of Management and Budget who led the “e-government” program. The technology wasn’t all that complicated, and creating a free, automated filing system would help tens of millions of Americans. “This was seen as a low-cost, high-payoff initiative,” Forman recalled in a recent interview with ProPublica. Standing in the way, he said, was an industry “that lives off the complexity of the tax code.”</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="36.0">Intuit revved its new lobbying machine. Even before the OMB report was publicly released, a group of Republican lawmakers, led by TurboTax’s hometown congressman, wrote to the agency arguing that there was no reason for the government to “compete” with the “well-established” private tax prep companies. Intuit’s lobbyists also went above the OMB and pressed their case directly to the White House, Forman recalled.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.0">At the IRS, “all hell broke loose,” remembered Terry Lutes, who was then the head of electronic filing at the agency. Intuit’s clout on the Hill meant that lawmakers were soon accusing the IRS of making “secret plans to undercut the industry,” Lutes said. The agency ran the risk of seeing its funding cut if it were to pursue the Bush plan.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="38.0">The IRS commissioner at the time, Charles Rossotti, also opposed the idea. The IRS’ customer service staff, already too thin to respond adequately to Americans’ questions about the tax code, would have to grow substantially to handle millions of software queries. Congress “will never give you sufficient funding,” Rossotti told ProPublica.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="39.0">So the IRS felt caught in the middle. The question became, Lutes said, “Is there some way to come out of this with something for taxpayers that addresses the administration’s objective and at the same time is acceptable to industry?”</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="40.0">Intuit, it turned out, did have a way. Since 1999, as part of the company’s strategy to head off encroachment, TurboTax had been offering free tax prep to the poorest filers. It was a program that served to bolster the company’s arguments that government intervention was unnecessary.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="41.0">This became the basis for a deal. The industry would offer free tax prep to a larger portion of taxpayers. In exchange, the IRS would promise not to develop its own system.</p>

	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="43.0">Intuit organized a coalition of tax prep companies under the name the Free File Alliance, and after negotiations with the IRS, the group agreed to provide free federal filing to 60% of taxpayers, or about 78 million people at the time. Government officials touted the solution as a marvel of public and private cooperation. Americans would get free tax prep, and it would cost the government almost nothing.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="44.0">For Intuit, it was the culmination of years of lobbying. The IRS had signed a contract that said it “will not compete with the [Free File Alliance] in providing free, online tax return preparation and filing services to taxpayers.”</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="45.0">What’s more, “free” wasn’t as unprofitable as it sounded. The alliance, guided by a lawyer who was also an Intuit lobbyist, won a series of concessions that made the program palatable to industry. Free File only required the companies to offer free federal returns. They could charge for other products. The state return was the most common, but they could also pitch loans, “audit defense” or even products that had nothing to do with taxes.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="46.0">Free File had another bright side: The companies could tailor their Free File offers so that they didn’t cut into their base of paying customers. The agreement said the industry had to offer free federal services to at least 60% of taxpayers, but each company individually only had to cover 10% of taxpayers. Intuit and the others were free to limit their offers of free tax prep by age, income or state.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.0">There was little incentive for the companies to publicize a free alternative to their paid products, and the IRS agreed that the Free File offers need only be listed on a special page of the agency’s website.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="48.0">For Intuit, it was a major victory in the war against encroachment. The company could now focus on turning whatever new customers it acquired through the program into paying users, both that year and in the future.</p>
            
	<hr>

            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="50.0">The first year of Free File was 2003, and for Intuit, things went well. On paper, the Free File Alliance was a collection of 17 companies, all of them vying to serve the American taxpayer. But in reality, it was a group made up of two giants and a bunch of gnats. Intuit’s only significant competitor was H&amp;R Block, and even it was a distant second. The rest of the alliance consisted mostly of tiny companies with names like Free1040TaxReturns.com. As a result, Intuit could tailor its Free File offer just the way it wanted.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="51.0">But the next year, Intuit began to lose control of its creation. A scrappy competitor, TaxAct, decided to use Free File to stand out. The company decided it would try to pick up as many new customers as possible and then charge them for ancillary services. Instead of following Intuit’s lead and constraining its offer to a subset of low-income taxpayers, TaxAct went the opposite direction.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="52.0">“Why not go for an offer that’s much simpler to understand?” is how Lance Dunn, the president of the maker of TaxAct, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6480807-Lance-Dunn-Transcript-Day-2.html#document/p78">described</a> the strategy in a later court hearing. It began advertising a pitch for “free federal online tax preparation and e-filing for all taxpayers. No restrictions. Everyone qualifies.”</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="53.0">TurboTax’s offer on the Free File page, meanwhile, was more difficult to parse: “if you are eligible for EIC, are age 22 or younger, age 62 or older, or active Military with a W2.” (EIC stood for the Earned Income Tax Credit.)</p>
            
    
                        
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="55.0">TaxAct’s ploy was a smashing success. The company’s volume exploded.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="56.0">Alarmed, Intuit tried to get the other companies not to offer their products for free to too many potential customers, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6477791-Lance-Dunn-Transcript.html#document/p50">according</a> to Dunn. Such a request could be collusion, a violation of antitrust law, Dunn said. “Intuit asked the Free File Alliance members that we should restrict offers, which I believe is probably not legal for that group to restrain trade,” he said.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="57.0">ProPublica asked Intuit about Dunn’s accusation, but the company did not respond.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="58.0">Dunn, who declined to speak with ProPublica, made these remarks during sworn testimony in 2011. The hearing was part of an antitrust case by the Justice Department against H&amp;R Block after it tried to buy TaxAct. The U.S. argued that, by eliminating a competitor, the merger would create a duopoly of Intuit and H&amp;R Block. Although the Justice Department ultimately blocked that takeover, the market has grown even more consolidated in recent years. In 2019, according to a ProPublica analysis of IRS data, the two giants accounted for 81% of all individual returns filed using tax prep software.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="59.0">On the defensive, Intuit and H&amp;R Block matched TaxAct’s “no restrictions” offer on Free File. Americans rushed to file for free, and in 2005, 5 million people filed their taxes through the program. Free File had become the most popular way to file taxes online.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.0">Intuit viewed the popularity of Free File as a serious threat and took its case to Congress. That year, Brad Smith, then a senior vice president at the company and head of TurboTax, told a House committee that “the current Free File Alliance program has drifted very far from its original public service purpose and objective,” as he put it. The program wasn’t supposed to be for everyone, he said: It was for the “disadvantaged, underprivileged and underserved taxpayer populations.”</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="61.0">Intuit’s arguments quickly gained traction at the IRS. Already, in March 2005, the IRS had written to the Justice Department for legal advice on modifying the Free File program. The agency wanted to know: Would it run afoul of antitrust laws if the IRS barred companies in the Free File Alliance from offering a free product to everyone?</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="62.0">The Justice Department responded in a May 2005 <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6477776-DoJ-Free-File-Letter-to-IRS.html">letter</a>. Clearly, wrote Renata Hesse, an antitrust section chief at the department, “any agreement among Alliance members to restrict such free service is likely a form of price fixing” and thus illegal. But there was still a way for Intuit to get what it wanted. She wrote that if the IRS itself were to impose such a restriction, it would be legal.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="63.0">The IRS swooped in to beat back Intuit’s competition, doing for Intuit what the company could not on its own. Despite just 5 million Americans using a program that was purportedly available to 80 million, the IRS agreed that Free File needed to be reined in.</p>

            </figure>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="65.0">The agency made its reasoning clear in a previously unreported letter sent to the Free File Alliance the following year. Bert DuMars, then head of electronic filing at the IRS, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6477777-IRS-Letter-to-Free-File-Alliance.html">wrote</a> that there’d been a huge jump in people using Free File in 2005, but no corresponding boom in people paying for tax prep. “If this trend continued, the IRS was concerned that it could cause many vendors to go out of business,” he wrote. Stock market analysts, he pointed out, had said Free File “represented a threat to future revenues and profits of the publicly traded company participants.” The IRS decided to remove this threat.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="66.0">The new agreement, struck between the IRS and the alliance in 2005, gave Intuit what it had sought. Companies were now expressly barred from offering free tax prep to everyone through the program. Instead, only taxpayers under an income cap, then $50,000 a year, would be eligible.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="67.0">On paper, the program’s eligibility had actually increased to 70% of taxpayers, or about 93 million households, up from the previous 78 million. But in practice, because broad, easy-to-understand offers were now barred, it was clear the program’s use would decline.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="68.0">Intuit had again bent the power of the federal government in its favor. After 2005, the Free File program was never again as popular, eventually falling to about half that year’s level.</p>
	
<hr>

            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="69.0">With the threat of government encroachment on ice and high-speed internet access proliferating in the mid-2000s, Intuit looked forward to steady growth and big profits. The upside of the online software business was huge, with the cost of producing each additional unit approaching zero. And TurboTax was hardly a niche product: Intuit executives still excitedly talk about the TAM, total available market, of TurboTax as every single tax filer in the country, now over 150 million households.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="70.0">But TaxAct’s Free File gambit had forever transformed the industry. Advertising “free” was a great lure, so TaxAct took the battle to a different venue. Barred from making a free offer to everyone through Free File on the IRS’ website, TaxAct decided to make the offer on its own website in 2006. Intuit recognized a credible challenge from the upstart and countered the next year, launching TurboTax Free Edition on its website.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="71.0">Confusingly, there were now two distinct options: the government-sponsored Free File and the commercial free editions.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="72.0">For customers who managed to qualify, the new commercial options offered by these companies were similar to what they could get on the IRS’ Free File website: The underlying software was the same, only the federal return was free, and the companies expected to make money on each customer through charging for a state tax return or other services.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="73.0">But for the companies, there was a clear benefit to winning customers directly, rather than through the IRS program. The companies had complete control over how they handled customers from start to finish.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="74.0">Intuit poured ad dollars into its Free Edition. Not only did the new product effectively meet TaxAct’s challenge, it quickly became the major driver of TurboTax’s customer growth.</p>
                <figure data-pp-id="75" data-pp-blocktype="embed">
                    <h3>How Intuit Stopped Free File From Spreading</h3>
                                    <p data-pym-src="https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/embed-free-file-annotated?layout=embed">Loading...</p>
                    </figure>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="76.0">That growth posed a challenge: how to, as internal company documents put it, “monetize free.” Over successive tax seasons, Intuit unleashed teams of designers, engineers, marketers and data scientists on that problem, working at its headquarters in Mountain View and TurboTax’s main offices in San Diego.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="77.0">Part of the solution was to pitch users side products like loans or “Audit Defense.” But it also meant misleading customers. Frequently “free” didn’t mean free at all. Many who started in TurboTax Free Edition found that if their return required certain commonplace tax forms, they would have to upgrade to a paid edition in order to file.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="78.0">The company came to a key insight: Americans’ anxiety around tax filing is so powerful that it usually trumps any frustration with the TurboTax product, according to three former Intuit staffers. So even if customers click on “free” and are ultimately asked to pay, they will usually do it rather than start the entire process anew. Intuit capitalized on this tendency by making sure the paywall popped up only when the taxpayer was deep into the filing process.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="79.0">“There’s a lot of desperation — people will agree, will click, will do anything to file,” said a former longtime software developer.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="80.0">Every fall before tax season, the company puts every aspect of the TurboTax homepage and filing process through rigorous user testing. Design decisions down to color, word choice and other features are picked to maximize how many customers pay, regardless if they are eligible for the free product. “Dark patterns are something that are spoken of with pride and encouraged in design all hands” meetings, said one former designer. In the design world, “<a href="https://www.darkpatterns.org/">dark patterns</a>” are tactics to get users to do something they don’t necessarily mean to do. (ProPublica <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-just-tricked-you-into-paying-to-file-your-taxes">previously documented</a> dark patterns encountered by people trying to file their taxes for free.)</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="81.0">On TurboTax’s homepage, for example, the company carefully chooses how it describes the different editions. Prominently featured next to Deluxe Edition, which costs around $100, is the phrase “maximize your deductions.”</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="82.0">If users initially click on the Deluxe software, they are never offered the choice to go to the Free Edition even if the no-cost option would produce the same return. “Maximize your deductions” was legendary at Intuit for its effectiveness in steering customers eligible for free filing to buy the paid product, according to a former marketing staffer.</p>
                <figure data-pp-id="83" data-pp-blocktype="embed">
                    <h3>Intuit's Share Price Has Shot Up in Recent Years</h3>
                                    <p data-pym-src="https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/embed-intuit-stock-prices?layout=embed">Loading...</p>
                    </figure>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="84.0">Another celebrated feature, former staffers said, were the animations that appear as TurboTax users prepare their returns. One shows icons representing different tax deductions scrolling by, while another, at the end of the process, shows paper tax forms being scanned line-by-line and the phrase “Let’s comb through your returns.” What users are not told is that these cartoons reflect no actual processing or calculations; rather, Intuit’s designers deliberately added these delays to both reinforce and ease users’ “Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt.” The animations emphasize that taxes are complicated but also reassure users that the technological wizardry of TurboTax will protect them from mistakes.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="85.0">In a statement, the Intuit spokesman said, “The process of completing a tax return often has at least some level of stress and anxiety associated with it. … To offset these feelings, we use a variety of design elements — content, animation, movement, etc. — to ensure our customers’ peace of mind.”</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="86.0">The 2007 launch of Free Edition started a period of rapid growth for TurboTax. Within two years, use of its web products had almost doubled, and over the past decade, its website has grown each year by an average of 2 million more customers. The company reported this year that TurboTax online had handled 32 million returns. In a statement, it said around a third of that number used Free Edition.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="87.0">The government’s Free File program, meanwhile, has mostly faded into the background, drowned out by Intuit’s and other companies’ “free” offers. The IRS did try advertising campaigns, spending around $2 million some years to spread the word. But compared with the reach of Intuit, this was a pittance: The company reported this year that it spent $800 million on advertising. With its budget <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-irs-was-gutted">slashed</a> by Congress, the IRS has spent no money at all to advertise the program in recent years.</p>
            
	<hr>

            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="89.0">Amid its success, Intuit has sometimes had to put down insurgents bent on reforming the tax filing system. In 2007, the same year Intuit launched its Free Edition, Barack Obama, then a candidate for president, took aim at the tax prep industry. In a speech to an audience of tax wonks in Washington, he promised that the IRS would establish a simple return system. “This means no more worry, no more waste of time, no more extra expense for a tax preparer,” he declared.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="90.0">But the Obama administration, as Bush’s had before, found that it was no match for Intuit.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="91.0">Again, Bernie McKay, the lobbyist who had joined Intuit in the late 1990s and outlasted multiple CEOs, led the company’s campaign. In response to the Obama threat, McKay and Intuit’s small army of outside lobbyists turned to Congress, where lawmakers friendly to the company introduced a series of bills that would elevate Free File from a temporary deal with the IRS to the law of the land.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="92.0">Republicans have historically been the company’s most reliable supporters, but some Democrats joined them. <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/L000397-zoe-lofgren">Rep. Zoe Lofgren</a>, the California Democrat whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, has introduced or co-sponsored five bills over the years that would codify the Free File program, with names like the Free File Permanence Act. Lofgren’s spokesperson told ProPublica that the congresswoman believes the IRS, because of its role as tax collector, should not also be the tax preparer.</p>
                        
                
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="94.0">Hedging its bets, the company also sought to make sure the IRS could not spend a single dollar creating a public filing system. One internal document says Intuit would “advance legislative language in House Appropriations for ‘No Funds’ restriction on IRS spending” on such a system. It worked. Within a few years, Congress passed a 3,000-page appropriations bill that included a single sentence crucial to Intuit’s financial future: “<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6396945-PLAW-114publ113.html#document/p190">No funds</a>,” the law decreed, could be used “to provide to any person a proposed final return or statement.”</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="95.0">Another important aspect of Intuit’s influence strategy during the Obama years was covertly <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-maker-linked-to-grassroots-campaign-against-free-simple-tax-filing">enlisting</a> minority and women’s groups to press its case.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="96.0">The <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6483061-Intuit-TurboTax-2014-15-Encroachment-Strategy.html">internal 2014-15 “encroachment strategy” document</a> discloses plans to “leverage trade groups to support House/Senate Free File bills.” It goes on to list the groups Women Impacting Public Policy, The Latino Coalition and the National Black Chamber of Commerce.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="97.0">Intuit has given money to all of those groups over the years. All have signed letters urging Congress to make the Free File deal permanent. “The Free File program has been a clear success,” said one <a href="https://www.atr.org/conservative-coalition-free-file-solution-tax-complexity">letter</a> signed by The Latino Coalition and the Hispanic Leadership Fund.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="98.0">A spokesperson for Women Impacting Public Policy said it has received $70,000 from Intuit. The amounts given to the other groups are unknown, and they did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
	
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="98.1">Company documents also outline plans to “mobilize” a “coalition” that included think tanks and academics, who published op-eds.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="99.0">Will Marshall, president of the pro-business Progressive Policy Institute, opposed return-free filing in an <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-a-budget/293095-return-free-filing-proposal-is-not-tax-reform">op-ed</a> in The Hill because doing one’s taxes is “a teachable moment [that] prompts us to review our financial circumstances.”</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="100.0">Anti-tax activist Grover Norquist, the most consistent champion of Intuit’s policy positions, <a href="https://www.atr.org/taxpayer-advocates-issue-joint-free-file-a7496">warned</a> that “big spenders in Washington, D.C. want to socialize all tax preparation in America.”</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="101.0">It is unclear whether they were paid by Intuit or the Free File Alliance. Norquist didn’t respond to a request for comment, and a Progressive Policy Institute spokesman declined to say whether Intuit gave the group money.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="102.0">Whatever external challenges to the status quo Intuit has faced, the company has been able to rely on the IRS’ continuing enthusiastic support of the Free File program. Every few years, the IRS and the industry got together to renew the deal.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="103.0">In part, that was due to the relationships Intuit had developed with high-ranking IRS officials. One, Dave Williams, served as the agency’s top negotiator on the Free File program for several years and “was very commercially sensitive,” said Mark Ernst, the CEO of H&amp;R Block until 2007. Ernst, who later held a senior role at the IRS, told ProPublica that Williams “didn’t want to offend the industry,” noting that “he was particularly open to having sidebar conversations with key people where he could imagine himself landing some day.”</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="104.0">Today, Williams works at Intuit, where he’s held the title of chief tax officer since 2013. He is one of several former IRS employees who have gone on to work there. In a statement, Williams told ProPublica he did not have discussions about future employment with Intuit or other companies until after he left the IRS. He added that his career in government was focused on “what is best for the taxpayer” and that he “joined Intuit for the same reason: to help the American taxpayer.”</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="105.0">Despite Free File’s declining use, the IRS often claimed that the program was nevertheless meeting one of its original goals: driving more people to file electronically instead of on paper. Ernst, who served as a senior official at the IRS from 2009 to 2010, didn’t believe that a program used by so few people was having any such effect. “It was a talking point that got trotted out all the time to justify the Free File Alliance,” he said.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="106.0">Internally, IRS managers have also argued that the program is, in a way, a success, because it created “a free marketplace,” as one internal management <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6550454-2017-11-BPR-Page.html">report</a> in 2017 put it. Apparently, customers weren’t the only ones taken in by the word “free.”</p>

	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="108.0">In 2018, Intuit faced rare scrutiny from inside the IRS. The agency asked its Advisory Council, a group of outside experts, to take stock of Free File. To the company’s alarm, it soon became apparent that the council’s report might be sharply critical.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="109.0">That July, council chair and University of California, Davis, law professor Dennis Ventry wrote two pieces criticizing an Intuit-backed bill in Congress that would make the program permanent. His <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/395762-free-file-providers-scam-taxpayers-congress-cant-be-fooled">op-ed</a> in The Hill was called, “Free File providers scam taxpayers; Congress shouldn’t be fooled.”</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="110.0">In response, the IRS again rose to Intuit’s aid. It rushed to assure the company that Ventry’s power to affect the program was limited, according to <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6191309-Free-File-IRS-Records-FOIA.html#document/p14">emails</a> to the Free File Alliance obtained through a public records request.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="111.0">“The Commissioner has met directly with Mr. Ventry,” IRS official Ken Corbin wrote to Steve Ryan, a lobbyist for Intuit who also represented the alliance. “Mr. Ventry will recuse himself from participating or contributing to the topic of Free File.”</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="112.0">Corbin heads the IRS division that processes most Americans’ tax returns and negotiates the Free File deal with Intuit and the industry.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="113.0">A few days later, Ryan arrived at the IRS’ Constitution Avenue headquarters in Washington to mount a defense of the program. A former Democratic Senate aide turned lawyer-lobbyist, Ryan is known on Capitol Hill for taking on politically fraught clients, including Trump attorney Michael Cohen and the government of Qatar. He helped create Free File in the early 2000s, and it was now his job to secure its future.</p>
                        
                
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="115.0">Ryan’s <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6030111-FFA-PPT-Presentation-to-IRSAC-July-2018.html#document/p8">PowerPoint</a> presentation at the IRS rehashed arguments that the company had been making for the past 15 years. It also highlighted a 2013 study by Brown University professor <a href="https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Economics/Faculty/John_Friedman/">John Friedman</a>, a former Obama National Economic Council official, to make the point that the program had been successful in generating “Free Tax Returns <strong>Outside</strong> of Free File.” The presentation did not mention that Friedman’s study was paid for by the Free File companies and was not published in an academic journal. Friedman declined to say what he was paid but told ProPublica he “wrote the piece based on my analysis of the issues, which I stand by.”</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="116.0">Ventry, who attended the meeting, got a call the next day alerting him that a California public records request had been filed for his emails — they were subject to such a request because he’s an employee of a state university. It came from the Free File Alliance, as The New York Times later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/us/politics/freedom-of-information-requests.html">reported</a>. The request, Ventry believes, was designed to “freak me out.”</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="117.0">In early October, the council sent a version of its final report, which included a harsh appraisal of the Free File program, to the IRS to seek responses before releasing it publicly the following month.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="118.0">But in mid-October, just weeks before the report saw the light of day, the Free File industry group fired off an “<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6191309-Free-File-IRS-Records-FOIA.html#document/p9">urgent</a>” request to meet with IRS officials. The goal was to re-sign and “improve” the memorandum of understanding that governed the Free File program, according to the emails. The current agreement wasn’t expiring for another two years, but Ryan cited the “time urgency to make changes that will benefit taxpayers” in the coming tax season, adding, “I have not darkened your door in 2018 and need your … attention to this opportunity.”</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="119.0">The IRS’ Corbin signed the new deal on Oct. 31. Two weeks later, the Advisory Council report was released, with a damning indictment of the program: “The IRS’s <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5910811-Internal-Revenue-Service-Advisory-Council.html#document/p15">deficient oversight</a> and performance standards for the Free File program put vulnerable taxpayers at risk,” the report found.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="120.0">The expert body recommended that the IRS negotiate a series of new provisions designed to increase the use and oversight of the program, including mandating advertising by the companies. But it was too late. A new deal had already been signed with modest changes. As it had in the past, Intuit and the alliance had effectively insulated the program from reform. Members of the council, Ventry said, were “pissed off.”</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="121.0">A spokesman for the Free File Alliance said the group had pushed to renegotiate the deal in 2018 because of the looming 2020 presidential campaign. “The reason for the timing of the extension of the agreement was the political season,” he said. The group had not seen the report before its release, he added.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="122.0">(In August, ProPublica sued the IRS to get more correspondence between the agency and Intuit’s lobbyists. In response to our Freedom of Information Act requests, the agency has withheld over 100 pages. The case is ongoing.)</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="123.0">The new deal included rules that barred Free File companies from offering extra products to the relatively small number of users who access the program. This makes it much more difficult to convert those users into paying customers.</p>
            
    
                        
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="125.0">At around the same time, the industry took steps to make the program more difficult to find. Both Intuit and H&amp;R Block added code to their Free File websites that shielded them from search engines such as Google. The Intuit spokesman said the company increased paid search advertising for Free File “by nearly 80 percent” over the last year and has data showing more people found the program through online search this year than last year, but he declined to provide specific figures.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="126.0">What is clear is that Intuit’s business relies on keeping the use of Free File low. The company has repeatedly declined to say how many of its paying customers are eligible for the program, which is currently open to anyone who makes under $66,000. But based on publicly available data and statements by Intuit executives, ProPublica estimates that roughly 15 million paying TurboTax customers could have filed for free if they found Free File. That represents more than $1.5 billion in estimated revenue, or more than half the total that TurboTax generates. Those <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/here-are-your-stories-of-being-tricked-into-paying-by-turbotax-you-often-need-the-money">affected</a> include retirees, students, people on disability and minimum-wage workers.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="127.0">Customers, meanwhile, remain confused by Intuit’s myriad uses of “free,” and internal documents show the company knows it. Over just a two-week period this past filing season, Intuit received nearly 7,000 TurboTax customer calls in which the phrase “supposed to be free” was uttered, according to a company analysis. One customer complained that Intuit charged him even though “it says ‘free free free’ on the commercial.” The TurboTax representative responded: “That ad has been the bane of my existence.”</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="128.0">Even as TurboTax’s business thrived, 2019 has been a rocky year for Intuit’s long-running war against government encroachment. In April, the company was close to finally succeeding in its long-held goal to make Free File permanent. A bill called the Taxpayer First Act was sailing toward almost unanimous approval in Congress. But after ProPublica published a <a href="https://www.propublica.org/series/the-turbotax-trap">series</a> of stories about the program, including a story showing that <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-military-discount-trick-troops-paying-to-file-taxes">military families</a> and <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-tax-law-threatened-turbotax-profits-started-charging-disabled-unemployed-and-students">students</a> were particularly affected by Intuit’s business tactics, the bill stalled. Congress ultimately <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/congress-scraps-provision-to-restrict-irs-from-competing-with-turbotax">removed</a> the provision that would have enshrined Free File in law.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="129.0">After having enabled Intuit for so long, the IRS finally responded to the pressure. It hired a contractor to review the Free File program. But the contractor had <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/irs-funded-review-confirms-turbotax-hid-free-filing-from-search-engines-but-says-theres-no-need-for-major-changes">previously argued</a> against the IRS offering its own tax prep option, and the review did not recommend major changes. The agency has not yet announced its plans for the future of the program.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="130.0">The agency’s inspector general also launched an audit, which is ongoing. Other investigations and litigation followed, ranging from class-action complaints, alleging that consumers had been deceived by Intuit’s tactics, to investigations and lawsuits by regulators and prosecutors in New York and California. Intuit has denied wrongdoing, saying it “has at all times been clear and fair with its customers.”</p>
            
    
                        
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="132.0">Despite the scrutiny, Wall Street has continued to embrace the company’s business model. The company recently announced it made $1.5 billion in profits for its fiscal year. It expects its TurboTax unit to grow by 10% next year. Last year the CEO was paid $20 million. The share price hit an all-time record.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="133.0">The company has returned to its old strategy: stay the course and take its case directly to the IRS and Congress. Its allies in the Senate have again advanced an appropriations bill that would bar the IRS from developing its own tax filing system. In the spring, Sasan Goodarzi, a former head of the TurboTax unit who took over as CEO of the entire company in January, sought to reassure employees.</p>
            
	<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="134.0">“Our view is this will be in the press until there is a resolution with the IRS,” he said, according to the video obtained by ProPublica. “And we’re working with them and we feel very good about where this will end.”</p>
