<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’re a few years into a supposed artificial intelligence revolution, which could and should have been about reducing mundane tasks and freeing everyone up to do more interesting things with their time. Instead, thanks to the bloodthirsty nature of modern capitalism and an ideological crusade being waged by the tech industry, we’re now facing a world where many people’s livelihoods–like video game developers–are under direct threat.</p><p>These tumultuous times are of course being reported on everywhere you look, <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including on this very website</a>, but one area I’ve been curious about recently aren’t the broader moral and legal battles, but what the struggle looks like for the average dev who is now having to encounter AI in their workplace.</p><p>For this piece, I spoke with a number of people working in the video game industry or very close to it, including artists, game designers, and software developers. I asked them to tell their stories about their daily interactions and struggles with&nbsp;artificial intelligence in the workplace, and what it means for the jobs they've been trained and hired to do.</p><p>Each person’s name and workplace has been changed to protect their identity.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>[He] can’t even write a fucking email without using Chat GPT...</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Bradley </strong>is a veteran artist who works at a AAA video game studio. They describe the company as having been founded relatively recently, with investment coming from traditional AAA executives who “want to make money, and they are trying to figure out what game to make for that”.&nbsp;</p><p>They say their project’s art direction has been largely fuelled by AI prompts and generated imagery, all driven by their head Art Director, who is himself an experienced video game artist, but who now “can’t even write a fucking email without using Chat GPT”.&nbsp;</p><p>“In my interview with the company I was very clear that I do not like AI-generated content”, Bradley says, and adds that the team initially said that was fine, the tech was only being used for pitching purposes. But Bradley says the reality has proven vastly different, and that the studio has made increasing use of AI-generated imagery in their team's art pipeline.</p><p>“I have no idea how he ended up as an art director when he can’t visualise what he wants in his head unless can see some end results”, Bradley says. Rather than beginning with sketches and ideas, then iterating on those to produce a more finalised image or vision, Bradley says his boss will just keep prompting an AI for images until he finds one he likes, and then the art team will have to backwards engineer the whole thing to make it work.</p><p>“He doesn't know that the important thing isn't just the end result, it's the journey and the questions you answer along the way”. Bradley says that the studio’s management have become so enamoured with the technology that without a reliance on AI-generated imagery for presentations and pitches they would not be at the stage they are now, which is dealing with publishers and investors.&nbsp;</p><p>Bradley says they’ve threatened to quit if further attempts are made to use AI in the art pipeline. While the art team continues to resist the use of AI in creating actual concept pieces and assets for the game, it’s a different story when it comes to pitching the project to those publishers and investors.</p><p>“They’re finding it difficult to get funding because the game is being treated as a car salesman’s pitch, using AI-generated imagery to sell it without any actual substance or meat to back the vision up. The whole game is resting on a prompt ‘what if a game was…’, but with no idea if that would be fun, or how to make it fun. It’s madness”.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>I had a meeting with the CEO where he told me he noticed I wasn't using the Chat GPT account the company had given me. I wasn't really aware the company was tracking that.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Mitch </strong>has been working in software for over seven years. Having previously been employed in the defense industry, their last job was writing developer tools for a small tech startup creating an app. The company was built with some initial interest in artificial intelligence, though Mitch says this was met with “varying levels of scepticism” by employees.&nbsp;</p><p>“I was the most opposed”, Mitch says, “to the point where I felt it was a detriment. One team member who only ended up working there for a few months was very positive on it. The CEO was sceptical but felt like it could be a massive benefit if used correctly, and the other team members saw it as a fun toy that could occasionally be useful. So it was pretty broad across the board”.</p><p>Some at the company were uneasy with the technology early on, when the team initially had just a small AI plugin through which users could chat with the app. “On the way to the airport with a co-worker we talked about the introduction of these AI-generated plugins”, Mitch says. “Both of us felt incredibly uneasy with them. Despite [my coworker] finding AI to be a fun toy, he was worried that it wasn't what he had initially signed up for, and I had more or less the same sentiment. It didn't really boil over into anything at this point since the feature didn't go anywhere, but it was still notable”.</p><p>A few months later, things started to change. Mitch says the first signs of a deepening reliance on AI came when the company’s CEO was found to be rewriting parts of their app so that it would be easier for AI models to understand and help with. “Then”, Mitch says, “I had a meeting with the CEO where he told me he noticed I wasn't using the Chat GPT account the company had given me. I wasn't really aware the company was tracking that”.</p><p>“Anyway, he told me that I would need to start using Chat GPT to speed up my development process. Furthermore, he said I should start using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_(language_model)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Claude</a>, another AI tool, to just wholesale create new features for the app. He walked me through setting up the accounts and had me write one with Claude while I was on call with him. I’m still not entirely sure why he did that, but I think it may have been him trying to convince himself that it would work.”</p><p>Mitch describes this increasing reliance on AI to be not just “incredibly boring”, but ultimately pointless. “Sure, it was faster, but it had a completely different development rhythm”, they say. “In terms of software quality, I would say the code created by the AI was worse than code written by a human–though not drastically so–and was difficult to work with since most of it hadn’t been written by the people whose job it was to oversee it”.&nbsp;</p><p>“One thing to note is that just the thought of using AI to generate code was so demotivating that I think it would counteract any of the speed gains that the tool would provide, and on top of that would produce worse code than I didn’t understand. And that’s not even mentioning the ethical concerns of a tool built on plagiarism.”</p><p>Mitch says that over the 18 months they worked with the company, its CEO had transformed from someone mildly positive about AI to emphasising to workers that “AI was the future”. “In particular, he was of the belief that developers who are able to use AI to accelerate their process are going to win out in the future. I have seen this sentiment in other places worded as ‘an AI won't replace you, but a programmer who knows how to use AI will’. He didn’t believe that 18 months ago, but he absolutely believes it now”.&nbsp;</p><p>The AI’s poor code and a personal dislike of the technology meant that Mitch soon simply began ignoring their CEO’s instructions to use Chat GPT and Claude. A few months later, the entire company went bust. &nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>The only issue I am facing as a professional art director in games is that I just want them to leave me and my art teams alone.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Francis </strong>is both a consultant and artist in the video game industry, and so has worked alongside art teams as well as working with agencies, studios and publishers about their creative processes. “This means I have had some truly wild conversations about AI in a professional context that make me want to walk into the sea”, they say.</p><p>Since AI-generated imagery first blew up a few years ago, Francis has found that discussions both with consulting clients and potential employers for their own art has “shifted”. They believe that most employers and outsiders they speak to don’t see themselves as part of what Francis calls an ‘AI will replace artists!’ crowd, but are more like a ‘if we use AI it’ll make an artist’s life easier’ crowd, who think using AI in art will protect their artists, not displace them.</p><p>“What follows from these discussions is me explaining why, usually over hours rather than minutes, that these tools have no place in a professional game development pipeline or production and actually hinder the development of visuals”, Francis says. “I also find myself explaining to them how the iteration and 'idea' phase of a project is where the best stuff happens, how exploring things through artistic labor is where your best ideas come to fruition, and why would we want an AI (that we don't even own) to do that for us with art that isn't ours to use?”</p><p>“I am yet to have a team or gamerunner push back on me once I actually explain how these AI art generators work and how they don't contribute in a helpful way to a project, but I have a sense of dread that it is only a matter of time until that changes, especially given that I've gone the majority of my career with no mention of them to every second conversation having it mentioned.”</p><p>This all sounds <em>slightly </em>more optimistic than what other people I spoke with expressed, but Francis also added that a close family member is “neck-deep in the technology side of the AI industry”, and that “while conversation with them mostly gives me the desire to purchase cigarettes for the first time in a very long time, it also gives me insight into how these people feel when they say they are 'helping' my industry and 'innovating' to make artists' lives better.”</p><p>Francis says their understanding of the AI-pusher’s outlook is that they see the entire game-making process as a problem, one that AI tech companies alone can solve. “When I’m told 'Think of how much time you could be spending instead on making the actual game!', those who have drank the AI Kool-Aid don't understand that all this brainstorming and iteration <em>is </em>making the game, it’s a crucial everyday part of game development (and human interaction) and is not a problem to be solved.”</p><p>“My experience here is unfortunately not singular”, Francis says. “I have had many discussions with other game developers who interact with AI engineers and savants who believe our industry pipelines need 'fixing' by them and them alone. The only other similar experience I can think of as a comparison is a snake oil salesman insisting that their magic tonic will fix all of my problems that don't exist but they insist that I have.”</p><p>Francis believes that there’s a common thread running through both their lines of work: that those selling AI tools and those advocating for their use, whatever their best intentions, think that AI is solving a huge problem games industry workers are facing. “The only issue I am facing as a professional art director in games is that I just want them to leave me and my art teams alone so we can make cool art. There is no problem to be solved here”.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/04/kickout.jpg?w=1440&amp;h=810&amp;crop=1" srcset="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/04/kickout.jpg?resize=480,270&amp;quality=75 480w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/04/kickout.jpg?resize=960,540&amp;quality=75 960w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/04/kickout.jpg?resize=640,360&amp;quality=75 640w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/04/kickout.jpg?resize=1280,720&amp;quality=75 1280w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/04/kickout.jpg?resize=768,432&amp;quality=75 768w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/04/kickout.jpg?resize=1536,864&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/04/kickout.jpg?resize=1024,576&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/04/kickout.jpg?resize=2048,1152&amp;quality=75 2048w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/04/kickout.jpg?resize=1280,720&amp;quality=75 1280w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/04/kickout.jpg?resize=2560,1440&amp;quality=75 2560w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/04/kickout.jpg?resize=1440,810&amp;quality=75 1440w, https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/04/kickout.jpg?resize=2880,1620&amp;quality=75 2880w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"><figcaption><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/robot-kick-female-employee-out-office-2229371365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Drawlab19</a></figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote><p>It was a huge waste of time, and really felt like an affront to my own expertise, which is... why I was hired.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Ricky </strong>is a senior game designer who says they were often asked to use AI on their last project, initially with the goal of saving time on basic tasks. One example they shared was being encouraged to use Chat GPT to do things like “generate outlines of existing games and their systems so that we could use them as references and discussion points. The issue? [The outlines] were often wrong, and I'd spend more time fixing them than if I'd just done it the old-fashioned way”.</p><p>Since the AI was generating responses for games Ricky was already familiar with, they could easily see that those responses were fundamentally incorrect. ”When I say they were wrong”, Ricky says, ” I mean they were talking about systems that didn't exist, items that didn't exist, and outlines of enemies that had incorrect explanations of their behaviour”.</p><p>“There were more superfluous issues as well -- the whole thing read like marketing speak. There were buzzwords everywhere, it wasn't concise, and if I were to try and fix these issues using different prompts, or continuing my conversation with [the AI], well, then I'm just spending time prompt-engineering instead of just writing the fucking thing myself. It was a huge waste of time, and really felt like an affront to my own expertise, which is... why I was hired”.</p><p>Ricky says they were also asked to use Chat GPT as an “idea generator”, to help with tasks like “coming up with a bunch of interesting puzzles” or “creating ideas for enemies”, supposedly to both save time and provide inspirational starting points.&nbsp;</p><p>“It really weighed on the creativity of my role, and again, spat in the face of my expertise”, they say. “It wasn't just this though; the tool itself lacks the intent, context, and limitations of what we're doing. It doesn't have other aspects of the project, influences, references, or personal experiences in the back of its mind, because it doesn't have a mind. Whenever we design something for a game, it's drawn from somewhere, influenced by other things, and filtered through our own experiences as a human. These AI ideas lose ALL of that, turning it into an omega-corporate ‘back of the box’ list of ideas and features”.</p><figure><blockquote><p>I raised the concern that we shouldn't be doing any of this without consent from those actors...</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Sally </strong>is an animator and 3D artist whose most recent video game work was as part of an indie studio working on a VR game. They say that AI tools made deep inroads into life at the studio, beginning with the game’s creative directors and lead designers “playing around with Midjourney” before quickly deciding that they wouldn’t need to hire concept artists, then moving on to declaring that they wouldn’t need to pay <em>anyone at all</em> to create the game’s 2D assets, because those could just be generated by Midjourney then edited in Photoshop.&nbsp;</p><p>Sally began voicing their concerns directly with management when AI moved into the game’s voice work, as bosses began toying with new AI-generated lines trained on work previously performed by voice actors. “I raised the concern that we shouldn't be doing any of this without consent from those actors”, Sally says, “and was met with a very aggressive shutdown response which was that ‘it wasn't going to ship’ and would only be used as an internal tool, so it shouldn't be an issue at all”.</p><p>“This is pretty awful for the voice actors because there’s not really anything they can do if a studio decides to do something like this. [Studios] already have a bunch of their voice work, and often voice actors will just send the entire recording of their lines over at once. So a studio will have multiple takes of each line, and sometimes different variations of the same line, which is kind of a perfect example for something you could feed through AI”.</p><p>Sally was recently laid off from the studio, along with a few of their coworkers, and says that as far as they’re aware the studio’s plan for its next game is to use AI-generated animations trained on motion capture to replace the role of a human animator. “I think the last thing I want to add is just how frustrating it is having AI-generated art in a game that’s about to ship, alongside all the hard work that we human artists put into it. All because one of the directors wanted to cut down on ‘wasting time’ or ‘hiring one other person’”.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>[AI] has been an overwhelmingly negative and demoralizing force in my own personal workplace, no question about it.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Audrey </strong>is a veteran concept artist who has worked both as a freelancer and in-house at studios in the video game industry. With qualifications in both art and game design, they say that over the last few years the emergence of AI tech in the art world “has been an overwhelmingly negative and demoralizing force in my own personal workplace, no question about it”.</p><p>“My own use of AI in my current job has been minimal and against my own wishes and ethics”, they say. “Once in a blue moon I have been given a task that necessitated using AI to make very VERY quick concepts. And when I say ‘necessitated’, I would be told explicitly to use AI and make a ton of images to pick from, and I could then ‘make them look good later’. Depressing doesn’t begin to cover it”.</p><p>Audrey says that their work deadlines are “being completely fucked up as well”, as they will usually need to completely redraw AI-generated images that colleagues in other departments have relied on as placeholder art, which then shifts their own workflow and priorities.&nbsp;</p><p>Audrey says their team’s overall response to AI tech has been “mixed”. “Only a few specific people higher up like to use AI and will use it regularly, while the majority of the team is neutral or completely against using it”, they say. “My own personal opinion was quite vocal. I tried to be clear about my stance on using AI, and so did the rest of the art team. I gave multiple reasons for our company to stop or minimize using it; I’d ask about replacing images that were AI placeholders or if there was a way we could use art already made instead, all of which had mixed results”.</p><figure><blockquote><p>They never hired anyone for the artist position, and are using AI-generated art for their games.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Alfie </strong>is an experienced 2D artist in the video game industry. They recently interviewed at a startup games studio with millions in funding, and came away deeply affected by AI without even working there.</p><p>“This corporate, tech-backed startup near me were looking to hire an artist”, they say. “I went through their entire recruitment process, which took around five weeks, including a trip in person to visit them for several hours. I even took part in a brainstorming session for about an hour, where I ended up coming up with a production plan with some basic schedules. After around three weeks of not hearing anything back from them, they finally got in touch to say they wouldn’t be progressing with my application”.</p><p>Alfie wonders if the studio might have simply been using them for some free art and production consultation. “They never hired anyone for the artist position, and are using AI-generated art for their games”, they say. “There are zero artists on their team”.</p><p>Alfie has since joined a new studio, which <em>had </em>been experimenting with AI-generated imagery a few years back but abandoned its use entirely after finding the results neither accurate nor specific enough for in-game purposes. This studio changed course entirely, and Alfie’s hiring was part of a heavy investment in human art.</p><p>“I guess they realised that AI imagery can't solve all of your problems, and they realise just how precious real human artists are”, Alfie says. “A human artist will research the material properly, with all the nuances of human emotion and logic, and ultimately produce art assets that are historically accurate, game specific and have soul”.</p><figure><blockquote><p>...we have no other choice but to look for mundane work and give up our passion...</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Douglas </strong>is a voice actor whose jobs include recording lines for indie video games, and says their experiences discussing AI with potential employers "feels like screaming into a void". "I've gotten through to small indie teams", they say, "and some publishers have been empathetic and understanding when I try steering them away from AI, since it hurts already-struggling independent artists and actors. But it's always the larger corporations that are eerily silent and flat out seem to ignore anyone who wants to talk about the subject".</p><p>As an example, Douglas says Audible has recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24239903/amazon-audible-audiobook-narrators-ai-generated-voice-clones" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">begun trialling a system where actors can submit their recordings to an AI program</a> that will duplicate their voice, then sell it to book authors for their audiobooks. Those actors will then receive a small percentage of any income the AI 'voice' generates, but Douglas can easily see that becoming problematic for the market, with existing (and upcoming) voice actors able to be easily replaced by anyone looking for a "quick and easy" solution.</p><p>I asked Douglas how they and their peers are feeling about this, <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-voice-actor-strike-genshin-impact-destiny-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and other challenges being presented by AI in the voice acting space</a>, and their response was blunt. "Myself and a lot of my fellow voice actors are in the same boat", they say. "None of us feel like submitting our voice to an AI is worth the benefit, because it will destroy a lot of the human emotion we put into our work to help bring a story to life".</p><p>"A lot of us worked tirelessly to make even a fraction of a living doing something we genuinely love, and we're afraid of that being taken away from us, so it's looking like we have no other choice but to look for mundane work and give up our passion".</p><hr><p>These are just some people’s personal experiences, a small snapshot of how AI is affecting the games industry. While <a href="https://gdconf.com/news/gdc-2025-state-game-industry-devs-weigh-layoffs-ai-and-more" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surveys and numbers</a> can provide some sense of scale, individual experiences can highlight the precise ways AI is encroaching into people’s workplaces and lives, how they feel about it, and how they’re responding.</p><p>As grim as some of these responses feel, I hope there’s at least some small solace to be taken from the fact that so many artists remain firm in their resistance to AI technology that devalues their work, and are championing human creators in the face of it.</p><hr><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aftermath.site/baseball-week-2025" target="_blank">Inside Baseball Week</a>&nbsp;is our annual week of stories about the lesser-known parts of game development, the ins and outs of games journalism, and a peek behind the curtain at Aftermath.

<p><strong>October 02, 2024</strong></p>

<p>It’s been two years since I wrote my first production webservice with <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a>.
Two years is not a very long time, but early indicators suggest that the software projects I’ve written with htmx are a much better experience for users, and orders of magnitude easier to maintain, than the software projects they replaced.
They are likely to remain useful for longer than anything else I’ve ever written (so far).
Pretty good!</p>
<p>Like any new tool, especially a tool that got popular <a href="https://risingstars.js.org/2023/en#section-framework">as quickly as htmx</a>, there are differing schools of thought on how best to use it.
My approach—which I believe necessary to achieve the results described above—requires you to internalize something that htmx certainly hints at, but doesn’t enforce: use plain HTML <em>wherever possible</em>.</p>
<p>Once you get the hang of it, htmx starts pushing you in this direction anyway, and you start reaching for htmx less and less.
It requires a mindset shift though, especially if you’re not accustomed to <a href="https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/behavior-belongs-in-html/">building page behavior with HTML features</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-should-we-use-htmx"><a href="#how-should-we-use-htmx" aria-label="Anchor link for: how-should-we-use-htmx">How should we use htmx?</a></h2>
<p>In my opinion, most websites should be using htmx for either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Updates that users would not expect to see on a refresh (or a new page load)</li>
<li>Updates that would <em>also</em> be present on a refresh (or a new page load)</li>
</ol>
<p>Everything else should use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a">regular links</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form">regular forms</a> that do standard, full-page navigations.</p>

<p>Let’s say you’re making a website that shows today’s baseball games, and you want it to update the stats live.
Here’s how I would approach that.</p>
<p>The website’s home page should have all the currently-playing games on it, showing the live score for each one.
Each of those live scoreboards uses htmx to <a href="https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-trigger/#polling">poll the server</a> at regular intervals for updates.
Clicking on the scoreboard title (which is a regular <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> link) takes you to that game’s page, at its own URL.
The game page has not just the score, but the pitch count, the game’s full box score, and so on;
these update with htmx as well.</p>
<p>The idea here is that the website still has a sound URL structure, which is managed by the core browser functionality, while interactivity is carefully layered on top, with targeted updates.
Exactly what merits a targeted update versus a new page depends on what you’re building, but you should have a mental model that distinguishes between them in some capacity.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a lot of the beginner guides suggest that you can get started easily by “upgrading” all your links with <code>hx-boost</code>.
I disagree with this.
While htmx is amazing for targeted page updates, I highly discourage using it to take over <em>all</em> page navigation.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-hx-boost"><a href="#what-is-hx-boost" aria-label="Anchor link for: what-is-hx-boost">What is hx-boost?</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-boost/"><code>hx-boost</code></a> is an attribute that converts a “regular” link into a “boosted” link:</p>
<pre data-lang="html"><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;!-- normal link --&gt;
</span><span>&lt;</span><span>a </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>example.com</span><span>&gt;Example&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;
</span><span>
</span><span>&lt;!-- boosted link --&gt;
</span><span>&lt;</span><span>a </span><span>href</span><span>=</span><span>example.com </span><span>hx-boost</span><span>=</span><span>true</span><span>&gt;Example&lt;/</span><span>a</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Instead of doing a full page navigation when the “boosted” link is clicked, htmx will issue an HTTP request to the link’s URL and replace the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> of the page with the content of the response.
In theory, this feels “smoother” because it only repaints part of the page, mimicking the feel of a Single-Page Application (SPA).</p>
<h2 id="what-s-wrong-with-hx-boost"><a href="#what-s-wrong-with-hx-boost" aria-label="Anchor link for: what-s-wrong-with-hx-boost">What’s wrong with hx-boost?</a></h2>
<p>The problems it solves are better solved by other means, and it creates a lot of problems on its own.</p>
<p>Use <code>hx-boost</code> long enough, and something will go wrong.
You’ll click the back button and see only a partial page update;
you’ll refresh the page and it’ll go blank;
another library that you’re using will conk out;
elements will enter or exit the DOM in a way that you did not expect.</p>
<p>From a coding perspective, this is not anyone’s fault—the features promised by <code>hx-boost</code> are impossible.
<code>hx-boost</code> uses the JavaScript <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API">History API</a>, which exists to let single-page apps (SPAs) hook into session management functionality, most notably the browser’s forward and back buttons.
In practice, this is virtually impossible to get right, and is so annoying to implement that htmx creator Carson Gross made <a href="https://htmx.org/img/memes/javascripthistory.png">a meme</a> about it.</p>
<p>The core problem is that with normal page navigation, each link you click resets the JavaScript environment and triggers a full set of page <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/DOMContentLoaded_event">lifecycle events</a>.
This is a very good thing.
It means that every additional script you include on the page has a standardized way to keep track of what’s happening.
If you replace this process with an ad-hoc, scripting-based navigation, you remove access to that common language for every other library on your page.
You also initiate a long-lived JavaScript environment that is likely to eventually enter a bad state of some kind.</p>
<p>This problem is inherent to SPAs, and it can only be resolved by not writing SPAs.
So don’t use the attribute that turns your htmx site into an SPA.</p>
<h2 id="what-should-i-do-instead"><a href="#what-should-i-do-instead" aria-label="Anchor link for: what-should-i-do-instead">What should I do instead?</a></h2>
<p>Use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a">regular links</a>. <code>hx-boost</code> promises to enhance the experience of a regular link; skip the middleman and just use them.</p>
<p><a href="https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/hard-page-load/">Regular links are a better user experience and developer experience</a>, full stop.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-the-benefits-of-hx-boost"><a href="#what-about-the-benefits-of-hx-boost" aria-label="Anchor link for: what-about-the-benefits-of-hx-boost">What about the benefits of hx-boost?</a></h2>
<p>The first time you use <code>hx-boost</code>, it feels magical to have the page update “seamlessly” like that, but you can achieve all the same benefits, without the headaches, using browser features.</p>
<h3 id="send-cache-headers-to-re-use-css-and-js-across-page-loads"><a href="#send-cache-headers-to-re-use-css-and-js-across-page-loads" aria-label="Anchor link for: send-cache-headers-to-re-use-css-and-js-across-page-loads">Send cache headers to re-use CSS and JS across page loads</a></h3>
<p>Basically all static file servers support <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag">ETags</a>.
When the server sends the browser a file, it can also send a unique string that identifies <em>that version</em> of the file.
The next time you try to load that file (after, for instance, navigating to a new page that uses the same CSS), the browser asks your server, “is it still this one?”, and sends that ETag string.
If the file hasn’t changed, the server just responds with a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/304">304 Not Modified</a> header and the browser users its cached version.</p>
<p>In most cases, this is process adds essentially nothing to your load times.
The browser has to talk to the server anyway to get whatever info is on the next page, and it’s <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616#section-8.1">re-using the same TCP connection</a> to do so.
The GET -&gt; 304 back-and-forth is a handful of extra bytes on an already-open socket.</p>
<p>But if you don’t want the browser to even <em>ask</em>, you can do that do by setting a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control#response_directives">cache control header</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s how I load htmx in all the websites where I use it.
We’ll use version 1.9.3 as an example.
I include a script tag like this in the header:</p>
<pre data-lang="html"><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;</span><span>script </span><span>src</span><span>="</span><span>/htmx-1.9.3.js</span><span>"&gt;&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>When the user loads the page for the very first time, their browser sends the HTTP request <code>GET /htmx-1.9.3.js</code> to my server.
The server will send back something like this in response:</p>
<pre data-lang="http"><code data-lang="http"><span>HTTP/2 200
</span><span>accept-ranges: bytes
</span><span>cache-control: public, max-age=31536000
</span><span>last-modified: Fri, 06 Sep 2024 22:09:43 GMT
</span><span>etag: W/"24b79-191c962d458"
</span><span>content-type: application/javascript; charset=UTF-8
</span></code></pre>
<p>That says: “download htmx 1.9.3 from my server exactly once, and then never ask me for it again for <em>a full calendar year</em>.”
From that point on, for one year, every time that browser loads a page at the same domain that includes htmx 1.9.3, the browser won’t even ask the server for it, it’ll just use the saved version.
If I want to upgrade everyone to a new version, I just change the version number in the URL:</p>
<pre data-lang="html"><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;!-- From this... --&gt;
</span><span>&lt;</span><span>script </span><span>src</span><span>="</span><span>/htmx-1.9.3.js</span><span>"&gt;&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;
</span><span>
</span><span>&lt;!-- ...to this --&gt;
</span><span>&lt;</span><span>script </span><span>src</span><span>="</span><span>/htmx-1.9.4.js</span><span>"&gt;&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>The next time each of my users loads that page, their browsers will see that the page requires a new file it doesn’t have, and ask for the server for it again.</p>
<p>If I don’t even want to include a version number—maybe for a file like <code>stylesheet.css</code>—I can use a URL query.</p>
<pre data-lang="html"><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;!-- The browser will consider these two different files,
</span><span>      but your server will know that they're the same --&gt;
</span><span>&lt;</span><span>link </span><span>rel</span><span>="</span><span>stylesheet</span><span>" </span><span>href</span><span>="</span><span>/stylesheet.css</span><span>"&gt;
</span><span>&lt;</span><span>link </span><span>rel</span><span>="</span><span>stylesheet</span><span>" </span><span>href</span><span>="</span><span>/stylesheet.css?id=1</span><span>"&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Again, basically every static file server supports this pattern.</p>

<p>Chrome 76 came out four years ago, in 2019.
Everyone who built their website with regular links got a significant, free performance upgrade to their website pushed out to billions of people;

<p>Using standard HTML features allows the browser to optimize performance and UX in ways that JavaScript is categorically incapable of.
Every time the browser updates it is getting better at loading, parsing, and rendering webpages.

<p>htmx was created during a period in which it seemed like SPAs were the inevitable future of web development.
To compete in that environment, it had to demonstrate that it could replicate what most people considered to be the killer feature of SPAs: not repainting the whole page.
If this was ever necessary—I’m skeptical—it’s sure not necessary anymore.</p>
<p>Now that htmx has proven itself in the mindshare ecosystem, and developers are starting to trust multi-page websites again, I think the time has come to make the harder, but ultimately more impactful case: HTML and HTTP have the features required to build the vast, vast majority of website functionality; they’re easier to use than the scripting alternatives, and they last longer with much less maintenance.</p>

<p>Building good websites requires dropping the sugar high of <code>hx-boost</code> and saying “here’s how to use a cache header.”</p>
<h2 id="is-there-ever-a-time-i-should-use-htmx-to-make-an-spa"><a href="#is-there-ever-a-time-i-should-use-htmx-to-make-an-spa" aria-label="Anchor link for: is-there-ever-a-time-i-should-use-htmx-to-make-an-spa">Is there ever a time I should use htmx to make an SPA?</a></h2>
<p>My friend <a href="https://aramzs.xyz/">Aram</a> made a website called <a href="https://songobsessed.com/">Song Obsessed</a> that has a persistent music player which holds its state even as you navigate around the site.
<code>hx-boost</code> is a good fit for this because it allows you to construct your website as a series of URLs; you can just slap <code>hx-boost</code> on everything and, with a little tweaking, you can get htmx to leave the music player alone while replacing the rest of the page.
You still lost the reliability inherent in the hard page load, but you get genuinely novel functionality in exchange, which is a good trade in this case.
Until HTML has an API to keep live content persistent across page navigations, some SPA functionality is required to make that happen.</p>
<p>SPAs are an <em>advanced</em> tool that the industry deceptively marketed as a simple one.
Aram is a highly experienced web developer who’s using <code>hx-boost</code> to push the boundaries of what’s possible with page navigations;
Most people, who just want to add a little interactivity to their webpage, should <a href="https://grugbrain.dev/#grug-on-complexity">stick with the simplest tool available</a>: a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a">regular link</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://alexanderpetros.com/triptych/">Triptych</a>—the HTML proposals that Carson and I are working on—would render htmx obsolete for the type of website I describe here.
More advanced htmx features, like the ones used to great effect by <a href="https://david.guillot.me/en/posts/tech/following-up-mother-of-all-htmx-demos/">David Guillot and Contexte</a>, will still require htmx for the foreseeable future.</li>
<li>To add PUT (and DELETE) support to “regular” forms with htmx, add <a href="https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-put/"><code>hx-put</code></a> to the form, and then have the server respond with status code 200 and an <a href="https://htmx.org/headers/hx-redirect/"><code>HX-Redirect</code></a> header;
instead of doing partial page replacement, htmx will tell the browser to do a full-page navigation.
This mimics the POST-Redirect-GET pattern, but uses a header instead of a 303 response.</li>
<li>Ideally, htmx would be able to intercept a normal 303 response and use the <code>location</code> header, instead of a custom header, but because of limitations in the fetch API (<code>manual</code> redirects <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RequestInit#redirect">hide all the headers</a>), it can’t.
I don’t totally understand what security purpose this serves, to be honest, but it’s a bit of a shame, because it means that <a href="https://github.com/alexpetros/triptych?tab=readme-ov-file#limitations">you can’t make a proper polyfill</a> for PUT and DELETE forms.</li>
<li>Both <a href="https://dev.37signals.com/a-happier-happy-path-in-turbo-with-morphing/">turbo</a> and <a href="https://data-star.dev/essays/another_dependency#fn:1">datastar</a> use Carson’s <a href="https://github.com/bigskysoftware/idiomorph">idiomorph</a> algorithm to merge updates into the page, but Carson ended up rejecting idiomorph as the default merging algorithm for htmx, because it was too complicated—even though he’s the one who created it in the first place!
The default <a href="https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-swap/">htmx swap strategy</a> is to just wipe away what’s inside the <code>innerHTML</code> and replace it with the response—not unlike how the default page navigation is to wipe away the environment and give you a fresh one.
Simple; effective.</li>

            Complex neural circuits likely arose independently in birds and mammals, suggesting that vertebrates evolved intelligence multiple times.        </p>
        
    </div><div>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div data-role="selectable">
    <p>Humans tend to put our own intelligence on a pedestal. Our brains can do math, employ logic, explore abstractions and think critically. But we can’t claim a monopoly on thought. Among a variety of nonhuman species known to display intelligent behavior, birds have been shown time and again to have advanced cognitive abilities. <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/ravens-humans-and-apes-can-plan-future">Ravens plan</a> for the future, <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/animals-can-count-and-use-zero-how-far-does-their-number-sense-go-20210809/">crows count</a> and <a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/news/unique-beak-evolved-with-tool-use-in-new-caledonian-crow/">use tools</a>, <a href="https://www.audubon.org/news/wild-cockatoos-and-humans-compete-rubbish-prize-potential-arms-race">cockatoos open and pillage</a> booby-trapped garbage cans, and <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/content/article/mind/2019/chickadee-memory-food">chickadees keep track</a> of tens of thousands of seeds cached across a landscape. Notably, birds achieve such feats with brains that look completely different from ours: They’re smaller and lack the highly organized structures that scientists associate with mammalian intelligence.</p>
<p>“A bird with a 10-gram brain is doing pretty much the same as a chimp with a 400-gram brain,” said <a href="https://hahn-institute.de/en/research/group/biopsychology-guentuerkuen">Onur Güntürkün</a>, who studies brain structures at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany. “How is it possible?”</p>
<p>Researchers have long debated about the relationship between avian and mammalian intelligences. One possibility is that intelligence in vertebrates — animals with backbones, including mammals and birds — evolved once. In that case, both groups would have inherited the complex neural pathways that support cognition from a common ancestor: a lizardlike creature that lived 320 million years ago, when Earth’s continents were squished into one landmass. The other possibility is that the kinds of neural circuits that support vertebrate intelligence evolved independently in birds and mammals.</p>
<p>It’s hard to track down which path evolution took, given that any trace of the ancient ancestor’s actual brain vanished in a geological blink. So biologists have taken other approaches — such as comparing brain structures in adult and developing animals today — to piece together how this kind of neurobiological complexity might have emerged.</p>
<p>A series of studies <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adv2609">published in <em>Science</em></a> in February 2025 provides the best evidence yet that birds and mammals did not inherit the neural pathways that generate intelligence from a common ancestor, but rather evolved them independently. This suggests that vertebrate intelligence arose not once, but multiple times. Still, their neural complexity didn’t evolve in wildly different directions: Avian and mammalian brains display surprisingly similar circuits, the studies found.</p>
<p>“It’s a milestone in the quest to understand and to integrate the different ideas about the evolution” of vertebrate intelligence, said Güntürkün, who was not involved in the new research.</p>
</div>
    </div><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>The findings emerge in a world enraptured by artificial forms of intelligence, and they could teach us something about how complex circuits in our own brains evolved. Perhaps most importantly, they could help us step “away from the idea that we are the best creatures in the world,” said <a href="https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00132293">Niklas Kempynck</a>, a graduate student at KU Leuven who led one of the studies. “We are not this optimal solution to intelligence.”</p>
<p>Birds got there too, on their own.</p>
<h2><strong>Pecking Disorder </strong></h2>
<p>For the first half of the 20th century, neuroanatomists assumed that birds were simply not that smart. The creatures lack anything resembling a neocortex — the highly ordered outermost structure in the brains of humans and other mammals where language, communication and reasoning reside. The neocortex is organized into six layers of neurons, which receive sensory information from other parts of the brain, process it and send it out to regions that determine our behavior and reactions.</p>

<p>“For the longest time, it was thought that this is the center of cognition, and you need this kind of anatomy to develop advanced cognitive abilities,” said <a href="https://home.kaessmannlab.org/members">Bastienne Zaremba</a>, a postdoctoral researcher studying the evolution of the brain at Heidelberg University.</p>
<p>Rather than neat layers, birds have “unspecified balls of neurons without landmarks or distinctions,” said <a href="https://www.achucarro.org/people/fernando-garcia-moreno/">Fernando García-Moreno</a>, a neurobiologist at the Achucarro Basque Center for Neuroscience in Spain. These structures compelled neuroanatomists a century ago to suggest that much of bird behavior is reflexive, and not driven by learning and decision-making. This “implies that what a mammal can learn easily, a bird will never learn,” Güntürkün said.</p>
<p>The conventional thinking started to change in the 1960s when Harvey Karten, a young neuroanatomist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, mapped and compared brain circuits in mammals and pigeons, and later in owls, chickens and other birds. What he found was a surprise: The brain regions thought to be involved only in reflexive movements were built from neural circuits — networks of interconnected neurons — that resembled those found in the mammalian neocortex. This region in the bird brain, the dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR), seemed to be comparable to a neocortex; it just didn’t look like it.</p>
<p>In 1969, Karten wrote a “very influential paper that completely changed the discussion in the field,” said <a href="https://www.tosches-lab.com/">Maria Tosches</a>, who studies vertebrate brain development at Columbia University. “His work was really revolutionary.” He concluded that because avian and mammalian circuits are similar, they were <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1969.tb20442.x">inherited from a common ancestor</a>. That thinking dominated the field for decades, said Güntürkün, a former postdoc in Karten’s lab. It “sparked quite a lot of interest in the bird brain.”</p>

<p>A few decades later, Luis Puelles, an anatomist at the University of Murcia in Spain, drew the opposite conclusion to Karten. By comparing embryos at various stages of development, he found that the mammalian neocortex and the avian DVR developed from distinct areas of the embryo’s pallium — a brain region shared by all vertebrates. He concluded that the structures must have evolved independently</p>
<p>Karten and Puelles were “giving completely different answers to this big question,” Tosches said. The debate continued for decades. During this time, biologists also began to appreciate bird intelligence, starting with their studies of Alex, an African gray parrot who could count and identify objects. They realized just how smart birds could be.</p>
<p>However, neither group seemed to want to resolve the discrepancy between their two theories of how vertebrate palliums evolved, according to García-Moreno. “No, they kept working on their own method,” he said. One camp continued to compare the circuitry in adult vertebrate brains; the other focused on embryonic development.</p>
<p>In the new studies, he said, “we tried to put everything together.”</p>
<h2><strong>Same but Not the Same</strong></h2>
<p>Two new studies, which were conducted by independent teams of researchers, relied on the same powerful tool for identifying cell types, known as single-cell RNA sequencing. This technique lets researchers compare neuronal circuits, as Karten did, not only in adult brains but all the way through embryonic development, following Puelles. In this way, they could see where the cells started growing in the embryo and where they ended up in the mature animal&nbsp;— a developmental journey that can reveal evolutionary pathways.</p>
<p>For their study, García-Moreno and his team wanted to watch how brain circuitry develops. Using RNA sequencing and other techniques, they tracked cells in the palliums of chickens, mice and geckos at various embryonic stages to time-stamp when different types of neurons were generated and where they matured.</p>
<p>They found that the mature circuits <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adp3411">looked remarkably alike across animals</a>, just as Karten and others had noted, but they were built differently, as Puelles had found. The circuits that composed the mammalian neocortex and the avian DVR developed at different times, in different orders and in different regions of the brain.</p>
</div><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>At the same time, García-Moreno was collaborating with Zaremba and her colleagues at Heidelberg University. Using RNA sequencing, they created “the most comprehensive atlas of the bird pallium that we have,” said Tosches, who wrote <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adv2609">a related perspective piece</a>&nbsp;published in <em>Science</em>. By comparing the bird pallium to lizard and mouse palliums, they also found that the neocortex and DVR were <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adp5182">built with similar circuitry</a> — however, the neurons that composed those neural circuits were distinct.</p>
<p>“How we end up with similar circuitry was more flexible than I would have expected,” Zaremba said. “You can build the same circuits from different cell types.”</p>
<p>Zaremba and her team also found that in the bird pallium, neurons that start development in different regions can mature into the same type of neuron in the adult. This pushed against previous views, which held that distinct regions of the embryo must generate different types of neurons.</p>

<p>In mammals, brain development follows an intuitive path: The cells in the embryo’s amygdala region at the start of development end up in the adult amygdala. The cells in the embryo’s cortex region end up in the adult cortex. But in birds, “there is a fantastic reorganization of the forebrain,” Güntürkün said, that is “nothing that we had expected.”</p>
<p>Taken together, the studies provide the clearest evidence yet that birds and mammals independently evolved brain regions for complex cognition. They also echo <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/gene-expression-in-neurons-solves-a-brain-evolution-puzzle-20230214/">previous research from Tosches’ lab</a>, which found that the mammalian neocortex evolved independently from the reptile DVR.</p>
<p>Still, it seems likely there was some inheritance from a common ancestor. In a third study that used deep learning, Kempynck and his co-author Nikolai Hecker found that mice, chickens and humans <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.adp3957">share some stretches of DNA</a> that influence the development of the neocortex or DVR, suggesting that similar genetic tools are at work in both types of animals. And as previous studies had suggested, the research groups found that inhibitory neurons, or those that silence and modulate neural signals, were conserved across birds and mammals.</p>
<p>The findings haven’t completely resolved Karten and Puelles’ debate, however. Whose ideas were closer to the truth? Tosches said that Puelles was right, while Güntürkün thought the findings better reflect Karten’s ideas, though would partly please Puelles. García-Moreno split the difference: “Both of them were right; none of them was wrong,” he said.</p>
<h2><strong>How To Build Intelligence</strong></h2>

<p>Intelligence doesn’t come with an instruction manual. It is hard to define, there are no ideal steps toward it, and it doesn’t have an optimal design, Tosches said. Innovations can happen throughout an animal’s biology, whether in new genes and their regulation, or in new neuron types, circuits and brain regions. But similar innovations can evolve multiple times independently — a phenomenon known as convergent evolution — and this is seen across life.</p>
<p>“One of the reasons I kind of like these papers is that they really highlight a lot of differences,” said <a href="https://mcd.ucsc.edu/faculty/colquitt.html">Bradley Colquitt</a>, a molecular neuroscientist at the University of California, Santa Cruz. “It allows you to say: What are the different neural solutions that these organisms have come up with to solve similar problems of living in a complex world and being able to adapt in a rapidly changing terrestrial environment?”</p>
<p>Octopuses and squids, independently of mammals, evolved camera-like eyes. Birds, bats and insects all took to the skies on their own. Ancient people in Egypt and South America independently built pyramids — the most structurally efficient shape that will stand the test of time, García-Moreno said: “If they make a tower, it will fall. If they make a wall, it won’t work.”</p>
<p>Similarly, “there’s limited degrees of freedom into which you can generate an intelligent brain, at least within vertebrates,” Tosches said. Drift outside the realm of vertebrates, however, and you can generate an intelligent brain in much weirder ways — from our perspective, anyway. “It’s a wild west,” she said. Octopuses, for example, “evolved intelligence in a way that’s completely independent.” Their cognitive structures look nothing like ours, except that they’re built from the same broad type of cell: the neuron. Yet octopuses have been caught performing incredible feats such as escaping aquarium tanks, solving puzzles, unscrewing jar lids and carrying shells as shields.</p>
        
        
<p>It would be exciting to figure out how octopuses evolved intelligence using really divergent neural structures, Colquitt said. That way, it might be possible to pinpoint any absolute constraints on evolving intelligence across all animal species, not just vertebrates.</p>
<p>Such findings could eventually reveal shared features of various intelligences, Zaremba said. What are the building blocks of a brain that can think critically, use tools or form abstract ideas? That understanding could help in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence — and help improve our artificial intelligence. For example, the way we currently think about using insights from evolution to improve AI is very anthropocentric. “I would be really curious to see if we can build like artificial intelligence from a bird perspective,” Kempynck said. “How does a bird think? Can we mimic that?”</p>

Sushil Prasad, a 35-year-old technician, wipes the sweat off his brow as he carefully pieces together the guts of an old laptop. It is a daily ritual — resurrecting machines by stitching together motherboards, screens, and batteries scavenged from other trashed older laptops and e-waste — to create functional, low-cost devices.</p><div><p>“India has always had a repair culture … but companies are pushing planned obsolescence”</p></div><p>“Right now, there is a huge demand for such ‘hybrid’ laptops,” Prasad says, his hands swapping out a damaged motherboard. “Most people don’t care about having the latest model; they just want something that works and won’t break the bank.”</p><div><div><p><a href="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,0,100,100" data-pswp-height="1800" data-pswp-width="2700" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img alt="One of the streets where laptops are repaired at Nehru Place." data-chromatic="ignore" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) 50vw, 700px" srcset="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=256 256w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=376 376w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=384 384w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=415 415w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=480 480w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=540 540w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=640 640w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=750 750w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=828 828w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1080 1080w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1200 1200w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1440 1440w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1920 1920w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2048 2048w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400 2400w" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9989.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400"></a></p></div><p><figcaption><em>One of the streets where laptops are repaired at Nehru Place. </em></figcaption></p></div><div><p>Across India, in metro markets from Delhi’s Nehru Place to Mumbai’s Lamington Road, technicians like Prasad are repurposing broken and outdated laptops that many see as junk.

Many global manufacturers deliberately make repairs difficult by restricting access to spare parts, using proprietary screws, and implementing software locks that force customers to buy new devices instead of fixing old ones.</p><div><div><p><a href="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,0.055555555555557,100,99.888888888889" data-pswp-height="1798" data-pswp-width="2697" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img alt="Two boys transport discarded computer CPUs on a bicycle in Seelampur, one of India’s largest e-waste hubs, where informal recycling is a major source of livelihood." data-chromatic="ignore" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) 50vw, 700px" srcset="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0.055555555555557%2C100%2C99.888888888889&amp;w=256 256w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0.055555555555557%2C100%2C99.888888888889&amp;w=376 376w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0.055555555555557%2C100%2C99.888888888889&amp;w=384 384w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0.055555555555557%2C100%2C99.888888888889&amp;w=415 415w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0.055555555555557%2C100%2C99.888888888889&amp;w=480 480w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0.055555555555557%2C100%2C99.888888888889&amp;w=540 540w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0.055555555555557%2C100%2C99.888888888889&amp;w=640 640w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0.055555555555557%2C100%2C99.888888888889&amp;w=750 750w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0.055555555555557%2C100%2C99.888888888889&amp;w=828 828w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0.055555555555557%2C100%2C99.888888888889&amp;w=1080 1080w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0.055555555555557%2C100%2C99.888888888889&amp;w=1200 1200w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0.055555555555557%2C100%2C99.888888888889&amp;w=1440 1440w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0.055555555555557%2C100%2C99.888888888889&amp;w=1920 1920w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0.055555555555557%2C100%2C99.888888888889&amp;w=2048 2048w, https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0.055555555555557%2C100%2C99.888888888889&amp;w=2400 2400w" src="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/257643_Frankenstein_laptops_Delhi_DPandit_9183.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0.055555555555557%2C100%2C99.888888888889&amp;w=2400"></a></p></div><p><figcaption><em>Two boys transport discarded computer CPUs on a bicycle in Seelampur, one of India’s largest e-waste hubs, where informal recycling is a major source of livelihood.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Satish Sinha, associate director at Toxics Link, a nonprofit working on waste management, believes repair technicians like Prasad and Singh are on the front lines of a larger battle.</p><p>“India has always had a repair culture, from fixing old radios to hand-me-down phones.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://yossarian.net/til/post/any-program-can-be-a-github-actions-shell/">https://yossarian.net/til/post/any-program-can-be-a-github-actions-shell/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43617493">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>In GitHub Actions, you can use the <code>shell</code> keyword to specify the shell
that runs a given <code>run:</code> block. This keyword is optional for workflows
but mandatory for action definitions.</p>
<p>The shell normally defaults to something sensible for your runner,
e.g. <code>bash</code> on Linux and macOS, and <code>pwsh</code> on Windows. But it can also be
specified, and <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#defaultsrunshell">GitHub documents</a> that specifying it explicitly also
implies some flags of their choosing:</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>#</span> setting bash explicitly implies bash --noprofile --norc -eo pipefail
</span><span>-</span> <span><span>shell</span></span><span>:</span> <span>bash</span>
  <span><span>run</span></span><span>:</span> <span>|</span>
<span>    echo "Hello, world!"
</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Based on that, you might think that there's a fixed number of valid
<code>shell</code> values<sup><a href="#fn-toolcache" id="fnref-toolcache" data-footnote-ref="">1</a></sup>, which GitHub tracks and adds their special flags to.
But you'd be wrong!</p>
<p>As it turns out, you can set <code>shell</code> to any executable on the <code>$PATH</code>,
and GitHub will happily use it to execute the <code>run</code> block. If the command
doesn't already take a single file as input, you need to pass it
the special <code>{0}</code> argument, which GitHub replaces with the temporary file
that it generates the template-expanded <code>run</code> block into.</p>
<p>Thanks to this, we can do all kinds of cursed things.</p>
<p>Using C as our step runner <a href="https://github.com/woodruffw-experiments/actions-experiments/pull/3">works fine</a>:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>-</span> <span><span>run</span></span><span>:</span> <span>sudo apt install -y tcc</span>
<span>-</span> <span><span>shell</span></span><span>:</span> <span>tcc -run {0}</span>
  <span><span>run</span></span><span>:</span> <span>|</span>
<span>    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    int main() {
      printf("Hello, world!\n");
      return 0;
    }
</span></span></code></pre>
<p>...and so does <a href="https://github.com/woodruffw-experiments/actions-experiments/pull/5">dynamically modifying</a> the <code>$PATH</code> via <code>$GITHUB_PATH</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>-</span> <span><span>run</span></span><span>:</span> <span>|</span>
<span>    touch ./bash
    chmod +x ./bash
    echo '#!/bin/sh' &gt; ./bash
    echo 'echo hello from fake bash' &gt;&gt; ./bash
    echo "${PWD}" &gt;&gt; "${GITHUB_PATH}"
</span><span>-</span> <span><span>run</span></span><span>:</span> <span>|</span>
<span>    echo "this doesn't do what you expect"
</span>  <span><span>shell</span></span><span>:</span> <span>bash</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Does this matter from a security perspective? It's hard to say — there
are plenty of other ways in which file writes imply execution in GitHub Actions,
including <code>GITHUB_ENV</code> itself.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it's surprising (IMO) that GitHub does <code>$PATH</code> lookups even
for their "well-known" shell values; I would expect those to be fixed to
specific values (e.g. <code>bash</code> to <code>/bin/bash</code>), especially since they inject
flags into the <code>run</code>'s command line based on those well-known values.</p>
<section data-footnotes="">
<ol>
<li id="fn-toolcache">
<p>Or, more generally, that GitHub will accept any pre-registered tool in its toolcache. That, for example, is how I thought <code>shell: python</code> worked, before I noticed this. <a href="#fnref-toolcache" data-footnote-backref="" data-footnote-backref-idx="1" aria-label="Back to reference 1">↩</a></p>

The U.S. Treasury, State Department, and FBI collectively estimate the IT workers scam has generated hundreds of millions each year since 2018.</p></li></ul><p>About 95% of the résumés Harrison Leggio gets in response to job postings for his crypto startup g8keep are from North Korean engineers pretending to be American, the founder estimates. He even once interviewed a job seeker who claimed to have worked at the same Manhattan-based cryptocurrency exchange as he did, during the time he worked there.</p><p>Turns out it was all a ruse: The programming languages the engineer said the company used were incorrect, and he claimed to have floated among teams rather than embedding in a single group, which “wasn’t a thing there,” said Leggio.</p><p>Nowadays, Leggio told <em>Fortune</em> he won’t even set up an interview with a candidate who seems promising on paper unless they agree to one final step.</p><p>“Say something negative about Kim Jong Un,” Leggio tells potential job candidates, referring to the third-generation authoritarian Supreme Leader of North Korea, officially the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). Through research, Leggio learned insulting the DPRK’s Supreme Leader is forbidden, and North Korean citizens could face serious punishment for showing anything less than reverence.</p><p>“The first time I ever did it, the person started freaking out and cursing,” said Leggio.</p><p>The job seeker subsequently blocked Leggio across all social media platforms. Now Leggio makes the same request before every single interview. Other startups and founders he knows are asking the same thing of job seekers, he said.</p><h2>A yacht versus a missile</h2><p>The UN estimated the North Korean IT worker scam has generated <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/08/10/nashville-man-north-korean-remote-work-jobs-weapons-program-laptop-farm/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=advanced_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$250 million to $600 million;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">$250 million to $600 million</a>&nbsp;every year since 2018. As a result, cybersecurity experts of all stripes have banded together to <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/research/inside-the-scam-north-koreas-it-worker-threat" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:share information;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">share information</a> about the strategies, profiles, VPNs, and signs to watch for. But AI has emboldened the North Korean scheme, allowing the IT workers to develop scripts so they can hold down as many as six or seven jobs at a time, disguise their appearance, and even alter their voices so they don’t have an accent—or so they sound like a woman instead of a man. Experts <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/dprk-it-workers-expanding-scope-scale" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:predict;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">predict</a> the scope and scale will expand in 2025, moving across Europe and Asia with well-honed social engineering tactics paired with more aggressive job hunting at European defense and government companies.</p><p>Michael Barnhart, an intelligence leader at <a href="https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Google;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">Google</a> Cloud who has been <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/mitigating-dprk-it-worker-threat" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tracking;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">tracking</a> North Korean threats for years, explained the scheme this way: North Korean engineers, deployed to locations in China and Russia, use AI to create bios with eye-catching company experience highlighted. They work in teams to apply for jobs en masse, using stolen American identities, or with the help of <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-disrupts-north-korean-remote-it-worker-fraud-schemes-through-charges-and" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:facilitators;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">facilitators</a> in the U.S. or abroad. Some IT workers have even created <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/media/1320161/dl?inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:front companies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">front companies</a> to pose as legitimate recruiting firms or web-design agencies, for instance, that larger Fortune 500 companies then hire—not realizing it’s a North Korean front, said Barnhart.</p><p>“Right now, we have North Korean IT workers adapting so much that they’re not even doing IT work anymore,” he told <em>Fortune</em>.</p><div id="recirc-8d154401-37c0-38b5-b071-eb5cc8cc8ee4"><h2>More in World</h2></div><p>Among global companies, security teams have implemented different systems and strategies for rooting out North Korean IT workers seeking jobs as well as those already employed and working at companies, Barnhart said. And the stakes couldn’t be higher. The FBI <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250123" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reported;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">reported</a> the money funds nuclear weapons and operations, and the intelligence and data the IT workers illegally pilfer from companies is directed toward extortion, espionage, and data theft.</p><p>“There are criminals who steal your money to get yachts, but in this case, your money isn’t going to a Lamborghini—it’s going back to fund nuclear munitions,” said Barnhart. “A yacht versus a missile—attribution matters.”</p><h2>300-plus incidents in 2024</h2><p>Bojan Simic, CEO of identity-verification firm Hypr, built a product specifically for companies to verify people's identities because of the North Korean threat, he told <em>Fortune</em>. As a tech founder, he also deals with the issue within his own company. Simic accidentally hired an engineer who did a great job during the interview, but then the person who showed up to be onboarded on their first day wasn’t the person he hired. The engineer also failed a geolocation check, Simic said, and appeared to be in Spain when he claimed to live in Poland.</p><p>Emi Chiba, a senior principal analyst at <a href="https://fortune.com/company/gartner/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Gartner;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">Gartner</a> who has been researching the issue, told <em>Fortune</em> security experts should partner with internal human-resources teams to periodically re-verify the identities of employees and strengthen <a href="https://www.farnsworthintelligence.com/north-korean-it-farms-ioc-document-and-recommendations" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recruiting practices;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">recruiting practices</a>. The goal is to ensure job candidates aren’t hiding their locations overseas and pretending to be based in the U.S. Those practices range from camera-on video interviews to using identity verification tools with geolocation features to compare a government ID with a selfie, which would help match people to their identities and locations, she said.</p><p>“One of the biggest things you can do to combat this is training up HR staff,” added Barnhart.</p><p>Despite the efforts to disrupt it, cybersecurity company CrowdStrike <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/global-threat-report/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reported;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">reported</a> North Korean IT workers, a group it calls Famous Chollima, were behind 304 incidents in 2024, and its activities ramped up during the latter half of the year. In its latest assessment, CrowdStrike predicted Famous Chollima will continue its campaigns in 2025 given the financial success it’s seen and limited impact from federal prosecutions and government indictments last year.</p><p>Adam Meyers, senior vice president of CrowdStrike’s counter adversary team, told <em>Fortune </em>Famous Chollima has two main tentacles. One is a <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/12/14/north-korea-lazarus-crypto-hack-immunefi-2023-cybercrime/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:malware operation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">malware operation</a> that focuses on intelligence collection and <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/02/26/north-korea-hackers-crypto-heist-bybit-dubai-ether/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:crypto theft;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">crypto theft</a>, like the $1.5 billion cryptocurrency heist from a Dubai exchange. The other is the IT workers scam in which North Korean engineers get legitimate jobs and remit their salaries to North Korea to fund <a href="https://www.hrnk.org/documentations/slaves-bomb-role-north-koreas-nuclear-scientists/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nuclear weapons;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">nuclear weapons</a>, operations, and trade. The two prongs also work together to share intelligence.</p><p>In the IT worker scheme, once someone involved gets an interview, North Koreans use remote-desktop tools to help coach people through the Q&amp;A with a recruiter.</p><p>Aidan Raney, founder of Farnsworth Intelligence, posed as an American willing to help North Koreans to investigate the issue for a client who almost hired a fake engineer. During the course of two video calls with three or four people who all said their names were “Ben,” Raney learned the details. “The Bens” would handle all the upfront work for him—creating a fake <a href="https://fortune.com/company/linkedin/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:LinkedIn;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">LinkedIn</a> profile to verify his new identity for U.S. recruiters, formulating a bio, and sending it out to dozens of job postings with a new Gmail address they set up.</p><p>The Bens even modified Raney’s headshot to a black-and-white photo so it wouldn’t resemble his usual picture, Raney told <em>Fortune</em>. If Raney got a job, he would show up for meetings, like a morning stand-up or scrum, and go about his day while a North Korean engineer handled the workload. Raney would be allowed to keep 30% of the salary but had to transfer 70% to the Bens using crypto, Paypal, or Payoneer.</p><p>“What they were trying to do was use my identity to bypass background checks, and so they wanted this fake persona they created to be extremely close to the real-life version,” said Raney.</p><p>The Bens got Raney an interview, and while it was ongoing, they used a remote-desktop application to set up a notepad on Raney’s screen so they could write out responses to the questions from the interviewer, Raney explained. And it worked: Raney got a verbal offer for a job with a private government contractor that paid $80,000 a year.</p><p>He then had to immediately turn around and tell the company he couldn’t accept the offer and apologize for claiming their time.</p><p>“Now that they’re using real Americans who have verified identities and documents and they’re using their real faces—everything looks real,” said Raney. “There would be nothing stopping them from being hired.”</p><p>In the past two years, the Department of Justice has <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1380081/dl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:indicted;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">indicted</a> dozens of North Korean citizens and unnamed coconspirators in the scheme, charging them for stealing American identities, conspiracy to violate U.S. sanctions, wire fraud, and money laundering.

      <section>
        <p>"It's impossible to kill a media brand," Jim Spanfeller told me on my first day working for him, as we sat in his corner office. He had just bought the business news organization, <a href="https://qz.com/?ref=zachseward.com">Quartz</a>, that I had <a href="https://www.zachseward.com/thank-you-quartz/" rel="noreferrer">spent the past decade</a> building and, most recently, trying desperately to save from oblivion. So I was inclined to believe him.</p><p>But I knew it wasn't true. Jim and his <a href="https://www.greathillpartners.com/?ref=zachseward.com">private-equity-backed</a> digital-media conglomerate <a href="https://g-omedia.com/?ref=zachseward.com">G/O Media</a> had already destroyed several of their properties, some all at once (<a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/01/775548069/after-days-of-resignations-the-last-of-the-deadspin-staff-have-quit?ref=zachseward.com">Deadspin</a>), most of the others by sapping resources, antagonizing their staff, and undermining the editorial visions that once made them great (<a href="https://www.thewrap.com/jezebel-editor-in-chief-laura-bassett-quits/?ref=zachseward.com">Jezebel</a>, <a href="https://www.gawkerarchives.com/media/what-happened-at-the-root?ref=zachseward.com">The Root</a>). It would take him three years to do the same to Quartz.</p><p>The end came on Friday, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gmgunion.bsky.social/post/3llz7s5jeok2c?ref=zachseward.com">when G/O fired</a> the few remaining writers at Quartz and <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/redbrick-acquires-quartz-g-o-192800730.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJr-lIw5hUIOZAtf2jxkJ_405wdnXtaEEzpxsQIiysw-ByR1A3LFzdYqEXcChDmP4ShKL3W7xbAUQsj7Ko1U7-jt1WLcsWNoJYB2BpmEWRbSZcuCuh-4XgOWLjIu55vdotvmgkqFXP71_YyHV9LIgjgtDBEA9rExP-CQ8x-XdLar&amp;ref=zachseward.com">sold the carcass</a> to a Canadian firm that appears mostly interested in the email list. I thought back to Jim's comment. His cynical view of digital media was good neither for journalism nor business, but maybe Jim was right about that one thing. What is Quartz now if not a "media brand" that refuses to die?</p>

<p>We <a href="https://qz.com/6014/hello-world-a-welcome-letter-from-our-editor-in-chief?ref=zachseward.com" rel="noreferrer">launched Quartz</a> in 2012 with <a href="https://www.adweek.com/performance-marketing/the-atlantic-names-gideon-lichfield-global-news-editor-of-quartz/?ref=zachseward.com">prestigious editorial hires</a>, a <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2012/09/quartz-the-new-biz-news-site-is-a-technological-and-structural-innovator-with-only-a-few-hiccups/?ref=zachseward.com">slick new website</a>, <a href="https://allthingsd.com/20120924/quartz-shoots-for-tablet-and-mobile-readers-but-doesnt-arm-itself-with-an-app/?ref=zachseward.com">bold pronouncements</a> about the future of media, and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/24/business/media/with-digital-only-quartz-atlantic-to-cover-business-world.html?unlocked_article_code=1.9U4.DvAc.tBenqzXRhaA0&amp;smid=url-share&amp;ref=zachseward.com">splashy profile</a> in The New York Times in which we likened ourselves to a "pirate ship attacking the Royal Navy." It sure felt that way. From a <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2015/05/quartz-is-an-api-the-path-ahead-for-the-business-site-thats-reshaping-digital-news/?ref=zachseward.com#:~:text=That%20image%20reminds%20me%20of%20another%20one%2C%20a%20photograph%20that%20Kevin%20%5BDelaney%2C%20Quartz%20editor%2Din%2Dchief%20and%20president%5D%20took%20of%20the%20first%20Quartz%20office%20in%20SoHo%20about%20three%20years%20ago.%20Look%20at%20all%20that%20room!">spare SoHo loft</a>, and then increasingly <a href="https://www.officelovin.com/2017/10/tour-quartzs-sleek-new-nyc-office/?ref=zachseward.com">fancier offices</a>, we set out to be compelling, entertaining, serious, and excellent all at the same time. Everything was up for reinvention, from the <a href="https://martinbelam.com/2013/smartden-kevin-delaney/?ref=zachseward.com">structure of our stories</a> to the <a href="https://digiday.com/media/quartz-guide-making-ads-dont-suck/?ref=zachseward.com">design of our ads</a> to the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3054334/traditional-homepages-are-obsolete-says-quartz-heres-what-they-built-instead?ref=zachseward.com">need for a traditional homepage</a>. We believed that a news organization should stand for something, which in our case was <a href="https://qz.com/832998/the-case-for-free-trade-open-borders-and-the-new-global-economy?ref=zachseward.com" rel="noreferrer">globalism</a>. Most of all, we put a strong <a href="https://awards.journalists.org/entries/qz-com/?ref=zachseward.com">emphasis on quality</a> at a time when online journalism was still considered inferior to print publications that happened to have websites.</p><p>I think, in all those respects, we succeeded. Nothing about what ultimately transpired makes me regret the choices we made or the fun that we had. Quartz produced a lot of <a href="https://blog.qz.com/quartz-awards-2019-edition-ab067db5b1a9?ref=zachseward.com">great journalism</a>, served <a href="https://www.zachseward.com/presumed-audiences-in-digital-media/">our readers</a> well, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/07/business/media/quartz-delaney-out.html?ref=zachseward.com#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%E2%80%99m%20really%20proud%20of%20how%20Quartz%20has%20helped%20to%20fundamentally%20redefine%20the%20media%20industry%E2%80%99s%20approach%20to%20journalism%2C%20product%2C%20and%20advertising%20%E2%80%94%20and%20connected%20with%20tens%20of%20millions%20of%20readers%20around%20the%20world%20along%20the%20way%2C%E2%80%9D%20Mr.%20Delaney%20said%20in%20a%20statement.">widely influenced</a> the rest of our industry. If that's all Quartz was in the end, I'll take it.</p><p>Still, we also hoped to endure on the scale of centuries, just like rival news organizations — in particular, The Financial Times, The Economist, and The Wall Street Journal — that we viewed as our Goliaths. For a stretch in the middle there, it <a href="https://mashable.com/archive/quarts-tops-economist-traffic?ref=zachseward.com">even seemed possible</a>. But Quartz never made money. We grew, between 2012 and 2018, to nearly 250 employees and $35 million in annual revenue. The dismal economics of digital media meant losing more than $40 million over that stretch just to grow unsustainably large. A trade publication, which <a href="https://digiday.com/media/is-quartz-the-very-model-of-a-modern-publisher/?ref=zachseward.com">once called</a> Quartz "the very model a modern publisher," started <a href="https://digiday.com/future-of-tv/quartz-sees-video-subscriptions-driver/?ref=zachseward.com">literally portraying us</a> as pushing a boulder up a hill. Someone on our staff printed out the illustration and stuck it to a wall in our office, where it remained until the end.</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>§</p>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Twenty-eighteen would prove to be the peak of the endeavor and, not incidentally, the year our original owner, David Bradley, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/02/business/dealbook/quartz-atlantic-media-uzabase.html?ref=zachseward.com">decided to sell</a>. Quartz had <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3260d3a0-9f86-11e5-beba-5e33e2b79e46?ref=zachseward.com">attracted takeover interest</a> over the years from major media companies like <a href="https://www.iac.com/?ref=zachseward.com">IAC</a> and <a href="https://www.nytco.com/?ref=zachseward.com">The New York Times</a> and even, to our astonishment, the luxury fashion house <a href="https://www.lvmh.com/en?ref=zachseward.com">LVMH</a>. Their interest ultimately fizzled. It was a small Japanese financial data firm, <a href="https://www.uzabase.com/en/?ref=zachseward.com">Uzabase</a>, that made the highest and final bid, at $86 million.</p><p>As business journalists, we of course recognized that Quartz was fundamentally a financial asset subject to the whims of market forces beyond our control. I may have known it intellectually, but still viewed Quartz <a href="https://qz.com/1930012/join-our-mission-to-make-business-better-as-quartz-becomes-an-independent-media-company?ref=zachseward.com">as a movement</a> out to prove something more noble. So when Uzabase <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/quartz-is-put-on-the-block-just-two-years-after-sale-11602034051?ref=zachseward.com">gave up on us</a> two years later, at the height of the pandemic, I quixotically decided to <a href="https://blog.qz.com/quartz-acquired-by-co-founder-and-ceo-zach-seward-in-management-buyout-1cd3eda1fd81?ref=zachseward.com">buy the company</a> myself. The price tag was <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/11/10/financial-website-quartz-may-have-been-sold-for-1-sources-say/?ref=zachseward.com">next-to-nothing</a> but also required financing the buyout and taking on the risk of surviving, for the first time, as an independent company.</p><p>The two years we spent on our own was the most challenging stretch of my tenure at Quartz. I started having panic attacks. One morning shortly after the buyout, I fainted and fell limp to the floor of my bedroom. But it was also a freeing time. A <a href="https://blog.qz.com/quartz-welcomes-new-reporters-based-in-taipei-nairobi-new-york-and-san-francisco-301a89ec7fd0?ref=zachseward.com">new generation</a> of employees breathed life into our journalism and <a href="https://qz.com/1999070/quartz-essentials-our-way-of-extracting-knowledge-from-the-news?ref=zachseward.com">products</a>, while financial independence gave the company, which I incorporated as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_corporation?ref=zachseward.com">public benefit</a> corporation, <a href="https://qz.com/1878256/what-is-the-purpose-of-business-journalism?ref=zachseward.com">new purpose</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paycheck_Protection_Program?ref=zachseward.com">Paycheck Protection Program</a>, for small businesses affected by the pandemic, helped keep us afloat.</p><p>Investors who specialized in "distressed assets" would call from time-to-time. They all had the same idea: Fire most of the staff and reboot Quartz as an email-only publication focused on aggregation of business news. As a business model, it might have made sense, but it wasn't appealing. Muddling along with few or no journalists would be a worse outcome, I felt, than just shutting the place down.</p><p>That is how I came to realize Quartz was, and always had been, <a href="https://qzlife.tumblr.com/?ref=zachseward.com">its people</a>. The hundreds of people who built and constantly rebuilt Quartz, who did the work, who supported each other through all the changes, who gave the place <a href="https://blog.qz.com/quartz-life-end-of-the-year-awards-bd8695496fe9?ref=zachseward.com#:~:text=In%20celebration%20and%20recognition%20of%20this%20work%2C,Force%20of%20Ideas%2C%20and%20Spirit%20of%20Generosity.">its values</a>, and who brought those values to other companies when they moved on. (Quartz alumni are all over today's great media companies, 22 of us at The Times alone.) We really did believe in what we were doing.</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>So how did such an earnest enterprise end up in the maws of private equity? By 2022, we were running short of cash and didn't have anyone willing to put up more money, especially as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/business/media/buzzfeed-digital-media-wrong.html?ref=zachseward.com">enthusiasm waned</a> for the entire digital-media sector. We put together a quick M&amp;A process and made clear that preference would go to anyone willing to take on all of the roughly 80 people still working at Quartz.</p><p>G/O was the only suitor willing to make that commitment, and still bid three times more than the next-highest offer. That meant there was enough cash in the deal to share <a href="https://talkingbiznews.com/media-news/quartz-ceo-seward-to-staff-youll-get-a-cut-of-the-sale/?ref=zachseward.com">more than $1 million</a> of the proceeds with employees, who each got a stake in Quartz when we went independent. It was a far better outcome than I thought possible when we started the process, just desperate to survive.</p><p>My own investment would also turn out well, thanks to G/O's stubborn insistence that it only wanted Quartz's assets and not the corporate entity, which for complicated accounting reasons was still pretty valuable. I mention all these details, I must admit, out of spite. Jim would often talk about his feeling that journalists were bad businesspeople and taunt us about past decisions by asking, "How'd that work out for you?" Now G/O is in retreat, and today's strongest for-profit media companies are <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/?ref=zachseward.com">run</a> <a href="https://www.dowjones.com/?ref=zachseward.com">by</a> <a href="https://www.axios.com/?ref=zachseward.com">former</a> <a href="https://www.nytco.com/?ref=zachseward.com">reporters</a>.</p><p>At one point late in the sale process, Jim acted like he was no longer interested, and stopped returning my calls. That forced us to stare down the prospect of running completely out of cash and collapsing, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/jan/31/the-messenger-news-startup-shutters?ref=zachseward.com">Messenger-style</a>, as Jim well knew. We had no choice but to call his bluff. He went ahead with the purchase.</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<p>§</p>
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>I put on a <a href="https://medium.com/@quartz/quartz-acquired-by-g-o-media-f22e0da98010?ref=zachseward.com">brave face</a>, but we were under no illusions about the likely fate of Quartz under G/O's ownership. The sale immediately prompted obituaries; New York magazine <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/04/quartz-media-history.html?ref=zachseward.com">deemed us</a> "the history of internet media in just 10 years," which I still take as a compliment, even though we wanted 100 years.</p><p>It's still not quite clear to me what Jim thought he was buying or why he was so desperate to have it. In the subject line of his email announcing the deal, he spelled our name "<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jim-spanfeller-proudly-announces-purchase-of-quarts-its-quartz/?ref=zachseward.com">Quarts</a>," and that set the tone for the level of care in what he had bought. But borrowing money was still incredibly cheap at that time (interest rates were <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/fed/fed-rate-hikes-2022-2023-timeline-discussion?ref=zachseward.com">about to surge</a>, another case of good timing), and I guess the allure of an existing media brand was too hard to resist. In retrospect, "it's impossible to kill" sounds to me less like an adage and more like a challenge.</p><p>Everyone who could quit did so as soon as they could. A few diehards held on longer, and were tortured or fired, or both, for their sacrifice. I left on the day my contract allowed it, exactly a year after the sale. G/O ultimately filled up the site with <a href="https://qz.com/7-weird-tourist-attractions-u-s-mexico-thailand-1851772879?ref=zachseward.com">2000s-era slideshows</a> and <a href="https://futurism.com/quartz-ai-generated-articles-slop-errors?ref=zachseward.com">AI-generated earnings stories</a>. It took another two years for me to process the loss and for G/O to complete its demolition.</p><p>The media business often feels like a battle between idealists and cynics. Most of my <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/?ref=zachseward.com">favorite</a> <a href="https://documentedny.com/?ref=zachseward.com">news</a> <a href="https://outliermedia.org/?ref=zachseward.com">startups</a> of the current era have chosen the non-profit path, which has its own major challenges, but at least cynicism is not one of them. Quartz is now a <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Notable-zombie-brands?ref=zachseward.com">zombie brand</a>, which is the most cynical move in media.</p><p>I never wanted to write this piece while good people were still working at Quartz. Now it can be laid to rest.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Knowledge-intensive analytical applications retrieve context from both structured tabular data and unstructured, text-free documents for effective decision-making. Large language models (LLMs) have made it significantly easier to prototype such retrieval and reasoning data pipelines. However, implementing these pipelines efficiently still demands significant effort and has several challenges. This often involves orchestrating heterogeneous data systems, managing data movement, and handling low-level implementation details, e.g., LLM context management.
<br>To address these challenges, we introduce FlockMTL: an extension for DBMSs that deeply integrates LLM capabilities and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). FlockMTL includes model-driven scalar and aggregate functions, enabling chained predictions through tuple-level mappings and reductions. Drawing inspiration from the relational model, FlockMTL incorporates: (i) cost-based optimizations, which seamlessly apply techniques such as batching and caching; and (ii) resource independence, enabled through novel SQL DDL abstractions: PROMPT and MODEL, introduced as first-class schema objects alongside TABLE. FlockMTL streamlines the development of knowledge-intensive analytical applications, and its optimizations ease the implementation burden.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p><span>In the small town of Kawara in Fukuoka Prefecture, something unexpected is happening at the Saidosho Community Center. While kids in most parts of Japan are obsessed with Pokémon cards — or perhaps the franchise’s latest smartphone game, </span><a href="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/entertainment/tech-trends/pokemon-tgc-pocket-continues-to-dominate-the-app-charts/"><span>Pokémon TCG Pocket</span></a><span> — the children of Kawara are clutching to something a little closer to home.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They are playing a trading card game (TCG) where the stars aren’t fantasy creatures, anime heroes or even famous baseball players, but </span><i><span>ojisan</span></i><span> (middle-aged or older men) from the local community of Saidosho.</span></p>

<div id="attachment_265114"><p><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-265114" src="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ojisan-01.jpg" alt="ojisan trading cards " width="2048" height="1356" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-src-img="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ojisan-01.jpg" data-src-webp="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ojisan-01.jpg.webp"></p><p id="caption-attachment-265114">Image: Mayuko Ichii | edits by TW</p></div>
<h2 id="67e2541dad9ce"><span>A Card Game With a Local Twist</span></h2>
<p><span>On the surface, this Ojisan TCG looks like any other collectible card game. As of March 18, there are 47 different cards in the collection, including 28 featuring local men with stats and special abilities.</span></p>
<p><span>Take the Firewall card, for example. It features Mr. Honda (74), a former fire brigade chief who helped keep the town safe for decades. Then there’s Soba Master Mr. Takeshita (81), who runs a local soba noodle-making class and now holds legendary status among the town’s youth.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The most popular of them all is probably All-Rounder Mr. Fujii (68), a former prison officer turned community volunteer. His card is so sought after that local kids have even started asking him for autographs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“I was honestly shocked when they asked me to sign it,” Mr. Fujii said, laughing. “I never imagined I’d become a trading card, let alone have fans.”</span></p>
<p><span>Each card comes with different attacks and an assigned elemental type — just like a classic fantasy card game — but with a humorous, real-world edge. For instance, Firewall is, unsurprisingly, a fire type, equipped with a Super Guard move, which deals a hefty 200 damage.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A card called Plasma Conductor, featuring a smiling, bespectacled ojisan juxtaposed with an image of a lightbulb, is an electric type. At the bottom of the card, there is a line of text explaining how he can fix any electrical appliance without fail.&nbsp;</span></p>
<div id="attachment_265113"><p><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-265113" src="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ojisan-02.jpg" alt="ojisan trading cards " width="2880" height="1614" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-src-img="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ojisan-02.jpg" data-src-webp="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ojisan-02.jpg.webp"></p><p id="caption-attachment-265113">Screenshot taken from FNN Prime Online</p></div>
<h2 id="67e2541dad9e0"><span>From Collecting to Battling&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>The creator of the game is Eri Miyahara, the Secretary General of the Saidosho Community Council.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“We wanted to strengthen the connection between the children and the older generations in the community. There are so many amazing people here. I thought it was such a shame that no one knew about them,” she said in</span><a href="https://www.fnn.jp/articles/-/842101"><span> an interview</span></a><span> with </span><i><span>Fuji News Network</span></i><span> (FNN). “Since the card game went viral, so many kids are starting to look up to these men as heroic figures.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The plan worked. Kids have started attending local events and volunteering for community activities — just for a chance to meet the ojisan from their cards. Participation in town events has reportedly doubled since the game launched.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Interestingly, Ojisan TCG didn’t start as a competitive game. The first set of cards was designed purely for collecting, but the local children quickly turned it into something more dynamic. They began comparing stats and declaring, “My card is stronger than yours.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Seeing this, the game’s creator decided to take it to the next level. New rules were introduced, allowing the cards to be used in actual battles. The objective isn’t to defeat the opponent’s card but to outplay it based on the characters’ skills and abilities.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The rarity of a card isn’t based on fantasy stats — it’s tied to real-world contributions. The more actively the ojisan engages in volunteer work or community service, the higher the chances of their card being upgraded to a shiny version with a glossy laminated effect.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While the cards — all made entirely by hand — are currently in high demand and often out of stock, they are only available for sale at the Saidosho Community Center.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A pack of three cards costs ¥100, while a pack of six cards — including a shiny card — costs ¥500. Despite the limited supply, demand remains high, with many kids saving their pocket money for a chance to score a shiny version of their favorite ojisan.</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody" id="articleBody">
	

<p>A few years ago, a lone programmer named t0st did something extraordinary: he fixed an 8-year-old bug in <em>GTA Online</em> that had been driving players crazy. The bug? Painfully long load times, sometimes up to 20 minutes. While the single-player mode loaded in seconds. His solution was elegant: a 13-line code tweak that cut load times by 70%. Rockstar Games, the studio behind <em>GTA</em>, rewarded him with a $10,000 bounty and patched the game. Problem solved, right? </p>

<p>Not quite.  </p>

<p>The internet erupted with criticism. How could a billion-dollar company miss something so obvious? Were their developers incompetent? As someone who’s worked in tech, I can tell you the answer isn’t that simple. The real story here isn’t about lazy developers or technical incompetence. It’s about how even the simplest fixes get lost in the labyrinth of corporate priorities.  </p>

<p>Let me paint you a picture of what likely happened behind the scenes.  </p>

<h3>The Lifecycle of a Bug</h3>

<p>Imagine this conversation happening at Rockstar (or any big tech company, really):  </p>

<p><strong>Year 1</strong><br>
<em>Dev 1</em>: “Hey, I think we can improve load times by fixing how we parse JSON. It’s a quick win.”<br>
<em>Dev 2</em>: “Sounds good. Create a ticket so we don’t forget.”<br>
<em>Product Manager</em>: “Was this in the requirements? No? Okay, I’ll mark it as tech debt and add it to the backlog.”  </p>

<p><strong>Year 3</strong><br>
<em>Dev 3</em>: “This JSON bottleneck is still here. Should we prioritize the old ticket?”<br>
<em>Product Manager</em>: “We’re focused on the next DLC and microtransactions this quarter. Maybe next year.”  </p>

<p><strong>Year 6</strong><br>
<em>Product Manager</em>: “This ticket’s from 2013. Is it still relevant?”<br>
<em>Dev 35</em>: “No clue. The codebase has been rewritten twice. Probably not. Let’s archive it.”  </p>

<p><strong>Year 8</strong><br>
<em>Dev N</em>: “Hey, I think we can cut load times by fixing how we parse JSON...”  </p>

<p>And so the cycle continues.  </p>

<h3>Why Good Bugs Go Unfixed</h3>

<p>This isn’t just a Rockstar problem. It’s a <em>big company</em> problem. Here’s why even obvious bugs like this one slip through the cracks:  </p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>The Tyranny of “Requirements”</strong><br>
In large organizations, everything revolves around the roadmap. If a bug fix isn’t tied to a specific requirement or feature, it gets labeled as “tech debt” and shoved to the bottom of the backlog. And let’s be honest: “tech debt” is corporate-speak for <em>“we’ll deal with this never.”</em>  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Rotating Door of Ownership</strong><br>
Over eight years, developers and product managers come and go. The person who originally filed the ticket? Long gone. The person who understood the issue? Moved on to another project. Institutional memory fades, and the ticket becomes a relic of the past. Even if the problem is still very much alive.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Myth of “Quick Fixes”</strong><br>
A 13-line patch might seem trivial, but in a legacy codebase, even small changes can have unintended consequences. Without proper tests or documentation, developers are often hesitant to touch old code. The risk of breaking something far outweighs the reward of fixing a non-critical bug.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Invisible ROI</strong><br>
Let’s be real: improving load times doesn’t directly impact the bottom line. Selling Shark Cards (GTA’s virtual currency) does. Companies optimize for metrics that show up on quarterly earnings calls, not for goodwill or user experience, until it’s too late.  </p></li>
</ol>

<h3>The Happy Ending That Changes Nothing</h3>

<p>t0st’s fix was a PR win for Rockstar, but it didn’t solve the underlying issue. For every high-profile bug that gets fixed, thousands languish in backlogs, forgotten and ignored. The real takeaway here isn’t that companies don’t care about bugs. It’s that they’re often paralyzed by competing priorities, bureaucratic inertia, and the cold calculus of profit.  </p>

<p>So the next time you’re staring at a loading screen or cursing a glitch, remember: the enemy isn’t lazy developers. It’s the system that treats user experience as an afterthought. Until an outsider forces its hand.  </p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.littlepolygon.com/posts/scaffold/">https://blog.littlepolygon.com/posts/scaffold/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43615322">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>On the latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3038700/Nightshift_Galaxy/"><em>Nightshift Galaxy</em></a> weekly dev stream I demonstrated the specialized level editting tool I’m building inside the Unreal Level Editor that I’m calling <strong>Scaffold</strong>.</p>

<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RDZPNKNbJYc" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>

<p>I gave an impromptu introduction to my motivations and inspirations live, but on reflection the topic deserves a written deep-dive.</p>
<p>In designing tools I’m guided by three high-level goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Productivity</strong>. As a solo-developer, I need to automate as much of my workflow as possible, to ensure that I focus on places where my specific skill-set adds value, and avoid labor-intensive tasks that aren’t core to gameplay.</li>
<li><strong>Individuality</strong>. A risk of using a generic game engine, like Unreal or Unity, and common marketplace assets is producing a generic game. By developing unique systems, I can enable unique gameplay that has market differentiation.</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>. As an action game with a high skill-ceiling there is no “correctness vs. performance” tradeoff; 60+ FPS is a correctness requirement.  Furthermore, in my experience, to confidently reach a larger audience with midrange commodity devices, one can’t simply chip-away at perf problems in the profiler later – one must architect for it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scaffold</strong> addresses these goals by exposing (i) an interactive interior design tool that prioritizes power-user hotkeys and hackability, (ii) gameplay systems that supplement Unreal’s built-in collision and navigation with opinionated parallel systems, and (iii) data-structures (inspired by 90s game engines) that are efficient by-construction.</p>
<h2 id="background-convex-decomposition">Background: Convex Decomposition

    <a href="#background-convex-decomposition">
        <svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></path></svg>
    </a>
</span>
</h2><p>To explain the details of the system, we need to first establish some background in <strong>Convex Geometry</strong> that’s relevant to the design. In a nutshell, the convex hull property describes any shape where <em>the straight-line connecting any two points within the shape is also contained in the shape</em>.</p>
<p><span>
<p><img src="https://blog.littlepolygon.com/posts/scaffold/convex.jpg" alt="">
<em>Sample Convex Shapes in 2D</em></p>
</span></p><p>This is in contrast to concave shapes that have notches or holes cut out of them.</p>
<p><span>
<p><img src="https://blog.littlepolygon.com/posts/scaffold/concave.jpg" alt="">
<em>Sample Concave Shapes in 2D</em></p>
</span></p><p>Most spatial algorithms in games, particularly raytracing and pathfinding, implicitly rely on the convex-hull property by partitioning complex scenes into a network of connected convex-volumes through a process called <strong>Convex Decomposition</strong>.</p>
<p>In this data-structure, the faces of the volumes fall into two categories: <em>Walls</em> that close the outside of the composed shape, and <em>Windows</em> in-between shared internal edges that are logically open.</p>
<p><span>
<p><img src="https://blog.littlepolygon.com/posts/scaffold/wall_window.jpg" alt="">
<em>Convex Decomposition</em></p>
</span></p><p>To trace a ray through the scene, we start by identifying which volume contains the origin of the ray (ususally from context). Because of the convex-hull property we know we can extend a straight-line all the way to a point on the edge, which we identify through ray-plane intersection. Then we check if the edge is a “wall,” in which case we’ve successful identified the hit, or a “window,” in which case we go back and repeat the process for the newly-entered volume.</p>
<p><span>
<p><img src="https://blog.littlepolygon.com/posts/scaffold/raycast.jpg" alt="">
<em>Raycasting within a Convex Decomposition</em></p>
</span></p><p>This algorithm is <em>local</em> and for volumes with a fixed-capacity for the number of sides has O(1) complexity, relative to the size of the scene, as opposed to a brute-force algorithm which inspects every single wall and therefore has O(n) complexity.</p>
<p>We extend this algorithm to loose-props and moving-actors by associating with each volume a list of primitives, what I call an “object-bucket,” which is searched for a hit before advancing to the far-edge.</p>
<p><span>
<p><img src="https://blog.littlepolygon.com/posts/scaffold/bucket.jpg" alt="">
<em>Raycasting with Loose Object “Buckets”</em></p>
</span></p><p>By assigning a fixed-capacity to buckets, this keeps the cost O(1). When we consider that every actor is doing their own traces to move every frame, that gives us something like O(n) total performance complexity, vs. brute force in which every actor is checking every other actor for O(n²) total performance complexity, which is unacceptable for interactive applications.</p>
<p>If the buckets have variable-capacity, we can avoid the “everyone crowds in one volume” edge-case by recursively subdividing buckets spatially and making a tree-like structure. For a uniform-distribution of actors, this has O(log n) trace complexity and O(n × log n) total complexity, which is the typical threshold in game programming for “fixable via perf profiling.”</p>
<h2 id="navigation">Navigation
<span>
    <a href="#navigation">
        <svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></path></svg>
    </a>
</span>
</h2><p>Another use-case for convex decomposition is <em>pathfinding</em>. By drawing waypoints in the middle of each “window” we know we can connect them across their shared volumes with straight-lines (again, due to the convex hull property). Furthermore, any actor inside a convex-volume can make their way to any of that volume’s waypoints, and as long as a connected path exists we can draw draw a path between any two points that is free of collision.</p>
<p><span>
<p><img src="https://blog.littlepolygon.com/posts/scaffold/nav.jpg" alt="">
<em>Pathfinding on a Convex “Navigation Mesh”</em></p>
</span></p><p>The algorithm to determine the if the path exists is beyond the scope of this writeup, but it’s called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A* Search Algorithm</a> and there’s lots of easily-searchable literature about it online.</p>
<h2 id="collision-and-navigation-in-general-purpose-game-engines">Collision and Navigation in General-Purpose Game Engines
<span>
    <a href="#collision-and-navigation-in-general-purpose-game-engines">
        <svg viewBox="0 0 28 23" height="100%" width="19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71" fill="none" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-miterlimit="10" stroke-width="2"></path></svg>
    </a>
</span>
</h2><p>Mapping these concepts to modern general-purpose game engines, like Unity and Unreal, is tricky due to the architecture of their level editors. Both eschew the explicit construction of spatial geometry, and instead expose to designers a simple list of loose objects that are hand-placed individually (“Actors” in Unreal, “GameObjects” in Unity). Therefore, to apply these algorithms, dynamic data structures are built at run-time with heuristic methods.</p>
<p>For collision and raycasting, the spatial partition is built via an invisible lattice of implicitly-linked convex grid-cells (think like the lattice in Minecraft, except each cell has a object-bucket rather than a solid voxel).</p>
<p><span>
<p><img src="https://blog.littlepolygon.com/posts/scaffold/quadtree.gif" alt="">
<em>Here’s a 2D “Quadtree” illustrated. The convex decomposition is limited to boxes and object-buckets, but no true “walls”.</em></p>
</span></p><p>The origin of the ray is determined via quantization, and proceeds in the same way outlined above, except the grid-cells have only “window” edges, so we’re only collision-checking the buckets. This is described in literature as “Broad-Phase Collision”.</p>
<p><span>
<p><img src="https://blog.littlepolygon.com/posts/scaffold/octree_cast.jpg" alt="">
<em>Tracing a ray through a broadphase spatial partition (greatly simplified).</em></p>
</span></p><p>Because a rectangular grid cell cleanly divides into 8 sub-cells, this lattice data structure is called an “Octree.” Due to its simplicity, Octrees are the most common spatial partitions, but other schemes exist, and the solution in production often has several interesting optimizations that are beyond the scope of this summary – but the principle is the same.</p>
<p>Both Unreal and Unity used to rely on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhysX">PhysX</a> library for this task, though Unreal has transitioned to an in-house solution called <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/physics-in-unreal-engine">Chaos</a>.  Other notable libraries are <a href="https://github.com/jrouwe/JoltPhysics">Jolt</a>, which was originally developed for the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_Zero_Dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>, and <a href="https://www.havok.com/havok-physics/">Havok</a>, which has been around a long time, most notably/recently powering Nintendo’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Breath_of_the_Wild">Breath of the Wild</a>.</p>
<p><span>
<p><img src="https://blog.littlepolygon.com/posts/scaffold/zelda.jpg" alt="">
<em>“I’ll just develop my indie game the same way a multimillion dollar company develops theirs” is not exactly a winning strategy.</em></p>
</span></p><p>For navigation, general-purpose engines rely on hand-placed volumes to perform many continuous raycasts on background threads at runtime to asynchronously populate connected “ground shapes” on which pathfinding can be performed. This process is more art than science, and relies on a vast number of fine-tuning parameters that demand continuous designer tweaking for good results. Unreal, in particular, relies on the <a href="https://github.com/recastnavigation/recastnavigation">Recast</a> library for this task.</p>
<p><span>
<p><img src="https://blog.littlepolygon.com/posts/scaffold/recast.png" alt="">
<em>Screenshot of the Recast Navigation system, from their official Github page.</em></p>
</span></p><p>The downside of these general-purpose dynamic solutions is that the CPU and RAM requirements are higher than precomputed explicit compositions, and they’re more likely to exhibit the variable O(n × log n) complexity that demands laborious perf-tuning. Furthermore, they transfer all the work of constructing the patritions to the end-user’s gaming device, rather than allowing static scene data to be “cooked” ahead of time on developer workstations.</p>

</h2><p>They’re workable in a large-team production setting, but in my case they resist all three of my high-level goals.  Therefore, I began searching for alternatives – not to replace these features whole-cloth, but the supplement them with parallel systems for specific cases where they’re not well-suited.</p>
<p>The fact that in principle they all share a common data structure gave me this feeling that I should be able to make a tool which does “double duty”.</p>
<p>In searching for inspiration I began thinking about mid-90s shooters, which accomplished a lot of what I want on <em>very</em> modest low-power commodity PCs, in particular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)">DOOM (1993)</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_(video_game)">DESCENT (1995)</a>.</p>

<p><em>Playthrough of DOOM, developed by id Software in 1993</em></p>
</span></p><p>Loose objects like demons and bullets are pretty sparse in the original DOOM, with wall-collision accounting for most of the runtime complexity. The DOOM level editor allows for mostly arbitrary placement of walls, but then runs a special decomposition algorithm to break it down into explicit convex-regions called <em>Binary Space Partitioning</em> (BSP).</p>
<p><span>
<p><img src="https://blog.littlepolygon.com/posts/scaffold/deu.png" alt="">
<em>Screenshot of the origin DOOM level editor.</em></p>
</span></p><p>The idea is to pick a wall at random, and subdivide the remaining walls into those that are in-front or behind that wall’s plane (splitting walls that straddle the plane). For those two subsets you rinse-and repeat until you’ve exhausted all the walls, and what remains at the leaf-nodes of the subdivision is a convex partition of the scene, which can be computed and stored ahead-of-time with level-data.</p>
<p><span>
<p><img src="https://blog.littlepolygon.com/posts/scaffold/bsp_source.gif" alt="">
<em>Diagram from Valve’s Source Engine documentation demonstrating convex-decomposition via Binary Space Partitioning.</em></p>
</span></p><p>The original DOOM simplified these BSPs by imposing the restriction that all walls are perfectly vertical, so the partitioning could be mostly 2D, though later versions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game)">Quake</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Tournament">Unreal Tournament</a> used the same technique with sloped geometry, too.</p>
<p>While it’s interesting to study to understand the history of how broad-phase collision developed historically, I didn’t really feel like there was much for me to exploit</p>

</h2><p>Another interesting case I looked at was Descent, which billed itself as the first “full 3D” shooter with complex volume-filling geometry, as opposed to being mostly-flattened onto the horizontal plane like DOOM.</p>
<p><span>

</p>
<p><em>Playthrough of Descent, developed by Interplay in 1995</em></p>
</span></p><p>I better appreciated for how they implemented this by playing around with the mod community’s level editor <a href="https://descent2.de/dle-frames.html">DLE</a>, where levels are built-up from convex “segments” that are each six-sided cuboid hexahedrons. At first glance this seems like a restrictive limitation which would give rise to rectangular chambers, but creative linking across edges and corners can actually give rise to pretty much any shape you want with enough creativity. Additionally, restricting faces to all be quads simplifies how textures and materials are applied, as opposed to having to account for weird triangular topology.</p>

<em>Screenshot of the Descent Level Editor. It looks like a mesh editor at first glance, but you’re actually editting linked cuboid “segments.”</em></p>
</span></p><p>In 2018 the original original devs reconvened to develop a spiritual successor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overload_(video_game)">Overload</a>, with a community <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/884970/Overload_Level_Editor/">level-editor</a> and tutorial series which expands on the same ideas in thoughtful ways. What caught my eye was how they extended the idea of “applying materials” to quad-faces to assembling kit-pieces which have a modern, rather than low-poly, look. For example, rock faces have rough geometry that fill-in crevices to give those areas an organic look.</p>

</p>
<p><em>First Video in a Tutorial Series on the Overload Level Editor</em></p>
</span></p><p>Playing with these tools was a big <em>aha</em> moment for me – that by building-up from convex volumes directly there’s no need to do any kind of “decomposition” like BSPs because the space is partitioned <em>by-construction</em>.</p>
<p>I decided to use this as a starting-point and then go in my own direction.</p>

</h2><p>Instead of building a completely separate application like the Overload team did, I opted to build inside the Unreal Level Editor.</p>
<p>This is a tradeoff – on the one hand it limits the ease of offering modding tools to the community, which is something on my mind. On the other hand, it significantly reduces how much I need to code (since the application-framework/asset-handling/undo-systems are already in place), and let me focus on my value-adds, as opposed to re-implementing all the other loose-object handling that Unreal already does perfectly-fine.</p>

<p><span>
<p><em>Early Sneak-Peak of Scaffold running inside the Unreal Level Editor.</em></p>
</span></p><p>I won’t go into all the boring details, suffice to say for Unreal-heads out there I started with the <strong>SplineComponentVisualizer</strong> as a reference and built my own tools from there. It took about a week to get to MVP from about 2500ish lines of code. I have all the basic operations - selection modes for vertices, edges, faces, and “cubs” (my name for convex segments – short for “cubby hole”), basic extrude and bridge options, as well as “stamps” for common shapes like cubes, rings, and cylinders.</p>
<p>For the grey “blockout” walls, I’m using the <strong>DynamicMesh</strong> object from the <strong>GeometryScripting</strong> extension (though I intend to replace them with instanced decoration kit meshes), and to create “real collision” trigger volumes for each cub I added a <strong>CubComponent</strong> subtype of <strong>PrimitiveComponent</strong> by referencing the implementationd of <strong>ShapeComponent</strong> and <strong>BoxComponent</strong>.</p>
<p>I wrote a “scaffold raytracing” test which, even in it’s simple quick &amp; dirty implementation, is several orders of magnitude faster than doing ordinary raytraces with Chaos. It’s not something I would use for player bullets or general-purpose traces, but for specialized batches, like enemy bullet-hell patterns, it opens up many opportunities.</p>
<blockquote>— Max! (@xewlupus) <a href="https://twitter.com/xewlupus/status/1895887457734062506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 1, 2025</a></blockquote>



<p><span>
<p><em>Footage from an earlier bullet-hell experimentation stream.</em></p>
</span></p><p>But the real <em>coup de grâce</em> for me was that, as I expected, Scaffold data also works as a navigation system!  I generate a waypoint for each shared cub-face, and do a quick check to see if the “floor” of the cub is a wall-or-window, and quickly generate a navigation graph that works for both ground-units and aerial units with no extra labor.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Update from yesterday's stream -- the Scaffold level editor is now generating nav-data for AI-pathfinding in addition to blockout wall collision. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/screenshotsaturday?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#screenshotsaturday</a> <a href="https://t.co/qaUStE3V1j">pic.twitter.com/qaUStE3V1j</a></p>— Max!

<p><span>
<p><em>First test of Aerial Navigation working inside Scaffold.</em></p>
</span></p><p>At this point I’m confident in the direction of the solution, so now I’m fleshing out missing features, and adding more “smart” operations so I can lay-out spaces faster. The big difference between Nightshift and Descent is that I want to exit Spaceships/Asteroid-Bases/Sewer-Tunnels/Caves/Industrial-Interiors and fly around the outside, too, so I’ll need to start thinking about an “exterior hull” toolset as well.</p>

<p><span>One evening</span> in March 2017, Hoan Ton-That, an Australian coder building a powerful facial recognition system, emailed his American business partners with a plan to deploy their fledgling technology. “Border patrol pitch,” the subject line read. He hoped to persuade the federal government to integrate their product with border surveillance cameras so that their newly formed company, later named Clearview AI, could use “face detection” on immigrants entering the United States.</p>



<p>An immigrant to the United States himself, Ton-That grew up in Melbourne and Canberra and claimed to be descended from Vietnamese royalty. At 19, he dropped out of college and, in 2007, moved to San Francisco to pursue a tech career. He later fell in with Silicon Valley neoreactionaries who embraced a far-right, technocratic vision of society. Now Ton-That and his partners wanted to use facial recognition to keep people out of the country. Certain people. Their technology would put that ideology into action.</p>



<p>Clearview had compiled a massive biometric database that would eventually contain <a href="https://www.clearview.ai/post/how-we-store-and-search-30-billion-faces">billions</a> of images the company scraped off the internet and social media without the knowledge of the platforms or their users. Its AI analyzed these images, creating a “faceprint” for every individual. The company let users run a “probe photo” against its database, and if it generated a hit, it displayed the matching images and links to the websites where they originated. This made it easy for Clearview users to further profile their targets with other information found on those webpages: religious or political affiliation, family and friends, romantic partners, sexuality. All without a search warrant or probable cause.</p>



<p>A diehard Donald Trump supporter, Ton-That envisioned using facial recognition to compare images of migrants crossing the border to mugshots to see if the arrivals had been previously arrested in the United States. His Border Patrol pitch also included a proposal to screen any arrival for “sentiment about the USA.” Here, Ton-That appeared to conflate support for the Republican leader with American identity, proposing to scan migrants’ social media for “posts saying ‘I hate Trump’ or ‘Trump is a puta’” and targeting anyone with an “affinity for far-left groups.” The lone example he offered was the National Council of La Raza, now called <a href="https://unidosus.org/about/">UnidosUS</a>, one of the country’s largest Hispanic civil rights organizations.</p>



<p>By the end of Trump’s first presidential term, Clearview had secured funding from right-wing billionaire Peter Thiel, one of Elon Musk’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1103415/000091205701533855/a2059025zs-1.htm">earliest business partners</a>, and signed up hundreds of law enforcement clients around the country. The company doled out free trials to hook users, urging cops to “run wild” with searches. They did. Many departments then bought licenses to access Clearview’s faceprint database.</p>



<p>Since Clearview’s existence first came to light in 2020, the secretive company has attracted outsize controversy for its dystopian privacy implications. Corporations like Macy’s allegedly used Clearview on shoppers, according to <a href="https://casetext.com/case/in-re-clearview-ai-inc-1">legal records</a>; law enforcement has deployed it against activists and protesters; and multiple government investigations have found federal agencies’ use of the product failed to comply with privacy requirements. Many local and state law enforcement agencies now rely on Clearview as a tool in everyday policing, with almost no transparency about how they use the tech. “What Clearview does is mass surveillance, and it is illegal,” the privacy commissioner of Canada <a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/opc-news/news-and-announcements/2021/nr-c_210203/">said</a> in 2021. In 2022, the ACLU <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/aclu-v-clearview-settlement.pdf">settled</a> a lawsuit with Clearview for allegedly violating an <a href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs3.asp?ActID=3004">Illinois state law</a> that prohibits unauthorized biometric harvesting. Data protection authorities in <a href="https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/national-news/2022/french-sa-fines-clearview-ai-eur-20-million_en">France</a>, <a href="https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/national-news/2022/hellenic-dpa-fines-clearview-ai-20-million-euros_en">Greece</a>, <a href="https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/national-news/2022/facial-recognition-italian-sa-fines-clearview-ai-eur-20-million_en">Italy</a>, and <a href="https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/national-news/2024/dutch-supervisory-authority-imposes-fine-clearview-because-illegal-data_en">the Netherlands</a> have also ruled that the company’s data collection practices are illegal. To date, they have fined Clearview around $100 million.</p>



<p>Clearview’s business model is based on “weaponizing our own images against us without a license, without consent, without permission,” says Albert Fox Cahn, executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project.</p>



<p>In December, Ton-That, the face of Clearview since it was forced from the shadows, quietly stepped down as CEO and took on the role of president. In February, he abruptly resigned his new position, though he retains a board seat. When <em>Mother Jones</em> wrote Ton-That, who is now the chief technology officer at Architect Capital, a San Francisco-based investment firm, with questions for this story, he replied: “There are inaccuracies and errors contained in these assertions. They do not merif [<em>sic</em>] further response.” Ton-That refused to elaborate. Clearview declined to comment.</p>



<p>Replacing him as co-CEOs were Richard Schwartz, a co-founder of the company and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/01/nyregion/schwartz-senior-giuliani-aide-is-planning-to-resign-from-post.html">former top aide</a> to Rudy Giuliani, and Hal Lambert, an early Clearview investor who runs a <a href="https://www.pointbridgecapital.com/about/">Texas financial firm</a> known for its “<a href="https://www.pointbridgecapital.com/etf/">MAGA ETF</a>”—an exchange-traded fund that screens companies for their political contributions and buys into those that vigorously back Republicans. A top Trump fundraiser who served on the president’s 2016 inaugural committee, Lambert told <em><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2025/02/19/clearview-ai-ceo-resigns/">Forbes</a> </em>in February that he planned to help the company pursue “opportunities” with the new administration, citing Trump’s mass-­deportation agenda and anti-immigration policies.</p>



<p>Clearview is already well positioned to capitalize on Trump’s xenophobic plans. Today, one of the company’s top <a href="https://www.fpds.gov/ezsearch/fpdsportal?q=clearview+ai+UEI_NAME%3A%22CLEARVIEW+AI%2C+INC.%22&amp;s=FPDS.GOV&amp;templateName=1.5.3&amp;indexName=awardfull&amp;x=19&amp;y=5&amp;sortBy=SIGNED_DATE&amp;desc=Y">customers</a> is US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a relationship cemented during Joe Biden’s presidency, as the agency inked bigger deals with the startup. Under the Biden administration, <a href="https://epic.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/EPIC-20-03-06-ICE-FOIA-20231109-16th-Interim-Production.pdf">ICE records</a> show, the agency deployed Clearview widely, even as officials there charged with monitoring the technology were in the dark about how it was being used and by whom. As the agency executes Trump’s emboldened mission—“Border Czar” Tom Homan has <a href="https://www.instagram.com/donaldjtrumpjr/reel/DCZY-FbuT4K/?hl=en">vowed</a> to unleash “shock and awe” against undocumented immigrants—the dragnet surveillance outlined by Ton-That during the company’s earliest years may already be underway. (ICE did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>



<p>During Biden’s presidency, the trappings of oversight still existed. But Trump has fired many of the inspectors general who review the use of technology such as Clearview and guard against abuse. And Trump’s early actions have shown his administration has little regard for the legal, congressional, and constitutional guardrails that have constrained his predecessors.</p>



<p>Immigrants aren’t the only people at risk. With Trump pursuing “<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6355810503112">retribution</a>” against his political enemies, Clearview offers a range of frightening applications. “It creates a really disturbingly powerful tool for police that can identify nearly every person at a protest or a reproductive health facility or a house of worship with just photos of those people’s faces,” says Cahn.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.usccr.gov/files/2024-09/civil-rights-implications-of-frt_0.pdf">No federal laws</a> regulate facial recognition, and many federal agencies have deployed Clearview for years with little accountability. Consider that the FBI—now run by Kash Patel, who has <a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/epochtv/kashs-corner-what-did-the-fbi-know-before-jan-6-4885960">claimed</a> FBI agents incited January 6, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thetnholler/reel/DCH5fNGSjQS/?locale">pledged</a> to target journalists, and <a href="https://www.horizonbooks.com/book/9781637588246">penned</a> a book containing the names of officials he planned to settle scores with—is another major federal customer. Patel’s new deputy director, Dan Bongino, is a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/dan-bongino-fbi-deputy-director-infowars/">conspiratorial</a> right-wing influencer who has used <a href="https://x.com/dbongino/status/1796295943307788693">violent rhetoric</a> about liberals and called for <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/03/nx-s1-5308020/dan-bongino-trump-fbi-director-conspiracies-podcast" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/03/nx-s1-5308020/dan-bongino-trump-fbi-director-conspiracies-podcast">jailing</a> Democrats. (The FBI declined to comment on its use of Clearview or on Bongino’s extremist views.)</p>



<p>I’ve reported on Clearview for years. This story, based on interviews with insiders and thousands of newly obtained emails, texts, and other records, including internal ICE communications, provides the fullest account to date of the extent of the company’s far-right origins and of the implementation of its facial recognition technology within the federal government’s immigration enforcement apparatus. It reveals how Ton-That, who obsessed over race, IQ, and hierarchy, solicited input from eugenicists and right-wing extremists while building Clearview, and how, from the outset, he and his associates discussed deploying the tech against immigrants, people of color, and the political left. All told, this new reporting paints a chilling portrait of an ideologically driven company whose powerful surveillance technology is now in the hands of the Trump administration, as it bulldozes democratic institutions and executes an authoritarian takeover.</p>

<p><span>Ton-That knows</span> better than most how a picture posted online can come back to haunt you. As Clearview took off, he was confronted with a snapshot from his past that clashed with his effort to present himself and his company as apolitical. It showed him partying on election night in 2016 with far-right activists in MAGA hats. One fellow reveler, Charles “Chuck” Johnson, a political agitator with wide-ranging connections to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/07/jd-vance-charles-johnson-texts/">Republican politicians</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdrange/2016/06/15/what-happened-to-internet-troll-chuck-johnsons-lawsuit-against-gawker/">right-wing billionaires</a>, was also Ton-That’s business partner. Smartcheckr, the company they founded with Schwartz, would later relaunch as Clearview.</p>



<p>In early 2021, Ton-That <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/18/magazine/facial-recognition-clearview-ai.html">told</a> the<em> New York Times</em>’<em> </em>Kashmir Hill that his extreme views and associations were confined to a brief period in his life when he was “confused.” He offered a similar explanation a few months later when a documentary crew from <em>France 24</em> asked him about his far-right ties. “I’m not a political person,” he <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/reporters/20230602-your-face-is-ours-the-dangers-of-facial-recognition-software">said</a>. “It’s wrong to assume my political beliefs just from a photo…That was a different time in 2016, a long time ago.”</p>



<p>But Ton-That’s path to radicalization began earlier than he let on, and his extremism was no fleeting dalliance. By 2015, he was interacting online with alt-right activists, including Milo Yiannopoulos and Mike Cernovich. Deleted social media posts also show him chatting with extremists such as Andrew “weev” Auernheimer, the longtime <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/resources/extremist-files/andrew-weev-auernheimer/">webmaster</a> of the<em> Daily Stormer</em>, a neo-Nazi website. (Auernheimer, who has a large <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190902194133/https://dailystormer.name/what-i-learned-from-my-time-in-prison/">swastika tattoo</a> and has repeatedly called for a genocide of Jews, denied to <em>Mother Jones</em> that he holds neo-Nazi views and claimed he was no longer involved with the<em> Daily Stormer</em>. He also said he never interacted with Ton-That but declined to address evidence of their communications.)</p>

<p>By early 2016, Ton-That described himself as a lifelong libertarian who’d shifted further right over time. Along the way, he discovered the “<a href="https://www.populismstudies.org/Vocabulary/dark-enlightenment/">Dark Enlightenment</a>” neoreactionary movement, a fascist outgrowth of Silicon Valley’s radical libertarianism. He read the work of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050312085549/http://www.isteve.com/">Steve Sailer</a>, a longtime contributor to white nationalist publications and a proponent of “human biodiversity,” a racist pseudoscience favored by neoreactionaries. Like white nationalists, neoreactionaries reject egalitarianism and view America as weakened by feminism and diversity initiatives. But they make room within their elitist hierarchy for Jewish, Asian, and gay men—demographics, conveniently, common in Silicon Valley’s leadership class. Neoreactionaries consider themselves a high-IQ natural aristocracy and long for a corporatist strongman—a CEO monarch—to usher in what Thiel calls a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/fashion/peter-thiel-donald-trump-silicon-valley-technology-gawker.html">futuristic</a>” version of the past, one in which technocrats rule as an ennobled caste. They view technology as the engine to remake society on their terms, an ambition that Thiel has never disguised.</p>



<p>“We were going to use technology to change the whole world to overturn the monetary system,” Thiel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgH7Lv2gQdk">said</a> in 2010, explaining the impetus for PayPal, the e-payment company he co-founded with Musk. “The basic idea was that we could never win an election…because we were in such a small minority. But maybe you could actually unilaterally change the world—without having to constantly convince people and beg people and plead with people who were never going to agree with you—through a technological means.” (Thiel did not respond to questions.)</p>



<p>As Ton-That radicalized, he grew friendly with Curtis Yarvin, an intellectual muse to <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/04/inside-the-new-right-where-peter-thiel-is-placing-his-biggest-bets?srsltid=AfmBOorhA7uJBAdn60ck0UteM7_yRJxq6k4nmjAEWb64MAAzpxpPRspX">Thiel</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/PMq1ZEcyztY">Vice President JD Vance</a>, and other prominent right-wingers. Ton-That thought Yarvin was “brilliant” and spoke often and admiringly of “Curtis,” one source told me. The godfather of neoreaction in America, Yarvin (who did not respond to questions) <a href="https://www.unqualified-reservations.org/2008/07/olxiv-rules-for-reactionaries/">believes</a> democracy is a “dangerous, malignant form of government” and has argued for a soft coup and a purge of civil servants in favor of political loyalists. This “<a href="https://graymirror.substack.com/p/the-butterfly-revolution">butterfly revolution</a>,” as Yarvin called it in 2022, looks eerily similar to Trump and Musk’s blitzkrieg against the federal bureaucracy.</p>



<p>Neoreaction also led Ton-That to Johnson, a Thiel confidant who ran a far-right site called <em><a href="https://www.splcenter.org/resources/hate-watch/once-outlet-conspiracies-gotnewscom-now-shuttered-without-explanation/">GotNews</a></em> that published dirt on Black victims of police violence and Black Lives Matter protesters. “Am a reader of yours, like your work,” Ton-That wrote Johnson in May 2016, asking to be added to a Slack group Johnson had set up around a different project he had launched, ­WeSearchr, a crowdfunding platform that raised money for neo-Nazis and far-right causes. The Slack group was an online watering hole for a likeminded crowd, according to Peter Duke, another business partner of Johnson’s at the time who participated in the chat and who described it to <em>France 24</em> in unaired footage.</p>



<p>“When you get to a point where you understand that democracy is fake, then you have to&nbsp;think about different frameworks for the way that people are gonna be ruled,” he said. “What we all had in common when we met was that we thought that neoreactionaryism was an interesting idea…The United States of America was founded on the idea that all men are created equal. And Curtis simply asked a question, as I remember it: ‘What if they’re not? What do you do?…How do you govern that?’…That’s what we talked about all the time.” (Duke declined to answer questions.)</p>

<p>Ton-That and Johnson quickly bonded. They brainstormed “alt-tech” ideas and a few months later, in early 2017, launched Smartcheckr, Clearview’s predecessor. Ton-That also got to know Duke and other radicals associated with Johnson, including Marko Jukic, a self-described extremist Catholic traditionalist who once argued that diversity is “<a href="https://yuray1.rssing.com/chan-64766770/all_p1.html">corrosive to civilization</a>”; Tyler Bass, a white nationalist who, according to his former girlfriend, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-alt-right_n_5e7d028bc5b6cb08a92a5c48">attended</a> the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia; and far-right influencer Douglass Mackey, who used a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/social-media-influencer-sentenced-election-interference-2016-presidential-race">pseudonymous</a> social media persona to disseminate Nazi propaganda and advocate for “global white supremacy.” (Jukic told <em>Mother Jones that he now considers himself a centrist and that</em> his neoreactionary writings were “exercises in theatrical hyperbole and comedic satire.” Bass did not respond to a request for comment. Mackey said he identifies today as a “moderately conservative Republican” and previously promoted white supremacy “mostly for shock and trolling.”)</p>



<p>Jukic, Bass, and Mackey would all go on to work for the facial recognition startup in some capacity. Jukic pitched Clearview to potential law enforcement customers. Bass oversaw a project with a real estate firm whose CEO was considering investing and wanted to test the tech, which the team piloted using a surveillance camera in the lobby of an apartment building to secretly harvest images of tenants and visitors. Mackey, who was later <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/social-media-influencer-douglass-mackey-convicted-election-interference-2016">convicted</a> of federal election interference for trying to dupe women and people of color into voting by text, did contract work for Clearview’s predecessor firm and briefly handled outreach to political clients interested in using what company promotional material characterized as “unconventional databases” for “extreme opposition research.” In 2020, while <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-alt-right_n_5e7d028bc5b6cb08a92a5c48">reporting</a> on Clearview for <em>HuffPost</em>, I contacted the company to ask about Jukic and Bass’ roles. Clearview parted ways with both soon after.</p>



<p>Ton-That sought to recruit other extremists, too. He wrote in a November 2016 email that he wanted to “totally hire” Emil Kirkegaard, a Danish eugenicist who had scraped OkCupid and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/5/12/11666116/70000-okcupid-users-data-release">published</a> the data of nearly 70,000 users. Kirkegaard, who did not respond to questions, had infamously <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131010082010/https:/emilkirkegaard.dk/en/?p=3229">advocated</a> to legalize child porn and lower the age of consent to 13 or the onset of puberty.</p>



<p>Ton-That called him a “total talent.” Emails show the CEO bounced facial recognition ideas off Kirkegaard, hoping to figure out how to identify gay people, or even predict criminality, from facial features.</p>



<p>Ton-That was fascinated by eugenics and admired the field’s founder, Francis Galton, who inspired Nazi “<a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/eugenics">racial hygiene</a>” programs. After digesting a <a href="https://galton.org/letters/africa-for-chinese/AfricaForTheChinese.htm">letter</a> by Galton that argued for Chinese immigrants to move to Africa and supplant the “inferior” Black race, Ton-That declared in an email that Galton was a “true prophet.” Among friends, he spoke often about IQ and race, wondering aloud about the intellectual superiority of half-Asian, half-white people like himself. He also consulted with Michigan State University physics professor <a href="https://directory.natsci.msu.edu/directory/Profiles/Person/102190">Steve Hsu</a>, a human biodiversity devotee who <a href="https://infoproc.blogspot.com/2019/05/manifold-episode-10-ron-unz-on-subprime.html">associates</a> with <a href="https://www.unz.com/runz/american-pravda-holocaust-denial/">Holocaust deniers</a> and has spent years <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/05/29/wake-controversy-over-harvard-dissertation-race-and-iq-scrutiny-michigan-state">researching</a> genetic differences among populations. In a 2017 email, Ton-That thanked Hsu (who did not respond to questions) for his work to “reverse dysgenic trends.”</p>



<p>Emails from the time show Ton-That reading and sharing articles from far-right publications such as <em><a href="https://www.splcenter.org/resources/extremist-files/greg-johnson/">Counter-Currents</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.splcenter.org/resources/extremist-files/vdare/">VDARE</a></em>, and <em>Unz Review</em> as he collaborated and socialized with a range of extremists and pro-Trump authoritarians. At an October 2016 <a href="https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/bathing-in-pigs-blood-inside-the-alt-rights-pro-trump-art-show">event</a> co-organized by future Stop the Steal leader Ali Alexander, Ton-That partied with Islamophobe Laura Loomer, right-wing sting artist James O’Keefe, and Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes, who initiated new members into his gang as Ton-That watched. Ton-That huddled at this event with Jeff Giesea, a <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/josephbernstein/this-man-helped-build-the-trump-meme-army-and-now-he-wants-t">Thiel lieutenant</a> who helped the tech investor vet candidates for the first Trump administration. This was the far-right elite.</p>







<p>In a June 2017 email to Thiel seeking seed funding, Ton-That reported that he and his partners had landed their first facial recognition client: JPMorgan Chase. “We helped their security team vet each person attending their shareholders meeting to make sure there were no protestors,” Ton-That wrote. (JPMorgan denied using Smartcheckr.) But even as the company attempted to make inroads in the corporate world, its founders remained active in extremist circles. The same evening as the JPMorgan shareholders meeting, Johnson asked Ton-That to tackle another assignment. A technical error had fouled up a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170601053046/http:/www.wesearchr.com/bounties/daily-stormer-vs-splc-legal-defense-fund">campaign</a> on Johnson’s WeSearchr crowdfunding platform set up by the <em>Daily Stormer</em>’s Auernheimer to raise money for Andrew Anglin, the neo-Nazi site’s editor, who’d been <a href="https://casetext.com/case/gersh-v-anglin-3">sued</a> for waging a harassment and intimidation campaign against a Jewish woman. Ton-That seemingly fixed the problem. Auernheimer and Anglin ultimately raised more than $150,000.</p>



<p>For at least the next year, Ton-That moonlighted as tech support for Johnson’s sites, sometimes helping extremists make and move money, usually cryptocurrency. When a co-founder of Johnson’s crowdfunding venture quit and left the team without a way to access the bitcoin they’d collected, Ton-That recovered the cryptocurrency, worth more than $150,000 at the time. Underscoring how vital Ton-That was to their operation, Duke wrote in a 2018 email, “Hoan is the only resource that has complete access and understanding of WeSearchr.”</p>

<p><span>As they grew</span> their facial recognition company, Ton-That, Johnson, and Schwartz brought in investors such as Thiel and Naval Ravikant, an Indian-born technocrat who had encouraged Ton-That to move to the United States and became his first Silicon Valley mentor. Ravikant, who did not respond to questions, imagined a neofeudalist future of “<a href="https://x.com/naval/status/1084724006626840576">small free cities with drone armies and skill-based immigration policies</a>” and a “<a href="https://x.com/naval/status/1084727967916339203">one bitcoin, one vote</a>” system of government.</p>



<p>Another early backer was Hal Lambert, a former finance chair for the Texas GOP who runs Point Bridge Capital, the investment firm behind the MAGA ETF. Lambert, who served on Clearview’s board before becoming co-CEO with Schwartz, harbored his own fringe views. He claimed the George Floyd protests had turned into “<a href="https://x.com/MAGAindex/status/1266752685711253505">George Soros funded riots</a>” on social media and passed around a screed about how Floyd died from drug-induced “cardiopulmonary arrest,” rather than the knee of a cop on his neck. Like his business partners, Lambert wanted to deploy facial recognition to support a conservative agenda. In September 2017, after reading a <em><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2017/09/07/exclusive-kobach-out-of-state-voters-changed-outcome-new-hampshire-senate-race/">Breitbart</a></em> article that suggested out-of-state Democrats had flipped a close 2016 Senate race in New Hampshire, he emailed Johnson and Ton-That, urging them to use the tech to “identify exactly who the 5,000+ out of state fraud voters are.”</p>



<p>Conspiratorial ideas like these found traction within the company, where the founders exchanged emails indicating their belief that Democrats were cheating in other races around the country. They also appeared to buy into lies about antifascist activists spread by right-wing propagandists who conflate “antifa” with Black Lives Matter and other liberal protesters.</p>



<p>Paranoia about the “radical left” seemed to infuse their business decisions. As part of their plan to use facial recognition in apartment lobbies, they intended to scan the faces of tenants and compare them to mugshots. But Ton-That noted in an email that he also wanted to run them through “any criminal database we have (antifa)” or to see if they were “friends with criminals.” He assumed a link between leftist politics and criminality. “I think every real estate firm will sign up,” he told his co-founders. “Especially ones in diverse areas.” Schwartz, a 67-year-old New Yorker who ran Giuliani’s welfare reform program, which invasively profiled needy people and <a href="https://www.nycbar.org/reports/welfare-reform-in-new-york-city-the-measure-of-success/">deprived</a> them of assistance, loved the idea. “Quite Brilliant!” he replied. After Rudin Management, one of New York City’s largest real estate companies, signed on, the team reportedly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/clearview-source-code-lapse/">collected</a> about 70,000 videos from a lobby surveillance camera. “We beta tested their product for a brief period at one of our buildings nearly a decade ago,” a Rudin spokesperson said. “We chose not to deploy their software at the conclusion of that pilot.”</p>



<p>During Trump’s first term, Clearview made little distinction between bad actors and people exercising their First Amendment rights. Pitch decks the company sent to potential investors and customers, including scores of local law enforcement agencies, touted Clearview’s ability to surveil protesters and target people involved in “radical political or religious activities.” A pitch deck from April 2019 showed how Clearview grouped photos in its faceprint database, including a category it called “Protesters &amp; Agitators.”</p>



<p>In July 2019, Johnson reached out to <a href="https://globalextremism.org/post/harmeet-dhillon/">right-wing</a> attorney Harmeet Dhillon, a Trump lawyer and Republican National Committee official. Dhillon was also representing Andy Ngo, a social media commentator who has made a career out of <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/andy-ngo-right-wing-troll-antifa-877914/">stoking fear</a> about the “radical left” and who was preparing to <a href="https://libertycenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/06042020_Ngo_Complaint_FINAL-1.pdf">sue</a> several people who he alleged assaulted him at protests in Portland, Oregon. Ngo claimed they were antifascists. Dhillon, an election truther and anti-transgender activist whom Trump <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/trump-taps-his-lawyer-dhillon-to-lead-doj-civil-rights-division">tapped</a> to run the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, wanted to hunt them down. “Richard and Hoan can give you a copy of ClearView to help identify antifa,” Johnson told her.</p>



<p>“Thank you!” replied Dhillon, who said she would “send in a batch” of photos. (She did not respond to questions.)</p>



<p>Journalists were another target. In May 2017, Bass emailed Cassandra Fairbanks, a <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a9653830/cassandra-fairbanks-donald-trump-deplorable/">far-right activist</a> whom the first Trump administration <a href="https://casetext.com/case/fairbanks-v-roller">allowed</a> into press briefings, to ask for the names and emails of reporters in the White House press pool. This would potentially enable Ton-That and his partners to surface social media accounts, pull photos, and, as Bass put it, investigate the “leanings” of the journalists. Fairbanks quickly sent the names and emails of eight reporters to Bass, who forwarded the details to Ton-That. “These shills are high-priority,” Bass wrote. “Dope this is going into smartcheckr,” Ton-That replied. The company later created a “Politicians – Academics – Journalists” category in its biometric database.</p>



<p>Smartcheckr and later Clearview shunned public attention. Clearview’s website was blank for a year. Eventually, it displayed a fake address and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191205141417/https://clearview.ai/">cryptic tagline</a>: “Artificial Intelligence for a better world.” Ton-That and Schwartz cautioned people using the tech to keep Clearview secret. They and Johnson preferred to hawk their product to their political network. They offered Clearview to <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/resources/extremist-files/robert-spencer/">anti-Muslim activist</a> Robert Spencer and gave access to Sean Fieler, an anti-trans, <a href="https://truthout.org/articles/this-anti-abortion-billionaire-is-trying-to-manipulate-the-election-for-the-gop/">right-wing</a> Catholic hedge fund manager. They courted the family office of Shafik Gabr, a tycoon close to Egyptian dictator <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/08/donald-trump-abdel-fattah-al-sisi-egypt-226579/">Abdel Fattah el-Sisi</a>, and solicited venture capital in Beijing. They approached William Je, the financial adviser to <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/05/steve-bannon-isnt-on-trial-but-he-keeps-coming-up-in-a-maga-moguls-fraud-case/">Steve Bannon ally</a> Guo Wengui, who was <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/07/miles-guo-wengui-verdict-guilty/">found guilty</a> alongside Guo last year in a sprawling <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/ho-wan-kwok-aka-miles-guo-arrested-orchestrating-over-1-billion-dollar-fraud-conspiracy">$1 billion fraud case</a>.</p>



<p>While one former Clearview employee said the company tried to expand its potential customer base by courting “anyone they met,” including Democrats and progressives, the firm found few takers outside of the founders’ MAGA milieu. The Clearview team’s connections reached deep into Trump’s inner circle. They reportedly set up a <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolinehaskins1/clearview-ai-john-ratcliffe-dni-trump-facial-recognition">free account</a> for Rep. John Ratcliffe, now the CIA director. And Johnson met with Wilbur Ross, Trump’s first-term commerce secretary, and discussed facial recognition. The Clearview partners also pitched the Republican Attorneys General Association and the right-wing Club for Growth, offering its chairman what Ton-That described as “a motherlode of information that can help with oppo-research.”</p>



<p>During this stealth phase of its existence, Clearview’s most fruitful relationship was with the NYPD, thanks largely to Schwartz’s high-level connections, including to former NYPD Commissioner William Bratton, an instrumental figure in the post-9/11 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/16/nyregion/police-unit-that-spied-on-muslims-is-disbanded.html?smid=tw-bna">expansion</a> of police surveillance programs. Emails show that Ton-That planned a meeting with Bratton for August 2018. The NYPD began trialing Clearview shortly afterward. Although the department never signed a formal contract with Clearview, NYPD employees evangelized the tech throughout the law enforcement community.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“The company emphasizes the use within human trafficking and drug trafficking, but it’s highly unlikely that they would not be actively supporting deportation.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Johnson, Ton-That, and Schwartz each owned a third of what was then still called Smartcheckr. But Johnson’s outré behavior—including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/01/state-of-the-union-matt-gaetz-charles-johnson">publicly denying</a> the Holocaust—had become a liability to his partners, who also contended that he wasn’t pulling his weight in their venture. In 2018, they formed a new company, Clearview, that initially excluded Johnson from ownership, according to court records. “I went from being a third owner of the company to being, like, written out of it entirely,” Johnson said in response to questions from <em>Mother Jones</em>. “And I said, ‘Well, I will just sue you guys.’” Eventually, Ton-That and Schwartz gave Johnson a 10 percent stake in the new company in exchange for his signing a November 2018 “wind-down and transfer agreement” that recognized his “good and valuable advisory services” but also required him to keep his mouth shut about his new ownership stake and prior work for the startup.</p>



<p>The narrative established by Clearview and most media coverage is that Ton-That and Schwartz excised Johnson from operations at this point. But Johnson continued to assist and advise his co-founders for nearly two more years, according to emails I obtained, connecting them with other potential investors and customers. When the Department of Defense scheduled a meeting in January 2020 for Clearview to pitch its services, the invite included Johnson. The following month, Ton-That sent his friend a proposal to compensate Johnson in Clearview stock for advisory services he provided to the company “with respect to developing, marketing and selling its technology.” In July 2020, Johnson helped Schwartz draft a letter for Rep. Matt Gaetz—a personal friend of Johnson’s—to send to top officials at the Department of Homeland Security, lobbying them to use Clearview to smoke out spies among the “400,000 Chinese nationals who enter the U.S. every year as foreign students.”</p>



<p>A February 2020 dinner in Los Angeles highlighted the company’s significance within the far-right movement. The dinner was one in a series of neoreactionary salons Johnson arranged for “young men of ability and distinction to talk about controversial or provocative topics openly, without fear of reprisal,” according to an invite he sent. Phones were to be checked at the door, unmarried women forbidden. When reached for comment, Johnson said Ton-That had attended a few of these events, including one where he met Steve Sailer, the human biodiversity writer whose articles about race and IQ Ton-That had read for years. Johnson could not remember if Ton-That had attended the Los Angeles dinner. But Sailer was the guest of honor. The next day, Sailer emailed Johnson some advice about Clearview. “One thing to look out for is cops abusing your system,” he warned, presciently. “Another thing: Hoan is a star, so the question is whether you want <em>to ruin his cover</em> and put him on TV.” (Italic Sailer’s. Reached by phone, he acknowledged knowing Clearview’s founders and then hung up.)</p>



<p>Ton-That <em>was</em> a star, at least among the far right. And he would soon be all over TV anyway, the result of a blockbuster January 2020 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html?utm_source=Memberful&amp;utm_campaign=41977c2de4-daily_update_2020_01_21&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_d4c7fece27-41977c2de4-111021813"><em>Times</em> story</a> that revealed Clearview’s existence and explored the privacy-­shattering implications of the technology but did not examine its founders’ politics. While follow-up reporting, including the <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-alt-right_n_5e7d028bc5b6cb08a92a5c48">article</a> I wrote for <em>HuffPost</em>, excavated Ton-That’s links to Johnson and other far-right figures, these associations didn’t stand in the way of Clearview landing its first big <a href="https://www.fpds.gov/common/jsp/LaunchWebPage.jsp?command=execute&amp;requestid=250226748&amp;version=1.5">federal contract</a>, in August 2020, with ICE.</p>



<p>But Johnson and Ton-That’s relationship finally unraveled. In October 2020, enraged by Ton-That’s comments to the media about his involvement with the company, Johnson erupted. “Effective immediately I no longer support the direction of the company nor its leadership,” he emailed Ton-That, Schwartz, and Lambert. It was a bitter parting. Johnson later sued Clearview and his former partners, who filed a still-pending counterclaim. (Lambert’s financial firm has also sued Johnson.)</p>



<p>When an irate Johnson spoke to the <em>Times</em> for a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/18/magazine/facial-recognition-clearview-ai.html">2021 story</a>, Ton-That and Schwartz asserted that he’d violated the secrecy clause in the “wind-down” agreement, which allowed them to buy him out of the company. They paid him $286,579.69.</p>

<p><span>Clearview kept</span> rolling without Johnson. The breakthrough at ICE gave the company a foothold in the federal government. It also brought Johnson and Ton-That’s original vision closer to fruition. As Johnson bombastically described their early mission on Facebook, they were “building algorithms to ID all the illegal immigrants for the deportation squads.” Now, the company had found a willing partner in ICE, which has a history of <a href="https://www.nilc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/396-Fourth-Amended-Complaint.pdf">racial</a> and <a href="https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/2011_05_03_DHS_Letter_re_Border_Questioning.pdf">religious</a> profiling, <a href="https://casetext.com/case/morales-v-chadbourne-1">violating constitutional rights</a>, and <a href="https://americandragnet.org/">invasive data gathering and surveillance</a>.</p>



<p>Since 2016, the agency’s employees and contractors have faced hundreds of internal investigations for misusing various databases of personal information. Department watchdogs investigated ICE employees and contractors for allegedly looking up each other and former lovers, giving information to friends and neighbors, and accessing databases in order to threaten and harass people or sell information to criminals, according to a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ice-agent-database-abuse-records/">2023 <em>Wired</em> report</a>.</p>



<p>Experts believe Clearview is likely already involved in deportation. “If Clearview AI tries to scrape all social media from all around the world, and there is a picture of an immigrant to the United States, then ICE could try to find out who that person is,” says Jack Poulson of <a href="https://www.techinquiry.org/">Tech Inquiry</a>, a watchdog group. “The company emphasizes the use within human trafficking and drug trafficking, but it’s highly unlikely that they would not be actively supporting deportation.”</p>



<p>Indeed, starting in mid-2019, ICE clandest­inely­ piloted the tech through, among other units, its Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) division, which arrests and deports undocumented immigrants. A <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/clearview-ai-fbi-ice-global-law-enforcement"><em>BuzzFeed News</em> investigation</a> found that ICE agents ran more than 8,000 searches during this period.</p>



<p><a href="https://epic.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/EPIC-20-03-06-ICE-FOIA-20210315-Select-Production-Docs.pdf" data-type="link" data-id="https://epic.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/EPIC-20-03-06-ICE-FOIA-20210315-Select-Production-Docs.pdf">Records obtained</a> by the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) and shared with <em>Mother Jones</em> indicate that ICE has mainly used Clearview in its Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) division, which traditionally conducts criminal probes into human trafficking and drug smuggling. But during Trump’s first term, HSI agents were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/us/ICE-BORTAC-sanctuary-cities.html">deeply involved</a> <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2023-06/hsi_memo_implementing_eo_13767_and_13768_02.21.2017.pdf">in deportation actions</a> alongside ERO teams, participating in aggressive raids in sanctuary cities and <a href="https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/ice-executes-federal-search-warrants-multiple-mississippi-locations">sometimes arresting hundreds of undocumented workers</a> in a day. Now, the <a href="https://x.com/FLHSMV/status/1886445789519434204">units are teaming up</a> <a href="https://x.com/EROMiami/status/1898118407540949454">again to round up immigrants</a>.</p>



<p>In Trump’s first term, ICE also dispatched HSI agents to <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-leaked-document-reveals-details-of-federal-law-enforcement-patrolling-washington-amid-protests-154138680.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmV3c3dlZWsuY29tLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAB7EqamKw337cAIszZY-_cFcNVrAf3zz3uYGZ4GlRBW8u0YtuAeG26szRemmOuM_cqelGjRO6Kfw9NXXNgQs1fGT2JbEasZJcLtyTX6MT78VmUI18wFYRBPzVSxDagy1ML2eBhm2ugZD2MQfuZTFibxuUO_A6BpBx1rT3e9lwapB">racial justice protests</a> that erupted around the country after the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.

<p>The EPIC records reveal a culture of indifference at ICE about Clearview’s privacy and civil rights implications. It was a fancy toy that promised a low-cost investigative shortcut. “This can find faces in a crowd and/or it can show a photo in a crowd if you want to ID people he/she may associate with. It was amazing!” one ICE employee marveled. But Clearview spooked some people, including a Customs and Border Protection employee who emailed a colleague at ICE after learning the agency had the tool. “You guys use this?” the CBP staffer wrote. “Looks creepy as hell.” It was. An email from an ICE privacy officer noted that the agency “wants to use facial recognition to track people threatening its agents online.” Only after the <em>Times</em> broke news of Clearview’s existence, according to the records, did ICE conduct a privacy assessment that should have taken place before the agency deployed the tech.</p>



<p>The EPIC files also show that ICE supervisors had little idea how Clearview was being used and struggled to determine which units and agents had access. ERO and HSI had Clearview. But so did task force officers outside of ICE who work with federal law enforcement. More than 100 people connected to the agency were using Clearview around the world in places like Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; Rome; Manila, Philippines; and Ton-That’s hometown of Canberra.</p>



<p>During the Biden administration, demand for Clearview surged within ICE. On March 25, 2022, the agency held a “Clearview expansion meeting.” Lambert has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2025/02/19/clearview-ai-ceo-resigns/">said</a> the bulk of the company’s $16 million in annual recurring revenue still comes from local law enforcement, but ICE has been Clearview’s steadiest customer, paying the facial recognition firm <a href="https://www.fpds.gov/ezsearch/fpdsportal?q=clearview+ai+UEI_NAME%3A%22CLEARVIEW+AI%2C+INC.%22+CONTRACTING_AGENCY_NAME%3A%22U.S.+IMMIGRATION+AND+CUSTOMS+ENFORCEMENT%22&amp;s=FPDS.GOV&amp;templateName=1.5.3&amp;indexName=awardfull&amp;x=19&amp;y=5&amp;sortBy=SIGNED_DATE&amp;desc=Y">nearly $4 million</a>.</p>



<p>In general, the federal government is hungry for facial recognition. The Department of Homeland Security is experimenting with using facial biometrics to monitor migrant children “<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/08/14/1096534/homeland-security-facial-recognition-immigration-border/">down to the infant</a>” and algorithmically predict how they will age so they can be identified if they cross the border years later. Under the Biden administration, CBP already used an <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2025-01/24_0130_priv_pia-cbp-068-appendixupdate.pdf">app with facial recognition</a> to <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/06/16/1074039/border-wall-app/">screen</a> <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/amr51/7985/2024/en/">asylum seekers</a> trying to enter the country; like <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2019/NIST.IR.8280.pdf">most similar technology</a>, the app has shown a bias against darker-skinned people, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/feb/08/us-immigration-cbp-one-app-facial-recognition-bias">blocking Black applicants </a>from filing claims.</p>



<p>Between April 2018 and March 2022, Clearview was used by more federal law enforcement agencies than any other privately owned facial recognition system, according to <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-21-518.pdf">US Government Accountability Office</a> <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-105607.pdf">reports</a> and public reporting. It was deployed by agencies including CBP; the FBI; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; and the Drug Enforcement Administration. Even the US Postal Inspection Service used Clearview, targeting Black Lives Matter protesters in 2020. Many of the agencies failed to comply with privacy requirements. Some told the GAO they didn’t use Clearview, only to be <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolinehaskins1/gao-facial-recognition-report-clearview-federal-agencies">caught later by <em>BuzzFeed News</em></a>, which cross-referenced the report with a leaked list of federal agencies whose employees had run searches.</p>



<p>Hundreds, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facial-recognition-local-police-clearview-ai-table">if not thousands</a>, of local law enforcement departments have also embraced Clearview with even looser oversight. Clearview’s <a href="https://staticfiles.clearview.ai/code_of_conduct.html">user code of conduct</a> states that its search results are “not intended nor permitted to be used as admissible evidence in a court of law or any court filing.” But cops have used the search results, and nothing else, to secure warrants, rather than as leads to support further investigation. This practice has led to <a href="https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2024/01/54.-First-Amended-Complaint.pdf">wrongful</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/06/business/facial-recognition-false-arrest.html">arrests</a> and risks putting every American, not just every immigrant, in a permanent police lineup.</p>



<p>With Congress failing to act on facial recognition, a handful of state laws that protect residents’ biometric information have been the only tool to hold Clearview accountable. Notably, in 2020, the ACLU sued Clearview in Illinois, which led to a 2022 settlement banning the company from making its faceprint database available to most businesses and other private entities nationwide. Another lawsuit, now in California’s courts, was brought by immigrants and racial justice activists who accuse the company of “illegally acquiring, storing, and selling their likenesses, and the likenesses of millions of Californians, in its quest to create a cyber surveillance state.”</p>



<p>“They are making money off our privacy, our own spaces, our biometrics,” says Reyna Maldonado, a DACA recipient who owns a Mexican restaurant in Oakland and is a plaintiff in the suit.</p>



<p>An immigrant rights activist since her teens, Maldonado has publicly protested ICE. But she and the other plaintiffs allege in their suit that Clearview’s chilling effect has already undermined their free speech. “I’m a lot more careful about what I share. I feel like I can’t be fully open about my community organizing work,” Maldonado says. “People think this is only an immigrant struggle and it’s only going to affect those who are undocumented. The reality is they have even more information on people who are citizens.”</p>



<p>Sejal Zota, co-founder and legal director of <a href="https://www.justfutureslaw.org/">Just Futures Law</a>, a civil rights group that helped bring the suit, predicts facial recognition will be used even more widely during Trump’s second term. “We expect to see [it] extend from Trump’s alleged targets—immigrants—to the general public.”</p>

<p><span>In March 2024,</span> the US Commission on Civil Rights <a href="https://www.usccr.gov/meetings/2024/03-08-civil-rights-implications-federal-use-facial-recognition-technology">convened experts</a> at its headquarters near the White House to discuss the dangers of facial recognition. While immigrants were most at risk, privacy advocates told the commission, they were just the initial target. “[They] are canaries in the coal mines on civil liberties because they are positioned as test cases for policies that roll back all of our shared liberties,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnCEGHlmNt4">explained</a> Laura MacCleery, a senior policy director at UnidosUS, the same civil rights organization Ton-That mentioned in his 2017 Border Patrol pitch. Something had to be done, the privacy advocates agreed, before it was too late. But it was already awfully late. Facial recognition technology was thoroughly embedded in the nation’s surveillance infrastructure.</p>



<p>Sitting placidly at the panelists’ table, his long black hair spilling to the shoulders of his gray suit jacket, was one of the people most responsible for that outcome.</p>



<p>“As a person of mixed race,” Ton-That <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLsFuHMjkcE&amp;t=4s">told</a> the commission, “it is especially important to me that this technology is deployed in a way that protects and enhances civil rights.”</p>



<p>Information about Clearview’s ties to extremists was already public, but Ton-That faced not a single question about his background. Nor was he asked how, as a <a href="https://clearviewclassaction.com/Content/Documents/First%20Amended%20Consolidated%20Class%20Action%20Complaint.pdf">class-action lawsuit</a> against the company alleged, violating Illinois law by collecting the “biometric identifiers and biometric information” of citizens without informing them was compatible with civil rights. In September, the commission issued a <a href="https://www.usccr.gov/files/2024-09/civil-rights-implications-of-frt_0.pdf">194-page report</a> that failed to mention Clearview’s radical associations.</p>



<p>The report did acknowledge, however, one of the achievements that Ton-That has trumpeted the most, including before the commission. Clearview, he said, had “played an essential role” in helping investigate the violent insurrectionists who stormed the US Capitol on January 6, an incident he described elsewhere as “tragic and appalling.” The attack had proved an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/09/technology/facial-recognition-clearview-capitol.html">enormous publicity boon</a> for Clearview—and an opportunity to scrub the far-right taint from its image. In <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/washington-post-live/2022/04/27/path-forward-facial-recognition-technology-with-hoan-ton-that/">media</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/18/magazine/facial-recognition-clearview-ai.html">interviews</a>, Ton-That touted Clearview’s ability to track down MAGA criminals. The company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231231004019/https://www.clearview.ai/capitol-riots">published a case study</a> on its website highlighting its role in the “arrest of hundreds of rioters in a short amount of time.”</p>



<p>The boasts struck a discordant note. The politics of Clearview’s founders aligned more closely with those of the rioters. Almost a year after the insurrection, Peter Duke, the founders’ neoreactionary ally, hosted Stop the Steal ringleader Ali Alexander on his podcast to push a conspiracy theory that the attack was a false flag operation by undercover FBI agents. Duke, who was in Washington on January 6, had photographed dozens of rioters at the Capitol who he suspected were federal provocateurs. “They’re not in the Clearview database,” he told Alexander. “I’ve checked.” Duke, who has said he once worked for Clearview as a consultant, took their absence as a sign of a coverup. He later repeated this claim on camera to <em>France 24</em>, explaining that he had friends at Clearview “run the faces.”</p>



<p>It was a startling admission. Clearview’s code of conduct prohibits use of the tech for “personal purposes.” But here was Duke talking about running off-the-books searches in an effort to whitewash an attack on American democracy.</p>



<p>“All of the evidence we have is that [Clearview] is a corporation that cares not at all about civil rights and that their founders have a potentially ideological agenda inconsistent with democracy,” says Emily Tucker, executive director of <a href="https://www.law.georgetown.edu/privacy-technology-center/">Georgetown Law’s Center on Privacy and Technology</a>. “None of that has seemed to slow down their ability to get government contracts in the US or abroad.”</p>



<p>Nobody in a position to hold the company accountable seemed to care about its far-right DNA—and few wanted to consider that the threat to privacy and democracy might not be an unfortunate by-product of the tech, but rather a feature. Tucker said her organization discussed Clearview’s extremist ties with several Biden administration officials, as well as congressional staffers, and she was surprised and concerned by the lack of follow-up. Most media coverage of the company left the issue unmentioned or, worse, downplayed what was known—one interviewer for the financial magazine <em>Inc.</em> <a href="https://www.inc.com/sam-blum/clearview-ais-founder-on-companys-controversial-beginnings-massive-growth-since.html">described</a> the extremists at Clearview as “rogue employees” who had “infiltrated the company.”</p>



<p>In America, the debate about tech harms proceeds from the flawed assumption that tech is neutral. It’s the Silicon Valley version of “guns don’t kill people,” and it obscures the truth in a similar way. This smokescreen allows social media oligarchs to pose as impartial platform owners while their <a href="https://x.com/BuckeyeGirrl/status/1831815291694936317">algorithms</a> <a href="https://x.com/GaSecofState/status/1852159394382786789">spread</a> <a href="https://x.com/JackPosobiec/status/1832855157341884780">lies</a> about Haitian immigrants, or an AI overlord to <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1891112681538523215">claim his tech is unbiased</a> even as it <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/elon-musks-grok-spreads-false-election-information">amplifies</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/a9fd8c2b-68bf-4965-933e-a0b337322d92.pdf?itid=lk_inline_manual_2">election misinformation</a>. Technology doesn’t exist in a political vacuum—indeed, it can be an ideological tool. A designer can <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-023-02079-x">imbue</a> <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2413-4155/6/1/3">bias</a> into their creation.</p>



<p>Today, there is no longer a need for Clearview to pretend to be apolitical. Lambert, the company’s new co-CEO, is <a href="https://www.fpds.gov/ezsearch/fpdsportal?q=Umbra&amp;s=FPDS.GOV&amp;templateName=1.5.3&amp;indexName=awardfull&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;sortBy=SIGNED_DATE&amp;desc=Y">already in busines</a>s with both Elon Musk’s SpaceX and the Department of Defense through a separate satellite company, and he has made no secret of his desire to deploy Clearview as an instrument of MAGA rule. “Under the Trump administration, we would hope to grow more than we were able to under the Biden administration,” <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2025/02/19/clearview-ai-ceo-resigns/">he told <em>Forbes</em></a>. “We’re talking to the [Pentagon], we’re talking to Homeland Security. There are a number of different agencies we’re in active dialogue with.”</p>



<p>In the emails I obtained, Lambert expressed a desire to “take down these lefties” and railed against the “communist academia left.” Unlike his predecessor, who at least paid lip service to the rule of law after January 6, Lambert helped to gin up unscientific and inaccurate analyses of voter data that Republicans used to back <a href="https://casetext.com/case/bowyer-v-ducey">false claims</a> <a href="https://electioncases.osu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Wood-v-Raffensperger-11th-Cir-Doc40.pdf">of voter fraud</a> after the 2020 election.</p>



<p>Even before the leadership shakeup became public, it was evident to the careful observer that changes were afoot at Clearview in anticipation of the new administration. Days before Trump was again sworn in as president, vowing to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/granting-pardons-and-commutation-of-sentences-for-certain-offenses-relating-to-the-events-at-or-near-the-united-states-capitol-on-january-6-2021/">pardon the insurrectionists</a> who attacked the Capitol in his name, the company <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250118115524/https://www.clearview.ai/">updated its website</a>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250107035607/https://www.clearview.ai/">Deleted were any references</a> to its role in identifying the far-right marauders who had laid siege to democracy.</p>

<p>It’s time Lua got the ecosystem it deserves!</p>
<p>For a bit over a year, we have been cooking up <a href="https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/lux">Lux</a>,
a new package manager for creating, maintaining and publishing Lua code.
It does this through a simple and intuitive CLI inspired by other
well-known package managers like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/"><code>cargo</code></a>.</p>
<p>Today, we feel the project has hit a state of “very usable for everyday tasks”<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fully portable between systems.</li>
<li>Parallel builds and installs. 🚀</li>
<li>Handles the installation of Lua headers<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> for you.
Forget about users complaining they have the wrong Lua headers installed on their system.
All you need to do is specify compatible lua versions.</li>
<li>A fully embeddable <code>lux-lib</code> crate, which can even be built to expose a Lua API.</li>
<li>Has an actual notion of a “project”, with a simple governing <code>lux.toml</code> file.
<ul>
<li>Uses the <code>lux.toml</code> to auto-generate rockspecs.
Say goodbye to managing 10 different rockspec files in your repository. 🎉</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Powerful lockfile support.
<ul>
<li>Fully reproducible builds and developer environments.</li>
<li>Source + rockspec hashes that can be used to make Lux easy to integrate with <a href="https://nixos.org/">Nix</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Integrated code formatting (<code>lx fmt</code>) and linting (<code>lx check</code>)
powered by <a href="https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua"><code>stylua</code></a>
and <a href="https://github.com/mpeterv/luacheck"><code>luacheck</code></a>.</li>
<li>Native support for running tests with <a href="https://lunarmodules.github.io/busted/"><code>busted</code></a>.
<ul>
<li>Including the ability to use Neovim as a Lua interpreter.</li>
<li>Sets up a pure environment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Compatible with the luarocks ecosystem.
<ul>
<li>In case you have a complex rockspec that you don’t want to rewrite to TOML,
lux allows you to create an <code>extra.rockspec</code> file, so everything just works.</li>
<li>Need to install a package that uses a custom luarocks build backend?
Lux can install luarocks and shell out to it for the build step,
while managing dependencies natively.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<h3 id="lua">Lua</h3>
<p>While extensive, Luarocks carries with it around 20 years of baggage,
which makes it difficult to make suitable for modern Lua development, while
retaining backward compatibility.</p>
<p>With Lux, we’re pushing for a fresh start:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A notion of a project:</strong>
<ul>
<li>With TOML as the main manifest format, you can easily add, remove, pin
and update dependencies using the CLI.</li>
<li>If you’re in a project directory (with a <code>lux.toml</code>), commands like <code>build</code>
will build your project, and install it into a project-local tree.</li>
<li>Building will produce a lockfile of your project’s dependencies,
allowing you to reproduce your exact dependencies on any compatible system.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Enforced SemVer:</strong>
Luarocks allows for arbitrary versions after the patch version.
For example, <code>1.0.1.0.0.0.2</code> is considered valid by Luarocks, but it has no
useful meaning.
Lux will parse this too, but will treat everything after the patch
version as a prerelease version.
We made this decision because we want to encourage package maintainers
to stick to <a href="https://semver.org/">SemVer</a> for their releases.</li>
<li><strong>Parallel builds:</strong>
Inspired by the Nix store, Lux hashes<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> install directories to prevent
package conflicts and enable highly parallel builds without risking file system corruption.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="neovim">Neovim</h3>
<p>Thanks to our Neovim plugin manager, <a href="https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/rocks.nvim"><code>rocks.nvim</code></a>,
and the later addition of Luarocks support to <a href="https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim"><code>lazy.nvim</code></a>,
Luarocks has been steadily gaining popularity in the Neovim space as a way of distributing
plugins.
But it’s been heavily held back by not being fully portable and by being unpredictable
from system to system.
Because Luarocks is written in Lua, installing a large number of packages
and synchronising plugins with <code>rocks.nvim</code> has been painfully slow.</p>
<p>With Lux, we hope that plugins will start treating themselves as Lua projects.
Using Lux is non-destructive and doesn’t interfere with the current way of
distributing Neovim plugins (which is via git).</p>
<p>In fact, Lux has a <code>--nvim</code> flag, which tells it to install packages into a tree
structure that is compatible with Neovim’s <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/repeat.html#packages"><code>:h packages</code></a>.</p>
<h3 id="nix">Nix</h3>
<p>If a Neovim plugin exists as a Luarocks package, <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs"><code>nixpkgs</code></a>
will use it as the source of truth.
This is mainly because with a proper package manager, the responsibility of declaring dependencies
is the responsibility of the package author.
However, Luarocks has very basic lockfile support, which does not include source hashes.
While Luarocks (as does Lux) supports conflicting dependencies
via its <a href="https://luarocks.org/modules/hisham/luarocks-loader"><code>luarocks.loader</code></a>,
nixpkgs cannot reasonably add multiple versions of the same dependency to its package set.
Lux’s <a href="https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/lux/blob/5d2bee87a99afb6e532421d381d1b4986b855d56/lux-lib/resources/test/sample-project-lockfile-missing-deps/lux.lock"><code>lux.lock</code></a>,
stores source and rockspec hashes of each dependency.
If the source URL is a git repository, lux will store a <a href="https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.26/store/file-system-object/content-address#serial-nix-archive">NAR hash</a>.
This means the a <code>lux.lock</code> can be used to create a <a href="https://bmcgee.ie/posts/2023/02/nix-what-are-fixed-output-derivations-and-why-use-them/"><code>fixed-output derivation</code></a>
with all dependencies, just as you can do with a <code>Cargo.lock</code>.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>Right now, our priorities are set on squashing bugs and improving error messages.
Soon, we’ll be rewriting <code>rocks.nvim</code> to use Lux instead of Luarocks under the hood.
This should let rocks.nvim catch up with other plugin managers in terms of speed
and make it endlessly more stable than before.
If the rewrite is successful, then that spells great news for the Neovim ecosystem
going forward, as it means that Lux can be embedded in other places too
(e.g.&nbsp;lazy.nvim, which has had troubles with luarocks in the past)!</p>

  <h2>For decades, software reuse was only a lofty goal. Now it's very real.</h2> 
  <h3>Russ Cox</h3> 
  <p>In March 1972, the United States Air Force started a review of a Honeywell Multics system to understand whether it could be used in secure environments. The report was issued in mid-1974 and concluded that Multics, while not secure, was better than its peers and might be a reasonable starting point for a secure system.<sup>23</sup> The report raised the potential of adding a backdoor (it was called a "trap door") to an innocent system call. When passed a specific, very unlikely input, the system call allowed reading or writing an arbitrary word of kernel memory. That tiny change would completely undermine the security of the system, and the report investigated the mechanics of how such a change might be made and hidden.</p> 
  <p>In March 2024, Andres Freund, a Postgres developer working at Microsoft, noticed that his Debian Linux system's ssh daemon was taking more CPU than normal to handle the Internet's usual background attack traffic that was trying to brute force logins into his machine. Upon closer investigation, Freund discovered that the latest version of liblzma, a compression library linked into ssh on Debian systems, contained a backdoor that targeted ssh specifically.<sup>19</sup> Now, when passed a specific, very unlikely input, the ssh daemon would allow an attacker on the Internet to execute an arbitrary shell command. This tiny change completely undermined the security of bleeding-edge Debian systems, and for the next few weeks, security researchers all over the world investigated the mechanics of how the change was made and hidden. Because liblzma was distributed as part of the xz project, this attack is now widely known as the xz attack.</p> 
  <p>The contours of the problems in software supply chain security have not changed in half a century because they are fundamental. There are no easy answers in computer security; software supply chain security is no exception. The best we can aim to do is keep improving our defenses, and many promising reinforcements are not yet universally deployed. This article aims to highlight promising approaches that should be more widely used as well as point out areas where more work is needed.</p> 
  <p>I led the development of the Go programming language and environment<sup>15</sup> for more than a decade, and software supply chain security is one of the specific focuses of that effort. This article is informed by that work and draws some examples from my personal experience, in addition to examples drawn from across the software industry.</p> 
   
  <h3>Exploring the Problem</h3> 
  <p>Open source software supply chain security is a hot topic, especially after the xz attack, but what exactly does it mean? In the absence of an agreed-upon definition, I suggest this one, in three parts:</p> 
  <p>1. An open source software supply chain<i> attack</i> is the insertion of nefarious open source code into trusted software before delivery. (This definition adapts one by Kim Zetter.<sup>35</sup>)</p> 
  <p>2. An open source software supply chain<i> vulnerability</i> is an exploitable weakness in trusted software caused by a third-party, open source component of that software.</p> 
  <p>3. Open source software supply chain<i> security</i> is the engineering of defenses against open source software supply chain attacks and vulnerabilities.</p> 
   
  <p>There are a few important nuances to this definition.</p> 
  <p>The first is that the hardware supply chain is not of concern here. For example, <i>Der Spiegel</i> reported in 2013 that the U.S. NSA (National Security Agency) can intercept a new computer ordered by a target and install backdoored software or hardware components into it.<sup>1</sup> That kind of physical attack is beyond the scope of this discussion of the software supply chain, although it may still be important to consider and defend against in certain contexts.</p> 
  <p>A second nuance is that closed source software components are not of concern. For example, in 2012, attackers broke into Juniper Networks and changed the VPN (virtual private network) source code, replacing some critical constants in a random number generator. The effect was to create a backdoor that made it possible for the attackers to decrypt all VPN traffic that Juniper's customers sent through those devices.<sup>8</sup> This is a software supply chain attack because it changed the software before its delivery to Juniper's customers. But it is not an open source software supply chain attack, because the nefarious change was not made in one of the open source components used in Jupiter's VPN. (The random-number generator was easily backdoored in the first place thanks to the NSA mounting what might be considered an algorithmic supply chain attack.<sup>6</sup>)</p> 
  <p>As another example, developers in China often look for copies of Xcode on file-sharing sites hosted in China, which are faster to download. In 2015, security researchers discovered that attackers had posted a modified copy of Xcode and worked to make it the top Chinese-language search result for "Xcode download." This version, which researchers named XcodeGhost, had been nefariously altered to add malicious code to every iOS app it built. It was downloaded and used by many app developers, and the injected malware made it into at least two widely used apps.<sup>34</sup> This is a software supply chain attack on the distribution mechanism rather than the original software, but, once again, it is not targeting open source software.</p> 
  <p>A third nuance is that the affected software does not itself need to be open source. For example, in 2021 security researchers discovered that the open source Java logging library Log4j would download and execute Java code from arbitrary URLs when logging text with a certain format.<sup>33</sup> Log4j is widely used in the Java ecosystem. As one example among millions of affected programs, in the popular game Minecraft, simply sending a chat message was sufficient to achieve remote code execution on the game server. Minecraft is, therefore, an example of a closed source program affected by an open source software supply chain vulnerability. Since almost all closed source programs use open source components,<sup>2</sup> they all depend on good open source software supply chain security.</p> 
  <p>A final nuance is that attacks that involve code written with nefarious intent are distinguished from vulnerabilities that involve innocent bugs. For example, in 2021 Apple fixed a bug that allowed so-called zero-click takeovers of an iPhone device by sending an iMessage with a specially crafted image attachment. The attachment identified itself as a GIF but was actually a PDF containing a JBIG2 image. Apple's software used the open source Xpdf JBIG2 decoder, written in C, and that decoder did not properly validate the encoded Huffman trees in the image; this made it possible to trigger bitwise operations on memory at attacker-controlled offsets beyond an allocated region. The attackers implemented an entire virtual CPU out of these bitwise operations and then implemented code in that virtual instruction set to scan process memory, break out of the iMessage sandbox, and take over the phone.<sup>4</sup> The JBIG2 bug was only accidentally (not nefariously) introduced, so it is an open source software supply chain vulnerability, not an attack. Vulnerabilities and attacks are distinct problems with distinct potential solutions.</p> 
  <p>As another example, in 2018 researchers discovered that the npm package event-stream contained obfuscated code that harvested bitcoin wallets when linked into the Copay mobile app.<sup>21</sup> The nefarious code explicitly targeted Copay, making that app an example of a closed source program affected by an open source software supply chain attack.</p> 
  <p>Although the last two examples ultimately impacted closed source applications, attacks on purely open source software stacks are also possible. The xz attack did exactly this, attacking OpenSSH through a component of its software supply chain—liblzma—instead of a direct attack on the OpenSSH source code or project itself. Even a purely open source attack can be devastating: If a few more months had passed before its discovery, the backdoored sshd (Secure Shell daemon) would have been deployed in sensitive contexts worldwide.</p> 
  <p>Although there is no silver bullet, the remainder of this article highlights the general themes for engineering better defenses as well as practical steps being taken today.</p> 
   
  <h3>Understand the Software Supply Chain</h3> 
  <p>To secure your software supply chain, you first have to understand what it is. Let's start with the definition: The <i>software supply chain</i> is all the places where a software supply chain attack might happen or vulnerability might be introduced. The more important meaning of <i>understand</i>, however, is knowing what your specific software supply chain looks like, and that turns out to be quite difficult. The word <i>chain</i> sounds simple, but a supply chain is like a fractal: complex no matter how closely you look at it.</p> 
  <p>At the lowest level, you can look at the commands executed to build a single program and the dependencies between those commands. These build graphs align with the package dependency structure of the program itself. Even for simple programs, these graphs are so complex as to be unprintable. The Go project makes it a priority to avoid unnecessary dependencies and keep software simple,<sup>15</sup> and yet, as I write this article, building the <code>go</code> command executes 714 commands to build 297 packages, with 3,132 dependency edges in its package graph. The <code>go</code> command is unusual in that it has no external dependencies: All the packages it uses are part of the Go project itself. Looking at a slightly more complex command, Kubernetes's kubelet executes 3,289 commands in its build and depends on 1,581 packages from 137 Go modules, including many from outside the Kubernetes project. Both these examples are fairly small, low-level utilities. Higher-level programs have even more complex builds. In <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3723000">another article in this issue of <i>acmqueue</i></a>, Josie Anugerah and Eve Martin-Jones examine the complexity of open source build graphs in more detail, along with the surprise that most programs have many possible build graphs, depending on the exact context in which they are built.</p> 
  <p>It is tempting to think these kinds of dependency graphs are the entire software supply chain, but they are only the most visible part. Each package or module in the dependency graph may be written by a different person or organization, with different security practices, code review standards, and so on. It would be helpful to know more about these details for every dependency you take on, but in general, this information is unavailable and can change over time.</p> 
  <p>Another kind of graph shows the computers and services that software passes through during a build and during distribution to users. A nefarious alteration could be made in any one of these computers or services, making each one a different potential attack site, not to mention a potential source of vulnerabilities. You should be concerned with who has access to each dependency project, who might have access in the future, what infrastructure they use, and so on. For the most part, without visibility into any of that, it goes ignored. But it's all still there.</p> 
  <p>Understanding the software supply chain is critical to identifying which links need to be reinforced. As an industry, we have much more work to do here, but for this article, let's move on to specific reinforcements already known to help.</p> 
   
  <h3>Authenticate Software</h3> 
  <p>The Multics review contemplated inserting backdoors "during the distribution phase," taking advantage of "insecure telecommunications" as well as sending out nefarious updates "using forged stationery." The wording may be outdated, but the ideas are not. XcodeGhost is a modern example of exactly that approach. Fixing this problem is the nearest thing to a true success story in modern software supply chain security. Cryptographic signatures make it impossible to nefariously alter code between signing and verifying. The only problem left is key distribution: The verifier has to know who should have signed the code.</p> 
  <p>There are many possible answers to the key distribution problem. The simplest one is to ignore questions of identity and simply record and distribute the expected cryptographic hash of the specific dependency versions being used in a given build or package manager. Verification of these predistributed hashes completely removes download servers, proxies, and other network middleboxes as potential attack sites. Debian's system for packaging dependencies includes such a check, which meant the xz attacker could not simply modify an existing copy of xz; they needed to release a new version. That didn't prevent the attack, but it did make the attack harder.</p> 
  <p>On a larger scale, instead of predistributing all these hashes, they can be maintained in a trusted database. The Go checksum database<sup>16</sup> is a real-world example of this approach that protects millions of Go developers. The database holds the SHA256 checksum of every version of every public Go module. Each database entry is signed by the database server's private key. The corresponding public key is hard-coded in the Go command source code, so key distribution piggybacks on the rest of the Go distribution. </p> 
  <p>Every time the <code>go</code> command downloads a new open source Go package, it looks up the expected checksum. There is a local checksum cache for dependencies in a given project, so network calls to the checksum server happen only for upgrades or adding new dependencies, but one way or another, every download is checked. This means all the proxies and other boxes between code hosting and a user's computer cannot be attack sites. Even an attack on the code hosting site cannot change old packages.</p> 
  <p>There is, of course, the question of what checksum to put into the database. For Go, if the database hasn't recorded a specific package version yet, it fetches the code directly and stores the checksum for the code it gets. This "trust on first use" approach doesn't mean the code is trustworthy, but it does mean that the code can't change if anyone else downloads it on a different computer tomorrow. This immutability ensures that the entire Go ecosystem agrees on the meaning of Kubernetes version 1.28.4, which serves as a foundation for any other analysis work.</p> 
  <p>To the extent that questions of identity can be solved, having authors sign their software can provide even stronger guarantees. In the case of xz, distribution packages were signed using the individual author's GPG (Gnu Privacy Guard) keys, making it possible to distinguish the packages signed by the original (trustworthy) maintainer of xz and the ones signed by the attacker who had taken control of the project.</p> 
   
  <h3>Make Builds Reproducible</h3> 
  <p>The Multics review noted that a nefarious change might "best be hidden in changes to the binary code of a compiled routine," leaving the corresponding source code unmodified. Such a change would persist only until a rebuild from source code, but most installations would not rebuild source code without reason. This remains a concern today. For example, the critical lines of code that triggered the xz attack during its build were included only in the packaged distribution, not in the actual source control repository.<sup>14</sup></p> 
  <p>The best and most obvious way to verify that binaries have not been modified is to rebuild them and check the result against the distributed binaries, but that assumes builds are reproducible. Since computers are deterministic, it sounds like this should be trivial, but it is far too easy for contextual information like the build machine architecture or machine name, the names of temporary directories, or the current time to end up in some build output, making the overall build nonreproducible. The Reproducible Builds<sup>31</sup> project aims to raise awareness of reproducible builds generally, as well as building tools to help make progress toward complete reproducibility for all Linux software.</p> 
  <p>The Go project recently arranged for Go itself to be completely reproducible given only the source code, meaning that although a build needs some computer running some operating system and some earlier Go toolchain, none of those choices matters. A build for a given target produces the same distribution bits whether you build on Linux or Windows or Mac, whether the build host is X86 or ARM, and so on. Strong reproducibility makes it possible for others to easily verify that the binaries that are posted for download match the source code. Those binaries are also logged in the Go checksum database and verified when the <code>go</code> command downloads a new toolchain, so that downloads can't be modified in transit.<sup>10</sup></p> 
  <p>Authenticating software and making builds reproducible remove potential attack vectors, although certainly not all. Let's turn our focus now to vulnerabilities.</p> 
   
  <h3>Find and Fix Vulnerabilities Quickly</h3> 
  <p>Fifty years ago, there was some hope that software could be made completely secure by correct design and careful implementation. We know better now. Accepting that software will always have vulnerabilities, we must be ready to find and fix those vulnerabilities as quickly as possible when they arise.</p> 
  <p>Since attackers are looking for those vulnerabilities too, the best defense is to find and fix them first. The most trivial example is an out-of-date dependency with a known vulnerability. There are many available vulnerability scanning tools that can identify this situation, whether language-specific tools like govulncheck and npm audit, general open source tools like osv-scanner,<sup>30</sup> or commercial tools. All of them work by cross-checking a list of the software inputs to a build—the <i>software bill of materials</i>—against a database of known vulnerabilities. </p> 
  <p>The specific choice of tool or database is not as important as it used to be. The open source software community has standardized on the OSV (Open Source Vulnerabilities) format<sup>7</sup> for individual vulnerability descriptions, including a precise, algorithmic description of the affected packages and versions. The OSV database<sup>29</sup> then aggregates all the language-specific databases. The CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) database's JSON 5.0 schema also adopted OSV's precise information about affected packages and versions, enabling interchange between OSV and CVE. It benefits everyone for all tools to have access to the same, complete information about known vulnerabilities.</p> 
  <p>It is important to scan your software regularly, ideally daily, because even if your software is not changing, new entries are always being added to the database. And then you need to be ready to update to a fixed version of that dependency. This requires having comprehensive testing to make sure that the fixed version does not introduce any new bugs, as well as having automated deployment, so that a patched version of your software can go out in hours or days, not weeks or months. </p> 
  <p>Testing and deployment are standard software engineering concerns, not specifically about supply chain security, but without them, your security posture suffers, as can your legal exposure. When the Log4j vulnerability was discovered in 2021, it took most companies weeks or months (or more) to inventory all their software to determine what was affected and then update and redeploy that software. Even the U.S. FTC (Federal Trade Commission) issued a statement warning companies to update Log4j to "reduce the likelihood of harm to consumers, and to avoid FTC legal action,"<sup>18</sup> pointing to Equifax's previous liability for an intrusion enabled by unpatched software.<sup>17</sup></p> 
  <p>Scanning for known vulnerabilities is the bare minimum. Effort should ideally also be spent looking for as-yet-unknown vulnerabilities in your open source dependencies. When you run security audits of your own source code, it is often worthwhile to identify critical open source dependencies and audit them too. Running bug-finding analysis tools or fuzzers on your software and its dependencies can also be effective. Attackers are going to use all these methods; you might as well use them first.</p> 
   
  <h3>Prevent Vulnerabilities</h3> 
  <p>Even if software will always have vulnerabilities, there are steps you can take to prevent certain kinds or to make them less likely.</p> 
  <p>To start, omit needless dependencies. Gordon Bell once observed that "[t]he cheapest, fastest and most reliable components of a computer system are those that aren't there."<sup>5</sup> The most secure software dependencies are the ones not used in the first place: Every dependency adds risk. </p> 
  <p>The OpenSSH project is careful about not taking on unnecessary dependencies, but Debian was not as careful. That distribution patched sshd to link against libsystemd, which in turn linked against a variety of compression packages, including xz's liblzma. Debian's relaxing of sshd's dependency posture was a key enabler for the attack, as well as the reason its impact was limited to Debian-based systems such as Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora, avoiding other distributions such as Arch, Gentoo, and NixOS. Weeks before the xz attack was deployed, system developers had been discussing removal of the dependency on compressors such as liblzma, specifically to improve security. It is pure speculation, but those discussions may have accelerated the timeline for launching the attack.<sup>3</sup></p> 
  <p>The same lesson applies to all projects, large and small. If it is possible to get by without a dependency, that's usually best. If not, small dependencies are better than large ones, and the number of transitive dependencies matters. Look not only at the one dependency being added but also at its impact on the overall dependency graph, using tools like Open Source Insights.<sup>27</sup></p> 
  <p>Another good way to prevent vulnerabilities is to use safer programming languages that remove error-prone language features or make them needed less often. In 2022, the NSA released a recommendation on "Software Memory Safety" encouraging the use of memory-safe languages such as C#, Go, Java, or Rust instead of C and C++.<sup>26</sup> Among the many strikes against C and C++, manual memory management and the lack of any kind of bounds checking simply make programs too easy to get wrong in a way that creates a security vulnerability. Their reliance on "undefined behavior" adds another level of danger.<sup>9</sup> Of course, there is a substantial amount of C and C++ code in the world, and those programs cannot be abandoned overnight. For new efforts, however, adopting a safer language has significant security benefits.</p> 
   
  <h3>Fund Open Source</h3> 
  <p><a href="https://xkcd.com/2347/">A famous xkcd comic from 2020</a> depicts "all modern digital infrastructure" built atop "a project some random person in Nebraska has been thanklessly maintaining since 2003."<sup>25</sup> The comic remains a disturbingly accurate assessment of the situation.</p> 
  <p>In 2014, researchers discovered that OpenSSL, a library widely used by Internet HTTPS servers, would respond to a specific kind of malformed packet by sending back arbitrary chunks of server memory. In some cases, that memory included the server's secret-key material. This was not an attack, but instead, an innocent coding mistake. (OpenSSL is written in C, so this mistake was incredibly easy to make and miss; in a memory-safe language with proper bounds checking, it would have been nearly impossible.) </p> 
  <p>The vulnerability was named Heartbleed and prompted a reckoning across the industry about exactly the situation described in the xkcd comic. At the time, OpenSSL was maintained by a handful of volunteers, with only one full-time developer. Researchers estimated that a security audit costing on the order of $100,000 would have caught the mistake, but the project received only $2,000 in annual donations, despite billions of dollars of commerce relying on the software each year. One outcome of this reckoning was the creation and funding of the Linux Foundation's Core Infrastructure Initiative, which evolved into the Open Source Security Foundation, or OpenSSF.<sup>28</sup> </p> 
  <p>OpenSSF is an important step forward, but it has not solved the problem of modern digital infrastructure depending on critical underfunded projects. More work is needed.</p> 
  <p>The xz attack is the clearest possible demonstration that the problem is not fixed. It was enabled as much by underfunding of open source as by any technical detail. Here's the story of the xz attack.</p> 
  <p>Lasse Collin started the xz project in 2005, using the LZMA compression algorithm, which compressed files to about 70 percent of what gzip did. Over time, this format became widely used for compressing tar files, Linux kernel images, and many other uses. For the most part, the software was stable and did not need significant ongoing attention. Collin was not paid for it, and it was not his full-time job. </p> 
  <p>In late 2021, an attacker using the (almost certainly not real) name "Jia Tan" started sending innocuous patches with small improvements to the xz development mailing list.<sup>22</sup> In mid-2022, the attacker started posting using other accounts and names on the mailing list, complaining about the slow pace of releases and new features, and pressuring Collin to cede control to someone with more time. They wrote things like, "The current maintainer lost interest or doesn't care to maintain anymore. It is sad to see for a repo like this." Also, "I get that this is a hobby project for all contributors, but the community desires more. Why not pass on maintainership...?" </p> 
  <p>The pressure campaign worked. Over the next year and a half, Collin turned over more and more development responsibility to the attacker, who built trust by making honest improvements and doing important maintenance work. In early 2023, the attacker built their first official xz release; as 2023 went on, they laid the technical groundwork for the actual attack, ultimately launched in early 2024.<sup>13</sup> </p> 
  <p>In the months after the attack was discovered, most speculation focused on the likelihood that the xz attack was carried out by nation-state hackers,<sup>22</sup> with no confirmation one way or the other. No matter who was responsible, it likely did not cost much. A competent software engineer working full-time on an open source project for two years to gain the trust of its maintainer probably costs less than a million dollars. The development of the exploit code itself, which was quite sophisticated, might cost another million dollars or so. A hidden backdoor into the vast majority of Linux ssh servers on the Internet would be worth many times more than that, possibly billions of dollars. The general underfunding of open source projects makes them directly susceptible to this kind of honest-seeming free help.</p> 
  <p>The social engineering of the xz attack is also not an isolated incident. In the event-stream attack mentioned earlier, the attacker simply asked whether the original author wanted someone to take over maintenance. In the aftermath of the xz attack, the OpenSSF and the OpenJS Foundation issued a warning about a similar campaign that had been unsuccessfully carried out against OpenJS.<sup>20</sup></p> 
  <p>It is far from obvious how best to fund open source development. More than a decade after Heartbleed and the launch of the Core Infrastructure Initiative, the problem clearly remains unsolved. </p> 
   
  <h3>Conclusion</h3> 
  <p>We are all struggling with a massive shift that has happened in the past 10 or 20 years in the software industry. For decades, software reuse was only a lofty goal. Now it's very real.<sup>12</sup> Modern programming environments such as Go, Node, and Rust have made it trivial to reuse work by others, but our instincts about responsible behaviors have not yet adapted to this new reality.</p> 
  <p>The fact that the 1974 Multics review anticipated many of the problems we face today is evidence that these problems are fundamental and have no easy answers. We must work to make continuous improvements to open source software supply chain security, making attacks more and more difficult and expensive. </p> 
  <p>There are important steps we can take today, such as adopting software signatures in some form, making sure to scan for known vulnerabilities regularly, and being ready to update and redeploy software when critical new vulnerabilities are found. More and more development should be shifted to safer languages that make vulnerabilities and attacks less likely. We also need to find ways to fund open source development to make it less susceptible to takeover by the mere offer of free help. Relatively small investments in OpenSSL and xz development could have prevented both the Heartbleed vulnerability and the xz attack.</p> 
  <p>The xz attack seems to be the first major attack on the open source software supply chain. The event-stream attack was similar but not major, and Heartbleed and Log4j were vulnerabilities, not attacks. But the xz attack was discovered essentially by accident because it made sshd just a bit too slow at startup. Attacks, by their nature, try to remain hidden. What are the chances we would accidentally discover the very first major attack on the open source software supply chain in just a few weeks? Perhaps we were extremely lucky, or perhaps we have missed others.</p> 
  <p>The Multics review is famous for pointing out the possibility of adding a backdoor to a compiler to insert backdoors in critical system programs during compilation as XcodeGhost later did, and then the possibility of having the compiler backdoor <i>itself</i>, so that the modifications would persist even after a full recompilation of the compiler. Reading the report inspired Ken Thompson to implement exactly that attack on an early Unix system, probably in early 1975. He later explained the attack in his 1983 Turing Award lecture, published in <i>Communications of the ACM</i> as "Reflections on Trusting Trust."<sup>32</sup> Thompson kept the original attack source code, and with his permission, I published an annotated copy in 2023.<sup>11</sup> Perhaps the most unsettling part is how short it is: 99 lines of C and a 20-line shell script.</p> 
  <p>In his lecture, Thompson said, "The moral is obvious: You can't trust code that you did not totally create yourself." But today, we do that all the time, whether the trust is warranted or not. We use source code downloaded from strangers on the Internet in our most critical applications; almost no one is checking the code.</p> 
  <p>Lawrence Kesteloot's excellent short story "Coding Machines"<sup>24</sup> imagines a computing world under attack from Thompson's backdoor writ large. In our actual world, the sophistication of this kind of backdoor is simply not necessary. There are far easier ways to mount a supply chain attack, such as asking a maintainer if they would like some help. It would be nice to live in a world where attacks require the level of sophistication described by Thompson and Kesteloot.</p> 
  <p>We all have more work to do.</p>

	  <br>
	  It seems like it should be easy to avoid installing vulnerable open source software, but dependency graphs are surprisingly complex. At the time of writing, the latest version of the popular npm tool webpack has millions of potential dependency graphs depending on circumstances during its resolution. The exact graph chosen for a given package can depend on what other software is being built, what kind of system is building it, and even the state of the ecosystem on a given day.

	  <br>
	  Much of the existing research about open source elects to study software repositories instead of ecosystems. An open source repository most often refers to the artifacts recorded in a version control system and occasionally includes interactions around the repository itself. An open source ecosystem refers to a collection of repositories, the community, their interactions, incentives, behavioral norms, and culture. The decentralized nature of open source makes holistic analysis of the ecosystem an arduous task, with communities and identities intersecting in organic and evolving ways. Despite these complexities, the increased scrutiny on software security and supply chains makes it of the utmost importance to take an ecosystem-based approach when performing research about open source.

It’s actually a pretty fascinating method of collaboration - it is massively scalable, highly distributed, local first, capable of fine grained discussion of patches, cryptographically securable, etc. </p><p>The gist of the mailing list collaboration flow is:</p><ul><li>publish a tarball (sort of zip file) of a known state of the project</li><li>people download that and expand it locally</li><li>modify it with whatever feature or fix they want to change</li><li>run <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com" rel="noreferrer">GNU diff</a> on it to create a patch that the maintainer can apply to that initial known state to add that feature</li><li>email that patch or a series of them to a mailing list</li><li>the list discusses the changes</li><li>the maintainer applies the patch for the next tarball release or asks for changes</li><li>repeat</li></ul><p>I would love to do a whole blog post about how mailing list collaboration works and how cool various aspects of it are, but that’s for another time.</p><p>However, in this world, the version control systems of the time were simply not helpful - they seemed like a step backward in functionality. They had clunky access control mechanisms, they weren’t distributed, they were incredibly slow. </p><p>The community worked primarily with <strong>patches and tarballs</strong> and existing SCMs were just not good enough.</p><p>If you think about it, the patches and tarballs workflow is sort of the first <em>distributed</em> version control system - everyone has a local copy, the changes can be made locally, access to "merge" is whomever can push a new tarball to the server.</p><p>However, the process was still a bit cumbersome - managing the patches, remembering what was applied and who contributed it, keeping multiple series in flight, dealing with conflicts or rebasing changes.</p><p> The <a href="https://www.bitkeeper.org/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com" rel="noreferrer">Bitkeeper</a> tool was developed specifically for the kernel's use case to try to build a version control system that worked for this workflow and Linus did like it, but the licensing they wanted to use didn’t vibe with the community it was built for. </p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MPFgOnACULU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="BitKeeper | Ep. 4 Bits and Booze"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>If you want to learn more about Bitkeeper, check out this Bits and Booze episode where we set it up and show you how it was used.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>It’s important to understand that this is why Git was created. Not to be a version control system really, but fundamentally to be a better way to do patches and tarballs - snapshot a set of files and show differences that can be discussed.</p><p>This is primarily how it’s data structure was designed (linked lists of trees of files, content addressable blob storage) and that structure is fundamentally unchanged, from the first commit to this very day.</p><h2 id="the-first-commit">The First Commit</h2><p>Since we're on the topic, what did the <a href="https://github.com/git/git/commit/e83c5163316f89bfbde7d9ab23ca2e25604af290?ref=blog.gitbutler.com" rel="noreferrer">first commit</a> look like? What could Git do from it’s first moment of existence?</p><p>Well, it was a <strong>stupid content tracker</strong>. As Linus himself put it <a href="https://github.com/git/git/commit/e83c5163316f89bfbde7d9ab23ca2e25604af290?ref=blog.gitbutler.com#diff-2b7814d3fca2e99e56c51b6ff2aa313ea6e9da6424804240aa8ad891fdfe0900R15-R17" rel="noreferrer">from day one</a>: </p><blockquote>This is a stupid (but extremely fast) directory content manager. It doesn't do a whole lot, but what it <em>does</em> do is track directory contents efficiently.</blockquote><p>The first commit was a collection of seven simple stand alone tools. They weren’t things like <code>git commit</code>, they were very low level database tools like <code>write-tree</code> and <code>commit-tree</code> (<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/Pine.LNX.4.58.0504291416190.18901@ppc970.osdl.org/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com">this changed</a> a few weeks into the project, when everything started being prefixed with <code>git-</code>).</p><p>Some of them evolved into the plumbing commands that still exist to this day, like <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cat-file?ref=blog.gitbutler.com"><code>git cat-file</code></a> and <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-write-tree?ref=blog.gitbutler.com"><code>git write-tree</code></a>, others were fundamentally different (for example, <code>git read-tree</code> is a current Git plumbing command but the original <code>read-tree</code> was more like the current <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-ls-files?ref=blog.gitbutler.com" rel="noreferrer"><code>git ls-files</code></a>), however, at a low level the concepts all exist still.</p><p>Essentially, with the very first commit, Git could:</p><ul><li>Build up a “snapshot” by using <code>update-cache</code> to build a cache of contents (essentially a tarball), and <code>write-tree</code> to write it as an object to the database.</li><li>Write a "changeset" (commit) with <code>commit-tree</code> that commented on the changes introduced with a new tarball and the parent it was based on in order to setup a history of “tarballs”.</li><li>Read out those database structures with <code>cat-file</code> (pull an object out of the database), <code>read-tree</code> (list out what the cache looks like) and <code>show-diff</code> (show the diff of the cache to the working directory).</li></ul><p>From the very first days, Linus <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/Pine.LNX.4.58.0504170916080.7211@ppc970.osdl.org/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com">mentions</a> that he really only wanted to build this plumbing and have it be the backend for some UI (“porcelain”) be scripted on top of it. </p><blockquote>That was really what I always personally saw "git" as, just the plumbing beneath the surface. For example, something like arch, which is based on "patches and tar-balls" (I think darcs is similar in that respect), could use git as a _hell_ of a better "history of tar-balls". - Linus</blockquote><p>He meant to build an efficient tarball history database toolset, not really a version control system. He assumed that someone else would write that layer.</p><p>More on that in a minute. But first…</p><h2 id="scott-meets-git">Scott Meets Git</h2><p>I was personally first introduced to Git around this point in the timeline by my friend and coworker, Nick Hengeveld at the ill fated startup we both worked at called <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/khoyt/145320693?ref=blog.gitbutler.com" rel="noreferrer">Reactrix</a>.</p><figure><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/khoyt/145320693/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com" title="Metreon Reactrix by parkerkrhoyt, on Flickr"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/45/145320693_37fc0cc426_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Metreon Reactrix"></a><figcaption><p><span>Nick and I were in charge of getting the assets for these interactive ads to computers all over the country in malls and theaters.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>Interestingly, we used Git more in the way that Linus thought of the tools - as a distributed content tracker - rather than as the version control system that you probably mainly think of it as today.</p><p>We essentially worked for an advertising company that managed a bunch of digital signage displays with rather heavy-weight assets. Each of our hundreds of displays had a unique combination of ads they needed to run, most were on slow cell data uplinks, and the ads changed a lot. So we needed an efficient way to say “for machine A, we need ads 1, 2 and 3 (v1). for machine B, we need ads 2, 3 (v2) and 4” and incrementally update them if there were new versions of an existing ad.</p><p>We used Git - not to track changes in source code, but as a content distribution mechanism. We would use a script to look at the upcoming scheduling, write out unique trees of only the ads that each machine needed, commit that tree to a branch for the machine and then have each machine fetch and hard checkout every night.</p><p>This approach had a bunch of interesting advantages.</p><ul><li>If an ad updated, we only transferred the changed files and the changes were delta compressed against an object that was potentially already on the machine. </li><li>All the shared assets had a single blob that could be checked out in multiple contexts - the content addressable filesystem aspect of Git was great for this. </li><li>We could have thousands of combinations of hundreds of assets without storing any content twice anywhere or transferring the same thing over the network more than once.</li></ul><p>Nick was a fairly heavy contributor to the early Git project to get it to work for our use case (adding SSL support to http-fetch, adding resumable and parallel HTTP transfers, the first HTTP based push solution, etc). His <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/20050926175148.GA9410@reactrix.com/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com">first patch</a> was in September, a mere 6 months after Linus’s first commit.</p><p>His introduction of Git to me, my struggle to grasp it, and my eventual lightbulb moment of thinking it was pretty cool was what motivated me to write about it and try to make it easier for people to learn. </p><p>This pushed me to compile the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/d411cc4a0809051208k2a15c4a7te09a6979929e52f7@mail.gmail.com/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com">Git Community Book</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/pluralsight/git-internals-pdf?ref=blog.gitbutler.com">Git Internals Peepcode PDF</a>, build the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/d411cc4a0807251035i7aed2ec9wef7e8f1b3ae4c585@mail.gmail.com/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com" rel="noreferrer">git-scm.com website</a> and write the <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2?ref=blog.gitbutler.com">Pro Git book</a> - all of which eventually led me to GitHub.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gitbutler.com/content/images/2025/04/CleanShot-2025-04-05-at-08.30.42@2x.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1914" height="1520" srcset="https://blog.gitbutler.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/CleanShot-2025-04-05-at-08.30.42@2x.png 600w, https://blog.gitbutler.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/CleanShot-2025-04-05-at-08.30.42@2x.png 1000w, https://blog.gitbutler.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/04/CleanShot-2025-04-05-at-08.30.42@2x.png 1600w, https://blog.gitbutler.com/content/images/2025/04/CleanShot-2025-04-05-at-08.30.42@2x.png 1914w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>The version of git-scm.com that I first put up in 2008. It's a "blob" eating "trees".</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="git-lore">Git Lore</h2><p>So, how did this stupid content tracker become the most widely used SCM in the world?</p><p>Well, I go over a lot of the reasons I think Git and GitHub “won” in a <a href="https://blog.gitbutler.com/why-github-actually-won/">previous blog post</a>, but I do think it’s worth a quick glance at why Git itself ended up looking the way that it does today. Also maybe tell some fun anecdotes about the origins of stuff you know and love along the way.</p><p>As you may have deduced by the occasionally unfriendly, obscure or inconsistent nature of the Git commands, this wasn’t a system that someone sat down and meticulously designed from a usability standpoint from day one.</p><p>For the first several months, the git commands were all incredibly low level - even if you know the existing plumbing commands, you may not recognize a <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/20050601055833.GA14231@port.evillabs.net/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com">single one of the commands</a> that existed in June of 2005 (<code>rev-tree</code>, <code>mkdelta</code>, <code>tar-tree</code>?)</p><p>It was fairly clear from the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/200504141442.17235.elenstev@mesatop.com/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com">very beginning</a> that the approach was that Git would just be this very low level database/filesystem type toolset and that (possibly several) other tools would use Git as their infrastructure.</p><blockquote>Differentiating the SCM built on top of git from git itself is probably worthwhile to avoid confusion.  Other SCMs may be developed later, built on git, and these can come up with their own clever names. - <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/200504141442.17235.elenstev@mesatop.com/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com" rel="noreferrer">Steven Cole</a></blockquote><p>So if Linus and the early Git team didn’t initially imagine Git being an actual version control tool and just wanted to build the plumbing, where did the “porcelain“ commands that we know today actually come from?</p><p>The answer is that they sort of slowly eked their way in over several years, mostly as shell scripts that evolved to scratch a series of itches.</p><p>In the early days, there were a number of user interfaces that scripted Linus’s backend tooling to be more user friendly. The earliest and for the first few years the most popular was <code>git-pasky</code>, which quickly became “<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/20050414210120.GG22699@pasky.ji.cz/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com">Cogito</a>” by Petr Baudis. The first version of these scripts were released <a href="https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&amp;m=111315057710062&amp;w=2&amp;ref=blog.gitbutler.com">only days after Git</a>.</p><p>In <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/20050420205633.GC19112@pasky.ji.cz/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com" rel="noreferrer">early</a> <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/20050424005923.GA8859@pasky.ji.cz/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com" rel="noreferrer">release</a> <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/20050426032422.GQ13467@pasky.ji.cz/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com">announcements</a>, you can get a feeling for the tooling that would start to become Git.</p><p>A few months in, trying to keep the line between porcelain and plumbing <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/7vek9yirdi.fsf@assigned-by-dhcp.cox.net/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com">begins to break down</a> as tooling in git starts to compete with tooling in the porcelan scripts.</p><blockquote>This trend started when "git diff", "git commit" and friends were added for the sake of usability of the bare Plumbing. These basic commands are a must and I do not have any objection to have them in the "core GIT" suite, but at the same time I think the core should not be competing with Porcelains, and feel that a line should be drawn somewhere. - Junio</blockquote><p>Over the next year or two, more and more scripts continued to make their way into the core Git code until it eventually became clear that people’s time would be better spent working on the tools distributed with Git rather than trying to maintain this plumbing/porcelain distinction in the tooling. </p><p>In 2007, Cogito finally got “<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/git/20070419124648.GL4489@pasky.or.cz/?ref=blog.gitbutler.com">put up for sale</a>” and the idea of some other porcelain being the main way that Git was used was more or less abandoned.</p><p>Looking back through these commits and emails from 20 years ago, it’s fascinating to see the birth of some of the infamous tools that many of us use every day.</p><h3 id="the-first-git-log">The first <code>git log</code></h3><p>The <a href="https://github.com/git/git/commit/e764b8e8b3c50b131be825532ba26fa346d6586e?ref=blog.gitbutler.com" rel="noreferrer">first version</a> of <code>git log</code> was a wrapper script that called <code>git-rev-list --pretty</code>, piped it through a pager and was hard-coded to start at <code>HEAD</code>. Here is the original "git log" program in it's entirety:</p><pre><code>#!/bin/sh
 git-rev-list --pretty HEAD | LESS=-S ${PAGER:-less}

It still exists - you can still run <code spellcheck="false">git rev-list</code> in your project right now.</p></div><p>Actually, a <em>lot</em> of the current commands started out this way - a few lines long shell or Perl script that ran some core plumbing commands.

GitButler uses Git not only to do normal commits for tracking code changes, but also uses the git database to <a href="https://docs.gitbutler.com/features/timeline?ref=blog.gitbutler.com" rel="noreferrer">track the history of your project</a>. In the end, it's still a damn good stupid content tracker, as Linus first intended.</p><p>So, happy birthday Git. You are still weird. You are still wonderful. Thanks for all the fish.</p>
