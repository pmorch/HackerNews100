<p>It's been a bad couple of years for Microsoft's security and privacy efforts. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/10/microsoft-under-fire-for-response-to-leak-of-2-4tb-of-sensitive-customer-data/">Misconfigured endpoints</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/08/a-renegade-certificate-is-removed-from-windows-then-it-returns-confusion-ensues/">rogue security certificates</a>, and weak passwords have all caused or risked the exposure of sensitive data, and Microsoft has been criticized by security researchers, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/07/us-senator-blasts-microsoft-for-negligent-cybersecurity-practices/">US lawmakers</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/08/microsoft-cloud-security-blasted-for-its-culture-of-toxic-obfuscation/">regulatory agencies</a> for how it has responded to and disclosed these threats.</p>

<p>The most high-profile of these breaches involved a China-based hacking group named Storm-0558, which breached Microsoft's Azure service and collected data for over a month in mid-2023 before being discovered and driven out. After <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/07/microsoft-takes-pains-to-obscure-role-in-0-days-that-caused-email-breach/">months of ambiguity</a>, Microsoft disclosed that a series of security failures gave Storm-0558 access to an engineer's account, which allowed Storm-0558 to collect data from 25 of Microsoft's Azure customers, including US federal agencies.</p>
<p>In January, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/01/microsoft-network-breached-through-password-spraying-by-russian-state-hackers/">Microsoft disclosed that it had been breached again</a>, this time by Russian state-sponsored hacking group Midnight Blizzard. The group was able "to compromise a legacy non-production test tenant account" to gain access to Microsoft's systems for "as long as two months."</p>
<p>All of this culminated in a report (<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-04/CSRB_Review_of_the_Summer_2023_MEO_Intrusion_Final_508c.pdf">PDF</a>) from the US Cyber Safety Review Board, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/microsoft-blamed-for-a-cascade-of-security-failures-in-exchange-breach-report/">castigated</a> Microsoft for its "inadequate" security culture, its "inaccurate public statements," and its response to "preventable" security breaches.</p>
<p>To attempt to turn things around, Microsoft announced something it called the "<a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/11/02/secure-future-initiative-sfi-cybersecurity-cyberattacks/">Secure Future Initiative</a>" in November 2023. As part of that initiative, Microsoft today <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/05/03/security-above-all-else-expanding-microsofts-secure-future-initiative/">announced</a> a series of plans and changes to its security practices, including a few changes that have already been made.</p>
<p>"We are making security our top priority at Microsoft, above all else—over all other features," wrote Microsoft Security Executive Vice President Charlie Bell. "We’re expanding the scope of SFI, integrating the recent recommendations from the CSRB as well as our learnings from Midnight Blizzard to ensure that our cybersecurity approach remains robust and adaptive to the evolving threat landscape."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>As part of these changes, Microsoft will also make its Senior Leadership Team's pay partially dependent on whether the company is "meeting our security plans and milestones," though Bell didn't specify how much executive pay would be dependent on meeting those security goals.</p>
<p>Microsoft's post describes three security principles ("secure by design," "secure by default," and "secure operations") and six "security pillars" meant to address different weaknesses in Microsoft's systems and development practices. The company says it plans to secure 100 percent of all its user accounts with "securely managed, phishing-resistant multifactor authentication," enforce least-privilege access across all applications and user accounts, improve network monitoring and isolation, and retain all system security logs for at least two years, among other promises. Microsoft is also planning to put new deputy Chief Information Security Officers on different engineering teams to track their progress and report back to the executive team and board of directors.</p>
<p>As for concrete fixes that Microsoft has already implemented, Bell writes that Microsoft has "implemented automatic enforcement of multifactor authentication by default across more than 1 million Microsoft Entra ID tenants within Microsoft," removed 730,000 old and/or insecure apps "to date across production and corporate tenants," expanded its security logging, and adopted the <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2024/04/toward-greater-transparency-adopting-the-cwe-standard-for-microsoft-cves/">Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standard</a> for its security disclosures.</p>
<p>In addition to Bell's public security promises, The Verge has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24148033/satya-nadella-microsoft-security-memo">obtained and published an internal memo</a> from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella that re-emphasizes the company's publicly stated commitment to security. Nadella also says that improving security should be prioritized over adding new features, something that may affect the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/microsoft-commits-to-updating-windows-11-once-per-year-and-also-all-the-time/">constant stream of tweaks and changes</a> that Microsoft releases for Windows 11 and other software.</p>
<p>"The recent findings by the Department of Homeland Security’s Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB) regarding the Storm-0558 cyberattack, from summer 2023, underscore the severity of the threats facing our company and our customers, as well as our responsibility to defend against these increasingly sophisticated threat actors," writes Nadella. "If you’re faced with the tradeoff between security and another priority, your answer is clear: <strong>Do security</strong>. In some cases, this will mean prioritizing security above other things we do, such as releasing new features or providing ongoing support for legacy systems."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><em><span>Welcome to BIG, a newsletter on the politics of monopoly power. If you’d like to sign up to receive issues over email, you can do so </span><a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/subscribe" rel="">here</a><span>.</span></em></p><p>I’m at the Google antitrust closing arguments, and I’ll have some thoughts on that soon. But today’s piece is about some bombshell evidence that just came out on a giant post-Covid conspiracy in the oil industry. And I do mean giant, because there’s now evidence that price-fixingp in the oil industry alone may single-handedly be responsible for a little over a quarter of the total inflationary increase in 2021.</p><p>Let’s dive in.</p><p><span>Last Sunday, I wrote </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/monopoly-round-up-inflation-re-accelerating" rel="">a piece</a><span> alleging that U.S. shale oil producers colluded with the Saudi government from 2021-2023 to drive up gas prices. That essay was based on some reporting I had done, as well as a </span><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/6kg5nqpr3uxakc41bmywz/pm-53123561_complaint.pdf?rlkey=lvmfvw5cjz67kwu2hc1rbk8q8&amp;dl=0" rel="">complaint</a><span> from a savvy Kansas City class action law firm, </span><a href="https://sharplawllp.com/" rel="">Sharp Law</a><span>, with special expertise in oil. The theory was that American producers, after a bitter price war from 2014-2016, got tired of competing on price with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or the OPEC oil cartel, and at some point from 2017-2021, decided to join the cartel and cut supply to the market. This action had the affect of raising oil prices, costing oil consumers something on the order of $200 billion a year.</span></p><p><span>Yesterday, the Federal Trade Commission </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/05/ftc-order-bans-former-pioneer-ceo-exxon-board-seat-exxon-pioneer-deal" rel="">released evidence</a><span> confirming that collusion played a serious role in hiking oil prices at that time. Pioneer Natural Resources CEO Scott Sheffield, a leader in the fracking field, “exchanged hundreds of text messages with OPEC representatives and officials discussing crude oil market dynamics, pricing and output.” Sheffield was explicit about his goal, saying that “if Texas leads the way, maybe we can get OPEC to cut production. Maybe Saudi and Russia will follow. That was our plan,” he said, adding: “I was using the tactics of OPEC+ to get a bigger OPEC+ done.” He talked to shareholders, publicly threatened rivals, and ultimately achieved output cuts across the industry regardless of price. “Even if oil gets to $200/barrel,” he said, “the independent producers are going to be disciplined.”</span></p><p>By 2021, as the economy roared back from Covid, the independents had joined OPEC. “I don’t think the world can rely much on US shale,” Sheffield said. “It’s really under OPEC control.” </p><p><span>There’s more about Sheffield in the FTC complaint, though </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/2410004exxonpioneercomplaintredacted.pdf" rel="">a lot is redacted</a><span>. Investment data bears out what the FTC found, with lower production despite variations in price.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F702b677d-8b2b-458b-925c-66b1edeef5d0_765x415.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F702b677d-8b2b-458b-925c-66b1edeef5d0_765x415.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F702b677d-8b2b-458b-925c-66b1edeef5d0_765x415.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F702b677d-8b2b-458b-925c-66b1edeef5d0_765x415.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F702b677d-8b2b-458b-925c-66b1edeef5d0_765x415.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F702b677d-8b2b-458b-925c-66b1edeef5d0_765x415.png" width="765" height="415" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/702b677d-8b2b-458b-925c-66b1edeef5d0_765x415.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:415,&quot;width&quot;:765,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F702b677d-8b2b-458b-925c-66b1edeef5d0_765x415.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F702b677d-8b2b-458b-925c-66b1edeef5d0_765x415.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F702b677d-8b2b-458b-925c-66b1edeef5d0_765x415.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F702b677d-8b2b-458b-925c-66b1edeef5d0_765x415.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>How much did this conspiracy cost the consumer? “We produced too much oil and competed with OPEC,” Sheffield </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/2410004exxonpioneercomplaintredacted.pdf" rel="">said</a><span> in 2023. “We actually lowered the price by $20 to $30 per barrel over the past 10 years to the detriment of losing our entire investor base.” </span></p><p><span>Since the U.S. consumes</span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=33&amp;t=6#:~:text=EIA%20uses%20product%20supplied%20to,7.3%20billion%20barrels%20of%20petroleum." rel=""> 7 billion barrels of oil</a><span> annually, the amount saved by shale oil drillers during their price war with OPEC was $140 billion to $210 billion a year. Once that price war ended, presumably so did the savings. The cost itself is likely a lot higher because pulling shale off the market when demand spiked probably caused prices to increase by much more than $20-30 a barrel. Anyway, we’re talking $500-1000 dollars of extra cost per year to Americans through direct and indirect effects of this conspiracy. This cost shows up most obviously in the form of more expensive gas, but higher oil prices increase the price of everything right down to potato chips because of gas being a primary cost in distribution of goods and services. For a family of four, that’s two to four thousand dollars a year in higher costs.</span></p><p><span>With these kinds of numbers, it’s likely this conspiracy had macro-economic impacts.

The conduct the FTC found is a conspiracy that violates price-fixing law, and the commission should be bringing a charge on that basis, not necessarily based on merger law. Plaintiff lawyers are </span><em>already </em><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/6kg5nqpr3uxakc41bmywz/pm-53123561_complaint.pdf?rlkey=lvmfvw5cjz67kwu2hc1rbk8q8&amp;dl=0" rel="">bringing</a><span> price-fixing claims here, and the FTC action just made that case far more likely to draw blood. </span></p><p><span>There’s also the politics, as these oil mergers are highly contested and partisan. Democrats are skeptical of “Big Oil,” while the Republican coalition is built around fossil fuel firms, Wall Street private equity who finance it, and Saudi wealth that benefits from expensive oil. Late last year, 21 Senate Democrats asked the FTC to challenge this spate of oil and gas mergers. Then, a few month ago, 37 Senate Republicans, led by Texas Senator Ted Cruz, </span><a href="https://www.capito.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/03-27-2024_commerce_ftc_oil_and_gas_mergers_letter.pdf" rel="">sent a letter</a><span> demanding the FTC stay out of the industry’s merger spree, as that merger spree would, in their view, raise production. </span></p><p><span>Within the commission, it was obviously a big deal. The settlement from the FTC kicking Sheffield off the board was a 3-2 commission vote that similarly broke down on party lines. FTC Chair </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/public-statements/statement-chair-lina-m-khan-matter-exxon-mobil-corporation" rel="">Lina Khan</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/public-statements/concurring-statement-commissioner-alvaro-m-bedoya-matter-exxonmobil-copioneer-natural-resource-co" rel="">Commissioners Alvaro Bedoya</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/public-statements/concurring-statement-commissioner-rebecca-kelly-slaughter-matter-exxonmobil-corp" rel="">Rebecca Kelly Slaughter</a><span> all issued separate statements, whereas Republicans Andrew Ferguson and Melissa Holyoak issued a </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/2410004exxonpioneermh-afstmt.pdf" rel="">joint dissent</a><span>. Everyone agreed that the conduct of Sheffield was concerning, and Slaughter, Holyoak, and Ferguson called for a potential price-fixing suit. </span></p><p><span>Ferguson and Holyoak argued the merger itself was fine, and the board position had nothing to do with the combination. There was an odd bit where they lauded Exxon’s ‘wise’ decision to not put Sheffield on the board. Bedoya, in his statement, rebutted this by </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/2410004exxonpioneerambstmt_0.pdf" rel="">pointing</a><span> out that Exxon was going to put Sheffield on its board until the FTC acted. Khan’s argument was simple; when executives say they are trying to collude, regulators should have ‘regulatory humility’ and believe them.</span></p><p>At any rate, this decision is a bit of a muddle. An oil CEO, a legend and decision-maker in the industry, got personally punished for price-fixing. That’s good. But a big merger went through, though it is relatively small in the global context. Still, the muddle is inherent, as there’s just no way to fix a harm that was so vast and far-reaching. </p><p>So what happens now? Well fortunately there already is a private antitrust price-fixing suit, and it just got a huge boost from the FTC’s release of its complaint. That means years of litigation against not just Pioneer but seven different shale oil producers. Additionally, the FTC could bring actual monopolization claims against the shale producers, but that’s probably contingent upon a second Biden term, an uncertain proposition. And even with that possibility, we’re going to run into the same problem we see with all of antitrust, which is that it takes forever.</p><p>Finally, there’s also likely to be some sort of political reaction, considering it’s an election year, and this is pretty good evidence that oil firms helped collude with Saudi Arabia to steal thousands of dollars from each American family.  I can see Congressional proposals to fund oil-specific antitrust investigations, special rules proposed to prohibit communications with OPEC, or even pushing the Federal Reserve to start looking into the relationship between price-fixing and inflation. In 2022, the Biden administration pleaded with oil firms to invest in drilling more to bring down the price of oil, but they refused, claiming it was Biden environmental policies that were the cause of their low investment. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d2a3634-3f5e-4bba-bbc9-2b525a698d85_1092x597.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d2a3634-3f5e-4bba-bbc9-2b525a698d85_1092x597.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d2a3634-3f5e-4bba-bbc9-2b525a698d85_1092x597.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d2a3634-3f5e-4bba-bbc9-2b525a698d85_1092x597.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d2a3634-3f5e-4bba-bbc9-2b525a698d85_1092x597.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d2a3634-3f5e-4bba-bbc9-2b525a698d85_1092x597.png" width="1092" height="597" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8d2a3634-3f5e-4bba-bbc9-2b525a698d85_1092x597.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:597,&quot;width&quot;:1092,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:593947,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d2a3634-3f5e-4bba-bbc9-2b525a698d85_1092x597.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d2a3634-3f5e-4bba-bbc9-2b525a698d85_1092x597.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d2a3634-3f5e-4bba-bbc9-2b525a698d85_1092x597.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d2a3634-3f5e-4bba-bbc9-2b525a698d85_1092x597.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The environmental constraints bit was in retrospect an obvious lie.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
	<p><span><span>W</span></span>hen Maureen Amirault purchased her first electric wheelchair in 2020, she had been living with muscular dystrophy for decades. Braces and a cane helped, but walking became too arduous, so she got a chair through a company called Numotion.</p>
<p>The first few months were great. The headrest fell off, but Numotion fixed it in a matter of days.</p>
<p>“That was my expectation moving forward,” said the lifelong Connecticut resident. “But for the past three years, I’ve never been without a repair issue, and I’ve usually had multiple repair issues.”</p>
<p>Amirault hasn’t had a properly fitting footplate since she got the wheelchair. She was improperly fitted at the start, but didn’t know that her feet shouldn’t be dangling. Three years later — after dozens of texts, calls and emails with Numotion and even a personal letter to the CEO — Amirault’s footplate is still faulty.</p>
<p>“I’m putting all my weight on my ankles. My feet are, like, turning in and my bones are deforming. I have custom shoes, but I can’t even put those on because the foot is so curved,” she said.</p>
<p>Protracted waits to get a wheelchair fixed are common for the over 5 million wheelchair users nationwide. In Connecticut, consumers <a href="https://cga.ct.gov/hs/tfs/20230727_Wheelchair%20Repair%20Task%20Force/20231102/NCART%20Industry%20Presentation%20to%20CT%20Working%20Group%20Final%2011-01-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wait, on </a><a href="https://cga.ct.gov/hs/tfs/20230727_Wheelchair%20Repair%20Task%20Force/20231102/NCART%20Industry%20Presentation%20to%20CT%20Working%20Group%20Final%2011-01-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">average, nearly two months</a>. Unfortunately, they are out of options as wheelchair repair technicians are highly specialized.&nbsp;And after buying up smaller, mom-and-pop repair shops over the last decade, private-equity-owned Numotion and National Seating &amp; Mobility (NSM) <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2022/05/motorized-wheelchairs-numotion-national-seating-mobility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dominate the country’s wheelchair landscape</a>. They are also key figures in the $60 billion durable medical equipment industry, according to <a href="https://pestakeholder.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PESP_Report_DME_2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent report by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project</a>, a non-profit group that seeks to shed light on the impact of private equity on the health care industry, among other sectors.</p>
		
		
<p>The two behemoths have both been owned by <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2022/03/24/private-equity-health-care-profits-time-to-protect-patients/">private equity companies</a> for over a decade but both got new PE owners in recent years. AEA Investors <a href="https://www.numotion.com/about-us/news/aea-investors-lp-acquires-numotion-the-nation-s-l" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bought Numotion</a> in 2018, and <a href="https://www.cinven.com/media/news/cinven-to-invest-in-national-seating-mobility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cinven bought NSM</a> in 2019. Wheelchair users in Connecticut say these purchases have coincided with a decline in service.</p>
<p>Executives at both companies say they don’t have the money to hire more people to expedite repairs and shorten wait times. However, both companies had millions of dollars in annual profits during the last few years, according to financial estimates from the research firm PrivCo.</p>
<p>“What we’re talking about is access to essential medical equipment that allows people to be independent and, in some cases, get out of bed. It is really problematic that the companies would claim that it’s not possible to hire more people when their profits are quite rich,” said Sheldon Toubman, an attorney for Disability Rights Connecticut.</p>
<p>This push from disability advocates is part of a nationwide surge to secure better service for wheelchair users — especially since companies make more money selling new chairs than repairing them. Colorado recently passed a bill that <a href="https://dailymontanan.com/2023/10/08/despite-a-right-to-repair-law-theres-no-easy-fix-for-wheelchair-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allows wheelchair users to repair their own chairs</a>, and <a href="https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/2024/02/12/legislature-edges-toward-passage-of-right-to-repair-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other</a> <a href="https://www.dailyrepublic.com/news/dodd-introduces-wheelchair-repair-legislation/article_cc98267e-d026-11ee-9c6a-b30dbedf4b0e.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">states</a>, <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2024/01/04/wheelchair-warranty-senate-bill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including Massachusetts</a>, are eyeing similar measures.</p>
<p>“These are not isolated stories, these are common issues that people [across the country] are having, and there is a tremendous amount of frustration among wheelchair users,” says Amy Scherer, a senior staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network and a wheelchair user.</p>
<p>In Connecticut, a bipartisan task force on this issue recently published a <a href="https://cga.ct.gov/hs/tfs/20230727_Wheelchair%20Repair%20Task%20Force/Final%20Report/SA%2023-22%20Wheelchair%20Repair%20Task%20Force%20Final%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> outlining several recommendations, and Connecticut legislators have an opportunity to make some of these suggestions permanent before the legislative session ends on May 8. For the state’s approximately 6,500 wheelchair users, waiting has consequences.</p>
<p>“[They] said the cost is too much for them to bear,” said Amirault, referring to the reasoning the wheelchair makers offered lawmakers. “But the cost of them not [doing] it is too much for us to bear.”</p>
<h2><strong>The cost of long repair times</strong></h2>
<p>Customized wheelchairs typically last five years, but most chairs <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33845000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">need a major repair or two during that time</a>. Electric wheelchairs, or power chairs, are a technological marvel, meticulously designed from hub to seat to deliver power and maneuverability so the user can roam as needed, while also supporting and cushioning their body for potentially an entire day.</p>
<p>To get such a chair, a person needs a prescription, authorization from their insurance company, and a custom fitting from an assistive technology professional. Like a tailor crafting an exquisite suit, these technicians meticulously measure a client’s body to ensure the device’s specifications will match.</p>
<p>“Wheelchairs are a very personal thing. We consider them to be part of our body, and when they’re not working, we’re not working our best,” said Cathy Ludlum, a disability consultant and wheelchair user in Manchester, Conn. “It’s almost like having a relationship with a doctor or a really good mechanic. You’d like to know that when something is wrong, they will be there for you. Sadly, that’s not what’s happening any more.”</p>
		
		
<p>A recent survey suggests the extended wait times are a widespread problem. Disability advocates conducted an informal survey that found that over <a href="https://cga.ct.gov/hs/tfs/20230727_Wheelchair%20Repair%20Task%20Force/Final%20Report/SA%2023-22%20Wheelchair%20Repair%20Task%20Force%20Final%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">75% of consumers waited at least a month for a repair</a>. Companies often provide loaner wheelchairs to help users get around, but they rarely fit as well. Industry experts from the National Coalition for Assistive &amp; Rehab Technology (NCART) gave a <a href="https://cga.ct.gov/hs/tfs/20230727_Wheelchair%20Repair%20Task%20Force/20231102/NCART%20Industry%20Presentation%20to%20CT%20Working%20Group%20Final%2011-01-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presentation</a> last year that showed in-home repairs took roughly two months. All this waiting has consequences for wheelchair users.</p>
<p>In 2021, Ludlum’s power chair frequently got stuck and couldn’t move. If there wasn’t anyone nearby to restart her chair, she would simply have to wait, often for hours. It took seven months for NSM to fix her chair.</p>
<p>Seven months of increased stillness sapped the strength in her hands. Ludlum, who has spinal muscular atrophy, stopped being able to reliably lift her finger off the light beam, which stops the chair. One day she couldn’t stop her chair, which then crashed into her living room couch and almost flipped over.</p>
<p>“It’s really scary when you can’t make your wheelchair go,” she said. “But it’s twice as scary when you can’t make it stop.”</p>
<p>Ludlum, 62, is quick to point out that the chair wasn’t responsible for the crash. But the experience was so harrowing that she now uses a manual wheelchair and relies on other people to push her. Years of declining service from NSM also make her reluctant to return to her old chair, which sits still in the hallway now.</p>
<h2><strong>Data undercut industry claims of financial hardship</strong></h2>
<p>While disability advocates see the wheelchair repair system as newly flawed, NCART Executive Director Wayne Grau said the dysfunction is baked in. Neither company replied to a request for comment and instead nominated Grau to speak on their behalf.</p>
<p>“For 30 years, the repair process has been inefficient at best,” he said. “Covid broke it with supply chain issues and with labor issues.”</p>
<p>Numotion Executive Vice President of the East Division Gary Gilberti blamed financial constraints at a Connecticut legislative task force meeting in November. He said, “I get the solution is more people, but that’s economically not possible.”</p>
<p>That narrative of financial hardship does not square with what STAT was able to find out about the financial health of both the companies. Numotion has taken home at least $90 million in profits in each of the last three years, according to estimates from PrivCo. NSM has been clearing at least $55 million each year. When asked about this data, Grau said that he was “not privy to those numbers” and reiterated that it was a “capital-intensive business.”</p>
<p>Industry leaders say that the keys to improving service are freeing up the supply chain, removing insurance prior authorization and getting through the pandemic repair backlog, which is significant. As of November, Numotion had 740 outstanding service orders for 622 customers and NSM had 687 for 445 customers. The companies did not offer data on the pre-pandemic backlog for comparison. However, Diane Racicot, NSM vice president of payer relations, undercut the idea that the supply chain is partly to blame, <a href="https://cga.ct.gov/hs/tfs/20230727_Wheelchair%20Repair%20Task%20Force/Final%20Report/SA%2023-22%20Wheelchair%20Repair%20Task%20Force%20Final%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saying during a December task force meeting</a>, “well over two-thirds of our backlog — parts are in, and we’re trying to get them out the door.”</p>
		
		
<p>In the wake of the task force report, the two companies promised to hire three additional technicians in Connecticut. According to Grau, they have both hired two and are both “looking for their third one.” Grau also said that wait times have improved in recent months, but when asked to share data, he did not answer the question.</p>
<p>Connecticut state Rep. Jillian Gilchrest recently toured the NSM warehouse in Newington and saw a cavernous room filled to the brim with roughly 200 wheelchairs, most of them waiting for repairs. Then she looked at the pictures on the wall of the staff. There were only six or eight people, and one of those workers had just left the company.</p>
<p>“I’m not a mathematician, but that’s not that much staff. Why can’t you hire more? Two hundred wheelchairs is a lot of wheelchairs,” she said.</p>
<p>Gilchrist says the script is all too familiar. As the human services committee chair in the state House of Representatives, she has watched <a href="https://ctmirror.org/2024/03/07/ct-health-care-private-equity-investment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other industries like nursing homes become dominated by private equity</a>.</p>
<p>“It’s hard for me to hear that argument ‘we don’t have the money’ when their profits are so high,” she said. “I’d like to see national companies like that restructure how much they pay folks at the top and redirect some of that money towards staffing the technicians who do the everyday work.”</p>
<p>Most people on the task force agreed that changes needed to be made, but Gilchrist concedes that the state’s “<a href="https://ctmirror.org/2024/02/12/ct-fiscal-guardrails-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fiscal guardrails</a>” will likely water down any legislation.</p>
<p>Grau wants more wheelchair users to come into the shop, as repairs happen much faster — only two week’s wait, on average. Wheelchair users are loath to adopt this, as coming into the office can be physically treacherous for them and they would have to pay for transit. Gilchrest hopes that next year the task force can put some money into this issue, like fund paratransit to the repair shops.</p>
<p>Until then, Ludlum will be relying on her manual wheelchair to get around. Her world is smaller now. She can no longer visit her garden by herself, and it’s harder for her to hang out with older friends, some of whom can’t push her. She doesn’t want these subpar mobility options to close her off from loved ones, especially given the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10357115/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative effects of social isolation</a>.</p>
<p>“Wheelchairs and power chairs in particular make us more functional. We need to be able to move. We need to be able to go out and do things and be independent as much as we can,” she said.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Two years ago, sodium-ion battery pioneer Natron Energy was busy <a href="https://newatlas.com/energy/natron-sodium-ion-battery-production/" data-cms-ai="0">preparing its specially formulated sodium batteries</a> for mass production. The company slipped a little past its 2023 kickoff plans, but it didn't fall too far behind as far as mass battery production goes. It officially commenced production of its rapid-charging, long-life lithium-free sodium batteries this week, bringing to market an intriguing new alternative in the energy storage game. </p><p>Not only is sodium somewhere between 500 to 1,000 times more abundant than lithium on the planet we call Earth, sourcing it doesn't necessitate the same type of earth-scarring extraction. Even moving beyond the sodium vs lithium surname comparison, Natron says its sodium-ion batteries are made entirely from abundantly available commodity materials that also include aluminum, iron and manganese. </p><p>Furthermore, the materials for Natron's sodium-ion chemistry can be procured through a reliable US-based domestic supply chain free from geopolitical disruption. The same cannot be said for common lithium-ion materials like cobalt and nickel. </p><p>Sodium-ion tech has received heightened interest in recent years as a more reliable, potentially <a href="https://newatlas.com/sodium-ion-battery-cheaper-lithium/51682/" data-cms-ai="0">cheaper</a> energy storage medium. While its energy density lags behind lithium-ion, advantages such as faster cycling, longer lifespan and safer, non-flammable end use have made sodium-ion an attractive alternative, especially for stationary uses like data center and EV charger backup storage. </p><p>Founded in 2013, Natron has been one of the pioneers in this new wave of sodium-ion research and innovation. And while most sodium-ion designs remain in the laboratory, Natron has switched on one of the first major production operations globally. It celebrated the official production kick-off earlier this week with a ribbon-cutting ceremony at its Holland, Michigan manufacturing facility, calling it the first-ever commercial-scale production of sodium-ion batteries in the US. </p><p>"Sodium-ion batteries offer a unique alternative to lithium-ion, with higher power, faster recharge, longer lifecycle and a completely safe and stable chemistry," Natron founder and co-CEO Colin Wessells said at the event. "The electrification of our economy is dependent on the development and production of new, innovative energy storage solutions.

            </div><p>Natron says its batteries charge and discharge at rates 10 times faster than lithium-ion, a level of immediate charge/discharge capability that makes the batteries a prime contender for the ups and downs of backup power storage. Also helping in that use case is an estimated lifespan of 50,000 cycles. </p><p>We haven't seen a weight-based energy density figure from Natron itself, but a 2022 article from <i><a href="https://cen.acs.org/business/inorganic-chemicals/Sodium-comes-battery-world/100/i19" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">Chemical &amp; Engineering News</a></i> put its sodium-ion batteries at 70 Wh/kg, around the very bottom of the sodium-ion energy density scale. That aligns well with the company's stationary-only business plan, as sodium-ion batteries being pursued for potential mobility use have more than double that density. CATL showed a <a href="https://newatlas.com/energy/chinese-giant-catl-commercial-salt-based-battery/" data-cms-ai="0">160 Wh/kg sodium-ion battery</a> in 2021 and has plans to increase that density over 200 Wh/kg to better meet the needs of electric vehicles. </p><p>Natron's plans call for the Holland facility to crank production up to 600 megawatts annually at full tilt, serving as a model for future gigawatt-scale facilities. In the two years since we last looked at Natron's plans, AI has grown a <a href="https://newatlas.com/technology/elon-musk-ai/" data-cms-ai="0">whole lot more power-hungry</a> so it's not surprising  the company's initial target is AI data storage centers, where it's fast-cycling batteries could become an essential power management tool.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
<p>My goal with this bookmarkable guide is to provide a list of (frankly: incredible) new additions to CSS lately. There is no hardline criteria for this list other than that these things are all <em>fairly</em> new and my sense is that many people aren’t aware of these things. Or even if they are, they don’t have a great understanding of them and could use a <strong>plain language</strong> explanation of what it is, <em>why they should care</em>, and a bit of reference code. Maybe that’s you.</p>



<p>I’d like to work on our collective muscle memory on these features. <a href="https://twitter.com/chriscoyier/status/1757826338722058444">Like I said</a>, “even if you <em>know</em> about this stuff, it takes time to build the muscle memory around it.”</p>



<p>There is quite a bit more syntax, detail, and nuance to these things than I am presenting here. I want you to know what’s possible, reference the most basic usage and syntax, then dig deeper when you need to. </p>

<h2 id="toc-1">Container Queries <span>(Size)</span></h2>



<h3 id="toc-2">What are Size Container Queries?</h3>



<p>Container Queries allow you to write styles that apply to the children of a container element when that container matches certain media conditions, typically a width measurement.</p>



<div>
<div><pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-1" data-shcb-language-name="HTML, XML" data-shcb-language-slug="xml"><span><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"element-wrap"</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"element"</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></code></span><small id="shcb-language-1"><span>Code language:</span> <span>HTML, XML</span> <span>(</span><span>xml</span><span>)</span></small></pre></div>



<div><pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-2" data-shcb-language-name="CSS" data-shcb-language-slug="css"><span><code><span>.element-wrap</span> {

  <span>.element</span> {

  }
}</code></span><small id="shcb-language-2"><span>Code language:</span> <span>CSS</span> <span>(</span><span>css</span><span>)</span></small></pre></div>
</div>



<h3 id="toc-3">When should you care?</h3>



<p>If you’ve ever thought: I wish I could make styling decisions based on the size of <em>this</em> element, not the entire page like <code>@media</code> queries force me to do. Then using <code>@container</code> queries are for you! People who work on design systems or heavily component-based websites will probably <em>mostly</em> use Container Queries to style things based on size, because the size of the entire page is a poor proxy for the size of a component. </p>

<h2 id="toc-6">Container Queries <span>(Style)</span></h2>



<h3 id="toc-7">What are Style Container Queries?</h3>



<p>Container Style Queries allow you to apply styles when a given Custom Property has a given value. </p>

<h3 id="toc-8">When should you care?</h3>



<p>Have you ever wanted a mixin in CSS? As in, you set one property but get multiple properties. <a href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin/">Sass made mixins</a> fairly popular. You can do that with a Style Container Query. But just like how Sass had variables then CSS variables turned out to be more powerful and useful, Style Container Queries are likely to be more powerful and useful, because they respect the cascade and can be calculated and such.</p>

<h2 id="toc-11">Container Units</h2>



<h3 id="toc-12">What are Container Units?</h3>



<p>Container Units (literally units, like <code>px</code>, <code>rem</code>, or <code>vw</code>) allow you to set the size of things based on the current size of a container element. Similar to how with viewport units <code>1vw</code> is 1% of the browser window width, <code>1cqw</code> is 1% of the width of the container (although I’d recommend you use <code>cqi</code> instead, the “logical equivalent”, meaning the “inline direction”).</p>



<p>The units are <code>cqw</code> (“container query width”), <code>cqh</code> (“container query height”), <code>cqi</code> (“container query inline”), <code>cqb</code> (“container query block”), <code>cqmin</code> (smaller of <code>cqi</code> and <code>cqb</code>), and <code>cqmax</code> (larger of <code>cqi</code> and <code>cqb</code>).</p>



<h3 id="toc-13">When should you care?</h3>



<p>If the sizing of anything in an element feels as if it should be based on the current size of the container, container units are essentially the only way. An example of this is typography. A typical Card element may deserve a larger header text when it happens to be rendered larger, without something like a class name needing to be added to control that. (I’m a fan of <a href="https://codepen.io/scottkellum/details/jOwmOZE">this demo</a>.) Even a container query is clunky comparatively.</p>

<h3 id="toc-15">Basic Demo of Usage</h3>



<p>This element uses container query units for not only the <code>font-size</code>, but the <code>padding</code>, <code>border</code>, and <code>margin</code> as well.</p>

<div>
<h2 id="toc-16">The <code>:has()</code> Pseudo Selector</h2>



<h3 id="toc-17">What is the <code>:has()</code> selector?</h3>



<p>The <code>:has()</code> selector allows you to conditionally select an element when elements deeper in the DOM tree of the original element match the selector you put inside <code>:has()</code>. </p>


<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-4" data-shcb-language-name="CSS" data-shcb-language-slug="css"><span><code><span>figure</span><span>:has(figcaption)</span> {
  <span>border</span>: <span>1px</span> solid black;
  <span>padding</span>: <span>0.5rem</span>;
}</code></span><small id="shcb-language-4"><span>Code language:</span> <span>CSS</span> <span>(</span><span>css</span><span>)</span></small></pre>


<h3 id="toc-18">When should you care?</h3>



<p>If you’ve ever wanted a “parent” selector in CSS, <code>:has()</code> can do that, but it’s more powerful than that, as once you’ve selected the parent you want, you can again drill back down. Jhey Tompkins once called it <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/has-m105/">a “family selector”</a> which a nice way to think about it. You can also combine it with <code>:not()</code> to build a selector when an element <em>doesn’t </em>“have” a matching element inside.</p>

<div>
<h2 id="toc-21">View Transitions</h2>



<h3 id="toc-22">What are View Transitions?</h3>



<p>There are two types of View Transitions:</p>



<ol>
<li>Same-Page Transitions (Require JavaScript)</li>



<li>Multi-Page Transitions (CSS Only)</li>
</ol>



<p>They are both useful. A same-page transition involves and animation when the DOM is changed without the page changing, like a list being sorted. A multi-page transition is for animating elements between page loads, like a video thumbnail transitioning into a video element. This is the basic syntax for a same-page transition:</p>


<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-5" data-shcb-language-name="JavaScript" data-shcb-language-slug="javascript"><span><code><span>if</span> (!<span>document</span>.startViewTransition) {
  updateTheDOM();
} <span>else</span> {
  <span>document</span>.startViewTransition(<span><span>()</span> =&gt;</span> updateTheDOM());
}</code></span><small id="shcb-language-5"><span>Code language:</span> <span>JavaScript</span> <span>(</span><span>javascript</span><span>)</span></small></pre>


<p>For multi-page transitions: you need this meta tag:</p>


<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-6" data-shcb-language-name="HTML, XML" data-shcb-language-slug="xml"><span><code><span>&lt;<span>meta</span> <span>name</span>=<span>"view-transition"</span> <span>content</span>=<span>"same-origin"</span>&gt;</span></code></span><small id="shcb-language-6"><span>Code language:</span> <span>HTML, XML</span> <span>(</span><span>xml</span><span>)</span></small></pre>


<p>Then any element you want to transition between pages you make sure has a totally unique <code>view-transition-name</code> applied in the styles, on both the outgoing page and incoming page. </p>



<h3 id="toc-23">When should you care?</h3>



<p>Users can understand an interface better if an element moves to a new position rather than instantly being there. There is an animation concept called <em>tweening</em> where the animation is automatically created based on a starting and ending state. View Transitions are essentially tweening. You can control aspects of the animation, but for the most part the animation is automatically created based on the starting and ending state of the DOM, rather than you having to be really specific about the animation details.</p>

<div>
<h2 id="toc-26">Nesting</h2>



<h3 id="toc-27">What is nesting?</h3>



<p>Nesting is a way of writing CSS that allow you to write additional selectors within an existing <strong>ruleset</strong>.  </p>


<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-7" data-shcb-language-name="CSS" data-shcb-language-slug="css"><span><code><span><span><span>.card</span> {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>padding</span>: <span>1rem</span>;
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><mark><span>  &gt; h2:first-child {
</span></mark><span><span>    <span>margin-block-start</span>: <span>0</span>;
</span></span><span><span>  }
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><mark><span>  <span>footer</span> {
</span></mark><span><span>    <span>border-block-start</span>: <span>1px</span> solid black;
</span></span><span><span>  }
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></span><small id="shcb-language-7"><span>Code language:</span> <span>CSS</span> <span>(</span><span>css</span><span>)</span></small></pre>


<h3 id="toc-28">When should you care?</h3>



<p>Nesting is mostly a CSS authoring convenience, but the fact that it can group related CSS nicely together and prevent you from having to repeat writing a selector can mean avoiding mistakes and making the CSS easier to read. Nested CSS can also be something of a footgun in that may encourage writing CSS that matches the nesting of HTML in an unnecessary way, increasing the specificity and decreasing the reusability of some CSS. </p>


<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-8" data-shcb-language-name="CSS" data-shcb-language-slug="css"><span><code><span><span><span>.card</span> {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>container</span>: card / inline-size;
</span></span><span><span>  
</span></span><span><span>  <span>display</span>: grid;
</span></span><span><span>  <span>gap</span>: <span>1rem</span>;
</span></span><span><span>  
</span></span><mark><span>  @container (<span>min-inline-size</span>: <span>250px</span>) {
</span></mark><span><span>    gap: <span>2rem</span>;
</span></span><span><span>  }
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></span><small id="shcb-language-8"><span>Code language:</span> <span>CSS</span> <span>(</span><span>css</span><span>)</span></small></pre>


<p>The only major difference from Sass-style nesting is that you can’t combine the <code>&amp;</code> directly. </p>


<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-9" data-shcb-language-name="CSS" data-shcb-language-slug="css"><span><code><span>.card</span> {
  body.home &amp; { <span>/* totally fine */</span> }
  &amp; <span>.footer</span> { <span>/* totally fine, don't even need the &amp; */</span>

<h2 id="toc-30">Scroll-Driven Animations</h2>



<h3 id="toc-31">What are Scroll-Driven Animations?</h3>



<p>Any animation that is tied to the scrolling of an element (often the page itself) can now be done in CSS rather than needing to bind DOM scrolling events in JavaScript. They come in two varieties:</p>



<ul>
<li>The scroll progress of the element. (<code>animation-timeline: scroll()</code>)</li>



<li>An element’s current viewable position within the element. (<code>animation-timeline: view()</code>)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="toc-32">When should you care?</h3>



<p>Imagine a reading progress indicator bar that fills from 0% to 100% as the user scrolls down the page. That can be done with an animation moving the <code>background-position</code> of an element tried to the overall scroll position of the page. Doing this in CSS instead of JavaScript is <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/scroll-animation-performance-case-study/">good for performance</a>.</p>



<p>The other major use case covered by scroll-driven animations is to run an animation as an element enters (or leaves!) the viewport. You have lots of control over the details, like when the animation starts and ends based on how visible the element is.</p>

<h2 id="toc-35">Anchor Positioning</h2>



<h3 id="toc-36">What is Anchor Positioning?</h3>



<p>Anchor positioning allows you to place items relative to where another element is. Seems pretty obvious when put like that, but that’s what it is. You declare an element an anchor and give it a name, then can position elements to the top/right/bottom/left (or center, or the logical equivalents) of the anchor.</p>



<h3 id="toc-37">When should you care?</h3>



<p>Once you can use this freely, you’ll have to care less about exact DOM positioning of elements (aside from accessibility concerns). The way it is now, the element you want to position relative to another has to be a <em>child</em> element and for there to be a positioning context to work within. This can dictate where elements go in the DOM, whether or not that makes sense. </p>

<h2 id="toc-40">Scoping</h2>



<h3 id="toc-41">What is Scoped CSS?</h3>



<p>Scoping in CSS is in the form of an <code>@scope</code> at-rule that declares a block of CSS to only apply to the given selector. And optionally, <em>stop</em> applying at another given selector. </p>



<h3 id="toc-42">When should you care?</h3>



<p>You can also scope CSS by applying a class and nesting within that class. But <code>@scope</code> has a few tricks up it’s sleeve that can make it interesting. The “donut scope” option is a unique ability it has:</p>


<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-10" data-shcb-language-name="CSS" data-shcb-language-slug="css"><span><code><span>@scope</span> (.card) to (.markdown-output) {
  <span>h2</span> {
    <span>background</span>: tan; <span>/* stop doing this when we get to the Markdown */</span>
  }
}</code></span><small id="shcb-language-10"><span>Code language:</span> <span>CSS</span> <span>(</span><span>css</span><span>)</span></small></pre>


<p>More logical proximity styling is another useful feature. This is a bit tricky to explain but once you see it you can’t unsee it. Consider theming. You have a <code>.dark</code> selector and a <code>.light</code> selector. If you only ever use one on the entire page, that’s fine, but if you end up <em>nesting</em> them at all, because they have the same specificity, whichever one you define later is technically a bit more powerful, and can win out even if it doesn’t make sense to. Minimal example:</p>


<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-11" data-shcb-language-name="CSS" data-shcb-language-slug="css"><span><code><span>.purple-paragraphs</span> <span>p</span> { <span>color</span>: purple; }
<span>.red-paragraphs</span> <span>p</span> { <span>color</span>: red; }</code></span><small id="shcb-language-11"><span>Code language:</span> <span>CSS</span> <span>(</span><span>css</span><span>)</span></small></pre>

<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-12" data-shcb-language-name="HTML, XML" data-shcb-language-slug="xml"><span><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"purple-paragraphs"</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"red-paragraphs"</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"purple-paragraphs"</span>&gt;</span>
       <span>&lt;<span>p</span>&gt;</span>some text<span>&lt;/<span>p</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span></code></span><small id="shcb-language-12"><span>Code language:</span> <span>HTML, XML</span> <span>(</span><span>xml</span><span>)</span></small></pre>


<p>You might think the paragraph element in there would have the color purple, but it <a href="https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/oNOpqJK">will actually be red</a>. That’s just awkward, but it <a href="https://codepen.io/web-dot-dev/pen/MWZqazx">can be fixed with <code>@scope</code></a>. When scoped selectors match, <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/at-scope">as Bramus says</a>, “it weighs both selectors by proximity to their scoping root”, and since “light” is closer here, it would win.</p>



<p>My favorite though is the ability to drop in a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag in the DOM and have it apply scoped styles only to that bit of the DOM, without having to name anything.</p>


<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-13" data-shcb-language-name="HTML, XML" data-shcb-language-slug="xml"><span><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"my-cool-component"</span>&gt;</span>

    <span>@scope</span> {
      <span>:scope</span> { <span>/* selects the div above, without having to select it by class or anything */</span>
      }
      <span>.card</span> {
      }
    }
  </span><span>&lt;/<span>style</span>&gt;</span>

  <span>&lt;<span>article</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"card"</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/<span>article</span>&gt;</span>

<h2 id="toc-45">Cascade Layers</h2>



<h3 id="toc-46">What are Layers?</h3>



<p>Cascade Layers in CSS are an extremely powerful syntax that affects the styling strength of a chunk of styles. You can optionally name and order layers (if you don’t explicitly order them, they order in source order). Styles in higher layers automatically beat styles in lower layers, <strong>regardless of selector strength.</strong> Styles <em>not</em> within layers are the most powerful. </p>


<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-14" data-shcb-language-name="HTML, XML" data-shcb-language-slug="xml"><span><code><span>&lt;<span>body</span> <span>id</span>=<span>"home"</span>&gt;</span></code></span><small id="shcb-language-14"><span>Code language:</span> <span>HTML, XML</span> <span>(</span><span>xml</span><span>)</span></small></pre>

<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-15" data-shcb-language-name="CSS" data-shcb-language-slug="css"><span><code><mark><span><span>@layer</span> base {
</span></mark><span><span>  <span>body</span><span>#home</span> {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>margin</span>: <span>0</span>;
</span></span><span><span>    <span>background</span>: <span>#eee</span>;
</span></span><span><span>  }
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>body</span> {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>background</span>: white;
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></span><small id="shcb-language-15"><span>Code language:</span> <span>CSS</span> <span>(</span><span>css</span><span>)</span></small></pre>


<p>We’re used to thinking that <code>body#home</code> is a <em>much</em> more powerful selector, thus the background will be <code>#eee</code>. But because there are unlayered styles here, that will win, making the background <code>white</code>. </p>



<p>You may have as many layers as you like and can order them upfront. I think layering is likely to become a best practice on new greenfield projects, and take shape something like:</p>


<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-16" data-shcb-language-name="CSS" data-shcb-language-slug="css"><span><code><span>@layer</span> reset, default, themes, patterns, layouts, components, utilities;</code></span><small id="shcb-language-16"><span>Code language:</span> <span>CSS</span> <span>(</span><span>css</span><span>)</span></small></pre>


<p>One gotcha is that <code>!important</code> rules on <em>lower</em> layers are actually <em>more </em>powerful.</p>



<h3 id="toc-47">When should you care?</h3>



<p>One clear way you get a lot of value out of CSS layers if you work on a project that uses a third-party styling library. You can put that library on a lower layer than the styles that your team writes, and you won’t have to worry about <strong>fighting</strong> the third-party library in terms of selector strength. Your styles on a higher layer will always win, which is likely to create cleaner and more maintainable CSS.</p>



<p>For example, put all of Bootstrap on a lower layer just using the <code>layer</code> keyword and then any styles you write after that will win, even if Bootstrap itself uses a higher power selector.</p>


<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-17" data-shcb-language-name="CSS" data-shcb-language-slug="css"><span><code><span>@import</span> url(<span>"https://cdn.com/bootstrap.css"</span>) layer;

<span>h5</span> {
  <span>margin-bottom</span>: <span>2rem</span>;

<h2 id="toc-50">Logical Properties</h2>



<h3 id="toc-51">What are Logical Properties?</h3>



<p>Logical properties are alternatives to properties that specify a direction. For example, in a left-to-right language like English, the <code>inline</code> direction is horizontal and the <code>block</code> direction is vertical, so <code>margin-right</code> is equivalent to <code>margin-inline-end</code> and <code>margin-top</code> is equivelant to <code>margin-block-start</code>. In a right-to-left language like Arabic, <code>margin-inline-end</code> changes to the equivalent of <code>margin-left</code>, because that is the end side of the inline flow of elements. There are <em>a lot</em> of CSS properties and values that have a directional component like this (border, padding, offset, set), so the trick is understanding <code>inline</code> and <code>block</code> flow and using the correct <code>start</code> or <code>end</code> value.</p>



<h3 id="toc-52">When should you care?</h3>



<p>Often when you are declaring directional information in CSS, what you <em>mean</em> is “in the inline direction of text”. That might sound strange, but imagine a button and the space between an icon and the text. If you apply <code>margin-right</code> to the icon to space it away from the text, but then the page is translated to a right-to-left language, that spacing is now <em>on the wrong side</em> of the icon. What you meant was <code>margin-inline-end</code> on the icon. If you code your side using logical properties in this way,<strong> it will automatically translate better without writing any additional conditional code. </strong></p>

<h2 id="toc-55">P3 Colors</h2>



<h3 id="toc-56">What is the Display P3 Color Space?</h3>



<p>We’re largely used to the sRGB color space on the web. That’s what hex colors use, and the <code>rgb()</code>, <code>hsl()</code>, and <code>hsb()</code> functions.  Many displays these days are capable of display a much <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/10042/wide-gamut-color-in-css-with-display-p3/">wider range of colors</a> than sRGB is capable of describing, so being limited to that color space sucks. The Display P3 color space is about 50% wider than sRGB, expanding in the direction of more rich and vibrant colors. New CSS functions, which can even use different color <em>models</em> that have their own useful properties, allow us to declare colors in this space.</p>



<h3 id="toc-57">When should you care?</h3>



<p>If you want to use colors that are quite vibrant, you’ll need to tap into colors in the P3 Color Space. Using newer color models (and functions) can do this, and are very useful for a variety of other things.</p>



<p>For example, the <code>oklch()</code> function (and thus <a href="https://oklch.com/#61.88,0.286,342.4,100">OKLCH color model</a>) can display any color any other method can (plus P3), has a similar human readability in common with <code>hsl()</code>, and has “uniform perceived brightness”, so that the first number (lightness) behaves way more predictably than it does in <code>hsl()</code>. That’s awfully nice for color on the web. But it’s not the only new color model and function! I find the <code>oklab</code> color model generally best for gradients.</p>

<h2 id="toc-60">Color Mixing</h2>



<h3 id="toc-61">What is <code>color-mix()</code>?</h3>



<p>The <code>color-mix()</code> function in CSS allows you to, <em>wait for it</em>, mix colors. This kind of thing has been baked into CSS processing tools for a long time, and as typical of CSS evolution, now that it’s in native CSS, it’s more thoughtful and powerful than it ever was in a processor. </p>



<h3 id="toc-62">When you should care?</h3>



<p>Have you ever wanted to darken or lighten a color you already have on the fly? That’s one of the things <code>color-mix()</code> can do. Color mixing can happen <em>in a specific color model</em> which means you can take advantage of how that models works. For example, the perceptually uniform brightness of OKLCH makes it sensible to use for adjusting brightness. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/color-palettes-css-color-mix/">You can make whole color palettes</a> using <code>color-mix()</code>. </p>

<h2 id="toc-65">Margin Trim</h2>



<h3 id="toc-66">What is <code>margin-trim</code>?</h3>



<p>The <code>margin-trim</code> property removes any margin in the direction specified from the selected container <em>at the end of that direction.</em> Imagine you have five blocks in a row that all have right margin on them in a container. You might select the <code>:last-child</code> to remove the right margin. With <code>margin-trim</code> you can ensure that margin is removed from the parent element itself.</p>


<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-18" data-shcb-language-name="CSS" data-shcb-language-slug="css"><span><code><span>.container</span> {
  <span>/* prevent "extra" margin at the end of the element */</span>
  <span>margin-trim</span>: block-end;

  <span>/* an element like this might be the culprit, but it could be anything */</span>

  }

<h3 id="toc-67">When should you care?</h3>



<p>You know how the <code>gap</code> property of flexbox and grid is… awesome? It only puts spacing <em>between</em> elements. Well, if you need to apply spacing between elements but you’re in a position where you can’t use <code>gap</code>, <code>margin-trim</code> is awfully nice as it means you apply directional margin to all the children and not worry about an additional fancy selector to select the first or last one and remove that unneeded final margin. It might end up <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/2023/06/12/margin-trim-as-a-best-practice/">a best practice</a>.</p>

<h2 id="toc-70">Text Wrapping</h2>



<h3 id="toc-71">What is <code>text-wrap</code>?</h3>



<p>The <code>text-wrap</code> property likely isn’t in your long term CSS memory. It’s capable of <code>text-wrap: nowrap;</code>, but we generally think of <code>white-space: nowrap;</code> for this. But now, <code>text-wrap</code> has two new tricks up it’s sleeve:</p>



<ul>
<li><code>text-wrap: balance;</code> — Attempt to make equal-width lines when text wraps.</li>



<li><code>text-wrap: pretty;</code>  — Avoid orphans.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="toc-72">When should you care?</h3>



<p>A headline with one word orphaned onto the next line just looks really awkward and could be considered poor typography. There wasn’t a great way to solve this before, short of somewhat awkward tricks like inserting a <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> instead of a normal space between the last two words. <em>Balancing </em>a headline prevents this, but goes further in making the multiple lines of text generally the same width. Using <code>pretty</code> is more focused just on orphan prevention alone, making it more appropriate for body text.</p>

<h2 id="toc-75">Subgrid</h2>



<h3 id="toc-76">What is Subgrid?</h3>



<p>Subgrid is an optional part of using CSS grid that is relevant when you are nesting gridded elements. By setting <code>grid-template-columns: subgrid;</code> or <code>grid-template-rows: subgrid;</code> on a grid-level element, you’re saying “inherit these columns or rows from my parent grid, where relevant”. </p>



<h3 id="toc-77">When should you care?</h3>



<p>The point of using grids for layout is generally <em>lining things up</em>. Without <code>subgrid</code>, it means that child elements of a grid don’t have access to the grid lines of the parent grid, and thus lack the opportunity help line things up. Subgrid fills that gap. When DOM nesting is important for functionality or accessibility, like in a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>, subgrid can help <a href="https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/YzxqJap">ensure things line up sensibly</a>.</p>

You have to make sure the logo looks right in context and doesn’t break any of the styles of the elements around it. It’s one of those all-too-simple tasks that I also usually procrastinate doing until I really need to.</p><p>So, I figured it was perfect for an AI. I decided to try Copilot Workspace—from here, simply referred to as CW—to see how it would do.</p><h4><strong>Create a task</strong></h4><p>First, I opened up CW and created a task.

I experimented with different prompts (and looked through the GitHub documentation) and learned that giving it more detail should lead to better results.</p><p>Once I inputted the task, CW processed it and created a specification: a map of the current state of the codebase, and a set of criteria for what success looks like.</p><h4><strong>Specifying out your idea of success</strong></h4><p>CW creates a specification through a process that is sort of like what I do before I leave the house to grab coffee: I tap both of my pants pockets to make sure I have my phone, AirPods, wallet, and keys. In a sense, I am asking my pants, “Do you contain all of the essentials I need in order to leave the house, purchase a coffee, and make sure I don’t get locked out?”&nbsp;</p><p>Depending on how they reply—bear with me—I know whether each item is either present or missing. This helps me to create a plan to gather the things I need to find in order to successfully complete my mission. (Note to self: Your wallet is always wedged in some physics-defying configuration between the couch and the wall. Look there. Not there? Look again.)</p><p>In a sense, CW does this, too. Given the task you assigned it, it attempts to figure out the current state of your codebase (to put it in pants terms, it taps the codebase and finds the wallet and keys are missing). Then it proposes a set of tests for what your codebase <em>should</em> look like when the task has been completed properly (the wallet and keys are now safely slotted in their proper pockets).&nbsp;</p><p>To make it even easier, it does this in normal English:</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/3089/optimized_as8Rl7g48-MU0tVnmJ374yGQ_k9dNcjzmFNiSo5dXqeued67Ba7ecXEaDjyhLKL72rjMnjiHWYyPSL-pEbqfalepEMNDeSb2csQNcD--Biav64oq7Yka_Nae-6ICqZ9HfJJeT3PDUKPxy3lQMPxc4bA.png?link=true" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/3089/optimized_as8Rl7g48-MU0tVnmJ374yGQ_k9dNcjzmFNiSo5dXqeued67Ba7ecXEaDjyhLKL72rjMnjiHWYyPSL-pEbqfalepEMNDeSb2csQNcD--Biav64oq7Yka_Nae-6ICqZ9HfJJeT3PDUKPxy3lQMPxc4bA.png"></a></p><p>Plus, you can edit each step of this process and, if you want to, add your own ideas in natural language. Basically, you can give CW your own test criteria for what success should look like so that it will check against it as it writes code.</p><p>Once you’re satisfied with the specification, you move on to the plan.</p><h4><strong>Creating your plan</strong></h4><p>If the specification stage is about figuring out <em>what</em> needs to be done in your codebase, the planning step is <em>how</em> it will be done. At this stage, CW gets into the nitty-gritty details of your codebase and writes out the changes it will make to each file:</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/3089/optimized_MOvGCMjcDZdGAkNuRPc6d7LubWSoTLI5l32AyWlwF8MoO_O8787S_XeVKyow060g3YWGt5stYuLE8j0hGO8lttbwMQ_WvK972VywLh4s02h8BoUVOd11I5BbWBv-MiGPRNJq197vooLfrHuTyLdfz9U.png?link=true" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/3089/optimized_MOvGCMjcDZdGAkNuRPc6d7LubWSoTLI5l32AyWlwF8MoO_O8787S_XeVKyow060g3YWGt5stYuLE8j0hGO8lttbwMQ_WvK972VywLh4s02h8BoUVOd11I5BbWBv-MiGPRNJq197vooLfrHuTyLdfz9U.png"></a></p><p>Again, this all happens in natural language, and you can edit or add anything to the plan if you think CW is missing something. Once you’re satisfied, you hit <em>implement</em>—and the magic begins.﻿﻿</p><h4><strong>It codes!</strong></h4><p>I’ve been programming with AI for more than a year-and-a-half, and this part is <em>still</em> so fun to me. When you hit <em>implement</em>, CW will take your plan and write the corresponding code for you inside your codebase.</p><p>You can watch it work in real time, and, at the end, you can see a diff of each file—a way to see highlights of anything that changed:</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/3089/optimized_zseDcYcJzSNciNS1R7-HY_09mM-0DvVEBM3p1Gyc57Dn6JNU_KKiA4OxnHhWzHV_92AoIYoSRVGaoNfL3chkvEJ-xWuMeKlsW2g7vg4fwMH97wVkENm8IOkHXRSk8ICDo3Ie0_dB5pXIKKhutQL6F-M.png?link=true" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/3089/optimized_zseDcYcJzSNciNS1R7-HY_09mM-0DvVEBM3p1Gyc57Dn6JNU_KKiA4OxnHhWzHV_92AoIYoSRVGaoNfL3chkvEJ-xWuMeKlsW2g7vg4fwMH97wVkENm8IOkHXRSk8ICDo3Ie0_dB5pXIKKhutQL6F-M.png"></a></p><p>Normally, when I’m doing this with ChatGPT, I’m constantly hopping back and forth between my browser and my programming environment, copy-pasting code into ChatGPT and vice versa. CW’s experience, by contrast, is fully integrated into your codebase so you can take your fingers off the keyboard and watch.<em> Look, Ma, no hands!</em></p><p>If you’re satisfied with the changes CW makes, you can create a <em>pull request</em> and instantly have the new feature merged into your codebase. It’s very cool.&nbsp;</p><p>And, indeed, it did create the proper code in the proper file: It swapped out the old logo for the new one—no programming or copy-pasting required.</p><p>The question is: How does this kind of programming agent experience compare to using ChatGPT or Claude to accomplish the same thing?</p><h2>Is GitHub Copilot Workspace the future of programming?</h2><p>ChatGPT is a fresh, blank notebook: There’s no structure, and you can use it for pretty much anything. But that means there are very few guardrails, so it can be difficult to get the most out of it.</p><p>Copilot Workspace is more like a bullet journal: It follows a process to help you get tasks done. It’s purpose-built for programming, so it’s less flexible than ChatGPT, but in some situations it might be more effective.</p><p>While working with CW, I noticed a few things. First, it was slow. I attempted the same update (with the same initial prompt) to our internal Spiral app with CW, ChatGPT, and Claude so that I could compare them side-by-side. Both ChatGPT and Claude returned answers within 10-20 seconds. CW took two to three minutes to return.&nbsp;</p><p>I think this is because both ChatGPT and Claude just output the small snippets of code that I needed to change. CW, by contrast, rewrote the entire file, which took more time.</p><p>On the plus side, I found the code generation from CW to be higher quality. ChatGPT and Claude both got the answer right, but they made some subtle, pesky mistakes that I would’ve had to clean up by hand. CW took longer, yes, but it got it right on the first go.&nbsp;</p><p>I spent some time trying to hack CW (don’t get mad at me, GitHub, it was very nice hacking!) with various prompt injections to get it to tell me which AI models it was using under the hood, but alas, it declined to reveal its secrets:</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/3089/optimized_LcrmNRuN4i7AzKoMCwa6clQo3zG7TbO2dSpgjlWysle2akikpd2lqnwQXnCrsB6_5qgm17pQ1bRAeHOYsLSjyoRNPysU-6HklfhiE4H_D0WZFlkGN5ETcD1nrJGVxBuE55iM-tMD9EyDaslfAZKdk3w.png?link=true" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/3089/optimized_LcrmNRuN4i7AzKoMCwa6clQo3zG7TbO2dSpgjlWysle2akikpd2lqnwQXnCrsB6_5qgm17pQ1bRAeHOYsLSjyoRNPysU-6HklfhiE4H_D0WZFlkGN5ETcD1nrJGVxBuE55iM-tMD9EyDaslfAZKdk3w.png"></a></p><p>Based on my experience with the logo replacement, it’s a fair assumption that CW would be quite good at fixing small issues or minor feature requests that constantly pop up in mature codebases. It may not get everything right the first time, but it’d probably be enough to get an engineer 90 percent of the way for minor tasks. And it’s deeply integrated into GitHub, which makes it easy to manage and merge the changes.</p><p>But what about the holy grail: Can you let it run wild on a big feature request? I tried it out on that as well. I’ve been meaning to create a team-sharing flow for Spiral so it’s easier for Every team members to share spirals with one another. This one yielded more mixed results, but the reason <em>why</em> might surprise you.</p><p>To get started, I wrote a short paragraph for how I thought the sharing feature <em>should</em> work, and CW built a spec for it:</p><p><a href="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/3089/optimized_fxJt5Dj_Qd1oZGLrqzUapugavUzwta8evbwCKHcRkITwmNT-G61vrnnWsbWXYg8rNb9R4tacjw8xnysjIHRxCeWFgaFbeW9kq5vwXNE8dIs410XKVsXWeQW4OCS5dWS8w2Iuf7ZLfTIUZA8h6bsYbwk.png?link=true" target="_blank"><img src="https://d24ovhgu8s7341.cloudfront.net/uploads/editor/posts/3089/optimized_fxJt5Dj_Qd1oZGLrqzUapugavUzwta8evbwCKHcRkITwmNT-G61vrnnWsbWXYg8rNb9R4tacjw8xnysjIHRxCeWFgaFbeW9kq5vwXNE8dIs410XKVsXWeQW4OCS5dWS8w2Iuf7ZLfTIUZA8h6bsYbwk.png"></a></p><p>But my eyes glazed over looking at the spec. Everything looked basically right, but it was difficult to know whether or not I should let CW proceed to a plan and implementation, or whether I needed to back up a step.</p><p>Why? I realized I didn’t have a good understanding of what the feature should be. There are a bunch of different ways to do sharing, and a lot of subtle decisions to be made. CW had taken my nebulous task and made those decisions for me. That could be great in some situations, but it was hard for me to discern which decisions it had made and what their effects would be on the final experience.&nbsp;</p><p>Basically, I had a <em>vague</em> mental model of what I wanted to be built. CW took that and created a <em>specific</em> model of what it thought I meant. But it felt taxing to try to map CW’s design onto the model in my head. The task was too big; I felt like I needed to visualize it somehow.</p><p>So despite not totally understanding it, I went ahead and asked it to perform a full implementation, just to see what would happen. And when it started coding, I noticed some issues in the code it was writing. It was writing the code based on the plan it made, but I only saw the issues in the plan once I saw the final code.</p><p>I don’t usually have this experience with ChatGPT. I think that’s for two reasons.</p><p>First, I often ask ChatGPT to ask me questions about a feature I’m building so I can flesh out anything that’s underspecified before it starts to plan how to build the feature. This helps make my thinking sharper and its plan more likely to be correct. We’re building a shared model of the feature together step-by-step—so we’re both clear on what it should look like at the end.</p><p>Second, I’m often working with fast feedback loops between ChatGPT, my code editor, and a local version of whatever app I’m building. I’m picking off a small chunk of a feature, building it, and then seeing the results. So I can quickly see the downstream effects of any code ChatGPT is creating and iterating toward the result I want. I’m not asking ChatGPT to build an entire feature at once like I did with CW.</p><p>There are some easy solutions —some on CW’s side and some on mine. On the CW side, it would be awesome if, after I inputted a task, CW initiated a chat session to help expand upon what I actually want before it moves on to a specification. Sometimes I don’t know yet! I only have a vague idea, and I wish it would force me to get more clear so that we build up our understanding of what needs to be done together.</p><p>On my end, using a tool like this effectively will involve learning to understand what kinds of tasks it can handle, how hefty an assignment it can handle by itself, and then using it explicitly for that. I need to learn how to be a good <a href="https://every.to/chain-of-thought/the-knowledge-economy-is-over-welcome-to-the-allocation-economy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">model manager</a> for this kind of model.</p><p>It’s definitely not yet at a point where I can hand it a vague notion of a complex feature and have it be built end-to-end like I might expect a human programmer to do. But it could dramatically speed up many of the tasks involved in creating that feature, if it’s used properly.</p><p>Copilot Workspace is still in technical preview, so I expect some of its shortcomings are growing pains that will be resolved before it’s released more widely.</p><p>Putting those quibbles aside, though, CW is a step in the direction of the future. English is becoming a programming language. You’ll still have to understand and use scripting languages like Python or Javascript, or lower-level languages like C.&nbsp;</p><p>But most software will probably start as sentences written into an interface like CW’s.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s an exciting time to be a programmer.</p><hr><p><strong><em>Dan Shipper</em></strong><em> is the cofounder and CEO of Every, where he writes the </em><a href="https://every.to/chain-of-thought" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Chain of Thought</em></a><em> column and hosts the podcast</em> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5qX1nRTaFsfWdmdj5JWO1G" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">How Do You Use ChatGPT?</a> <em>You can follow him on X at </em><a href="https://twitter.com/danshipper" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>@danshipper</em></a><em> and on </em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danshipper/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>LinkedIn</em></a><em>, and Every on X at </em><a href="https://twitter.com/every" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>@every</em></a><em> and on </em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/everyinc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>LinkedIn</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p dir="auto">Most design systems have a spacing system that is based on multiples of a base unit. For example, a spacing system might have a base unit of 4px, and then multiples of that unit, such as 8px, 12px, 16px, etc. This is a great way to ensure that spacing is consistent across the design system.</p>
<p dir="auto">However the added line-height destroys the spacing system:</p>

<p dir="auto">Aligning icons with text is a common problem. With leading trim, you can align the icon with the text:</p>

<p dir="auto">In articles images are often placed next to images. The leading trim property allows you to remove the whitespace above the text to align the text with the image.</p>

<p><span><span>S</span>tanding amid rows of juicy, lime green lettuce and chunky florets of broccoli, Jose Paiz appears as if he could be the owner of a modern, high-tech farm. But the crops thriving here, in the suburbs of Mexico City, are part of a 1,000-year-old tradition.</span></p>
<p><span>“My ancestors were doing this before even the [Spanish] Conquistadors arrived in Mexico [in 1519],” says Paiz, while crouching down to pick up a handful of powdery soil from the </span><i><span>chinampa</span></i><span>, or “floating garden,” on which we are both standing.</span></p>
<p><span>These highly productive man-made island-farms, which can be found floating on lakes across the south of Mexico’s capital, date back to </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Mexico/The-rise-of-the-Aztecs"><span>the time of the Aztecs</span></a><span> or perhaps even earlier — and now proponents say that these ancient engineering wonders could provide an important, sustainable food source as the city faces historic drought.</span></p>

<p><span>“My grandparents taught me the methods,” adds Paiz, 32, who is the fifth generation of his family to be a </span><i><span>chinampero</span></i><span> working in San Gregorio Atlapulco, a traditional working-class neighborhood about 10 miles south of the center of Mexico City.</span></p>
<p><span>Experts say that these chinampas, which have been recognized as a </span><a target="_blank" href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/412/"><span>UNESCO World Heritage</span></a><span> site, are considered one of the most productive agricultural systems in the world. The artificial islands are built by gathering large amounts of soil from the bottom of the lake and placing it on top of reeds, grasses and rushes in a mass that rises above the water. Farmers then plant a fence of </span><i><span>ahuejotes</span></i><span>, Mexican willow trees, around the plot to naturally protect against erosion. This system means that the chinampa’s soil is constantly enriched by nutrient-filled sediment flowing in from the surrounding ditches and canals, yielding multiple harvests every year.</span></p>

<p><span>“In terms of agriculture, they are one of the best examples of how humans can work with nature,” says Lucio Usobiaga, founder of </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.arcatierra.com/"><span>Arca Tierra</span></a><span>, an organization providing local farmers in the area with technical and entrepreneurial support.</span></p>
<p><span>One of the first traces of the chinampas dates back to the 14th century, when the Aztecs arrived at the region of what is now modern-day Mexico City. There, they founded the settlement of </span><a target="_blank" href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/tenochtitlan/"><span>Tenochtitlán</span></a><span> — which would become one of the most powerful cities in all Mesoamerica — in the Valley of Mexico.&nbsp;</span></p>

</div>
<p><span>But as the Aztecs soon discovered, the valley’s boggy, lake-filled landscape was difficult to cultivate or build on. So they devised an ingenious plan to adapt to the surroundings: the chinampas.</span></p>
<p><span>A 2013 </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.acsa-arch.org/chapter/encountering-ecological-urban-solutions-for-the-future-mexican-urban-fabric/"><span>paper</span></a><span> by North Carolina State University professor Matthew Teti found that in the 16th century, chinampa farms could produce 13 times as much crop as dry-land farming in the same area — a system that provided food for hundreds of thousands of people. Chinampas, the study said, are “one of the most intensive and productive agricultural systems ever devised.”</span></p>

<p>Greens and other vegetables flourish on the chinampas, which are considered one of the most productive agricultural systems in the world.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>“Aztec planners created these vital waterways as integral to the existence of its cultural, physical, and spiritual, urban identity, rather than draining the water and excluding it from the urban experience,” it continued.</span></p>
<p><span>In the case of Jose Paiz, the age-old system is still reaping rewards today. He says that his 7,000 square meters of chinampa, for example, can produce as much as 100 kilograms of broccoli per day — which is sold alongside the yields of fresh herbs, spinach, chard, radishes, corn and kale at local markets in the south of Mexico City.</span></p>
<p><span>“I’m proud to be continuing the tradition of my ancestors,” he says.</span></p>

<p><span>Meanwhile, according to Arca Tierra, their network of seven producers in the region cultivates over 40,000 square meters of land, employing a total of 27 workers in the field and producing 3,650 kilograms per month. At some farms, as many as 95 varieties of vegetables and herbs are cultivated, underlining the fertility of the method. The production brings in over $4,000 per month in crop sales.</span></p>
<p><span>“At the beginning, it was mainly a commercial endeavor to source organic produce close to the city,” says Usobiaga, who supplies restaurants in Mexico City and began working with chinamperos in 2009. “But I learned they are very important in many regards and have historical and cultural importance.”</span></p>
<p><span>The design of the chinampas is particularly efficient in its use of water, which it can absorb and retain from the surrounding canals for long periods as well as allowing crops to draw from the groundwater directly, reducing the need for active irrigation.</span></p>

<p>When it comes to farming, according to Lucio Usobiaga, founder of Arca Tierra, the chinampas “are one of the best examples of how humans can work with nature.”</p>

<p><span>This could prove hugely valuable for Mexico City and its 22 million residents, since water supplies have </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/08/1234928040/mexico-city-water-problems#:~:text=The%20reservoirs%20that%20supply%20the,low%20rainfall%20in%20recent%20years."><span>fallen to historic lows</span></a><span> due to abnormally low rainfall partly attributable to climate change. And lessons learned from the chinampas could potentially help cities around the planet: the </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/upcoming-report-focuses-partnerships-realize-human-rights-water-and-sanitation#:~:text=The%202023%20United%20Nations%20World%20Water%20Development%20Report%20(UN%20WWDR,rights%20to%20water%20and%20sanitation."><span>UN World Water Development 2024 Report</span></a><span> found the number of people lacking access to drinking water in cities will likely reach two billion by 2050.</span></p>
<p><span>“The technical aspects of agriculture are innate to every place,” says Usobiaga. “But the way of thinking that created the chinampas, that sensibility, has to be appreciated and valued: To work with the flow of nature, the flow of the seasons. That is what we have to use to get us out of the problem we are in.”</span></p>

<p><span>The unique wetlands ecosystem is also home to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fao.org/3/I9159EN/i9159en.pdf">two percent of the world’s and 11 percent of Mexico’s biodiversity</a>, including the critically endangered <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/amphibians/facts/axolotl">axolotl</a>, or <i>Ambystoma mexicanum</i>, an incredible salamander-like amphibian that is able to regenerate every part of its body — even parts of its vital organs such the heart and brain.</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, the chinampas also provide a host of other benefits: they filter water, cool the city, sequester carbon, offer green space for locals, and are now a popular destination for tourists who take boats along the picturesque waterways.</span></p>
<p><span>The value of the chinampas was underlined during the Covid-19 pandemic, when, as the city’s major markets ground to a halt, the chinampas were able to provide healthy, locally-grown food. In some cases, sales </span><a target="_blank" href="https://grist.org/food/in-mexico-city-the-coronavirus-is-bringing-back-aztec-era-floating-gardens/"><span>more than doubled</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>“People began to search for healthier food,” says David Monachon, a social sciences researcher at the National Autonomous University of Mexico who has </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/371513995_Building_Bridges_Between_Actors_and_Territories_in_Mexico_City_Challenges_Opportunities_and_Paradoxes_of_Sustainable_Food_Initiatives"><span>researched</span></a><span> the chinampas as a sustainable food source. “There was this focus on local economy and community. Many people didn’t make this connection before.”</span></p>
<p><span>Yet despite their immense value, the chinampas are under threat: rising urbanization means the chinampa landscape is being built on; pollution is dirtying the waters that feed them; younger generations are losing interest in agriculture; and agro-industry is under-cutting the small-scale producers in a price war.</span></p>

<p>For chinamperos like Jose Paiz, the age-old agricultural system is still reaping rewards today.</p>

<p><span>“There are a lot of challenges and problems,” says Monachon, who is supporting a local cooperative of </span><span>chinamperos</span><span> to sell their goods via the </span><a target="_blank" href="https://cous.sdi.unam.mx/blog/mercado-universitario-alternativo-mua"><span>Mercado Universitario Alternativo</span></a><span>, or Alternative University Market. “But chinampas could feed the city.”</span></p>
<p><span>Now, only </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gob.mx/semarnat/prensa/busca-semarnat-recuperar-las-chinampas-como-sistemas-de-produccion-de-alimentos-sanos"><span>20 percent</span></a><span> of the 2,200 hectares of chinampas are in use, and only about </span><a target="_blank" href="https://ciencia.nasa.gov/ciencias-terrestres/chinampas-milenarias-en-ciudad-de-mexico/"><span>2.5 percent</span></a><span> are being actively cultivated for farming food — the rest is being used for growing flowers and tourism. But Arca Tierra is helping to restore the chinampas — five hectares to date — and is training 15 young students in the required skills to cultivate them — the second, six-month cohort — while also carrying out research on the most effective techniques and productive crops to use on them.</span></p>

<p><span>“We have demonstrated that it can be done on a small scale,” says Usobiaga, who believes chinampas have the potential to produce enough of crops like lettuces, herbs and broccoli for all of Mexico City. “But the chinampas need support and investment from the government to scale up production.”</span></p>
<p><span>At Xochimilco market, the largest in the area, there is clear evidence of appetite for a resilient, local food system and signs that this ancient Aztec tradition can still bear fruit. The market bustles with traders and customers, spilling from the covered area out onto the streets.</span></p>

<p><span>Rosa Garcia, 47, is rushing around delivering lettuce, spinach, cilantro and broccoli to her 14 clients of the day. The produce, grown at her one-hectare chinampa at San Gregorio Atlapulco, is in high demand. Garcia says that each day her family-run farm can earn as much as 1,000 to 1,500 Mexican pesos ($60 to $90).</span></p>
<p><span>“I’ve been doing this since I was a girl,” says Garcia, ticking off the orders as they are dispatched. “It’s a system that works. Why do anything different?”</span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/blog/dns-traffic-can-leak-outside-the-vpn-tunnel-on-android">https://mullvad.net/en/blog/dns-traffic-can-leak-outside-the-vpn-tunnel-on-android</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40247604">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><article itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/BlogPosting"><div> <p> <time datetime="2024-05-03T12:43:30.052367Z" itemprop="datePublished" content="2024-05-03T12:43:30.052367Z">May 3, 2024</time> <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/blog/tag/privacy">Privacy</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://mullvad.net/en/blog/tag/app">App</a>&nbsp;</p>  <p>We were recently made aware of multiple potential DNS leaks on Android. They stem from bugs in Android itself, and only affect certain apps.</p>
<p>On Monday 22 of April we became aware of a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mullvadvpn/comments/1c9p96y/dns_leak_with_block_connections_without_vpn_on/">user report on Reddit</a> of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_leak">DNS leak</a>. The report detailed how the user managed to leak DNS queries when disabling and enabling VPN while having “Block connections without VPN” on. We immediately started an internal investigation that could confirm the issue. The investigation also led to more findings of scenarios that can cause DNS leaks on Android.</p>
<h3>Findings</h3>
<p>Identified scenarios where the Android OS can leak DNS traffic:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a VPN is active without any DNS server configured.</li>
<li>For a short period of time while a VPN app is re-configuring the tunnel or is being force stopped/crashes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The leaks seem to be limited to direct calls to the C function <code>getaddrinfo</code>. Apps that use this way to resolve domain names cause leaks in the scenarios listed above. We have not found any leaks from apps that only use Android API:s such as <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/DnsResolver" rel="nofollow">DnsResolver</a>. The Chrome browser is an example of an app that can use <code>getaddrinfo</code> <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:android_webview/browser/aw_pac_processor.cc;l=197;drc=133b2d903fa57cfda1317bc589b349cf4c284b7c" rel="nofollow">directly</a>.</p>
<p>The above applies regardless of whether <em>Always-on VPN</em> and <em>Block connections without VPN</em> is enabled or not, which is not expected OS behavior and should therefore be fixed upstream in the OS.</p>
<p>We’ve been able to confirm that these leaks occur in multiple versions of Android, including the latest version (Android 14).</p>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<p>Our app currently does not set any DNS server in its blocking state. When our app fails to set up a tunnel in a way that is not recoverable, it enters the blocking state. In this state it stops traffic from leaving the device. However, it does not set any DNS server in this state, and as a result the above described DNS leaks can happen. We will work around the OS bug by setting a bogus DNS server for now. You can expect a release with this fix soon.</p>
<p>The leak during tunnel reconnects is harder for us to mitigate in our app. We are still looking for solutions. We can potentially minimize the amount of times a tunnel re-configuration happens, but we currently don’t think this leak can be fully prevented.</p>
<p>It should be made clear that these workarounds should not be needed in any VPN app. Nor is it wrong for an app to use <code>getaddrinfo</code> to resolve domain names. Instead, these issues should be addressed in the OS in order to protect all Android users regardless of which apps they use.</p>
<p>We have reported <a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/337961996" rel="nofollow">the issues and suggested improvements</a> to Google and hope that they will address this quickly.</p>
<h3>Steps to reproduce</h3>
<p>The following steps reproduce the second scenario above, where a VPN user changes the tunnel configuration, e.g. switching to another server or changing DNS server.</p>
<p>Here we use the WireGuard app since it has become a reference Android VPN implementation. It should be noted that the leaks can probably be reproduced with any other Android VPN app also. We use Chrome to trigger the leaks since it is one of the apps we have confirmed uses <code>getaddrinfo</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download <a href="https://mullvad.net/media/uploads/2024/05/03/spam_get_requests.html">spam_get_requests.html</a></li>
<li>Install the WireGuard app &amp; Chrome</li>
<li>Import <a href="https://mullvad.net/media/uploads/2024/05/03/wg1.conf">wg1.conf</a>, <a href="https://mullvad.net/media/uploads/2024/05/03/wg2.conf">wg2.conf</a> into WireGuard</li>
<li>Enable the wg1 tunnel in the WireGuard app and allow the VPN permission</li>
<li>In Android VPN Settings enable “Always-on VPN” &amp; “Block connections without VPN” for WireGuard</li>
<li>Start capturing data on your router by using e.g <code>tcpdump</code><br><code>$ tcpdump -i &lt;INTERFACE&gt; host &lt;IP of android device&gt;</code></li>
<li>Split the screen to show both WireGuard &amp; Chrome side by side</li>
<li>Open <code>spam_get_requests.html</code> with Chrome &amp; press “Start”</li>
<li>Toggle back and fourth between wg1 and wg2 in the WireGuard app until you see the leaks in the next step.</li>
<li>Observe DNS traffic similar to this on the router:
<pre>11:50:27.816359 IP Pixel-Tablet.lan.53353 &gt; OpenWrt.lan.53: 11200+ A? 307lf5rgn6-19282-11-50-27-519z.mullvad.test.lan. (65)<br>11:50:27.816359 IP Pixel-Tablet.lan.48267 &gt; OpenWrt.lan.53: 44347+ A? 307lf5rgn6-19284-11-50-27-579z.mullvad.test.lan. (65)<br>11:50:27.816396 IP Pixel-Tablet.lan.16747 &gt; OpenWrt.lan.53: 44584+ A? 307lf5rgn6-19289-11-50-27-729z.mullvad.test. (61)<br>11:50:27.816458 IP OpenWrt.lan.53 &gt; Pixel-Tablet.lan.53353: 11200 NXDomain 0/0/0 (65)<br>11:50:27.816476 IP Pixel-Tablet.lan.45727 &gt; OpenWrt.lan.53: 40503+ A? 307lf5rgn6-19290-11-50-27-759z.mullvad.test. (61)<br>11:50:27.816542 IP OpenWrt.lan.53 &gt; Pixel-Tablet.lan.48267: 44347 NXDomain 0/0/0 (65)<br>11:50:27.816588 IP Pixel-Tablet.lan.43821 &gt; OpenWrt.lan.53: 36295+ A? 307lf5rgn6-19291-11-50-27-789z.mullvad.test. (61) 
11:50:27.816625 IP OpenWrt.lan.53 &gt; Pixel-Tablet.lan.16747: 44584 NXDomain 0/0/0 (61)</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Since “Block connections without VPN” was active, nothing except encrypted WireGuard traffic should have left the device, but here we see plaintext DNS leaving the device.</p>
<h3>Conclusions and recommendations</h3>
<p>DNS leaks may have serious privacy implications for users, and can be used to derive users' approximate location or find out what websites and services a user uses.</p>
<p>These finding also shows once again that “Block connections without VPN” does not live up to its name (or documentation) and that it has multiple flaws. Apps may still leak DNS traffic during the conditions mentioned above, and as <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/blog/android-leaks-connectivity-check-traffic">previously reported</a> it still leaks connection check traffic.</p>
<p>Depending on your threat model this might mean that you should avoid using Android altogether for anything sensitive, or employ other mitigations to prevent the leaks. We aim to partially mitigate these problems in our app, so make sure to keep the app up-to-date.</p><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Researchers discovered 27 original volumes containing the lost works of Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm in the library of the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań, Polish science news outlet Nauka w Polske reported on May 2.</p>
<p>The Brothers Grimm, who collected, committed to paper, and popularized many German folk tales, are considered some of the most famous folklorists in the world.<br></p><p> A number of their works were considered to be permanently lost following World War 2.</p><p>However, recent research at the Adam Mickiewicz University Library led to an unexpected discovery — specialists managed to find 27 original volumes with rare prints and unique editions. All of them are a valuable resource for researchers.<br></p>   <p>The volumes are contain a large number of footnotes by the authors, making them an even more important find.<br></p><p> Presumably, the books were brought to the university library in Poznań in the post-war period, following the evacuation of many priceless literary works during the war.</p><p>This discovery suggests that other libraries may also contain works from the Brothers Grimm's private collection.</p><p>The news of this important historical discovery has caused considerable interest among literary researchers and folklorists, who can now more fully explore the legacy of the Brothers Grimm and their influence on world literature.</p>

<p>The high cost of EV (electric vehicle) chargers may lead you to believe that they’re complex systems. But with the exception of Tesla’s Supercharger, that isn’t true. They’re actually quite simple — basically just glorified switches. All of the nitty gritty charging details are the responsibility of the car’s onboard circuitry. With that in mind, EV owners may want to follow Pedro Neves’ guide on building an affordable Arduino-based charging station.</p>



<p>Because the car deals with all of the particulars of charging, the only purpose of the “charger” is to provide a connection to the electrical grid. “Charger” isn’t even the right word, as this is more accurately EVSE (electric vehicle supply equipment). For safety reasons, the car and the EVSE communicate with each other. The car can tell the EVSE when it is safe to provide power and the EVSE will then connect a switch between the charging plug and the electrical grid. It really isn’t any more complex than a $15 smart outlet and most of the cost of an EVSE is the heavy-gauge wiring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here, Neves proves that with a DIY EVSE designed around an <a href="https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-uno-rev3">Arduino UNO Rev3</a> board. It has a custom shield with relays for switching power and to power the Arduino itself with mains voltage. A few LEDs act as status indicators. EVSE protocols are standardized, so Neves was able to program the Arduino to communicate with any connected car. Once the Arduino receives permission from the car, it switches the relays to provide mains voltage. A heavy-duty 3D-printed enclosure contains those components, with a breaker switch and weatherproofing.</p>

<p>It is not a coincidence that the companies that got the most “Hopper” H100 allocations from Nvidia in 2023 were also the hyperscalers and cloud builders, who in many cases wear both hats and who are as interested in renting out their GPU capacity for others to build AI models as they are in innovating in the development of large language models.</p>
<p>Nvidia is obviously very keen on milking the generative AI wave for every last dollar before competition starts picking away at its near monopoly with respect to accelerated computing for LLMs. We think both this wave and Nvidia’s ability to steer its ship through it are bigger than anyone had expected in the summer of 2022 when OpenAI’s ChatGPT launched as an API and transformed the nature of computing in the datacenter.</p>
<p>But the money pot at the end of the GenAI rainbow doesn’t end with Nvidia. It just keeps multiplying as the capacity on these GPUs are rented out and tens of thousands of enterprises are trying to get GPU clock cycles to train their own models and, it is hoped, transform their businesses. This includes the massive GPU complexes created by Microsoft Azure (150K), Meta Platforms (150K), Amazon Web Services (50K), Google Cloud (50K), Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (50K), Tencent (50K), Baidu (30K), and Alibaba (25K), which are ranked there by their Nvidia H100 allocations <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-sold-half-million-h100-001055544.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAuF23jw5h0GzJ1NHWV61UjbTIXa6RmFvJGyctR1XAQLXj8lZcOxZD10OEg3kyxtzt7wBumI2O5ovFqIMurPRhOXiPfl8NUSDkTabd7I6sGEf9_bMTz_yy0ELuqveFxviJanJHbFYZ9ceolfrGUZPlNtfoyg4Yjr1a-6FbU4nBNs">according to data from Omdia</a>, but it also incudes pure GPU cloud players like CoreWeave (40K) and Lambda (20K). And then two wild cards, ByteDance (20K) and Tesla (15K), which are their own thing and which are doing their own LLMs.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this analysis, CoreWeave and Lambda (formerly known as Lambda Labs), are the interesting ones because they are making a lot of noise about GPU allocations and how they are raising venture capital. They also have Wall Street hoping for two big initial public offerings either this year or next.</p>
<p>We understand all the buzz, but we doubt Wall Street has done the math all the way through on this. We leave it to you to reckon if the valuations on these pre-IPO companies make any sense. We think the entirety of the world’s stock markets are overvalued based on the fundamentals, and have been increasingly so over the decades. But we don’t let that cloud our analysis, because <em>value</em> is a relative, not an absolute, metric. Anyone with a 401(k) needs this hot air to be real. (<em>Wait, that includes us, too</em>.)</p>
<p>Let’s have some fun. We have been saving this fascinating chart, which was buried in the same October 2023 financial report that included Nvidia’s roadmap and <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2023/10/12/nvidia-picks-up-the-pace-for-datacenter-roadmaps/">which we edited to make it more accurate</a>, for a good occasion. It explains how the economics of this GPU racket works, at least from the point of view of Nvidia’s top brass:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/nvidia-gpu-datacenter-cost-cloud-revenue.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-144093"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/nvidia-gpu-datacenter-cost-cloud-revenue.jpg" alt="" width="1146" height="512" srcset="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/nvidia-gpu-datacenter-cost-cloud-revenue.jpg 1146w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/nvidia-gpu-datacenter-cost-cloud-revenue-768x343.jpg 768w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/nvidia-gpu-datacenter-cost-cloud-revenue-600x268.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1146px) 100vw, 1146px"></a></p>
<p>The left pie chart is easy enough to understand. If you want to be a GPU cloud player, start with $1 billion. With that, you can buy AI servers with an aggregate of 16,000 H100s for what looks like $400 million, and you spend another $100 million for Nvidia’s InfiniBand networking to link them all together. You spend another $500 million to build a datacenter and operate, power, and cool it over those four years. Nvidia did not depreciate the cost of the datacenter or the iron inside of it, but you obviously do that.</p>
<p>We don’t know where Nvidia came up with that GPU compute price, but at somewhere around $400,000 a pop minimum for a configured GPU server that is a clone of the eight-way DGX H100 from Nvidia, that’s 2,000 servers and that is a cost of $800 million – not $400 million. We do not think the hyperscalers and cloud builders are getting a 50 percent discount given the exorbitant demand for H100s.</p>
<p>Now, you move to the right side. Nvidia says that the rental opportunity at $4 per GPU-hour over the course of four years is around $2.5 billion. We have to do a certain amount of witchcraft to get that number to work out, which we will explain.</p>
<p>First, if you just take 16,000 GPUs and multiply by $4 per hour over four years (at 365.25 days per year and 24 hours in a day), then you get a rental revenue stream of $2.24 billion. Not $2.5 billion. The pie chart on the right seems to imply that by using the more expensive InfiniBand networking rather than Ethernet, you can increase the utilization of the GPUs by 15 percent, which is worth $350 million over four years and increase the throughput of the GPU cluster by 25 percent, which is worth $600 million. If you assume that aggregate 43.8 percent performance improvement means you only need 11,130 H100 GPUs instead of 16,000, and you multiply out the cost at $4 per GPU-hour over four years over 11,130 GPUs, then you get $2.51 billion in rental income if you add $950 million in value to the revenue stream from the GPUs. (We are not saying that is what Nvidia did, but maybe?)</p>
<p>Ah, but wait, we know from analyzing p5 GPU instance pricing from Amazon Web Services,<a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2023/07/27/h100-gpu-instance-pricing-on-aws-grin-and-bear-it/"> which we did in detail last July</a>, that the on-demand instance price for an eight-way H100 system instance was $98.32 per hour, or $12.29 per GPU-hour. We estimated the one year reserved instance cost $57.63 per hour, or $7.20 per GPU-hour, and we know that the published price for the three year reserved instance is $43.16, or $5.40 per GPU-hour.</p>
<p>We think the GPU rent doesn’t change because of the performance improvement or the utilization improvement that comes with using InfiniBand. (We know AWS is not using InfiniBand for these p5 instances, but rather its own EFAv2 implementation of 400 Gb/sec Ethernet.) So here is the deal: If you have 16,000 GPUs, and you have a blended average of on-demand (50 percent), one year (30 percent), and three year (20 percent) instances, then that works out to $5.27 billion in GPU rental income over four years with an average cost of $9.40 per hour for the H100 GPUs. The increased efficiency of using InfiniBand means a cloud could get more customers through those GPUs faster, but it doesn’t change the per hour rental costs. It just means customers finish quicker and more customers can use it, but there are only 35,064 hours in a year with 365.25 days.</p>
<p>So here is how we would edit the chart that Nvidia put together, assuming a more accurate price for H100 GPUs and an upgrade to 800 Gb/sec InfiniBand and more accurate pricing on a mix of p5 instance terms on AWS:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/nvidia-gpu-datacenter-cost-cloud-revenue-tnp-edited.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-144094"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/nvidia-gpu-datacenter-cost-cloud-revenue-tnp-edited.jpg" alt="" width="1146" height="512" srcset="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/nvidia-gpu-datacenter-cost-cloud-revenue-tnp-edited.jpg 1146w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/nvidia-gpu-datacenter-cost-cloud-revenue-tnp-edited-768x343.jpg 768w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/nvidia-gpu-datacenter-cost-cloud-revenue-tnp-edited-600x268.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1146px) 100vw, 1146px"></a></p>
<p>Here is what you need to know, Wall Street: You put $800 of investment in for Nvidia GPUs, another $700 million for a datacenter and networking, and you get $5,270 in revenue back out again if you have a reasonable mix of on-demand and reserved instance customers.</p>
<p>We do not think the numbers will be all that different across the AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud infrastructure, and we doubt in the final analysis that they will be much lower on the GPU price (and therefore revenue) from the likes of CoreWeave or Lambda so long as GPUs are scarce.</p>
<p>Some food for thought: It is always cheaper to rent a smaller number of GPUs for a long time than a larger number of GPUs for a short time, and this has to be juxtaposed against the GPU memory capacity and the GPU memory bandwidth needs of any given size of LLM. Customers might need a large number of GPUs for the memory, not the compute, but they are charged for the compute anyway.</p>
<p>It is with all of this in mind that we consider recent investments in CoreWeave and Lambda.</p>
<p>CoreWeave, which was a bitcoin mining company founded in the New York City suburb of Roseland, New Jersey and which has pivoted to AI processing, announced today that it had received $1.1 billion in Series C financing from Coatue with participation from Magnetar (which led the Series B funding round) as well as Altimeter Capital, Fidelity Management, and Lykos Global Management. That Series B round in December 2023 came to $642 million, which followed a Series A round that raked in $420 million in April 2023. In August last year, CoreWeave also got $2.3 billion in debt financing from Magnetar and Blackstone. This funding is what has allowed CoreWeave to go from three datacenters to fourteen datacenters in the past year. That is $2.16 billion in venture funding and $2.3 billion in loans for a total of $4.46 billion. That sounds like a lot until you realize that this represents the cost for datacenters and GPU systems that have around 47,600 GPUs in total. That used to sound like a lot.</p>
<p>But here’s the fun bit. If you run that number of GPUs through our comparison above, you get $15.68 billion in rental income over four years. So, $4.46 billion in, and $15.68 billion back as revenue.</p>
<p>Assuming that CoreWeave is good enough to get the same 65 percent to 70 percent operating income out of its infrastructure as we think AWS can with its GPU instances over the years, and then pay for sales, marketing, and other stuff, this might be a pretty good business to invest in. And what seems clear is that when it comes to GPU allocations, the size and the speed of the organization matters a lot to Nvidia, which wants to get GPU cycles into the hands of people as quickly as possible to spread the Jensen Way far and wide.</p>
<p>CoreWeave figured out it can be a niche player, but that it has to go big to compete with the hyperscalers and largest cloud builders, which have much larger GPU fleets and will continue to do so. You have to judge for yourself if the tripling of CoreWeave’s valuation by the venture capitalists, which has tripled since its last funding round to $19 billion with the current round, makes sense. There is another equation: $4.46 billion in, $19 billion or more IPO out. CoreWeave founders get rich, and everyone has a different way to catch the Nvidia Wave.</p>
<p>Lambda is going to have to play catchup here. Last December, <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2024/02/16/lambda-snags-320-million-to-grow-its-rent-a-gpu-cloud/">Lambda got a $320 million infusion</a>, and has raised a total of $932.2 million in funding across pre-seed, seed, venture rounds, and debt financing between 2017 and 2023. Lambda started out as a cloud serving AI workloads, shifted to become an AI system maker, and is now focusing more on being a GPU cloud.</p>
<p>Once again: Both CoreWeave and Lambda are saying they can provide GPU access for less money than the big clouds, but that only hurts their cause if you think about it. With GPU capacity scarce, they should try to charge as much as AWS until they can’t, or the price of AWS minus all of the value that comes from SageMaker and Bedrock. <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2024/05/01/amd-firing-on-all-compute-engine-cylinders/">You don’t see AMD giving away its MI300 GPUs</a>, after all; it is charging around the same per unit of compute and unit of memory as what Nvidia is charging for H100s and H200s. And there is no reason for clouds to give away their GPU capacity for less than AWS sells it – at least not yet. When there is a glut of GPU capacity, that will be a different story – and when the HPC centers of the world will be able to swoop in and get a lot of science done on the cheap. <em>Perhaps.</em></p>

<p>A few years ago most API designers, developers, and technical writers would have had very little reason to bump into JSONPath, but its starting to get more and more relevant as more tools and standards start relying on it. So what is JSONPath, what is it used for, and how can you get up to speed with using it?</p>

<p>JSONPath is a query language that can be used to extract data from JSON documents, which at first might not sound very exciting, but remember... OpenAPI is just a JSON (or YAML) document, so you can use JSONPath to poke around in OpenAPI and do various things.</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://github.com/OAI/Overlay-Specification" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JSONPath for OpenAPI Overlays</a>, to patch OpenAPI documents with extra documentation content, code samples, or whatever else.</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.stoplight.io/docs/spectral/d3482ff0ccae9-rules#given" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JSONPath in Spectral</a> to write incredibly advanced linting rules which can power your <a href="https://apisyouwonthate.com/blog/automated-style-guides-for-rest-graphql-grpc/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">automated API Style Guides</a>.</p>

<p>You can even use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/using-jsonpath-effectively-in-aws-step-functions/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JSONPath in AWS Step Functions</a>.</p>

<p>JSONPath is popping up all over the the place these days, and if you work with OpenAPI it's definitely a handy tool to have on your belt.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-jsonpath-work">How does JSONPath Work?</h2>

<p>JSONPath is one of several query languages which will let you filter, query, and traverse through a chunk of JSON, not just to pull bits out, but to navigate complex data structures, with syntax for getting into specific array indexes, filtering through an objects properties or array values before continuing on to its children.</p>

<p>Here's a sample JSONPath from the RFC.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>$</span><span>.</span><span>store</span><span>.</span><span>book</span><span>[?@.</span><span>price</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>10</span><span>].</span><span>title</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Anyone familiar with XPath in XML will be thinking "hmm, this looks pretty familiar!" and you're spot on, JSONPath is <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535#inspired-by-xpath" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">inspired by XPath</a>. If you've never heard of XPath no worries, we'll start from scratch here.
</p>
<p>To see how this works we'll need some JSON to run it against, so here is an example of some JSON from the RFC.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"store"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"book"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>

<p><em>Example JSONPath Expressions and Their Intended Results When Applied to the Example JSON Value, from <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535#name-jsonpath-examples" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">RFC 9535: 1.5. JSONPath Examples</a>.</em></p>

<p>By combining these bits of example syntax together you can do amazing and powerful things with JSONPath, so let's look at how to do those amazing things in OpenAPI.</p>

<h3 id="jsonpath-openapi">JSONPath &amp; OpenAPI</h3>

<p>Take an OpenAPI document, like the <a href="https://github.com/bump-sh-examples/train-travel-api" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Train Travel API</a>.</p>
<div><pre><code>git clone github.com/bump-sh-examples/train-travel-api

<span>cd </span>train-travel-api
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then install <a href="https://www.jsware.io/jsonpath-cli/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">jsonpath-cli</a> just so we can try some things out.</p>
<div><pre><code>npm <span>install</span> <span>-g</span> @jsware/jsonpath-cli
</code></pre></div>
<p>Optional, if you're working with YAML, you might want to convert from YAML to JSON in the CLI too.</p>
<div><pre><code>brew <span>install </span>yq

yq <span>eval</span> <span>-o</span><span>=</span>json openapi.yaml <span>&gt;</span> openapi.json
</code></pre></div>
<p>Don't worry this is just for playing around, all of the tooling that uses JSONPath will support YAML without bodges like this. Let's just get on the same page for this guide.</p>

<h3 id="querying-openapi-with-jsonpath">Querying OpenAPI with JSONPath</h3>

<p>Once you have a JSON file to work with, we can use the <code>jpp</code> command, pass in a JSON/YAML document, and provide a JSONPath expression to query the document for specific parts.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>jpp <span>--pretty</span> <span>'$.info'</span> openapi.json

<span>[</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>"title"</span>: <span>"Train Travel API"</span>,
    <span>"description"</span>: <span>"API for finding and booking train trips across Europe."</span>,
    <span>"version"</span>: <span>"1.0.0"</span>,
    <span>"contact"</span>: <span>{</span>
      <span>"name"</span>: <span>"Train Support"</span>,
      <span>"url"</span>: <span>"https://example.com/support"</span>,
      <span>"email"</span>: <span>"<a href="https://bump.sh/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="9eedebeeeef1eceadefbe6fff3eef2fbb0fdf1f3">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>"</span>
    <span>}</span>,
    <span>"license"</span>: <span>{</span>
      <span>"name"</span>: <span>"Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International"</span>,
      <span>"identifier"</span>: <span>"CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0"</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In this example <code>$</code> refers to the root JSON document, then <code>.info</code> is using dot notation to access the <code>info</code> key in that object.</p>

<p>We can get a bit more advanced, and pull up a list of paths.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>jpp <span>--pretty</span> <span>'$.paths.*~'</span> openapi.json

<span>[</span>
  <span>"/stations"</span>,
  <span>"/trips"</span>,
  <span>"/bookings"</span>,
  <span>"/bookings/{bookingId}"</span>,
  <span>"/bookings/{bookingId}/payment"</span>
<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This uses the <code>.*</code> syntax which is basically grabbing all children of the paths object, then using <code>~</code> to grab the keys instead of the values.</p>

<p>What sort of query language would JSONPath be if we could not do queries? Let's pull up a list of paths which are a <code>get</code> or a <code>post</code>, but ignore all the <code>put</code>, <code>patch</code>, <code>delete</code>, etc.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>jpp <span>--pretty</span> <span>'$.paths[?(@.put || @.post)]~'</span> openapi.json

<span>[</span>
  <span>"/bookings"</span>,
  <span>"/bookings/{bookingId}/payment"</span>
<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="openapi-overlays-powered-by-jsonpath">OpenAPI Overlays powered by JSONPath</h2>

<p>One of the main uses for JSONPath will be for working OpenAPI documents, often by technical writers or other folks in the API governance space to check or improve OpenAPI documents.</p>

<p>Overlays are a list of actions, which make up a "target" which is a JSONPath, and an operation of either "update" or "remove".</p>

<p>Let's look at an update command.</p>
<div><pre><code><span># overlays.yaml</span>

<span>overlay</span><span>:</span> <span>1.0.0</span>
<span>info</span><span>:</span>
  <span>title</span><span>:</span> <span>Overlay to customise API for Protect Earth</span>
  <span>version</span><span>:</span> <span>0.0.1</span>
<span>actions</span><span>:</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>target</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>$.info'</span>
    <span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>Update description and contact for our audience.</span>
    <span>update</span><span>:</span>
      <span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>&gt;</span>
        <span>A new and much more interesting long form description, which has all sorts of</span>
        <span>Markdown, or more specifically [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) which</span>
        <span>is _like_ Markdown but **better**, because it's an actual standard instead of a</span>
        <span>series of sometimes vaguely consistent conventions.</span>

        <span>Anyway, this is a good place to write all sorts of helpful stuff, link to other</span>
        <span>getting started content, link to where people can find access tokens, or even</span>
        <span>paste some code samples for getting your first API request off the ground.</span>

      <span>contact</span><span>:</span>
        <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>Support Team</span>
        <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>https://example.com/contact</span>
        <span>email</span><span>:</span> <span><a href="https://bump.sh/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="6b181e1b1b04191f2b0e130a061b070e4504190c">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>This overlays file is pointing to the JSONPath target <code>$.info</code>, then updating the object with the new bits of OpenAPI for <code>description</code> and <code>contact</code>, as per the <a href="https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">OpenAPI specification</a>. This can be handy for improving the quality of all sorts of descriptions, not just info, and for popping in support team contact information if the API developers inevitably forgot to mention that sort of thing.</p>

<p>Instead of using those <code>yq</code> or <code>jpp</code> tools we grabbed just to practice, we can use the <a href="https://github.com/bump-sh/cli" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Bump.sh CLI</a> which has support for Overlays built in, and thankfully it'll work just fine with YAML or JSON.</p>
<div><pre><code>npm <span>install</span> <span>-g</span> bump-cli

bump overlay openapi.yaml overlays.yaml <span>&gt;</span> openapi.new.yaml
</code></pre></div>
<p>If we were to run that overlay on the Train Travel API, the resulting <code>openapi.new.yaml</code> would like like this:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>openapi</span><span>:</span> <span>3.1.0</span>
<span>info</span><span>:</span>
  <span>title</span><span>:</span> <span>Train Travel API</span>
  <span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>&gt;</span>
    <span>A new and much more interesting long form description, which has all sorts</span>
    <span>of  Markdown, or more specifically [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/)</span>
    <span>which  is _like_ Markdown but **better**, because its an actual standard</span>
    <span>instead of a  series of sometimes vaguely consistent conventions.</span>

    <span>Anyway, this is a good place to write all sorts of helpful stuff, link to</span>
    <span>other getting started content, link to where people can find access tokens,</span>
    <span>or even paste some code samples for getting your first API request off the</span>
    <span>ground.</span>
  <span>version</span><span>:</span> <span>1.0.0</span>
  <span>contact</span><span>:</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>Support Team</span>
    <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>https://example.com/contact'</span>
    <span>email</span><span>:</span> <span><a href="https://bump.sh/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="384b4d4848574a4c785d40595548545d16574a5f">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></span>
  <span>license</span><span>:</span>

    <span>identifier</span><span>:</span> <span>CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0</span>
<span># snipped</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>When combined with more advanced queries you can start to get really specific with bits of the OpenAPI document you'd like to update, enabling all sorts of random use cases like cleaning up the servers list for publishing an API Catalogue, removing Development and Staging servers not accessible or relevant to API consumers.</p>
<div><pre><code><span># openapi.yaml</span>
<span>openapi</span><span>:</span> <span>3.1.0</span>
<span>servers</span><span>:</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>http://localhost:3000</span>
    <span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>Development</span>

  <span>-</span> <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>https://api-staging.example.com</span>
    <span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>Staging</span>

  <span>-</span> <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>https://api.example.com</span>
    <span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>Production</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>An overlay can target the servers array with <code>$.servers</code> then query through them with <code>$.servers[?(@.description=="Development" || @.description=="Staging")]</code>, which is looking through objects in the array, and looking through the children for <code>description: Development</code> or <code>description: Staging</code> using basically JavaScript syntax.</p>

<p>The Overlay for this would combine that JSONPath target with <code>remove: true</code> operation like this:</p>
<div><pre><code><span># overlays.yaml</span>
<span>overlay</span><span>:</span> <span>1.0.0</span>
<span>info</span><span>:</span>
  <span>title</span><span>:</span> <span>Overlay to customise API</span>
  <span>version</span><span>:</span> <span>0.0.1</span>
<span>actions</span><span>:</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>target</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>$.servers[?(@.description=="Development"</span><span> </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>@.description=="Staging")]'</span>
    <span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>Remove Development and Staging servers but leave anything else.</span>
    <span>remove</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>That would leave this resulting OpenAPI.</p>
<div><pre><code><span># openapi.yaml</span>
<span>openapi</span><span>:</span> <span>3.1.0</span>
<span>servers</span><span>:</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>https://api.example.com</span>
    <span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>Production</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then the Developer Experience folks decide to roll out a Mocking or Sandbox experience, where consumers can play around with requests without actually triggering real emails, real data, or spending real money, but how can we show everyone where that is? Do we have to go and pester all the API teams to add it? Nope, just add another action.</p>
<div><pre><code><span># overlays.yaml</span>
<span>overlay</span><span>:</span> <span>1.0.0</span>
<span>info</span><span>:</span>
  <span>title</span><span>:</span> <span>Overlay to customise API</span>
  <span>version</span><span>:</span> <span>0.0.1</span>
<span>actions</span><span>:</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>target</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>$.servers[?(@.description=="Development"</span><span> </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>@.description=="Staging")]'</span>
    <span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>Remove Development and Staging servers but leave anything else.</span>
    <span>remove</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>

  <span>-</span> <span>target</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>$.servers'</span>
    <span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>Let everyone know about our amazing new hosted mocking/sandbox server.</span>
    <span>update</span><span>:</span>
      <span>-</span> <span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>Sandbox</span>
        <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>https://api-sandbox.example.com/</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="leaning-more-about-jsonpath">Leaning more about JSONPath</h3>

<p>JSONPath made it to IETF "proposed standard" RFC status in 2024 (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">RFC 9535</a>), but before then it was in a similar position to <a href="https://philsturgeon.com/state-of-markdown/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Markdown in the days before CommonMark</a>, in that there are a few different variations of JSONPath as a concept.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JSONPath "The Blog Post"</a> - Written by Stefan Gössner in 2007.</li>
<li><a href="https://jsonpath.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">jsonpath.com</a> - An online evaluator which as far as I can tell matches the blog post.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonpath-plus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JSONPath-Plus</a> - A popular (but now abandoned) fork which expands on the original specification to add some additional operators.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nimma" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Nimma</a> - A fork of JSONPath Plus created by the Stoplight team for Spectral to handle more advanced use cases. A list of caveats can be found here.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then to further compound this confusion, all of the implementations have different support for certain features, and have filled in the grey areas differently due to their own interpretations and community requests. The amazing <a href="https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JSONPath Comparison project</a> has collated all of the differences into a massive test suite and published the results, which was really helpful in shaping the new standard. Hopefully this will help tools converge, and we can forget all about this incompatibility.</p>

<p>For now, try to follow the RFC 9535 syntax, and use tooling which lines up with that syntax. Unfortunately that means not using <code>jsonpath.com</code>, and even the <code>jpp</code> CLI tool we used earlier is JSONPath Plus, which has a few differences to the RFC...</p>

<p>The Bump.sh CLI <code>overlays</code> functionality is JSONPath RFC 9535 compliant, and if you spot any valid RFC JSONPath syntax not working as expected please <a href="https://github.com/bump-sh/cli/issues" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">create an issue on GitHub</a> so we can get that sorted out.</p>

<section>
<p>Some of you might remember the <a href="https://github.com/docker/cli/issues/267#issuecomment-695149477" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legendary comment of Eric Diven</a> on a Docker CLI issue he opened years ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@solvaholic: Sorry I missed your comment of many months ago. I no longer build software; I now make furniture out of wood. The hours are long, the pay sucks, and there’s always the opportunity to remove my finger with a table saw, but nobody asks me if I can add an RSS feed to a DBMS, so there’s that :-)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I say <em>legendary</em> because it has over 9000 reactions and most are positive. There’s a reason why so many devs resonate with that comment.</p>
<p>A lot of us said at some point things like <em>“I’m gonna throw my laptop out the window and start a farm”</em>. Even my last team leader sent me a message out of the blue saying <em>“I think I’ll run a bar. I want to be a bartender and listen to other people’s stories, not figure out why protobuf doesn’t deserialize data that worked JUST FINE for the past three years”</em>.</p>
<p>You know the drill, sometimes the world of software development feels so absurd that you just want to buy a hundred alpaca and sell some wool socks and forget about solving conflicts in <code>package.json</code> for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>I went through those stages too: when the Agile meetings at my last job got so absurd that we were being asked to estimate JIRA task time in T-shirt sizes, I took the decision to quit that comfy well paying job for the uncertainty of making a living from macOS apps. <em>I had only one app that didn’t even work on the latest Apple Silicon chips, and it was making $0, so I really took a bet with it.</em></p>
<p>Recently, when people started coming with so many unrealistic and absurd expectations and demands about what my apps should do, I started thinking if it would be possible to leave software development for a more physical trade.</p>
<h2 id="a-bit-of-history"><a href="#a-bit-of-history">#</a> A bit of history</h2>
<p>Most of my pre-college time was spent on things I didn’t want to do.</p>
<p>I had a bit of childhood, but then I started going to school 6 hours per day, with 1-2 hours spent on commute after 5th grade. I only liked the 10-minute breaks between classes where I played basketball or practiced parkour.</p>
<p>Every day after I came back from school, I had to work in agriculture, either out in the field with crazy winds and sun and UV radiation, or inside a 100-meter long greenhouse where it’s either a 50°C sauna or a muddy rainforest. I was very bad at every job I was given, but it’s what my parents did for a living and I had to help them, no questions asked.</p>
<p>The few hours that remained, usually very late at night, tired both physically and mentally, I spent practicing acoustic guitar, doing bodybuilding exercises, writing bad poetry or drawing graphite portraits.</p>

<p>I almost never did homework or memorize whatever had to be memorized for the next day of school. I just couldn’t justify spending those few hours I had left on even more stuff I did not want to do.</p>
<p>When I found my liberty in college, hundreds of kilometers away from my parents, it’s like something clicked. I suddenly became incapable of doing work that I found meaningless.</p>
<p>Failing classes became acceptable, quitting jobs was something I did with little remorse if I felt I wasn’t helping anyone with the work I was assigned, and bureaucracy became a disease I had to avoid at all costs.</p>
<p><em>I still washed the dishes though. Cleaning and other “chores” never felt meaningless for some reason.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-first-wood-thing-i-did"><a href="#the-first-wood-thing-i-did">#</a> The first wood thing I did</h2>
<p>… was a chess board and piece set. With magnets inside them. Where the pieces look nothing like ordinary chess pieces.</p>

<p>I was trying to get the pieces to snap into place in a satisfying way, and make sure the game stays that way when kids or dogs inevitably bump the table where the board sits.</p>
<p>You know how Magnus Carlsen always adjusts his pieces so meticulously before a game? Well I have half of that obsession as well so I wanted to avoid doing that.</p>

<h3 id="how-it-was-done"><a href="#how-it-was-done">#</a> How it was done</h3>
<p>I started with a cheap but hefty pine board which I rounded with a lot of sandpaper. Then I asked my wife to help me colour in the darker squares because I’m pretty bad at colouring inside the edges <em>(both literally and figuratively)</em>. We used some wood floor markers for that and the colour seems to be holding well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most chess board builds you see on YouTube are done by gluing squares of different wood species with alternating colors, but I had neither the skill nor the tools to do that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I drilled holes for the super strong neodymium magnets from the underside of the board, having to get really close to the top side without passing through. I failed on two squares, but some wood putty took care of that.</p>

<p>I spent a few sunny days on the balcony sculpting the pieces with a badly sharpened knife and my Dremel. This was quite satisfying, there’s something really nice about seeing a non-descript rectangle take the shape of a little horse in your hands. I mean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_%28chess%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knight</a>, but in Romanian that piece is called “horse”, and I really don’t see any knight there.</p>

<p>Regarding the design, I got some inspiration after seeing these <a href="http://www.chess-museum.com/modern-and-modernist---special-show.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modernist chess sets</a>, which not only looked beautiful in my eyes, but also had these geometric shapes that didn’t need that much sculpting to replicate. I found ready-to-buy spheres and cubes of wood at a craft shop around me <em>(which took care of pawns and rooks)</em>, and the rest were carved out of rectangles and cones of wood.</p>

<h2 id="kaval"><a href="#kaval">#</a> Kaval</h2>
<p>Two Octobers ago, a Romanian music band called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OkPq67c3ik" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Subcarpați</a> was holding a free <em>“make a Kaval with your own hands”</em> course, where a flute artisan taught the basics of his trade for a week.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Kaval or “caval” is a long flute with 5 holes and a distinct lower register where notes can sound melancholic and coming from far away, as opposed to the thin cheerful sound of the small shepherd flute.</p>
</blockquote>

<figcaption>Kaval sample in G minor</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Ever since I bought my first Kaval, I always wanted to learn how to build one myself. It’s one of those trades where there’s very little info on the internet, so it feels almost mystical compared to what I’m used to in programming. I would also have the chance to walk home with the finished flute, so of course I went to the course.</p>

<p>I loved the fact that we worked in teams of two, and that everything had to be done by hand with no power tools. Even the long bore through the 70cm branch of elder tree had to be done with a hand drill, taking turns to rest our hands.</p>
<p>The artisan had been a shepherd himself since childhood, and taught himself with a lot of trial and error about how to build good sounding flutes and how to make the holes so that the flute stays in tune. But he didn’t know <em>why</em> the holes should be at those specific distances or why the wood tube should be of that specific length for each scale.</p>
<p>I wanted to know those things, because I had an idea of making a universal Kaval that can play in any scale.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You see, if you want to play on top of songs in various scales, you need a Kaval made for each specific scale. So you’ll need an A minor flute, and a B minor one and a C minor one and so on, for a total of 12 different flute lengths.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I eventually found info on <a href="https://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/fluteacoustics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how a flute works</a> by thinking about it as an open or closed tube where the vibrating air creates nodes and antinodes that should coincide with the hole position. At the moment I’m still studying this and working towards my “universal flute” goal.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-this-have-to-do-with-software"><a href="#what-does-this-have-to-do-with-software">#</a> What does this have to do with software?</h2>
<p>For the past 10 years I lived in rented apartments, usually at the 3rd or 4th story with no access to a courtyard. I was never able to get used to that, given that all my childhood I lived and played in a 2000m² courtyard, on a road where there were more slow horse carriages than noisy cars.</p>
<p>This year I moved into a rented house with a tiny but welcoming garden and a bit of paved court and only now I notice the effect this has had on my mind and behaviour.</p>
<p>I develop <a href="https://lowtechguys.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">macOS apps</a> for a living, and there are some unhealthy things in this field that piled up over the years. I get a lot of messages in a demanding and negative tone, and because walking outside the apartment meant unbearable car noise, obnoxious smells and zero privacy, I always defaulted to simply acting on the feedback, putting up with it and working long hours into the night, instead of going for a walk to calm down.</p>
<p>A few months ago, the most absurd demands started coming up for my apps: things like <em>“why does your app not control the volume of my &lt;weird sound device&gt;? why don’t you just do it, people pay you for it”</em> when the app in question is <a href="https://lunar.fyi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lunar</a>, an app for controlling <strong>monitor brightness</strong>, not sound devices.</p>
<p>Or <em>“why do you disable your apps from working on Windows?”</em>, or <em>“make Clop compress text and copy it to clipboard”</em> (where <a href="https://lowtechguys.com/clop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clop</a> is my app that automatically compresses copied images, videos and PDFs, I have no idea what compressing text even means in that context).</p>
<p>But this time, I was able to simply walk out the front door, grab a branch of beech wood, and, because I remembered my wife saying we forgot to package the french rolling pin when moving, I took out my pocket knife and started carving a simple rolling pin for her. It was so liberating to be able to just ignore those messages for a while and do something with my hands.</p>

<p>I understand that those people don’t know better, and they would have no idea that there’s no checkbox where you can choose whether an app works on macOS, Windows or Linux. I understand how if the app does <em>something</em> with audio volume or compression, some think that it should do <em>everything</em> related to those workloads, even if it’s completely outside the scope of the app.</p>
<p>But the combination of the <strong>negative tone</strong> and <strong>getting message after message</strong>, some people being so persistent that they insist on sending me those messages through all possible mediums <em>(email, Discord, Twitter, contact form, they’ll find me everywhere)</em>, makes it hard to just ignore them.</p>
<p>There’s also this oily smell of AI and machine learning in the tech atmosphere, where I no longer feel relevant and I seem to have stopped caring about new tech when I noticed that 8 in 10 articles are about some new LLM or image generation model. I guess I like the smell of wood better.</p>
<h3 id="side-tangent-on-privileges-of-being-a-software-dev"><a href="#side-tangent-on-privileges-of-being-a-software-dev">#</a> Side tangent on privileges of being a software dev</h3>
<p>I know I’m privileged to even be able to have the choice of what to do with my time. I got lucky when I chose a computer science university at the right time which allowed me to progress towards a huge semi-passive income in the last 10 years. <em>that doesn’t mean I didn’t work my ass off, but luck plays a huge role too</em></p>
<p>I got <em>“lucky”</em> to have my mind traumatised into some kind of OCD-like state where I hate leaving a thing unfinished. So I plow through exhaustion, skip meals, miss house chores and annoy dear people around me because I know <strong>“I just need to fix this little thing”</strong> and I’ll finish this app/feature/task I started. Even though I also know there’s no real deadline and I can leave it half-finished for now.</p>
<p>But even if it sounds annoying for a person like me to whine about how I don’t feel good or I feel burnt out, the privilege doesn’t negate the feelings. The regression to the norm will make everyone, rich or poor, get used to the status quo and complain about every thing that’s just a little worse than their current state. That’s happiness and sadness in a nutshell.</p>
<p>I’m also vaguely aware that software dev as we know it is about to disappear soon, and I got tired of learning the newest thing just to have it replaced next year. I got tired of back pain and chronic finger pain from so many hours of sitting and typing, I’d rather have pain from work that also builds some muscle.</p>
<p>And I got so tired of everything being online, immaterial, ephemeral and lonely, like indie development tends to be.</p>
<hr>

<p>This house we rented is small and the owners had to fit the bedroom upstairs. I really don’t like climbing stairs up and down, especially when I have to let my dog out three times per night. So we gave up a room and started furnishing our own bedroom downstairs.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to buy bedside tables for the price of the bed itself, so I thought I could maybe make by own. <em>I’m not yet skilled enough to build my own bed though, so we bought that</em></p>
<p>One day, while walking with my dog, I noticed that some trees were getting trimmed in the vicinity of our house and there were a lot of white birch branches on the side of the road. I said <strong>why not?</strong>, grabbed some branches and walked like a lunatic with white long sticks dangling up and down and a black dog zig-zagging left and right, all the way home.</p>
<p>I had another small pine panel left from that chess project so I started thinking about the simplest way to turn what I have into a bedside table.</p>

<p>I used low-grit sandpaper to give the board some nice round corners because I love <a href="https://webflow.com/blog/squircle-vs-rounded-squares" target="_blank" rel="noopener">squircles</a>, <em>swallowed about a spoonful of sawdust because I couldn’t find any breathing mask left</em>, criss-crossed 4 branches in a way that would give a stable base, and screwed them to the underside of the board with long wood screws.</p>
<p>The legs would wobble around though, so I drilled small 3mm holes into each branch where they met in the middle, and weaved a florist wire through them to keep the table steady.</p>

<h3 id="the-laptop-bed-table"><a href="#the-laptop-bed-table">#</a> The laptop bed table</h3>
<p>After I’ve shown the bedside table to a friend of mine, he said he also needed a laptop table for those mornings when he’d rather not get out of bed. I wanted to say <em>that’s not very healthy</em>, but what got out instead was <em>sure thing, I’ll do it!</em>. Oh well..</p>
<p>I still had the large desk top I glued from smaller beech boards, on which I worked for the past 4 years. It stayed unused currently, so I cut part of it and built this cute thing:</p>

<p>You’ll notice three defining features that every laptop table should have:</p>
<ul>
<li>a hole for a charging cable</li>
<li>a carved coaster for the coffee cup</li>
<li>a mildly surprised face? 😦</li>
</ul>
<p>To tell the truth, all those are side effects of me drilling holes where there should be no hole, and dropping the board on the ground multiple times because my workbench was not large enough. All the things that could go wrong, went wrong with this table.</p>
<p>I hid the defects by turning them into features.</p>
<p>The whole truth actually is that the table looks nothing like what I planned. I bought these nice hidden brass cylindrical hinges to make the table foldable. That way, you could fold the sides flat inside and use it as some kind of armchair desk if you wanted.</p>

<p>I wasn’t able to drill the correctly sized or positioned holes for the hinges because I still lack a lot of knowledge and skill in working with wood. So after losing my temper with the frickin’ hinges that still didn’t fit after a full day of drilling and chiseling, I glued the sides and inserted 2 trusty long wood screws per side, which I patched with a glue gun that made the screw holes look like eyes.</p>
<p>After I also carved the handles, the table grew kind of a personality of its own, as you can see above.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Why didn’t I do some wood joints, like a dovetail instead of ugly screws and glue?</strong></p>
<p>Because I had no idea they existed. Also, I wasn’t able to fit a simple hinge, I would have probably never finished this table if I tried learning wood joinery on it.</p>
<p>This reminds me of how whenever I did pair programming with a colleague, I noticed how they were doing some <em>“nonoptimal”</em> action and I would say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why don’t you just use <code>ripgrep</code> instead of sifting through all these files?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because they don’t know it exists, stupid. Or because they just want to get this thing done and move on, they don’t <code>grep</code> files all day like you do.</p>
<p>But in my ignorance, I seem to have chosen a good enough joining method. As you can see in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWFyBCkwLOQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wood joinery comparison</a>, 5cm (2inch) screws can hold more than 50kg (110lbs) of force, and I used even longer screws so I think it’s going to hold a 3kg laptop just fine.</p>
<hr>
<p>Oh right, forgot about this little detail.. I also added a cork pocket for holding a notebook, tablet, phone etc. which I lined with a microfiber cloth on the inside for strength and sewn to the wood with that leftover alpaca wool for style.</p>

<p>While we were stuck in the apartment in the 2020 pandemic, me and my wife bought a lot of stuff that we thought would help us learn new things and start new hobbies. <em>I thought I’m going to build smart LED lighting all my life and my wife would become a professional wool knitter.</em> We were losing our minds, for sure.</p>
<p>So now we were stuck with crates of stuff we haven’t used in years, and didn’t want to start unpacking them around the house. The clutter that followed after the pandemic, tired our minds just as much as the lockdown itself.</p>
<p>We dumped the crates on an unused stairway spot, and I thought that a bookshelf as large as that spot would clear the clutter.</p>

<p>But I could not find any bookshelf that large, certainly not for cheap. So I traced a few lines in <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/freeform/id6443742539" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freeform</a>, took some measurements, and ordered a bunch of large pine boards and a ton of long screws.</p>
<p><em>I also ordered the cheapest portable workbench I could find ($30) that had a vise, so I can stop making sawdust inside.</em></p>
<p>A few days later, I got to sawing the shelves with my cheap Japanese pull saw I bought from Lidl years ago.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hint: Hand sawing a long wood board with no skill will certainly end up with a crooked edge. Stacking up 5 boards one on top of the other will still end up crooked.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Uhm, I guess the hint is, buy a track saw, or make sure the crooked edge isn’t visible.</p>

<p>My wife helped a lot with measuring and figuring out where to drill holes and place the screws, while my dog inspected the work regularly to make sure the defects were hidden correctly.</p>
<p>It took two days of screwing.. erm.. driving screws, I mean. But in the end we got the result we wanted! <em>And I got sores in my right arm for days, driving those long screws is harder than I thought.</em></p>

<li>a red no-name plane I found in the shed of that 100-year old house that we never finished rebuilding</li>
<li>an axe I found rusted and partly broken in the same shed, on which I learnt how to sharpen and restore axes</li>
<li>a folding japanese pull saw that I take everywhere with me</li>
<li>some grip blocks on which I place boards for sanding</li>
<li>a bottle of Osmo Polyx oil I use for finishing</li>
<li>a set of carving knives from Beavercraft (really good and they were available at a nice discount)</li>
<li>a combination square (tucked somewhere at the top of the bench)</li>
<li>a branch of elder tree, which is prepared for drilling a hole through it for making a kaval</li>
</ul>
<p>I also own some no-name chisels that work well enough and some card scrapers that I still struggle sharpening.</p>
<p>The only power tools I have are a <a href="https://www.makitauk.com/product/ddf487.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Makita drill</a> and a <a href="https://www.makitauk.com/product/dbo180.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">random orbit sander</a> on which I did spend some money, an old circular saw I found in that old shed <em>(it was good enough to cut miters on that laptop table)</em> and a Dremel I use rarely because I don’t like its power cord. I prefer battery powered tools.</p>
<h2 id="the-window-bench"><a href="#the-window-bench">#</a> The window bench</h2>
<p>Our dog Cora loves sitting at the window, growling at old people and barking at children passing around. Yeah, she’s terrified of children for some reason.</p>
<p>But the window sill is not wide enough and her leg kept falling with a <em>“clang”</em> on the radiator below. So I widened it by placing two glued up boards of pine on top of the radiator, that I planed and smoothed beforehand.<br>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is when I learned that a hand plane is not some antique tool that nobody uses anymore, but a quite versatile piece that can easily smoothen grain where I would waste 5 sheets of sandpaper and choke on sawdust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had to still let the heat radiate somehow, so I drilled large holes with a <a href="https://sawsonskates.com/forstner-bit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forstner bit</a>, but I also blew the grain fibers on the underside because I had no idea of this possible problem. Turns out there is a simple solution to drilling large holes without ripping the fibers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Drill a small 3-6mm hole in the center with a normal wood drill, all the way to the other side <em>(this will help see where the forstner bit should be place from both sides)</em></li>
<li>Place the forstner bit in the hole <em>(this also helps with keeping the bit centered)</em> and drill the large hole, stopping midway through the board</li>
<li>Turn the board around and repeat step 2 until you meet the other end of the hole</li>
</ol>
<p>We also wanted to sit with Cora and there was not much space between the bed and the radiator, so I built a narrow bench. I used another two pine boards of the same size, but this time glued them on the side to create a wider board.</p>
<p>For the legs, well the tree trimming continued near us, so one day I found some thick cherry branches which I brought home, scraped the bark from them, then attached them to the bench using screws from the top side.</p>
<p>I was ok with a <em>rustic</em> look so I didn’t spend much on finishing, patching holes, or even proper wood drying. I did use the hand plane to chamfer the edges though, I love taking those thin continuous wood shavings from the edge.</p>

<p>We recently visited my parents, and loved how the grass finally started growing in some spots where their house and court renovation was finished and was no longer spewing cement dust. It was an abnormally sunny April and I wanted to chat with them at a coffee outside in the early morning before they started the field work, but there was nowhere to place the coffee outside.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First world problems right? If you read about <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The tail end</a>, you might already understand why a trivial thing like coffee time with my parents feels so important to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So one day, while walking on a gravel road near their house, I noticed one neighbour had these huge logs of beech that were recently cut. I thought that would be easy to turn into a small exterior coffee table, so I went to ask if I could buy one.</p>
<p>Well I kind of had to yell <em>“HELLO!”</em> at their gate because I didn’t know their name, and did that a few times until a seemingly sleepy old man appeared at the front door <em>(it was 5 PM)</em> asking what I want. I asked how much he’d want for one of those logs, but he just said to get one, no money needed. Ok, there’s no point in insisting, I chose a wide enough but not too wide log, because these things are heavy and I wasn’t sure I could lift it, and rolled it slowly back home.</p>
<p>I didn’t have my usual tools at my parents house, so I improvised. I found a battered cleaver which my dad used for chopping kindling for the barbecue. I sharpened it as well as I could, then used a hammer to roll a burr on the back of the cleaver that I could use for scraping.</p>

<p>Beech wood has such a smooth hard wood under the bark that it didn’t even need sanding. I used my dad’s power planer to smooth out the top and make a quasi-flat surface then finished it with some walnut oil and it was (almost) ready!</p>
<p>Because the wood was so green, it was certain that it will crack and roughen as it dried. So I cut a groove and wrapped a flat iron band around the top to keep it from moving too much. The bottom can expand as much as it wants, I’m actually quite curious to watch the table morph throughout the summer as we use it.</p>

<p>Because we were born in villages that aren’t that far apart, me and my wife always visit both our parents in the same trip. This time when I got to my parents-in-law, I took a stroll through their little orchard. They added new trees this year! I can’t wait to taste the large apricots.</p>
<p>What struck me as odd about the orchard was that there was no patch of grass to lay on. They like digging up the soil every year, and leaving it like that: an arid looking patch of land made of dry dirt boulders. I thought a bench would be a good solution and what do you know, there was an old broken door thrown in the firewood pile just outside the orchard, that had the perfect length and width for a bench.<br>
I forgot to take a photo of the door, but it looked kind of like this one, only worse and with a large rhomboid ◊ hole at the top.</p>

<p>I got to work immediately, dismantling the door piece by piece and pulling out nail after nail <em>(they really liked their nails in those old times)</em>. I was left with two long and narrow wooden boards, a pile of rotten wood and two pocketfuls of rusted nails.</p>
<p>I sawed the broken ends of the boards, then I used my father-in-law’s power planer to remove the old gray wood from the top, bottom and sides to get to the fresh wood below. <em>There were a lot of holes and valleys so I had to scrape them by hand with sandpaper rolled around a screwdriver.</em> This took a few more days than I expected, but I eventually got two cleanish boards of.. fir? pine? No idea.</p>
<p>I used a velcro sandpaper attachment for the battery powered drill to sand out the rotten sides and give the boards a curvy and smooth live edge.</p>

<p>For the legs, I stole some more firewood from their pile, where I found some thick branches of unidentified species that were roughly the same length. Stripping the bark with an axe made them look good enough so I screwed them at the four corners of the board. The bench was wobbly with just the legs, so I strengthened it sideways by adding shorter and thinner branches of more unidentified wood between the legs and the center of the board.</p>
<p>I had to do something with the rhomboid ◊ hole, so I filled it with a square 4-by-4 salvaged from a recently dismantled shed, and now the bench has 5 legs. Instead of sawing the leg to size, I left it protruding above the bench and placed another thick salvaged board on top of it to serve as an arm rest, or coffee table, or a place for the bowl of cherries.</p>
<p>For the finish, I burned the bench and the bottom of the legs to get a honey-brown aspect and to make it water resistant. I put a very thin layer of whatever wood lacquer I found in my in-laws shed, just for resistance because I don’t like glossy wood.</p>

<h3 id="kaval-stand"><a href="#kaval-stand">#</a> Kaval stand</h3>
<p>I thought I should finally do something about the kavals always rolling around on some table or couch throughout the house, so I made a stand from long thin wood boards glued on the side, and finished it with sunflower oil to give it a golden/orange colour.</p>
<p>This way I can always expand it by adding more boards to the side if I want to add more flutes.</p>

<h3 id="sharpening-block"><a href="#sharpening-block">#</a> Sharpening block</h3>
<p>I need to sharpen blades almost daily, be it the pocket knife, axe, plane blade or chisels. So I made a custom sharpening block with the perfect tools for my sharpening technique.</p>
<figure>
<video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="">
<source src="https://alinpanaitiu.com/video/sharpening-stone.mp4">
</video>
<figcaption>Sharpening block, diamond plate with leather strop on a beech base</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It has a $5 diamond plate with <code>600</code> grit on one side and a $5 leather strop <em>(a piece of leather belt might work just as well)</em> on the other side. I attached the leather with two small screws at the top so I can take it out easily if I need a flexible strop for my carving gouge for example. It is loaded with diamond paste which can be found for cheap at gemstone cutting online stores <em>(the knife-specific pastes are a lot more expensive and I’m not sure why)</em>.</p>
<p>To be honest, a $0.5 green compound <em>(chromium oxide)</em> works just as well for stropping, that’s what I used before and still use for my detail carving knives. It gives a smoother edge than the diamond, the disadvantage being that it needs to be re-applied more often on the leather and that you need a bit more blade passes to get the same result. The diamonds seem be cutting faster, but really not much faster.</p>
<h4 id="a-bit-of-a-tangent-on-the-sharpening-topic"><a href="#a-bit-of-a-tangent-on-the-sharpening-topic">#</a> A bit of a tangent on the sharpening topic</h4>
<p>I went through all the phases with sharpening tools. I’ve used water stones, natural stones, ceramic stones, pull-through carbide sharpeners <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jJZdGst8wE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(don’t use these)</a></em>, powered belt sharpeners, wheel sharpeners.</p>
<p>Aside from the pull-through sharpeners and the steel rods, all the others work just as well with the right technique. I settled on the diamond plate because they’re cheap, stay flat, need zero maintenance, and can cut through any type of metal. Paired with a leather strop, for me it’s the simplest way to sharpen.</p>
<p>I recommend this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLlPiBSP_1U" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OUTDOORS55 video</a> for a no-bullshit sharpening tutorial and <a href="https://scienceofsharp.com/home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Science of Sharp blog</a> if you’re curious what the different sharpening techniques do to an edge under a microscope.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article aria-label="Article text">
					<p>During the summer of 2023, Dr. Rosemary Lall, a <a href="https://globalnews.ca/tag/family-physician">family physician</a> working at a bustling medical clinic in Scarborough, hit her breaking point.</p><img decoding="async" src="https://d21y75miwcfqoq.cloudfront.net/70c8fc80" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade">
<p>After nearly three decades on the job, Lall was ready to throw in the towel as she found herself buried under inescapable patient-related paperwork that often cut into precious family time.</p><p>“I lost all my joy of work,” Lall told Global News. “I was coming into work really dreading the day.”</p><p>That dread, Lall said, had less to do with the patient experience and instead came from the work associated with the “aftermath” — mandatory record-keeping that front-line health-care workers are expected to input into Ontario’s electronic medical records system.</p><p>Physicians, Lall said, are expected to update patient charts, fill out medical forms, provide sick notes and provide specialist referrals.</p>		<div>							<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
			
			
			

					
		</div>	<p>The administrative burden would often take her up to two hours per day. Ontario’s Medical Association has estimated family doctors spend 19 hours per week on administrative tasks, including four hours spent writing notes or completing forms for patients.</p><p>“I came to a crossroads where I’m going to quit, I’m going to give this up, or I’m going to find a solution,” Lall said.</p><p>The solution, Lall said, was new artificial intelligence note-taking apps that are designed to mimic doctor’s notes and reduce the amount of paperwork a physician would have to manually compile.</p>	<div id="sophi_article_widget" aria-label="More on Health" data-sophi-feature="article-health">

	<p>The AI Scribe program — which is run by OntarioMD, the digital technology arm of the Ontario Medical Association — allows doctors to choose from a handful of tools that act as a note-taking assistant during a patient visit.</p>		<div>

		</p></div>
		<p>Patients who give consent have a routine conversation about their ailment with the physician, while the doctor verbalizes their thoughts during the physical exam. The AI Scribe software is able to create and process a real-time transcript during the appointment.</p><p>Lall said the true benefit comes after the appointment when the AI Scribe compiles the information into a so-called SOAP note, a standard requirement for family physicians as prescribed by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario.</p><p>Artificial intelligence technology separates the information it hears into subjective information, as relayed by the patient, objective information, as relayed by the doctor, assessment information, as verbalized by the physician during a physical exam, and a plan of action for patient care. The four areas — subjective, objective, assessment and plan — make up the acronym SOAP.</p>		<div>							<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
			
			
			

					
		</div>	<p>Lall said it takes minutes for AI Scribe to collate the information, allowing her to move on to other patients while the SOAP note is being created in the background.</p><p>If the physician is unhappy with the note, Lall said, they can ask the AI model to regenerate the information or add more detail to any one of the categories. While the tool has some imperfections, she said, the improvements have been noticeable over the 10 months since she began using it.</p><p>“I really feel this should be the next gold standard for all of our doctors. It decreases the cognitive load you feel at the end of the day,” she said.</p><p>The Ford government has been so impressed with the technology that it announced a pilot program to allow 150 family physicians to use AI Scribe as part of their practices. The health minister said the early signs were promising but stressed the government would proceed carefully.</p><p>“We’re doing it in a very measured way so we can look at those results and see that the impact is there,” Deputy Premier Sylvia Jones told Global News. “Anecdotally, patients really appreciate it. Clinicians are seeing benefits.”</p><p>Still, some have questions about the data collected by AI Scribe, privacy and the potential for misuse.</p><p>“I would have significant concerns if it’s not properly executed,” said Liberal health critic and physician Dr. Adil Shamji.</p>		<div>							<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
			
			
			

					
		</div>	<p>“There are going to be important things to do in terms of ensuring patient confidentiality, ensuring accuracy,” Shaji said. “If it’s going to be truly autonomous with minimal oversight that would need to be very carefully implemented.”</p><p>France Gélinas, the Ontario NDP’s health critic, said artificial intelligence would be “part of the future of health care” in Ontario but needed to be carefully managed.</p><p>“You have to maintain the trusting relationship between the providers and the patient,” she said.</p><p>“That means respect their privacy. Are we there yet? I don’t think so. Will we be there? Absolutely. It will become part but let’s take the proper steps, finish the pilot, see what we learn from it.”</p><p>Lall said that after 29 years as a family physician, last Christmas was the first celebration that wasn’t interrupted by the need to update patient notes thanks to the AI notetaking software.</p><p>“For me, this has changed things,” Lall said. “It’s made me really happy.</p><p>“I will never go back.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    
                    <p>To avoid catastrophic climate impacts, excessive carbon emissions must be addressed. At this point, cutting emissions isn’t enough. Direct air capture, a technology that pulls carbon dioxide out of ambient air, has great potential to help solve the problem.</p>

<p>But there’s a big challenge. For direct air capture technology, every type of environment and location requires a uniquely specific design. A direct air capture configuration in Texas, for example, would necessarily be different from one in Iceland. These systems must be designed with exact parameters for humidity, temperature, and air flows for each place.</p>

<p>Now, Georgia Tech and Meta have collaborated to produce a massive database, potentially making it easier and faster to design and implement direct air capture technologies. The open-source database enabled the team to train an AI model that is orders of magnitude faster than existing chemistry simulations. The project, named <a href="https://open-dac.github.io/">OpenDAC</a>, could accelerate climate solutions the planet desperately needs.</p>

<p>The team’s research was <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.3c01629">published</a> in <em>ACS Central Science</em>, a journal of the American Chemical Society.</p>

<p>“For direct air capture, there are many ideas about how best to take advantage of the air flows and temperature swings of a given environment,” said <a href="https://research.gatech.edu/andrew-medford">Andrew J. Medford</a>, associate professor in the <a href="https://www.chbe.gatech.edu/">School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering</a> (ChBE) and a lead author of the paper. “But a major problem is finding a material that can capture carbon efficiently under each environment’s specific conditions.”</p>

<p>Their idea was to “create a database and a set of tools to help engineers broadly, who need to find the right material that can work,” Medford said. “We wanted to use computing to take them from not knowing where to start to giving them a robust list of materials to synthesize and try.”</p>

<p>Containing reaction data for 8,400 different materials and powered by nearly 40 million quantum mechanics calculations, the team believes it’s the largest and most robust dataset of its kind.</p>

<h3>Building a Partnership (and a Database)</h3>

<p>Researchers with Meta’s <a href="https://ai.meta.com/">Fundamental AI Research (FAIR)</a> team were looking for ways to harness their machine learning prowess to address climate change. They landed on direct air capture as a promising technology and needed to find a partner with expertise in materials chemistry as it relates to carbon capture. They went straight to Georgia Tech.</p>

<p><a href="https://research.gatech.edu/david-s-sholl">David Sholl</a>, ChBE professor, Cecile L. and David I.J. Wang Faculty Fellow, and director of Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/content/transformational-decarbonization-initiative">Transformational Decarbonization Initiative</a>, is one of the world’s top experts in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). These are a class of materials promising for direct air capture because of their cagelike structure and proven ability to attract and trap carbon dioxide. Sholl brought Medford, who specializes in applying machine learning models to atomistic and quantum mechanical simulations as they relate to chemistry, into the project.</p>

<p>Sholl, Medford, and their students provided all the inputs for the database. Because the database predicts the MOF interactions and the energy output of those interactions, considerable information was required.</p>

<p>They needed to know the structure of nearly every known MOF — both the MOF structure by itself and the structure of the MOF interacting with carbon dioxide and water molecules.</p>

<p>“To predict what a material might do, you need to know where every single atom is and what its chemical element is,” Medford said. “Figuring out the inputs for the database was half of the problem, and that’s where our Georgia Tech team brought the core expertise.”</p>

<p>The team took advantage of large collections of MOF structures that Sholl and his collaborators had previously developed. They also created a large collection of structures that included imperfections found in practical materials.</p>

<h3>The Power of Machine Learning</h3>

<p><a href="https://anuroopsriram.com/">Anuroop Sriram</a>, research engineering lead at FAIR and first author on the paper, generated the database by running quantum chemistry computations on the inputs provided by the Georgia Tech team. These calculations used about 400 million CPU hours, which is hundreds of times more computing than the average academic computing lab can do in a year.</p>

<p>FAIR also trained machine learning models on the database. Once trained on the 40 million calculations, the machine learning models were able to accurately predict how the thousands of MOFs would interact with carbon dioxide.</p>

<p>The team demonstrated that their AI models are powerful new tools for material discovery, offering comparable accuracy to traditional quantum chemistry calculations while being much faster. These features will allow other researchers to extend the work to explore many other MOFs in the future.</p>

<p>“Our goal was to look at the set of all known MOFs and find those that most strongly attract carbon dioxide while not attracting other air components like water vapor, and using these highly accurate quantum computations to do so,” Sriram said. “To our knowledge, this is something no other carbon capture database has been able to do.”</p>

<p>Putting their own database to use, the Georgia Tech and Meta teams identified about 241 MOFs of exceptionally high potential for direct air capture.</p>

<h3>Moving Forward With Impact</h3>

<p>“According <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/net-zero-coalition#:~:text=to%202010%20levels.-,To%20keep%20global%20warming%20to%20no%20more%20than%201.5%C2%B0,reach%20net%20zero%20by%202050.">to the UN</a> and most industrialized countries, we need to get to net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050,” said Matt Uyttendaele, director of Meta’s FAIR chemistry team and a co-author on the paper. “Most of that must happen by outright stopping carbon emissions, but we must also address historical carbon emissions and sectors of the economy that are very hard to decarbonize — such as aviation and heavy industry. That’s why CO2 removal technologies like direct air capture must come online in the next 25 years."</p>

<p>While direct air capture is still a nascent field, the researchers say it’s crucial that groundbreaking tools — like the OpenDAC database made available in the team’s paper — are in development now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“There is not going to be one solution that will get us to net-zero emissions,” Sriram said. “Direct air capture has great potential but needs to be scaled up significantly before we can make a real impact. I think the only way we can get there is by finding better materials.”</p>

<p>The researchers from both teams hope the scientific community will join the search for suitable materials. The entire OpenDAC dataset project is open source, from the data to the models to the algorithms.</p>

<p>“I hope this accelerates the development of negative-emission technologies like direct air capture that may not have been possible otherwise,” Medford said. “As a species, we must solve this problem at some point. I hope this work can contribute to getting us there, and I think it has a real shot at doing that.”</p>

<hr>
</div>

<p>I'm working on a new SQLite extension! It's called
<a href="https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec"><code>sqlite-vec</code></a>, an extension for vector
search, written purely in C. It's meant to replace
<a href="https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vss"><code>sqlite-vss</code></a>, another vector search
SQLite extension I released in February 2023, which
<a href="#wrong-sqlite-vss">has a number of problems</a>. I believe the approach I'm taking
with <code>sqlite-vec</code> solves a number of problem it's predecessor has, will have a
much nicer and performant SQL API, and is a better fit for all applications who
want an embed vector search solution!</p>
<h2>What <code>sqlite-vec</code> will be</h2>
<p><code>sqlite-vec</code> will be a SQLite extension written purely in C with no
dependencies. It will provide custom SQL functions and virtual tables for fast
vector search, as well as other tools and utilities for working with vectors
(quantization, JSON/BLOB/numpy conversions, vector arithmetic, etc.).</p>
<p>A quick sample of what vector search will look like with <code>sqlite-vec</code>, in pure
SQL:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span> .</span><span>/</span><span>vec0</span></span>
<span></span>

<span><span>  sample_embedding </span><span>float</span><span>[8]</span></span>
<span><span>);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>-- vectors can be provided as JSON or in a compact binary format</span></span>

<span><span>    (</span><span>4</span><span>, X</span><span>'8FC235BFC3F5A83E9EEF273F9EEF273DA4707DBF23DB393FB81EC53E7D3F75BF'</span><span>);</span></span>

<span><span>1,2.38978505134583</span></span>
<span><span>*/</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Using <code>sqlite-vec</code> means using pure SQL, just <code>CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE</code>,
<code>INSERT INTO</code>, and <code>SELECT</code> statements.</p>
<p>This work is exciting - for many reasons! First off, "written in pure C" means
it will be able to run anywhere. The previous <code>sqlite-vss</code> extension, which had
some cumbersome C++ dependencies, was only able to reliably run on Linux and
MacOS machines, with binaries in the <code>3MB</code>-<code>5MB</code> range. By contrast,
<code>sqlite-vec</code> will run on all platforms (Linux/MacOS/Windows), in the browser
with WebAssembly, and even smaller devices like mobile phones and Raspberry Pis!
Smaller binaries too, in the few 100's of KB range.</p>
<p>Additionally, <code>sqlite-vec</code> has more control over memory usage. By default,
vectors are stored in 'chunks' in shadow tables, and are read chunk-by-chunk
during KNN searches. This means you don't need to store everything in RAM!
Though if you do want in-memory speed, you could use the
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_mmap_size"><code>PRAGMA mmap_size</code></a>
command to make KNN searches much faster.</p>
<p>And finally, <code>sqlite-vec</code> is built in a new "era" of vector search tooling and
research. There will be better support for "adative-length embeddings" (aka
<a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/matryoshka">Matryoshka embeddings</a>), and
<code>int8</code>/<code>bit</code> vector support for
<a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/embedding-quantization">binary and scalar quantization</a>.
This means more control over the speed, accuracy, and disk space that your
vectors take up.</p>
<p>Though initially, <code>sqlite-vec</code> will only support exhaustive full-scan vector
search. There will be no "approximate nearest neighbors" (ANN) options. But I
hope to add IVF + HNSW in the future!</p>
<h2>Demo</h2>
<p>Enough yappin' let's see a demo</p>
<p><code>sqlite-vec</code> is running right now in your browser! If you open up devtools,
you'll see an (un-optimized) <code>5.9MB</code> <code>sqlite3.wasm</code> file, which is the
<a href="https://sqlite.org/wasm/doc/trunk/about.md">official SQLite WASM build</a> with
<code>sqlite-vec</code> compiled in. There is a <code>movies.bit.db</code> SQLite database also
loaded, which is a <code>2.6MB</code> SQLite database, which has
<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_movies.csv">this movies dataset</a>
with 4,800 movie overviews in the <code>articles</code> table. The separate <code>vec_movies</code>
virtual table is a vector index of those "overviews" embedded, with
<a href="https://blog.nomic.ai/posts/nomic-embed-matryoshka">Nomic's 1.5 embeddings model</a>,
quantized to binary vectors.</p>
<p>Here's a quick sample of what the data looks like:</p>

<p>Here we see the <code>articles</code> table has columns like <code>title</code>, <code>release_date</code>, and
<code>overview</code>. The <code>overview</code> column here is important - it's a very short sentence
describing the plot of the movie. We also have the <code>vec_articles</code> virtual table,
which stores embeddings of the <code>articles.overview</code> as the <code>overview_embeddings</code>
column. Thy are binary vectors with 768 dimensions, which takes up 96 bytes
(<code>768 / 8 = 96</code>).</p>
<p>Now let's see how a KNN-style search works! Here's a lil' table select
component. Select a movie with the radio button on the left-hand side.</p>

<p>The movie ID you selected will now pre-populate the <code>:selected_movie</code> SQL
parameter in this KNN SQL query!</p>

<p>Those are the 10 closest movies to the one you selected! The "closest" one
(using hamming distance, because it's a binary vector) will always be the same
movie, with a distance of 0. Keep in mind, embedding a single-sentence plot
description of a small movie dataset doesn't give the best results (and binary
quantization sacrifices even more quality), but the core idea remains. Fast,
"good enough" vector search, in your browser!</p>
<p>More docs about this KNN-style query will come soon, but in case you wanted to
poke around at the internals, try adding a <code>EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN</code> to the beginning
of the <code>SELECT</code> statement. You'll see the <code>0:knn</code> "index" that <code>vec_movies</code>
uses.</p>
<h2 id="wrong-sqlite-vss"> But what's wrong with <code>sqlite-vss</code>?</h2>
<p>I won't go into all the details, but there were a number of roadblocks in the
development and adoption of <code>sqlite-vss</code>, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only worked on Linux + MacOS machines (no Windows, WASM, mobile devices, etc.)</li>
<li>Stored vectors all in-memory</li>
<li>Various transaction-related bugs and issues</li>
<li>Extremely hard and time-consuming to compile</li>
<li>Missing common vector operations (scalar/binary quantization)</li>
</ul>
<p>Nearly all of these are because <code>sqlite-vss</code> depended on
<a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss">Faiss</a>. With a lot of time and
energy, some of these issues could <em>maybe</em> be solved, but many of them would be
blocked by Faiss.</p>
<p>Given all this, a no-dependency and low-level solution seemed really enticing.
Turns out, vector search isn't too complicated, so <code>sqlite-vec</code> was born!</p>
<h2>Still not ready, but soon!</h2>
<p>The core features of <code>sqlite-vec</code> work, but I have very little error handling +
testing. I have 246 TODOs in the <code>sqlite-vec.c</code> file, which I'm tracking with a
lil script:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>$ make progress</span></span>
<span><span>deno run --allow-read=sqlite-vec.c scripts/progress.ts</span></span>
<span><span>Number of todo_assert()'s:      191</span></span>
<span><span>Number of "// TODO" comments:   41</span></span>
<span><span>Number of todo panics:          14</span></span>
<span><span>Total TODOs:                    246</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ (0/246)</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span>0% complete to sqlite-vec v0</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Once those 246 TODOs are completed, then the first <code>v0.1.0</code> of <code>sqlite-vec</code> will
be released, with documentation, demos, bindings, and more! I'm aiming for a
month or so, but we shall see!</p>
<h2>I'm looking for sponsors!</h2>
<p>Is your company interested in the success of <code>sqlite-vec</code>? I'd love to chat!
