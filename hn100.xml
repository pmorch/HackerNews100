<p>Most of these similar things are using the same technique.
Mask out an animated block, putting some animations and probably designed some parts in Figma or other SVG editors.</p>
<p><a href="https://unkey.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unkey</a>'s landing page is a nice example.</p>
<a href="#clerk-toc"><h3 id="clerk-toc"><span>#</span>Clerk TOC</h3></a>
<p>I made a clerk-like style Table Of Contents (TOC) on <a href="https://fumadocs.vercel.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fumadocs</a>, you can try it out and play with the nice TOC.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://fuma-nama.vercel.app/blog/fumadocs-toc.png" alt="preview"></p></div>
<p>To implement it, we have to render the TOC outline on server, without client-side JavaScript to make it compatible with SSR.</p>
<p>Since we're on server, we don't know the exact positions of elements.
My approach is to use <code>absolute</code> positions, render the outline as different "components", and snitch them together.</p>
<p><img src="https://fuma-nama.vercel.app/blog/toc.png" alt="toc"></p>
<p>This isn't hard, but we also want to render a highlighted part of outline where the items are active, or their corresponding heading is visible in the viewport.</p>
<p>Like:</p>
<p><img src="https://fuma-nama.vercel.app/blog/clerk-toc-highlight.png" alt="example"></p>
<p>I'll call it the <strong>thumb</strong>. It has to be animated, so we can't just change the color of these outline components.</p>
<p><img src="https://fuma-nama.vercel.app/blog/toc-2.png" alt="toc"></p>
<p>We cannot animate the thumb with simple CSS solutions, lucky we have the exact rendered positions of TOC items, since the thumb is meant to be interactive, it is <strong>rendered on client!</strong></p>
<p>Using the information from our browser, we can construct a "mask map" on client, look like this:</p>
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 14 236"><path d="M1 0 L1 20 L13 36 L13 56 L1 72 L1 92 L13 108 L13 128 L1 144 L1 164 L1 180 L1 200 L13 216 L13 236" stroke="white" stroke-width="1" fill="none"></path></svg>
<p>The method to construct this map is <strong>SVG</strong> - yes, our old friend.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>&lt;</span><span>svg</span><span> xmlns</span><span>=</span><span>"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"</span><span> viewBox</span><span>=</span><span>"0 0 14 236"</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>  &lt;</span><span>path</span></span>
<span><span>    d</span><span>=</span><span>"M1 0 L1 20 L13 36 L13 56 L1 72 L1 92 L13 108 L13 128 L1 144 L1 164 L1 180 L1 200 L13 216 L13 236"</span></span>
<span><span>    stroke</span><span>=</span><span>"white"</span></span>
<span><span>    strokeWidth</span><span>=</span><span>"1"</span></span>
<span><span>    fill</span><span>=</span><span>"none"</span></span>
<span><span>  /&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;/</span><span>svg</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>d</code> property of SVG <code>&lt;path /&gt;</code> isn't a nonsense auto-generated string, it's a list of commands.
See the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Paths" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Web Docs</a> for more details, it's quite a powerful tool.</p>
<p>With our new tool, we can tell SVG to render a line connecting each point of the outline.</p>
<p><img src="https://fuma-nama.vercel.app/blog/toc-3.png" alt="toc"></p>
<p>This constructed a SVG that's <em>identical</em> to our original TOC outline pre-rendered on server.</p>
<p>Similar to the technique we've learnt from Animated Wires, we can use the CSS <code>mask-image</code> property to mask an animated <code>div</code> block to render the thumb - a highlighted part of outline.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span></span>
<span><span>  style</span><span>=</span><span>{{</span></span>
<span><span>    maskImage: </span><span>`url("data:image/svg+xml,${</span></span>

    <h3>Reporting Highlights</h3>
    <ul>
                    <li><span>Shortchanged: </span> Blue Cross Louisiana OK’d mastectomies and breast reconstructions for women with cancer but refused to pay a hospital’s full bills. For some claims, it paid nothing.</li>
            <li><span>Exceptions: </span> Blue Cross denied payments for thousands of procedures involved in breast reconstruction. But it approved special deals for treatment for executives’ wives.</li>
            <li><span>Verdict: </span> A jury found Blue Cross liable for fraud and awarded the hospital $421 million. The insurance company denied wrongdoing and has appealed.</li>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0">On a late afternoon in November 2017, Witney Arch told her 1-1/2-year-old son to stop playing and come inside. Upset, he grabbed her right breast when she picked him up. She experienced a shock of pain but did not think it was anything serious. A week later, however, the ache had not subsided. After trips to several doctors, a biopsy revealed that Arch had early-stage breast cancer. Her surgeon told her that it was likely invasive and aggressive.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">By the end of January, she had made two critical decisions. She would get a double mastectomy. And she wanted her operation at the Center for Restorative Breast Surgery in New Orleans, a medical facility renowned for its highly specialized approach to breast cancer care and reconstruction. The two surgeons who founded it had pioneered techniques that used a woman’s own body tissue to form new breasts post mastectomy. The idea of a natural restoration appealed to Arch. “I don’t judge anybody for getting implants, especially if you’ve had cancer,” she said. “But I felt like I was taking something foreign out of my body, cancer, and I did not want to put something foreign back in.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">Arch was a 42-year-old preschool teacher for her church, with four young children, living in a suburb of New Orleans. The 1-1/2-year-old had been born with Sturge-Weber syndrome, a rare neurological disorder. Caring for him consumed her life. By nature upbeat and optimistic, Arch felt blessed that her son’s act of defiance had led to an early diagnosis. “We’re going to pray about this and we’re going to figure it out,” she told her husband.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">Arch asked her insurer, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana, for approval to go to the center for her care, and the company granted it, a process known as prior authorization. Then, a week or so before her surgery, Arch was wrangling child care and meal plans when she got a call from the insurer. The representative on the line was trying to persuade her to have the surgery elsewhere. She urged Arch to seek a hospital that, unlike the center, was in network and charged less. “Do you realize how much this is going to cost?” Arch remembered the agent asking. Arch did not need more stress, but here it was — from her own health plan. “I feel very comfortable with my decision,” she replied. “My doctor teaches other doctors around the world how to do this.” Over the next year, Arch underwent five operations to rid herself of cancer and reconstruct her breasts.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">Arch did not know it at the time, but her surgery would become evidence in a long-running legal fight between the breast center’s founders, surgeons Frank DellaCroce and Scott Sullivan, and Blue Cross, Louisiana’s biggest health insurance company, with an estimated two-thirds share of the market. DellaCroce and Sullivan had repeatedly sued the insurer, alleging that it granted approvals for surgery but then denied payments or paid only a fraction of patients’ bills. They pointed to calls like the one Arch received as proof of the company’s effort to drive away patients. The aggressive legal attack, they knew, was fraught. Litigation against the $3.4 billion company would take a long time and a lot of money. The chances of winning were slight. “You fight dragons at great peril,” DellaCroce would tell friends. But this September, after 18 years and several defeats in court, jurors found Blue Cross liable for fraud. They awarded the center $421 million — one of the largest verdicts ever to a single medical practice outside of a class-action lawsuit. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25893394-statement-from-blue-cross-and-blue-shield-of-louisiana/">In a statement</a>, Blue Cross said it “disagrees with the jury’s decision, which we believe was wrong on the facts and the law. We have filed an appeal and expect to be successful.”</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0">Frustration with insurers is at an all-time high. The December fatal shooting of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson allegedly by Luigi Mangione serves as an extreme and tragic example. Doctors and insurers are locked into a perpetual conflict over health care costs, with patients caught in the middle. Doctors accuse insurance plans of blocking payments for health care treatments that can save the patients’ lives. Insurance companies insist they shouldn’t pay for procedures that they say are unnecessary or overpriced. It is easy to emerge from an examination of the American health care system with a cynicism that both sides are broken and corrupt.</p>
        
    
                    
    
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.0">However, interviews with scores of doctors, patients and insurance executives, as well as reviews of internal documents, regulatory filings and academic studies, reveal a fundamental truth: The two sides are not evenly matched. Insurance companies are players in the fight over money, and they are also the referees. Insurers produce their own guidelines to determine whether to pay claims. When a doctor appeals a denial, insurers make all the initial decisions. In legal settings, insurers are often given favorable standing in their ability to set what conditions they are required to cover. Federal and state insurance regulators lack the resources to pursue individual complaints against multibillion-dollar companies. Six major insurers, which include some of the nation’s largest companies, cover half of all Americans. They are pitted against tens of thousands of doctors’ practices and large hospital chains.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">The Blue Cross trial provides a rare opportunity to expose in detail the ways that health insurance companies wield power over doctors and their patients. Blue Cross executives testified that the breast center charged too much money — sometimes more than $180,000 for an operation. The center, they said, deserved special attention because it had a history of questionable charges. But the insurer’s defense went even further, to the very meaning of “prior authorization,” which it had granted women like Arch to pursue surgery. The authorization, they said in court, recognized that a procedure was medically necessary, but it also contained a clause that it was “<em>not</em> a guarantee of payment.” Blue Cross was not obliged to pay the center anything, top executives testified. “Let me be clear: The authorization never says we’re going to pay you,” said Steven Udvarhelyi, who was the CEO for the insurer from 2016 to 2024, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25882446-steven-udvarhelyi-deposition/#document/p1/a2630959">in a deposition</a>. “That’s why there’s a disclaimer.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0">From 2015 through 2023, the Baton Rouge-based insurer paid, on average, less than 9% of the charges billed by the breast center for more than 7,800 individual medical procedures — even though it had authorized all of them. Thousands of such claims were never paid at all, according to court records. Testimony revealed that the health plan never considered thousands of appeals filed by the center. Corporate documents showed Blue Cross executives had set up secret processes for approving operations and reimbursing the clinic and its doctors that resulted in reduced fees and payment delays. One lucrative strategy: A national-level policy allowed Blue Cross Louisiana to take a cut of any savings it achieved in paying the breast center on behalf of patients covered by out-of-state Blue Cross companies, meaning the less the insurer paid out, the more it earned.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="16.0">In Sullivan’s words, the insurer was hypocritical, “morally bankrupt.” Blue Cross had stranded many of the center’s patients with high bills, amounts that it had absorbed over the years. On several occasions, though, Blue Cross executives had signed special one-time deals with the center, known as single case agreements, to pay for their wives’ cancer treatment. To Sullivan, it seemed the insurer was willing to pay the center when patients had connections but would fight when patients did not.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0">Blue Cross declined to comment on any individual cases but said in a statement that single case agreements were “common in the industry” and were available to all members when needed to access out-of-network providers.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0">Nobody would take <a href="https://www.breastcenter.com/">the breast center and its adjoining hospital</a> as an ordinary medical establishment. The two facilities take up a city block along St. Charles Avenue, the thoroughfare famous for its streetcars, Mardi Gras parades and Queen Anne mansions. Patients access the complex — created by merging a former law office, funeral home, car dealership and Dunkin’ Donuts — by driving around back where a porte cochere leads into a soaring atrium. Light pours in through windows set in the high ceiling. Arrangements of white orchids are scattered among comfortable couches and chairs. Here, women consult with doctors to plan their treatment. Surgeries are performed at the 39-bed hospital, which has an Icee machine in a family room. New-age music plays softly throughout the building. Rooms are designed to be as homey as possible, with medical gear hidden away and seascapes by a local artist hanging on the wall. One patient’s husband referred to it as a “spa-spital.”</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0">The idea of combining the luxury feel of an upscale plastic surgery practice with the mission-driven zeal of a medical clinic came to DellaCroce and Sullivan while they were young surgeons. The two grew up in Louisiana. Sullivan spent much of his childhood in Mandeville, a suburb of New Orleans on the north side of Lake Ponchartrain, his dad employed in the oil and gas industry. His mother wanted him to be a priest or a doctor. “I definitely was not going to become a priest,” he said. DellaCroce’s father worked at the paper mill in West Monroe in the state’s northern neck. His mother, a nurse, gave him an appreciation for medicine as a career that was “meaningful and challenging.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0">They became friends while working at the Louisiana State University medical center, where they earned the nickname “the Sushi Brothers” for their favorite lunch. They were drawn to microsurgery and breast reconstruction because it was an emerging field that was innovating and improving care. Both men became board-certified in plastic surgery. Sullivan, 60, is the hard-charging businessman, stocky, direct and blunt. DellaCroce, 58, with a ponytail, goatee and soft drawl, is more the diplomat, patient and cerebral.

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0">They opened their first office in 2003 in a single room rented from a fellow doctor at what was then known as Memorial Medical Center, the hulking private hospital in New Orleans. They performed operations at facilities throughout the region but found that most gave little consideration to their patients’ comfort. They wanted to build a different kind of hospital. “Can we give them that little bit of extra without breaking the budget to make the experience less awful? Can’t make it great, but can you make it less awful?” DellaCroce explained. “Can you attend to the human side of this patient and give them the added value of peace and confidence?” Hurricane Katrina set back their construction plans, and the new edifice, named the St. Charles Surgical Hospital, did not open its doors until 2009. It boasts of being the only hospital in the country devoted solely to care for breast cancer patients who have received mastectomies. The center does not provide radiation or chemotherapy treatments. The majority of patients come from out of state.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0">Women seeking to have their breasts restored after a mastectomy face two paths. Some choose a relatively straightforward surgical procedure using implants filled with silicon or another gel. The center specializes in the other option, what’s known as autologous tissue reconstruction, where a woman’s own fat is taken from one part of the body, like the bottom or the stomach, and used to rebuild the breast. The procedure requires a longer recovery time, but the new breasts become part of the body.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.0">The transplant surgery is lengthy and complex. Operations can last up to 12 hours with big medical teams involved. One surgeon performs the mastectomy while another creates a new breast by knitting together layers of fat and tissue. Concentration is intense. The surgeons stare through glasses with microscopes to connect new blood vessels with a needle that’s thinner than an eyelash, using thread less than half the width of a human hair. DellaCroce and Sullivan invented techniques, for example, allowing tissue to be taken from multiple sites when a woman did not have enough fat in one part of her body for a full restoration.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0">One afternoon last fall, DellaCroce strode into a cavernous operating room to check on a patient. On the table in front of him, a woman lay covered in curtains of blue surgical cloth, only her torso exposed. Earlier in the day, a surgical oncologist had removed her right breast as part of a mastectomy to treat her cancer. Later, another surgeon had taken flaps of fat from her stomach and interlaced them with blood vessels to create a new breast to replace the lost one. Now, in the fifth hour of surgery, a physician’s assistant leaned over her midsection, closing an incision along her side with some final stitches. Nurses hurried around the space, preparing to wrap up the operation. Paul Simon’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq-gYOrU8bA">You Can Call Me Al</a>” played in the background. The smell of burnt flesh hung in the air. A blue light signaled that the new arteries were successfully pumping blood. “Wow, that woman looks really good,” DellaCroce told the physician’s assistant. “Nice job.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0">There is no denying that the center’s high-end treatment means high costs. The median charge for an operation and hospital stay is about $165,000. DellaCroce and Sullivan hired consultants to review other well-regarded practices, who advised them their prices were competitive with their peers. “We weren’t asking to be paid Lebron James, best of the best, even though we feel we’re in the top 1 or 2% of the country,” Sullivan said. “We just wanted something fair.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.0">It is one of the quirks of the American health care system that insurers almost never pay the prices for procedures demanded by doctors and hospitals.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.0">To understand why requires a tour of the grand bargain at the heart of the health insurance system. Insurance companies negotiate with hospitals and doctors to discount reimbursements on medical procedures, like office visits or MRI scans. Providers who sign these contracts are in network. Insurance companies like in-network doctors because they can budget for health expenses and set premiums accordingly. Doctors and hospitals agree to be in network because they get a steady stream of insured patients.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="34.0">DellaCroce and Sullivan held contracts with insurers that resulted in average payments to the center’s doctors in the $20,000 to $30,000 range. But DellaCroce and Sullivan never came to an agreement with Blue Cross. That made them an exception in Louisiana — the insurer is so dominant that 97% of local physicians and hospitals are in network. DellaCroce and Sullivan said the company was not offering them enough money — in some cases not even enough to cover the cost of the surgeries, they argued in court documents. The doctors and their hospital remained out of network, meaning they charged Blue Cross the full price for their procedures.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.0">Such charges are controversial. Insurance companies and many health experts say they are too often inflated and untethered from actual costs. Physicians and hospitals say their fees are justified, reflecting the true price of medical care. In the end, insurers — especially in states like Louisiana, with few competitors — use their market power in negotiations to set reimbursements at what they want to pay, not what doctors charge.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.0">At Blue Cross, Dwight Brower was charged with reviewing the bills from the breast center. He had worked as a physician at a small family practice in Baton Rouge and then at a local hospital before joining Blue Cross as a medical director. He helped oversee prior authorizations. While many patients assume that an approval means an insurer will pay for an operation, it is simply a recognition that a procedure is medically necessary. Federal law mandates that private insurers cover breast restorations for women who undergo mastectomies because of cancer or genetic risk. And patients, in general, are allowed to choose their own doctors.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="38.0">However, since the center was out of network and had no contract with the insurer, Blue Cross determined how much it would pay for the treatment, and Brower believed that the breast center’s bills were exorbitant. “I did not think that they were reasonable,” <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537636-2024-09-13-st-charles-20240913-am/?mode=document#document/p47/a2630973">he would later testify</a>. Surgeons doing lung transplants or brain surgery rarely billed Blue Cross more than $50,000 for their work. Why should DellaCroce and Sullivan get so much more? “Don’t get me wrong. The surgeons at the center are extremely skilled,” he acknowledged. The operations were often lengthy. “But so are open-heart surgeries,” he said. “Relative to some of the other extremely complicated surgeries done by other surgeons in other areas of the body, it just seemed like their fee schedule was extremely high.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="39.0">Blue Cross Louisiana executives testified that they did not even consider doctors’ invoices when making decisions on what to reimburse because such charges were “unregulated” and “nonstandard.” Instead, they paid “<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25555648-2017-12-04-blue-cross-blue-shield-payment-for-out-of-network-providers/">an amount we establish</a>” — unless the doctor’s bill was cheaper. In the end, the insurer said it settled on reimbursing the breast center about the same as in-network doctors performing similar operations, even though DellaCroce and Sullivan did not benefit from having patients referred to them. In practice, that meant the insurer paid out a fraction of the breast center’s bills. Of the 7,837 medical procedures in dispute in the lawsuit, involving 1,680 patients, Blue Cross paid about $43 million on invoices totaling $500 million. Some 60% of the claims weren’t reimbursed at all. The difference between the bill and the payment could be striking. For example, in the case of Arch, Blue Cross paid $8,580 out of $102,722 for one operation. For another, it paid $3,190 out of $34,975.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="41.0">Executives said the Blue Cross reimbursements were fair, designed to keep premiums low for the nearly 2 million Louisianans who depended on the insurer to cover their health care.&nbsp;Paying the breast center’s full fees would add to its customers’ burden, they said. “If we were to just agree to any rates or any prices set by physicians or any providers, it would cause cost to be exorbitantly high for both the plan and for members particularly, because we wouldn’t be able to forecast or make sure those plans are actually sound,” <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537645-208c471/#document/p5/a2630982">said</a> Curtis Anders, the vice president of provider networks for Blue Cross. “Premiums would increase.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="42.0">For many out-of-network doctors, payments lower than their invoices are an infuriating part of doing business. They absorb the costs, or pass them on to their patients, a practice known as balance billing that can result in medical debt. DellaCroce and Sullivan were the rare physicians with the tenacity to fight. The center collected money from both insurers and patients — but it carried the unpaid portion of invoices on its books. That amount grew every year as it battled Blue Cross.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="43.0">DellaCroce and Sullivan were convinced that Blue Cross had singled them out for their obstreperousness, but they had no proof. Then, during a phone call one day, an employee for the center was talking to a Blue Cross representative to obtain a prior authorization. The representative let slip that the request required special handling. The breast center’s doctors were flagged on an internal roster. It was called the targeted list.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="45.0">On Dec. 8, 2023, several dozen attorneys and paralegals from Chehardy Sherman Williams, one of New Orleans’ top law firms, were celebrating their annual holiday party. They had gathered in a private dining room with gilded mirrors and shimmering chandeliers at Arnaud’s restaurant, a bastion of Creole cuisine in the heart of the French Quarter. The waiters served shrimp remoulade, prime rib and turtle soup. Small talk filled the air.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="46.0">Suddenly, several attorneys’ cellphones buzzed as they all received the same email, a message from the lawyers for Blue Cross. It contained discovery for the case, more than 42,000 pages of internal documents, emails and policies. Matthew Sherman, one of the attorneys representing the center, turned to a colleague. “Can you believe this?” he asked. It was like something from a John Grisham novel, the kind of thing he and his friends had joked about at law school, a document dump at Christmas time. By long tradition, many of New Orleans’ biggest law firms hold their holiday parties on the same Friday afternoon in December. Afterward, rival attorneys from around town gather for drinks under a flag of truce at a local bar. Sherman realized there would be no afterparty this year. Nor much of a holiday vacation.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.0">The delivery of the documents was a Christmas gift nearly 20 years in the making. DellaCroce and Sullivan’s <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25883705-2006-6487-crbs-v-bcbs-early-lawsuit/">first lawsuits</a> against Blue Cross, involving 88 breach-of-contract claims filed in a Louisiana civil court beginning in 2006, were dismissed because of a federal court ruling regarding jurisdiction. A <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25883734-2010-04-06-2010-03356-crbs-v-bcbsla-complaint/">second lawsuit</a>, which lasted from 2010 through 2017, resulted in limited discovery and a two-day trial in federal court. Jurors found that Blue Cross had failed to tell the center how much it would pay for procedures, but they also ruled the center had not been financially harmed. A judge dismissed the remaining claims.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="48.0">DellaCroce and Sullivan launched their <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537857-2019-10-10-3rd-amended-complaint/">third lawsuit</a> in February 2017 with a novel legal theory: They accused Blue Cross of fraud. They contended that for years the insurer had issued prior authorizations without the intention of paying the actual bills. Their lawyers had sought the targeted list during discovery to help prove the case. Blue Cross denied it existed.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="49.0">But now, as Sherman and fellow attorney Patrick Follette began poring over the thousands of documents, they came upon a spreadsheet that said “<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537631-2024-09-06-am-st-charles-surgical-20240906-am/?mode=document#document/p56/a2624531">Targeted Provider List</a>.” The first names on the list were DellaCroce and Sullivan. It was labeled “confidential” and dated June 2007 — about a year after the pair had filed their first lawsuit against Blue Cross alleging nonpayment. More digging turned up other documents. There was a “blocked” list that also featured the two doctors.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="51.0">A corporate policy document provided what DellaCroce and Sullivan considered the most revealing explanation for Blue Cross’ financial motivation. Blue Cross insurers are independent companies that operate under a common set of rules, similar to franchisees in a fast-food chain. When a person covered by Blue Cross in their home state receives treatment in another state, the Blue Cross where the treatment occurs pays the provider and then recoups the cost from the home-state plan. What the attorneys discovered was that Blue Cross Louisiana would receive a share of any savings it could generate for the home-state plan. Say, for instance, Blue Cross Alabama was facing a bill of $5,000 for a procedure. If Blue Cross Louisiana instead paid $1,000, it saved the Alabama plan $4,000. The policy allowed Blue Cross Louisiana <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537637-20736f1/?mode=document#document/p36/a2631133">to earn 16% of the savings</a> — in this scenario, $640.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="52.0">For DellaCroce and Sullivan, the revelations cemented their belief that Blue Cross was a bad corporate actor more interested in power and control than health care. The percentage fee incentivized the insurer to pay the doctors as little as possible. The bigger the savings, the more Blue Cross made. “It’s win-win,” DellaCroce said. “That’s their pay day.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="53.0">As the trial approached, Blue Cross attempted to settle the case. DellaCroce and Sullivan refused the offer as too low.</p>

    The Trial
</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="56.0">On the afternoon of Sept. 5, 2024, the case — St. Charles Surgical Hospital, L.L.C. and Center for Restorative Breast Surgery, L.L.C. v. Louisiana Health Service &amp; Indemnity Company D/B/A Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Louisiana, Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Louisiana, Inc. and HMO Louisiana, Inc. — opened in Division C of the Orleans Parish Civil District Court, a high-ceilinged room with dark brown benches and tables, fake marble columns and fluorescent lights. James Williams, the chief litigator for the hospital, had already impressed the 45 potential jurors by memorizing all their names and backgrounds during jury selection. Now, he stood up and placed a football on the plaintiff’s table in front of the 12 chosen to try the case, which included a third grade teacher, a movie stunt double and a hotel manager. He warned them that they would hear a lot of “insurance talk” from Blue Cross. “I’m going to ask you, ladies and gentlemen on the jury, keep your eye on the ball. Keep your eye on what this case is about,” Williams told them. “If they start saying things like, ‘Well, oh, we paid them what we thought was fair, 9%,’ keep your eye on the ball, right?”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="57.0">Over 10 days — interrupted by a two-day break to allow a hurricane to pass across Louisiana — Williams made his case that Blue Cross had defrauded his clients by making promises to pay but failing to deliver.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="58.0">Much of Blue Cross’ defense had relied on the notice that a prior authorization was no guarantee of payment. The insurer had not committed fraud, it said, since it never explicitly promised the center to reimburse anything. Udvarhelyi, the former CEO, had insisted on that. But on the stand, Blue Cross witnesses provided a more nuanced explanation. They acknowledged that the disclaimer was not meant as a general excuse to free the company from paying bills. A prior authorization “usually” resulted in a payment, testified Brower, who reviewed the center’s bills. He said that the notice was intended for specific situations. For instance, Blue Cross would not cover a woman who dropped out of her insurance before the operation. Nor would it pay anything if a patient had not met her deductible. But otherwise, Brower said, Blue Cross intended to compensate for a procedure that it had authorized. “It’s inappropriate for us as a company to approve a code and then turn around and deny it,” <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537637-20736f1/?mode=document#document/p13/a2624462">Brower said</a>.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.0">Over the years, the center had appealed thousands of reimbursements for being too low. It hired additional employees to manage the paperwork. At the trial, Blue Cross revealed that it had never considered any of the appeals — nor had it ever told the center that they were pointless. “An appeal is not available to review an underpayment,” <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537645-208c471/#document/p37/a2630979">acknowledged</a> Paula Shepherd, a Blue Cross executive vice president. The insurer simply issued an edict — the payment was correct.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="61.0">This was the core of the case. The insurer set the rules. The insurer set the prices. Doctors could appeal to a state insurance regulator. But if that failed, and it often did, the only recourse was a long, costly lawsuit.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="62.0">Williams <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537630-2024-02/?mode=document#document/p27/a2631151">summed up</a> for the jury the center’s treatment at the hands of Blue Cross: “Our payments are slow pay, low pay or no pay.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="63.0">In countering those arguments, Blue Cross witnesses explained that the insurer was committed to paying for Louisianans’ health care and keeping costs low. As a nonprofit, it directed any excess revenue from operations back into the business. (Udvarhelyi, the CEO, did acknowledge that his salary, over $1 million, included bonuses that depended on hitting revenue targets and increasing membership.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="64.0">Brian West, a Blue Cross executive who monitored payments, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537635-2024-09-10-st-charles-20240910/?mode=document#document/p14/a2631153">said the center</a> had engaged in “egregious” billing practices. “They are bad actors in the billing world,” he said. But company witnesses offered only a handful of examples. Sometimes the center mistakenly coded its bills in a way that appeared to charge for four separate breast reconstructions in a single operation. In other cases, the center asked for payment for two surgeons in the room at the same time. But Blue Cross, following Medicare guidelines, would pay two surgeons only 20% more than the reimbursement for a single surgeon.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="66.0">Blue Cross did not accuse the center of any intentional miscoding — but the sloppy billing led to additional scrutiny, the company’s witnesses said. The targeted list, a witness testified, had been created especially for the center, requiring all prior authorization requests to bypass normal routes for a special review by company doctors. The blocked list meant that each bill from the center received a manual scrub by payment specialists before reimbursement. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537635-2024-09-10-st-charles-20240910/#document/p17/a2631155">Blue Cross acknowledged</a> the careful checking often resulted in the need for more information from the center, which could result in slower processing of claims. But the lists, executives insisted, were not designed to reduce payments. “Basically, no harm was done,” <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537634-2058691/#document/p55/a2631154">said</a> Becky Juncker, who was involved in approving surgical procedures.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="68.0">Company witnesses explained that the 16% received in saving money for out-of-state Blue Cross insurers was a fee to cover the costs of handling adjustments of the claim — though they were not able to explain why Blue Cross did not charge a flat fee for its services.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="69.0">Blue Cross also defended itself against the accusation that it had paid nothing for 60% of the charges for individual procedures. Witnesses said the insurer had followed industry practice in bundling charges to make a single payment for an operation. An attorney for the center noted that it had never agreed to take bundled payments — Blue Cross had imposed them.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="70.0">As to the calls to women like Arch? That was an effort to save members money. “Our medical area would reach out to our members who were utilizing out-of-network providers to help them understand the, I would say, the financial implications,” said Shepherd, the Blue Cross executive vice president, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25892223-2023-12-11-paula-shepherd-depo/?mode=document#document/p1/a2631176">in a deposition</a>. “It could be financially catastrophic to a member to have an out-of-network claim that they are financially responsible for. It’s a huge difference.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="71.0">In summing up the case, Kim Boyle, the lead attorney for the company, told jurors that Blue Cross had not committed fraud. It had acted to ensure the company and its members paid a fair price for the center’s services, she said. “There’s no scheme. There’s no plot. There’s no mafia. There are no Blue Cross employees of Louisiana that are sitting in some smoke-filled room in Baton Rouge, plotting against these plaintiffs on St. Charles Avenue in New Orleans,” Boyle said. “It’s fiction; it’s fancy; it’s completely made up.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="72.0">On Sept. 20, at 1:57 p.m., Judge Sidney H. Cates IV sent the jurors to deliberate. The center attorneys retreated to a nearby hotel to await the verdict. About two hours later, they were summoned back to Division C. Williams put his head down and swore. He worried that such a quick return in the legally complex case meant victory for Blue Cross.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="73.0">The center’s lawyers paid close attention to Cates as he reviewed the jurors’ decision. It was a two-page form. If the jurors found in favor of Blue Cross, the judge would have no reason to read on. Cates flipped to the second page: The jurors had found Blue Cross liable for fraud. “Please express in dollars the total monetary compensation, if any, Blue Cross owes the hospital and the center for the damages,” Cates said, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25892343-2024-09-27-jury-form-with-verdict/?mode=document">reading from the verdict</a>. “Net damages, $421,488,633.” The center’s lawyers stood and shook hands as the insurer’s attorneys prepared to leave the courtroom.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="74.0">DellaCroce was in surgery at the hospital, having expected a longer deliberation. Sullivan was in the courtroom to hear the verdict. Afterward, jurors approached and thanked him for his work. He teared up. “We would have given more if we had been asked for more. That’s how egregious the fraud was,” Juliet Laughlin, a 58-year-old property manager who served as forewoman, later said. “There had been wrong done.”</p>
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="76.0">Blue Cross has appealed the verdict. A health insurance trade group has warned that the finding sets a dangerous precedent. If allowed to stand, insurance companies in Louisiana may find themselves forced to pay whatever price is demanded by out-of-network doctors — which in turn could raise health insurance premiums across the state, the Louisiana Association of Health Plans said in a statement.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="77.0">For DellaCroce and Sullivan, the verdict was vindication. They had refused to sign contracts they thought unfair. They had rejected settlement offers they thought too low. The trial had revealed Blue Cross’ domineering behavior. “Fundamentally, I think their problem was that we were doctors who had control,” DellaCroce said. “That was regarded as a threat.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="78.0">In the months since the judgment, Blue Cross has not changed its practices, the doctors said. It has not approached with an offer that would bring the hospital in network. It still issues prior authorizations for women’s surgeries. And it still pays only a fraction of the billed fees.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>The rise of AI-powered code generation tools is reshaping how developers write software - and introducing new risks to the software supply chain in the process.</p>
<p>AI coding assistants, like large language models in general, have a habit of hallucinating. They suggest code that incorporates software packages that don't exist.</p>
<p>As we noted <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/28/ai_bots_hallucinate_software_packages/">in March</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/30/ai_code_helpers_invent_packages/">September</a> last year, security and academic researchers have found that AI code assistants invent package names. In a recent study, researchers found that about 5.2 percent of package suggestions from commercial models didn't exist, compared to 21.7 percent from open source models.</p>

    

<p>Running that code should result in an error when importing a non-existent package. But miscreants have realized that they can hijack the hallucination for their own benefit.</p>

        


        

<p>All that's required is to create a malicious software package under a hallucinated package name and then upload the bad package to a package registry or index like PyPI or npm for distribution. Thereafter, when an AI code assistant re-hallucinates the co-opted name, the process of installing dependencies and executing the code will run the malware.</p>
<p>The recurrence appears to follow a bimodal pattern - some hallucinated names show up repeatedly when prompts are re-run, while others vanish entirely - suggesting certain prompts reliably produce the same phantom packages.</p>

        

<p>As <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://socket.dev/blog/slopsquatting-how-ai-hallucinations-are-fueling-a-new-class-of-supply-chain-attacks">noted</a> by security firm Socket recently, the academic researchers who explored the subject last year found that re-running the same hallucination-triggering prompt ten times resulted in 43 percent of hallucinated packages being repeated every time and 39 percent never reappearing.</p>
<p>Exploiting hallucinated package names represents a form of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/630.html">typosquatting</a>, where variations or misspellings of common terms are used to dupe people. Seth Michael Larson, security developer-in-residence at the Python Software Foundation, has dubbed it "slopsquatting" – "slop" being a common pejorative for AI model output.</p>
<p>"We're in the very early days looking at this problem from an ecosystem level," Larson told <em>The Register</em>. "It's difficult, and likely impossible, to quantify how many attempted installs are happening because of LLM hallucinations without more transparency from LLM providers. Users of LLM generated code, packages, and information should be double-checking LLM outputs against reality before putting any of that information into operation, otherwise there can be real-world consequences."</p>

        

<p>Larson said that there are many reasons a developer might attempt to install a package that doesn't exist, including mistyping the package name, incorrectly installing internal packages without checking to see whether those names already exist in a public index (dependency confusion), differences in the package name and the module name, and so on.</p>
<p>"We’re seeing a real shift in how developers write code," Feross Aboukhadijeh, CEO of security firm Socket, told <em>The Register</em>. "With AI tools becoming the default assistant for many, '<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383">vibe coding</a>' is happening constantly. Developers prompt the AI, copy the suggestion, and move on. Or worse, the AI agent just goes ahead and installs the recommended packages itself.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The problem is, these code suggestions often include hallucinated package names that sound real but don't exist</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"The problem is, these code suggestions often include hallucinated package names that sound real but don’t exist. I’ve seen this firsthand. You paste it into your terminal and the install fails – or worse, it doesn’t fail, because someone has slop-squatted that exact package name."</p>
<p>Aboukhadijeh said these fake packages can look very convincing.</p>
<p>"When we investigate, we sometimes find realistic looking READMEs, fake GitHub repos, even sketchy blogs that make the package seem authentic," he said, adding that Socket's security scans will catch these packages because they analyze the way the code works.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>What a world we live in: AI hallucinated packages are validated and rubber-stamped by another AI that is too eager to be helpful</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Even worse, when you Google one of these slop-squatted package names, you’ll often get an AI-generated summary from Google itself confidently praising the package, saying it’s useful, stable, well-maintained. But it’s just parroting the package’s own README, no skepticism, no context. To a developer in a rush, it gives a false sense of legitimacy.</p>
<p>"What a world we live in: AI hallucinated packages are validated and rubber-stamped by another AI that is too eager to be helpful."</p>
<p>Aboukhadijeh pointed to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://socket.dev/blog/gmail-for-exfiltration-malicious-npm-packages-target-solana-private-keys-and-drain-victim-s">an incident in January</a> in which Google's AI Overview, which responds to search queries with AI-generated text, suggested a malicious npm package @async-mutex/mutex, which was typosquatting the legitimate package async-mutex.</p>
<p>He also noted that recently a threat actor using the name "_Iain" published a playbook on a dark web forum detailing how to build a blockchain-based botnet using malicious npm packages.</p>
<p>Aboukhadijeh explained that _Iain "automated the creation of thousands of typo-squatted packages (many targeting crypto libraries) and even used ChatGPT to generate realistic-sounding variants of real package names at scale. He shared video tutorials walking others through the process, from publishing the packages to executing payloads on infected machines via a GUI. It’s a clear example of how attackers are weaponizing AI to accelerate software supply chain attacks."</p>

</ul>
<p>Larson said the Python Software Foundation is working constantly to make package abuse more difficult, adding such work takes time and resources.</p>
<p>"Alpha-Omega has sponsored the work of Mike Fiedler, our PyPI Safety &amp; Security Engineer, to work on reducing the risks of malware on PyPI such as by implementing an programmatic API to report malware, partnering with existing malware reporting teams, and implementing better detections for typo-squatting of top projects," he said.</p>
<p>"Users of PyPI and package managers in general should be checking that the package they are installing is an existing well-known package, that there are no typos in the name, and that the content of the package has been reviewed before installation. Even better, organizations can mirror a subset of PyPI within their own organizations to have much more control over which packages are available for developers." ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <p>On April 9, 2025, someone risked about $2.5 million—and walked away with more than $70 million in under an hour.</p><p>The trade was simple, but bold: buy a specific kind of option tied to SPY, the exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the S&amp;P 500, the most widely followed index of large-cap U.S. companies. The option—known as a call—gave the buyer the right to purchase SPY at $509 per share. That might not sound strange, except that SPY was trading below $500 when they placed the bet. And the option was set to expire the same day.</p><p>These are known as zero-day expiry options. They’re cheap because they’re risky. If the market doesn’t move in your favor, they expire worthless. If the market does move, they can pay off massively. But you have to be exactly right on both direction and timing.</p><p>In this case, the timing was perfect. The trade was placed just before 1:01 pm Eastern Time. At 1:30 pm, Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that he was pausing most of the tariffs he had imposed earlier that month. The market exploded upward. SPY surged well past the 509 mark. Those options that had cost just 85 cents were suddenly worth more than $25.</p><figure><img src="https://data-and-politics.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-20.55.36.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="934" height="924" srcset="https://data-and-politics.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-20.55.36.png 600w, https://data-and-politics.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-20.55.36.png 934w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Notice the spike in trade at 17:00 GMT.</span></figcaption></figure><p>This was not a small-volume trade. About 30,000 contracts changed hands. That’s a $2.5 million position that turned into more than $70 million. And that’s just one strike. Similar trades occurred in SPY 504, 505, 507, and QQQ contracts as well, suggesting that the total take may have been far larger.</p><p>It wasn’t just the profit. It was the precision. The market moved before the news. The options were bought before the rally. The volume spiked in contracts that almost never see this kind of interest unless something is expected. And the pattern wasn’t visible on previous trading days. This wasn’t a trend. It was a singular event.</p><p>And it wasn’t just options. At exactly 1:01 pm EST, trading volume in SPY shares themselves spiked. Nearly 2.75 million shares were bought in that single minute. If those shares were sold at the closing price of $533.94, the buyers would have locked in a gain of more than $36 per share—earning over $100 million in profit in sixty seconds.</p><p>Over the next fifteen minutes, volume remained elevated. If the same rate of trading continued, that window alone could account for more than 41 million shares traded. That means more than $1.5 billion in potential profit—all before the public even knew why the market was moving.</p><p>If the trades hadn’t worked out, the losses would have been swift and total. Zero-day options don’t forgive bad timing. The entire $2.5 million could have evaporated by the close of trading. Even with SPY shares, any unexpected reversal would have meant millions in losses. That’s what makes this kind of trading so revealing. Institutions hedge. Retail investors chase momentum. But this? This was conviction. Or it was information.</p><p>I checked comparable moments in market history: emergency rate cuts in 2008, the first quantitative easing program in 2009. These were true market shocks. But in those cases, SPY volume was flat before the announcements. The price didn’t move until after the news hit the wire. No sign of early bets. No one placing $2 million chips on the right number just minutes before the roulette wheel stopped.</p><figure><img src="https://data-and-politics.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-09-at-21.15.58.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1528" height="938" srcset="https://data-and-politics.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-09-at-21.15.58.png 600w, https://data-and-politics.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-09-at-21.15.58.png 1000w, https://data-and-politics.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-09-at-21.15.58.png 1528w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure><img src="https://data-and-politics.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-09-at-21.16.07.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1524" height="936" srcset="https://data-and-politics.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-09-at-21.16.07.png 600w, https://data-and-politics.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-09-at-21.16.07.png 1000w, https://data-and-politics.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-09-at-21.16.07.png 1524w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>This time was different. April 9 shows all the hallmarks of pre-positioning—where a trader takes a major position just before a known catalyst. Sometimes it’s just a hunch. Sometimes it’s a coincidence. And sometimes it’s something else entirely.</p><p>We don’t know who placed the trades. We don’t know what they knew. But we do know this: if they were guessing, they guessed better than almost anyone in modern market history. And if they weren’t guessing, then someone made a fortune off of information the public didn’t yet have.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://fractalfir.github.io/generated_html/cg_clr_odd_platforms.html">https://fractalfir.github.io/generated_html/cg_clr_odd_platforms.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43661329">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This is an update on the progress I have made on my Rust to C compiler. I am experimenting a bit with a new article format: instead of an overarching theme, this is more of a collection of smaller bits and pieces, sewn together.</p>

<h2 id="the_big_news">The big news</h2>

<p>I will first start with the biggest news: I am going to be giving <a href="https://rustweek.org/talks/michal/">a talk about the project</a> during Rust Week(in Utrecht, Netherlands).</p>

<p>Creating this talk has been an interesting challenge: I tried to strike a good balance between being approachable for beginners, while still talking about a pretty advanced topic.</p>

<p>So, if you are attending Rust Week, and are interested in what I have to say, you can come and hear it in person! If you see me during the conference, and want to talk, don’t be shy to say hi.</p>

<p>Now that this is out of the way...</p>

<h2 id="passing_more_tests">Passing more tests</h2>

<p>I have also been slowly working on fixing as many tests as possible, and I can already boast a 95.9 % core test pass rate. This is a nice bump from the 92% pass rate two months ago.</p>

<p>There still are about 65 tests that need fixing, but they all seem to have pretty similar causes. So, fixing them should not be too difficult.</p>

<p>The .NET side of the project has also heavily benefited from the fixes I implemented: now, 96.3 % of Rust core tests run in .NET.</p>

<h2 id="bugfixes">Bugfixes</h2>

<h2 id="128_bit_ints">128 bit ints</h2>

<p>Most of the current improvements come from fixes to 128 bit intrinsics, checked arithmetics, and subslicing.</p>

<p>The C popcount intrinsic has 3 variants: <code>__builtin_popcount</code>(int), <code>__builtin_popcountl</code>(long) and <code>__builtin_popcountll</code>(<strong>long long</strong>).<br></p>

<p>It might seem logical to assume that the C intrinsic <code>__builtin_popcountll</code> works on 128 bit ints - it does not.</p>

<p>It works on the <code>long long</code> type, which is not the same as <code>__int128_t</code>. At least on Linux, <code>long</code> and <code>long long</code> are both 64 bits in size. This is something I knew about, but I did not consider that 2 differently named intrinsics would end up just being one and the same thing.</p>

<pre><code>int pop_count64(long num) {
   return __builtin_popcountl(num);
}
int pop_count128(__int128_t num) {
   return __builtin_popcountll(num);
}</code></pre>

<pre><code>pop_count64:
       xor     eax, eax
       popcnt  rax, rdi
       ret
pop_count128:
       xor     eax, eax
       popcnt  rax, rdi
       ret</code></pre>

<p>It turns out that my implementation of most of the bit counting intrinsics(count leading / trailing zeroes) have been silently truncating 128 bit ints to 64 bit ones, and only them performing the needed calculations. That obviously yields incorrect results.</p>

<p>However, emulating those 128 bit intrinsics is not too difficult. The <code>popcount</code> intrinsic simply checks how many bits are set in an integer. So, I can add up the number of bits set in the lower and higher half of that integer, and get the correct result .</p>

<pre><code>static inline __uint128_t pop_count128(__uint128_t val) {
   return __builtin_popcountl((uint64_t)val) +  __builtin_popcountl((uint64_t)(val&gt;&gt;64));
}</code></pre>

<p>I have also finally fully implemented the very last checked arithmetic operations. Checking for overflows during 128 bit int multiplication is hard. For quite some time. I have been trying to come up with some clever ideas for fast overflow checks. Sadly none of them ended up working out for 128 bit multiplication.</p>

<p>After much deliberation, I decided to simply settle for the easy, but inefficient check. Basically, as long as <code>(a * b) / b == a</code>, and b is not zero, overflow did not occur.</p>

<pre><code>bool u128_mul_ovf_check(__uint128_t A0 ,__uint128_t A1 ){
bb0:
	if((A1) != (0)) goto bb1;
	return false;
bb1:
	return (((A0) * (A1)) / (A1)) == (A1);
}</code></pre>

<p>This is nothing groundbreaking, but they - at least it works, and it gets a few more tests to pass.</p>

<h2 id="subslicing">Subslicing</h2>

<p>The subslicing bug was quite embarrassing: I forgot a sizeof, and was offsetting the slice’s data pointer by bytes instead of elements. It is not hard to see why this is wrong.</p>

<p>With how simple this bug is, you might wonder how on earth it has managed to stay undetected for so long. Well, the code was only broken for subslicing from the end of the slice, and not its beginning. To my knowledge, that sub slicing mode is mainly used in pattern matching.</p>

<pre><code>let ok = slice[2..5];
let still_ok = slice[5..];
// broken
if let [start, reminder] = slice{
	panic!();
};</code></pre>

<p>So, subslicing was only broken for this specific pattern, and always worked fine for byte/string slices(bytes and UTF8 code <em>units</em> are a 1 byte in size). This allowed it to sneak past my own tests, and only showed up when running the whole Rust compiler test suite.</p>

<h2 id="fallback_intrinsics">Fallback intrinsics</h2>

<p>It turns out I did not have to implement <em>some</em> intrinsics manually - the Rust compiler already supports emulating them. For certain intrinsics, this is a god send - since they are a pain to implement by hand.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/intrinsics/fn.carrying_mul_add.html">carrying_mul_add</a> requires you to perform multiplication on an integer 2x larger than the input one. This is fine up to 64 bits, but… what integer is larger than 128 bits? LLVM supports 256 bit ints, but C(and .NET) does not. </p>

<pre><code>define void @carrying_mul_add(ptr dead_on_unwind noalias nocapture noundef writable writeonly sret([32 x i8]) align 16 dereferenceable(32) initializes((0, 32)) %_0, i128 noundef %a, i128 noundef %b, i128 noundef %c, i128 noundef %d) unnamed_addr #0 !dbg !7 {
  %0 = zext i128 %a to i256, !dbg !25
  %1 = zext i128 %b to i256, !dbg !25
  %2 = zext i128 %c to i256, !dbg !25
  %3 = zext i128 %d to i256, !dbg !25
  %4 = mul nuw i256 %1, %0, !dbg !25
  %5 = add nuw i256 %4, %2, !dbg !25
  %6 = add nuw i256 %5, %3, !dbg !25
  %7 = trunc i256 %6 to i128, !dbg !25
  %8 = lshr i256 %6, 128, !dbg !25
  %9 = trunc nuw i256 %8 to i128, !dbg !25
  store i128 %7, ptr %_0, align 16, !dbg !25
  %10 = getelementptr inbounds nuw i8, ptr %_0, i64 16, !dbg !25
  store i128 %9, ptr %10, align 16, !dbg !25
  ret void, !dbg !26
}</code></pre>

<p>So, the ability to <em>just</em> use a built-in emulated version of this intrinsic is amazing: this means I don’t need to fiddle around and find my own solution to this problem.</p>

<p>This is also very interesting for another reason: since <code>carrying_mul_add</code> performs 256 bit multiplication and addition using 128 bit integers, it means it is capable of performing 128 bit operations using 64 bit ints.</p>

<p>I am currently looking into understanding that fallback implementation a little bit better, in order to base my own emulation of 128 bit ints on that.</p>

<p>While a lot of modern C compilers and platforms support 128 bit ints without a major hassle, I want to support as many platforms as possible.</p>

<h2 id="supporting_more_c_compilers.">Supporting more C compilers.</h2>

<p>Besides that, I have been working on improving C compiler compatibility. You might have seen Rust code <a href="">running on a Game boy</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ji6cmk/media_a_rust_program_compiled_to_only_move/">compiled to movs</a>, or the April Fool's special of Rust running on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1jp9227/media_rust_compiled_to_holly_c_running_on_templeos/">Temple OS</a>.</p>

<p>The more obscure C compilers I support(to any degree) the higher the chance Rust code will run with proprietary C compilers I have no direct access to.</p>

<p>This has been a bigger problem for the project as of late. Turns out, a lot of platforms are not supported for a good reason(lack of docs + lack of access). Not supporting those platforms is a bit of a hindrance for the project.</p>

<p>To give an example: there have been discussions about writing <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/998115/">some new parts of Git in Rust</a>.</p>

<p>Sadly, doing that would mean degrading / dropping Git support for the proprietary platform NonStop - since it does not support Rust(or LLVM or even GCC), at all.</p>

<p>Originally, I was a bit optimistic about situations like this: if my project compiled Rust to C, it could eliminate this problem altogether.</p>

<p>In <em>theory</em> Rust would be able to run anywhere C can. There are some big asterisks to this(I am still unsure if I can work around certain issues on <em>all platforms</em>), but hey - this might be the best shot at supporting Rust there, save for companies stepping in and adding LLVM support, which I feel is… unlikely.</p>

<p>Recently, I wanted to check if "Supporting Rust by compling it to C" is a viable strategy in a case like this.</p>

<p>However, I immediately hit a stone wall. I could find no legal way of obtaining a compiler for this platform without buying a server, which is definitely <strong>way, way outside my budget</strong>.</p>

<p>So, I don't belive Rust is going to run on a platform like this any time soon.</p>

<h2 id="plan_for_now">Plan for now</h2>

<p>For now, the plan is to get as close to standard-compliant C99(or maybe even ANSI C) as possible, and only use standard POSIX APIs(I need some threading support to properly initialise thread-locals).<br></p>

<p>That means I have my own fallbacks for certain intrinsics, and I am slowly but surely working on expanding that list. I have had some success running <em>very, very simple</em> Rust programs on ANSI C compilers, so there is definitely some hope.</p>

<p>Fingers crossed, that’ll mean that adding support for currently unviable platforms is easy enough when a need for that arises.</p>

<h2 id="tiny_perf_improvements">Tiny perf improvements</h2>

<p>I have also worked on a wide variety of performance improvements. The smallest changes were related to integer literals. I realized that, for integers smaller than 2^32, their hex form is always bigger if not as big as their decimal form, due to the <code>0x</code> prefix. Eg. 255 is a byte shorter than 0xFF, and so is 65536(0xFFFF). Only for 2^32 things start to even out. This may seem like a negligible change. However, I generate <em>a lot</em> of C code. In some more extreme cases(transpling the entire Rust compiler to C), I have generated up to 1GB of C source files. At that point, shaving even a fraction of a percent of the total file size has an impact.</p>

<p>My way of embedding debug info(using the <code>#line</code> directive) also got a bit smarter - the source file name will not repeat, and is only included when that changes.</p>

<p>So this:</p>

<pre><code>#line 1 great.rs
L0 = A0 + A0;
#line 2 great.rs
L1 = L0 * 5.5;
#line 1 amazing.rs
L2 = L1 * L1 * L1;
#line 4 great.rs
L3 = L2 - A0</code></pre>

<p>Is written like this, instead:</p>

<pre><code>#line 1 great.rs
L0 = A0 + A0;
#line 2 
L1 = L0 * 5.5;
#line 1 amazing.rs
L2 = L1 * L1 * L1;
#line 4 great.rs
L3 = L2 - A0</code></pre>

<p>It may seem like a tiny change, but it reduces file sizes by a lot(when using debug info).</p>

<h2 id="refactors">Refactors</h2>

<p><code>rustc_codegen_clr</code> has seen some big, internal refactors. I have managed to split some parts of it into separate crates, which speeds up incremental builds. That makes development a bit easier.</p>

<p>I am also progressing along with my move to a more memory-efficient interned IR. Along the way, I am also slowly removing some jank from the old IR.</p>

<p>The main issue is that there exist some rather exotic r/lvalues which don’t map too well to C. They are quite hard to show without going into some more obscure features of Rust, like dynamically sized types. You can safely skip this section.</p>

<p>Consider this piece of Rust code:</p>

<pre><code>/// Custom DST.
struct MyStr{
	sized:u8,
	s:str
}
impl MyStr{
	fn inner_str(&amp;self)-&gt;&amp;str{
    		&amp;self.s
	}
}</code></pre>

<p>This line <code>&amp;self.s</code> may seem <em>simple</em> but it is not. Since <code>MyStr</code> is a dynamically sized type, so the pointer to it is “fat” - it contains metadata.</p>

<p>Let us think about what kind of C code this function will produce.</p>

<pre><code>FatPtr_str inner_str(FatPtr_MyStr self){
	// What goes here?
}</code></pre>

<p>Here, we need to do 2 things: Offset the “data” pointer of our <code>self</code> fat pointer by <code>1</code>(the size of the fixed-size fields) Create a new slice from that data pointer, and some metadata. This is quite easy to do in modern C.</p>

<pre><code>struct FatPtr_str inner_str(struct FatPtr_MyStr self){
   return (struct FatPtr_str){self.data + 1, self.meta};
}</code></pre>

<p>However, compound literals were not part of the language until C99, and a lot of old/obscure compilers don’t support that.</p>

<p>Instead, we need to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>struct FatPtr_str inner_str(struct FatPtr_MyStr self){
   struct FatPtr_str tmp;
   tmp.data = self.data;
   tmp.meta =  self.meta;
   return tmp;
}</code></pre>

<p>This is an ANSI-C compliant way of doing things. <strong>However</strong> you might notice that 1 line of Rust(and MIR) now corresponds to multiple lines of C. That is a pain to manage on the IR level. The old IR had an odd way of dealing with this: it essentially allowed you to create an inner scope, with a temporary local, and some “sub-statements”.</p>

<p>This is quite messy, and frankly an idiotic way of dealing with this problem. Well, at least I now know that I will not be making this exact mistake again. The new way of doing things is a bit more complex in the setup phase, but it makes the whole IR much more simple.</p>

<p>There are other cases where this “temporary scope” was useful, but now, only 1 of the most annoying cases like this remains. Once I get that solved, I’ll be able to entirely get rid of this abomination of a feature.</p>

<p>This will allow me to fully move to the new IR, which is going to be very neat.<br></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I have made a fair bit of progress during the last few months. There definitely are some diminishing results to bug fixing: the less bugs there are, the more time I need to track them all down. Still, there is something new to learn about both C and Rust every day. I have been working on <a href="https://github.com/FractalFir/rustc_codegen_clr">`rustc_codegen_clr`</a> for 1.5 years now - that feels a bit... odd. A lot has happened in that time: both in my personal life, and in the wider world.</p>

<p>Truth be told, that sometimes feels like it was a lifetime ago.</p>

<p>In this strange, new world, there is a bit of comfort in the monotony of work - each day, I inch towards a grander goal. I learned a lot along the way, but with each passing moment, I see there is so much more to know. It is calming.</p>

<p>But I digress - you have come here to hear about Rust, and compilers.</p>

<p>I have some interesting things coming: I am working on finishing the part 2 of "Rust panics under the hood" - a step by step explanation of the Rust panicking process. I am considering splitting that article in two: It is already 10 minutes long, and I have only just finished explaining how panic messages are created.</p>

<p>Besides that, I have been working on a few odd things, including a tiny(2K LOC), but very accurate memory profiler for Rust. My schedule is quite tight, but I hope I will write something about this in the coming weeks.</p>

My love and interest for AI grew parallel to DeepMind’s successes. I was rooting, almost like a sports fan, for them.</span></p><p><span>So, for years, I’ve been low-key saddened by their constant </span><em>fumbling</em><span>. They had the tech, the talent, the money, the infrastructure, the prestige, and the conviction to make ChatGPT—or whatever else they wanted—before OpenAI. They didn't. CEO Sundar Pichai was afraid to thwart Google’s main revenue source (search and ads). He chose prudence over boldness. Good—they didn’t shoot themselves in the foot.</span></p><p><span>Because they didn’t shoot </span><em>at all.</em></p><p>But that was the last mistake they made. Today, two and a half years after the ChatGPT debacle, Google DeepMind is winning. They are winning so hard right now that they’re screaming, “Please, please, we can’t take it anymore, it’s too much winning!” No, but really—I wonder if the only reason OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, and Co. ever had the slightest chance to win is because Google fumbled that one time. They don’t anymore.</p><p><span>I’d been holding off on writing about Gemini 2.5. Focusing on the AI model didn’t feel like enough to tell the full story of Google’s comeback. Gemini 2.5 is only a piece—albeit a big one—of something much larger.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>  <h2 id="whats-a-websocket">What’s a WebSocket?</h2>
<p>If you’re new to web development or you haven’t heard of a WebSocket before, they’re a way to open a two-way communication channel between the client and server using HTTP as the transport protocol. In less nerdy terms, it’s a way to keep an open line of communication between the client and server so that both can send and receive messages at any time. (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API">MDN Reference</a>)</p>
<p>Because of how it’s advertised on the tin, it’s natural to think of a WebSocket as the best (and sometimes only) way to orchestrate a long-living stream of data between client and server, like for instance a real time application. In practice though, it turns out there are a few reasons why you might not want to use them:</p>
<h3 id="websocket-messages-arent-transactional">WebSocket messages aren’t transactional</h3>
<p>I see a lot of instances where WebSockets are used as the way of maintaining consistency for some kind of state object. For instance, you use the transmitting side of the socket to represent mutations to some object, and the receiving side of the socket to represent state as it gets changed by those mutations. That way if you have multiple clients listening to the same object, they’ll all see the same state changes without having to refresh the page.</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span><span># Client 1</span></span>
<span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; { command: "increment", amount: 5 }</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;&lt;&lt; { event: "count", value: 5 }</span></span>
<span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; { command: "decrement", amount: 2 }</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;&lt;&lt; { event: "count", value: 3 }</span></span>
<span><span># Client 2</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;&lt;&lt; { event: "count", value: 5 }</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;&lt;&lt; { event: "count", value: 3 }</span></span></code></pre>
<p>But what if you placed some kind of invariant condition on the state object? For instance, you want to make sure that the count is never negative:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span><span>&lt;&lt;&lt; { event: "count", amount: 5 }</span></span>
<span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; { command: "decrement", amount: 6 }</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;&lt;&lt; { error: "count cannot be negative" }</span></span></code></pre>
<p>The issue here is that there’s no association between the mutation and error message since the error message will be received on the same stream as every other message. We can’t reliably say “the next message” received on the stream is the result of the previous command since the server could have sent any number of messages in between now and then.</p>
<p>If we wanted to update the UI to show the error, we’d have to link the error event somehow (like providing an associative request id in the command and the error message):</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; { command: "decrement", amount: 6, requestId: "123" }</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;&lt;&lt; { error: "count cannot be negative", requestId: "123" }</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This becomes even more awkward because now you have to keep track of every message you send, and you have to find some way to bubble the error event back to the UI in an idempotent way. The same goes if you wanted to have some kind of indication that the command was received by the server. In that case, now you’re also dealing with certain hard-to-track edge cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>What if the socket closes before the server can process the command?</li>
<li>What if you never receive a response message on the socket for some reason?</li>
<li>What if you’re dealing with a huge number of concurrent requests?</li>
</ul>
<p>It creates too many unknowns and complexity for something that should be simple. If you’re dealing with messages where you need to know if they were received or not, you’re better off with using a more transactional protocol like HTTP to represent the sending side of the socket.</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span><span>( &lt; &gt; ) = HTTP</span></span>
<span><span>( &lt;&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;&gt; ) = WebSocket</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span># Success</span></span>
<span><span>&gt; POST /increment '{ value: 5 }'</span></span>
<span><span>&lt; 200 OK</span></span>
<span><span>&lt;&lt;&lt; { event: "count", value: 5 }</span></span>
<span><span>#- (the update message still gets sent to all connected clients)</span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<span><span># Failure</span></span>
<span><span>&gt; POST /decrement '{ value: 6 }'</span></span>
<span><span>&lt; 400 Bad Request</span></span>
<span><span>#- (no update gets sent because the request failed)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>We’ve effectively ditched the transmitting side of the socket altogether and replaced it with HTTP, which means we’re now leaning on WebSockets to represent only one stream of data (the receiving side). As it turns out there’s other ways to do that don’t require the overhead of a full duplex connection. <em>(we’ll get into this later)</em></p>
<p><em>If you’re sending messages that don’t necessarily need to be acknowledged (like a heartbeat or keyboard inputs), then Websockets make a great fit. Hence the title of this post, you <strong>might</strong> not need Websockets.</em></p>
<h3 id="you-have-to-manage-the-socket-lifecycle">You have to manage the socket lifecycle</h3>
<p>When you use WebSockets, you’re not just sending and receiving messages at will—your application also has to respond to the opening and closing of the connection. This means handling events like “open” and “close” (or “error”), deciding what to do during reconnect attempts, and cleaning up resources when the connection is no longer needed.</p>
<p>For example, a basic lifecycle for a WebSocket in the browser might look like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="js"><code><span><span>const</span><span> socket</span><span> =</span><span> new</span><span> WebSocket</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>wss://example.com/socket</span><span>"</span><span>);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>socket</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>open</span><span>"</span><span>, () </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>  console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>Socket opened</span><span>"</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>});</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>socket</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>message</span><span>"</span><span>, (</span><span>event</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>  console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>Received message:</span><span>"</span><span>, </span><span>event</span><span>.</span><span>data</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>});</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>socket</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>error</span><span>"</span><span>, (</span><span>err</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>  console</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>Socket error:</span><span>"</span><span>, </span><span>err</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>});</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>socket</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>close</span><span>"</span><span>, () </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>  console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>Socket closed. Attempting to reconnect…</span><span>"</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>  // Potentially restart or schedule a new socket connection here</span></span>
<span><span>});</span></span></code></pre>
<p>In a typical application, you might need to restart a closed connection, buffer messages while the socket is down, and handle retries with exponential backoff. Ignoring any of these steps can lead to lost messages, clumsy user experiences, or lingering connections. By contrast, with a simpler request/response model like HTTP, the lifecycle is more straightforward: each request starts, completes (or fails), and then you move on.</p>
<p>The extra complexity of a WebSocket’s lifecycle is one of the main reasons you might not need it—unless there’s absolutely no alternative to socket based messaging (partially demonstrated in the previous section), then you’re better off with a simpler communication pattern.</p>
<h3 id="it-makes-your-server-code-more-complex">It makes your server code more complex</h3>
<p>When a new WebSocket connection is initiated, your server has to handle the HTTP “upgrade” request handshake. Instead of completing an ordinary request, the server checks for the special headers indicating a WebSocket handshake and then upgrades the connection from HTTP to a persistent socket. That means for every initial connection, the server must parse and validate WebSocket headers like “Sec-WebSocket-Key” and respond with the correct “Sec-WebSocket-Accept” header. (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Sec-WebSocket-Key#websocket_opening_handshake">MDN Reference</a>)</p>
<p>The upgrade mechanism itself requires additional plumbing: you need to create a listener for the upgrade event on your server, confirm the request is valid, finalize the handshake, and then start broadcasting or receiving data. This not only adds more moving parts (compared to standard request/response flows) but also means comprehension of HTTP alone isn’t enough for debugging or troubleshooting—now you’re dealing with a specialized connection protocol.</p>
<p>If you’re also dealing with similar request/response semantics as we’ve detailed above, it can introduce even more complexity since now your server code is written with the durable nature of sockets in mind, not the ephemeral nature of HTTP. Additionally, your application will need to manage all the edge cases: what if the client tries upgrading in an unsupported way? What if the handshake fails mid-stream or times out? What about partial data frames that need to be reassembled?</p>
<p>While libraries and frameworks do a really good job of hiding some of these details under the hood, all these potential points of failure point back to a single truth: if you don’t truly need the power of a bidirectional, always-on socket, the handshake cost and the expanded error states can overshadow any performance or real-time benefits.</p>
<hr>
<p>So what’s the alternative?</p>
<p>We touched on it very briefly in the previous sections, but if we can abstract away the transmitting side of the socket and only be left with a one-way stream of data on the receiving side, we can use a much simpler communication pattern.</p>
<h2 id="http-streaming">HTTP Streaming</h2>
<p>If you look deeper into how HTTP works, you’ll find that it’s actually a protocol designed for streaming data. If it wasn’t, we couldn’t stream video without loading the entire file first, or load huge websites without downloading the whole page.</p>
<p>As it turns out that data stream doesn’t have to be split up chunks of some large blob of data. We can use the same principle to represent any arbitrary stream of data, like the real time updates that we were leaning on WebSockets for.</p>
<p>Here’s an example in server-side JavaScript of how this would look using our counter example from before:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="js"><code><span><span>let</span><span> counter</span><span> =</span><span> 0</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>let</span><span> resolvers</span><span> =</span><span> new</span><span> Set</span><span>();</span></span>

<h3 id="bonus-making-it-easy-with-eventkit">Bonus: Making it easy with eventkit</h3>
<p>This is a little bit of a shameless plug, but it’s my post so you’re just going to have to live with it.</p>
<p>I’ve been working on a library called <a href="https://github.com/hntrl/eventkit">eventkit</a> that makes it easy to compose and observe asynchronous streams of data. If you’re familiar with the observable pattern or RxJS, it’s very similar but with better side effect management and built with generators.</p>

<p>I learned about the capabilities of the Stream API while building it and think it’s a really good candidate for your next real-time/event-based application. If you say otherwise, please <a href="https://github.com/hntrl/eventkit/issues">open an issue</a> and tell me why.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t be a good project maintainer if I didn’t tell you to at least go <a href="https://github.com/hntrl/eventkit?utm_source=hntrl&amp;utm_campaign=ydnw">check it out</a>. We also wrote a separate <a href="https://hntrl.github.io/eventkit/guide/examples/http-streaming?utm_source=hntrl&amp;utm_campaign=ydnw">HTTP Streaming</a> guide that goes a little bit deeper into this topic in case you’re interested.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading this wall of text! If you have any questions/comments, I’m around on <a href="https://x.com/huntlovell">X/Twitter</a>. I also post more schizo ramblings on there, so I would appreciate the follow if that’s the sort of thing you’re into.</p>  <p>(END)</p> </article></div>]]></description>

	<p>Vacheron Constantin's Les Cabinotiers department has done it again, setting a world record for the most complicated wristwatch with the "Solaria Ultra Grand Complication" less than one year after <a href="https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/introducing-vacheron-constantin-berkley-grand-complication" target="_blank">the announcement of the world's most complicated watch</a>. Far from a pocket watch this time, the Solaria features 41 complications, 13 potential patented inventions, and a shockingly modern design and wearable size. Fair warning, this story will (yet again) be the longest we'll run during Watches and Wonders.</p>

	<p>Obviously, the brand is no stranger to high-complication watchmaking over their 270-year history. Their forays into this mini-competition among the world's complications specialists resulted in 2017's Vacheron Constantin Les Cabinotiers Celestia Astronomical Grand Complication 3600, with 23 complications. But they still didn't have nearly the number of complications of the Franck Muller Aeternitas Mega 4, with its 36. But Franck Muller's website is wildly out of date. Not only has the Aeternitas not been the most complicated <i>watch</i> for some time, but it's no longer the most complicated wristwatch either.</p>

  <div><p>Less than a year ago, Vacheron Constantin made the most complicated watch in the world and we were there <a href="https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/video-vacheron-constantin-berkley-grand-comp" target="_blank">to bring you a video about the watch.</a></p></div>
</div>
        <div data-index="6">
	<p>Beyond the awe at the Berkley Grand Comp, there was some fair critique that the 960 gram, 90.8mm diameter by 50.55mm thick "pocket watch" wasn't so much a watch, but a clock (though, where the line of one ends and the other begins is up for debate) or – my favorite comment – a horological kettlebell. "Impressive. Now make a wristwatch version," said one reader. Well, they kind of just did.</p>

    
</div>
        <div data-index="7">
	<p>As they did last year for that watch, Vacheron yet again previewed the Les Cabinotiers Solari this year on the day before Watches and Wonders to a select group of press. That means that, not only do we have all the details, but I also had a chance to go "hands-on” (literally, versus the Berkley which we couldn’t touch) with the watch.&nbsp;</p>

    
</div>
        
        <div data-index="9">
	<p>Alright, we know that the watch has 41 complications and has 13 patents applied for – and we'll get to the specific complications shortly – but I think one of the most impressive things is the size and overall aesthetic of the watch. Vacheron has not shied from tying the idea of "complicated" closely to the word "loud" with watches like the <a href="https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/hands-vacheron-constantin-les-cabinotiers-voyages" target=""><u>2022 Tribute to Bacchus</u></a>, and yet, this has a relatively reserved case design and modern dial language in a wearable package.</p>

	<p>How wearable? The watch measures 45mm by 14.99mm thick. Compare that to the recent Omega Seamaster Planet Ocean World Time, which is 0.5mm larger and 4mm <i>thicker</i>. While these are two different watches with two different use cases (the "Solaria" has no listed water resistance, so I'd say it's just dust-proof), and Vacheron's offering is a unique piece from their high watchmaking arm with no price given, it just goes to show the achievement of micro-mechanics and miniaturisation from Vacheron.</p>

With 1521 components and 204 jewels, the watch runs at 3Hz with a 72-hour power reserve.</p>

	<p>Unlike the Berkley Grand Complication, which was made on commission, the Solaria is a fully Vacheron-driven project. One watchmaker, yes, just one, was given <i>carte blanche</i> to go hog wild and make the most incredible feat of horology he could, and spent eight years on the task. He certainly took full advantage of the brief. There was no budget, and there is no price tag but the watch is for sale. In fact, the Solaria is actually called “the Premiere” to end its official name, because the program is open to orders with future examples modified in ways to keep them all unique. Yet each would have the full suite of complications. We will have a list of all the complications at the end, but here are some highlights.</p>

	<p>Yes, there are the normal (and extremely complex) chiming complications, a chronograph, and a tourbillon, but in this case, the Westminster minute repeater mechanism is integrated into the base movement along with the chronograph mechanism and tourbillon regulator. The Civil time display module is also coupled to the base movement, while Sidereal time runs independently.</p>

	<p>There is a Gregorian perpetual calendar and a second time zone display.

The astronomical display also gives high and low tides for a selected city (as it does sunrise, sunset, moonphase, and age of the moon), but it also gives you the date of the Spring tide and the neap tide (seven days after a spring tide when there is a period of moderate tides and the sun and moon are at right angles to each other).</p>

	<p>The most fascinating complication (or combination of them), in my opinion, is the use of the column-wheel split-second chronograph as an astronomical tool. The rear of the watch features a display of the "celestial vault" (the apparent surface of the sky) with two overlapping sapphire displays. It's complicated (for lack of a better word), so bear with me.</p>

    
</div>
        <div data-index="21">
	<p>First, the rear dial displays a full slate of constellations for the night sky above a chosen location and displays the changing view of the constellations in real-time. The split-second chronograph is mounted in the middle of this display while another disc in the center of the dial has a green arrow that points to an hour between 0 and 24. There's also another green index line halfway from the center of the dial to the edge. As explained by Vacheron, this is how you use them:</p>

When the chronograph hand reaches the green reference marker, stop the first hand but let the second hand continue until it reaches the current position of the chosen star, then stop the hand. The time (in hours) that must elapse until the user will see the chosen star in the sky is indicated by the green triangle on the small counter in the centre of the dial. The peripheral month display marked on the back crystal enables the wearer to adjust the celestial vault to reflect the Earth's position in its orbit around the Sun."</p>

	<p>Last but not least, the display is – you guessed it – very complex.

Each sapphire disc is only 0.18mm.</p>

	<p>From an aesthetic point of view, it took me a little time to appreciate the use of so much color on the dial. At first I thought the use of so much yellow, red, and green made the watch look less serious than I'd expect the most complicated wristwatch to look. Eventually I realized that each of these colors wildly increases legibility and makes it much more modern than any other ultra-complication ever made. It also is much more muted in person than the provided photos. In short, it’s one of the most visually balanced multi-complications possible.</p>

	<p>Understanding the achievements of the Berkley Grand Complication last year required considerable knowledge and explanation of the Chinese calendar and its application in the Chinese perpetual calendar.

	<p>Why does this matter? Well, the brand has used pieces like this in the past as proving grounds for things they could integrate into future, more commercial releases. For instance, the spherical tourbillon from the 57260 made its way into the various versions of the <a href="https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/hands-vacheron-constantin-les-cabinotiers-voyages" target=""><u>Les Cabinotiers Armillary Tourbillon</u></a> we've seen over the years. This is even more likely in a watch with a movement size that is more applicable to other wristwatches.</p>

        <div data-index="32">
	<p>There are two patents for time indications. The first is a "plug and play" mounting system for aligning and securing the astronomical displays while allowing easy service and indexing. Second is a new system for universal time that allows the local time to be disassociated from home time, but using a differential instead of a spring as has been used in the past. The split-seconds chronograph also has a new split-seconds insulator system that is meant to allow better isochronism and vibration reduction.</p>

	<p>The bulk of the patent applications are actually for the minute repeater – a total of seven. They've reworked the minute repeater architecture with developments to optimise the size of the hammers and maximise the energy transmitted to the hammers and, therefore, the gongs for a better sound. I was surprised to hear that this meant that they actually shrunk the hammers, which minimized backlash, and made them out of steel for more power with 18K gold added on three of them. They're also arranged in a novel way, with pairs of hammers on each side of the baseplate. Finally, there's a new mode selector system for selecting the striking mode on demand of the repeater, choosing between hours only or engaging the entire striking mechanism with hours, quarters, and minutes.</p>

	<p>I think there's no way to convey how fascinating a watch like this is and how difficult it is to comprehend that I've been looking at a watch that's so technical (with a dial that reflects that) but is only 0.6mm thicker than IWC's Eternal Calendar from last year. It's also just a testament to how far watchmaking technology has come to make a watch like this.</p>

	The Complications, 1 Through 41
</p></div>
        <div data-index="38">
	<p>Just as we did for the Berkley Grand Complication, I thought it might be useful to break down the 41 complications of the Solaria one by one. One thing to note: one of the listed complications is the tourbillon, which is a regulating organ (albeit a complex one to make). The debate about whether it's a complication is so fierce that the only way to win is not to play the game. When I asked Ben his opinion on this recently, he said, "Even though it's not one, it is one," which I think sums it up perfectly.</p>

	<p>That said, if you have the facts and are voting no on the tourbillon, Vacheron credits itself for only one complication for the second time zone hours <i>and</i> minutes (two different complications by my count), so the number could be 40, 41, or even 42 complications. Either way, there's no doubt that this watch stakes the claim to be the most complicated wristwatch in the world with the following functions.</p>

It's been energizing and eye-opening. Six months ago, I wouldn’t trust AI to do much beyond autocomplete. Now, I don’t want to code without it.</p><p>But despite all that progress, I keep running into the same issue—one that takes me back to my very first computer science class.</p><p><span>Way back in college, I took one of the earliest iterations of the now-famous </span><strong>CS50 course at Harvard</strong><span>, taught by the fantastic Margo Seltzer. Today, CS50 is taught online globally and is one of the most popular computer science courses. But back then, it wasn’t famous. And we got to do a classroom exercise that still sticks with me (yes, pun intended), and which they </span><em>still</em><span> teach to this day.</span></p><p>On the first day of class, Margo walked in carrying a loaf of bread, a jar of peanut butter, and a jar of jelly.</p><p>“I’m a computer,” she told us. “You are the programmers. Give me instructions—one step at a time—on how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.”</p><p>And then came the chaos.</p><p><span>The first student said, “Take some bread out of the bag.” Instead of nicely taking two slices out, Margo proceeded to </span><em>rip</em><span> a hole in the bag and crush five or six slices into a mashed lump in her fist - because that also means "take some bread out of the bag".</span></p><p>The next person said, “Put the bread down.” Margo dropped the clump onto the floor. After all, “down” could mean the ground.</p><p><span>Then someone tried: “Put jelly on the bread.” You know where this is going... Margo dumped the </span><em>entire jar</em><span> of jelly directly onto the pile. No spoon. No spreading. Just one catastrophic glob of sugar.</span></p><p><span>By the end, there was peanut butter, jelly, and bread </span><em>everywhere</em><span>. No sandwich. But we’d learned the point: </span><strong>you have to be super clear in your instructions or it won't know what you want.</strong></p><p><span>LLMs are undeniably more advanced than the computers of 20 years ago. Honestly, today’s AI could probably make a decent peanut butter and jelly sandwich. They’d likely infer that you want </span><em>two</em><span> slices of bread, placed on a counter, spread neatly with a normal amount of jelly and peanut butter.</span></p><p>But the problem reappears when you move past familiar territory. Using AI tools often feels like working with a junior developer from across the globe—someone fast, capable, and willing, but who lacks your product context, customer insight, or nuance.</p><p>If your “sandwich” is a product that doesn’t have an obvious recipe—a novel app, an unfamiliar UX, or a unique set of features—LLMs struggle. They’re great at copying what’s been done before, remixing code that already exists. But ask for something new? Something creative, or specific to your vision? Something that "just works" for a specific use-case? Now you’re back to giving vague or ambiguous instructions to a junior developer from across the globe, who doesn’t know your customer, your context, or what “done right” actually looks like.</p><p>Living on the frontlines of the AI-rena has taught me that prompt engineering isn’t the real bottleneck. The real differentiator is clarity and communication. And I don’t mean the kind of prompt engineering where you trick the AI into doing something by telling it its grandmother is going to die or pretending it's an expert in a field. This is something much harder: having a clear, precise vision of what you want built, knowing what "right" looks like, and being able to explain it step by step—and course-correct when the AI veers off track.</p><p>This ability to define your desired outcome in crisp, complete terms is one of the most important superpowers of the AI era. AI can only infer so much—you still need to give it context and clear instructions.</p><p>Most people won’t do that. They’ll wave their hands, type vague “best practices” prompts, and hope the AI figures it out. And they’ll often end up with a gooey mess on their hands.</p><p>In the AI-rena, success won’t go to the fastest coders, but to those who can both clearly understand and explain how to turn a fuzzy idea into something that actually works... and maybe even walk away with a sandwich that didn’t end up on the floor.</p><p>Footnotes:</p><ol><li><p>This was hard to write—while the class was about making a pb&amp;j, I personally hate peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.</p></li><li><p><span>You can see videos of this the PB&amp;J lecture </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okkIyWhN0iQ&amp;ref=iamcharliegraham.com" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">here</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euFj8D1A1Kw&amp;ref=iamcharliegraham.com" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">here</a><span>. I remember it being far more chaotic &amp; messy our year though!</span></p></li></ol></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>
