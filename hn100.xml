<p>A landmark case in the UK concerning Apple’s App Store practices has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/apple-loses-uk-lawsuit-over-app-store-commissions-2025-10-23/">just been decided</a>, with a London tribunal ruling against the company in a move that could cost Apple up to $2 billion.</p>



<h2 id="h-london-tribunal-rules-that-apple-overcharged-app-developers-for-years-with-unfair-commissions">London tribunal rules that Apple overcharged app developers for years with unfair commissions</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/apple-loses-uk-lawsuit-over-app-store-commissions-2025-10-23/">Sam Tobin writes at <em>Reuters</em></a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Apple abused its dominant position by charging app developers unfair commissions, a London tribunal ruled on Thursday, in a blow which could leave the U.S. tech company on the hook for hundreds of millions of pounds in damages.</p>



<p>The Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) ruled against Apple after a trial of the lawsuit, which was brought on behalf of millions of iPhone and iPad users in the United Kingdom.</p>



<p>The CAT ruled that Apple had abused its dominant position from October 2015 until the end of 2020 by shutting out competition in the app distribution market and by “charging excessive and unfair prices” as commission to developers. […]</p>



<p>The case had been valued at around 1.5 billion pounds ($2 billion) by those who brought it. A hearing next month will decide how damages are calculated and Apple’s application for permission to appeal.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Apple has already said it will appeal the ruling, which the company said “takes a flawed view of the thriving and competitive app economy”.</p>



<p>The estimated $2 billion in damages that might be enforced is expected to combine several different factors.</p>



<p>Per <em>Reuters</em>:</p>



<ul>
<li>“developers were overcharged by the difference between a 17.5% commission for app purchases and the commission Apple charged, which Kent’s lawyers said was usually 30%.” </li>



<li>“The CAT also ruled that app developers passed on 50% of the overcharge to consumers.”</li>
</ul>



<p>We will keep you posted on any further developments with the case, including Apple’s appeal and the actual damages when they are calculated next month.</p>

Rather, what passed through the mathematicians as they struggled with problems were such things as vibrations in their hands, nonsense words in their ears, or blurry shapes in their heads.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-176849955" href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/wordless-thought#footnote-1-176849955" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span></p><p><span>Hadamard, who had the same types of experiences, wrote in </span><em>The Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field </em><span>that this mode of thinking was distinct from daydreaming, and that most people, though they often think wordlessly, have never experienced the kind of processing that the mathematicians did.</span></p><p><span>When I read this, in December 2024, all sorts of questions arose in me. First of all, what does it even mean? Do they not think in words and equations </span><em>at all</em><span>? And secondly, how do I square this with my personal experience, which is that whenever I write what I think about a subject, it always turns out that my thoughts do not hold up on paper? No matter how confident I am in my thoughts, they reveal themselves on the page as little but logical holes, contradictions, and non sequiturs.</span></p><p><span>I recognize myself when</span><a href="https://paulgraham.com/words.html?viewfullsite=1" rel=""> Paul Graham writes</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>The reason I’ve spent so long establishing [that writing helps you refine your thinking] is that it leads to another [point] that many people will find shocking. If writing down your ideas always makes them more precise and more complete, then no one who hasn’t written about a topic has fully formed ideas about it. And someone who never writes has no fully formed ideas about anything nontrivial.</p></blockquote><p><span>How come Hadamard’s colleagues are able to have productive thoughts, working in their heads, without words, sometimes, for </span><em>days</em><span> on end?</span></p><p>Hadamard’s book is most famous for its detailed discussion of what Henri Poincaré called the “sudden illumination”—the moment when the solution to a problem emerges “in the shower” unexpectedly after a long period of unconscious incubation.</p><p><span>The hypothesis here is that if you work hard on a problem, you soak your subconscious with it. Wrestling with a problem helps you build a mental model of what you know and what you don’t—providing the subconscious with building blocks to work with. (You can’t have genuine intuition and inspiration in areas where you lack knowledge.) Then, once you drop the problem from conscious thought and go take care of the dishes or something, the subconscious begins a silent and parallelized search, trying many, many alternatives (in a somewhat random fashion), until something snaps in place. When this happens, the solution bubbles back up to the conscious mind, as if out of </span><em>nowhere</em><span>, making you freeze mid-motion with a stack of dirty plates in your hands.</span></p><p>This is a very useful thing to know about the mind, because it means you can steer your subconscious towards the particular problems you want it to work on. By priming yourself with important problems before doing the dishes or going for walks or sleeping, you make sure your mental resources are used on what matters for you, instead of, for example, the open loops in a Netflix series you watched before bed. It is free labor.</p><p>But—this is not what Hadamard is talking about when he describes the wordless thought of the mathematicians and researchers he has surveyed. Instead, what they seem to be doing is something similar to this subconscious, parallelized search, except they do it in a “tensely” focused way.</p><p>The impression I get is that Hadamard loads a question into his mind (either in a non-verbal way, or by reading a mathematical problem that has been written by himself or someone else), and then he holds the problem effortfully centered in his mind. Effortfully, but wordlessly, and without clear visualizations. Describing the mental image that filled his mind while working on a problem concerning infinite series for his thesis, Hadamard writes that his mind was occupied by an image of a ribbon which was thicker in certain places (corresponding to possibly important terms). He also saw something that looked like equations, but as if seen from a distance, without glasses on: he was unable to make out what they said.</p><p><span>I’m not sure what is going on here. But here’s a speculation. As I understand it, when one part of our brain is working, it often inhibits another—if you</span><a href="https://sanlab.psych.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/31/2015/05/Lieberman_AL-2007.pdf" rel=""> put words to distressing feelings</a><span>, for example, the language-oriented parts of your brain inhibit the amygdala, which reduces the emotional distress. Similarly, when you are focused on a task at hand, the executive control network of your brain will tend to inhibit the default mode network which is responsible for mind wandering. (This might explain why illuminations tend to occur mainly in the shower, when the executive control networks downregulate and the mind is allowed to wander.)</span></p><p><span>Here’s my speculation: perhaps Hadamard and the other great mathematicians are able to enter into a modality of thought where they are able to keep </span><em>both</em><span> the default mode network and the executive control network on at the same time. Perhaps this allows them to do a sort of subconscious, in-the-shower-type processing, while still maintaining enough conscious focus to ensure the thoughts don’t drift away from the problem and its constraints.</span></p><p><span>When I look into this, I notice that there is research indicating that when doing certain types of creative work, the default mode network and the executive control network are, indeed,</span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4724474/" rel=""> active at the same time</a><span>, which they usually aren’t. Individuals who are experienced in a creative field seem to have the capacity to keep the default mode network turned on, allowing them to generate many permutations of ideas, while </span><em>steering</em><span> it with the executive control network, ensuring their parallelized mindwandering is constrained by the facts of the problem. I suspect we are all capable of this to some extent, but doing it to the extent Hadamard’s subjects did is akin to a ballerina spinning on her toes: a mental posture that requires serious practice to develop the necessary muscles and coordination.</span></p><p>I’m not well-versed in neuroscience enough to know if I’m interpreting this right; I’m just speculating.</p><p><span>But what we </span><em>do</em><span> know is that Hadamard, as he worked, would pace up and down his room with what “witnesses to [his] daily life and work” called his “inside” look. (Others, like Poincaré and Helmholtz, seem to have sat at their desks, staring into nowhere.) And this type of deep, consciously-blurry concentration could go on for a long time: Hadamard mentions that he only stopped walking if he needed to write down a proof (reluctantly). An acquaintance writes that a friend of his shared an office with one of the best now living physicists; this physicist’s work habit was to come into the office in the morning and then stare into the wall for 8 hours before going home. Imagine holding a productive thought for that long without writing any steps down and, presumably, without even compressing things into words inside your head!</span></p><p>Hadamard writes that he sometimes used algebraic signs when dealing with easy calculations, but adds that, “whenever the matter looks more difficult, they become too heavy a baggage for me.”</p><p><span>Why are words </span><em>too heavy</em><span>?</span></p><p><span>Reasoning from my experience, I suspect it is because words are laborious. When we put words to a thought, we have to compress something that is like a web in our mind, filled with connections and associations going in all directions, turning that web into a sequential string of words; we have to compress what is high-dimensional into something low-dimensional. This has all sorts of advantages, which I will return to, but the point I want to emphasize here is that compression is </span><em>effortful</em><span>. It takes intense concentration to find the right words (rather than the sloppy ones that first come to mind), and then to put them in the proper order. As James Joyce said to his friend when he was asked why he looked so gloomy, “I’ve only written seven words today…” “But why then are you in despair—seven words is a lot for you!” “I don’t know in which order to put them…”</span></p><p><span>If we can avoid the compression step, and do the manipulations directly in the high-dimensional, non-linguistic, conceptual space, we can move much faster.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-176849955" href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/wordless-thought#footnote-2-176849955" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span></p><p><span>But this is a big </span><em>if</em><span>. Most people, myself included, have too weak mental models to do this kind of processing for complex problems, and so, our thoughts are riddled with contradictions and holes that we often don’t notice unless we try to write them down. We can move faster in wordless thought, but we’re moving at random. If, however, you have deep expertise in an area, like the mathematicians, it is possible to let go of the language compression and do a much faster search. M, who started his career as a physicist, tells me that when he was 13 and read that Einstein thought without words, he felt disappointed since his mind didn’t work like that; then, “a decade and many thousands of hours of mathematics and physics later,” he reread the passage and recognized himself almost completely. I guess this was because the labor of learning mathematics, done largely through reading and writing his way through complex ideas and problems, had given him deep enough mental models to make words somewhat superfluous.</span></p><p>But even then, as Hadamard notes, writing is a necessary step of the process. The insights arrived at wordlessly need to be submitted to the rigor of mathematical notation and logic, to test their validity. It is a sort of feedback mechanism: unless the intuition holds up on the page, it is a false intuition.</p><p><span>The written results also work as </span><em>relay results</em><span>. By writing something down and making sure it is solid, we can offload that thought from working memory and instead use it as a building block for the next step of the thought. Or, to use a metaphor by the mathematician William Hamilton, deep thinking is like building a tunnel through a sandbank:</span></p><blockquote><p>In this operation, it is impossible to succeed unless every foot, nay, almost every inch in our progress be secured by an arch of masonry before we attempt the excavation of another. Now, language is to the mind precisely what the arch is to the tunnel. The power of thinking and the power of excavation are not dependent on the words in the one case, on the mason-work in the other; but without these subsidiaries, neither process could be carried on beyond its rudimentary commencement.</p></blockquote><p><span>So writing—and</span><a href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/how-i-read" rel=""> reading, seriously, the writings of others</a><span>—is a way to collect stepping stones: ideas that have been stabilized enough that they can carry us as we walk deeper into the thought space.</span></p><p><span>But this stabilization of meaning can go wrong, too, if we stabilize ideas that aren’t ready to be stabilized yet. When writing, there are all sorts of details that need to be specified for our paragraphs to make sense, and if we don’t </span><em>know</em><span> what should go into a sentence, it is all too easy to fill in the uncertain parts with guesses. At least my brain has the most miraculous autocomplete function and supplies me with credible endings to any sentence I start—often credible </span><em>nonsense</em><span>. But when the nonsense is there on the page, next to thoughts I’ve settled through hard work, it looks respectable! It often takes considerable work to realize I’ve fooled myself.</span></p><p><span>This was another reason Hadamard’s subjects gave for why they were reluctant to use words: they were afraid of the false precision writing forces onto thinking. They were afraid of premature precision and the confusion it breeds. By thinking in blurry images, or tensions of the hands, or sounds, they could keep their thoughts accurately vague in the areas where there was still uncertainty. They wrote down on paper, as settled, only mostly what was </span><em>actually</em><span> known. If you are disciplined, you can write in such a way that you avoid false precision.</span></p><p>To sum up: the relationship between verbal thinking and deep wordless concentration is complex.</p><ul><li><p>Non-verbal, blurry thinking is faster and can search in a broader way, but it is more error-prone than verbal thought.</p></li><li><p><span>Good writing tends to come from an attempt to</span><a href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/write-about-the-concrete" rel=""> capture in words something you understand wordlessly</a><span>, rather than moving ideas around on the page; but, paradoxically, a generative subconscious is usually one that has been trained by writing and deep reading, which provides the subconscious with relay results and other mental structures necessary for deep thought.</span></p></li><li><p>Writing forces precision, which can fool us into locking in details we have no reason to lock in, but written notes (or drawings) are a necessary aid when thinking long chains of thoughts.</p></li></ul><p>Over the last nine months, as I’ve been thinking about this topic, I’ve become more mindful about when words hinder and when they help. I notice that I spend more time in wordless thoughts than I used to. But I’m also more deliberate about using writing to structure my brain so it feeds me better thoughts.</p><p><em>As always, a big thank you to the paying subscribers who fund the work on the public essays.

<p>The Ubuntu Project has <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-security-announce/2025-October/009890.html">announced</a>
that a bug in the Rust-based <a href="https://uutils.github.io/">uutils</a> version of the
<tt>date</tt> command shipped with Ubuntu&nbsp;25.10 broke automatic
updates:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some Ubuntu 25.10 systems have been unable to automatically check
for available software updates. Affected machines include cloud
deployments, container images, Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server
installs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The announcement includes remediation instructions for those
affected by the bug. Systems with the <tt>rust-coreutils</tt> package
version 0.2.2-0ubuntu2 or earlier have the bug, it is fixed in
0.2.2-0ubuntu2.1 or later. It does not impact manual updates using the
<tt>apt</tt> command or other utilities.</p>

<p>Ubuntu embarked on a project to "oxidize" the distribution by
switching to uutils and <a href="https://github.com/trifectatechfoundation/sudo-rs?tab=readme-ov-file#sudo-rs">sudo-rs</a>
for the 25.10 release, and to see if the Rust-based utilities would be
suitable for the long-term-release slated for next April. LWN <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1014002/">covered</a> that project in
March.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>In my mind, "Apple" as a brand used to be synonymous with "attention to detail" but sadly, over the course of the last 8 - 10 years, their choices have become anything but detail oriented.&nbsp;</p><p>This year, things have gotten so bad that I'm starting to think they've stopped caring about user experience, accessibility, and detailed QA tests altogether.&nbsp;</p><p>I'd rather write less and show you more. So let's go through a couple of examples that made me feel heartbroken and eventually made me stop using some Apple products.</p><p>If you are privacy conscious like me, and don't give the Reminders app permission to access your location, it will ask you for location permissions <em>every single damn time</em> you launch it. Need to remember something while you're in the flow? Forget about it, this popup will steal your keyboard's focus. Need to check an item off your list? nope. not today, give permissions.&nbsp;</p><p>For a company that over-uses the word "privacy" in all their presentations, why are these my only two options? "Open System Settings" and "Not Now"?</p><p>I thought perhaps if I update Mac OS X this would go away, but I was wrong. Not only that popup's here to stay, this time I was interrupted with the most ironic notification:</p><p>Would you like to take a break from notifications? Click this ironic notification popup.&nbsp;</p><p>The talented folks in Cupertino can't seem to decide where to put the search bar in their apps. So if you're trying to search for something, you first have to search for the search bar itself.</p><p>For some reason, Mac OS X doesn't have a standard and consistent design for tabs.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/1_0JaHtonzuAP8_EwjLrx-FA.jpeg" alt="" width="2000" height="148" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" srcset="https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/1_0JaHtonzuAP8_EwjLrx-FA-xs.jpeg 300w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/1_0JaHtonzuAP8_EwjLrx-FA-sm.jpeg 480w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/1_0JaHtonzuAP8_EwjLrx-FA-md.jpeg 749w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/1_0JaHtonzuAP8_EwjLrx-FA-xl.jpeg 1200w"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/1_JKNuB7_Fnxbe7gjIYC1bqQ.jpeg" alt="" width="2000" height="127" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" srcset="https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/1_JKNuB7_Fnxbe7gjIYC1bqQ-xs.jpeg 300w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/1_JKNuB7_Fnxbe7gjIYC1bqQ-sm.jpeg 480w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/1_JKNuB7_Fnxbe7gjIYC1bqQ-md.jpeg 749w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/1_JKNuB7_Fnxbe7gjIYC1bqQ-xl.jpeg 1200w"></figure><p>Apps like <strong>Calendar</strong>, <strong>Activity Monitor</strong> and <strong>TV</strong> show tabs in the header or title bar, each with a different tab design.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/1_9z4K8l9t8Wwy6qo_654NZw.jpeg" alt="" width="2000" height="257" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" srcset="https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/1_9z4K8l9t8Wwy6qo_654NZw-xs.jpeg 300w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/1_9z4K8l9t8Wwy6qo_654NZw-sm.jpeg 480w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/1_9z4K8l9t8Wwy6qo_654NZw-md.jpeg 749w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/1_9z4K8l9t8Wwy6qo_654NZw-xl.jpeg 1200w"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/1_PKq42hL0DdtIdw919W48PQ-5.jpeg" alt="" width="2000" height="225" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" srcset="https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/1_PKq42hL0DdtIdw919W48PQ-5-xs.jpeg 300w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/1_PKq42hL0DdtIdw919W48PQ-5-sm.jpeg 480w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/1_PKq42hL0DdtIdw919W48PQ-5-md.jpeg 749w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/1_PKq42hL0DdtIdw919W48PQ-5-xl.jpeg 1200w"></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/1_grXrBWjU-0OqSuEgzyvELw.jpeg" alt="" width="2000" height="211" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" srcset="https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/1_grXrBWjU-0OqSuEgzyvELw-xs.jpeg 300w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/1_grXrBWjU-0OqSuEgzyvELw-sm.jpeg 480w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/1_grXrBWjU-0OqSuEgzyvELw-md.jpeg 749w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/1_grXrBWjU-0OqSuEgzyvELw-xl.jpeg 1200w"></figure><hr><p>By now you must be rightfully thinking "but John these are all old screenshots, updates to Mac OS X and iOS must have addressed these issues... right?", dear reader allow me to introduce you to the UI/UX hell that is Mac OS 26 and iOS 26 that not only did not fix these issues, but introduced much worse design choices.</p><p>Don't believe me?&nbsp;</p><p>Take a look at the <strong>Search Bar </strong><span><em>(if one can still call it that)</em></span><strong> </strong>in<strong> Finder</strong></p><p>I dare say, wouldn't it be rather logical to expect that an app called 'Finder'—whose entire existence hinges upon the concept of <strong><em>finding things</em></strong>—might offer a search bar that doesn't require a bloody archaeology degree to unearth?

Notice anything missing? Like the folder name or the barely visible down arrow? It's almost as if they haven't tested iOS 26 in dark mode at all.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/files.jpg" alt="" width="1476" height="568" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" srcset="https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/files-xs.jpg 300w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/files-sm.jpg 480w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/files-md.jpg 749w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/files-xl.jpg 1200w"></figure><hr><h3>Share sheet</h3><p>Immediately after updating to iOS 26, I took screen captures of all the broken things, and wanted to share them&nbsp;with a bunch of friends to warn them not to update. I pressed share, and this is what the app icons in the share sheet looked like :&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/IMG_8639.jpg" alt="" width="1102" height="722" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" srcset="https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_8639-xs.jpg 300w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_8639-sm.jpg 480w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_8639-md.jpg 749w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/IMG_8639-xl.jpg 1200w"></figure><p>Already off to a great start, I thought perhaps enabling / disabling the "reduced transparency" accessibility mode would solve things — just in case if liquid glass itself is the issue.&nbsp;</p><hr><h3>Settings</h3><p>So I fired up Settings to disable transparency, and none of the icons showed up there at first.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/settings.jpeg" alt="" width="369" height="800" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" srcset="https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/settings-xs.jpeg 300w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/settings-sm.jpeg 480w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/settings-md.jpeg 749w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/settings-xl.jpeg 1200w"></figure><p>Feeling frustrated beyond measure, I enabled "reduced transparency" mode, which fixed the icons but broke other things even further. See the black bar at the bottom behind the search bubble?&nbsp;</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/settings2.gif" alt="" width="400" height="194"></figure><p>Not a huge deal when you have a massive search bar at the bottom of the screen, but it's still fugly. I thought I'd add this to my running list in the reminders app as well. So then I fired up reminders ...</p><hr><h3>Reminders</h3><p>Immediately upon starting the app I noticed a very large black bar at the bottom of the screen that just wouldn't go away no matter what I did.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/reminders.gif" alt="" width="400" height="97"></figure><p>Alright perhaps reduced transparency broke some things... Let's turn it off, put the phone down, and switch to the iPad. That's gotta be better right?&nbsp;</p><hr><h3>Folders</h3><p>So I grabbed my iPad, and hovered my mouse over a bunch of folders. You know, it's literally the first thing you do. Immediately noticed that the <strong>liquid</strong> <span>gl</span><strong>ass</strong> effect wouldn't go away after a while, and I was left with shiny <strong>liquid</strong> <span>gl</span><strong>ass</strong> folders.&nbsp;</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/liquid-ass.gif" alt="" width="1236" height="582"></figure><p>I thought to myself: "perhaps I'm holding it wrong, let me fire up a browser and see if others have similar problems".&nbsp;</p><hr><h3>Browsers</h3><p>Turns out with iOS 26, Apple broke all 3rd party browsers in thousand different ways. Why? Because WebKit has a ton of issues in iOS 26, and Apple has been forcing all third party browsers to use WebKit — <a href="https://blog.crypt.ee/apples-billion-dollar-stonewall-our-view-from-the-eu-dma-workshop-hearing/">I have a hundred problems with this, and I frequently talk about them in Brussels, but I'll save my energy for the next EU DMA hearing</a>, and instead focus on other stuff in this blog post.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's start with a simple task shall we? Let's fire up Google using my favorite browser Vivaldi, and type literally anything into the search bar:</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/IMG_8654.gif" alt="" width="960" height="693"></figure><p>The autofill bar jumps with every keystroke. And if you're thinking "John but that's just Vivaldi" — it's not. (<em>BTW the talented folks at Vivaldi fixed this and many other WebKit related bugs right away and it's my absolute favorite browser, you should give it a try</em>) There's a broader issue with how Apple's webkit wants to deal with viewports in iOS 26. Let's take a look at other browsers, say for example, Apple's own steaming hot mess of a browser, Safari.</p><figure><video loading="lazy" width="480" height="960" controls="controls" data-mce-fragment="1"><source src="https://files.johnozbay.com/blog/ios26/safari-liquid-ass.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></figure><p>Let's count all the issues in this single 20 second long video shall we?&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>0:00 — 0:01<br></strong></span><span>Why are all the bottom bar buttons flashing like they're sending out an SOS? </span><span>(I'm guessing they're supposed to behave like the address bar but for whatever reason they don't?)</span></p><p><span><strong>0:00 — 0:01<br></strong></span><span>Buttons are white, address bar is black!</span></p><p><strong>0:02 — 0:04<br></strong>See buttons strangely flashing in the bottom? They're screaming for help.</p><p><strong>0:02 — 0:04<br></strong>Content scrolls behind the clock, so the top part of the browser is a complete mess</p><p><strong>0:02 — 0:04<br></strong>Content scrolls behind the buttons and the address bar, so the bottom part of the browser is a complete mess</p><p><strong>0:00 — 0:07<br></strong>The darker backdrop of Google's consent popup is cut off above the address bar.<br>This is because the viewport is royally fucked up in iOS 26, causing all sorts of other issues.</p><p><strong>0:10 — 0:12<br></strong>I don't know about you, but I switch tabs more often than I add pages to favorites or bookmarks. Yet, somehow switching tabs is now a two-tap action that requires a nauseating flash, with all the buttons changing colors.</p><div><p>So many nauseating flashy elements for no real reason.</p><hr><h3><strong>In app browsers are an even bigger mess</strong></h3><p>Remember how I mentioned the viewport is fucked up? It expands below the bottom UI on scroll, and makes fixed elements below inaccessible.</p><figure><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/iab-issues.jpg" alt="https://x.com/mrahmadawais/status/1969622632489500687" width="479" height="480" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" srcset="https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/iab-issues-xs.jpg 300w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/iab-issues-sm.jpg 480w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/iab-issues-md.jpg 749w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/iab-issues-xl.jpg 1200w"></figure><figcaption>https://x.com/mrahmadawais/status/1969622632489500687</figcaption></figure><hr><h3>Alignment doesn't matter</h3><p>By now you must be thinking, "John, stop it—you're not that good at aligning things yourself either." Yep, but I'm also not a $3 trillion company trying to sell essentially the same $1000 phone year after year, this time with a horrible design update. So yeah, I suck at consistently aligning things myself, but I also don't need to align things as well as they do.</p><p>Now let's take a look at Safari and any other Apple app's UI side by side to better understand and confirm that Apple's design teams don't actually talk to each other. Chances are there are either multiple design guideline documents, or Apple stopped caring about design consistency across their apps altogether.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/safari-vs-apple-music.jpg" alt="" width="1880" height="2044" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" srcset="https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/safari-vs-apple-music-xs.jpg 300w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/safari-vs-apple-music-sm.jpg 480w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/safari-vs-apple-music-md.jpg 749w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/safari-vs-apple-music-xl.jpg 1200w"></figure><hr><h3>iMessages</h3><p>First off <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> is awesome, it's cross platform, it's free, and you should use it with all your friends! I personally don't use iMessages, but some people do for whatever reason. Many of my friends in the U.S. seem to have some sort of unhealthy obsession with the color of their chat bubbles. Is it green or is it blue?</p><p>"Texts are green and imessages are blue, Apple loves to manipulate you!"</p><p>Executives at Apple LOVE this game of social pressure.</p><p>Can't afford a shitty $1000 iPhone? Too bad, your messages will be green, and your friends will shame you into social isolation until you buy yourself an iPhone because green bubbles are carcinogenic.</p><p>I can't believe I'm about to write this, but I think the liquid glass design team got one thing right. I think that liquid glass will end these holy messenger wars. Why? Because iMessage is absolutely trash now. iOS 26 gently nudges you to choose a background image for your text messages, which makes it nearly impossible to read the text or see photos sent to you in the messages. Where even is the input field!?!?</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/imessages-mess-2.jpeg" alt="" width="368" height="800" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" srcset="https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/imessages-mess-2-xs.jpeg 300w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/imessages-mess-2-sm.jpeg 480w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/imessages-mess-2-md.jpeg 749w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/imessages-mess-2-xl.jpeg 1200w"></figure><p><em><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/liquid-glass/">This screenshot btw is from the incredible blog post by the Nielsen Norman Group and suffice to say they were much kinder than me in their blog post about Liquid Glass.</a></em></p><hr><h3>App Library</h3><p>Don't get me wrong, I do like trillion dollar tech companies to be transparent, but this right here is certainly not what I meant when I said : "Apple needs to be more transparent". I would love to —at the very least— be able to see the icons of the apps. Sometimes they show up, sometimes they don't. Even the pigeons outside my window are more reliable than the app icons in the library.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/no-icons-3.jpg" alt="" width="370" height="800" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" srcset="https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/no-icons-3-xs.jpg 300w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/no-icons-3-sm.jpg 480w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/no-icons-3-md.jpg 749w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/no-icons-3-xl.jpg 1200w"></figure><h3>Why this blog post?</h3><p>Over the course of the past 2 years, I've spent countless hours chatting with friends trying to explain why I started to passionately dislike Apple's attitude, especially as someone who used to look up to the company. <a href="https://brucelawson.co.uk/2025/are-developers-falling-out-of-love-with-apple/">My good friend Bruce Lawson wrote an incredible blog post talking about this phenomenon, about how developers are falling out of love with Apple</a>. I believe with the introduction of iOS 26 many designers are starting to fall out of love with Apple too. So I decided to gather some of my thoughts in this compact blog post, because why not. &nbsp;</p><p>Apple's design language now accurately reflects their anti-competitive shittiness. Liquid glass is like a black widow's red hourglass. Nature's way of screaming 'stay the fuck away,' but for Apple products.</p><p>Liquid glass and iOS 26 are so badly broken that I can't even possibly list all the issues I have with it. So this blog post is by no means meant to be an inclusive list, and there are at least 100 other problems.</p><p>Off the top of my head:</p><ul><li><span>notifications are practically unreadable if you have a lighter background,</span>&nbsp;</li><li>forget about using the control center, it's essentially a disco-ball.</li><li>battery life is significantly worse for users passionately holding onto their iPhone 12 mini and 13 mini thanks to these design changes — not to mention how the new liquid glass UI doesn't scale down well for the smaller screens of mini iphones.</li><li>goodbye accessibility</li><li>a ton of apps like email have text-on-top-of text</li></ul><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/email-mess.jpeg" alt="" width="1205" height="874" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" srcset="https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/email-mess-xs.jpeg 300w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/email-mess-sm.jpeg 480w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/email-mess-md.jpeg 749w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/email-mess-xl.jpeg 1200w"></figure><p><em>(image from <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/liquid-glass/">Raluca's post on Nielsen Norman Group's blog</a>)</em></p><hr><h3>Closing Notes</h3><p>Look, I've got nothing but respect for the perfectly lovely humans who work at Apple. Several are classmates from university, or people I had the pleasure of working with before at different companies. But I rather suspect what's happened here is that some project manager got a bit <em>too</em> enthusiastic about hitting their quarterly targets, cobbled together some shiny mockups, and somehow managed to convince Tim and the board that this was, in fact, a brilliant idea. And apparently at no point during this process did anyone think to raise their hand and gently suggest that perhaps—just perhaps—there exists such a thing as "too much glass."</p><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/tim.jpeg" alt="" width="1184" height="1571" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" srcset="https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/tim-xs.jpeg 300w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/tim-sm.jpeg 480w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/tim-md.jpeg 749w, https://blog.johnozbay.com/media/posts/6/responsive/tim-xl.jpeg 1200w"></figure></div></div></div>]]></description>

energy storage?” I’m your host, David Roberts. Redwood Materials started recycling lithium-ion batteries before it was cool, before it was profitable, and before there were very many lithium-ion batteries to speak of. In the five years since, it has grown and scaled to capture the overwhelming majority of the booming automotive-battery recycling market in North America.</p><p>Earlier this year, it spun off a new division called Redwood Energy. The idea is simple: it is going to hook the EV batteries it receives up to large arrays that serve as grid-scale energy storage. That way, it can drain every last bit of useful life out of them before it recycles them.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AnN-!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6116843-0cb4-4a46-a132-caaa72dea4c1_3916x2450.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AnN-!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6116843-0cb4-4a46-a132-caaa72dea4c1_3916x2450.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AnN-!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6116843-0cb4-4a46-a132-caaa72dea4c1_3916x2450.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AnN-!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6116843-0cb4-4a46-a132-caaa72dea4c1_3916x2450.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AnN-!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6116843-0cb4-4a46-a132-caaa72dea4c1_3916x2450.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AnN-!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6116843-0cb4-4a46-a132-caaa72dea4c1_3916x2450.jpeg" width="1456" height="911" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a6116843-0cb4-4a46-a132-caaa72dea4c1_3916x2450.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:911,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2107516,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Colin Campbell&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Colin Campbell&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.volts.wtf/i/174736218?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6116843-0cb4-4a46-a132-caaa72dea4c1_3916x2450.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="Colin Campbell" title="Colin Campbell" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AnN-!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6116843-0cb4-4a46-a132-caaa72dea4c1_3916x2450.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AnN-!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6116843-0cb4-4a46-a132-caaa72dea4c1_3916x2450.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AnN-!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6116843-0cb4-4a46-a132-caaa72dea4c1_3916x2450.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AnN-!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6116843-0cb4-4a46-a132-caaa72dea4c1_3916x2450.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Colin Campbell</figcaption></figure></div><p>So-called “second life” batteries have been discussed for many, many years, but this is the first time they have been deployed at appreciable scale.

Thank you so much for coming.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>David, thanks so much for having me. Pleasure to be here with you.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Before we jump in, let’s back up a little bit — I should have probably mentioned in the intro you are, in certain circles, semi-famous. Colin Campbell worked at Tesla for many, many years — 17 years — one of their lead engineers. So a big role in designing and growing Tesla. So maybe you could just say briefly what it is that pulled you over to this side of things?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Yeah, I was really excited when I joined Redwood to take some of the same philosophies and approaches and really, how should we say it, sort of the ethical impetus that brought me to Tesla and to deploy it in another part of the world. So instead of in consumer devices, cars, in industrial and industry, in things like the metals markets, novel material manufacturing at scale in the US. These are things that I think we all feel have withered a little bit over the last 20, 30 years in the US, and there’s a tremendous opportunity to apply some of the same lessons that we used at Tesla to those industries.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Was it 2019 that Redwood got underway?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Yes, that’s right.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>And when Redwood started, there were not that many EV batteries around. So you guys have been recycling all kinds. Basically just taking all lithium-ion batteries. Is that right?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Yeah. If you’ve got a lithium-ion battery, we will recycle it for you. So we’ll take your AirPods, your toothbrush, we’ll take that laptop, cell phone, all the way up to EVs.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>When did automotive batteries become the majority of your input by volume?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>That is a good question.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Was it recent or was that early on?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>I would say the transition to EV batteries dominating what we received, it’s been in the last year or 18 months.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>So the front edge of a very large wave of batteries has begun to arrive?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Yeah, the wave is out there, it’s coming. The waters have finally started to arrive at the beach here.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>So then comes this idea — and I have to think that someone at Redwood has had this idea in the back of their minds for a while — this idea of you’re getting all these batteries and then you’re just sucking the life out of them before you recycle them. It seems quite logical, but it raises all kinds of questions. So the very first question, I think the most important, because people have been discussing second life batteries for a long time, and always the barrier that keeps people away from it is batteries are very heterogeneous.</p><p>They come in. There are lots of different chemistries, there are lots of different wear and tear, states of wear and tear, how much life they have in them. You just get a huge variety of batteries. Making all those batteries work together has been the trick. And so when I heard this announcement from Redwood, I was like, “Oh my God, how’d they solve that problem?” And I went and looked and all it says on the site is, “Hey, we solved that problem.” So I’m very curious. Like, I thought that was an extremely difficult problem, but apparently you just hook all these different batteries up to this little box, this little box that you’re calling the universal translator, and voila, they all work together. So can you tell us a little bit about how you did that?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Simple as that. Yes. No, you’re absolutely right. And the idea of a second life battery in a second life energy storage system has been out there for a long time. I think you nailed one piece of it, which was that we weren’t really seeing those batteries come back for, originally, recycling, and now for second life in appreciable volume until really recently. We know it’s inevitable that they’ll come back, but it just hadn’t started to happen yet. And the other thing that’s made this practical — and more than practical, a good business for us — is a couple of realizations we had.</p><p>So one is that electric vehicle batteries are incredibly robust, and grid-scale energy storage is a relatively pastoral life for those batteries — it’s really like putting the old horse out to pasture. So what that means is you don’t have to do much to them. They’re mechanically made for salt spray and vibration and being underwater, and they’re electrically made for fast charging, for merging onto the freeway, for high performance.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>They’re very high-end.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Yes, exactly.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>I don’t know that people understand, one, how high end they are, or two, how big they are — capacity-wise, they’re huge. And then there’s three, sort of how big they are physically. I mean, one of the things that sort of haunted me as I was reading about this, and this is for years, when I think automotive battery, my brain wants to think about the size and shape of the normal —</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>12-volt lead-acid guy.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>12-volt battery, that square. And I was like, “Oh, those little square boxes. Well, those will be easy to stack.” But of course, an actual EV battery is this big, unwieldy, odd-shaped thing that is also heavy. You have to carry them around with forklifts.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Yep. So because they’re so awkward and big, if you’re going to repurpose them and have a profitable business doing that, you really can’t spend a bunch of labor on it. So the important thing for us was, don’t disassemble it, don’t mess with it, really use it as it is.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>That’s key here. You’re not getting at the cells, you’re not tearing it down and using the cells, you’re just — it’s just the battery itself. You’re just plugging the battery itself, laying it on the ground and plugging it in.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Yeah, there’s a little bit more magic to that, but that’s the core of it — do as little as possible, make it really, really simple to keep it cheap and resilient and flexible for the, what you said, the wide variety of packs that we get.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>And we should say another barrier to making this business work was the incredible logistics involved in gathering batteries, which, of course, you guys are already doing.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Yeah, it’s an underappreciated challenge of the recycling business, which is just gathering all the batteries. It’s an incredibly diverse and heterogeneous set of companies, set of individuals, set of utilities, and municipal agencies that collect them. And our commercial team has just crushed it, really, in making it so that all those batteries come to us.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>What’s the percentage now?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>It’s north of 70 or 80%.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>So is that 80% of the batteries that get recycled or do you think it’s 80% of all lithium-ion car batteries?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>It is of the lithium-ion batteries. So more than just car batteries that get recycled in the US.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>So you’re the bulk of the recycling business. But you didn’t actually answer the core of the question, which is — I mean, I’m sure the actual answer is some sort of software gobbledygook that I wouldn’t understand — but what is it that made it possible for you, you guys, to figure this software out when other people have failed?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Yeah. So there are two parts, like we said: One is this mechanical simplicity and the other is what you referred to earlier, this box that we’re calling a universal translator. So what is that? That is something that our really strong in-house power electronics team built. It is a way to make sure every one of these unique snowflakes of a pack gets individual care and feeding. So it’s a way to control the voltage, control the power for each pack, depending on its own unique state of health, its own unique state of charge. Also to talk the language of any pack.</p><p>So if you’ve got 50 different pack manufacturers, they all talk 50 different languages, the content is kind of similar —</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>I was curious about that, are you sort of able to generalize at all or are you really sort of having, “Well, here’s NMC language. We got to program that in.” Is there any sort of commonality among batteries or is it really just bespoke, you got to program every single individual one in there?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>It’s pretty bespoke. The content is the same. All battery packs want to talk about is cell voltages, cell temperatures, and pack currents. But the languages are pretty different.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Interesting.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>So that’s been a real effort and a real successful effort by our software team to abstract that away and make it so that at the high level we just have a battery.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>So I’m curious just how agnostic it is. Can you say with confidence that any EV battery on the market, if you wear it out in your car, you can plug it into this thing? Is that categorical?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>It’s never, never 100%. But we’ve put a lot of effort into making sure we’re in the high 90s. So this universal translator that we built, it’s ready for battery packs anywhere from 200 to 900 volts, for example. So we know more modern cars are higher voltage, semi trucks are higher voltage, Cybertrucks are higher voltage. And then also we’re agnostic to chemistry, so LFP, high nickel, we can take it all.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>That is just wild. So congrats to your software team. It actually raises the question, which is, I’m wondering, like, how modular is this? It seems like the box, the software is the key thing. So if I, for whatever reason, had one of these boxes and I’m like, I don’t know, I run an automotive garage or something and I just happen to have three or four spare EV batteries in my backyard, could I hook them together and treat them like one battery, just using this thing? Like how, how small can it get, I guess is the question?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Yeah, you hypothetically could. I’d never thought about it, to be honest. But there’s no reason you couldn’t make a 200 kilowatt-hour site using this same piece of technology.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>So it’ll scale down as far as you would ever want?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>It will. I’ll say that’s not the question we most commonly get. Usually people want to know how big can you go and how fast can you go?</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, we’ll get there. But you know, I love me some distributed energy, so I’d love to think about who could do this on site, basically. So you get the batteries and you assess them presumably to see if they’re suitable for this. Sort of like, what’s the criteria and how many batteries make it through?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Yeah, the assessment, I think it’s less of an intense torture test than most people imagine. And the reason for that is you don’t need that much cycle life out of a used battery in order for it to make economic sense to put it into service. So you don’t really need perfect understanding of its state of health. You just need to know it’s good enough. And so that’s something — we’ve built some specialized hardware to do that. It’s less than a minute per battery.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Oh, so you get it, you plug it in, you get a thumbs-up or thumbs-down.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Red light, green light.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>And how many batteries get sort of rejected versus accepted, do you know?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>We do know. I’ll have to say we’re constitutionally sort of incapable of rejecting things. So first pass, it’s high 90s that we’re accepting.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Ah, so most batteries then will have some juice left.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Most batteries are good enough, and that doesn’t mean they’re great, but they’re really good enough to deploy. And then we’re always looking at that fraction that got rejected and just saying, “How can we squeeze a little bit more utility out of those?”</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Maybe this comparison you don’t have in the top of your head, but relatively speaking, for a given battery, say an NMC battery, what is the value of this remaining capacity you’re getting out of them versus the value of the metals that you recover out of them?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Yeah, well, obviously it varies and we’re learning, but equal to or greater and maybe several times greater.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Oh, interesting. So this is not a marginal bit of value creation. Then you’re getting, you’re 2x-ing the value you get out of these batteries by doing this?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Something like that. Which is like, “Oh my goodness, look at this utility that we were rushing into the recycler. Let’s go and take a detour and capture it.”</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Right, right. So tell me just a little bit about, from an engineering perspective, how you design a system when you know that these batteries, let’s say relative to a typical grid-scale battery installation, you’re going to be mucking with these a lot more. You’re going to be adding them and removing them more frequently than a typical battery installation. How do you design around that to try to keep that cost — because I’ll just say up front, like when I first heard about this, and I’m sure a lot of people say this, like my first thought is just like, “That just sounds like a lot of logistics, like a lot of people, a lot of forklifts, a lot of space, just a lot of logistics.”</p><p>So it must be clear to you that you’re getting more value out of it than the logistics. But how are you trying to minimize the logistics of being this active — taking things in and out?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Yeah, well, the short answer, and maybe not that helpful, is you design for it. So you know that you’re going to have to swap packs more often than in a brand new energy storage site with new cells. And so you provision for that in your design. So, yeah, there’s some small amount of forklift traffic. You make sure it’s really simple to access packs, that it’s really simple for an operator to connect and disconnect packs, to lift them, to move them. And I think one piece of this that is related to that is that these sites are slightly lower energy density than maybe a brand new purpose-built energy storage site. And that really eases service.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>How do you mean? Like, what do you mean safety-wise?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>No, no, just in terms of the megawatt-hours per acre. They’re a little more spread out, and part of that is service and planning for service.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>So you just have to literally physically lay them on the ground. You have to space them out enough that you can get to them, basically?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Yeah, it’s actually — I think of it less as a requirement of second life energy storage and it’s more one about like what is the value of a really dense energy storage site? For some sites it’s really important: if you’re in a city, if you’re close to some infrastructure where land is expensive, it’s really important. But in many, many sites it’s less important and you would actually get a lower cost dollars per kilowatt-hour installed with less energy density. And that was one important realization.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Because of lower labor costs, because of easier — it’s just easier to use, easier to update.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Just simpler. The closer you pack cells together, the more careful you have to be because they do contain energy.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Well, let’s talk about safety then. Because I was going to get to that later, but I’m assuming that, like, because these are spaced out so widely and they’re just sort of individually attached, it’s kind of difficult for me to imagine any sort of large-scale fire or any danger really. Is there safety? What is the, what are the safety considerations here?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>So top of the list for us, of course, designing this thing is safety. And our guiding light has always been passive safety. So if you do have a fire for whatever reason, that it stops on its own, that no fire response is needed, no sprinklers are needed, you’re absolutely welcome to. We encourage people to do that, but it’s not necessary. So it’s a passive feature of the system.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>So this individual battery that’s hooked up could theoretically catch on fire, burn up, and be done — and that’s it. And who cares, basically.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>That’s exactly right.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Has that happened? Have you had any thermal runaways yet? I’m always curious what the actual percentage of that happening is.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>No, we haven’t. It’s really rare. I mean, it’s impactful and it’s important when it does. And I think Moss Landing in particular really sticks in everyone’s imagination.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>It really does. That’s why I have to ask this question anytime I talk to a battery company.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Yeah. And that’s real. That was a real — that was a bad outcome. But we are designed to avoid anything like that.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>How long have you had enough batteries come through yet that you’re able to generalize about kind of what you’re getting out of them? Like, what is the average lifespan of one of these?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Yeah, we really don’t know, to be frank. But what we do know is that it’s long enough to be a good business, that if we deploy them for a year, for 500 cycles, something like that, that makes sense. And we know that that’s well within reach.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>But presumably this little box is recording lots of information about these. So you are gathering tons of data, presumably tons of data about the performance of these used batteries?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Yeah, absolutely. I think we’re going to be the clearinghouse for what actually happens at the end of life for EV packs. But it takes a long time. They’re pretty robust. So even after you have rightfully retired one from your car for being slow and having a short range, there are many, many, many years of capacity remaining at that thing.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>80% is like the typical industry — that’s where you sort of cut off the EV battery usefulness. When it gets down to 80%?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Yeah, that’s a norm. Depends on the customer. It’s really their choice.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Sure, but 80% is a lot.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Exactly.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>You sort of already answered this, but I’ll ask it anyway: So right now you’re going to places where land is not at a particular premium. And so there’s no real reason not to spread out, as you say. You might even get a little better unit economics spreading out more. I wonder, do you expect all future second life grid-scale storage to be in places where land is not a premium? Because what I’m wondering is, are there engineering ways to get them closer together? Could you ever figure out how to stack them? Like, they are very spread out.</p><p>And like the first thing that came to mind was, if this becomes really valuable and really common, somebody is going to figure out how to squish them closer together. Is that something you think about at all?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>We do think about it and we in fact have already done it. So our architecture is flexible, so we really work with our customer to understand the value of density to them. And if it’s high, then we can provide a much denser product.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>You can do it. Is there stacking? Can you stack them at all? Go vertical at all? Because this is the thing, they just spread out horizontally. And I can’t help thinking, if you could just go up a couple of stories, you could fit so much more.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Yeah. There are a bunch of different ways to do it, and it just starts to get a little more complicated. You’ve got to build the tower for them to live in and figure out how to get them in and out. It’s all possible. It all makes sense in certain circumstances, but not all. So we work with the people who are buying these to figure out what makes sense.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Is the idea here that you will be the developer and the owner of the battery in all cases, or are you selling, will someone else own and operate them? What’s the business model exactly?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>I mean, this industry, there’s probably every business model under the sun available, and we’re open to pretty much all of them. The one thing that is important to us is that we recycle the packs. That’s part of our mission. It’s part of what we think is important to do in North America, and we intend to do that.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>But that sort of suggests that the model that makes the most sense is for you to just be sort of having them and owning them and running them the whole time. Or is the idea that you could ship a bunch of these to a separate site, they set up one of these, and then they ship them back to your facility when they’re done with them, but they own them while they’re in the battery?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>There’s — I’m not trying to be cute — you could imagine a million different ways to structure that sort of contractual relationship. And in the end, the batteries, we still would like to receive them for recycling.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>I guess it’s more like the physics or logistics of it. I’m sort of wondering about. Because doing this right next to the plant where they’re recycled makes just a ton of sense. Obviously, there’s very little logistics, but once you have one of these set up in a spot that is remote from the recycling facility, then the fact that packs are coming in and out frequently becomes a little bit more of an issue. Because then you have a sort of a supply chain between you and a remote facility. That doesn’t daunt you at all?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>You have to think about it. But this is not like rail cars and rail cars of packs going back and forth, even from a giant energy storage site. It’s like a few. And at the beginning, while we are really pioneering this and doing it for the first time — I think it makes total sense for us to do it ourselves. And we will. But I don’t think that’s necessary long term.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>So one of the claims your CEO J. B. Straubel makes in his sort of introductory video is that this is going to be cheaper than grid-scale storage with new lithium-ion batteries. And I guess the calculation there is — on one hand, your business model works as is. So you have the batteries from the perspective of this new division basically for free. Like they’re already there. You’re already gathering them. So in a sense, even if they’re lower quality than new batteries, they’re just sitting there. So, in a sense they’re cheaper that way.</p><p>But on the other hand, you have all this logistics, you have all these forklifts and trucks and setting up and the space and site and everything else. So I’m just wondering how the costs balance out. Is there an easy comparison between a new second life battery and a brand new battery? Like a cost comparison?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Yeah, I think as you pointed out, the cost of energy is low compared to a brand new battery because it’s degraded, it’s been out in the world, it’s not a fresh battery. The balance of system, we’re actually making really important strides there too. So the power electronics, the mechanical assembly, there’s a lot of cost in these sites around what people call the EPC cost — engineering, procurement, construction — civil works, getting the batteries plugged in, wiring the whole thing up. And we spent and are spending a lot of time optimizing sort of the rest of the cost stack.</p><p>So not just leaning on the fact that our energy is relatively low cost because it is second life energy, but really pushing hard on power electronics. We have that whole team in-house. Push down the dollars per watt of power electronics, make it a really, really simple, really, really robust thing to deploy. And that’s underappreciated about what we’re up to — it’s not just that the batteries are cheaper, the whole system is simpler.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Well, that’s, I mean, it’s the whole system that first jumped up when I started reading about this. Like obviously that’s where, like, you found an incredibly cheap source of batteries, i.e. a big pile of batteries you already had in your backyard. But like, it’s all, all the costs are the logistics and the balance of system stuff. So you think you have running room there to bring those costs down substantially?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Absolutely.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>But you can claim that you are beating a new lithium-ion grid-scale battery storage system on the sort of per kilowatt-hour basis already?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Yes, we can, and that’s installed over life. So there’s a little bit of pack replacement that has to happen.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Do you have a number? What are you pitching to people when you’re trying to sell this?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>I do have a number, but it’s enough to make it a really good, great business, I think, is what I will say here.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Okay, but like, sort of legendarily, a new lithium-ion battery grid-scale storage — they sort of will do four hours, some of them will do eight hours. Some people now are pushing the economics because batteries are getting cheaper. They’re pushing the economics out to maybe 12 hours at the outer edge. If your unit costs are that much cheaper, how — what kind of durations do you think you can get given your cheaper system?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>You’ve actually nailed it there. So because energy is cheaper, the balance of plant, which we are making great progress on, like power electronics, the cost of power starts to become more important. And so we have a real advantage for eight-hour and beyond energy storage. We can play and compete and win at 2-hour and 4-hour on total installed cost over life. But it starts to look really compelling at the longer durations.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Oh, interesting. Can you do 24 hours? The Holy Grail. Could you make something baseload out of this?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Absolutely. The original modeling that we did for this was around a 24-hour system. Turning renewables into baseload. Looks really good.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>I’ve been told by many very confident-sounding people, Colin, that that’s impossible. So you say you did it. So do you envision the next plant you build and the next one after that — do you envision hooking these up to the grid and having them sort of make money off providing services to the grid, arbitrage, frequency, et cetera, et cetera? Or do you primarily envision doing what you’ve done with this first installation, which is going off-grid? You got solar panels, you got batteries, you got data centers. It’s all hooked up together, it’s all self-contained and running on its own, and does not need one of these very difficult-to-get grid connections.</p><p>Which model do you think is going to dominate?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>We are going to do all of the above. We can and we are doing sites for grid services. Just plug a battery into the grid and help support the grid by participating in the market. We have other “microgrids.” They’re not so micro anymore. They’re many, many, many megawatts.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Go ahead and brag. This one you built? Yeah, it’s Nevada. I forget — it’s the biggest microgrid in America? You are claiming North America.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>It’s the largest microgrid in North America and it’s the largest second-energy storage site in the world. So that’s like you said at the top, it’s a 12-megawatt AC, 63-megawatt-hour grid supporting about 2 or 3 megawatts of data centers and run by solar. So all the energy comes from another 12 megawatts of solar.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>And the grid does not touch it. There’s no transmission grid connection at all?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>That’s exactly right.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>What a beautiful thing. I’ve also been confidently told that those things don’t work economically. Exciting that it is working. And you’ve probably answered this already. But in terms of grid services, you hook one of these things up to the grid, there’s nothing that new batteries can do that these batteries can’t do, right? In terms of frequency regulation and all this kind of stuff. Grid forming, whatever. The kind of things that the batteries and inverters can do.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Virtual inertia, all of that. I mean, one of the things that is very topical right now is the data center market, of course, like a giant increase in the demand for power.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Indeed.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>And there’s just this beautiful symbiosis between energy storage and data centers. Sort of no matter what your primary source of power is. So much of it is the, there’s already huge racks of batteries and uninterruptible power supplies inside the data center. Already these big diesel generators. We can make both of those things obsolete.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>So you now have two little data centers running. I mean, the data center company technology that you’re using at this site is also pretty interesting on its own merits. But they’re building basically what they call modular data centers. And I’ve been wondering when someone’s going to do this because everybody, it’s kind of the same arc nuclear went on at first. Everybody’s like economies of scale. Economies of scale. Bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, big, big, big. And you’re getting these data centers now that are like small cities, like gigawatt-plus data centers. And I have part of this podcast premise to hunt great faith in modularity and repeatability and manufacturability competing against those economies of scale.</p><p>So this company is making data centers at this site in Nevada, is making these basically like containerized, modularized data centers. Like a 1-megawatt data center with all the power, electronics, cooling, etc., contained in the box, basically.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>That’s our partner Crusoe, we love them, they’re super smart and they’re doing exactly what you’re talking about, which is: how do we drive down the cost of a data center? We mass-manufacture it.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Mass manufacture and distribute so it’ll be distributed just like everything else. And then you can wedge a little bit of data centering here and a little bit of data centering there rather than having to look for a mega site. But anyway, that’s probably a whole separate pod on its own. But yeah, but again, so there’s — so you could, in terms of building these sort of like off-grid, self-contained solar plus battery plus use — whoever’s in that use, that could be any manufacturing, be a factory, be anything?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Could be anyone who needs power. So data center is obviously top of the list right now. You can go set up a data center quite quickly and run it off solar and storage while you wait for your grid interconnection. If you’re planning to put a natural gas turbine, while you wait for that turbine to show up, those are actually — can be at the power levels we’re talking about, they can take a long time.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Yes.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>So we can help sort of blaze the trail. And then there’s really a tremendous amount of utility and, like I said, symbiosis between data centers and energy storage.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Well, just speed too, right? Like the top — you know this — the top thing hyperscalers are saying, the top thing data centers want is speed to market. They hardly care about the cost, they just want to get hooked up, time to power. And I’m guessing, tell me if I’m wrong, but I’m guessing you can build one of these things, a solar field and a battery field attached to a manufacturing facility, faster than any large-scale centralized power plant. Is that —</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>That is turning out to be true.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>How fast? Do you have a number yet? You’ve only built one.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>I mean it obviously depends so much on scale, but 12 months, 18 months.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>How long did it take to build the one you built?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>I mean, the one we built from empty dirt pad to fully commissioned was like four months.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>What?! A four-month timeline for a fully operational 24/7 power supply.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>This is where the simplicity of install is so important.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Yeah, so again, you’re pushing away at that, the balance of system, the speed, etc. But again, already four months is just wildly faster than anything else available. Have you learned anything — I mean, this thing, this one you’ve got running has only been running for two, three months. It’s relatively new, so I’m sure there’s lots more to learn. But have you learned anything about the performance of these things in the field? Like, are you getting data that is updating any of your priors? Is anything surprising you about what’s actually happening out there?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>So far, no surprises. So we’re confirming a lot of the things that we had modeled out. We have a really excellent physics-based modeling team. So I’ll give you one example. A lot of EV batteries are liquid cooled. So if you are driving around in your electric car, your cells are cooled by fluid that runs through a radiator. And we don’t use that system because of the complexity that’s associated with pumps and pipes and fluids and all of those things. And we now know for a fact that that is absolutely fine in the middle of the desert in the summer.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>So most of the overheating probably comes from being contained in a hot car over hot pavement. In that environment, they just won’t overheat if you’re sitting them out in the open.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>It’s really about the rate that we are pushing power into them.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Oh, I see.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>So if we’re discharging, say at the fastest, over two hours, that’s pretty chill for a battery compared to showing up at a supercharger and trying to fill it in 20 minutes.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Again, this is out to pasture again. These are old horses that are being treated gently.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>So it’s working exactly as we expected it to.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>And you’re not worried at all that in the fullness of time, because batteries, new batteries are legendarily rapidly falling in cost, you’re not worried at all that at some point that process is going to undercut your economics. Do you think you’re going to stay ahead of that?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Yeah, well, I think a used battery is always going to be cheaper than a new one. I’m pretty confident in that. And the other piece of it is what I talked about a little bit earlier. We’re not sitting still on the non-battery parts. So we’re really, we have a great team, power electronics, mechanical engineering, software, all of that pushing down the cost of all the things that aren’t the battery.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Is there a future where you include other kinds of non-automotive batteries in this system? Like, is there another kind of battery that has enough juice in it to make it worth the squeeze?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>I think so. I mean, we’re pretty agnostic to battery type. So it really comes down to sort of acquisition cost, in the end.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>I’m just sort of assuming that like a toothbrush battery is just not going to be worth getting the human to walk out there and plug it in.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Let me backpedal. I don’t think ever that you’ll see like a matrix-like field of AirPods or toothbrushes.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>So what’s the general cutoff? Like a weed whacker battery, like how big before...?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>I don’t know, but I bet somewhere in the like 10 to 14 kilowatt-hour range, somewhere in there it’ll start to make sense. So maybe light hybrids, but not weed whackers.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>And not toothbrushes. So in terms of the logistics of gathering the batteries, I’m assuming that’s all already up and running. That’s what you’ve been doing for the last few years. Is your ability to do this with the batteries going to change that side of things — how you gather them? I know there’s some sort of partnership with GM, it’s a little vague on the website, exactly what that consists of. What is that?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Well, I think we’ve really put more effort into exactly those kinds of partnerships with automakers who sometimes have the packs at their end of life and need a place to send them.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Do they, though? Why would they, like, why would GM end up with used GM batteries?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Well, sometimes. So some, some packs —</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>I’m so curious, what happens to a battery — like if my battery runs out, I go to a — I don’t know, a mechanic or whatever and get a new one. I have no idea what happens to it. Tell us just a little bit about what that looks like?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Everything under the sun happens to it. So if it’s a dealer, then that’s one, like, pretty consistent path. If it’s a shop, your local EV service shop, it’s actually been a challenge for them. And it’s one thing that, well before this energy storage business started, that we’ve been working hard to make as easy as possible. So we actually have sort of a — I don’t know what you want to call it, like a reverse Amazon — to make it super easy to send big batteries like this to us to figure out what they’re worth and get them on their way.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>So they mail them to you, basically, they ship them to you.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Yes.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Interesting. And that — I don’t know, that just seems so expensive when I think about it. Again, so much logistics. It’s amazing how much logistics is involved in your business model.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Logistics is a real thing. It’s also remarkable how efficient it is to move mass around. Transportation costs for a battery are not a giant piece of the concern. It’s really the complexity of just like there’s a million places these end up — junkyards, people’s houses, dealerships, everything you can imagine.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>What is the GM partnership, the newer GM partnership? It caught my eye, and the reason I ask about it is because I thought it would just be them getting you their old batteries. But it also says something in the press release about them maybe sending you new batteries also to be included in these power plants. So I was wondering about that — if there would ever be any reason for new batteries to wander into this milieu.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Yeah, well, maybe a couple things. GM’s been tremendously collaborative with us as we embark on the second life project. And we appreciate that. It’s very helpful to have their support as we do it. And then not specific to GM, but you do have to ask yourself the question “Why do these batteries have to be used?” And if we can do a good enough job on the balance of system costs, then they don’t. That’s not our focus right now, but it’s something that definitely is on my mind.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Interesting. So theoretically, you could end up being just a very competitive grid storage company that is agnostic to the source of batteries?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Could be.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Someday, maybe.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>The thing that we’re getting good at right now, and it’s still — it’s still early days, I want to emphasize that for us — is being uniquely capable of integrating all of these zillion different battery types. So this, like, heterogeneity is something that we’re really good at.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Which raises a question I’ve had about Redwood forever. Recycling really forever. Now that you are big enough to sort of throw your weight around a little bit, you’re a big player in this market. Have you initiated any kind of talks with battery designers and manufacturers about trying to get batteries to be designed more for recyclability on the front end? And now that I think about it too, that would probably — like, the more sort of uniform they get and the easier to recycle it gets, I feel like that would also have the effect of making them easier to do this with, to integrate into these things with. Are you at all trying to influence the design of batteries on the front end?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>That’s a great question. And I confronted that a little bit in my prior life where I was designing EV battery packs.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>I think Tesla’s actually famous for designing batteries that are very not that. They’re very integrated into the car. They’re very — not particularly recyclable.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>I’ll say a couple things about that. One is, when you’re doing things the way that we need to do them to make an impact in the world at industrial scale, having packs be disassembled by hand or even with automation, the sort of design for recyclability, that’s pretty expensive. And so I think the recycling processes that win are going to be something that is at least philosophically like backing up a truck full of packs and like dumping them into a machine.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Are you physically disassembling all the batteries now? Before you recycle them in the recycling process.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Right now I try not to. I try to send them into energy storage.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>You hire people to do that.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>But no, our processes don’t require a great deal of disassembly because every pack is different, and I think every pack is rightfully different in order to make a great car or a great truck or whatever it is, it’s hard to make those things.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>So you think standardization is going to happen on the recycling end, not on the design end, basically?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>I think so. And I think the processes for separating out all of the metals that are contained in a pack are going to work fine, regardless of how the pack was built.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Yeah, yeah, I need to do another pod just on the recycling stuff. By way of wrapping up, let’s look out a little bit into the future. When I brought this up online, a lot of people’s first reaction was, “Well, that seems like kind of a boutique distraction from the core business that Redwood’s in.” And the more I looked into it, I was like, “Well, there’s like two gazillion batteries on the way to recycling.” Again, we’re just at the front end of this. They’re just sort of trickling in now, I guess you’d say, in what is going to become a flood.</p><p>So you could see this growing and expanding quite a bit. I just wonder how you see this division relative to the recycling division. I mean, you sort of touched on this earlier. Do you think this will be, in the fullness of time, a comparably sized part of the business or even bigger than the recycling part?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Absolutely. There’s plenty of batteries out there in the world that are going to need to be reused. Like you — you hit on it. It’s like, what is North American EV pack production per year today? It’s 100 gigawatt-hours, 150 gigawatt-hours per year. And then the entire storage, I think, deployed last year in the US was — was half of that. So, the EV market is, for the moment, quite big compared to the storage market. They’re both growing, but —</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>EVs are growing faster. I mean, I’m assuming EVs are always going to dwarf stationary storage.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Storage is catching up. I think it’s about a quarter of the cells in the US that go into storage.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Really? That’s bigger than I would have guessed.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>But the point is there’s plenty of used packs. We know that it’s inevitable they’re going to come back. So that’s to the like, is it a boutique distraction? No, I think it’s a real durable business. And to the question, is it a distraction? We are still quite committed to the metals business. I think that’s still so exciting and so important to bring back to North America.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>And this does seem like, to me at least, this seems just to fit right in. Like in a sense, it’s almost like a version of recycling. You’re sort of recycling power. You’re recycling the power before you recycle the metals.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>I was trying to think about how to say this.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>But in the same way, you’re preventing new stuff from having to be made. I mean, in a sense, in both cases, you’re preventing the necessity for new stuff.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Yeah, I mean, the need for new stuff is gigantic. And so in order to fuel a complete electrification of the economy, there’s still a lot of new stuff we’re going to need, but we can in the short term blunt that a little bit and make it cheaper by extracting really every last drop of utility, whether it be energy storage capacity, whether it be the metals out of old things. And then if you fast forward 100 years, like it’ll all be circular.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>So this is, especially in these depressing current times. These are among, among the places I go, my happy places is thinking about this 100-year time horizon and total circularity. And it’s interesting to think how this fits into that picture, basically. You can imagine a world of full circularity vis-à-vis metals, right, where we no longer are having to dig up any new metals, basically. We’ve reached a steady state. We’re perfectly recycling all the metals that come through.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>You can. The thing I want to emphasize is that that also just makes economic sense. It is a cheaper way to provide nickel and lithium in addition to being sort of lower carbon and all of the other things that circularity provides.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Yes. Less grim labor implications, all that kind of stuff as well. But I was sort of thinking about how this fits into that. Like if you’re getting all the world’s batteries and recycling them and you’re sucking all this capacity out of them before you recycle them, you’re also like, that’s a big, potentially a big chunk of the energy storage we need. I don’t know if anybody’s tried to do this kind of math, like 20 years out or whatever, 50 years out. Like what, what sort of — like how much of the stationary storage market in the US do you think could ultimately be served by second life batteries?</p><p>This is all napkin math, of course.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>It’s a good question. So today we can serve like 10, 15% of the market.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Really? Already with the batteries you’re receiving today?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Yeah, so we’re receiving something like 5 gigawatt-hours a year. And I think the US put 50 into service this year.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>5 gigawatt-hours a year. And this plant you built, we should say, this off-grid plant, it’s like 63, not, it’s not even 100 megawatt-hours. So to really scale this up to start matching the input, that’s just going to be a lot of land, isn’t it? You’re not worried at all about the land?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>I mean, this is like, this is a version of “Am I worried about the land use of solar?” And no, turns out you get a lot of, a lot of energy density coming from the sun. A lot of power density, sorry. And if you look at the size of — we can even look at our pilot plant in Nevada. If you look at the size of the battery compared to the size of the solar array, it’s 1/10 the size.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>1/10?!</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>So, and that’s, we could do better. We could do 1/20 or 1/30 if we wanted to.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Ah, so you can shrink down the size of the battery thing. Can’t really shrink down the size of the solar.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Yeah, exactly. So, it’s not that big.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>So for the off-grid applications, it would be the generation. That would be the land, the real land issue, not so much the batteries. What’s next? We pull our view out from 100 years out to say five. What’s next? What’s the next plant? Do you imagine being sort of the owner and developer of the next few of these as you kind of prove them out and show they can work?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>What’s next is much bigger projects. So we have several of those lined up already in the 5 to 10 and bigger x the one we put in Nevada. So substantially bigger than our pilot site in Nevada. And so we’re really focused on executing those and delivering those.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>And are those in Nevada?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>They’re all over the country.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Really? I think of the vast west desert as where you find these big swaths of cheap land. Are you building — you have your eye on the east coast, the northeast, congested areas too?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>We have projects — I’m sort of like doing the Rolodex in my head here — not quite everywhere in the country, but not just in the desert west, to your point.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Interesting. And I’m sure some of this is confidential, but for the projects in your pipeline, are they all off-grid, attached to solar in some sort of manufacturing facility, or are some of them going to be grid-connected?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Some of them will be grid connected. Like if you can imagine a place where somebody has put a utility-scale battery, we have a project like that. We have grid-connected grid arbitrage. We have behind the meter, front of the meter. We have paired with manufacturing, paired with renewables.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Any energy storage plays, basically.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Exactly. Same energy storage as any other kind.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>As I think about the logistics, new things keep coming to mind. But in terms of your battery gathering, how many sites do you have where you’re gathering batteries? Because wherever you build one of these, you are establishing basically an ongoing relationship to some source of these batteries, right? A supply chain. You’re going to have to have batteries continually shipped between where they’re gathered and where you have this plant. How many of those battery gathering sites are there?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>As this becomes a national project for us, we need sort of regional warehousing.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Is it all in the one Nevada plant at this point?</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>It’s not. We also have a big site that we’re developing and actually just opened our first recycling plant there in South Carolina. So that’s a strategic spot for us on the east coast, near a port, near a lot of industry. And that’s another logical place for us to inventory this stuff. But I imagine, in the fullness of time, we will put them where it makes sense to support these customers.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>I just keep trying to wrap my head around the shift that you are about to undergo. Like right now you say you got 5 gigawatt-hours a year of batteries incoming.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Gigawatt-hours.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Yep, gigawatt-hours, sorry. I’m assuming that the line is going up and to the right.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Yes, it is.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>How fast per year? Like, what’s next year? How steep is that line? I mean, I’m assuming it’s just going to get real steep relatively soon. But I don’t know if you’ve actually charted it out and plotted it out.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Yeah, it’s a little hard to predict, but we’ve seen 50% year-on-year growth at the beginning of this wave. And you can look back at the beginning of EV manufacturing in 2012 in volume. What was the ramp rate? And we’re going to see something like that.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Interesting. So we’re going to go from like 5, 10. Like having 100 GWh of batteries coming through is not crazy. Not out of the...</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Yeah, I mean, you can almost just predict it. We’re making 100 gigawatt-hours today, so in 10 years we’ll be seeing those come back ready for second life.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>And so then I just, at that level of volume, getting more power out of them will in no way be a small thing. I think this is what J. B. Straubel was kind of trying to get at in his big talk — this may look like a side thing today, but it’s going to be enormously important. If you’ve got 100 gigawatt-hours coming through, that’s a lot of power to just be throwing away. So it’s just going to be a lot more significant in five years.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>It really will. So we are laying the groundwork for this. This team knows how to build things at scale. We have done it before. The business and the power electronics, the mechanical bits that we’re designing for energy storage, they’re all designed for mass manufacture, for simple assembly in the field. Because we know that this is coming — tens and hundreds of gigawatts.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Well, I love to see someone getting ahead of the puck. As I look around these days at US politics, it’s nice to see someone anticipating what’s going to happen and getting ready before it happens. Just a beautiful thing to witness.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>Thank you. We’re having fun. We love finding something valuable that hasn’t been extracted and going after it. And this is just another example of it.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Yeah, it’s just a bunch of puzzles. I mean, all this second life stuff is just an enormous logistical puzzle to solve. And solving puzzles is fun.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>We really enjoy it.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Colin, thanks so much for coming on and talking us through this. Really interesting. I think it’s a lot bigger of a deal than it sort of appears on the surface. So it was fun to — fun to dig in a little bit with you. Thanks for coming on.</p><p><strong>Colin Campbell</strong></p><p>So fun to be here. Great questions. Really enjoyed it.</p><p><strong>David Roberts</strong></p><p>Thank you for listening to Volts.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-1">
<p>Concerns over <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tag/ai/">AI</a> surveillance in schools are intensifying after armed officers swarmed a 16-year-old student outside Kenwood High School in Baltimore when an AI gun detection system falsely flagged a Doritos bag as a firearm.</p>



<p>Taki Allen was hanging out with friends after football practice on October 20 when multiple police cars suddenly pulled up.</p>



<p>“It was like eight cop cars that came pulling up for us,” Allen told <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.wbaltv.com/article/student-handcuffed-ai-system-mistook-bag-chips-weapon/69114601">WBAL-TV 11 News</a>. “They started walking toward me with guns, talking about ‘Get on the ground,’ and I was like, ‘What?’”</p>



<p>“They made me get on my knees, put my hands behind my back, and cuff me. Then they searched me and found nothing,” he said.</p>



<p>Allen was handcuffed at gunpoint. Police later showed him the AI-captured image that triggered the alert. The crumpled Doritos bag in his pocket had been mistaken for a gun.</p>



<p>“It was mainly like, am I gonna die? Are they going to kill me? “They showed me the picture, said that looks like a gun, I said, ‘no, it’s chips.’”</p>

<h2 id="h-student-afraid-to-return-to-school-after-ai-sends-police-after-him">Student afraid to return to school after AI sends police after him</h2>



<p>The AI system behind the incident is part of <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://www.omnilert.com/solution-brochures/omnilert-gun-detection-system">Omnilert’s gun detection technology</a>, introduced in Baltimore County Public Schools last year. It scans existing surveillance footage and alerts police in real time when it detects what it believes to be a weapon.</p>



<p>Omnilert later admitted the incident was a “false positive” but claimed the system “functioned as intended,” saying its purpose is to “prioritize safety and awareness through rapid human verification.”</p>



<p>Baltimore County Public Schools echoed the company’s statement in a letter to parents, offering counseling services to students impacted by the incident.</p><div id="article-note"><h2>Related</h2></div>

<p>“We understand how upsetting this was for the individual that was searched as well as the other students who witnessed the incident,” the principal wrote. “Our counselors will provide direct support to the students who were involved.”</p>



<p>Allen says no one from the school has reached out to him personally.</p>



<p>“They didn’t apologize. They just told me it was protocol,” he <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href="https://foxbaltimore.com/news/local/teen-detained-after-ai-system-mistakes-chips-for-weapon-outside-kenwood-high-school">said</a>. “I was expecting at least somebody to talk to me about it.”</p>



<p>The teen now says he no longer feels safe going to school.</p>



<p>“If I eat another bag of chips or drink something, I feel like they’re going to come again,” Allen said.</p>



<p>The case has sparked fresh debate over the reliability of AI surveillance tools and their real-world consequences, especially in schools.</p>



<p>This incident comes as more institutions implement AI technology. Earlier this month, Major General William ‘Hank’ Taylor, one of the top officers in the US Army, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/us-army-general-admits-using-ai-for-military-decisions-and-is-really-close-with-chatgpt-3270391/">admitted to using ChatGPT</a> to make key military decisions.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the UK introduced strict age verification measures for mature content, requiring users to pass a facial scan to prove they’re over 18. This has left some adults unable to access content, such as Britain’s most tattooed man, who said the age check system <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/britains-most-tattooed-man-says-uks-age-check-system-told-him-to-remove-his-face-3232920/">told him to “remove his face”</a> because it interpreted his tattoos as a mask.</p>

Our <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/expanding-flood-forecasting-coverage-helping-partners/">flood forecasting</a> information — now covering more than two billion people — provides life-saving forecasts before the most significant river floods. It's helped organizations like World Vision get drinking water and food to communities when they need it most. And during the devastating 2025 California wildfires, we provided crisis alerts with information from local authorities to 15 million people across Los Angeles while showing them where to find shelter in Google Maps. This is all made possible by our geospatial AI models, not only for <a href="https://research.google/blog/using-ai-to-expand-global-access-to-reliable-flood-forecasts/">floods</a> and <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/google-wildfire-boundary-maps-europe-africa/">wildfires</a>, but <a href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/weather-lab-ai-cyclone-prediction-tracking/">cyclones</a>, <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/google-maps-apis-environment-sustainability/">air quality</a> and many more.</p><p data-block-key="7f7d5">We recently introduced <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-earth-ai/">Google Earth AI</a>, bringing together these geospatial models to help tackle the planet's most critical needs.

Here’s how:</p><h2 data-block-key="49q74">Connecting the dots with Geospatial Reasoning</h2><p data-block-key="7efd5">To solve a complex problem, you need to see the whole picture, not just one piece of it. That’s the idea behind <a href="https://research.google/blog/geospatial-reasoning-unlocking-insights-with-generative-ai-and-multiple-foundation-models/">Geospatial Reasoning</a>, a framework powered by Gemini that now lets AI automatically connect different Earth AI models — like weather forecasts, population maps and satellite imagery — to answer complex questions.</p><p data-block-key="an3ok">Instead of just seeing where a storm might hit, our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18318">latest research demonstrates</a> that analysts can use Geospatial Reasoning to identify which communities are most vulnerable and what infrastructure is at risk, all at once. For example, Geospatial Reasoning empowers the nonprofit GiveDirectly to respond to disasters by combining flood and population density information, helping them identify who needs direct aid most.</p><p data-block-key="4vll1"><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfhp8WXrhxAwPlOQxaAJK6qFY3Ga74RONC62W3qhVI7pcVhZw/viewform">Sign up</a> for consideration to become a Trusted Tester for Geospatial Reasoning.

            <pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 16:56:07 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/memory">https://www.anthropic.com/news/memory</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45684134">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><div><ul><li><div><p><span>Update</span></p><p>Expanding to Pro and Max plans</p><p>Oct 23, 2025</p></div></li></ul></div><div id="accordion-content-undefined" role="region" aria-labelledby="accordion-header-undefined"><p>Whether you’re iterating on a strategy proposal, debugging an issue, or managing multiple projects, Claude picks up right where you left off. Like Team and Enterprise users, you get project-scoped memory (each project has its own separate memory), full control to view and edit what Claude remembers, and incognito chat for conversations that don’t save to memory.</p><p>Before this rollout, we ran extensive safety testing across sensitive wellbeing-related topics and edge cases—including whether memory could reinforce harmful patterns in conversations, lead to over-accommodation, and enable attempts to bypass our safeguards. Through this testing, we identified areas where Claude's responses needed refinement and made targeted adjustments to how memory functions. These iterations helped us build and improve the memory feature in a way that allows Claude to provide helpful and safe responses to users.</p><p>To get started, enable memory in Settings.</p></div><p>Today, we’re introducing memory to the Claude app, where Claude remembers you and your team’s projects and preferences, eliminating the need to re-explain context and keeping complex work moving forward.</p><p>Memory is <em>fully optional</em>, with granular user controls that help you manage what Claude remembers. We’re also introducing Incognito chats that don’t appear in your conversation history or save to memory.</p><p>Memory is rolling out to Team and Enterprise plan users starting today. Enterprise admins can choose whether to disable memory for their organization at any time. Incognito chat is available to all Claude users.</p><p>With memory, Claude focuses on learning your professional context and work patterns to maximize productivity. It remembers your team’s processes, client needs, project details, and priorities. Sales teams keep client context across deals, product teams maintain specifications across sprints, and executives track initiatives without constantly rebuilding context.</p><p>If you use projects, <strong>Claude creates a separate memory for each project</strong>. This ensures that your product launch planning stays separate from client work, and confidential discussions remain separate from general operations. These project boundaries help you and your teams manage complex, concurrent initiatives without mixing unrelated details, serving as a safety guardrail that keeps sensitive conversations contained.</p><div><figure><img alt="Two side-by-side Claude chat interface screenshots showing project-specific conversations" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fdf07c7b9ef0cc93ce36d477835c3ef3b76832bde-1920x1080.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fdf07c7b9ef0cc93ce36d477835c3ef3b76832bde-1920x1080.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fdf07c7b9ef0cc93ce36d477835c3ef3b76832bde-1920x1080.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure></div><p>Claude uses a memory summary to capture all its memories in one place for you to view and edit. In your settings, you can see exactly what Claude remembers from your conversations, and update the summary at any time by chatting with Claude. Based on what you tell Claude to focus on or to ignore, Claude will adjust the memories it references.</p><h2 id="incognito-chat">Incognito chat</h2><p>Sometimes you need Claude’s help without using or adding to memory. Incognito chat gives you a clean slate for conversations that you don’t want to preserve in memory. It is perfect for sensitive brainstorming, confidential strategy discussions, or when you simply want a fresh conversation without context from previous chats. Your regular memory and conversation history remain untouched. If you’re using memory on a Team or Enterprise plan, your standard data retention settings apply.</p><div><figure><img alt="A Claude chat interface in Incognito mode, indicated by a ghost icon and &quot;Incognito chat&quot; label in the dark header bar" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F840fdac9eecf90cf4aa4377f9ad80ddafcab2d4e-1920x1080.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F840fdac9eecf90cf4aa4377f9ad80ddafcab2d4e-1920x1080.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F840fdac9eecf90cf4aa4377f9ad80ddafcab2d4e-1920x1080.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure></div><h2 id="starting-with-teams-at-work">Starting with teams at work</h2><p>Memory introduces new safety considerations and we've designed the feature to be useful in work settings, while avoiding sensitive conversations and topics. We're also taking a thoughtful phased approach to ensure these powerful capabilities are deployed responsibly, and will continue to evaluate and test how memory works across the different ways people use Claude before expanding availability.</p><h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2><p>To see memory in action, enable the feature in Settings, and let Claude generate memory with your past chats at initial set-up. Ask Claude questions like “what were we working on last week?” to see what Claude remembers across your existing chats and connected tools. If you would like to bring your memory details over from a different AI tool or export your memory from Claude for backup or migration, you can <a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/12123587-importing-and-exporting-your-memory-from-claude" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">follow these instructions</a>.</p><p>Great work builds over time. With memory, each conversation with Claude improves the next.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — In the midst of a federal government shutdown, the U.S. government’s gross national debt surpassed $38 trillion Wednesday, a record number that highlights the accelerating accumulation of debt on America’s balance sheet. </p><p>It’s also the fastest accumulation of a trillion dollars in debt outside of the COVID-19 pandemic — the <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/treasury-debt-spending-trump-obbb-6f807c4aae78dcc96f29ff07a3c926f4" rel="nofollow">U.S. hit $37 trillion in gross</a></span> national debt in August this year. </p><p>The $38 trillion update is found in the <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/daily-treasury-statement/operating-cash-balance" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">latest Treasury Department report</a></span>, which logs the nation’s daily finances.</p><p>Kent Smetters of the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget Model, who served in President George W. Bush’s Treasury Department, told The Associated Press that a growing debt load over time leads ultimately to higher inflation, eroding Americans’ purchasing power. </p><p>The <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.gao.gov/americas-fiscal-future/how-could-federal-debt-affect-you" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Government Accountability Office</a></span> outlines some of the impacts of rising government debt on Americans — including higher borrowing costs for things like mortgages and cars, lower wages from businesses having less money available to invest, and more expensive goods and services.</p>
    
<p>“I think a lot of people want to know that their kids and grandkids are going to be in good, decent shape in the future — that they will be able to afford a house,” Smetters said. “That additional inflation compounds” and erodes consumers’ purchasing power, he said, making it less possible for future generations to achieve home ownership goals. </p>



<p>The Trump administration says its policies are helping to slow government spending and will shrink the nation’s massive deficit. A new analysis by Treasury Department officials states that from April to September, the cumulative deficit totaled $468 billion. In a post on X Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that’s the lowest reading since 2019.</p>
    
    
    
<p>“During his first eight months in office, President Trump has reduced the deficit by $350 billion compared to the same period in 2024 by cutting spending and boosting revenue,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement, adding that the administration would pursue robust economic growth, lower inflation, tariff revenue, lower borrowing costs and cuts to waste, fraud and abuse. </p>
    
<p>The Joint Economic Committee <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/republicans/debt-dashboard#:~:text=July%202025%20%7C%20Released%20July%2008,reached%20in%20approximately%20194%20days." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">estimates</a></span> that the total national debt has grown by $69,713.82 per second for the past year.</p><p>Michael Peterson, chair and CEO of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, said in a statement that “reaching $38 trillion in debt during a government shutdown is the latest troubling sign that lawmakers are not meeting their basic fiscal duties.”</p><p>“Along with increasing debt, you get higher interest costs, which are now the fastest growing part of the budget,” Peterson added. “We spent $4 trillion on interest over the last decade, but will spend $14 trillion in the next ten years. Interest costs crowd out important public and private investments in our future, harming the economy for every American.”</p><p>The U.S. hit $34 trillion in debt in January 2024, $35 trillion in July 2024 and $36 trillion in November 2024.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>I’m currently writing <a href="https://github.com/Juptune/juptune">Juptune</a> - a toy async I/O framework that attempts to implement as much of its stack as possible in pure D.</p>
<p>I’m really interested in writing an implementation of TLS, which means I need to be able to handle x.509 certificates (i.e. TLS/SSL certs), which means I need to be able to handle their underlying data encoding: ASN.1’s DER encoding.</p>
<p>So basically I just wanted to do this <em>for fun</em> at the end of the day, nothing much deeper than that. I’ve never written or worked on a proper compiler project before that wasn’t toy-sized so I saw a ton of growth potential… the main thing that’s grown however is the mental scar ASN.1’s left on me.</p>
<p>I’ve succesfully generated code that can parse a couple of x.509 certificates I’ve thrown at it, and I’ve started work on an almost-D-native (excluding crypto primitives) implementation of TLS 1.3.</p>
<p>I’m constantly amazed about how much of modern life relies on these ancient, overly complicated specs from the 90s. ASN.1 is used <em>everywhere</em> in some form or another and yet I bet you’ve never even heard of it before, just have a look on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASN.1#Applications">wikipedia</a>.</p>
<h2 id="very-briefly---what-is-asn1"><em>Very</em> briefly - what is ASN.1?</h2>
<p>ASN.1 is the result of a bunch of graybeards from the late 80s+ trying to design an overengineered data specification language. In other words, it’s protobuf on steroids.</p>
<p>There’s two parts of ASN.1: There’s the ASN.1 notation (defined by x.680, x.681, x.682, and x.683), and then there’s the various encodings (BER, CER, DER, PER, XER, JER…). In this post I’ll mainly be focusing on the notation + DER.</p>
<p>Similarly to protobuf you use the notation to define a structured way to represent data, and then use tooling that can generate encoders/decoders for a specific encoding, in a specific programming language.</p>
<p>Here’s a choice snippet of the ASN.1 notation for RFC 5280 (which defines what’s commonly known as TLS certificates):</p>

<p>Encoding wise here’s a quick of some of the more well known ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>BER - Basic binary encoding rules. Uses a Tag-Length-Value (TLV) format that supports functionally infinite lengths of data.</li>
<li>CER - A limited subset of BER where each value can only have one possible encoding. It uses some odd design choices (such as <em>always</em> using the infinite-length forms of encoded data), so no one really uses it.</li>
<li>DER - A limited subset of BER where each value can only have one possible encoding, but with a more sane choice of decisions made compared to CER. This is used extensively for cryptographic purposes.</li>
<li>PER - A binary encoding that uses contraint information to encode data in the absolute minimum amount of bits possible. There’s also like 4 variations of this one btw.</li>
<li>OER - Similar to PER except it keeps the bytes of values separate, whereas PER can pack the bits of different values together tightly.</li>
<li>XER - An XML based encoding. The ASN.1 notation grammar actually has XML-specific parts to it just for this encoding (because of course it does).</li>
<li>JER - A JSON based encoding.</li>
</ul>
<p>Did I ever mention that ASN.1 is complicated? On the one hand the sheer amount of possible encodings is daunting, but on the other hand it shows a certain flexbility that ASN.1 provides - you could even invent your own domain-specific encoding if needed.</p>
<h2 id="asn1s-notation-can-be-really-complex">ASN.1’s notation can be really complex</h2>
<p>Loosely speaking you can define ASN.1’s notation as being the “base” notation defined in x.680, with the sometimes-optional addon specifications defined in x.681, x.682, x.683.</p>
<p>These specifications are also written in academicese so for mere uneducated mortals such as myself, simply trying to read and understand what the specifications are saying in the first place is already a large hurdle. I <em>think</em> I’ve started to get the hang of it though.</p>
<p>Fortunately for my use case of handling x.509 certificates, there’s no hard requirement for anything beyond x.680 and so x.680 is the only spec I’ve attempted to implement so far (outside of x.690 which describes how BER/CER/DER works - which is actually a <em>joy</em> to read compared to the x.68x specs).</p>
<p>x.680 isn’t the worst thing in the world to implement, it’s just the fact that there’s a <em>lot</em> more to it than you’d think from a quick glance at a code example, as well as some relatively annoying “transformation” (semantic) rules you have to acccount for.</p>
<p>Generally though I’d say the really difficult parts seem to come from its extensions.</p>
<h3 id="x680-woes---historical-deprecations">x.680 woes - historical deprecations</h3>
<p>One of the more annoying parts of implementing a parser for ASN.1’s notation is that x.680 has been revised several times over the years, which includes the deprecation + removal of certain features.</p>
<p>And so some other specifications you read through will either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use older forms of syntax that are no longer recommended/supported.</li>
<li>Replace the older forms of syntax with newer variants which can be <em>much</em> more complicated to implement.</li>
</ol>
<p>Meaning that if you want to write a compiler for ASN.1 for a specific use case, but want it to also be an implementation of the more modern specs… then you’ll have to partially implement/hack around some of the older stuff that’s no longer defined in the up to date spec documentation.</p>
<p>An example would be the <code>ANY DEFINED BY</code> syntax, which I have a separate section on.</p>
<h3 id="x681">x.681</h3>
<p>This is essentially the academic equivalent of an Elder Scroll - you will go insane attempting to read let alone mentally parse this damn thing.</p>
<p>x.681 describes the Information Class Object system. I’d <em>love</em> to talk to you more about it more in depth but I haven’t put in enough effort to confidently state much about how it works.</p>
<p>One of the few parts I sort of understand and can talk about is that x.681 has a really cool feature where Information Classes can be given a custom initialisation syntax:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="txt"><code><div><p><span>-- Given this information class</span></p></div><div><p><span>PERSON ::= CLASS {</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>&amp;name UTF8String,</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>&amp;age INTEGER DEFAULT 0</span></p></div><div><p><span>}</span></p></div><div><p><span>WITH SYNTAX {</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>CALLED &amp;name [WHO IS &amp;age YEARS OLD]</span></p></div><div><p><span>}</span></p></div><div><p><span>-- Can be initialised as either one of these</span></p></div><div><p><span>bradley1 PERSON ::= { CALLED "Bradley" }</span></p></div><div><p><span>bradley2 PERSON ::= { CALLED "Bradley" WHO IS 26 YEARS OLD }</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>I’d absolutely love to attempt to implement x.681 for the challenge of this feature alone, however I only have so much energy (and sanity), so it’ll likely be a while until I even properly consider it.</p>
<h3 id="x682">x.682</h3>
<p>x.682 describes the Table Constraint feature. I’m going to be honest I don’t understand a single thing about this feature - I took one look at the specification and was like “absolutely not”.</p>
<h3 id="x683">x.683</h3>
<p>x.683 describes the ability to create templated (sorry, “parameterised”) types. Similar to the other ASN.1 extensions I haven’t looked much into this feature, but it appears to be a lot simpler to implement than the others.</p>
<p>In essence, one of the things you can do is this:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="txt"><code><div><p><span>MyTemplatedThingy{ValueT} ::= SEQUENCE {</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>value ValueT</span></p></div><div><p><span>}</span></p></div><div><p><span>MyStringThingy ::= MyTemplatedThingy{UTF8String}</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>It supports values as well as types within its template parameters (similarly to D!) so there’s a few cool things you can do with it I guess.</p>
<h2 id="asn1s-notation-is-also-pretty-cool">ASN.1’s notation is also pretty cool!</h2>
<p>Despite the many, <em>many</em>, <strong>many</strong> pains of this god forsaken technology, it’s actually really interesting and powerful at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="asn1s-constraint-system">ASN.1’s constraint system</h3>
<p>ASN.1’s notation contains a pretty neat feature where you can add special constraints onto types + fields. So rather than having a stray “ProtcolPacket.field1.field2.xyz MUST be between 0 and 2” that’s super easy to miss, you can instead describe this constraint within ASN.1 itself which (good) tooling will then take into account for you.</p>
<p>Here’s some examples of the simpler constraints available:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="txt"><code><div><p><span>UInt8 ::= INTEGER (0..255) -- Constrain to a specific range of values</span></p></div><div><p><span>LegacyFlag ::= INTEGER (0) -- Constrain to a single value</span></p></div><div><p><span>LegacyFlags ::= INTEGER (0 | 2 | 4 | 8) -- You can combine constraints via the UNION (shorthand '|') operator.</span></p></div><div><p><span>LegacyFlags2 ::= INTEGER (0 | 2 ^ 4..8) -- You can also use the INTERSECTION (shorthand '^') operator to specify alternatively valid constraints.</span></p></div><div><p><span>-- You can limit the size of some types</span></p></div><div><p><span>Password ::= UTF8String (SIZE (8..32)) -- Must be between 8 and 32 chars.</span></p></div><div><p><span>NumberList ::= SET SIZE (2..MAX) OF INTEGER -- Must have at least 2 elements, but is otherwise unbounded.</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>There’s a few more constraints available but… they’re mostly pretty complex ones that I don’t want to have to think about.</p>
<p>It’s really cool to see that ASN.1 has a feature like this though, considering the only other langauge I’ve personally encountered that has a similar feature is Ada.</p>
<h3 id="asn1s-versioning-system">ASN.1’s versioning system</h3>
<p>ASN.1 generally uses the <code>OBJECT IDENTIFIER</code> type in order to, well, identify specific things, e.g. extensions found within x.509 certificates.</p>
<p><code>OBJECT IDENTIFIER</code>s are also used to provide versions to modules, for example:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="txt"><code><div><p><span>PKIX1Implicit88 {</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1)</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) id-mod(0) id-pkix1-implicit(19)</span></p></div><div><p><span>} DEFINITIONS IMPLICIT TAGS ::= BEGIN -- .. -- END</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>Everything between the curly brackets is an OBJECT IDENTIFIER for this exact module - technically no other ASN.1 module in existance should ever use this specific OBJECT IDENTIFIER. The optional labels (e.g. <code>iso</code>) have no meaning beyond aiding human comprehension, it’s the values (e.g. <code>(0)</code>) that are actually used to create the identifier.</p>
<p>As a great example of this versioning system, it just so happens that this specific module has a more modern version that has this specific OBJECT IDENTIFIER instead:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="txt"><code><div><p><span>PKIX1Implicit-2009</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>{iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1) security(5)</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>mechanisms(5) pkix(7) id-mod(0) id-mod-pkix1-implicit-02(59)}</span></p></div><div><p><span>DEFINITIONS IMPLICIT TAGS ::= BEGIN -- .. -- END</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>This updated version doesn’t change how data is encoded to/from DER but instead it simply uses more modern syntax and features.</p>
<p>This is important because older specifications will be using <code>PKIX1Implicit88</code> whereas newer ones will likely be using <code>PKIX1Implicit-2009</code> instead, and so there needs to be a more clear-cut way to distinguish between these two versions of the <code>PKIX1Implicit</code> module other than going by its name - and this is where OBJECT IDENTIFIERS come in handy.</p>
<p>When importing modules within ASN.1 notation you can (and should) specify an OBJECT IDENTIFIER as well:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="txt"><code><div><p><span>-- There's 0 room for ambiguity or naming clashes when OBJECT IDENTIFIERs come into play</span></p></div><div><p><span>IMPORTS</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>id-pkix FROM PKIX1Implicit88 {</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>        </span></span><span>iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1)</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>        </span></span><span>security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) id-mod(0) id-pkix1-implicit(19)</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>},</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>SignatureAlgs FROM PKIX1Implicit-2009 {</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>        </span></span><span>iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1) security(5)</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>        </span></span><span>mechanisms(5) pkix(7) id-mod(0) id-mod-pkix1-implicit-02(59)</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>}</span></p></div><div><p><span>;</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>Maybe I’m just a nerd, but I find this to almost be a thing of beauty with how simple yet effective it is.</p>
<h2 id="d-is-easy-to-generate-code-for">D is easy to generate code for</h2>
<p>D has several quality of life features that makes it surprisingly easy to generate code for - features that would definitely make the compiler more annoying to work with when targeting other languages.</p>
<p>These features on their own aren’t exactly rare to see, but the specific combination is what makes everything work together so well.</p>
<h3 id="static-imports--fully-qualified-names">Static imports &amp; fully qualified names</h3>
<p><code>static import</code> in D means “import this module, but ONLY allow it to be used via its fully qualified name”:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="d"><code><div><p><span>static import</span><span> </span><mark><span>std.stdio</span></mark><span>;</span></p></div><div><p><span>// Good!</span></p></div><div><p><mark><span>std.stdio</span></mark><span>.writeln</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, world!"</span><span>);</span></p></div><div><p><span>// Bad!</span></p></div><div><p><span>writeln</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, world!"</span><span>);</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>You can even override the module name, as strange as that sounds!</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="d"><code><div><p><span>static import</span><span> </span><mark><span>io</span><span> </span></mark><span>= </span><span>std.stdio</span><span>;</span></p></div><div><p><mark><span>io.</span></mark><span>writeln</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, world!"</span><span>);</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>This feature is a godsend for preserving the original names of ASN.1 types. For example, Juptune provides an error type called <code>Result</code> which comes from the <code>juptune.core.util.result</code> module.</p>
<p>Without static imports I’d have to be careful of ASN.1 code that defines a <code>Result</code> type as it’d otherwise come into conflict with Juptune’s own <code>Result</code> type.</p>
<p>However, with static imports, I can basically just generate code that looks like this:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="d"><code><div><p><span>static import</span><span> </span><span>jres</span><span> = </span><span>juptune.core.util.result</span><span>;</span></p></div><div><p><span>// From ASN.1 definition: Result ::= SEQUENCE { -- yada yada -- }</span></p></div><div><p><span>struct</span><span> </span><span>Result</span></p></div><div><p><span>{</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><mark><span>jres.Result</span></mark><span> </span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>/*...*/</span><span>) </span><span>@nogc</span><span> </span><span>nothrow</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>{</span></p></div><div><p><span>        </span><span>/*...*/</span></p></div><div><p><span>        </span><span>return</span><span> </span><mark><span>jres.Result</span></mark><span>.noError</span><span>;</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>}</span></p></div><div><p><span>}</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>Completely removing the need of me having to worry about symbol name conflicts.</p>
<h3 id="module-local-lookups">Module-local lookups</h3>
<p>On a similar vein D allows you to specify that instead of looking up a symbol from any available symbol table (e.g. local vars; non-static imports, etc.) it should instead perform a lookup using the current module’s top-level symbols.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="d"><code><div><p><span>/* Given this ASN.1 notation:</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>Type1 ::= SEQUENCE { -- yada yada -- }</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>Type2 ::= SEQUENCE { type2 Type2 }</span></p></div><div><p><span>*/</span></p></div><div><p><span>// The following types are generated</span></p></div><div><p><span>struct</span><span> </span><span>Type1</span><span> { </span><span>/* yada yada */</span><span> }</span></p></div><div><p><span>struct</span><span> </span><span>Type2</span></p></div><div><p><span>{</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>private</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>{</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>        </span></span><mark><span>.</span><span>Type1</span></mark><span> </span><span>_type1</span><span>;</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>}</span></p></div><div><p><span>}</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>The leading <code>.</code> in <code>.Type1</code> is what causes the module-local lookup.</p>
<p>Essentially, this feature compliments the static import feature to help make it much harder for ASN.1 types to accidentally refer to the wrong symbol when converted into D code.</p>
<h3 id="typeof">typeof()</h3>
<p>In short: this feature allowed me to be <em>really really</em> lazy with certain parts of the compiler :D</p>
<p>As the name suggests, <code>typeof()</code> allows you to retrieve the type of any particular symbol you pass into it - this is great when dealing with code generation since sometimes it can be <em>kind of annoying</em> to structure your code in a way where you can easily preserve the type name of some symbol you’re working with.</p>
<p>In other words “this let’s me write bad code and make it still work”.</p>
<p>First example is around how some getters and setters for SEQEUENCE fields are generated. Instead of doing the correct thing and preserving the type name for each field, I got lazy and just used <code>typeof(_field)</code>:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="d"><code><div><p><span>// Heavily omitted example</span></p></div><div><p><span>struct</span><span> </span><span>Dss_Parms</span></p></div><div><p><span>{</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>private</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>{</span></p></div><div><p><span>        </span><span>asn1.Asn1Integer</span><span> </span><span>_p</span><span>;</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>}</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>jres.Result</span><span> </span><span>setP</span><span>(</span><mark><span>typeof(</span><span>_p</span><span>)</span></mark><span> </span><span>value</span><span>) </span><span>@nogc</span><span> </span><span>nothrow</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>{ </span><span>/* .. */</span><span> }</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><mark><span>typeof(</span><span>_p</span><span>)</span></mark><span> </span><span>getP</span><span>() </span><span>@nogc</span><span> </span><span>nothrow</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>{ </span><span>/* .. */</span><span> }</span></p></div><div><p><span>}</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>The second example is around error messages. Instead of needing to keep track of the current type’s name when generating error messages… I could just use <code>typeof(this)</code> to get the type instead:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="d"><code><div><p><span>// Heavily omitted example</span></p></div><div><p><span>struct</span><span> </span><span>Dss_Parms</span></p></div><div><p><span>{</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>jres.Result</span><span> </span><span>fromDecoding</span><span>(</span><span>/* .. */</span><span>) </span><span>@nogc</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>{</span></p></div><div><p><span>        </span><span>/* .. */</span></p></div><div><p><span>        </span><span>result</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>asn1.asn1DecodeComponentHeader</span><span>!</span><span>ruleset</span><span>(</span><span>memory</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>componentHeader</span><span>);</span></p></div><div><p><span>        </span><span>if</span><span>(</span><span>result.isError</span><span>)</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>        </span></span><span>{</span></p></div><div><p><span>            </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>result.wrapError</span><span>(</span></p></div><div><p><span>                </span><span>"when decoding header of field 'p' in type "</span></p></div><div><p><span>                </span><span>~__traits(</span><span>identifier</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>typeof(this))</span></p></div><div><p><span>                </span><span>~</span><span>":"</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>            </span></span><span>);</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>        </span></span><span>}</span></p></div><div><p><span>        </span><span>/* .. */</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>}</span></p></div><div><p><span>}</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>What’s <em>even better</em> is that because the entire string is composed of compile-time constants, it doesn’t actually require an allocation + concat at runtime since the compiler will constant fold it for you. This allows <code>fromDecoding</code> to still be marked as <code>@nogc</code>!</p>

<p>D’s got your back! (Except for specifying multiple modules in a single import statement, then for some reason you’re not allowed, but shh about that).</p>
<h3 id="utilise-metaprogramming-so-your-compiler-can-stay-dumbpoorly-made">Utilise metaprogramming so your compiler can stay dumb/poorly made</h3>
<p>For a while a lot of the types being generated (and some of the core decoding types) didn’t have a <code>toString</code> implementation. This’d normally mean that I couldn’t just use <code>.toString</code> willy-nilly but instead the compiler would need knowledge about which types had a <code>toString</code> or not.</p>
<p>However, as is the common theme now D allows us to be very lazy - instead of keeping track of this ourselves in dasn1, we can instead just generate code where it’s the D compiler’s concern instead of our’s:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="d"><code><div><p><span>// Heavily omitted</span></p></div><div><p><span>struct</span><span> </span><span>Dss_Parms</span></p></div><div><p><span>{</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>void</span><span> </span><span>toString</span><span>(</span><span>SinkT</span><span>)(</span><span>scope</span><span> </span><span>SinkT</span><span> </span><span>sink</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>depth</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>)</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>{</span></p></div><div><p><span>        </span><span>/* .. */</span></p></div><div><p><span>        </span><span>static if(__traits(</span><span>hasMember</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>typeof(</span><span>_p</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>"toString"</span><span>))</span></p></div><div><p><span>            </span><span>_p.toString</span><span>(</span><span>sink</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>depth</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>);</span></p></div><div><p><span>        </span><span>else</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>        </span></span><span>{</span></p></div><div><p><span>            </span><span>putIndent</span><span>();</span></p></div><div><p><span>            </span><span>sink</span><span>(</span><span>"&lt;no toString impl&gt;</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span><span>);</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>        </span></span><span>}</span></p></div><div><p><span>        </span><span>/* .. */</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>}</span></p></div><div><p><span>}</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>Job sorted (and future proofed!).</p>
<p>You could definitely utilise D’s metaprogramming for more complicated stuff, but it’s also good for silly little things like this.</p>
<h2 id="interesting-d-specific-parts-of-the-implementation">Interesting D-specific parts of the implementation</h2>
<p>Naturally I’ve tried to use whatever D features that I could in order to implement dasn1, so I thought I’d pick a few parts of the code that rely on D’s features quite heavily as a small showcase.</p>
<h3 id="mixin-templates-for-ast-nodes">Mixin templates for AST nodes</h3>
<p>Mixin templates are a fairly quirky feature of D - it allows you to define a normal template (essentially a compile-time collection of symbols) and then copy-paste them wherever you like, whether that’s inside a class, struct, the top-level module etc.</p>

<p>I probably could’ve gotten away with just using templated base classes instead, but there’s a few differences that actually make that kind of annoying. Namely it’d create some bloated symbol names which would make reading compiler errors even more painful than it already ended up being.</p>
<h3 id="templates-can-provide-really-natural-apis-while-still-catching-errors-at-compile-time">Templates can provide really natural APIs while still catching errors at compile time</h3>
<p>Let’s look at one of the AST nodes again:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="d"><code><div><p><span>final</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>Asn1ModuleDefinitionNode</span><span> : </span><span>Asn1BaseNode</span></p></div><div><p><span>{</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>mixin</span><span> </span><span>Container</span><span>!(</span><span>Asn1NodeType.ModuleDefinition</span><span>,</span></p></div><div><p><span>        </span><span>Asn1ModuleIdentifierNode</span><span>,</span></p></div><div><p><span>        </span><span>Asn1TagDefaultNode</span><span>,</span></p></div><div><p><span>        </span><span>Asn1ExtensionDefaultNode</span><span>,</span></p></div><div><p><span>        </span><span>Asn1ModuleBodyNode</span><span>,</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>);</span></p></div><div><p><span>}</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>This is a node that contains several other nodes. <code>Container</code> itself supports an unbounded amount of node types it can store, since D supports variadic template parameters. You may be asking what the API for this even looks like, and I’ll be glad to show you a quick snippet:</p>

<p>This node has a similar template-based API for most of its operations:</p>

<p>However the main feature of the <code>OneOf</code> node is its <code>match</code> function. This function requires the user to pass in a handler function for each possible node type that the <code>OneOf</code> can store, and this requirement is enforced at compile-time so that changes to the node type list will immediately require all appropriate <code>match</code> functions to be updated (i.e. no silent breakage).</p>
<p>This is surprisingly easy to implement with D due to its first-class metaprogramming features, I’ll try my best to be brief with how this all works:</p>

<p>In essence:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>NodeTypes...</code> is the template parameter containing a compile-time tuple of all possible types that this <code>OneOf</code> can store.</li>
<li><code>oneOfHandlerFuncTuple</code> is a template that generates a new compile-time tuple, where each <code>NodeTypes</code> is mapped into a function pointer type.</li>
<li><code>match</code> uses the result of <code>oneOfHandlerFuncTuple</code> as its main parameter. Since this is a compile-time tuple of types it automagically gets expanded into multiple parameters under the hood.</li>
<li><code>static foreach</code> within <code>match</code>’s body allows us to iterate over a compile-time collection (in this case, <code>NodeTypes</code>) and duplicate the foreach’s body for each item. In this case, so we can make a <code>case</code> statement per item in <code>NodeTypes</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <code>NodeTypes...</code> is <code>(Node1, Node2)</code>.</li>
<li><code>oneOfHandlerFuncTuple</code> results in <code>(Result delegate(Node1), Result delegate(Node2))</code></li>
<li>And <code>match</code>’s parameters expand into <code>match(scope delegate(Node1) handler_0, scope delegate(Node2) handler_1)</code></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Which means</em> that we could use this example match function like so:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="d"><code><div><p><span>ExampleOneOf</span><span> </span><span>node</span><span>;</span></p></div><div><p><span>node.match</span><span>(</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>(</span><span>Node1</span><span> </span><span>child</span><span>){ </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>Result.noError</span><span>; }</span><span>,</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>(</span><span>Node2</span><span> </span><span>child</span><span>){ </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>Result.noError</span><span>; }</span><span>,</span></p></div><div><p><span>);</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>I know that’s a lot to take in especially since I have to be briefer than usual, but TL;DR D makes the hard stuff easy while still being relatively easy on the eyes. I would make a snarky comparison with C++ but literally no one expects C++ metaprogramming to be readable at this point.</p>
<h3 id="d-snark-the-forever-experimental-allocator-package">D Snark: The forever-experimental allocator package</h3>
<p>10 years ago (October 2015) D’s standard library was given an experimental package called <code>std.experimental.allocator</code>. It has a pretty neat but kind of janky way of composing a bunch of allocation building blocks together, in order to “easily” make custom allocators.</p>
<p>I use it for the ASN.1 stuff since it makes it easy to construct and dispose classes within <code>@nogc</code> code, and it looks kind of cool to boot:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="d"><code><div><p><span>import</span><span> </span><span>std.experimental.allocator.mallocator</span><span>                        : </span><span>Mallocator</span><span>;</span></p></div><div><p><span>import</span><span> </span><span>std.experimental.allocator.building_blocks.allocator_list</span><span>    : </span><span>AllocatorList</span><span>;</span></p></div><div><p><span>import</span><span> </span><span>std.experimental.allocator.building_blocks.region</span><span>            : </span><span>Region</span><span>;</span></p></div><div><p><span>import</span><span> </span><span>std.experimental.allocator.building_blocks.stats_collector</span><span>   : </span><span>StatsCollector</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Stats</span><span> = </span><span>Options</span><span>;</span></p></div><div><p><span>private</span><span> </span><span>alias</span><span> </span><span>NodeAllocator</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>StatsCollector</span><span>!(</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>AllocatorList</span><span>!(</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>        </span></span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> </span><span>Region</span><span>!</span><span>Mallocator</span><span>(</span><span>1024</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>1024</span><span>)</span><span>,</span></p></div><div><p><span>        </span><span>Mallocator</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>)</span><span>,</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>Stats.bytesAllocated</span></p></div><div><p><span>);</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>The issue is this package is still experimental 10 years later and I wouldn’t be surprised if it gets removed sooner or later, especially with the Phobos v2 work that’ll hopefully exist in some form before I retire (I’m 26).</p>
<p>:D The sign of someone who loves this damn language is that they can’t help but provide some level of historical snark. I have no further comments, I just miss the days I had hope for D’s future xD</p>

<p>We can initialise this struct like so:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="d"><code><div><p><span>alias</span><span> </span><span>ItemT</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>OneOf</span><span>!(</span><span>Asn1BaseIr</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Asn1ValueReferenceIr</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Asn1TypeReferenceIr</span><span>);</span></p></div><div><p><span>auto</span><span> </span><span>item</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>ItemT</span><span>(</span><span>cast(</span><span>Asn1ValueReferenceIr</span><span>)</span><span>null</span><span>); </span><span>// Fine (if we ignore it's null for this example)</span></p></div><div><p><span>auto</span><span> </span><span>item</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>ItemT</span><span>(</span><span>cast(</span><span>Asn1ImportsIr</span><span>)</span><span>null</span><span>); </span><span>// Not fine - compile-time error since we know the original type already</span></p></div><div><p><span>Asn1BaseIr</span><span> </span><span>ir</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>cast(</span><span>Asn1ValueReferenceIr</span><span>)</span><span>null</span><span>; </span><span>// Pretend its not null</span></p></div><div><p><span>auto</span><span> </span><span>item</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>ItemT</span><span>(</span><span>ir</span><span>); </span><span>// Fine - it looks like an Asn1BaseIr so we have to dynamically cast it at runtime to perform the type check, which passes.</span></p></div><div><p><span>Asn1BaseIr</span><span> </span><span>ir</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>cast(</span><span>Asn1ImportsIr</span><span>)</span><span>null</span><span>;</span></p></div><div><p><span>auto</span><span> </span><span>item</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>ItemT</span><span>(</span><span>ir</span><span>); </span><span>// Runtime error - dynamic casting failed.</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>Now the fun part comes from this weird <code>alias ir this;</code> line. Normally when working with a wrapper struct like this you’d have do something like:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="d"><code><div><p><span>ItemT</span><span> </span><span>item</span><span>;</span></p></div><div><p><span>if</span><span>(</span><span>Asn1ValueReferenceIr</span><span> </span><span>casted</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>cast(</span><span>Asn1ValueReferenceIr</span><span>)</span><span>item.getWrappedIrNode</span><span>())</span></p></div><div><p><span>{ </span><span>/* .. */</span><span> }</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>With <code>alias ir this;</code> anytime we try to perform an operation (e.g. casting; function calls, etc.) that the <code>OneOf</code> struct itself does not support, the compiler will instead try to use it on the <code>OneOf.ir</code> field instead:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="d"><code><div><p><span>alias</span><span> </span><span>ItemT</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>OneOf</span><span>!(</span><span>Asn1BaseIr</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Asn1ValueReferenceIr</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Asn1TypeReferenceIr</span><span>);</span></p></div><div><p><span>auto</span><span> </span><span>item</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>/* ... */</span><span>;</span></p></div><div><p><span>// Since `OneOf` doesn't overload the `opCast`, the following would normally fail.</span></p></div><div><p><span>cast(</span><span>Asn1ValueReferenceIr</span><span>)</span><span>item</span><span>; </span><span>// -&gt; item.opCast!Asn1ValueReferenceIr wouldn't work since its not overloaded by OneOf.</span></p></div><div><p><span>// The compiler sees the `alias ir this`, and so tries casting that instead.</span></p></div><div><p><span>cast(</span><span>Asn1ValueReferenceIr</span><span>)</span><span>item.ir</span><span>; </span><span>// This now works!</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>It’s a very weird, niche feature which might even get removed or at least deprecated in the future, but it allows for some mild syntax cleanup as shown above.</p>
<h3 id="versionunittest">version(unittest)</h3>
<p>Some of the IR types try to strictly limit the way that user code can query and interact with their data, mainly to help prevent potential memory corruption… at least that was my original, flawed reasoning.</p>
<p>This can be <em>awkward</em> when writing unittests, as sometimes you just need to query a very particular part of a type’s data without having to go through all of its hurdles.</p>
<p>And so by simply slapping <code>version(unittest)</code> onto a funciton definition, you now have an escape hatch that won’t make its way out into real code:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="d"><code><div><p><span>// Only compiles when unittests are also compiled.</span></p></div><div><p><span>version(unittest)</span><span> </span><span>IrT</span><span> </span><span>getByName</span><span>(</span><span>IrT</span><span> : </span><span>Asn1ValueIr</span><span>)(</span><span>const</span><span>(</span><span>char</span><span>)[] </span><span>name</span><span>)</span></p></div><div><p><span>{</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>cast(</span><span>IrT</span><span>)</span><span>this</span><span>._namedBits</span><span>[</span><span>name</span><span>];</span></p></div><div><p><span>}</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<h3 id="templates--with--terse-ish-test-harnesses">Templates + with() = terse-ish test harnesses</h3>
<p>There’s a few examples of this within the codebase. Sometimes unittests are for the most part identical except:</p>
<ul>
<li>They need to tweak a few types here and there.</li>
<li>They need an “initialiser” function that returns a different type from other unittests.</li>
<li>They need to change what the function-to-be-tested is (and thus what some of the types being used are).</li>
<li>Sometimes the test case type itself needs to have a few types changed.</li>
<li>Everything else is the same though between unittests - it’s mainly just types getting in the way.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s one of those things where you kind of just have to use it and do it before you “get it”, so I apologise for the really poor explanation, but this is essentially something you can do with templates.</p>
<p>Here’s one of the templated “test harnesses” I used - this one in particular is for testing the AST -&gt; IR converter functions.</p>

<p>One main issue, especially for the larger tests, is that specifying <code>Harness.T</code> (and more minorly <code>Harness.run</code>) can start to make the code look chunky and a bit harder to read.</p>
<p>So by using the magical <code>with()</code> statement, instead of writing <code>Harness.run</code> and <code>Harness.T</code>, we can just write <code>run</code> and <code>T</code> and the compiler will know how to lookup these otherwise missing/undefined symbols:</p>

<p>Again this is one of those things that on paper sounds really stupid (and impossible to easily describe), but grows on you really fast when you give it a try.</p>
<h2 id="pain-points">Pain points</h2>
<p>While ASN.1’s basic syntax looks pretty easy from an initial glance, that illusion shatters once you start getting into it more deeply.</p>
<h3 id="value-sequence-syntax">Value sequence syntax</h3>
<p>ASN.1 has various separate value forms that start with a left bracket (<code>{</code>), a lot of these forms are ambiguous due to a variety of factors and can only be distinguished with semantic context.</p>
<p>Given that dans1 has a clean split between syntax and semantic analysis, “this does not spark joy” as the kids would say.</p>
<p>I’ll let this comment from the parser code explain itself:</p>

<p>:D Fun times.</p>
<h3 id="its-hard-to-find-important-info-in-the-specs">It’s hard to find important info in the specs</h3>
<p>Example: I can’t even remember the exact conditions, but I remember having to debug some generated decoder code since it was failing to decode a specific field. It turned out that this field was under certain “exact conditions” that meant its tag was supposed to be treated as <code>EXPLICIT</code> instead of the module-default <code>IMPLICIT</code>.</p>
<p>I still have <em>no</em> idea where in the spec this behaviour gets mentioned and so I basically had to wing a fix and hope it works going forward.</p>
<p>More generally this feeling and scenario has happened quite a few times - the information is scattered (sometimes across different specs) and is hard to keep track of.</p>
<p>Another example is around module versions. The spec makes absolutely zero mention (that I can see) on how to version modules for non ISO/ITU purposes, and I would greatly appreciate if anyone could help me find this information.</p>
<p>I’d be amazed if there’s a 100% spec compliant implementation out there, even commercially.</p>
<h3 id="you-need-to-implement-constraints-3-separate-times">You need to implement constraints 3 separate times</h3>
<ol>
<li>The first implementation is to type-check constraints, e.g. <code>UTF8String (SIZE ("yagababa"))</code> doesn’t make sense.</li>
<li>The second implementation is to confirm that ASN.1 notation values are correct, e.g. <code>myInt INTEGER (1) ::= 2</code> needs to trigger an error.</li>
<li>The third implementation is to generate runtime checks when you generate code from the ASN.1 notation.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s tedious and not very fun, but there’s no real way around it.</p>
<p>For a newbie to compiler programming like me I also found it really hard to deal with useful error messages. I ended up running the checks twice: one time to see if there’s even an error at all, and the second time to build up the error string. This is mainly complicated by the existance of UNION and (especially) INTERSECTION constraints.</p>
<h3 id="the-dream-of-immutable-ir-nodes">The dream of immutable IR nodes</h3>
<p>I foolishly made the mistake of believing that once I converted the generic AST nodes into the more specific IR nodes that I wouldn’t have to make any major changes to the underlying data (beyond setting up things like symbol tables).</p>
<p>:D Unfortunately that wonderfully naive thought was quickly crushed as ASN.1 requires the semantic stage to perform certain transformations, certain transformations (e.g. <code>AUTOMATIC TAGS</code>) that ended up/are going to be really annoying due to the way I’ve structured the code.</p>
<p>But that’s future Brad’s problem.</p>
<h3 id="asn1-has-an-all-or-nothing-level-of-complexity">ASN.1 has an all-or-nothing level of complexity</h3>
<p>I am <strong>extremely</strong> thankful that x.509 is an old enough specification that the ASN.1 notation only uses the older syntax of x.680.</p>
<p>The alternative is that you’d <em>need</em> an implementation of the x.681, x.682, and x.683 specs to use any of the newer stuff - this is absolutely non-trivial to implement, and I imagine this is one of the many reasons ASN.1 hasn’t ever really taken off outside of historical and commercialised spaces.</p>
<h3 id="any-defined-by">ANY DEFINED BY</h3>
<p>There is one exception to the above however and that is <code>ANY DEFINED BY</code>.</p>
<p>It’d basically be used to define a type who’s contents could be <em>any other type</em> conditioned by some other field:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="txt"><code><div><p><span>Extension ::= SEQUENCE {</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>extension-type OBJECT IDENTIFIER,</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>extension-value ANY DEFINED BY extension-type</span></p></div><div><p><span>}</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>You then have to piece together what identifier matches which type. Dasn1 doesn’t actually implement <code>ANY DEFINED BY</code> as-is since even by the 2003 revision it was deprecated.</p>
<p>Instead, for better or for worse, dasn1 has a hacked together intrinsic called <code>Dasn1-Any</code>:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="txt"><code><div><p><span>-- Small snippet from https://github.com/Juptune/juptune/blob/master/data/asn1/rfc5280-explicit.asn1</span></p></div><div><p><span>-- (yeah the module version is super messed up, I'll fix it eventually)</span></p></div><div><p><span>IMPORTS</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>      </span></span><span>Dasn1-Any FROM Dasn1-Intrinsics { iso(0) custom(0) dasn1(1) intrinsics(0) }</span></p></div><div><p><span>;</span></p></div><div><p><span>AttributeTypeAndValue   ::= SEQUENCE {</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>        </span></span><span>type    AttributeType,</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>        </span></span><span>value   Dasn1-Any</span></p></div><div><p><span>}</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>This essentially gets lowered down into the decoding code for <code>OCTET STRING</code> but without any sort of tag validation enabled. Unfortunately until/unless I want to implement Information Object Classes, I’m then stuck with having to manually call into the decoding code when I want to turn <code>Dans1-Any</code> fields into their actual types.</p>
<h3 id="i-cant-retain-all-the-information-i-need-to-know">I can’t retain all the information I need to know</h3>
<p>This is more of a personal one.</p>
<p>Between the various different aspects of the ASN.1 compiler, the x.68x specs, the x.690 spec, and all of the other projects building off of this ASN.1 work (x.509 certificate handling, TLS 1.3) I started to feel like a stranger in my own codebase, even just a week after I had last touched it.</p>
<p>It’ll definitely be interesting making future improvements/changes as my at-hand knowledge is constantly dwindling.</p>
<h2 id="writing-a-compiler-is-tedious-work">Writing a compiler is tedious work</h2>
<p>From having to write 20,000 different node visitors for various reasons; to hand-rolling a syntax parser for a boring, drawn out grammar; to needing to write code that looks 95% the same as the last but that last 5% of difference ranges from drudge to mentally taxing, repeated 9000 times.</p>
<p>I think I can finally say I have some proper compiler experience under my belt ;(</p>
<p>But lord knows that each and every milestone has been so extremely rewarding (as long as I try not to think about the fact that almost no one will be using this code).</p>
<p>p.s. Don’t try to make a template-based parser combinator for the entire grammar of a language you don’t personally control unless you want to see symbol names that are 10Mb+ long and explode the binary size by over 100Mb. Don’t ask me how I know.</p>
<p>(I even hard crashed the D compiler I use once, since I guess the error message was literally too long. That endlessly scrolling console…)</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>A <em>probably</em> wasted year of my life later and there’s still an insane amount of work left on everything relating to this project (and Juptune) in general, but I think it’s making me a better programmer. Maybe.</p>
<p>The dream is that one day I can put “made an ASN.1 compiler + x.509 certificate handler + TLS 1.3 implementation” on my CV and still get told “sorry, you’re a good match except you don’t have 6 months of production experience in Ansible, we can’t hire you” by a recruiter. God I love this industry.</p>
<p>Don’t do ASN.1 kids, you’ll never be the same.</p> <section> <a href="https://bradley.chatha.dev/blog/dlang-propaganda">  </a> </section>  </section></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>Imagine a town with two widget merchants. Customers prefer cheaper widgets, so the merchants must compete to set the lowest price. Unhappy with their meager profits, they meet one night in a smoke-filled tavern to discuss a secret plan: If they raise prices together instead of competing, they can both make more money. But that kind of intentional price-fixing, called collusion, has long been illegal. The widget merchants decide not to risk it, and everyone else gets to enjoy cheap widgets.</p>
<p>For well over a century, U.S. law has followed this basic template: Ban those backroom deals, and fair prices should be maintained. These days, it’s not so simple. Across broad swaths of the economy, sellers increasingly rely on computer programs called learning algorithms, which repeatedly adjust prices in response to new data about the state of the market. These are often much simpler than the “deep learning” algorithms that power modern artificial intelligence, but they can still be prone to unexpected behavior.</p>
<p>So how can regulators ensure that algorithms set fair prices? Their traditional approach won’t work, as it relies on finding explicit collusion. “The algorithms definitely are not having drinks with each other,” said <a href="https://highlights.cis.upenn.edu/aaron-roth/">Aaron Roth</a>, a computer scientist at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Yet a <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3304991">widely cited 2019 paper</a> showed that algorithms could learn to collude tacitly, even when they weren’t programmed to do so. A team of researchers pitted two copies of a simple learning algorithm against each other in a simulated market, then let them explore different strategies for increasing their profits. Over time, each algorithm learned through trial and error to retaliate when the other cut prices — dropping its own price by some huge, disproportionate amount. The end result was high prices, backed up by mutual threat of a price war.</p>

<p>Implicit threats like this also underpin many cases of human collusion. So if you want to guarantee fair prices, why not just require sellers to use algorithms that are inherently incapable of expressing threats?</p>
<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03956">a recent paper</a>, Roth and four other computer scientists showed why this may not be enough. They proved that even seemingly benign algorithms that optimize for their own profit can sometimes yield bad outcomes for buyers. “You can still get high prices in ways that kind of look reasonable from the outside,” said <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~ncollina/">Natalie Collina</a>, a graduate student working with Roth who co-authored the new study.</p>
<p>Researchers don’t all agree on the implications of the finding — a lot hinges on how you define “reasonable.” But it reveals how subtle the questions around algorithmic pricing can get, and how hard it may be to regulate.</p>
<p>“Without some notion of a threat or an agreement, it’s very hard for a regulator to come in and say, ‘These prices feel wrong,’” said <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/malleshpai/">Mallesh Pai</a>, an economist at Rice University. “That’s one reason why I think this paper is important.”</p>
<h2><strong>No Regrets</strong></h2>
<p>The recent paper studies algorithmic pricing through the lens of game theory, an interdisciplinary field at the border of economics and computer science that analyzes the mathematics of strategic competitions. It’s one way to explore the failures of pricing algorithms in a controlled setting.</p>
<p>“What we’re trying to do is create collusion in the lab,” said <a href="https://joeharrington5201922.github.io/">Joseph Harrington</a>, a University of Pennsylvania economist who wrote an <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3037818">influential review paper</a> on regulating algorithmic collusion and was not involved in the new research. “Once we do so, we want to figure out how to destroy collusion.”</p>

<p>To understand the key ideas, it helps to start with the simple game of rock-paper-scissors. A learning algorithm, in this context, can be any strategy that a player uses to choose a move in each round based on data from previous rounds. Players might try out different strategies over the course of the game. But if they’re playing well, they’ll ultimately converge to a state that game theorists call equilibrium. In equilibrium, each player’s strategy is the best possible response to the other’s strategy, so neither player has an incentive to change.</p>
<p>In rock-paper-scissors, the ideal strategy is simple: You should play a random move each round, choosing all three possibilities equally often. Learning algorithms shine if one player takes a different approach. In that case, choosing moves based on previous rounds can help the other player win more often than if they just played randomly.</p>
<p>Suppose, for instance, that after many rounds you realize that your opponent, a geologist, chose rock more than 50% of the time. If you’d played paper every round, you would have won more often. Game theorists refer to this painful realization as regret.</p>
<p>Researchers have devised simple learning algorithms that are always guaranteed to leave you with zero regret. Slightly more sophisticated learning algorithms called “no-swap-regret” algorithms also guarantee that whatever your opponent did, you couldn’t have done better by swapping all instances of any move with any other move (say, by playing paper every time you actually played scissors). In 2000, game theorists <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2999445">proved</a> that if you pit two no-swap-regret algorithms against each other in any game, they’ll end up in a specific kind of equilibrium — one that would be the optimal equilibrium if they only played a single round. That’s an attractive property, because single-round games are much simpler than multi-round ones. In particular, threats don’t work because players can’t follow through.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3614407.3643706">2024 paper</a>, <a href="https://sites.northwestern.edu/hartline/">Jason Hartline</a>, a computer scientist at Northwestern University, and two graduate students translated the classic results from the 2000 paper to a model of a competitive market, where players can set new prices every round. In that context, the results implied that dueling no-swap-regret algorithms would always end up with competitive prices when they reached equilibrium. Collusion was impossible.</p>
<p>However, no-swap-regret algorithms aren’t the only pricing game strategies in the world of online marketplaces. So what happens when a no-swap-regret algorithm faces a different benign-looking opponent?</p>
<h2><strong>The Price Is Wrong</strong></h2>
<p>According to game theorists, the best strategy to play against a no-swap-regret algorithm is simple: Start with a specific probability for each possible move, and then choose one move at random every round, no matter what your opponent does. The ideal assignment of probabilities for this “nonresponsive” approach depends on the specific game you’re playing.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2024, Collina and her colleague <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~eshwar/">Eshwar Arunachaleswaran</a> set out to find those optimal probabilities for a two-player pricing game. They found that the best strategy assigned strikingly high probabilities to very high prices, along with lower probabilities for a wide range of lower prices. If you’re playing against a no-swap-regret algorithm, this strange strategy will maximize your profit. “To me, it was a complete surprise,” Arunachaleswaran said.</p>

<p>The construction occurred despite a previous crackdown that resulted in the release of “around 7,000 people from a brutal call center-like system that runs on greed, human trafficking and violence,” the AFP wrote. “Freed workers from Asia, Africa and elsewhere showed AFP journalists the scars and bruises of beatings they said were inflicted by their bosses. They said they had been forced to work around the clock, trawling for victims for a plethora of phone and Internet scams.”</p>
<p>Another AFP <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20251020-myanmar-junta-says-seized-30-starlink-receivers-in-scam-centre-raid">article</a> said “the border region fraud factories are typically run by Chinese criminal syndicates, analysts say, often overseen by Myanmar militias given tacit backing by the Myanmar junta in return for guaranteeing security.”</p>
<p>The Associated Press wrote that “Myanmar is notorious for hosting cyberscam operations responsible for bilking people all over the world. These usually involve gaining victims’ confidence online with romantic ploys and bogus investment pitches. The centers are infamous for recruiting workers from other countries under false pretenses, promising them legitimate jobs and then holding them captive and forcing them to carry out criminal activities.”</p>
<h2>Senator urged Musk to take action</h2>
<p>An <a href="https://www.unodc.org/roseap/uploads/documents/Publications/2024/TOC_Convergence_Report_2024.pdf">October 2024 report</a> by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime described the use of Starlink in fraud operations. About 80 “Starlink satellite dishes linked to cyber-enabled fraud operations” were seized between April and June 2024 in Myanmar and Thailand, the report said. Starlink is prohibited in both countries.</p>
<p>“Despite Starlink use being strictly monitored and, in some cases, restricted through geofencing, organized crime groups appear to have found ways around existing security protocols in order to access the remote high-speed Internet connectivity made possible by this portable technology,” the report said.</p>
<p>In July this year, US Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-NH) urged SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to prevent criminals from using Starlink for scam operations that target Americans.</p>
<p>“While SpaceX has stated that it investigates and deactivates Starlink devices in various contexts, it seemingly has not publicly acknowledged the use of Starlink for scams originating in Southeast Asia—or publicly discussed actions the company has taken in response,” Hassan wrote in a <a href="https://www.hassan.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-hassan-urges-elon-musk-to-block-starlink-access-for-transnational-scammers">letter to Musk</a>. “Scam networks in Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos, however, have apparently continued to use Starlink despite service rules permitting SpaceX to terminate access for fraudulent activity.”</p>
<p>Hassan is the top Democrat on the US Congress Joint Economic Committee, which is reportedly investigating the use of Starlink in the scam operations. Dreyer said last night that SpaceX is committed to “detecting and preventing misuse by bad actors.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">

            
<article id="post-5523">
  
  <div data-hide-featured-media="1"><p><span>We now live in a world where ML workflows (pre-training, post training, etc) are heterogeneous, must contend with hardware failures, are increasingly asynchronous and highly dynamic. Traditionally, PyTorch has relied on an HPC-style&nbsp; multi-controller model, where multiple copies of the same script are launched across different machines, each running its own instance of the application (often referred to as SPMD). ML workflows are becoming more complex: pre-training might combine advanced parallelism with asynchrony and partial failure; while RL models used in post-training require a high degree of dynamism with complex feedback loops.&nbsp; While the logic of these workflows may be relatively straightforward, they are notoriously difficult to implement well in a multi-controller system, where each node must decide how to act based on only a local view of the workflow’s state.</span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://pytorch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1-2.png" alt="" width="1600" height="680" srcset="https://pytorch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1-2.png 1600w, https://pytorch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1-2-300x128.png 300w, https://pytorch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1-2-1024x435.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"></p>
<p><span>We believe that the long-term sustainable way to address this is through a </span><i><span>single controller</span></i><span> programming model, in which a single script orchestrates all distributed resources, making them feel almost local. This architectural shift simplifies distributed programming—your code looks and feels like a single-machine Python program, but can scale across thousands of GPUs. You can directly use Pythonic constructs—classes, functions, loops, tasks, futures—to express complex distributed algorithms.</span></p>
<p><span>We’re excited to introduce </span><b>Monarch</b><span>, a distributed programming framework that brings the simplicity of single-machine PyTorch to entire clusters.</span></p>
<p><span>Monarch lets you program distributed systems the way you’d program a single machine, hiding the complexity of distributed computing:</span></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Program clusters like arrays.</b><span> Monarch organizes hosts, processes, and actors into scalable </span><i><span>meshes</span></i><span> that you can manipulate directly. You can operate on entire meshes (or slices of them) with simple APIs—Monarch handles the distribution and vectorization automatically, so you can think in terms of what you want to compute, not where the code runs.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Progressive fault handling.</b><span> With Monarch, you write your code as if nothing fails. When something does fail, Monarch fails fast by default—stopping the whole program, just like an uncaught exception in a simple local script. Later, you can progressively add fine-grained fault handling exactly where you need it, catching and recovering from failures just like you’d catch exceptions.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Separate control from data.</b><span> Monarch splits control plane (messaging) from data plane (RDMA transfers), enabling direct GPU-to-GPU memory transfers across your cluster. Monarch lets you send commands through one path, while moving data through another, optimized for what each does best.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Distributed tensors that feel local.</b><span> Monarch integrates seamlessly with PyTorch to provide tensors that are sharded across clusters of GPUs. Monarch tensor operations look local but are executed across distributed large clusters, with Monarch handling the complexity of coordinating across thousands of GPUs.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span>Programming Model</span></h3>
<h4><span>Key APIs: Process and Actor Meshes</span></h4>
<p><span>Monarch organizes resources into multidimensional arrays, or </span><b>meshes</b><span>. A </span><b>process mesh</b><span> is an array of processes spread across many hosts; an </span><b>actor mesh</b><span> is an array of actors, each running inside a separate process. Like array programming in NumPy or PyTorch, meshes make it simple to dispatch operations efficiently across large systems.</span></p>
<p><span>At launch, Monarch supports process meshes over GPU clusters—typically one process per GPU—onto which you can spawn actors into actor meshes. For local development, the same meshes can also run on a local development server.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><span>Advanced APIs: Tensor Engine and RDMA Buffer</span></h4>
<p><span>Monarch’s </span><i><span>tensor engine</span></i><span> brings distributed tensors to process meshes. It lets you write PyTorch programs as if the entire cluster of GPUs were attached to the machine running the script. For bulk data movement, Monarch also provides an RDMA buffer API, enabling direct, high-throughput transfers between processes on supported NICs.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://meta-pytorch.org/monarch/generated/examples/getting_started.html"><span>Extensive details</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://meta-pytorch.org/monarch/generated/examples/index.html"><span>more detailed examples</span></a><span> can be found on our </span><a href="https://meta-pytorch.org/monarch/index.html"><span>GitHub page.</span></a></p>
<h4><span>A Simple Example</span></h4>
<p><span>Monarch code imperatively describes how to create processes and actors using a simple Python API:</span></p>
<pre><span>from</span> monarch.actor <span>import</span> Actor, endpoint, this_host

procs = this_host().spawn_procs({<span>"gpus"</span>: <span>8</span>})

<span># define an actor that has one method</span>
<span>class</span> Example(Actor):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@endpoint
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>def</span> say_hello(self, txt):
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>return</span> <span>f"hello {txt}</span>"

<span># spawn the actors</span>
actors = procs.spawn("actors", Example)

# <span>have them say hello</span>
hello_future = actors.say_hello.call("world")

<span># print out the results</span>
<span>print</span>(hello_future.get())

</pre>
<p><span>In the above example, we define an Actor called “Example” that is deployed on 8 GPUs on the local host. The controller then invokes this example across the host and waits for their response. The actors can expose a variety of interfaces.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><span>Slicing Meshes</span></h4>
<p><span>We express broadcasted communication by organizing actors into a Mesh – a multidimensional container with named dimensions. For instance, a cluster might have dimensions {“hosts”: 32, “gpus”: 8}. Dimension names are normally things like “hosts”, indexing across the hosts in a cluster, or “gpus”, indexing across things in a machine.</span></p>
<pre><span>from</span> <span>monarch.actor</span> <span>import</span> <span>Actor,</span> <span>endpoint,</span> <span>this_host</span>

<span>procs</span> <span>=</span> <span>this_host().spawn_procs({</span><span>"gpus"</span><span>:</span> <span>8</span><span>})</span>

<span># define an actor that has two methods</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Example(Actor):</span>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>@endpoint</span>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>def</span> <span>say_hello(self,</span> <span>txt):</span>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>return</span> <span><span>f"hello {txt}</span>"</span>

<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>@endpoint</span>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>def</span> <span>say_bye(self,</span> <span>txt):</span>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>return</span> <span><span>f"goodbye {txt}</span>"</span>

<span># spawn the actors</span>
<span>actors</span> <span>=</span> <span>procs.spawn(</span><span>"actors"</span><span>,</span> <span>Example)</span>

<span># have half of them say hello</span>
<span>hello_fut</span> <span>=</span> <span>actors.</span><span>slice</span><span>(gpus=</span><span>slice</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>)).say_hello.call(</span><span>"world"</span><span>)</span>

<span># the other half say good bye</span>
<span>bye_fut</span> <span>=</span> <span>actors.</span><span>slice</span><span>(gpus=</span><span>slice</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>,</span><span>8</span><span>)).say_bye.call(</span><span>"world"</span><span>)</span>

<span>print</span><span>(hello_fut.get())</span>
<span>print</span><span>(bye_fut.get())

</span></pre>
<h4><span>Fault Recovery</span></h4>
<p><span>Users can express distributed programs that can error through pythonic try, except blocks. Complex fault detection and fault recovery schemes can be built on top of these primitives. The following showcases handling a simple runtime Exception in a remote actor.</span></p>
<pre><span>from</span> <span>monarch.actor</span> <span>import</span> <span>Actor,</span> <span>endpoint,</span> <span>this_host</span>

<span>procs</span> <span>=</span> <span>this_host().spawn_procs({</span><span>"gpus"</span><span>:</span> <span>8</span><span>})</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Example(Actor):</span>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>@endpoint</span>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>def</span> <span>say_hello(self,</span> <span>txt):</span>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>return</span> <span>f"hello {txt}"</span>

<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>@endpoint</span>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>def</span> <span>say_bye(self,</span> <span>txt):</span>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>raise</span> <span>Exception(</span><span>"saying bye is hard"</span><span>)</span>

<span>actors</span> <span>=</span> <span>procs.spawn(</span><span>"actors"</span><span>,</span> <span>Example)</span>
<span>hello_fut</span> <span>=</span> <span>actors.</span><span>slice</span><span>(gpus=</span><span>slice</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span>4</span><span>)).say_hello.call(</span><span>"world"</span><span>)</span>
<span>bye_fut</span> <span>=</span> <span>actors.</span><span>slice</span><span>(gpus=</span><span>slice</span><span>(</span><span>4</span><span>,</span><span>8</span><span>)).say_bye.call(</span><span>"world"</span><span>)</span>

<span>try</span><span>:</span>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>print</span><span>(hello_fut.get())</span>
<span>except</span><span>:</span>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"couldn't say hello"</span><span>)</span>

<span>try</span><span>:</span>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>print</span><span>(bye_fut.get())</span>
<span>except</span> <span>Exception:</span>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>"got an exception saying bye"</span><span>)

</span></pre>
<p><span>See “Case Study 2: Fault Tolerance in Large Scale Pre Training” for a more realistic use case.</span></p>
<h2><span>The Monarch Backend</span></h2>
<p><span>Monarch is split into a Python-based </span><i><span>frontend</span></i><span>, and a backend implemented in Rust. Python is the lingua franca of machine learning, and our Python frontend APIs allow users to seamlessly integrate with existing code and libraries (like PyTorch!), and to use Monarch with interactive computing tools like Jupyter notebooks. Our Rust-based backend facilitates our performance, scale, and robustness&nbsp; — we amply use Rust’s </span><i><span>fearless concurrency</span></i><span> in Monarch’s implementation.</span></p>
<h3><span>Hyperactor and hyperactor_mesh</span></h3>
<p><span>At the bottom of the stack is a Rust-based actor framework called </span><a href="https://github.com/meta-pytorch/monarch/tree/main/hyperactor"><i><span>hyperactor</span></i></a><span>. Hyperactor is a low-level distributed actor system, focused on performant message passing and robust supervision. </span><i><span>hyperactor_mesh</span></i><span> is built on top of hyperactor, and combines its various components into an efficient “vectorized” actor implementation. Hyperactor_mesh is oriented towards providing actor operations cheaply over large </span><i><span>meshes</span></i><span> of actors.</span></p>
<p><span>Monarch’s core Python APIs, in turn, are fairly thin wrappers around hyperactor_mesh.</span></p>
<h3><span>Scalable messaging</span></h3>
<p><span>Everything in Monarch relies on </span><i><span>scalable messaging</span></i><span>: the core APIs supporting </span><i><span>casting</span></i><span> messages to large meshes of actors. Hyperactor achieves this through two mechanisms: multicast trees and multipart messaging.</span></p>
<p><span>First, in order to support multicasting, Hyperactor sets up multicast trees to distribute messages. When a message is cast, it is first sent to some initial nodes, which then forward copies of the message to a set of its children, and so on, until the message has been fully distributed throughout the mesh. This lets us avoid single-host bottlenecks, effectively using the whole mesh as a distributed cluster for message forwarding. (Cite scalability numbers here.)</span></p>
<p><span>Second, we ensure that the control plane is never in the critical path of data delivery. For example, we use multipart messaging to avoid copying, to enable sharing data across high-fanout sends (such as those that occur in our multicast trees), and materialize into efficient, vectorized writes managed by the OS.</span></p>
<h2><span>Case Studies</span></h2>
<p><span>We believe that this general purpose API and its native integration with PyTorch will unlock the next generation of AI applications at scale and the more complex orchestration requirements that they present.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Case Study 1: Reinforcement Learning</span></h3>
<p><span>Reinforcement learning has been critical to the current generation of frontier models. RL enables models to do deep research, perform tasks in an environment and solve challenging problems such as math and code. For a deeper dive, we recommend this </span><a href="https://pytorch.org/blog/a-primer-on-llm-post-training/?ajs_aid=57910bf1-d592-4619-a7d5-295ab7d39433"><span>post</span></a><span> for a deeper dive into the topics.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In order to train a reasoning model (see figure below), generator processes produce prompts from the reasoning model specializing in a specific domain (say, programming code generation). The generator uses these prompts (an incomplete coding problem statement) to derive a set of solutions or trajectories (executable code in this example) often interacting with the world through tools (compiler) and environments. Reward pipelines evaluate these solutions and come up with scores. These scores and rewards are used to train the same model whose weights are then transferred back to the systems that generated the prompt responses.</span></p>
<p><span>This constitutes a single training loop! As illustrated in the figure below, this is effectively a real-time pipeline of a number of heterogeneous computations </span><b><i>within a training loop</i></b><span> that may have to be orchestrated and scaled individually.</span></p>
<p><span><img decoding="async" src="https://pytorch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/unnamed-2.png" alt="" width="1600" height="985" srcset="https://pytorch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/unnamed-2.png 1600w, https://pytorch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/unnamed-2-300x185.png 300w, https://pytorch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/unnamed-2-1024x630.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"></span></p>
<p><span>When implementing the RL example above in Monarch, each component — generator, trainer, inference engine, reward pipeline — might be represented by a mesh: a mesh of generators, a mesh of trainers, a mesh of inference nodes, a mesh of reward pipelines. (The figure above shows a simplistic example with only two meshes: generator and trainer).</span></p>
<p><span>The training script then uses these meshes to orchestrate the overall flow of the job: telling the generator mesh to start working from a new batch of prompts, passing the data to the training mesh when they are done, and updating the inference mesh when a new model snapshot is ready. The orchestrator is written as an ordinary Python program, calling methods on meshes and passing data between them. Because Monarch supports remote memory transfers (RDMA) natively, the actual data is transferred directly between members of meshes (just like you might copy a tensor from one GPU to another), enabling efficient and scalable workflows.</span></p>
<h4><span>VERL</span></h4>
<p><span>Volcano Engine Reinforcement Learning (</span><a href="https://github.com/volcengine/verl"><span>VERL</span></a><span>) is a widely used Reinforcement Learning framework in the industry today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We integrated Monarch with VERL as a proof-of-concept and post-trained the </span><a href="https://huggingface.co/open-r1/Qwen2.5-Math-7B-RoPE-300k"><span>Qwen-2.5-7B math model</span></a><span> using GRPO on a curated math dataset and evaluated it on the AIME 2024 benchmark. We trained for 500+ training steps on H200 GPUs using </span><a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM"><span>Megatron-LM</span></a><span> scaling progressively from 16, 64, 1024 to 2048 GPUs. The runs were stable and yielded good numerical parity with existing options, demonstrating that Monarch can orchestrate existing RL frameworks.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We are actively working on open-sourcing this integration to allow future users to evaluate Monarch as an option in their VERL jobs.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://pytorch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/3-3.png" alt="" width="984" height="584" srcset="https://pytorch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/3-3.png 984w, https://pytorch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/3-3-300x178.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 984px) 100vw, 984px"></p>
<h4><span>TorchForge</span></h4>
<p><span>TorchForge represents a different approach: a pytorch native RL framework designed from the ground up with Monarch primitives.</span></p>
<p><span>TorchForge’s goal is to let researchers express RL algorithms as naturally as pseudocode, while Monarch handles the distributed complexity underneath. The result is code that looks like this:</span></p>
<pre><span>async def </span>continuous_rollouts():
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>while</span> True:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prompt, target = <span>await</span> dataloader.sample.route()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;response = <span>await</span> policy.generate.route(prompt)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reward = <span>await</span>&nbsp;reward.evaluate_response.route(prompt, response.text, target)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>await</span>&nbsp;replay_buffer.add.route(Episode(...))</pre>
<p><span>No distributed coordination code, no retry logic, just RL written in Python.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><span>Building on Monarch: Services and TorchStore</span></h4>
<p><span>This clean API is possible because torchforge builds two key abstractions on Monarch’s primitives:</span></p>
<p><span>“</span><b>Services</b><span>” wrap Monarch ActorMeshes with RL-specific patterns. They leverage Monarch’s fault tolerance, resource allocation, and mailbox system, while adding patterns like load-balanced routing (`.route()`), parallel broadcasts (`.fanout()`), and sticky sessions for stateful operations.</span></p>
<pre><span># A service is a managed group of ActorMeshes with routing primitives</span>
<span>policy</span> <span>=</span> <span>PolicyActor.options(</span>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>procs=</span><span>8</span><span>,</span> <span>with_gpus=True,</span> <span>num_replicas=</span><span>16</span> <span># Creates 16 replicas, each with 8 GPUs</span>
<span>).as_service()</span>

<span># Services provide RL-friendly adverbs built on Monarch actors</span>
<span>response</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>policy.generate.route(prompt)</span><span> &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span># Load-balanced routing</span>
<span>await</span> <span>policy.update_weights.fanout(version)</span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span>#</span> <span>Parallel</span> <span>broadcast</span><span>&nbsp;

</span></pre>
<p><b>TorchStore</b><span> is a distributed key-value store for PyTorch tensors that handles weight synchronization between training and inference. Built on Monarch’s RDMA primitives and single-controller design, it provides simple DTensor APIs while efficiently resharding weights on the fly – critical for off-policy RL where training and inference use different layouts.</span></p>
<p><span>These abstractions demonstrate Monarch’s composability: torchforge uses Monarch’s primitives (actors, RDMA, fault tolerance) as building blocks to create RL-specific infrastructure. The resulting framework handles coordination complexity at the infrastructure layer, letting researchers focus on algorithms.</span></p>
<p><span>For detailed examples of Forge’s APIs, component integration, and design philosophy, see our <a href="https://pytorch.org/blog/introducing-torchforge/">torchforge</a> blog post.</span></p>
<h3><span>Case Study 2: Fault Tolerance in Large Scale Pre Training</span></h3>
<p><span>Hardware and software failures are common and frequent at scale. For example, in </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21783"><span>our Llama3 training runs</span></a><span> we experienced 419 interruptions across a 54 day training window for a 16k GPU training job. This averages to about one failure every 3 hours. If we project this out to 10s of thousands of GPUs, this represents a failure once every hour or more frequently. Restarting the entire job for each of these failures will reduce the effective training time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A solution is to use methods to further leverage distributed training through methods to make the numerics of the model more tolerant of having the various groups run more asynchronously. For example, </span><a href="https://pytorch.org/blog/fault-tolerant-llama-training-with-2000-synthetic-failures-every-15-seconds-and-no-checkpoints-on-crusoe-l40s/"><span>TorchFT</span></a><span>, released from PyTorch, provides a way to withstand failures of GPUs and allow the training to continue. One strategy is to use Hybrid Sharded Data Parallelism that combines fault tolerant DDP with FSDP v2 and PP. On failure we use </span><a href="https://pytorch.org/blog/torchcomms/"><span>torchcomms</span></a><span> to gracefully handle errors and UI training on the next batch without downtime. This isolates failures to a single “replica group” and we can continue training with a subset of the original job.</span></p>
<p><span>Monarch </span><a href="https://github.com/meta-pytorch/torchft/tree/main/examples/monarch"><span>integrates</span></a><span> with </span><a href="https://github.com/meta-pytorch/torchft"><span>TorchFT</span></a><span>. Monarch centralizes the control plane into a single-controller model. Monarch uses its fault detection primitives to detect failures, and upon detection, can spin up new logical replica groups (Monarch Meshes) to join training once initialized. TorchFT’s Lighthouse server acts as a Monarch actor. Monarch provides configurable recovery strategies based on failure type. On faults, the controller first attempts fast, process‑level restarts within the existing allocation and only escalates to job reallocation when necessary, while TorchFT keeps healthy replicas stepping so progress continues during recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>We ran this code on a 30 node (240 H100s) Coreweave cluster, using the SLURM scheduler to train Qwen3-32B using torchtitan and TorchFT. We injected 100 injected failures every 3 minutes across multiple failure modes (segfaults, process kills, NCCL abort, host eviction, GIL deadlock). Monarch allows for configurable recovery strategies based on failure type — we observed this to be 60% faster by avoiding unnecessary job rescheduling (relative to full SLURM job restarts). We see 90s avg recovery for process failures and 2.5min avg recovery machine failures. For more details, see the </span><a href="https://github.com/meta-pytorch/torchft/tree/main/examples/monarch"><span>README</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<h3><span>Case Study 3: Interactive Debugging with a Large GPU cluster&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span>The actor framework is not just limited to large scale orchestration of complex jobs. It enables the ability to seamlessly debug complex, multi-GPU computations interactively. This capability represents a fundamental shift from traditional batch-oriented debugging to real-time, exploratory problem-solving that matches the scale and complexity of contemporary AI systems.</span></p>
<p><span>Traditional debugging workflows break down when confronted with the realities of modern ML systems. A model that trains perfectly on a single GPU may exhibit subtle race conditions, deadlocks, memory fragmentation, or communication bottlenecks when scaled across dozens of accelerators.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Monarch provides an interactive developer experience. With a local jupyter notebook, a user can drive a cluster as a Monarch mesh.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span>Monarch + Lightning AI Notebook</span></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://pytorch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/5-1.png" alt="" width="1600" height="990" srcset="https://pytorch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/5-1.png 1600w, https://pytorch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/5-1-300x186.png 300w, https://pytorch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/5-1-1024x634.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px"></p>
<p><span>See Monarch in action as we launch a 256-GPU training job from a single Studio notebook, powered by TorchTitan. Experience seamless scaling, persistent resources, and interactive debugging — all in one single Notebook. The figure above shows this schema.&nbsp; Also, see our </span><a href="https://pytorch.org/blog/integration-idea-monarch/"><span>Monarch-Lightning blog post</span></a><span>. In this example, the traditional SPMD TorchTitan workload is encapsulated as an Actor within Monarch, allowing users to pre-train large language models (such as Llama-3 and Llama-4) interactively from a Studio Notebook.</span></p>
<p><span>Monarch enables you to reserve and maintain compute resources directly from your local Studio Notebook in lightning. Even if your notebook session is interrupted or code disconnects, your cluster allocation remains active through Multi-Machine Training (MMT). This persistence of the process allocator allows you to iterate, experiment, and resume work seamlessly, reducing manual intervention and making the notebook a reliable control center for distributed training tasks.</span></p>
<p><span>Using Monarch’s Actor model, you can define and launch the Titan Trainer as an Actor on a process mesh, scaling your training jobs to hundreds of GPUs – all from within the Studio notebook. Monarch handles the orchestration, code and file sharing, and log collection, so you can reconfigure and relaunch jobs quickly. Logs and metrics are available directly in the notebook, as well as through external tools like Litlogger and WandB, making it easy to monitor and manage large-scale training.</span></p>
<p><span>Monarch brings interactive debugging to distributed training. You can set Python breakpoints in your Actor code, inspect running processes, and attach to specific actors for real-time troubleshooting – all from the notebook interface. After training, you can modify configurations or define new actors and relaunch jobs on the same resources without waiting for new allocations. This dynamic workflow accelerates experimentation and provides deep insight into your distributed training runs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The code snippet in the </span><a href="https://pytorch.org/blog/integration-idea-monarch/"><span>Monarch-Lightning blog post</span></a><span>&nbsp; shows the sample Lightning studio notebook for Monarch to pre-train the Llama-3.1 – 8B model using TorchTitan on 256 GPUs.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://lemmings.info/c64-blood-money/">https://lemmings.info/c64-blood-money/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45679638">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                
<p>While I still remember the details, I thought I’d go over my port of <strong>Blood Money</strong> to the <strong>C64</strong>. It had some really cool bits in it, and I had great fun doing it. Some parts make me cringe a little now, so it’d be interesting to revive it, and see if I can get it building again – or at the very least, go over the code again…</p>



<p>One thing that DID bug me, even back then, was the crappy starfield. It was just some characters stuck in the map, and it sucked.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="650" height="359" src="https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image.png 650w, https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-300x166.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"></figure></div>


<p>So what were the main components?</p>



<ol>
<li>Multi-Directional scrolling</li>



<li>Sprite Multiplexor</li>



<li>Scripting</li>



<li>Sprite compression</li>



<li>Turrets</li>



<li>Character sprites</li>



<li>Bullets / Weapons</li>



<li>Collision</li>



<li>Shop</li>



<li>Front End</li>
</ol>



<p>These are the major parts and we’ll take them one at a time. Before that, I want to briefly look over the code, and talk about the devkit – <strong>PDS</strong>. Programmers Development System. This was a lovely system, and one I’m sad I didn’t find while raiding the <strong>DMA </strong>Offices.</p>



<p>The <strong>PDS</strong> system consisted of a <strong>PC ISA</strong> card, and a <strong>C64</strong> cartridge. The ISA card was common for all systems, while the target cartridge was custom for each platform.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="739" src="https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-1-1024x739.png" alt="" srcset="https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-1-1024x739.png 1024w, https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-1-300x216.png 300w, https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-1-768x554.png 768w, https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-1-1536x1108.png 1536w, https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-1.png 1788w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>As I can’t find a <strong>C64 </strong>image, here’s the <strong>Sam Coupé</strong> (<strong>Z80</strong>) one to show what it might look like.<br>EDIT: So with the <strong>RMC Cave</strong> opening up a “<strong>Dev Den</strong>“, Jason who is running that part, had a <strong>C64</strong> one and it turns out there isn’t an interface, just a user port connector. This makes sense as the <strong>C64 </strong>already has everything it needs to read/write bytes in parallel.</p>



<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.worldofsam.org/sites/default/files/2018-08/1930902_10155032479666879_3329198604205518881_n.jpg" alt="PDS development system | World of SAM"></p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="400" height="300" src="https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-2.png 400w, https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-2-300x225.png 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></figure></div>


<p>This is the <strong>Z80 </strong>program, but the <strong>6502 </strong>one was the same. It consisted of a built in text editor/assembler/debugger. The text editor could hold 8 files up to a maximum of <strong>32k </strong>each, though you could include as many files as you like. It assembled before your finger left the key, and squired down in under a second. This was a massive speed boost from the 20 minutes I sometimes spent waiting on the <strong>C64</strong> to disk assemble using a fast parallel disk interface.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="896" height="973" src="https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-3.png 896w, https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-3-276x300.png 276w, https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-3-768x834.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 896px) 100vw, 896px"></figure></div>


<p>The other good thing about <strong>PDS</strong>, is it remembers the start date, and the last time you touched it – which is very cool and handy. So I started this on 7th of August 1989…. though, this probably isn’t right. This was the month the office opened, and I was still working on <strong>Ballistix </strong>at this point. However, I did create a <strong>C64 </strong>framework, and then probably based the game off that. The date below 2/10/89 looks better, and the end date looks about right 25/4/90. Games back then took about 6 months, so this also fits.</p>



<p>So in the main code of all my <strong>C64 </strong>games, I setup equates (constants), and zero page and normal variables. On the <strong>6502 </strong>there are <strong>256 </strong>bytes of fast zero page, <strong>2</strong> are taken with <strong>I/O </strong>control, and the rest are available for use. Zero page instructions typically take <strong>1</strong> cycle less to operate, so are highly desirable for critical code optimisations.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="758" height="965" src="https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-4.png 758w, https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-4-236x300.png 236w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 758px) 100vw, 758px"></figure></div>


<p>These are some of the constants. At the top you can see the big ticket items – memory map etc. There’s a couple of interesting items here – <strong>Charmasks</strong>/<strong>Shipmasks</strong>, and <strong>down_load</strong>. The collision in <strong>Blood Money</strong> wasn’t character based, it was bitmap based. I actually read the background tiles, and then masked whatever frame of the ship was active onto these characters. This was pretty slow, but allowed proper collision to the background – something that was vital in later levels. I’ll discuss this mode later of course…</p>



<p><strong>down_load</strong> – this was where the debugger/downloader code lived. Whenever the <strong>C64 </strong>hit a <strong>BRK </strong>instruction, I would detect this in the <strong>IRQ </strong>it generated, and jumped to the <strong>PDS </strong>debugger code.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="710" height="1009" src="https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-5.png 710w, https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-5-211x300.png 211w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px"></figure></div>


<p>This is how I allocated Zero Page variables. Prior to having good macros, I’d have to work these out manually, but now I was able to simple set a name and how many bytes I wanted, and the label would be set. I still use this method for variable allocation when need be – it’s really useful.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="593" height="1024" src="https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-7.png" alt="" srcset="https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-7.png 593w, https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-7-174x300.png 174w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px"></figure></div>


<p>I use the same method for sprite variable allocation. Have to say… this is a lot of variables for each sprite – oh well….</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="715" height="1024" src="https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-8-715x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-8-715x1024.png 715w, https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-8-210x300.png 210w, https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-8.png 718w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 715px) 100vw, 715px"></figure></div>


<p>And this is where I defined general variables, and player structure. There’s <strong>2</strong> of everything as <strong>Blood Money</strong> is a simultaneous <strong>2</strong> player game. This really effected the multiplexor – but more on that later….</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="781" height="656" src="https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-9.png" alt="" srcset="https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-9.png 781w, https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-9-300x252.png 300w, https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-9-768x645.png 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 781px) 100vw, 781px"></figure></div>


<p>Lastly for today, is the start up code, we take over everything and nuke stack and zero page, flick out <strong>ROMs </strong>etc and setup <strong>IRQs</strong> – the usual…</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="558" height="1024" src="https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-10-558x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-10-558x1024.png 558w, https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-10-164x300.png 164w, https://lemmings.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-10.png 561w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px"></figure></div>


<p>The <strong>IRQs</strong> in <strong>Blood Money</strong> are complicated, and heavily tied to the multiplexor, so I’ll talk about that next time…..</p>



<p>Also just to say…. as this was just my second game, and only a couple of months after the office opened, I’m amazed at the level of commenting in the source! 😂</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>Radio communications play a key role in modern electronics, but to a hobbyist, the underlying theory is hard to parse. We get the general idea, of course: we know about frequencies and can probably explain the difference between amplitude modulation and frequency modulation. Yet, most of us find it difficult to articulate what makes a good antenna, or how a receiver can tune in to a specific frequency and ignore everything else.</p><p>In today’s article, I’m hoping to provide an introduction to radio that’s free of ham jargon and advanced math. To do so, I’m leaning on the concepts discussed in three earlier articles on this blog:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/primer-core-concepts-in-electronic" rel="">Core concepts in electronic circuits</a><span>,</span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/signal-reflections-in-electronic" rel="">Signal propagation delays and signal reflections</a><span>,</span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/not-so-fast-mr-fourier" rel="">Frequency domain analysis with DFT and DCT</a><span>.</span></p></li></ul><p>If you’re rusty on any of the above, I recommend jogging your memory first. </p><p>If you’re familiar with the basics of electronics, a simple way to learn about antennas is to imagine a charged capacitor that’s being pulled apart until its internal electric field spills into the surrounding space. This would be a feat of strength, but bear with me for a while:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!byPP!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dffa9f1-4fe0-437e-83ae-9410f24fa886_5181x3080.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!byPP!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dffa9f1-4fe0-437e-83ae-9410f24fa886_5181x3080.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!byPP!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dffa9f1-4fe0-437e-83ae-9410f24fa886_5181x3080.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!byPP!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dffa9f1-4fe0-437e-83ae-9410f24fa886_5181x3080.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!byPP!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dffa9f1-4fe0-437e-83ae-9410f24fa886_5181x3080.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!byPP!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dffa9f1-4fe0-437e-83ae-9410f24fa886_5181x3080.png" width="1456" height="866" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8dffa9f1-4fe0-437e-83ae-9410f24fa886_5181x3080.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:866,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:678599,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://lcamtuf.substack.com/i/142762684?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dffa9f1-4fe0-437e-83ae-9410f24fa886_5181x3080.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!byPP!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dffa9f1-4fe0-437e-83ae-9410f24fa886_5181x3080.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!byPP!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dffa9f1-4fe0-437e-83ae-9410f24fa886_5181x3080.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!byPP!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dffa9f1-4fe0-437e-83ae-9410f24fa886_5181x3080.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!byPP!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8dffa9f1-4fe0-437e-83ae-9410f24fa886_5181x3080.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>Turning a capacitor into a terrible antenna.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>Electric fields can be visualized by plotting the paths of hypothetical positively-charged particles placed in the vicinity.

But in our new scenario, if the field is changing rapidly, then on the account of relativity, we can no longer directly recover the energy from the ripples that are getting away at the speed of light. That energy can only be transferred to downstream charges that may begin to move back and forth as they “swim” through the gradients of the incoming field.</p><p>It should be fairly evident that the amount of radiated energy increases with the amount of charges shuttled back and forth between the plates — the intensity of each ripple — and with the number of transitions per second (i.e., with the signal’s frequency).</p><p>A perfectly uniform waveform is still not useful for communications, but we can encode information by slightly altering the wave’s characteristics over time — for example, tweaking its amplitude. And if we do it this way, then owing to a clever trick we’ll discuss a bit later, simultaneous transmissions on different frequencies can be told apart on the receiving end.</p><p>But first, it’s time for a reality check: if we go back to our dismantled capacitor and hook it up to a voltage-based signal source, the setup won’t actually do squat. When we pulled the plates apart, we greatly reduced the device’s capacitance, so we’re essentially looking at an open circuit; a pretty high voltage would be needed to shuffle a decent number of electrons back and forth. Without this motion — i.e., without a healthy current — the relativistic ripples pack very little punch.</p><p><span>The most elegant solution to this problem is known as a half-wavelength (“half-wave”) dipole antenna: two rods along a common axis, driven by a sinusoidal signal fed at the center, each rod exactly ¼ wavelength long.

The antenna experiences back-and-forth currents between its poles at the transmitter’s working frequency. Further, if the antenna’s length is chosen right, there should be constructive interference of the induced currents too, eventually resulting in much higher signal amplitudes.</p><p><span>The illustration also offers an intuitive explanation of something I didn’t mention before: that dipoles longer than ½ wavelength are more directional. If you look at </span><em>receiver B </em><span>on the left, it’s clear that even a minor tilt of a long dipole results in the ends being exposed to opposing electric fields, yielding little or no net current flow.</span></p><p>Not all antennas are dipoles, but most operate in a similar way. Monopoles are just a minor riff on the theme, trading one half of the antenna for a connection to the ground. More complex shapes usually crop up as a way to maintain resonance at multiple frequencies or to fine-tune directionality. You might also bump into antenna arrays; these devices exploit patterns of constructive and destructive interference between digitally-controlled signals to flexibly focus on a particular spot.</p><p><span>Compared to antenna design, signal modulation is a piece of cake. There’s </span><em>amplitude modulation</em><span> (AM), which changes the carrier’s amplitude to encode information; there’s </span><em>frequency modulation</em><span> (FM), which shifts the carrier up and down; and there’s </span><em>phase modulation</em><span> (PM) — well, you get the drift. We also have </span><em>quadrature amplitude modulation</em><span> (QAM), which robustly conveys information via the </span><em>relative</em><span> amplitude of two signals with phases offset by 90°.</span></p><p>In any case, once the carrier signal is isolated, demodulation is typically pretty easy to figure out. For AM, the process can be as simple as rectifying the amplified sine wave with a diode, and then running it through a lowpass filter to obtain the audio-frequency envelope. Other modulations are a bit more involved — FM and PM benefit from phase-locked loops to detect shifts — but most of it isn’t rocket surgery.</p><p>Still, there are two finer points to bring up about modulation. First, the rate of change of the carrier signal must be much lower than its running frequency. If the modulation is too rapid, you end up obliterating the carrier wave and turning it into wideband noise. The only reason why resonant antennas and conventional radio tuning circuits work at all is that almost nothing changes cycle-to-cycle — so in the local view, you’re dealing with a nearly-perfect, constant-frequency sine.</p><p><span>The other point is that counterintuitively, </span><em>all</em><span> modulation is frequency modulation. Intuitively, AM might feel like a clever zero-bandwidth hack: after all, we’re just changing the amplitude of a fixed-frequency sine wave, so what’s stopping us from putting any number of AM transmissions a fraction of a hertz apart?</span></p><p><span>Well, no dice: recall from the </span><a href="https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/not-so-fast-mr-fourier" rel="">discussion of the Fourier transform</a><span> that any deviation from a steady sine introduces momentary artifacts in the frequency domain. The scale of the artifacts is proportional to the rate of change; AM is not special and takes up frequency bandwidth too. To illustrate, here’s a capture of a local AM station; we see audio modulation artifacts spanning multiple kHz on both sides of the carrier frequency:</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8LIJ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F816eaccd-380a-4c31-8faf-b7f653817b7a_1800x1201.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8LIJ!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F816eaccd-380a-4c31-8faf-b7f653817b7a_1800x1201.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8LIJ!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F816eaccd-380a-4c31-8faf-b7f653817b7a_1800x1201.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8LIJ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F816eaccd-380a-4c31-8faf-b7f653817b7a_1800x1201.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8LIJ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F816eaccd-380a-4c31-8faf-b7f653817b7a_1800x1201.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8LIJ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F816eaccd-380a-4c31-8faf-b7f653817b7a_1800x1201.jpeg" width="1456" height="971" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/816eaccd-380a-4c31-8faf-b7f653817b7a_1800x1201.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1682879,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8LIJ!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F816eaccd-380a-4c31-8faf-b7f653817b7a_1800x1201.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8LIJ!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F816eaccd-380a-4c31-8faf-b7f653817b7a_1800x1201.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8LIJ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F816eaccd-380a-4c31-8faf-b7f653817b7a_1800x1201.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8LIJ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F816eaccd-380a-4c31-8faf-b7f653817b7a_1800x1201.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>The talk of the town.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>We’ll have a proof of this in a moment. But broadly speaking, all types of modulation boil down to taking a low-frequency signal band — such as audio — and transposing it in one way or another to a similarly-sized slice of the spectrum in the vicinity of some chosen center frequency. The difference is the construction method, not the result.</p><p><span>At this point, some readers might object: the Fourier transform surely isn’t the only way to think about the frequency spectrum; just because we see halos on an FFT plot, it doesn’t mean they’re </span><em>really </em><span>real. In an epistemological sense, this </span><a href="https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/is-the-frequency-domain-a-real-place" rel="">might be right</a><span>. But as it happens, radio receivers work by doing something that walks and quacks </span><em>a lot</em><span> like Fourier…</span></p><p>The basic operation of almost every radio receiver boils down to mixing (multiplying) the amplified antenna signal with a sine wave of a chosen frequency. As foreshadowed just moments ago, this is eerily similar to how Fourier-adjacent transforms deconstruct complex signals into individual frequency components.</p><p>From the discussion of the discrete cosine transform (DCT) in the earlier article, you might remember that if a matching frequency is present in the input signal, the multiplication yields a waveform with a DC bias proportional to the magnitude of that frequency component. For all other input frequencies, the resulting waveforms average out to zero, if analyzed on a sufficiently long timescale.</p><p><span>In the aforementioned article, we informally noted that the resulting composite waveforms have shorter periods if the original frequencies are far apart, and longer periods if the frequencies are close.

By author.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>It’s probably best to zoom in and just walk through the picture, but if you need additional hints, the following text narrative should help. Otherwise, just skip ahead to the paragraph starting with the “fast forward” pictogram (⏩).</p><p><span>Proof narrative: we start with two given angles, </span><em>α</em><span> and </span><em>β</em><span>. </span><strong>Panel 1 (top left): </strong><span>we construct a right-angle triangle (#1), which has an angle of </span><em>α </em><span>and a hypotenuse equal to 1. Next, we calculate the length of the adjacent of that triangle using basic trigonometry — </span><em>1 × cos(α).</em><span> </span><strong>Panel 2 (top right):</strong><span> we slide a second triangle underneath #1. The new triangle (#2) has an angle of </span><em>β</em><span> and a hypotenuse of the same length as the adjacent of triangle #1: </span><em>cos(α)</em><span>; this makes the adjacent of #2 equal to </span><em>cos(α) × cos(β)</em><span>.</span></p><p><strong>Panel 3 (middle left):</strong><span> we add triangle #3, placing it on top of the other triangles. The new triangle inherits a hypotenuse of 1 from triangle #1, and has a combined angle of </span><em>α+β </em><span>as a consequence of being partly inscribed inside #1 and #2</span><em>.</em><span> It follows that its adjacent is </span><em>1 × cos(α + β)</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>The bottom edge of the combined figure has a length equal to the known adjacent of #2: </span><em>cos(α) × cos(β)</em><span>. Alternatively, the length can be expressed as the adjacent of #3 – </span><em>cos(α + β) </em><span>– plus some unknown segment, </span><em>x</em><span>. </span></p><p><span>We solve for that mystery segment by looking a new helper triangle (#4). </span><strong>Panel 4 (middle right):</strong><span> we find the top angle of that triangle, which works out to </span><em>β</em><span>. </span><strong>Panel 5 (bottom):</strong><span> a quick analysis shows that </span><em>x</em><span> is equal to </span><em>sin(α) × sin(β)</em><span>. Putting it all together, we obtain the following angle sum identity:</span></p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\(cos(\alpha + \beta) = cos(\alpha) \cdot cos(\beta) - sin(\alpha) \cdot sin(\beta)\)</span></p></div><p><span>⏩ The identity for </span><em>cos(α + β)</em><span> can be trivially extended to </span><em>cos(α - β)</em><span>, because subtraction is the same as adding a negative number:</span></p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\(\begin{array}{c}
cos(\alpha - \beta)  = cos(\alpha + (-\beta)) \\
= cos(\alpha)\cdot \underbrace{cos(-\beta)}_{=\  cos(\beta)} - sin(\alpha) \cdot \underbrace{sin(-\beta)}_{= \ -sin(\beta)} \\
\\
\textrm{Formula after substitutions:} \\
cos(\alpha - \beta) 
= cos(\alpha) \cdot cos(\beta) + sin(\alpha) \cdot sin(\beta)
\end{array}\)</span></p></div><p><span>Now that we have these two formulas, let’s see what happens if we subtract </span><em>cos(α + β)</em><span> from </span><em>cos(α – β)</em><span>:</span></p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\(\begin{array}{c}
cos(\alpha - \beta) - cos(\alpha + \beta)\\
= \cancel{cos(\alpha) \cdot cos(\beta)} + sin(a) \cdot sin(\beta) \\
 - \cancel{cos(\alpha) \cdot cos(\beta)} + sin(\alpha) \cdot sin(\beta) \\
= 2 \cdot sin(\alpha) \cdot sin(\beta)
\end{array}\)</span></p></div><p><span>Next, divide both sides by two and flip the expression around; this nets us a formula that equates the product of (i.e., the mix of) two sine frequencies to the sum of two independent cosines running at </span><em><span>|f</span><sub>1</sub><span> - f</span><sub>2</sub><span>|</span></em><span> and </span><em><span>f</span><sub>1</sub><span> + f</span><sub>2</sub></em><span>:</span></p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\(sin(\alpha) \cdot sin(\beta) = \frac{cos(\alpha - \beta)  - cos(\alpha + \beta)}{2}\)</span></p></div><p>In other words, it describes the exact phenomenon we’ve been looking at.</p><p>We don’t even need to believe in trigonometry. A closely-related phenomenon has been known to musicians for ages: when you simultaneously play two very similar tones, you end up with an unexpected, slowly-pulsating “beat frequency”. Here’s a demonstration of a 5 Hz beat produced by combining 400 Hz and 405 Hz:</p><div id="vimeo-926723062" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;926723062&quot;,&quot;videoKey&quot;:&quot;0983acaac7&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}" data-component-name="VimeoToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/926723062?autoplay=0&amp;h=0983acaac7" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" loading="lazy"></iframe></p></div><p><span>The behavior is also a serendipitous way to formalize the earlier observation about AM modulation: this scheme essentially takes a signal running at a carrier frequency </span><em>a</em><span> and varies its amplitude by multiplying the carrier by some slower-running sine at a frequency </span><em>b</em><span>.</span><em> </em><span>From the formula we derived earlier on, the result of this multiplication necessarily indistinguishable from the superposition of two symmetrical sinusoidal transmissions offset from </span><em>a</em><span> by ± </span><em>b, </em><span>so AM signals take up bandwidth just the same as any other modulation scheme.</span></p><p><span>In any case, back to radio: it follows that if one wanted to receive transmissions centered around 10 MHz, a straightforward approach would be to mix the input RF signal with a 10 MHz sine. According to our formulas, this should put the 10.00 MHz signal at DC, downconvert 10.01 MHz to a 10 kHz beat (with an extra 20.01 MHz component), turn 10.02 MHz into 20 kHz (+ 20.02 MHz), and so forth. With the mixing done, the next step would be to apply a lowpass filter to the output, keeping only the low frequencies that are a part of the modulation scheme — and getting rid of everything else, including the unwanted </span><em><span>f</span><sub>1</sub><span> + f</span><sub>2</sub></em><span> components that popped up around 20 MHz.</span></p><p><span>The folly of this method is the modulo operator in the </span><em><span>|f</span><sub>1</sub><span> - f</span><sub>2</sub><span>|</span></em><span> formula, a consequence of </span><em>cos(x) </em><span>being the same as</span><em> cos(-x)</em><span>. This causes unwanted input transmissions directly below 10 MHz to produce beats that are indistinguishable from the desirable signals directly above 10 MHz; for example, a component at 9.99 MHz will produce an image in the same place as a 10.01 MHz signal, both ending up at 10 kHz.</span></p><p>To avoid this mirroring, superheterodyne receivers mix the RF input with a frequency lower than the signal of interest, shifting the transmission to some reasonably low, constant intermediate frequency (IF) — and then using bandpass filters to pluck out the relevant bits before downmixing the IF signal once again. A simple visualization of the benefits of using IF is shown below:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!v8AB!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbfc7191b-daae-411e-b662-d117ec070ace_1791x2144.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!v8AB!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbfc7191b-daae-411e-b662-d117ec070ace_1791x2144.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!v8AB!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbfc7191b-daae-411e-b662-d117ec070ace_1791x2144.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!v8AB!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbfc7191b-daae-411e-b662-d117ec070ace_1791x2144.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!v8AB!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbfc7191b-daae-411e-b662-d117ec070ace_1791x2144.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!v8AB!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbfc7191b-daae-411e-b662-d117ec070ace_1791x2144.png" width="1456" height="1743" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bfc7191b-daae-411e-b662-d117ec070ace_1791x2144.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1743,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:383954,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://lcamtuf.substack.com/i/142762684?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbfc7191b-daae-411e-b662-d117ec070ace_1791x2144.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!v8AB!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbfc7191b-daae-411e-b662-d117ec070ace_1791x2144.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!v8AB!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbfc7191b-daae-411e-b662-d117ec070ace_1791x2144.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!v8AB!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbfc7191b-daae-411e-b662-d117ec070ace_1791x2144.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!v8AB!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbfc7191b-daae-411e-b662-d117ec070ace_1791x2144.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>Avoiding mirrored signals.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>In this design — devised by Edwin Armstrong around 1919 and dubbed </span><em>superheterodyne </em><span>— the fundamental mirroring behavior is still present, but the point of symmetry can be controlled and placed far away.

            <p>I assume it is correct. The domain <a href="http://vstdev.org/">vstdev.org</a> just forwards to <a href="http://vstdevorg.github.io/vstdev.org">VSTDev</a> (on <a href="http://github.io/">github.io</a>) where the website resides. Is your browser complaining about that?</p>

By Josh Moody —
Published: <time datetime="2025-10-19T07:00:00.000Z"> Oct 19, 2025 </time>  </small>  <p>Dana. The interviewer. Friendly, efficient. She leans forward.</p>
<p>“So,” she says, “walk me through FizzBuzz.”</p>
<p>You could do this in your sleep. “Is JavaScript okay?”</p>
<p>She nods.</p>
<p>You open your laptop and begin.</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="js"><code><span><span>let</span><span> S</span><span> =</span><span> (</span><span>x</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> (</span><span>y</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> (</span><span>z</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> x</span><span>(</span><span>z</span><span>)(</span><span>y</span><span>(</span><span>z</span><span>));</span></span>
<span><span>let</span><span> K</span><span> =</span><span> (</span><span>x</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> (</span><span>y</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> x</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>“That should do it,” you say to yourself. “Just need to combine
these a few times.”</p>
<p>Dana raises an eyebrow. You continue.</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="js"><code><span><span>let</span><span> I</span><span> =</span><span> S</span><span>(</span><span>K</span><span>)(</span><span>K</span><span>); </span><span>// x =&gt; x</span></span>

<p>Bluebird, cardinal, warbler, thrush. Avian friends you know
well.</p>
<p>Dana looks puzzled. “Are we still doing FizzBuzz?”</p>
<p>“Getting there.”</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="js"><code><span><span>let</span><span> V</span><span> =</span><span> B</span><span>(</span><span>C</span><span>)(</span><span>T</span><span>); </span><span>// x =&gt; y =&gt; z =&gt; z(x)(y)</span></span>

<p>Dana breaks away from the screen. “Typically I see a <code>for</code> loop
by now. Are you sure we’re talking about the same problem?”</p>
<p>“Trust me.”</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="js"><code><span><span>let</span><span> TRUE</span><span> =</span><span> K</span><span>;</span></span>

<span><span>let</span><span> NOT</span><span> =</span><span> V</span><span>(</span><span>FALSE</span><span>)(</span><span>TRUE</span><span>);</span></span></code></pre>
<p>She stands. “Okay,” she says finally. “Let me stop you there.”</p>
<p>“Something wrong?”</p>
<p>“You’re not the first candidate to show up here and reinvent
programming from first principles using lambda calculus.”</p>
<p>You stare, blankly. “Lambda calculus?”</p>
<p>“Look,” she says. “We’ve all read
<a href="https://tomstu.art/programming-with-nothing">Programming with Nothing</a>.
We’ve all seen
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcVA8Nj6HEo">What is PLUS times PLUS</a>.
You’re not breaking any new ground here.”</p>
<p>You shake your head vigorously. “I would never be caught <em>dead</em>
using Lambda calculus. It’s a bloated language.”</p>
<p>Dana’s turn to stare. You move on to numbers.</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="js"><code><span><span>let</span><span> ZERO</span><span> =</span><span> I</span><span>;</span></span>

<p>Dana leans forward. She seems interested now. “Church numerals?”</p>
<p>“Barendregt. Church is too mainstream.”</p>
<p>You start with a lambda calculus expression.</p>

<p>“Dirty,” you mutter. “But it’s a start.”</p>
<p>You scribble in your notepad briefly. Showing <em>all</em> your work
would be tedious, but you should at least walk her through the
interesting parts.</p>
<p>“First, we add combinators until <code>n</code> is by itself on the right.”</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatory_logic">Combinatory logic</a>
is a model of computation that is extremely minimal. All you
start with are two functions: <code>S</code> and <code>K</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>S</code> is a function that, given three functions <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and
<code>z</code>, returns <code>x(z)(y(z))</code>.</li>
<li><code>K</code> is a function that, given two functions <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>,
returns <code>x</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can compute anything you want just by passing these two
functions into each other. For example, the identity function
<code>I = (x) =&gt; x</code> can be expressed as <code>S(K)(K)</code>.</p>
<p>And you can build up arbitrarily complex functions from there.
There is no limit.</p>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">lambda calculus</a>
without variables. Despite this limitation, combinatory logic is
still Turing complete.</p>
<p>It is also extremely difficult to understand.</p>

<p>If you found this post interesting (whether or not you
understood it), the following resources would be good places
start exploring:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://raymondsmullyan.com/books/to-mock-a-mockingbird-and-other-logic-puzzles/"><em>To Mock a Mockingbird</em>, by Raymond Smullyan</a></li>
<li><a href="https://tomstu.art/programming-with-nothing"><em>Programming with Nothing</em>, by Tom Stuart</a></li>
<li><a href="https://aphyr.com/tags/interviews">Kyle Kingsbury’s <em>Technical Interview</em> series</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In particular, I strongly recommend reading <em>To Mock a Mockbird</em>
if you want to understand combinatory logic. It’s the most fun,
accessible way to learn combinatory logic from scratch. It took
me about a month’s spare time to work through it. Time well
spent!</p>
<h3 id="skoobert">Skoobert</h3>
<p>After reading <em>To Mock a Mockingbird</em>, I wanted to program in
combinatory logic but found existing tools lacking. So I spent a
weekend building Skoobert, which is intended to be the ideal
programming language for experimenting with lambda calculus and
combinatory logic. Give it a try and let me know what you think!</p>
