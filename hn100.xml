with getting the debugger attached,
because that might help us with sorting

which usually makes it pretty easy to attach a debugger to an app.
Normally, we can <code>ssh</code> into the phone
and then start <code>debugserver</code>
attached to a given app:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="objc"><span><span><span>$</span> <span>/</span><span>var</span><span>/</span><span>jb</span><span>/</span><span>usr</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>debugserver</span> <span>0.0.0.0</span><span>:</span><span>4445</span> <span>-</span><span>a</span> <span>AppStore</span>

<source src="https://bryce.co/" type="video/webm">
<source src="https://bryce.co/" type="video/ogg"></video><p>This failure to attach a debugger is thanks to a function called <code>ptrace</code>.
<code>ptrace</code> is a private API on iOS,
but it’s a public API on macOS, which means
we can easily access the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man2/ptrace.2.html">documentation</a> for it.</p><p><code>ptrace</code> is super cool — it is the thing that powers
most of the debugging functionality
that we know and love.
But there’s one operation that we’re particularly interested in here — <code>PT_DENY_ATTACH</code>. From the docs:</p><blockquote><p>PT_DENY_ATTACH</p><p>This request is the other operation used by the traced
process; it allows a process that is not currently being
traced to deny future traces by its parent. All other
arguments are ignored. If the process is currently being
traced, it will exit with the exit status of ENOTSUP;
otherwise, it sets a flag that denies future traces. An
attempt by the parent to trace a process which has set this
flag will result in a segmentation violation in the parent.</p></blockquote><p>Calling <code>ptrace</code> with the <code>PT_DENY_ATTACH</code> request type
will prevent any future debugging requests,
and if the app has already been debugged,
it will exit out of the app entirely.
Very useful if you don’t want anyone poking around your app!</p><p>There are effectively two ways an iOS app can include this functionality,
and how we deal with circumventing it depends on which strategy the app
is using.</p><p>The simplest way for an app to integrate this is to just call the <code>ptrace</code>
function like you’d expect. The method call itself is fairly straightforward:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="objc"><span><span><span>ptrace</span><span>(</span><span>PT_DENY_ATTACH</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We specify the type of <code>ptrace</code> request, <code>PT_DENY_ATTACH</code>, to indicate
that we want to prevent debuggers from attaching; there are then three
more required parameters, but per the docs, they’re all unused
for this request type, so we just set them to <code>0</code>.</p><p>However, because this is a private API, the full
setup to invoke it is a bit more annoying —
you have to look up a pointer to the method first,
define the function’s type information yourself, etc.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="objc"><span><span><span>#import &lt;dlfcn.h&gt;

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If you add this snippet to an iOS app,
and try to launch it, you’ll see the app flash alive for just
a second before being killed — but only if a debugger is being
attached! If you tell Xcode to not debug the
launched executable (via unchecking <code>Scheme &gt; Edit Scheme &gt; Run &gt; Info &gt; Debug executable</code>),
then the app launches fine!</p><h3 id="bypassing-pt_deny_attach-easy-mode">Bypassing <code>PT_DENY_ATTACH</code> (Easy Mode)</h3><p>So that’s how <code>PT_DENY_ATTACH</code> works - now how do we work around it?</p><p>Well there’s one easy weakness to this function,
which is that it only blocks the debugger
<em>after</em> it’s been called.</p><p>So if we put a breakpoint anywhere
before that call — say, at the start of the
<code>prevent_debugging</code> function above —
and then rerun, we’ll see that the debugger attaches just fine.</p><p>This gives us a lot of control to
actually circumvent that <code>ptrace</code> call later.
There’s a bunch of ways we could do that,
but probably the easiest is to just set
a breakpoint on <code>ptrace</code> itself:</p><p>Then when we continue execution,
we can see the debugger stop execution
when the <code>ptrace</code> function is invoked:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="objc"><span><span><span>(</span><span>lldb</span><span>)</span> <span>bt</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>*</span> <span>thread</span> <span>#</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>queue</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>com</span><span>.</span><span>apple</span><span>.</span><span>main</span><span>-</span><span>thread</span><span>'</span><span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>stop</span> <span>reason</span> <span>=</span> <span>breakpoint</span> <span>2.1</span>

</span></span><span><span>    <span>libsystem_kernel</span><span>.</span><span>dylib</span><span>`</span><span>__ptrace</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We’re currently stopped right at the start of the <code>ptrace</code>
function —
which means we can use <code>thread return</code> to back out
to where we were before the call
without actually invoking the function,
and then continue execution again.</p><p>And now we’ve successfully skipped the ptrace call —
the app is launched and our debugger is still attached!</p><p>We can try this strategy in the widget app
by launching <code>debugserver</code> again, but this time not
attaching it
to any currently running process:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="objc"><span><span><span>$</span> <span>/</span><span>var</span><span>/</span><span>jb</span><span>/</span><span>usr</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>debugserver</span> <span>0.0.0.0</span><span>:</span><span>4445</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Instead, we’ll specify the process we’re interested
in from the <code>lldb</code> side, this time using the <code>--waitfor</code>
flag to indicate that the process hasn’t launched yet,
but that we want to attach to it as soon as it does:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="objc"><span><span><span>$</span> <span>lldb</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>(</span><span>lldb</span><span>)</span> <span>platform</span> <span>select</span> <span>remote</span><span>-</span><span>ios</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now if we try launching the app again,
we’ll see <code>lldb</code> successfully attach to the app
before any of its code is executed,
including the code that tries
to kick out the debugger!</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="objc"><span><span><span>Process</span> <span>707</span> <span>stopped</span>

continuing execution, like we did in our above example,
something goes wrong:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="objc"><span><span><span>(</span><span>lldb</span><span>)</span> <span>b</span> <span>ptrace</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The breakpoint is eventually
resolved, but it’s never hit, and we’re kicked
out of the app with an error code.
And then a couple seconds later, the whole
phone reboots again, just for fun!</p><p>Clearly, we’ll need something a bit more involved here.</p><h3 id="bypassing-pt_deny_attach-hard-mode">Bypassing <code>PT_DENY_ATTACH</code> (Hard Mode)</h3><p>I mentioned there are two ways
to integrate this <code>ptrace</code> functionality
on iOS, and the method discussed above
actually has some downsides.</p><p>For one, it’s super easy to find and skip
this <code>ptrace</code> call, just like we saw
in our earlier example — just setting a breakpoint
on <code>ptrace</code> allows it to be quickly identified
and bypassed.</p><p>And two, you have to do that suspicious-looking
runtime lookup using <code>dlopen</code> and <code>dlsym</code> —
which can make it much easier for Apple to recognize
that you’re calling a private API.</p><p>We can actually feed two birds
with one scone here and skip
this <code>ptrace</code> function call altogether.
If we run our earlier example in a sample app, and set a breakpoint
in the <code>ptrace</code> function again,
<code>lldb</code> will show us a disassembly of that function:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="asm"><span><span><span>libsystem_kernel.dylib</span><span>`</span><span>__ptrace</span><span>:</span>

similar within your app, you’ll likely want to use <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Extended-Asm.html">extended asm</a>
instead. But this style makes for an easier walkthrough.</p></blockquote><p>If you’re not well-versed in assembly,
don’t worry — this one’s easier than it looks.</p><p>First we have the same four parameters
that we’re passing in our original <code>ptrace</code>
function call. There’s <code>PT_DENY_ATTACH</code>
(which is literally just the integer value
31), followed by three 0’s.
We’re passing all of those in registers
<code>x0</code> through <code>x3</code>.</p><p>Then we need to tell the kernel which
system call we actually want to make.
iOS expects
that to be passed along in register <code>x16</code>,
which we’re setting to the value <code>26</code>.
That’s the value corresponding
to <code>ptrace</code>, which we can actually see
in the disassembled version
of the real <code>ptrace</code> function above —
it sets register <code>x16</code> to <code>0x1a</code> (<code>26</code> in decimal).</p><p>And then we actually make the system
call itself.
The <code>0x80</code> here
is also unused —
We’re just required to pass a value,
and iOS uses that value <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/56993314">by convention</a>.</p><p>That’s the entire assembly. If we re-run our sample app
with this function added, we’ll see the same behavior as before —
the app will kick us out as soon as a debugger is attached —
all without ever calling the private <code>ptrace</code> function.</p><p>This is a little harder for Apple to detect,
and a little harder for us to work around.
There’s now no common function like <code>ptrace</code>
that we could set a breakpoint on to detect and skip.
We instead have to figure out where in the binary
the system call happens, and then decide
from there how we want to bypass it.</p><p>To do that, we need to open a decrypted copy of the app in a disassembler
and then figure out a way to search for these instructions.</p><p>Luckily, if we look back at those instructions,
one of them sticks out as a good candiate to search for:</p><p>That’s a very specific value being set to a very specific register.
I wouldn’t expect this to appear in regular app code very frequently.
So looking for this instruction
might be a good way to narrow our search space down.</p><p>Most disassemblers should give you an option
to search through their raw disassembled output
text, but that can be super slow,
plus it can be tripped up by small
formatting differences,
like whether numbers are displayed
in hexadecimal or decimal.</p><p>It’s an option if we need it — but we may have a better option here,
which is to search for the exact bytes
corresponding to this instruction.</p><p>I like <a href="https://armconverter.com/">armconverter.com</a> for this. It lets you paste in
an assembly instruction, like</p><p>and get the corresponding
bytes out — in this case:</p><p>So we can search for those bytes in the binary to find potential places
where this <code>ptrace</code> system call is being made.
One consideration here is
that there is another way
that you could write this instruction,
which is to use <code>w16</code> instead of <code>x16</code>.
That’s the same underlying register —
<code>w16</code> is just a 32-bit view,
and <code>x16</code> is a 64-bit view.
Both would be valid ways to write this assembly, so we should search for
both in the binary.</p><p>Searching for the bytes corresponding to <code>mov x16, #26</code>, we find nothing — but searching
for the bytes for <code>mov w16, #26</code>, we get four results:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="txt"><span><span>Address                  Function       Instruction

this is the part of the app that is

with the exact same setup as before,
using the <code>--waitfor</code> command to instruct
<code>lldb</code> to wait til the process has loaded.
But this time, we’ll set a breakpoint
on the addresses
where these system calls are being made.

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In an infinite loop,
we call <code>+[UIScreen mainScreen]</code>, and on the result,
we call <code>snapshotViewAfterScreenUpdates:</code>.
This is a public API
and a fairly common one — it just creates a snapshot of a view.</p><p>But it’s the surrounding implementation
that’s so interesting here.
This is a very memory-intensive method,
but we don’t do anything with the result;
We’re just taking snapshots
in an infinite loop!</p><p>Sometimes a decompilation
can get things wrong, but if we look at the graph view
of this function,
we see the exact same thing —
we’re in an infinite loop,
and all we do within that loop is call
<code>snapshotViewAfterScreenUpdates:</code>.
The result is never referenced.
There are no other methods called.
We have no way to break out of the loop.</p><p>I need to emphasize how crazy this is.
Using too much memory can of course
get your app killed,
but it seems like somebody found a method
that, if you call it too quickly, will
soft-reboot the whole phone (in fact, I later found
that this is the strategy that at least <a href="https://github.com/haxi0/TrollLock-Reborn/blob/484616412a6b056f8fb241db14422ad471d9c1f9/TrollLock/TrollLock/ViewController.m#L115">one jailbreak tweak</a> uses
to respring the phone upon a user’s request) —
and then they chose
to take that information
and write a function
to call it in an infinite loop,
and just torpedo the phone of whoever’s
running this code, in a regular old app.</p><p>That’s delightful!</p><p>In this post’s <a href="https://youtu.be/ih6gWZDuNME">associated video</a>, we trace back
the origin of this call a bit further,
and learn that it’s run whenever a notification named <code>com.apple.tw.twrr</code> is fired,
and that it appears to be tied to the app running a risk check on the phone.
If we don’t pass the check, it resprings our phone.</p><p>The underlying setup is interesting, but we don’t need to dive too far into
it in order to bypass this protection — if we start <code>lldb</code> again,
bypass the anti-debugging call, but this time set an additional breakpoint
on the start of the function that intentionally crashes the phone —
we can just use <code>thread return</code> to skip its execution:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="objc"><span><span><span>(</span><span>lldb</span><span>)</span> <span>br</span> <span>s</span> <span>-</span><span>a</span> <span>0x102A2BB68</span> <span>-</span><span>s</span> <span>TopWidget</span>

we try to inject new code into this app, it <em>also</em> crashes.</p><p>I’ll often do that when I have a debugger attached,
when I need some more complex utilities to help me dive into an app —
like wanting to quickly log the accessibility information of all buttons on screen,
for example.
You could do that just from <code>lldb</code>,
but it would be somewhat painful — it’s
easier to just write that in a framework,
inject that into the app, and then call your utility
function from the debugger.</p><p>But you might also want to inject code if you don’t
have a jailbroken phone in the first place — injecting
tools like <a href="https://frida.re/docs/ios/">Frida</a> or <a href="https://github.com/FLEXTool/FLEX">Flex</a>
let you get some initial exploration of an app without actually needing a jailbreak.
You would usually inject these using a tool that resigns the app
(I like <a href="https://sideloadly.io/">Sideloadly</a>) — but if you do so here,
you’ll see an immediate crash launching the app.</p><p>So is this one more protection,
checking what frameworks are loaded at runtime
and crashing if anything unexpected appears?</p><p>Luckily, no. Some apps do that!</p><p>But we have a much simpler explanation
here. We can look at the crash — using either
<code>lldb</code> or, in the event we were doing this because
we didn’t have a jailbreak in the first place, by
pulling crash logs right from the device.</p><p>In our case, the crash shows the top of the stack trace
as <code>0x1002027D4</code>. Jumping there in our disassembler, we can see
a <code>BRK</code> instruction — which is exactly what we’d expect
in a scenario where the app was intentionally crashing,
like from force-unwrapping a nil value.</p><p>The decompilation of this method is a bit longer,
but scanning through, there’s one line that jumps out as our likely issue:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="objc"><span><span><span>v13</span> <span>=</span> <span>objc_retainAutoreleasedReturnValue</span><span>(</span><span>objc_msgSend</span><span>(</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>v8</span><span>,</span> <span>"containerURLForSecurityApplicationGroupIdentifier:"</span><span>,</span> <span>v12</span><span>)</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>);</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><code>containerURLForSecurityApplicationGroupIdentifier:</code>
is a public, perfectly normal method
that returns a folder that multiple apps or extensions
in a single group can access together.
Usually apps are completely sandboxed
from each other, but putting them in a shared group means
that they can access shared resources.</p><p>The problem is that app groups are defined
as part of the code signing process, and
we just threw away the existing app signature
by injecting code and resigning the app —
and threw away any groups in the process.</p><p>So this method which is supposed to return a URL
pointing to the local file
system is probably returning <code>nil</code>,
and then the app is likely force-unwrapping that
and crashing as a result.</p><p>This is actually a pretty common problem —
and even though it’s acting like a defense
here, it’s probably not on purpose.
This is a widget app,
and it makes sense
that it would need to be in an app group
with its widget app extension that actually controls
displaying widgets on the home screen.</p><p>By far the easiest way to work around
this kind of issue is to just… not resign
the app. A jailbroken phone
makes this significantly easier —
you can inject frameworks into an app
using a jailbreak tweak
without ever having to resign it.
Or you can even run code
that has invalid signatures;
you can add whatever apps to
whatever groups you want.
Jailbreaking makes a lot of codesign
issues just go away.</p><p>In a pinch, though, if you were injecting
a debugging framework
because you don’t have
a jailbroken device,
you can still sometimes
work around things like this
even while resigning the app.</p><p>The app is crashing because it’s expecting
a URL to be returned here and it’s not getting one back.
We can create a small framework that swizzles this method
to make sure that a URL is always returned:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="objc"><span><span><span>@implementation</span> <span>NSFileManager</span> <span>(Swizzle)</span>

</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>@end</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this case, we’re making it
so that anytime
<code>containerURLForSecurityApplicationGroupIdentifier:</code>
method is called,
we’re going to invoke our replacement method instead,
which just returns
some temporary directory.</p><p>It’s worth noting
this is <strong>not</strong> an equivalent replacement
for what the app is actually trying to do —
this method is being called
because the app wants a shared
folder that both it and its app
extensions can access, and we’re lying to it and saying, “Here
you go. Here’s your shared folder” —
even though that is definitely not a shared folder.</p><p>But depending on what you’re trying to do,
that might actually be fine.
I’ve found
little patches like this will often break
the app extensions themselves,
But I usually don’t care about them —
I just want the main app to work fine,
especially if my goal
is to just poke around
at how the app does something,
and I just need
that basic functionality to work.</p><p>You can maybe do something more advanced
here like create your own app group,
resign the main app and all its extensions using it,
and swizzle this method (along with any others you run into)
to use your new group identifier instead. That would be a much larger
effort though, and not likely to be worth it unless you really need it —
at some point, finding a jailbroken device instead is probably worth your while.</p><p>Either way, if we build this framework,
and inject it into the app alongside whatever else
we wanted (like <code>Flex</code>), now the app launches perfectly fine
on a normal device! On a jailbroken device, we still need to attach a debugger
and bypass the earlier protections again,
but once we do, we’re back in the app, this time with <code>Flex</code> successfully
injected, giving us a whole bunch of other useful debugging tools:</p><p><img alt="The main screen of the Top Widgets app" src="https://bryce.co/undebuggable/Flex.png"></p><h3 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h3><p>We’re in the app with a debugger attached, jailbreak detection bypassed, and code successfully injected!</p><p>… what were we here for again?</p><p>Oh, yeah - that’s for next time.</p><p>Until then, if you bypass any anti-debugging protections thanks to this article, or decide to add them
to your own app because you’re just learning about them for the first time — let me know!</p><hr></article></div>]]></description>

We still have a very small (single-digit) number of boards available that we can provide to interested parties, but we kindly ask for your understanding that we must prioritize requests.
Please <a href="mailto:euchner@inue.uni-stuttgart.de">contact me</a> if you would like to receive an ESPARGOS board, or in case you have any questions or ideas to share about use cases, research ideas, open sourcing, manufacturing, or other topics.</p><p>We are still evaluating how to proceed, if we can (and should) make ESPARGOS available to a wider audience.
The hardware design and firmware files of ESPARGOS are currently not open source, but the <a href="https://github.com/ESPARGOS/pyespargos"><code>pyespargos</code></a> library including the demo applications are free software.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <article>


<p>Let’s say we’ve got some graph-like data, such as a social network.</p>

<p>We can represent this generically with two tables:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>create</span> <span>table</span> <span>nodes</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>id</span> <span>serial</span> <span>primary</span> <span>key</span><span>,</span>

  <span>details</span> <span>jsonb</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>create</span> <span>table</span> <span>edges</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>id</span> <span>serial</span> <span>primary</span> <span>key</span><span>,</span>

  <span>details</span> <span>jsonb</span>
<span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And we can insert some data (using lord of the rings characters) like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>insert</span> <span>into</span> <span>nodes</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>details</span><span>)</span> <span>values</span>

</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="simple-queries---finding-parents-and-children">Simple queries - finding parents and children</h2>

<p>We can find someone’s parents by joining the <code>edges</code> table to the <code>nodes</code> table.</p>

<p>Hardcoding the child id (3) to find Samwise’s parents:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>select</span> <span>parent</span><span>.</span><span>name</span> <span>from</span> <span>nodes</span> <span>child</span>
<span>join</span> <span>edges</span> <span>on</span> <span>edges</span><span>.</span><span>to_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>child</span><span>.</span><span>id</span>

<span>where</span> <span>child</span><span>.</span><span>id</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If we didn’t know Samwise’s id, we could find him by name first using a CTE:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>with</span> <span>child</span> <span>as</span> <span>(</span><span>select</span> <span>id</span> <span>from</span> <span>nodes</span> <span>where</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Samwise Gamgee'</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="more-complex-queries---friends-of-friends">More complex queries - friends of friends</h2>

<p>Not all of our characters knew each other directly. The friendship graph is a bit more complex:</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>We could follow two friendship links using CTEs like before. Let’s say friends of friends of Samwise:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>with</span> <span>samwise</span> <span>as</span> <span>(</span><span>select</span> <span>id</span> <span>from</span> <span>nodes</span> <span>where</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Samwise Gamgee'</span><span>),</span>
<span>samwise_friends</span> <span>as</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>select</span> <span>distinct</span> <span>edges</span><span>.</span><span>to_id</span> <span>from</span> <span>edges</span>
  <span>join</span> <span>samwise</span> <span>on</span> <span>edges</span><span>.</span><span>from_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>samwise</span><span>.</span><span>id</span> <span>and</span> <span>edges</span><span>.</span><span>type</span> <span>=</span> <span>'friend'</span>
<span>),</span>
<span>friends_of_friends</span> <span>as</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>select</span> <span>distinct</span> <span>edges</span><span>.</span><span>to_id</span> <span>from</span> <span>edges</span>
  <span>join</span> <span>samwise_friends</span> <span>on</span> <span>edges</span><span>.</span><span>from_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>samwise_friends</span><span>.</span><span>to_id</span> <span>and</span> <span>edges</span><span>.</span><span>type</span> <span>=</span> <span>'friend'</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>select</span> <span>name</span> <span>from</span> <span>friends_of_friends</span> <span>join</span> <span>nodes</span> <span>on</span> <span>nodes</span><span>.</span><span>id</span> <span>=</span> <span>friends_of_friends</span><span>.</span><span>to_id</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This returns almost everyone, except for Arathorn and Gloin who we’ve decided weren’t friends with anyone Samwise knew
(even though they probably knew Gandalf, in reality).</p>

<p>If we don’t mind building up arbitrarily long chains of CTEs, we can follow any number of edges using this technique.</p>

<p>It would be kind of nice to be able to pass in the root node and the edge paths as parameters though, rather than
dynamically building up the CTEs.</p>

<h2 id="parameterised-recursive-ctes">Parameterised recursive CTEs</h2>

<p>Let’s say we want to find the parents of the friends-of-friends of Samwise.</p>

<p>We could do this naively by building up a CTE for each level of friendship:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>with</span> <span>samwise</span> <span>as</span> <span>(</span><span>select</span> <span>id</span> <span>from</span> <span>nodes</span> <span>where</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Samwise Gamgee'</span><span>),</span>
<span>samwise_friends</span> <span>as</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>select</span> <span>distinct</span> <span>edges</span><span>.</span><span>to_id</span> <span>from</span> <span>edges</span>
  <span>join</span> <span>samwise</span> <span>on</span> <span>edges</span><span>.</span><span>from_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>samwise</span><span>.</span><span>id</span> <span>and</span> <span>edges</span><span>.</span><span>type</span> <span>=</span> <span>'friend'</span>
<span>),</span>
<span>friends_of_friends</span> <span>as</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>select</span> <span>distinct</span> <span>edges</span><span>.</span><span>to_id</span> <span>from</span> <span>edges</span>
  <span>join</span> <span>samwise_friends</span> <span>on</span> <span>edges</span><span>.</span><span>from_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>samwise_friends</span><span>.</span><span>to_id</span> <span>and</span> <span>edges</span><span>.</span><span>type</span> <span>=</span> <span>'friend'</span>
<span>),</span>
<span>friends_of_friends_parents</span> <span>as</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>select</span> <span>distinct</span> <span>edges</span><span>.</span><span>from_id</span> <span>from</span> <span>edges</span>
  <span>join</span> <span>friends_of_friends</span> <span>on</span> <span>edges</span><span>.</span><span>to_id</span> <span>=</span> <span>friends_of_friends</span><span>.</span><span>to_id</span> <span>and</span> <span>edges</span><span>.</span><span>type</span> <span>=</span> <span>'parent'</span>
<span>)</span>
<span>select</span> <span>name</span> <span>from</span> <span>friends_of_friends_parents</span> <span>join</span> <span>nodes</span> <span>on</span> <span>nodes</span><span>.</span><span>id</span> <span>=</span> <span>friends_of_friends_parents</span><span>.</span><span>from_id</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But this quickly becomes unwieldy. Instead, let’s pull the variable bits out, and use a recursive CTE:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>with</span> <span>recursive</span> 
<span>root</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>(</span><span>select</span> <span>id</span> <span>from</span> <span>nodes</span> <span>where</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>'Samwise Gamgee'</span><span>),</span>

<p>We'll discuss how to make sure that your access to TLS (thread-local storage) is fast. If you’re interested strictly in TLS
performance guidelines and don't care about the details, <a href="#summary-of-performance-guidelines">skip right to the end</a>
— but be aware that you’ll be missing out on assembly listings of profound emotional depth, which can shake even a cynical,
battle-hardened programmer. If you don’t want to miss out on that — and who would?! — read on, and you shall learn the
computer-scientific insight behind the intriguing inequality 0+0 &gt; 0.</p>
<p>I’ve recently <a href="https://yosefk.com/blog/profiling-in-production-with-function-call-traces.html">published</a> a new
C++ profiler, <a href="https://github.com/yosefk/funtrace">funtrace</a>, which traces function calls &amp; returns as well as
thread state changes, showing an execution timeline like this (the screenshot is from <a href="https://krita.org/">Krita</a>, a
“real-world,” complicated drawing program):</p>
<p><img alt="image8.png" height="776" src="https://yosefk.com/img/funtrace/image8.png" title="a trace of Krita made by funtrace &amp; displayed by vizviewer" width="576"></p>
<p>One thing a software-based tracing profiler needs is a per-thread buffer for traced data. Actually it would waste less memory
for all threads to share the same buffer, and this is how things “should” work in a system with some fairly minimal <a href="https://yosefk.com/blog/profiling-in-production-with-function-call-traces.html#hardware-assisted-tracing">hardware support
for tracing, which I suggested in the funtrace writeup</a>, and which would look roughly like this:</p>
<p><img alt="image5.png" height="336" src="https://yosefk.com/img/funtrace/image5.png" title="A trace writer with a DMA bypassing the CPU cache system" width="556"></p>
<p>But absent such trace data writing hardware, the data must be written using store instructions through the caches<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. So many CPUs sharing a trace buffer results in
them constantly yanking lines from each other’s caches in order to append to the buffer, with a spectacular slowdown. And then
you'd need to synchronize updates to the current write position — still more slowdown. A shared buffer can be fine for <a href="https://yosefk.com/blog/delayed-printf-for-real-time-logging.html">user-initiated printing</a>, but it’s too slow for
tracing every call and return.</p>
<p>So per-thread buffers it is — bringing us to C++’s <code>thread_local</code> keyword, which gives each thread its own copy of
a variable in the global scope — perfect for our trace buffers, it would seem. But it turns out that <strong>we need to be
careful with exactly how we use <code>thread_local</code> to keep our variable access time from exploding</strong>, as explained
in the rest of this document.</p>
<p>The C toolchain — not the C++ compiler front-end, but assemblers, linkers and such — is generally quite ossified, with <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76925604/why-is-the-constructor-of-a-global-variable-not-called-in-a-library">decades-old
linker bugs enshrined as a standard</a><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. TLS
is an interesting case when this toolchain was actually given quite the facelift to support a new feature — with the result of
simple, convenient syntax potentially hiding fairly high overhead (contrary to the more typical case of inconvenient syntax, no
new work in the toolchain, and resource use being fairly explicit.)</p>
<p>At first glance, TLS looks wonderfully efficient, with a whole machine register dedicated to making access to these exotic
variables fast, and a whole scheme set up in the linker to use this register. Let’s take this code accessing a
<code>thread_local</code> object named <code>tls_obj</code>:</p>
<pre><code>int get_first() {
  return tls_obj.first_member;
}</code></pre>
<p>This compiles to the following assembly code:</p>
<pre>  <b><span>movl  %fs:<i>tls_obj</i>@tpoff, %eax</span></b>
</pre>
<p>This loads data from the address of <code>tls_obj</code> into the <code>%eax</code> register where the return value should
go. The address of tls_obj is computed by adding the value of the register <code>%fs</code> and the constant offset
<code>tls_obj@tpoff</code>. Here, <code>%fs</code> is the TLS base address register on x86; other machines similarly reserve a
register for this. <code>tls_obj@tpoff</code> is an offset from the base address of the TLS area allocated per thread, and it’s
assigned by the linker such that room is reserved within the TLS area for every <code>thread_local</code> object in the linked
binary. Is this awesome or what?!</p>
<h2 id="constructors">Constructors</h2>
<p>If instead we access a <code>thread_local</code> object with a constructor — let's call it <code>tls_with_ctor</code> — we
get assembly code like this (and this is with <code>-O3</code> – you really don’t want to see the unoptimized version of
this):</p>
<pre>  <span>cmpb  $0, %fs:<b><i>__tls_guard</i></b>@tpoff
  je    .slow_path</span>
  <b><span>movl  %fs:<i>tls_with_ctor</i>@tpoff, %eax</span></b>
  ret
<b>.slow_path:</b>
  // inlined call to __tls_init, which constructs
  // <b>all</b> the TLS variables in this translation unit…
  pushq %rbx
  movq  %fs:0, %rbx
  movb  $1, %fs:<b><i>__tls_guard</i></b>@tpoff
  leaq  <b><i>tls_with_ctor</i></b>@tpoff(%rbx), %rdi
  call  <b><i>Class::Class()</i></b>
  leaq  <b><i>tls_with_ctor2</i></b>@tpoff(%rbx), %rdi
  call  <b><i>Class2::Class2()</i></b>
  // …followed by our function’s code
  <b><span>movl    %fs:<i>tls_with_ctor</i>@tpoff, %eax</span></b>
  popq  %rbx
  ret
</pre>
<p>Our simple access to a register plus offset has evolved to first check a thread-local “guard variable”, and if it’s not yet
set to 1, it now calls the constructors for all of the thread-local objects in the translation unit. (<code>__tls_guard</code>
is an implicitly generated <code>static</code>, per-translation-unit boolean.)</p>
<p>While funtrace’s call/return hooks, which get their trace buffer pointer from TLS, are called all the time, access to
<code>thread_local</code>s should be more rare in “normal” code — so not sure it’s fair to brand this <code>__tls_guard</code>
approach as having “unacceptable overhead.” Of course, the inlining only happens if your thread_local is defined in the same
translation unit where you access it; <strong>accessing an <code>extern thread_local</code> with a constructor involves a
function call</strong>, with the function testing the guard variable of the translation unit where the thread_local is defined.
But with inlining, the fast path is quite fast on a good processor (I come from an embedded background where you usually have
<em>cheap </em>CPUs rather than <em>good</em>, so an extra load and a branch depending on the loaded value shock me more than
they should; a superscalar out-of-order branch-predicting speculatively-executing CPU will handle this just fine.)</p>
<p>What I don’t understand is why. Like, <em>why.</em> Generating this code must have taken a bunch of compiler work; it didn’t
“just happen for free.” Furthermore, the <code>varname@tpoff</code> thing must have involved some linker work; it’s not like
keeping the linker unchanged was a constraint. Why not arrange for the <code>__tls_init</code> function of every translation
unit (the one that got inlined into the slow path above) to be called before a thread’s entry point is called? Because it would
require a little bit of libc or libpthread work?..</p>
<p>I mean, this was done for <em>global constructors</em>. You don’t check whether you called the global constructors of a
translation unit before accessing a global with a constructor (and sure, <em>that </em>would have been even slower than the TLS
init code checking <code>__tls_guard</code>, because it would need to have been a <em>thread-safe</em> guard variable access;
though even <em>this </em>was implemented for calling the constructors of <em>static variables declared inside functions,
</em>see also <code>-fno-threadsafe-statics</code>.) It’s not really harder to do this for TLS constructors than for global
constructors, except that we need <code>pthread_create</code> to call this code, which, why not?..</p>
<p>Is this a deliberate performance tradeoff, benefitting code with lots of thread_locals and starting threads constantly, with
each thread using few of the thread_locals, and some thread_locals having slow constructors? But such code isn't great to begin
with?.. Anyway, I don’t really get why the ugly thing above is generated from <code>thread_local</code>s’ constructors. The way
I handled it in my case is, <strong>funtrace sidesteps the TLS constructor problem by <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19683-01/816-1386/chapter3-26/index.html">interposing</a>
<code>pthread_create</code></strong>, and initializing its <code>thread_local</code>s in its pthread_create wrapper.</p>
<p>Note that for whatever reason it was chosen, construct-on-first-use is <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/storage_duration">mandated</a> for thread_locals by the C++ standard, as <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/b5dnjh/0_0_0_c_thread_local_storage_performance#c_xxdqud">pointed out by a reader</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Block variables with static or thread(since C++11) storage duration are initialized the first time control passes through
their declaration (unless their initialization is zero- or constant-initialization, which can be performed before the block is
first entered). On all further calls, the declaration is skipped.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And now let’s see what happens when we put our thread-local variable, the one without a constructor, into a shared library
(compiling with <code>-fPIC</code> and linking with <code>-shared</code>):</p>
<pre><b><span>push %rbp
mov  %rsp,%rbp
<span>data16 lea <i>tls_obj</i>(%rip),%rdi
data16 data16 callq <i>__tls_get_addr</i>@plt</span>
mov  (%rax),%eax
pop  %rbp</span></b>
retq 
</pre>
<p>All this colorful code is generated instead of what used to be a single <b><span>movl
%fs:<i>tls_obj</i><span data-cites="tpoff">@tpoff</span>, %eax</span></b>. More code was generated than before,
forcing us to <strong><span>spill and restore registers</span></strong>. But the worst part is that our
TLS access now requires <strong><span>a function call</span></strong> — we need
<code>__tls_get_addr</code> to find the TLS area of the currently running shared library.</p>
<p><strong>Why don’t we just use the same code as before — the <code>movl</code> instruction — with the dynamic linker
substituting the right value for <code>tls_obj@tpoff</code>? </strong>This is an honest question; I don’t understand why this
isn’t a job for the dynamic linker like any other kind of dynamic relocation. Is this to save work in libc again?.. Like, for
<code>tls_obj@tpoff</code> to be an offset <em>from the same base address</em> no matter which shared library
<code>tls_obj</code> was linked into, you would need the TLS areas of all the shared libraries to be allocated contiguously:</p>
<ul>
<li>main executable at offset 0</li>
<li>the first loaded .so at the offset <code>sizeof(main TLS)</code></li>
<li>the next one at the offset <code>sizeof(main TLS) + sizeof(first.so TLS)</code></li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>But for this, libc would need to do this contiguous allocation, and of course you can’t move the TLS data once you’ve
allocated it, since someone might be keeping pointers into it<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. So you need to carve out a chunk of the memory space — no biggie with a 64-bit or even
“just” a 48-bit address space, right?.. — and you need to put the executable’s TLS at some magic address with <code>mmap</code>
and then you keep <code>mmap</code>ing the TLS areas of newly loaded .so’s one next to another.</p>
<p>But this now becomes a part of the ABI (“these addresses are reserved for TLS”), and I guess nobody wanted to soil the ABI
this way “just” to make TLS fast for shared libraries?.. In any case, looks like TLS areas are allocated non-contiguously and so
you need a different base address every time and you can’t use an offset… but <em>still</em>, couldn’t the dynamic linker bake
this address into the code, instead of calling a function to get it?.. Feels to me that this was doable but deemed not worth the
trouble, more than it being impossible, though maybe I’m missing something.</p>
<p>A curious bit is those <code>data16</code><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
in the code:</p>
<pre><b><span>data16 lea <i>tls_obj</i>(%rip),%rdi
data16 data16 callq <i>__tls_get_addr</i>@plt</span></b>
</pre>
<p>What is this for?.. Actually, the <code>data16</code> prefix does nothing in this context except padding the instructions to
take more space, making things slightly slower still, though it’s peanuts compared to the function call. Why does the compiler
put this padding in? Because if you compile with <code>-fPIC</code> but then link the code into an executable, without the
<code>-shared</code>, the function call gets replaced with faster code:</p>
<pre><b><span>push %rbp
mov  %rsp,%rbp
<span>mov  %fs:0x0,%rax
lea  -0x4(%rax),%rax</span>
mov  (%rax),%eax
pop  %rbp</span></b>
retq
</pre>
<p>The generated code is still scarred with the <strong><span>register spilling</span></strong> and
what-not, and we don’t get our simple <b><span>movl %fs:<i>tls_obj</i><span data-cites="tpoff">@tpoff</span>, %eax</span></b> back, but still, we have to be very thankful for the compiler &amp; linker
work here, done for the benefit of the <em>many </em>people whose build system compiles everything with <code>-fPIC</code>,
including code that is then linked without <code>-shared</code> (because who knows if the .o will be linked into a shared
library or an executable? It’s not like the build system knows <em>the entire graph of build dependencies — </em>wait, it
actually <em>does — </em>but still, it obviously shouldn’t be <em>bothered </em>to find out if -fPIC is needed — this type of
mundane concern would just distract it from its noble goal of Scheduling a Graph of Completely Generic Tasks. Seriously, no C++
build system out there stoops to this - not one, and goodness knows there are A LOT of them.)</p>
<p>In any case, the <code>data16</code>s are generated by the compiler to make the red instructions take enough space for the
green instructions to fit into, in case we link without <code>-shared</code> after all.</p>

<p>And now let’s see what happens if we put (1) a thread_local object with (2) a constructor into a shared library, for a fine
example of how 2 of C++’s famously “zero-overhead” features compose. We’ve all heard how “the whole is greater than the sum of
its parts,” occasionally expressed by the peppier HRy people as “1 + 1 = 3.” I suggest a similarly inspiring expression “0 + 0
&gt; 0”, which quite often applies to “zero overhead”:</p>
<pre>sub  $0x8,%rsp
<b><span>callq</span> <i>TLS init function for tls_with_ctor</i></b>@plt
data16 lea <b><i>tls_with_ctor</i></b>(%rip),%rdi
data16 data16 <b><span>callq</span> <i>__tls_get_addr</i></b>@plt
mov  (%rax),%eax
add  $0x8,%rsp
retq
</pre>
<p>So, now we have 2 function calls — one for calling the constructor in case it wasn’t called yet, and another to get the
address of the <code>thread_local</code> variable from its ID. Makes sense, except that I recall that under <code>-O3</code>,
this “TLS init function” business was inlined, and now it no longer is? Say, I wonder what code got generated for this “TLS init
function”?..</p>
<pre>  subq  $8, %rsp
  leaq  <b><i>__tls_guard</i></b>@tlsld(%rip), %rdi
  <b><span>call</span>  <i>__tls_get_addr</i></b>@PLT
  cmpb  $0, <b><i>__tls_guard@dtpoff</i></b>(%rax)
  je    .slow_path
  addq  $8, %rsp
  ret
<b>.slow_path:</b>
  movb  $1, <b><i>__tls_guard</i></b>@dtpoff(%rax)
  data16  leaq  <b><i>tls_with_ctor</i></b>@tlsgd(%rip), %rdi
  data16 data16 <b><span>call</span>  <i>__tls_get_addr</i></b>@PLT
  movq  %rax, %rdi
  call  <b><i>Class::Class</i></b>()@PLT
  data16  leaq  <b><i>tls_with_ctor2</i></b>@tlsgd(%rip), %rdi
  data16 data16 <b><span>call</span>  <i>__tls_get_addr</i></b>@PLT
  addq  $8, %rsp
  movq  %rax, %rdi
  jmp   <b><i>Class2::Class2</i></b>()@PLT
</pre>
<p>Oh boy. So not only doesn’t this thing get inlined, but it calls <code>__tls_get_addr</code> <em>again, <strong>even on the
fast path</strong>. </em>And then you have the slow path, which calls __tls_get_addr <em>again and again</em>…not that we care,
it runs just once, but it kinda shows that this __tls_get_addr business doesn’t optimize very well. I mean, it’s not just the
slow path of the init code — here’s how a function accessing 2 thread_local objects with constructors looks like:</p>
<pre>pushq   %rbx
<b><span>call</span></b>    TLS init function for tls_with_ctor@PLT
data16 leaq tls_with_ctor@tlsgd(%rip), %rdi
data16 data16 <b><span>call</span></b> __tls_get_addr@PLT
movl    (%rax), %ebx
<b><span>call</span></b>    TLS init function for tls_with_ctor2@PLT
data16 leaq tls_with_ctor2@tlsgd(%rip), %rdi
data16 data16 <b><span>call</span></b> __tls_get_addr@PLT
addl    (%rax), %ebx
movl    %ebx, %eax
popq    %rbx
</pre>
<p>Like… man. This calls __tls_get_addr <span><strong><em>4 times</em></strong></span>, twice per
accessed thread_local (once directly, and once from the “TLS init functions”).</p>
<p>Why do we call <em>2 </em>“TLS init function for whatever” when <em>both </em>do the same thing — check the guard variable
and run the constructors of <em>all </em>objects in the translation unit (and in this case the two objects are defined in the
same translation unit, the same one where the function is defined)? Is it because in the general case, the two objects come from
2 different translation units, and nobody bothered to optimize the case where they’re from the same one? I guess I can see how
that could happen…</p>
<p>And what about the __tls_get_addr calls to get the addresses of the objects themselves? Why call <em>that </em>twice? Why not
call something just once that gives you the base address of the module’s TLS, and then add offsets to it? Is it because in the
general case, the two objects could come from 2 different shared libraries? Or is this actually done to help the case when we
compile with <code>-fPIC</code> but link without <code>-shared</code>, so that we can neatly replace both calls to
__tls_get_addr with cheaper instructions computing the offset — remember how we thanked compiler &amp; linker people for doing
that? Whereas with a single call to <code>__tls_get_module_base</code> or whatever we’d call it, we wouldn’t have room to put
the faster instruction sequences in at link time (but I guess we could use some NOPW sequence for that instead, but nobody
bothered)? A case of “no good deed goes unpunished,” or rather “no improvement to the performance of executables goes without a
degradation of the performance of shared libraries?..”</p>
<p>And BTW, with clang 20 (the latest version ATM), it’s seemingly enough for <em>one </em>thread-local object in a translation
unit to have a constructor for the compiler to generate a “TLS init function” for <em>every </em>thread-local object, and call
it when the object is accessed… so, seriously, <strong>don’t </strong>use <code>thread_local</code> with constructors, even if
you don’t care about the overhead, as long as there’s even one thread_local object where you <em>do </em>care about access
time.</p>
<p>What does <code>__tls_get_addr</code> do? Here’s the fast path:</p>
<pre>mov  %fs:DTV_OFFSET, %RDX_LP
mov  GL_TLS_GENERATION_OFFSET+_rtld_local(%rip), %RAX_LP
cmp  %RAX_LP, (%rdx)
jne  .slow_path
mov  TI_MODULE_OFFSET(%rdi), %RAX_LP
salq $4, %rax
movq (%rdx,%rax), %rax
cmp  $-1, %RAX_LP
je   .slow_path
add  TI_OFFSET_OFFSET(%rdi), %RAX_LP
ret
</pre>
<p>These 11 instructions on the fast path enable lazy allocation of a shared library’s TLS — every thread only allocates a TLS
for a given shared library upon its first attempt to access one of its thread-local variables. (Each “variable ID” passed to
<code>__tls_get_addr</code> is a pointer to a struct with module ID and an offset within that module’s TLS;
<code>__tls_get_addr</code> checks whether TLS was allocated for the module, and if it wasn’t, calls
<code>__tls_get_addr_slow</code> in order to allocate it.)</p>
<p>Is this lazy allocation the answer to why the whole thing is so slow? Do we <em>really</em> want to only call constructors
for thread-local variables upon first use, and ideally to even allocate memory for them upon first use? Note that we allocate
memory <em>for all the thread_locals <strong>in a shared library</strong> </em>upon the first use of even one; but we call
constructors <em>for all the thread_locals <strong>in a translation unit </strong></em>upon the first use of even one; which is
a bit random for the C++ standard to prescribe, not to mention that it doesn’t really concern itself with dynamic loading? So
it’s more, the standard gave implementations room to do this, rather than prescribed them to do this?.. I don’t know about you,
but I’d prefer a contiguous allocation for all the TLS areas of all the modules in all the threads, and fast access to the
variables over this lazy allocation and initialization; I wonder if this was a deliberate tradeoff or “just how things ended up
being.”</p>

<li>…but constructors together with <code>-fPIC -shared</code> <em>really </em>takes the cake and is the slowest by far!</li>
<li>…and actually, a thread_local variable x having a constructor might slow down access to a thread_local variable y in the
same translation unit</li>
<li>Prefer putting the data into one thread_local object rather than several when you can (true for globals, too, BTW.) It can’t
hurt, and it can probably help a lot, by having fewer calls to <code>__tls_get_addr</code> if your code is linked into a shared
library.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="future-work">Future work</h2>
<p>It annoys me to no end that the funtrace runtime has to be linked into the executable to avoid the price of
<code>__tls_get_addr</code>. (This also means that funtrace must export its runtime functions from the executable, which
precludes shared libraries using the funtrace runtime API (for taking trace snapshots) from linking with
<code>-Wl,--no-undefined</code>.)</p>
<p>I just want a tiny thread-local struct. It can’t be that I can’t do that efficiently without modifying the executable, so
that for instance a Python extension module can be traced without recompiling the Python executable. Seriously, there’s a limit
to how idiotic things should be able to get.</p>
<p>I’m sure there’s some dirty trick or other, based on knowing the guts of libc and other such, which, while dirty, is going to
work for a long time, and where you can reasonably safely detect if it stopped working and upgrade it for whatever changes the
guts of libc will have undergone. If you have an idea, please share it! If not, I guess I’ll get to it one day; I released
funtrace before getting around to this bit, but generally, working around a large number of stupid things like this is a big
chunk of what I do.</p>
<h2 id="knowing-what-you-shouldnt-know">Knowing what you shouldn’t know</h2>
<p>If I manage to stay out of trouble, it’s rarely because of knowing that much, but more because I’m relatively good at 2 other
things: knowing what I don’t know, and knowing what I shouldn’t know. To look at our example, you could argue that the above
explanations are shallower than they could be — I ask why something was done instead of looking up the history, and I only
briefly touch on what <code>TI_MODULE_OFFSET</code> and <code>TI_OFFSET_OFFSET</code> (yes, TI_OFFSET_OFFSET) are, and I don’t
say a word about GL_TLS_GENERATION_OFFSET, for example, and I <em>could.</em></p>
<p>I claim that the kind of things we saw around __tls_get_addr is an immediate red flag along the lines of, yes I am looking
into low-level stuff, but no, nothing good will come out of knowing this particular bit very well in the context that I’m in
right now; maybe I’ll be forced to learn it sometime, but right now this looks exactly like stuff I should avoid rather than
stuff I should learn.</p>
<p>I don’t know how to generalize the principle to make it explicit and easy to follow. All I can say right now is that the next
section has examples substantiating this feeling; you mainly want to avoid <code>__tls_get_addr</code>, because even people who
know it very well, because they maintain it and everything related to it, run into problems with it.</p>
<p>I’ve recently been seeing the expression “anti-intellectualism” used by people criticizing arguments along the lines of “this
is too complex for me to understand, so this can’t be good.” While I agree that we want some more concrete argument about why
something isn’t worth understanding than “I don’t get it, and I <em>would </em>get it if it was any good,” I implore not to call
this “anti-intellectualism,” lest we implicitly crown ourselves as “intellectuals” over the fact that we understand what
TI_OFFSET_OFFSET is. It’s ridiculous enough that we’re called “knowledge workers,” when the “knowledge” referred to in this
expression is the knowledge of what TI_OFFSET_OFFSET is.</p>

<p>Like I said, it annoys me to no end that TLS access is slow for variables defined in shared libraries. Readers suggested
quite a few workarounds, "dirty" to varying degrees:</p>
<h3 id="inlining-pthread_getspecific">"Inlining" <code>pthread_getspecific</code></h3>
<p>There's a pthreads API for allocating "thread-specific keys" which is a form of TLS. Calling <code>pthread_getspecific</code>
upon every TLS access isn't any better than calling <code>__tls_get_addr</code>. But <a href="https://x.com/pskocik/status/1891494684863680663">we can "inline" the code of glibc's implementation</a>, and if we can
make sure that our key is the first one allocated, it will take just a couple of assembly instructions (loading a pointer from
<code>%fs</code> with a constant offset, and then loading our data from that pointer):</p>
<pre>#define tlsReg_ (__extension__( \
  { char*r; __asm ("mov %%fs:0x10,%0":"=r"(r)); r; }))

inline void *pxTlsGetLt32_m(pthread_key_t Pk){
  assert(Pk&lt;32);
  return *(void**)(tlsReg_+0x310+sizeof(void*[2])*Pk+8);
}
void* getKey0(void) {
  return pxTlsGetLt32_m(0);
}
</pre>
<p><code>getKey0</code> compiles to:</p>
<pre>  mov  %fs:0x10,%rax
  mov  0x318(%rax),%rax
</pre>
<h3 id="compiling-with--ftls-modelinitial-exec">Compiling with <code>-ftls-model=initial-exec</code></h3>
<p>It <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43078859">turns out</a> that there's something called the "<a href="https://maskray.me/blog/2021-02-14-all-about-thread-local-storage#initial-exec-tls-model-executable-preemptible">initial
exec TLS model</a>", where a TLS access costs you 2 instructions and no function calls:</p>
<pre>movq <b><i>tls_obj</i></b>@GOTTPOFF(%rip), %rax
movl %fs:(%rax), %eax
</pre>
<p>You can also make just some variables use this model with <code>__attribute((tls_model("initial-exec")))</code>, instead of
compiling everything with <code>-ftls-model=initial-exec</code>, which might be very useful since the space for such variables
is a scarce resource as we'll see shortly.</p>
<p>This method is great if you can <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> your library, or link the executable against it so that it becomes
<code>DT_NEEDED</code>. Otherwise, this may or may not work at runtime:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the shared object generally needs to be an immediately loaded shared object. The linker sets the DF_STATIC_TLS flag to
annotate a shared object with initial-exec TLS relocations.</p>
<p>glibc ld.so reserves some space in static TLS blocks and allows dlopen on such a shared object if its TLS size is small.
There could be an obscure reason for using such an attribute: general dynamic and local dynamic TLS models are not
async-signal-safe in glibc. However, other libc implementations may not reserve additional TLS space for dlopen'ed initial-exec
shared objects, e.g. musl will error.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="faster-__tls_get_addr-with--mtls-dialectgnu2">Faster <code>__tls_get_addr</code> with
<code>-mtls-dialect=gnu2</code></h3>
<p>It turns out there's a faster <code>__tls_get_addr</code> which you can opt into using. This is still too much code for my
taste; but if you're intereseted in the horrible details, you can read <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43079061">the comment where I found out about this</a>.</p>
<h2 id="see-also">See also</h2>
<p>Various compiler and runtime issues make this slow stuff even slower, and it takes a while to get it fixed. If you stay
within the guidelines above, you should avoid such problems; if you don’t, you might have more problems than described above —
including both performance and correctness:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=81501">mulitple calls to __tls_get_addr() with -fPIC</a> (reported in
2017, status: NEW as of 2025). Some highlights from 2022:
<ul>
<li>“We recently upgraded our toolchain from GCC9 to GCC11, and <strong>we're seeing <code>__tls_get_addr</code> take up to 10%
of total runtime</strong> under some workloads, where it was 1-2% before. It seems that some changes to the optimization passes
in 10 or 11 have significantly increased the impact of this problem.”</li>
<li>“I've shown a workaround I used, which might be useful until GCC handle <code>__tls_get_addr()</code> as returning a
constant addresses that doesn't need to be looked up multiple times in a function.“</li>
<li>“Thanks for the patch! I wonder if it would handle coroutines correctly. <strong>Clang has this open bug <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/47179">"Compiler incorrectly caches thread_local address across
suspend-points"</a> that is related to this optimization</strong>.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=19924">TLS performance degradation after dlopen</a> (reported in
2016; fixed in libc 2.39 in 2023, backported to older libcs up to 2.34 in 2025):
<ul>
<li>“we have noticed a performance degradation of TLS access in shared libraries. <b>If another shared library that uses TLS is
loaded via dlopen, __tls_get_addr takes significant more time</b>. Once that shared library accesses it's TLS, the performance
normalizes. We do have a use-case where this is actually really significant.”</li>
<li>“elf: Fix slow tls access after dlopen [BZ #19924] In short: __tls_get_addr checks the global generation counter and if the
current dtv is older then _dl_update_slotinfo updates dtv up to the generation of the accessed module. So if the global
generation is newer than generation of the module then __tls_get_addr keeps hitting the slow dtv update path. The dtv update
path includes a number of checks to see if any update is needed and this already causes measurable tls access slow down after
dlopen. It may be possible to detect up-to-date dtv faster. But if there are many modules loaded (&gt; TLS_SLOTINFO_SURPLUS)
then this requires at least walking the slotinfo list. This patch tries to update the dtv to the global generation instead, so
after a dlopen the tls access slow path is only hit once. The modules with larger generation than the accessed one were not
necessarily synchronized before, so additional synchronization is needed.”</li>
<li>“the fix for <a href="https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=19924">bug 19924</a> was to update DTV on tls access
up to the global gen count so after an independent dlopen the next tls access updates the DTV gen count instead of falling into
a slow code path over and over again. <strong>this introduced some issues</strong>: update happens now even if the accessed tls
is in an early loaded library that use static tls (l_tls_offset is set), so such access is no longer as-safe and may alloc. some
of this was mitigated by an ugly workaround: “elf: Support recursive use of dynamic TLS in interposed malloc.” a possible better
approach is to expose the gen count of the accessed module directly in the tls_get_addr argument: this is possible on 64bit
targets if we compress modid and offset into one GOT entry and use the other for the gen count when processing DTPMOD and DTPREL
relocs. (then the original logic before the 19924 fix would not slow down after a global gencount bump: we can compare the DTV
gen count to the accessed module gen count. btw we do this with TLSDESC today and thus aarch64 was imho not affected by the
malloc interposition issue.) however i feel this is dancing around a bad design to use the generation count to deal with dlclose
and reused modids. so here is a better approach…”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re not quite following some of the above, this sort of makes my point about <code>__tls_get_addr</code> being
undesirable, though I am not sure how to defend this way of making a point in the general case.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>searchcode.com’s SQLite database is probably one of the largest in the world, at least for a public facing website. It’s actual size is 6.4 TB. Which is probably 6 terabytes bigger than yours.</p>
<pre><code>-rw-r--r-- 1 searchcode searchcode 6.4T Feb 17 04:30 searchcode.db
</code></pre>
<p>At least, I think its bigger. I have no evidence to the contrary, being by far the largest I have ever heard of. Poking around the internet did not find anyone talking publicly about anything bigger. The largest I could find using any search or LLM was 1 TB (without source), and a few people on HN and Reddit claiming to be working with SQLite database’s around the size of 10’s of gigabytes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However lack of evidence does not mean such as thing does not exist, and so if you do have a larger database please let me know, either by mocking me on some comment section somewhere, or by direct abuse using my email below and I will be appropriately scolded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probably more interesting is why searchcode.com has such a large SQLite database. For those who don’t know <a href="https://searchcode.com/">https://searchcode.com/</a> is my side/desperately needs to pay for itself/ passion project, which as the name suggests is a place to search source code. It has multiple sources including, github, bitbucket, codeplex, sourceforge, gitlab and 300+ languages. I have written about it a lot, which probably one of the more interesting posts about building its own index <a href="https://boyter.org/posts/how-i-built-my-own-index-for-searchcode/">https://boyter.org/posts/how-i-built-my-own-index-for-searchcode/</a></p>
<p>searchcode.com itself is now officially a ship of Theseus project, as every part I started with has now been replaced. A brief history,</p>
<ul>
<li>First version released using PHP, CodeIgniter, MySQL, Memcached, Apache2 and Sphinx search</li>
<li>Rewritten using Python, Django, MySQL, Memcached, Sphinx search, Nginx and RabbitMQ</li>
<li>Never publicly released version using Java, MySQL, Memcached, Nginx and Sphinx search</li>
<li>Start of Covid 19 rewritten using Go, MySQL, Redis, Caddy and Manticore search</li>
<li>Replaced Manticore search with <a href="https://boyter.org/posts/how-i-built-my-own-index-for-searchcode/">custom index</a> now the stack consists Go, MySQL, Redis and Caddy</li>
<li>As of a few days ago Go, SQLite, Caddy</li>
</ul>
<p>The constant between everything till now was the use of MySQL as the storage layer. The reasons for using it initially was it was there, I knew how to work it and it would scale along with my needs fairly well. So what changed? If you look at my previous choices you will see there is in general a move to reducing the number of dependencies. The older and more crusty I get the more I appreciate having a single binary I can just deploy. Single binary deploys are very simple to reason about.</p>
<p>So why SQLite? Well mostly because you can compile it directly into the binary, so I can have my single binary deploy. No need to install any dependencies. Why not write my own? I am not confident enough in my abilities to write something like this myself, at least not in any reasonable time frame. While I may be crazy enough to write my own index engine, I am not crazy enough to write my own storage persistence layer.</p>
<p>Looking at embedded databases I had previously used and played around with embedded Go databases such as <a href="https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt">bbolt</a> but they never worked at the sort of scale I was expecting to deal with, and since the data I was working with was already mostly relational I wanted to stay in the SQL world.</p>
<p>SQLite has not been totally fault free however. Previously I had used it and ended up with the dreaded <code>"database is locked"</code> error till I found a blog mentioning the best solution in Go is to have two connections. The first being limited to the number of CPU’s for reading and another with a single connection for writing. Something like the below achieves this, and ensures you still have excellent read performance while avoiding the aforementioned error.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="go"><span><span><span>dbRead</span>, <span>_</span> <span>:=</span> <span>connectSqliteDb</span>(<span>"dbname.db"</span>)
</span></span><span><span><span>defer</span> <span>dbRead</span>.<span>Close</span>()

</span></span><span><span><span>dbWrite</span>.<span>SetMaxOpenConns</span>(<span>1</span>)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The other issues I had previously had was cross compiling with CGO. I use a ARM Mac for personal development, for the battery life to and performance. However I deploy to Linux instances. Cross compiling such a thing in Go is trivial till you add in CGO and it becomes a major pain in the backside. Thankfully pure Go versions of SQLite exist such as <a href="https://modernc.org/sqlite">https://modernc.org/sqlite</a> which resolves the issue, at the expense of some performance.</p>
<p>With the above issues resolved first on some other projects, on August 13 2024 I started work on the conversion from MySQL to SQLite. Converting over to SQLite allowed me to start by improving database access by using <a href="https://sqlc.dev/">SQLC</a>. For those curious, you write SQL queries, and it converts them into type safe code you can then call. It’s an amazing tool and gets close to the C# Entity Framework level of productivity. I wrote something similar to it a long time ago in PHP but SQLC is a much better executed version of the idea.</p>
<p>Converting over to SQLite was actually fairly simple as a result and I had a proof of concept working locally in a week or two. However I then needed to start looking into the migration and thats where a lot of the pain started.</p>
<p>I had always known that storing code in a database was going to be problematic, simply because of the quantity of content. As a result I had used MySQL’s <code>compress</code> and <code>uncompress</code> functions when storing any code. Not the most ideal solution but it did crunch down the database enough that I could store it on SSD’s most of the time. However SQLite does not have such a function unless you pay (<code>PRAGMA compression = 'zip';</code>) or look to some 3rd party plugin.</p>
<p>I looked around and found the following <a href="https://phiresky.github.io/blog/2022/sqlite-zstd/">https://phiresky.github.io/blog/2022/sqlite-zstd/</a> which looked promising, but given that it came with the warning <code>I wouldn't trust it with my data (yet).</code> and that I would have needed to use a CGO version of SQLite.</p>
<p>I was discussing the issue on the TechZing podcast discord when someone mentioned that while they had not tried compression in SQLite themselves but that I might want to consider compression on the filesystem level. Some searching around showed that this could be very viable option, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29148198">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29148198</a> <a href="https://trunc.org/learning/compressing-sqlite-with-zfs">https://trunc.org/learning/compressing-sqlite-with-zfs</a>.</p>
<p>So I got to work on a few linux VM’s with attached disks. Fiddling around with mounting disks with different filesystems in Linux is not something I had done since ReiserFS was a thing (I since discovered it has been removed from the kernel). I started looking at ZFS, since thats the only filesystem I knew supported encryption. Knowing nothing about ZFS I was suggested to look at BTRFS since it should in theory be simpler and turned out to be trivial to setup with zstd compression.</p>
<p>Initial tests on a subset of the data showed a pretty drastic compression ratio.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ compsize /mnt/btrfs-partition
Processed 1 file, 150753 regular extents (150753 refs), 0 inline.
Type       Perc     Disk Usage   Uncompressed Referenced  
TOTAL       20%      3.8G          18G          18G       
none       100%       71M          71M          71M       
zstd        20%      3.7G          18G          18G  
</code></pre><p>With that done, I exported the entirety of searchcode’s database in preparation of the migration. This was done using a custom Go program hooking into both the previously written SQL logic and the new SQLC code. The conversion was surprisingly easy, with the only thing to keep in mind using transactions around batches of SQLite inserts to maintain insert performance.</p>
<p>I explicitly coded it to back off when the system was under load and after several days had an output 6.4TB SQLite file. This had me worried at first, since as mentioned I could not find any example of anyone working with SQLite at this level. As such I double checked my indexes and then ran the queries searchcode needs against it in a loop to establish all returned quickly. In fact most returned faster than the MySQL instance I was replacing, which stands to reason given I was replacing the network transfer that was happening previously.</p>
<p>With all of the above done I had one last thing to consider. Should I replace the server? searchcode.com was running on an older AMD 5950x. Still a powerful CPU, but I do like to replace the hardware every few years to get as much performance as possible. So I had a look around and decided to upgrade, to a new server. A real server. One with more cores, more RAM, ECC ram, and faster disks such as this from Hetzner <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/dedicated-rootserver/ex130-r/">https://www.hetzner.com/dedicated-rootserver/ex130-r/</a> which interestingly turned out to be an Intel CPU. As such searchcode is now running on a Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 5412U with 256 GB of RAM. The increase in RAM allows me to grow the index by some factor (at least 2x) as well as improve it’t false positive match rates by tweaking the bloom filters.</p>
<p>I ordered and with it setup a day later, started migration over the network (this took a day or two) after setting up the new box box with the BRFS partition. Sadly the data turned out to be less compressible than my tests first suggested, but it still fits nicely into the storage I have for it with a fair amount of room to grow, albeit less than I had hoped for.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ compsize /mnt/data/searchcode.db

</code></pre><p>So with everything setup and ready to do I flipped over the DNS entries to the new server and observed. Nothing appeared to go amiss, and so I left the updated DNS records in place. If you visit <a href="https://searchcode.com/">https://searchcode.com/</a> you should be usingthe brand new code with SQLite backend. This post is already pretty long so I am not going to go through the new functionality that was released, instead saving it for another post.</p>
<p>As for SQLite? Well so far it appears to be working fine? While the schema searchcode uses is fairly simple, avoiding joins where possible and properly indexed I would not have expected SQLite to cope as well as it has. In fact making searchcode.com live with it was a giant leap of faith in it. I had no examples to follow were it to have issues, and while I had not done anything obviously wrong I was still deeply worried about hitting some unexpected issues. So far however this does not seem to be the case, with everything compared to the previous instance being much faster, from searches, to fetching pages and all of the backend processes that run.</p>
<p>As I write/public this indexing is still happening, with the cores nicely indexing away, proving that the index I wrote scales nicely, even if it does abuse the poor garbage collector by allocating memory all over the place as the following log output indicates <code>memoryusage::Alloc = 69731 MB::TotalAlloc = 196538564 MB::Sys = 89425 MB::tNumGC = 48080</code>. Watching all 48 cores light up however always fills my heart with joy. There really is something about watching the blinkenlights.</p>
<p><img src="https://boyter.org/static/sqlite/moar_cores.png" alt="searchcode.com feeding the cores"></p>
<p>So whats next? Well the plan is to double down on searchcode.com this year. I want to expand it out, and get it back to a state of paying for itself, and then to some level of profitability, and expand it out further. I have a heap of ideas on how to do that which will be running though over the coming weeks. I also want to start to focus on other services besides github to index, since they have their own nice search already. If you are running a 3rd party code hosting service, contact me as id love to explore this with you.</p>

   <p>Scenes of confusion and chaos unfolded over the last two days at the civilian agency that oversees the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile, as the Trump administration's mass firings were carried out before being "paused" on Friday.</p>   <p>This account of firings at the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/28/nx-s1-5119933/meet-americas-secret-team-of-nuclear-first-responders" target="_blank">National Nuclear Security Administration</a> (NNSA) is based on interviews with several current and former NNSA employees who asked to remain anonymous, fearing retribution from the Trump administration.</p>   <p>Officials were given hours to fire hundreds of employees, and workers were shut out of email as termination notices arrived. The terminations were part of a broader group of dismissals at the Department of Energy, where reportedly more than a thousand federal workers were terminated. It was all a result of Elon Musk's <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/11/nx-s1-5293504/trump-musk-doge-oval-office" target="_blank">Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)</a> initiative to slash the federal workforce and what Musk and President Trump characterize as excessive government spending. </p>   
   <p>The NNSA is a semi-autonomous agency within the Department of Energy that oversees the U.S. stockpile of thousands of nuclear weapons. Despite having the words "National" and "Security" in its title, it was not getting an exemption for national security, managers at the agency were told last Friday, according to an employee at NNSA who asked not to be named, fearing retribution from the Trump administration. Just days before, officials in leadership had scrambled to write descriptions for the roughly 300 probationary employees at the agency who had joined the federal workforce less than two years ago.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5298190-100" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Managers were given just 200 characters to explain why the jobs these workers did mattered.</p>   <p>It was a tall order for the relatively obscure civilian agency that conducts a wide variety of nuclear security missions, including servicing the nation's nuclear weapons when they're not on missiles and bombers, and making extensive safety and security upgrades of the warheads. Some workers were responsible for making sure emergency response plans were in place at sites like a giant facility in Texas, where thousands of dismantled warheads are stored. Others worked to prevent terrorists and rogue nations from acquiring weapons-grade plutonium or uranium. Many had "Q" clearances, the highest level security clearance at the Department of Energy.</p>   
   <p>The Department of Energy's press office did not respond to repeated requests by NPR for comment.</p>   <p>In the final days leading up to the firings, managers drew up lists of essential workers and pleaded to keep them.</p>   <p>In the end, it didn't matter. On Thursday, officials were told that the vast majority of the exemptions they had asked for were denied by the Trump administration. Multiple current and former employees at the agency told NPR that scores of people were notified verbally they were fired. Many had to clear out their desks on the spot. "It broke my heart," says one employee who was among those who left the agency's Washington, D.C., headquarters.</p>   <div id="resg-s1-49185">

            <p>Word2vec is a pervasive tool for learning word embeddings. Its success, however, is mostly due to particular architecture choices. Transferring these choices to traditional distributional methods makes them competitive with popular word embedding methods.</p>

<p>Excuse the rather clickbait-y title. This is a blog post that I meant to write for a while. In this post, I want to highlight the factors, i.e. the secret ingredients that account for the success of word2vec.<br>
In particular, I want to focus on the connection between word embeddings trained via neural models and those produced by traditional distributional semantics models (DSMs). By showing how these ingredients can be transferred to DSMs, I will demonstrate that distributional methods are in no way inferior to the popular word embedding methods.<br>
Even though this is no new insight, I feel that traditional methods are frequently overshadowed amid the deep learning craze and their relevancy consequently deserves to be mentioned more often.</p>
<p>To this effect, the paper on which this blog post is based is <em>Improving Distributional Similarity with Lessons Learned from Word Embeddings</em> <sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> by Levy et al. (2015). If you haven't read it, I recommend you to check it out.</p>
<p>Over the course of this blog post, I will first introduce GloVe, a popular word embedding model. I will then highlight the connection between word embedding models and distributional semantic methods. Subsequently, I will introduce the four models that will be used to measure the impact of the different factors. I will then give an overview of all additional factors that play a role in learning word representations, besides the choice of the algorithm. I will finally present the results by Levy et al., their takeaways and recommendations.</p>
<h2 id="glove">GloVe</h2>
<p>In a <a href="http://ruder.io/word-embeddings-1/index.html?ref=ruder.io">previous blog post</a>, we have given an overview of popular word embedding models. One model that we have omitted so far is GloVe <sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Briefly, GloVe seeks to make explicit what SGNS does implicitly: Encoding meaning as vector offsets in an embedding space -- seemingly only a serendipitous by-product of word2vec -- is the specified goal of GloVe.<br>
Specifically, the authors of Glove show that the ratio of the co-occurrence probabilities of two words (rather than their co-occurrence probabilities themselves) is what contains information and aim to encode this information as vector differences.<br>
To achieve this, they propose a weighted least squares objective \(J\) that directly aims to minimise the difference between the dot product of the vectors of two words and the logarithm of their number of co-occurrences:</p>
<p>\(J = \sum\limits_{i, j=1}^V f(X_{ij})   (w_i^T \tilde{w}_j + b_i + \tilde{b}_j - \text{log}   X_{ij})^2 \)</p>
<p>where \(w_i\) and \(b_i\) are the word vector and bias respectively of word \(i\), \(\tilde{w}_j\) and \(b_j\) are the context word vector and bias respectively of word \(j\), \(X_{ij}\) is the number of times word \(i\) occurs in the context of word \(j\), and \(f\) is a weighting function that assigns relatively lower weight to rare and frequent co-occurrences.</p>
<p>As co-occurrence counts can be directly encoded in a word-context co-occurrence matrix, GloVe takes such a matrix rather than the entire corpus as input.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about GloVe, the best reference is likely <a href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D14-1162?ref=ruder.io">the paper</a> and the <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/?ref=ruder.io">accompanying website</a>. Besides that, you can find some additional intuitions on GloVe and its difference to word2vec by the author of gensim <a href="http://rare-technologies.com/making-sense-of-word2vec/?ref=ruder.io">here</a>, in <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-is-GloVe-different-from-word2vec?ref=ruder.io">this Quora thread</a>, and in <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/text2vec/vignettes/glove.html?ref=ruder.io">this blog post</a>.</p>
<h2 id="wordembeddingsvsdistributionalsemanticsmodels">Word embeddings vs. distributional semantics models</h2>
<p>The reason why word embedding models, particularly word2vec and GloVe, became so popular is that they seemed to continuously and significantly outperform DSMs. Many attributed this to the neural architecture of word2vec or the fact that it predicts words, which seemed to have a natural edge over solely relying on co-occurrence counts.</p>
<p>We can view DSMs as <em>count</em> models as they "count" co-occurrences among words by operating on co-occurrence matrices. In contrast, neural word embedding models can be seen as <em>predict</em> models, as they try to predict surrounding words.</p>
<p>In 2014, Baroni et al. <sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> showed that predict models consistently outperform count models in almost all tasks, thus providing a clear verification for the apparent superiority of word embedding models. Is this the end? No.</p>
<p>Already with GloVe we've seen that the differences are not as clear-cut: While GloVe is considered a predict model by Levy et al. (2015), it is clearly factorizing a word-context co-occurrence matrix, which brings it close to traditional methods such as PCA and LSA. Even more, Levy et al. <sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> demonstrate that word2vec implicitly factorizes a word-context PMI matrix.</p>
<p>Consequently, while on the surface DSMs and word embedding models use different algorithms to learn word representations -- the first count, the latter predict -- fundamentally, both types of models act on the same underlying statistics of the data, i.e. the co-occurrence counts between words.</p>
<p>Thus, the question that still remains and which we will dedicate the rest of this blog post to answering is the following:<br>
<em>Why do word embedding models still perform better than DSM with almost the same information?</em></p>
<h2 id="models">Models</h2>
<p>Following Levy et al. (2015), we will isolate and identify the factors that account for the success of neural word embedding models and show how these can be transferred to traditional methods by comparing the following four models:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Positive Pointwise Mutual Information (PPMI)</strong>: PMI is a common measure for the strength of association between two words. It is defined as the log ratio between the joint probability of two words \(w\) and \(c\) and the product of their marginal probabilities: \(PMI(w,c) = \text{log}   \dfrac{P(w,c)}{P(w) P(c)} \). As \( PMI(w,c) = \text{log}   0 = - \infty \) for pairs \( (w,c) \) that were never observed, PMI is in practice often replaced with <em>positive</em> PMI (PPMI), which replaces negative values with \(0\), yielding \(PPMI(w,c) = \text{max}(PMI(w,c),0)\).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Singular Value Decomposition (SVD):</strong> SVD is one of the most popular methods for dimensionality reduction and found its into NLP originally via latent semantic analysis (LSA). SVD factories the word-context co-occurrence matrix into the product of three matrices \(U \cdot \Sigma \times V^T \) where \(U\) and \(V\) are orthonormal matrices (i.e. square matrices whose rows and columns are orthogonal unit vectors) and \(\Sigma\) is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues in<br>
decreasing order. In practice, SVD is often used to factorize the matrix produced by PPMI. Generally, only the top \(d\) elements of \(\Sigma\) are kept, yielding \(W^{SVD} = U_d \cdot \Sigma_d\) and \(C^{SVD} = V_d\), which are typically used as the word and context representations respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Skip-gram with Negative Sampling (SGNS)</strong> aka word2vec: To learn more about the skip-gram architecture and the negative sampling refer to my previous blog posts <a href="http://ruder.io/word-embeddings-1/index.html?ref=ruder.io">here</a> and <a href="http://ruder.io/word-embeddings-softmax/index.html?ref=ruder.io">here</a> respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Global Vectors (GloVe)</strong> as presented in the previous section.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hyperparameters">Hyperparameters</h2>
<p>We will look at the following hyper-parameters:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="#dynamiccontextwindow">Dynamic context window</a></li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="preprocessing">Pre-processing</h2>
<p>Word2vec introduces three ways of pre-processing a corpus, which can be easily applied to DSMs.</p>
<h3 id="dynamiccontextwindow">Dynamic context window</h3>
<p>In DSMs traditionally, the context window is unweighted and of a constant size. Both SGNS and GloVe, however, use a scheme that assigns more weight to closer words, as closer words are generally considered to be more important to a word's meaning. In SGNS, this weighting is implemented by having a dynamic window size that is sampled uniformly between \(1\) and the maximum window size during training.</p>
<h3 id="subsamplingfrequentwords">Subsampling frequent words</h3>
<p>SGNS dilutes very frequent words by randomly removing words whose frequency \(f\) is higher than some threshold \(t\) with a probability \(p = 1 - \sqrt{\dfrac{t}{f}}\). As this subsampling is done <em>before</em> actually creating the windows, the context windows used by SGNS in practice are larger than indicated by the context window size.</p>
<h3 id="deletingrarewords">Deleting rare words</h3>
<p>In the pre-processing of SGNS, rare words are also deleted <em>before</em> creating the context windows, which increases the actual size of the context windows further. Levy et al. (2015) find this not to have a significant performance impact, though.</p>
<h2 id="associationmetric">Association metric</h2>
<p>PMI has been shown to be an effective metric for measuring the association between words. Since Levy and Goldberg (2014) have shown SGNS to implicitly factorize a PMI matrix, two variations stemming from this formulation can be introduced to regular PMI.</p>
<h3 id="shiftedpmi">Shifted PMI</h3>
<p>In SGNS, the higher the number of negative samples \(k\), the more data is being used and the better should be the estimation of the parameters. \(k\) affects the shift of the PMI matrix that is implicitly factorized by word2vec, i.e. \(k\) k shifts the PMI values by log \(k\).<br>
If we transfer this to regular PMI, we obtain Shifted PPMI (SPPMI): \(SPPMI(w,c) = \text{max}(PMI(w,c) - \text{log}   k,0)\).</p>
<h3 id="contextdistributionsmoothing">Context distribution smoothing</h3>
<p>In SGNS, the negative samples are sampled according to a <em>smoothed</em> unigram distribution, i.e. an unigram distribution raised to the power of \(\alpha\), which is empirically set to \(\dfrac{3}{4}\). This leads to frequent words being sampled relatively less often than their frequency would indicate.<br>
We can transfer this to PMI by equally raising the frequency of the context words \(f(c)\) to the power of \(\alpha\):<br>
\(PMI(w, c) = \text{log} \dfrac{p(w,c)}{p(w)p_\alpha(c)}\) where \(p_\alpha(c) = \dfrac{f(c)^\alpha}{\sum_c f(c)^\alpha}\) and \(f(x)\) is the frequency of word \(x\).</p>
<h2 id="postprocessing">Post-processing</h2>
<p>Similar as in pre-processing, three methods can be used to modify the word vectors produced by an algorithm.</p>
<h3 id="addingcontextvectors">Adding context vectors</h3>
<p>The authors of GloVe propose to add word vectors and context vectors to create the final output vectors, e.g. \(\vec{v}_{\text{cat}} = \vec{w}_{\text{cat}} + \vec{c}_{\text{cat}}\). This adds first-order similarity terms, i.e \(w \cdot v\). However, this method cannot be applied to PMI, as the vectors produced by PMI are sparse.</p>
<h3 id="eigenvalueweighting">Eigenvalue weighting</h3>
<p>SVD produces the following matrices: \(W^{SVD} = U_d \cdot \Sigma_d \) and \(C^{SVD} = V_d\). These matrices, however, have different properties: \(C^{SVD}\) is orthonormal, while \(W^{SVD}\) is not.<br>
SGNS, in contrast, is more symmetric. We can thus weight the eigenvalue matrix \(\Sigma_d\) with an additional parameter \(p\), which can be tuned, to yield the following:<br>
\(W^{SVD} = U_d \cdot \Sigma_d^p\).</p>
<h3 id="vectornormalisation">Vector normalisation</h3>
<p>Finally, we can also normalise all vectors to unit length.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>Levy et al. (2015) train all models on a dump of the English wikipedia and evaluate them on the commonly used word similarity and analogy datasets. You can read more about the experimental setup and training details in their paper. We summarise the most important results and takeaways below.</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>Levy et al. find that SVD -- and not one of the word embedding algorithms -- performs best on similarity tasks, while SGNS performs best on analogy datasets. They furthermore shed light on the importance of hyperparameters compared to other choices:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hyperparameters vs. algorithms:<br>
Hyperparameter settings are often more important than algorithm choice.<br>
No single algorithm consistently outperforms the other methods.</li>
<li>Hyperparameters vs. more data:<br>
Training on a larger corpus helps for some tasks.<br>
In 3 out of 6 cases, tuning hyperparameters is more beneficial.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="debunkingpriorclaims">Debunking prior claims</h2>
<p>Equipped with these insights, we can now debunk some generally held claims:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are embeddings superior to distributional methods?<br>
With the right hyperparameters, no approach has a consistent advantage over another.</li>
<li>Is GloVe superior to SGNS?<br>
SGNS outperforms GloVe on all tasks.</li>
<li>Is CBOW a good word2vec configuration?<br>
CBOW does not outperform SGNS on any task.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>
<p>Finally -- and one of the things I like most about the paper -- we can give concrete practical recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DON'T</strong> use shifted PPMI with SVD.</li>
<li><strong>DON'T</strong> use SVD "correctly", i.e. without eigenvector weighting (performance drops 15 points compared to with eigenvalue weighting with \(p = 0.5\)).</li>
<li><strong>DO</strong> use PPMI and SVD with short contexts (window size of \(2\)).</li>
<li><strong>DO</strong> use many negative samples with SGNS.</li>
<li><strong>DO</strong> always use context distribution smoothing (raise unigram distribution to the power of \(\alpha = 0.75\)) for all methods.</li>
<li><strong>DO</strong> use SGNS as a baseline (robust, fast and cheap to train).</li>
<li><strong>DO</strong> try adding context vectors in SGNS and GloVe.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>These results run counter to what is generally assumed, namely that word embeddings are superior to traditional methods and indicate that it generally makes <em>no difference whatsoever</em> whether you use word embeddings or distributional methods -- what matters is that you tune your hyperparameters and employ the appropriate pre-processing and post-processing steps.</p>
<p>Recent papers from Jurafsky's group <sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup> echo these findings and show that SVD -- not SGNS -- is often the preferred choice when you care about accurate word representations.</p>
<p>I hope this blog post was useful in highlighting cool research that sheds light on the link between traditional distributional semantic and in-vogue embedding models. As we've seen, knowledge of distributional semantics allows us to improve upon our current methods and develop entirely new variations of existing ones. For this reason, I hope that the next time you train word embeddings, you will consider adding distributional methods to your toolbox or lean on them for inspiration.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-1205669765698104829">
<p>Twenty years ago, in 2004-2005, I spent a year at MIT’s Computer Science department as a postdoc working with Professor Nancy Lynch. It was an extraordinary experience. Life at MIT felt like paradise, and leaving felt like being cast out.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjoZE-0eOmKIQ1Z9jrcV_5e1KOny0ho0QAt-qP_asRcIKYan9UcCJDNyyHoxv7np-wV2bqoz2GkNTOqV9n4ImSywp2XunMcOq1euWAe1MN91FMDQedy4RyHbUx4zbdDnYXatF5lQFnbj0EXEpRC8xggO3cuC5VgnpB8fApgnKE50tItZGMzjcsolWTw1kk/s580/stata.jpg"><img data-original-height="429" data-original-width="580" height="296" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjoZE-0eOmKIQ1Z9jrcV_5e1KOny0ho0QAt-qP_asRcIKYan9UcCJDNyyHoxv7np-wV2bqoz2GkNTOqV9n4ImSywp2XunMcOq1euWAe1MN91FMDQedy4RyHbUx4zbdDnYXatF5lQFnbj0EXEpRC8xggO3cuC5VgnpB8fApgnKE50tItZGMzjcsolWTw1kk/w400-h296/stata.jpg" width="400"></a></p><br><h2>MIT Culture</h2><p>MIT’s Stata Center was the best CS building in the world at the time. Designed by Frank Gehry, it was a striking abstract architecture masterpiece (<a href="https://thetech.com/2010/03/19/statasuit-v130-n14">although like all abstractions it was a bit leaky</a>). Furniture from Herman Miller complemented this design. I remember seeing price tags of $400 on simple yellow chairs.</p><p>The building buzzed with activity. &nbsp;Every two weeks, postdocs were invited to the faculty lunch on Thursdays, and alternating weeks we had group lunches. Free food seemed to materialize somewhere in the building almost daily, and the food trucks outside were also good. MIT thrived on constant research discussions, collaborations, and talks. Research talks were advertised on posters at the urinals, as a practical touch of MIT's hacker culture I guess.</p><p>Our research group occupied the 6th floor, which was home to theory and algorithms. From there, I would see Tim Berners-Lee meeting with colleagues on the floor below. The building’s open spaces and spiral staircases connected every pair of floors to foster interaction. The place radiated strong academic energy. One evening, I saw Piotr Indyk discussing something in front of one of the many whiteboards on the 6th floor. The next morning, he was still there, having spent the night working toward a paper deadline. Eric Demaine was on the same floor too. Once, I accidentally sent a long print job (a PhD thesis) to his office printer, and he was angry because of the wasted paper.</p><p>Nancy Lynch set a great example for us. She is a very detail-oriented person and she was able to find even the tiniest mistakes in the papers with ease. She once told me that her mind worked like a debugger when reading a paper, and these bugs jumped at her. The way she worked with students was that she would dedicate herself solely on a student/paper for the duration of an entire week. That week, she would avoid thinking or listening other works/students, even when she wanted to participate. <a href="https://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2013/07/how-i-read-research-paper.html">This is because, she wanted to immerse and keep every parameter about the paper she is working on in her mind, and grok it.</a></p><p>People in Nancy's group were also incredibly sharp—Seth Gilbert, Rui Fan, Gregory Chockler, Cal Newport, and many other students and visiting researchers. Yes, that Cal Newport of "Deep Work" fame was a fresh PhD student back then. Looking back, I regret not making more friends, and not forging deeper connections.</p><h2>Lessons Learned</h2><p>Reflecting on my time at MIT, I wish I had been more intentional, more present, and more engaged. The experience was a gift, but I see now how much more I could have made of it.</p><p>I was young, naive, and plagued by impostor syndrome. I held back instead of exploring more, engaging more deeply, and seeking out more challenges. &nbsp;I allowed myself to be carried along by the current, rather than actively charting my own course. Youth is wasted on the young.</p><p>Why pretend to be smart and play it safe? True understanding is rare and hard-won, so why claim it before you are sure of it? Isn't it more advantageous to embrace your stupidity/ignorance and be underestimated? &nbsp;In research and academia, success often goes not to the one who understands first, but to the one who understands best. Even when speed matters, the real advantage comes from the deep, foundational insights that lead there.</p><p>When you approach work with humility and curiosity, you learn more and participate more fully. Good collaborators value these qualities. A beginner’s mind is an asset. <a href="https://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2020/07/the-great-work-of-your-life-by-stephen.html">Staying close to your authentic self helps you find your true calling.</a></p>

      <p><em>Something’s been bugging me about how new devs and I need to talk about it.</em></p>

<p>We’re at this weird inflection point in software development. Every junior dev I talk to has Copilot or Claude or GPT running 24/7. They’re shipping code faster than ever. But when I dig deeper into their understanding of what they’re shipping? That’s where things get concerning.</p>

<p>Sure, the code works, but ask why it works that way instead of another way? Crickets. Ask about edge cases? Blank stares.</p>

<p>The foundational knowledge that used to come from struggling through problems is just… missing.</p>

<p>We’re trading deep understanding for quick fixes, and while it feels great in the moment, we’re going to pay for this later.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="back-when-we-had-to-actually-think">Back when we had to actually think</h2>

<p>I recently realized that there’s a whole generation of new programmers who don’t even know what StackOverflow is.</p>

<p>Back when “Claude” was not a chatbot but the man who invented the field of information entropy, there was a different way to debug programming problems.</p>

<p>First, search on Google. Then, hope some desperate soul had posed a similar question as you had. If they did, you’d find a detailed, thoughtful, (and often patronizing) answer from a wise greybeard on this site called <em>“Stack Overflow”</em>.</p>

<p>Here’s <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12227594/what-is-the-difference-between-unary-plus-numberx-and-parsefloatx" target="_blank">one of the questions I posed 12 years ago</a>. See the top answer by Nathan Wall (who has earned a whopping 10,000+ points and is apparently a <a href="https://www.stacksource.com/" target="_blank">CTO</a> since 2015):</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://nmn.gl/blog/assets/so-qa-12-years.jpg" alt="Stack Overflow question and answer">
<figcaption>
Do yourself a favor and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/13676265/1518029" target="_blank">go read it</a>, you might learn something new.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Can you imagine that some dude just wrote an answer with this level of detail? Raw, without any AI? And for free?</p>

<p>My original question was thoroughly answered of course, but he didn’t stop there. I learnt so many new facts. Some of them I didn’t even know existed, and others I didn’t even want to know but now they’re etched in my brain forever.</p>

<p>This was the best case scenario if you had a question. If you stumbled upon a particularly difficult problem and didn’t find someone who had answered your question already, then tough luck.</p>

<p>Junior devs these days have it easy. They just go to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" target="_blank">chat.com</a> and copy-paste whatever errors they see. Even lazier ones don’t do the 30 second effort of toggling to a browser window, they just use a tool that does it all in <a href="https://cursor.com/" target="_blank">one place</a>.</p>

<p>It’s convenient and quick.</p>

<p>But, there’s still one reason that StackOverflow was superior:</p>

<p><em>Reading discussions by experienced developers about your topic is the <strong>best</strong> way to learn.</em></p>

<p>Here’s a graph to explain what I mean:</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://nmn.gl/blog/assets/speed-vs-knowledge.jpg" alt="Speed vs knowledge">
</figure>

<p>AI gives you answers, but the knowledge you gain is shallow. With StackOverflow, you had to read multiple expert discussions to get the full picture. It was slower, but you came out understanding not just what worked, but why it worked.</p>

<p>Think about every great developer you know. Did they get that good by copying solutions? No—they got there by understanding systems deeply and understanding other developers’ thought processes. That’s exactly what we’re losing.</p>

<p>I’m not trying to be that guy who complains about “kids these days.” I use AI tools daily. I’m literally <a href="https://nmn.gl/blog/giga">building one</a>. But we need to be honest about what we’re trading away for this convenience.</p>


      
      
      

<h2 id="what-can-we-do">What can we do?</h2>

<p>I’ve been experimenting with ways to fix this (because let’s face it, AI isn’t going anywhere). Here’s what’s actually working:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, use AI with a learning mindset. When it gives you an answer, interrogate it. Ask it why. Sure, it takes longer, but that’s literally the point.</li>
  <li>Next, find your tribe. Reddit, Discord, Mastodon—wherever the smart people hang out. That’s where you’ll find the real discussions happening. The ones that make you go “huh, I never thought about it that way.”</li>
  <li>Do code reviews differently. Instead of just checking if the code works, start a conversation with your team. What other approaches did they consider? Why did they pick this one? Make understanding the process as important as the end result.</li>
  <li>Build things from scratch sometimes. Yes, AI can generate that authentication system for you. But try building one yourself first. You’ll write worse code, but you’ll understand every line of it. That knowledge compounds.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking forward</h2>

<p>Here’s the reality: The acceleration has begun and there’s nothing we can do about it. Open source models are taking over, and we’ll have AGI running in our pockets before we know it. But that doesn’t mean we have to let it make us worse developers.</p>

<p>The future isn’t about whether we use AI—it’s about how we use it. And maybe, just maybe, we can find a way to combine the speed of AI with the depth of understanding that we need to learn.</p>

<p>Let me know if you’ve found other ways to balance this. Or tell me I’m just being an old man yelling at clouds. Either way, let’s figure this out together.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20250211-00/?p=110862">https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20250211-00/?p=110862</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43073992">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="single-wrapper">
    
    <article data-clarity-region="article" id="post-110862">
        <div data-bi-area="body_article" data-bi-id="post_page_body_article">
            <p>One of the reactions to my discussion of <a title="Why did Windows 95 setup use three operating systems?" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20241112-00/?p=110507"> why Windows 95 setup used three operating systems</a> (and oh there were many) was my explanation that an MS-DOS based setup program would be text-mode. But c’mon, MS-DOS could do graphics! Are you just a bunch of morons?</p>
<p>Yes, MS-DOS could do graphics, in the sense that it didn’t actively prevent you from doing graphics. You were still responsible for everything yourself, though. There were no graphics primitives aside from a BIOS call to plot a single pixel. Everything else was on you, and you didn’t want to use the BIOS call to plot pixels anyway because it was slow. If you wanted any modicum of performance, you had to access the frame buffer directly.</p>
<p>Okay, so now you have to write a graphics library for drawing things fancier than a single pixel. Fortunately, Windows 95 required a VGA video card at a minimum, so didn’t have to worry about CGA or EGA. Mind you, the VGA adapter required you to deal with planar modes, so that was annoying. Fortunately, you have a team of folks expert in VGA planar modes sitting down the hall working on Windows video drivers who can help you out.</p>
<p>But the setup program needs more than just pixels. It also wants dialog boxes, so you’ll have to write a window manager to sit on top of your graphics library so you can show dialog boxes with a standard GUI dialog interface, which includes keyboard support for tabbing between elements and assigning hotkeys to fields.</p>
<p>You’ll also have to add support for typing characters in non-alphabetic languages like Japanese. Fortunately, you have a team of folks expert in Japanese input sitting in the Tokyo office working on Windows input methods who can help you out, though the time zone difference between Tokyo and Redmond is going to slow you down.</p>
<p>You also want to <a title="A wrinkle in how Windows 95 setup bootstrapped its initial GUI step" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20241119-00/?p=110543"> take advantage of those fancy new controls</a> that the UI team has been making, so maybe you can walk down the hall and ask them if they could port their controls library to your custom UI framework.</p>
<p>The setup program also wants to do simple animations, so you’ll need a scheduler that can trigger events based on the system hardware timer.</p>
<p>So now you’re going to write all this code for your setup program, none of which is actually involved in setting up Windows 95, but is just the infrastructure needed to run the setup program at all! There’s a lot of stuff here, and you probably won’t be able to cram all of it into 640KB of memory. So now you need to write a protected mode manager (also known as an MS-DOS extender) so you can take advantage of the larger address space afforded by protected mode.</p>
<p>Now take a step back and look at what you’re doing. <a title="Dear Sir, You Have Built a Compiler" href="https://rachit.pl/post/you-have-built-a-compiler/"> You’re writing an operating system</a>. (Or, if you are being uncharitable, you’re writing an MS-DOS shell.)</p>
<p>An operating system with exactly one application: Windows 95 Setup.</p>
<p>What if I told you that Microsoft already had an operating system that did all the things you are trying to do, and it’s fully debugged, with video drivers, a graphics library, a dialog manager, a scheduler, a protected mode manager, and input methods. And it has a fully staffed support team. And that operating system has withstood years of real-world usage? And Microsoft fully owns the rights to it, so you don’t have to worry about royalties or licensing fees? And it’s a well-known system that even has books written about how to program it, so it’ll be easier to hire new people to join your team, since you don’t have to spend a month teaching them how to code for your new custom Setup UI miniature operating system.</p>
<p>Go and grab a copy of the Windows 3.1 runtime.</p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: If you committed to the custom operating system route, you’d have to make sure your miniature operating system could run in a Windows 3.1 MS-DOS session in case somebody wanted to install Windows 95 as an upgrade from Windows 3.1, and in a Windows 95 MS-DOS session in case somebody wants to do a repair install of Windows 95. And then you’d have this weird setup experience where Windows 95 setup is running inside an MS-DOS session.</p>
<p><b>Bonus bonus chatter</b>: Windows setup still follows this pattern of installing a miniature operating system to bootstrap the setup program. But today, the miniature operating system is Windows PE, the Windows Preinstallation Environment.</p>

</div>

<p>I have made several homebuilt radars and done some <a href="https://hforsten.com/backprojection-backpropagation.html">synthetic aperture imaging
testing</a> with them on the ground. I have wanted for a long time to put a radar on<br>
a drone and capture synthetic aperture images from air. When I last looked at
this few years ago, medium sized drones with payload capability were
around 1,000 EUR and up. For example in <a href="https://pure-oai.bham.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/136457382/Final_Version_TGRS.pdf">Low-Cost, High-Resolution, Drone-Borne SAR
Imaging</a>
paper by A. Bekar, M. Antoniou and C. J. Baker, the imaging results look
excellent. They used DJI S900 drone with a list price of about 1,000 EUR. The
price for the whole system is quoted to be £15,000, which is a way too
high for my personal budget even just for the price of the drone. Many other
papers use similar style medium sized drones designed for carrying cameras and
they are usually equipped with RTK-GPS for accurate positioning.</p>
<div id="centered">

</div>

<p>Recently small FPV drone prices have dropped a lot. Small 5 and 7 inch propeller
quadcopters can be bought for about 100 EUR from China (not including battery
and RC controller). Despite their small size they are able to lift about 1 kg or
even heavier payload which is plenty for a small radar.</p>
<p>I bought the cheapest Chinese no-name 7-inch FPV kit and a small GPS+compass
module to support autonomous flying with the goal of making a light weight
synthetic aperture radar system that it can carry.</p>
<h2 id="synthetic-aperture-imaging">Synthetic aperture imaging</h2>
<p>A single-channel radar can only measure the distance to a target and is unable
to detect the angle of the target. When multiple receiver channels are arranged
in a line, the signal travels slightly different distances to each receiver
based on the target's angle, causing phase shifts in the received signals. These
phase shifts allows calculating the angle of the target.</p>
<p>Angular resolution (<span>\(\Delta \theta\)</span>) of antenna depends on its size
approximately as: <span>\(\Delta \theta \approx \lambda/D\)</span>, where <span>\(\lambda\)</span> is the
wavelength, and <span>\(D\)</span> is the diameter of the antenna. For example to have
1 m resolution at 1 km distance requires 0.03° angular resolution with 6 GHz RF
frequency. This would require antenna size to be about 100 meters.</p>
<p>Instead of making a single large antenna, it's possible to move a single radar
and take multiple measurements at different positions. If the scene remains
static, this approach yields the same results as having one many channel radar
system with big antenna. With synthetic aperture radar it's possible to attach
a single-channel radar to a drone, fly it while making measurements, creating
a large synthetic aperture that provides exceptional angular resolution.</p>
<h2 id="radar-design">Radar design</h2>


<p>The design goal for the radar is to get the best imaging performance while being
able to fit into the FPV drone and achieving it with minimal budget (&lt;500 EUR).
The budget limitation rules out using any low-loss RF materials and both
electronics and antennas should be implemented with lossy FR4 PCB material.</p>
<p>The drone is quite small and this limits the maximum size of the radar. The
width of the frame is about 40 mm and propeller tip-to-tip distance is 50 mm
across the frame. Length is about 170 mm, which is much more than width and
means that ideally the radar is skinny. For example Raspberry Pi is 56 x 85 mm
which is too wide. The small size severely limits on what the radar can include.</p>
<div id="centered">
    <p><img src="https://hforsten.com/img/sar_fmcw/fmcw_vs_pulse.svg" width="1360" height="450"></p><p>Block diagrams of FMCW (left) and pulse radar
    (right).</p>
</div>

<p>There are several possible architectures for the radar. I previously made <a href="https://hforsten.com/homemade-6-ghz-pulse-compression-radar.html">pulse
radar</a> that is about 64 x 132 mm. That's little too
wide for the drone, but I believe it would be possible to shrink it a little.
Issue with that radar is that the maximum bandwidth is about 100 MHz and it's
limited by the ADC sampling rate. This corresponds to a range resolution of 1.5
m, which isn't quite high enough for a detailed image. It's hard to get much
larger ADC bandwidth on a reasonable budget and fitting high speed ADCs on the
limited space is also an issue. There's also a variation of pulse radar that has
two ramp generators, one for RX and one for TX. This results in low frequency IF
signal like with FMCW radar. This is an architecture that is often used on SAR
radars as it allows for high RF bandwidth without requiring high speed ADC.</p>
<p>Since pulse radar with switched antenna can't transmit and receive at the same
time, pulsed radar maximum pulse length is limited by the time it takes for the
pulse to travel to the target and back. With for example 100 m minimum distance,
the maximum pulse length to not miss any part of the pulse is only 670 ns.
Because pulse radar needs to divide measurement time between transmission and
reception it reduces the average transmit power and decreases the
signal-to-noise ratio. Large number of very short pulses also complicates the
image formation. Time taken by the SAR image formation scales with the number of
pulses and very short maximum pulse length requires transmitting very large
number of them for a good SNR image.</p>
<p>FMCW radar can transmit and receive at the same time and which improves the
signal-to-noise ratio. The maximum sweep length is only limited by the synthetic
aperture sampling speed requirements but it can be hundreds of µs. Unlike pulse
radar, there is also a minimum sweep length requirement, since reflected signal
is mixed to the transmitted signal it needs to be received while the sweep is
still being transmitted. Long sweep length allows collecting much more reflected
power per one sweep. Pulse radar could also use separate TX and RX antennas so
that this wouldn't be an issue, but that removes its advantages compared to
cheaper to implement FMCW radar. Separate transmit and receive antennas require
more space, but due to large maximum length it should be possible to fit two
small antennas side-by-side under the drone.</p>
<p>In general FMCW radar has advantage for short range and slow moving platform
applications. Pulse radar is required when long range (more than few km) is needed.</p>
<h2 id="rf-design">RF design</h2>
<div id="centered">
    <p><img src="https://hforsten.com/img/sar_fmcw/sar_fmcw_block.svg" width="690" height="339"></p><p>FMCW radar architecture.</p>
</div>

<p>Above is the block diagram of the RF parts of the FMCW radar with dual-polarized
antennas. The sweep is generated by PLL, it's passed through a variable
attenuator and then amplified by the power amplifier. Most of it is passed to
the transmit antenna, polarization switch controls whether vertically or
horizontally polarized antenna is used. Part of the transmitted signal is
coupled to the receiver mixer, where it's mixed together with the received
reflected signal that has been amplified by the LNA. Receiver also has
a polarization switch, together with the transmit switch it allows the radar to
receiver and transmit any of the four combinations of polarizations. The mixer
outputs a low frequency signal that is amplified and then digitized by the ADC.
Some filtering is needed in the receiver to avoid large out of band signals and
ADC aliasing.</p>
<p>DAC or DDS based sweep generation would likely be better than PLL. DDS phase
noise is often better and it can change frequencies essentially instantly
compared to PLL, but PLL is chosen because it's cheaper and requires less space. </p>
<p>RF frequency is going to be around 6 GHz as this is the maximum frequency where
there are many cheap RF components for consumer applications. The highest output
power cheap power amplifiers at this frequency output around 30 dBm. Low noise
amplifiers for the receiver with 1 - 2 dB noise figure can also be obtained
cheaply.</p>
<p>Receiver is direct conversion architecture and the mixer does not have any image
rejection. This causes both frequencies above and below the transmitted signal
to be converted to the same output frequency. This is not ideal as noise below
and above the instantaneous sweep frequency is received increasing the noise
floor by 3 dB. IQ sampling receiver that could reject the other sideband would
need two mixers and ADCs. For only 3 dB increase in the signal to noise
ratio, I didn't think it was worth the cost and PCB space.</p>
<p>Polarization switches allow choosing which polarization is used to transmit and
receive. H is horizontal and V is vertical polarization. This allows measuring
four polarizations: HH, HV, VH and VV, where the first letter denotes TX
polarization and the second RX. Some targets reflect some polarizations more
than others and it is used in remote sensing to determine properties of
reflected targets. For example many smooth targets often reflect the same
polarization with shape of the target determining if it reflects more HH or VV
components. Forest and vegetation usually has higher cross-polarized HV and VH
component reflection compared to roads and bare ground due to multiple
reflections inside the vegetation.</p>
<p>Although H and V antennas are drawn separately in the block diagram, this
doesn't mean that the system requires four antennas. It's possible to design
antenna with two ports, one which radiates H and the other V polarization. Dual
polarized antenna doesn't necessarily need any more space than single polarized
antenna.</p>
<p>It would be possible to receive both H and V at the same time if the radar would
have two receivers. This would have some advantages, it would allow removing the
RX polarization switch which would decrease the losses and only the TX should be
switched allowing more time for each measurement which would also increase SNR.
It would also allow transmitting sweeps faster as there isn't need to multiplex
the receiver polarization switch. However, I didn't consider it being worth the
cost.</p>
<h3 id="tx-rx-leakage">TX-RX leakage</h3>
<div id="centered">
    <p><img src="https://hforsten.com/img/sar_fmcw/tx_rx_leakage.svg" width="530" height="469"></p><p>TX-RX leakage can saturate the receiver on high
    powered FMCW radar if the leakage is too high.</p>
</div>

<p>More RF power generally improves the signal-to-noise ratio, but since FMCW radar
transmits and receives at the same time, it's important to consider the TX-RX
leakage signal. The receiver must be sensitive enough to be able to detect
the thermal noise floor at -174 dBm/Hz without saturating due to leaked
RF power from the transmitter antenna. Typical maximum input power that
saturates the LNA is around -20 dBm. With +30 dBm transmitted power more than 50
dB isolation is needed between transmitter and receiver to prevent the receiver
saturation. Even more isolation might be required if some other receiver
component, such as ADC, saturates first. The variable attenuator before PA can be used to
decrease the transmit power in case high enough isolation antennas don't fit in
the drone. It also affects the receiver mixer's LO power, but mixers LO input
power range should be large enough for it to not be an issue.</p>
<h2 id="link-budget">Link budget</h2>
<p>The equation for the received power at the receiver input can be written as:</p>
<p>$$P_r = \frac{P_t G^2 \lambda^2 \sigma}{(4\pi)^3 r^4}$$</p>
<p>where <span>\(P_t\)</span> is the transmitter power, <span>\(G\)</span> is the antenna gain, <span>\(\lambda\)</span> is
wavelength, <span>\(\sigma\)</span> is radar cross section of the target, and <span>\(r\)</span> is range to
the target. This is the received power from one pulse. Synthetic aperture is
formed by sending multiple pulses while moving and these can all be coherently
summed together to increase the signal to noise ratio. If image is formed from
<span>\(n\)</span> pulses, the received power can be multiplied by <span>\(n\)</span> to get the received
power in the whole image.</p>
<p>Radar cross section <span>\(\sigma\)</span> of the target depends on the resolution of the
radar and radar reflectivity of the ground patch. Target radar cross section
can be written as: <span>\(\sigma = \delta x \delta y \sigma_0\)</span>, where <span>\(\delta x\)</span> is
the resolution in the range direction, <span>\(\delta y\)</span> is resolution in cross-range
direction, and <span>\(\sigma_0\)</span> is reflectivity of the ground patch per square meter.
In this case <span>\(\delta x \approx \delta y \approx 0.3 m\)</span>, depending on the radar
parameters, range and imaging geometry. Reflectivity of the ground patch
depends on the material of the ground patch and the angle of illumination.
Reflectivity of ground is generally higher when it's illuminated at 90 degree
angle (in direction of the ground normal vector). This causes the specular
reflection to reflect back to the radar. At smaller angles there is still some
reflection back to the radar, but it decreases as the look angle decreases.
Typical ground reflectivity is around -20 to 0 dBsm (decibels square meter) with
moderate look angle.</p>
<p>The minimum detectable power is limited by thermal noise of the receiver. It
can be written as <span>\(kTBF\)</span>, where <span>\(k\)</span> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%E2%80%93Nyquist_noise#Derivation">Boltzmann
constant</a>,
<span>\(T\)</span> is receiver temperature, <span>\(B\)</span> is the noise bandwidth and <span>\(F\)</span> is noise figure
of the receiver. It's a common mistake to confuse the noise bandwidth <span>\(B\)</span>
with RF bandwidth, but they are not related to each other. Noise bandwidth is
the minimum bandwidth where receiver can separate noise and signal from each other.
By taking Fourier transform of the input signal, we can discard all the
frequency bins that are beyond the signal we are currently looking at, and
noise at those discarded frequencies won't affect the detection capabilities of
the receiver. FFT resolution resolution is equal to <span>\(1/t_s\)</span>, where <span>\(t_s\)</span> is the
sweep length.</p>
<p>Setting the received power <span>\(P_r\)</span> equal to noise power and solving for
<span>\(\sigma_0\)</span> we get noise equivalent sigma zero (NESZ) that is value often used
for comparing synthetic aperture radars.</p>
<p>$$
\text{NESZ} = \frac{(4 \pi)^3 r^4 k F T}{n \delta x \delta y G^2 \lambda^2 P_t t_s}
$$</p>
<p>The number of pulses in image <span>\(n\)</span> could also be written as <span>\(t_m \text{PRF}\)</span>,
where <span>\(t_m\)</span> is the measurement time and <span>\(\text{PRF}\)</span> is pulse repetition frequency.
Or equivalently <span>\(l_m \text{PRF} / v\)</span>, where <span>\(l_m\)</span> is the length of the flown
track, and <span>\(v\)</span> is the velocity of the drone during measurement. If the antenna
points at a constant angle during measurement (stripmap image) the number of
pulses in the image depends on the time that ground patch is illuminated by the
antenna beam and can be much smaller than the previous number if the antenna beam is
narrow. Quadcopter can easily fly pointing in arbitrary angle and it's possible to
constantly point the antenna at the target (spotlight imaging) and this
limitation doesn't necessarily apply in this case.</p>

<p>Plotting the NESZ as a function of range gives the above plot. There are some
parameters that can be adjusted, mainly sweep length and the number of sweeps in
image to slightly improve this figure. The requires NESZ for good quality image
depends on the actual reflectivity of the ground, but typically for satellite
based SAR NESZ is around -20 dBsm. With these parameters we should expect to see
to around 1 - 2 km with ok image quality.</p>

    6 GHz RF frequency and with different number of time-multiplexed channels.</p>
</div>

<p>Radar image formation relies on the phase information of the received signal.
If we consider a target that is 90 degrees from the antenna beam center (in the
direction of movement) to avoid phase ambiguity, the maximum phase difference
between two adjacent measurements needs to be less than 180 degrees. If the
movement is larger than this, there can be multiple targets at different azimuth
angles that have the same phase difference between measurements causing them to
overlap in the image. Since both transmitter and receiver antennas move,
a distance of a quarter wavelength between two measurements of the same target
results in a half-wavelength difference in the distance traveled by the signal
and a half-wavelength distance difference corresponds to 180-degree phase
difference. At this spacing, targets at ±90 degrees will have the same 180-degree
phase difference between measurements. If the measurement spacing is increased
further more of the image starts to alias.</p>
<p>If the antenna is very directive then it's possible to use larger measurement
spacing. Directive antenna won't radiate to large angles that would alias, and
the more directive the antenna is, the larger the measurement spacing can be.
However, since the drone is space-limited and antenna directivity is related to
its size, it might not be possible to design a very directive antenna causing the
maximum measurement spacing to be around quarter wavelength.</p>
<p>The common flying speed for a quadcopter is around 10 m/s, but flying speed can easily
be decreased if needed. With 6 GHz RF frequency, the quarter wavelength is 12.5
mm (0.5 inches) and 10 m/s flying speed means that pulse repetition frequency
needs to be at least 800 Hz. Since we have time multiplexed four different
polarizations, we need to be able to measure all of them in this time.</p>
<p>PRF sets the requirement for maximum sweep length. With 4 * 800 Hz = 3.2 kHz
PRF requirement this leaves maximum of 312.5 µs per sweep. However, some time
needs to be reserved for time between sweeps due to limited locking time of the
PLL. The locking time of the PLL is around 20 - 30 µs, leaving 280 µs for the
maximum sweep length.</p>
<h2 id="required-adc-sampling-frequency">Required ADC sampling frequency</h2>

    bandwidth for FMCW radar with 250 µs sweep length.</p>
</div>

<p>FMCW radar mixes the received signal with a copy of the transmitted sweep,
resulting in a sine wave signal at the mixer output with frequency depending on
the range to the target. If the target is at distance <span>\(r\)</span>, the IF frequency <span>\(f\)</span>
can be calculated as: <span>\(f = \frac{2 B r}{c t_s}\)</span>, where <span>\(B\)</span> is the bandwidth of
the RF sweep, <span>\(c\)</span> is the speed of light, and <span>\(t_s\)</span> is the sweep length. The
range resolution depends on the RF bandwidth <span>\(B\)</span> as <span>\(\Delta r = \frac{c}{2B}\)</span>.
For example, 150 MHz bandwidth is required for 1 m resolution, and 300 MHz
bandwidth results in 0.5 m resolution.</p>
<p>If we have 300 MHz of RF bandwidth (0.5 m range resolution) and <span>\(t_s\)</span> is 280 µs
as calculated earlier, then we can calculate the required ADC sampling speed
given the maximum target range we want to detect. For example, with 2 km
maximum range, the IF signal frequency is 14 MHz. The ADC sampling frequency
needs to be at least double this due to Nyquist sampling requirement, and some
additional margin is needed for the anti-alias filter roll-off. This results in
a minimum ADC sampling frequency of about 35 MHz. I chose to use 50 MHz
sampling frequency.</p>

</div>

<p>The amount of data and strict timing requirements of the sweep generation make
it difficult to handle with microcontroller and FPGA is necessary.
Microcontroller is useful for more complicated tasks such as communication with the
drone flight controller and ground station, configuring the radar, and writing
the data to a filesystem. I decided to use Zynq 7020 FPGA, the same one
I used in my <a href="https://hforsten.com/homemade-6-ghz-pulse-compression-radar.html">previous pulse radar</a>. It has FPGA fabric 
and a dual-core ARM processor in the same package. This FPGA is nominally 150 EUR
from ordinary distributors, but is available for fraction of that from Chinese
distributors.</p>
<p>The drawback of this FPGA is that the microcontroller doesn't have many high
speed connections. For example SD-card and EMMC interfaces are limited to 25
MB/s, which is below the data rate of the ADC. It does have 1 Gbps Ethernet, but
using that would require adding a Raspberry Pi or similar computer, which
isn't possible due to size constraints. For instance, newer Ultrascale+ FPGAs
support SD-cards with 52 MB/s and EMMC at 200 MB/s speeds, but they cost around
500 EUR and are not available from Chinese low cost distributors.</p>
<p>Zynq can have external DDR3 DRAM, but due to space limitations, it's not
possible to fit enough DRAM to store the whole measurement in memory. With
limitation of only one DDR3 module, the memory is limited to 1 GB, while size of
the measurement can be several gigabytes.</p>
<p>This leaves only the option of implementing fast enough external communication
interface in the programmable logic side of the FPGA. Luckily <a href="https://zipcpu.com/">Dan Gisselquist
(ZipCPU)</a> has made GPL3-licensed <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/sdspi">SD-card and EMMC
controller</a> that supports faster high-speed
communication modes than the hard IP included with the ARM processor.</p>
<p>At the time, sdspi controller hadn't been tested with real hardware at the
speeds I required. To make sure I have something working if I'm unable to get
the sdspi core working I connected the SD-card to the ARM processor's
integrated controller, which is limited to 25 MB/s, and EMMC memory to the
programmable logic side that is used with the sdspi controller. This way I'm
able to at least use the SD-card with the integrated controller if the sdspi
core isn't suitable, but this turned out to be unnecessary and the sdspi
controller worked fine. In future versions, it would be better to also connect
the SD-card to PL side using sdspi core for faster SD-card speeds.</p>
<p>I also added FT600 USB3 bridge IC that can be used to connect FPGA to PC. This
is not needed for drone usage, but allows real-time connection to PC for other
applications.</p>
<div id="centered">

</div>

<p>FPGA functionality is quite simple at the block diagram level. The design
primarily consists of a few independent blocks wired with either DMA or AXI bus
to the processor. For radar operation, the radar timer block is important as it
switches internal and external signals during the measurement. It needs to be
implemented in the FPGA fabric to ensure that the timing is clock cycle accurate
to achieve phase-stable radar measurements. AXI bus is memory-mapped on the
processor side, allowing the radar to be controlled by writing values to fixed
memory addresses.</p>
<p>A decimating FIR filter after ADC data input can be used to change the sample
rate of the ADC data. It can decimate by 1, 2, or 4. For long-range
measurements, the decimation should be disabled for the maximum IF
bandwidth. But for shorter-range measurements it makes sense to use higher
decimation value to decrease the amount of data that needs to be stored.</p>

<p>The PCB has six layers and is designed to be as compact as possible, with
components placed closely together to minimize size. Since one-sided assembly
is cheaper than assembling both sides, the bottom side is empty except for one
SD-card connector that I will solder myself.</p>
<p>As with many of my previous radars, the RF part is a relatively small part of
the PCB and the overall design effort. Digital electronics and voltage regulators
take up the majority of the PCB space.</p>

</div>

<p>The radar is designed to accept input voltage from 12 to 30 V and connect
directly to the drone's battery eliminating the need for an external DC/DC
regulator.</p>
<p>Due to space constraints, there wasn't enough space to fit four SMA connectors
and I didn't want to use any miniature RF connectors. The top two connectors
are switchable TX outputs for H and V polarization antenna inputs, while the
bottom third one is RX input. The RX polarization switch is located on an
external PCB and connects to one of the three four-pin JST connectors on the
bottom right of the PCB. Another JST connectors is for flight controller's
serial port, and the third connector is currently unused, but it could be used to
connect for example GPS.</p>
<p>There are two USB-C connectors: one for JTAG programming and
debugging of the FPGA, and the other connects to USB3 to FIFO bridge chip that enables
fast data transfer to PC. It isn't needed in drone use, but it's useful for
testing and other applications.</p>
<p>PCB dimensions are 113 x 48 mm. Width is just skinny enough to fit on the drone,
while it could have been slightly longer.</p>

</div>

<p>After ordering the PCB I made an order for the components from Mouser. The order
seemed to succeed fine and they accepted my money but I got the above email
afterwards telling me that they can't sell me one of the components. Reason
seems to be that the supplier of the component has forbidden them for selling it
to individuals. This was very frustrating as there was absolutely no warnings on
the website and I had already ordered the PCBs. I was unable to order this
component from anywhere, but I did find older obsolete PE43204 pin compatible IC
from obsolete component reseller. It's specified only for maximum of 4 GHz when
the original was up to 6 GHz but it does seems to have low enough loss at 6 GHz
to not cause too large issues.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rfelectronics/comments/1dubvj7/psemi_forbidding_resellers_from_selling_to/">asking on
reddit</a>
the reason is probably that the manufacturer of the component wants to know who
they are selling to, to avoid their components ending up in defense
applications. That's fine, but it would have been nice to know that in advance.</p>

<p>I did make one mistake: SD-card pins are connected to 1.8 V I/O pins, while they
should be connected to 3.3 V I/O and SD-card didn't work with this lower voltage.
The radar could be used without SD-card by storing the data into EMMC instead
and then reading it through USB, but SD-card would be much easier to use.
I really didn't want to order another PCB to just fix this one mistake and
I managed to fix it by designing a small interposer PCB with level shifter that
I soldered on top of the previous SD-card footprint. I wrote about it in more
detail in a <a href="https://hforsten.com/fixing-incorrectly-wired-sd-card-connector-with-interposer-pcb.html">previous post</a>.</p>

<p>Flight controller came with the drone kit. The included flight controller is
<a href="https://www.speedybee.com/speedybee-f405-v3-bls-50a-30x30-fc-esc-stack/">Speedybee F405
V3</a>.
This is a cheap low-end flight controller with 1 MB of flash. It does the job,
but I would recommend getting a little bit better flight controller with
2 MB of flash, the price difference isn't very large.</p>
<p>There are several possible flight controller softwares. The three most used for
FPV drones are: <a href="https://betaflight.com/">Betaflight</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav">Inav</a>, and
<a href="https://ardupilot.org/">ArduPilot</a>. The main differences of them are:
Betaflight focuses on fast-response manual flying and doesn't have autonomous
flight support, Inav shares lot of code with Betaflight and it includes some
autonomous flight support, and ArduPilot has the most advanced autonomous flight
capability with lot of features but it's more challenging to configure.</p>
<p>I chose to use Ardupilot and found it to be excellent for this purpose. It has
very good IMU and GPS sensor fusion algorithm that is very helpful for
improving the position accuracy. The flight controller can communicate with the
radar through a serial port allowing it to enable and disable the radar during
autonomous mission and provide position information for the radar.</p>
<div id="centered">

    mounted far away from the battery leads to avoid magnetic fields causing issues

</div>

<p>SAR imaging needs very accurate position information for proper image focusing.
Position information should be accurate within to a fraction of wavelength,
this is just few cm (1 - 2 inches) at this frequency. Many commercial SAR
imaging drones use RTK GPS with a second stationary GPS receiver on the ground
it's possible to obtain about 1 cm accurate positioning. The drawback
is that it's much more costly than regular GPS and RTK GPS receivers are
usually much larger than ordinary GPS receivers which makes it very difficult
to fit it in this drone.</p>
<p>Good non-RTK GPS might be accurate to about 1 m accuracy. This large
positioning errors cause significant errors in the image if not corrected.
Luckily, it's possible to solve for position error from the radar data which is
called autofocusing. With drawback of needing more processing during the image
formation for autofocusing, it's possible to use regular GPS. Sensor fusion
with inertial measurement unit (IMU) can be used to improve accuracy of the
positioning and obtain position updates faster than the maximum of about 4 Hz that
is possible with only GPS.</p>
<p>For autonomous flying the drone's flight computer also needs GPS, IMU and
compass. It would be a waste of space to have a second GPS and IMU for just the
radar and instead I'm relying on the flight computer to output its position
estimate to the radar through a serial interface.</p>

<p>The drone is controlled with a radio controller. I use
<a href="https://www.expresslrs.org/">ExpressLRS</a> radio link, which is very common with
FPV drones. The drone also has a radio link to the ground control software
running on PC. This is needed for programming the autonomous mission parameters,
changing drone settings, it can be used to control the drone, and it displays
telemetry during the flight. Ground station can also be used to send messages to
radar through the flight controller and this allows programming the radar
parameters from the laptop.</p>
<p>Typically Ardupilot has required using two radios. One for radio controller and
other for telemetry, but ELRS recently added <a href="https://www.expresslrs.org/software/mavlink/">Mavlink
support</a> that allows using
a single radio for both purposes. This is very convenient in this application.</p>
<h2 id="antennas">Antennas</h2>
<p>In theory, the wider the antenna beam width is, the better the resolution of
SAR image is. <a href="https://topex.ucsd.edu/rs/sar_summary.pdf">A famous result in SAR imaging</a> is that the best possible
cross-range resolution in strip mode SAR (fixed antenna angle and straight
baseline) is <span>\(L/2\)</span>, where <span>\(L\)</span> is the length of the antenna. However, in
practice wider antenna beam isn't often better. Wider antenna beam means lower
gain which decreases the signal to noise ratio and limits the maximum range.
Antenna gain is squared in the link budget so halving the antenna gain, means
that number of pulses need to be quadrupled to get the same SNR.</p>
<p>The cross-range resolution depends on the length of the baseline where the
target is visible and the wider the antenna beam is the longer this is. With
spotlight imaging, where antenna tracks the target, cross-range resolution is
not limited by the antenna beam width and spotlight imaging is easy with drone.
With drone SAR the maximum possible baseline length is often the limiting
factor for resolution as it's hard to fly very long track when limited by
visual line of sight.</p>
<p>The azimuth angle resolution in spotlight imaging mode (or in stripmap mode
where antenna beam always covers the target) can be approximated as: <span>\(\Delta
\theta \approx \lambda/L\)</span>, where <span>\(\lambda\)</span> is wavelength and <span>\(L\)</span> is the length
of the track. Cross-range resolution can be obtained with: <span>\(\Delta
y = 2r \sin(\Delta \theta/2)\)</span>, where <span>\(r\)</span> is distance to the target.</p>
<p>With drone SAR a big issue is how to fit large enough antennas on the drone.
Since the radar is FMCW, separate transmitter and receiver antennas are needed
further decreasing the space per antenna and low TX-RX leakage requires having
some distance between them.</p>
<p>I have previously used <a href="https://hforsten.com/horn-antenna-for-radar.html">self-made horn antennas</a>
with my radars, but they are too big to fit on drone. The whole length of the
horn antenna is 100 mm, and even just the coaxial-to-waveguide transition is 25
mm long. This size makes it impossible to fit on the drone, which has only 50 mm
spacing between propeller tips. My previous horn antenna isn't dual-polarized,
but horn can be made dual-polarized easily by adding two feeds 90 degree apart.</p>
<p>Patch antenna can be made much smaller since they are just copper on a PCB. They
can also be made dual-polarized with two feeds 90 degree apart. However,
a simple patch on 1.6 mm thick FR4 PCB has poor bandwidth, FR4 dielectric
inaccuracy can cause frequency shift, and the gain isn't very high. Gain can be
improved by making an array of patches, but with FR4 substrate the losses in
feeding network increase quickly.</p>
<div id="centered">
    <p><img src="https://hforsten.com/img/sar_fmcw/stacked_patch.svg" width="700" height="220"></p><p>Stacked aperture coupled patch antenna. Side (left) and top (right) views.</p>
</div>

<p>Neither horn nor patch antenna seemed suitable. After reading some scientific
papers I found this <a href="https://digital-library.theiet.org/doi/10.1049/el%3A20010828">dual-polarized slot-fed stacked patch
antenna</a> paper. It
consists of patch antenna that is fed by microstrip lines that couple to patch
through H-shaped slots in the ground plane. Two feed lines and slots 90 degree
apart can be used to make it dual-polarized. A second patch is suspended few mm
away from the first patch with air in between them. This structure can achieve
much wider bandwidth than a single patch making it tolerant to frequency shift
caused by inaccuracy of FR4 permittivity. The second patch also slightly
increases the gain.</p>
<div id="centered">

</div>

<p>However, more gain would be good to have for improving the signal-to-noise
ratio. Sidelobes at 90 degree angle should also be lower to decrease TX-RX
leakage. To solve this I added a sheet metal horn structure around the antenna,
making it a stacked patch fed horn antenna. The horn increases the height by 10
mm, but even just a sheet metal wrapped around the patch gap increases the gain
and decreases sidelobes without increasing the height. I haven't found
a similar structure in any publications, but it wouldn't surprise me if some
exist, as it does seem straightforward.</p>
<p>A pyramidal horn with filled-in corners would likely offer slightly higher gain
and be mechanically stiffer than this four-flap design. However, this was
easier for me to manufacture. I cut the copper sheet by hand with scissors and
soldered it to keep it together.</p>
<p>This antenna has everything I wanted. It's dual-polarized, has very wide
bandwidth, good gain, isn't as tall as similar gain horn antenna fed with
coaxial-to-waveguide transition, and it's cheap to manufacture requiring just
two FR4 PCBs, some copper sheet and few bolts and spacers. FR4 is lossy and gain
would likely be around 0.5 - 1.0 dB higher if a proper low loss RF material was
used, but the cost would be about 100x higher in prototype quantities and it
doesn't make sense for me to spend so much more for so little improvement.</p>
<p>Between the antennas is a small 0.25 x 0.5 wavelength wall that decreases TX-RX
coupling. I tested few different size walls and this small wall is more
effective than no wall and also more effective than taller walls.</p>
<p>Not counting the SMA connectors, the height of the antenna is 18 mm, of which 10
mm is the height of the horn above the suspended patch. Total height including
the SMA connector is 28 mm. Patch substrate dimension is 45 x 45 mm and the horn
aperture is 65 x 65 mm.</p>

    connectors, one for H and other for V polarization.</p>
</div>

<p>Backside of the antennas is covered by copper sheet to decrease the backwards
radiation. This is needed because antennas are mounted right on top of the radar
PCB which doesn't have any shielding. Without shielding TX antenna backwards
radiation would increase the TX-RX coupling. Copper sheet is also inserted into
the wall between antennas and the tape keeps it in place. </p>

<p>The simulated -3 dB beamwidth is 50/60 degrees in 0/90 degree angles. H and
V feed slots are rotated 90 degrees and the radiation pattern from the other
port is similar but rotated 90 degrees. Simulated peak gain is 10.0 dB.</p>
<p>Sidelobe to 90 degree direction is about -10 dB. It's important for this to be
low to minimize TX-RX leakage.</p>
<p>Since the antenna radiation pattern isn't quite symmetrical, mounting the other
antenna at a 90-degree rotation compared to the first one ensures good antenna
pattern matching between HH and VV polarizations. If the TX antenna transmits
H polarization from the first port, RX antenna receives H polarization from the
other port, and other way around for V, causing the two-way antenna pattern to
match between the both cases. However, HV and VH antenna patterns don't match
the HH and VV patterns, since in the cross-polarization case the same port is
used to transmit and receive on both antennas.</p>

</div>

<p>There is a slight difference in the H and V port matching due to their slightly
different coupling slot sizes. Antenna useable bandwidth is from about 4.5 GHz
to 6.2 GHz which is more than enough for this application.</p>

</div>

<p>The drone needs some mechanical parts to hold the radar on the drone frame.  The
flight controller is mounted inside the frame, but there isn't enough room
inside it for the radar, so I designed a 3D printed mount that holds the radar
PCB under the drone frame. This mounting position also requires landing legs so
that the drone doesn't land on the radar. I designed it in Blender since I don't
know any mechanical CAD programs. It works just fine for these simple parts.</p>

</div>

<p>The radar mount holds the radar PCB on the drone frame. It would be a good idea
to have some sort of weather proof enclosure for it, but I haven't got around it
yet. I added some material over the PCB to protect it in case the landing legs
fail.</p>
<p>Radar holder attaches with four screws to the drone. Drone radio controller
antenna is visible at the bottom left. Propellers are collapsible, these make it
much easier to transport the drone as with these it fits in a backpack.</p>

<p>Antenna board is held with two bolts that allow its angle to be changed. Flight
controller serial port is attached to one of the JST connectors. There also
other JST connector from flight controller that is currently unused and just
held with tape in place.</p>
<p>Transmitter has polarization switch and two SMA connectors on the PCB, but the
receiver polarization switch is on a separate PCB due to lack of space. I had
a mounting holes for it on the radar holder part, but the SMA cables are stiff
enough that I found it easier to just leave it hanging there. Polarization
switch connects to the radar PCB with another JST connector.</p>

<p>Landing legs are 10 cm diameter carbon tubes with 3D printed TPU caps. Smaller
diameter tube would have likely been fine, these are very stiff and something
else would fail before them if they are stressed too much in landing.</p>
<p>Radar is powered directly from the drone battery. XT60 splitter is used to
connect both flight controller and radar to the same battery.</p>

<p>Weight of the drone without battery is just 752 grams (1.66 lbs). I have two six

the bigger 2200 mAh battery weights 322 grams. With the smaller battery the total
weight of the whole system is just 948 grams.</p>
<h2 id="image-formation">Image formation</h2>
<p>Radar measures the distance and phase of each target. To convert these
measurements into a radar image, matched filtering can be used. For each pixel
in the image, generate a reference signal corresponding to what a target at that
position would reflect. Multiply the measured signal with the complex conjugate
of the reference signal for each measurement, then sum these products over
all measurements. When the measured signal closely matches the reference signal,
their product becomes large because the phases align. If it doesn't match,
the result of the multiplication is a complex number with a random phase, and summing
random complex numbers will average out generating a low response.</p>
<p>The image formation can be written as:</p>
<p>$$I = \sum_{p \in \mathcal{P}} \sum_{n=1}^N S_n(d(p,x_n)) \cdot H(d(p,x_n))^* $$</p>
<p>, where <span>\(\mathcal{P}\)</span> is the set of pixels in the image, <span>\(N\)</span> is the number of
radar measurements, <span>\(S_n\)</span> is Fourier transformed measured IF signal <span>\(s_n\)</span>,
<span>\(d(p,x_n)\)</span> is the distance to location of pixel <span>\(p\)</span> from radar position at that
measurement <span>\(x_n\)</span>, and <span>\(H^*\)</span> is complex conjugate of the reference function of
what target at that position in the image should look like (Fourier transform of
the radar IF signal from target at that position in the image).</p>
<p>This is called backprojection algorithm. It's simple and doesn't make any
approximations or assumptions about flight geometry, but it's very demanding to
calculate. For example with 1 km x 1 km image with 0.3 m resolution and 10,000
radar sweeps, calculating the image needs <span>\((1000/0.3)^2 \cdot 10000 = 111 \cdot
10^9\)</span> backprojections. This means over 100 billion complex exponentials and
square root calculations is needed for one image, and image size and number of
sweeps can be even larger in practice. There are some clever algorithms that can
be used to speed this up, but they often have approximations or only work with
linear flight tracks. One easy improvement that can be made without many
drawbacks, is to use polar coordinates instead of Cartesian coordinates, as that
requires less pixels in the image since angular resolution is constant while
cross-range resolution is better closer to the radar. Polar coordinate image can
then be afterwards interpolated to Cartesian grid.</p>

<p>Some years ago this would have been unbelievable amount of compute, but with
modern GPU this can be calculated in under a second. This problem is especially
well suited for GPU implementation since every pixel can be calculated
independently in parallel. Very straightforward CUDA kernel is able to calculate
220 Billion backprojections per second on RTX 3090 Ti GPU. This is very
respectable speed considering that each backprojection requires square root and
complex exponential (which can be calculated with just sin and cos). I'm sure
that someone experienced with CUDA programming could make this even faster as
this doesn't have any optimizations or approximations and is just the direct
algorithm implementation.</p>
<h2 id="autofocus">Autofocus</h2>
<div id="centered">
    <p><img src="https://hforsten.com/img/sar_fmcw/autofocus.svg" width="639" height="879"></p><p>Autofocus block diagram.</p>
</div>

<p>Positioning accuracy of the GPS and IMU isn't good enough to form a high-quality
image. Ideally, the position should be known to a fraction of the wavelength,
but accuracy of the GPS isn't good enough. To achieve good image quality, an
autofocus algorithm is necessary to focus the radar image using information from
the radar data.</p>
<p>The most commonly used autofocus algorithm is <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/303752">phase gradient
autofocus</a>. It's simple
and fast autofocus algorithm that works by taking an unfocused radar image as an
input and solving for a phase vector that when multiplied with the azimuth FFT
of the image gives a focused image. However, it doesn't work well in this case
since the azimuth beam is wide and the radar baseline is long causing the
focusing errors to be spatially dependent.</p>
<p>I updated my <a href="https://hforsten.com/backprojection-backpropagation.html">previous backpropagation autofocus</a> to
use PyTorch and made some improvements. This autofocus algorithm works by
forming the radar image, calculating the gradient of the input velocity, and 
clipping the learning rate to limit the maximum position change to a predefined
value. The input velocity is then updated using a gradient descent optimizer.
I found that using a 3D position doesn't work well, as it often tends to just nudge
each position in random directions. Instead, using velocity and integrating it
to position seems to yield much better results. A small regularization term is
also included to minimize the distance between the optimized and original
positions, favoring smaller updates.</p>
<p>Adjusting the learning rate based on the maximum position change makes it easier
to set the optimizer meta parameters. Instead of setting the learning rate
directly, maximum position update is given which is used to set the learning
rate.</p>
<p>This is very general autofocus algorithm that makes no assumptions about the
radar system, scene, or the flight track. The obvious disadvantage is that it
requires forming the radar image many times making the already slow image
formation many times slower. Without the fast GPU image formation this would be
too slow to be useful.</p>
<p>The autofocus algorithm is available on
<a href="https://github.com/Ttl/torchbp">Github</a>.</p>

    Planner.</p>
</div>

<p>The mission is programmed beforehand with the ArduPilot Mission Planner. The
drone will automatically fly the programmed waypoints, there are also commands
to set the ROI (region of interest) so that antenna always points towards it,
and the radar measurement is started with digicam configure command in the
mission. It's originally meant for configuring ordinary camera, but
I programmed the radar microcontroller to listen to it. Using an existing
command makes it easy to make the radar work with the existing ArduPilot software.</p>
<p>Setting ROI, which is needed for spotlight imaging, needs a patch to ArduPilot
firmware. By default drone's front will always point towards the ROI and there
isn't a way to configure it to point the antenna towards ROI instead. The patch
is available on the <a href="https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/pull/28486">ArduPilot Github as a pull request</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>The scene is a wide open field. There's about 1.5 km distance to the forest at
the antenna pointing direction. The drone flies at 110 m altitude in a straight
line for about 500 m at 5 m/s velocity. The radar was configured to transmit
only VV polarization with 400 µs long sweep, 500 MHz bandwidth, and 1 kHz
pulse repetition frequency.</p>

</div>

<p>The range compressed (Fourier transformed) captured data doesn't look very
impressive. It doesn't look anything like an image since due to the wide
antenna beam at each sweep many targets at different angles are captured.</p>
<p>At the zero distance there is a large response from the TX-RX leakage, then the
next reflection is at 100 m distance from the ground. Even though the antenna
gain at directly below is much smaller than at the beam center, due to the angle
of the reflection and close distance, the reflection from directly below is very
large. At large distances reflections are mostly below the noise floor of
individual sweeps, but during image formation many sweeps are integrated
improving the signal to noise ratio. Some large individual objects are visible
and their distance to the radar changes as the drone moves.</p>

</div>

<p>Ideally the track should have been a straight line but there
is some disturbances due to for example wind. The drone is very light and even
a slight wind can easily affect it. The ROI was set quite far away there is only
few degree of change in the antenna pointing direction during the measurement.</p>

</div>

<p>Above is the processed SAR image without autofocus in pseudo-polar coordinates
that the image formation uses internally. It's pseudo-polar because angle axis
is in sine of radians instead of just radians, this is slightly more efficient
than ordinary polar coordinates. Image size is 6k x 20k pixels using 51,200
sweeps.</p>
<p>Compared to the raw data it's a night and day. Various geographical features can
be now identified, but polar format makes it hard to compare to the map.</p>

</div>

<p>Cartesian coordinate image can be obtained by projecting the pseudo-polar image
to Cartesian grid. This is very fast operation compared forming the image
directly on the Cartesian grid. The image is also aligned so that north points
up using the drone's electronic compass measurements. Left corner is missing
a small patch of data due to the rotation.</p>
<p>The resulting image is still quite blurry. Clearly only relying on the GPS and
IMU positioning isn't good enough and autofocus is needed to get a sharply
focused image.</p>
<div id="centered">

</div>

<p>After applying 30 iterations of the minimum entropy gradient optimization
autofocus, the image quality is much better. Five iterations would have been
probably enough, but using more iterations does improve the quality slightly.
This does take several minutes since each iteration requires calculating forward
and backwards pass of the backprojection.</p>
<p>Due to the low look angle, tall structures such as trees cast long shadows. The
image amplitude isn't normalized, which is why it's brighter closer to the
origin.  The antenna radiation pattern can be also visualized in the image. The
beam center is tilted slightly to the right, and the antenna gain at the left
side of the image is much smaller due to it being farther from the beam center,
causing it to be dimmer.</p>

    (left) and with minimum entropy optimization autofocus (right).</p>
</div>

<p>There is quite lot of detail in the resulting radar image when zooming in.
Comparing a 300 x 300 m patch, the autofocused image reveals surface details of
the field that was just blur in the image without autofocus.</p>
<p>I also tried using phase gradient autofocus, but it doesn't work well in this
case. <a href="https://hforsten.com/img/sar_fmcw/sar2_pga_detail.jpg">The result</a> is very similar to
the image without autofocus.</p>
<p>The three lines at the bottom left are power lines. They seem to be only visible
in the image when the radar is looking at them at 90 degree angle, at other angles
the reflectivity is so low that they are invisible.</p>

</div>

<p>Comparing the drone velocity before and after optimization the changes aren't
very large. Along the track and range direction velocity components are both
adjusted slightly and height direction velocity component is basically
unchanged.</p>

</div>

<p>I also made another measurement at other location using all four polarizations.
The radar flies a linear track autonomously as before, but now the radar quickly
switches between each of the four polarization switch states. Sweep length was
reduced to 200 µs, pulse repetition frequency is 715 Hz for each
polarization, and other parameters are kept the same. Number of sweeps in the
image is the same 51,200.</p>
<div id="centered">

</div>

<p>The four polarizations look very similar. The main differences are that
cross-polarization images (HV and VH) have weaker amplitude due to
cross-polarization component in general being smaller than the reflection of the
same polarization.</p>
<div id="centered">
    <p><img src="https://hforsten.com/img/sar_fmcw/xsar3_pol_1100.jpg.pagespeed.ic.sZ46cglYon.jpg" width="905" height="854"></p><p>Polarized SAR image with autofocus.</p>
</div>

<p>Instead of looking at four different images for each polarization, it's common
to use RGB color channels for different polarizations in the same image. In this
colored image it's easier to visualize how each target reflects specific
polarizations. The ground is tinted purple, indicating that it
reflects VV and HH polarization better than the cross-polarized components. The same
can be seen on the buildings and in the light poles along the road. Forest areas
are colored white as they reflect all polarizations about equally. However,
since the effects of the antenna radiation pattern and possibly slightly
different losses for different polarization switch states are not calibrated
some of the observed differences could be attributed to the hardware. Better
accuracy measurements would require calibration.</p>
<p>The area with bunch of points around (200, 500) meters is a some kind of garden

<p>There was slight amount of snow on the ground during the measurements. The
visible picture is from the top of the SAR image looking down. The small forest
on the left is the small patch of trees in the middle of the image.</p>

</div>

<p>The previous measurements synthesized one high-resolution image from a long
baseline. It's also possible to synthesize many images with small baselines from
one long measurement, and these many images can then be turned into a video.</p>
<p>For the backprojection algorithm, the flight track doesn't need to be linear and for
this case I programmed the drone to fly octagonal track while pointing the
antenna at the octagon's center.</p>

</p>

<p>Each frame has 1024 radar sweeps with 512 of them overlapping with the previous
frame.  Since each frame has less sweeps than the previous full images, the
frames are noisier and have worse angular resolution. The video is sped up by
about 10x. All four polarizations are used, and the image colorization is the
same as in the previous polarized SAR image.</p>
<p>Frames are autofocused separately and there isn't any alignment of adjacent
frames, which causes the frames slightly wobble or jump around occasionally. Corners
of the octagon are especially challenging for the image formation since both
along- and cross-range positions need to be solved accurately for a good-quality
image. Angular resolution can also vary between frames as the baseline
length between the frames can vary, as only the number of sweeps is the same
between the frames.</p>
<p>Natural targets such as the ground and forest look very similar at different frames,
but at several points in the video large reflections can be seen for example at
bridge and power lines when they are oriented at a 90-degree angle to the radar.
The bright spot that looks like it's moving at the bridge is just glint from the
railing. The mismatch between antenna patterns of different polarizations is
also visible as the same target can have slightly different color at the beam
center or at the edge.</p>

<div id="centered">
    <p><img src="https://hforsten.com/img/sar_fmcw/look_angle.svg" width="720" height="450"></p><p>Radar look angle with 120 m flying height.</p>
</div>

<p>Without special permits, it's allowed to fly the drone at a maximum altitude of
120 m. Usually, for SAR imaging, the look angle is around 10 to 50 degrees. If the
look angle is close to 90 degrees (i.e., looking straight down at the ground), the
reflected power is high, but the range resolution is poor as the distance to the
radar is almost the same for nearby locations. For low look angles the range
resolution is good, but due to the low grazing angle the reflected power back to
the radar is low. With extremely low look angle the reflected power can be about
10 to 20 dB lower than it would be compared to more usual around 45 degree look
angle reducing the maximum distance the radar can see.</p>
<p>Another issue is shadowing caused by tall objects.  For instance, when flying at
120 m height, the grazing angle at 2 km distance is only 3.4 degrees. A 10
m tall tree casts 170 m long shadow at this low angle, making it impossible to
see any reflections from the ground after the tall object. This is clearly
visible in all of the measurements. Especially in the full-polarization
measurement only the tops of the buildings are visible at long distances.</p>

<p>The synthetic aperture radar drone can image at least up to 1.5 km and likely
even farther if flown higher. It weighs under 1 kg including the radar, drone,
and battery. The system can capture HH, HV, VH, and VV polarizations.
A gradient-based minimum entropy autofocus algorithm is capable of producing
good good-quality images with a wide antenna beam using only non-RTK GPS and IMU
sensor information. The total cost of the drone was about 200 EUR, 600 EUR for
two radar PCBs, and about 10 months of my free-time after work. I'm very happy
with the performance of the system considering its low cost.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Kaine moved into Golden Gate Park sometime in the late 1990s. He’s vague on the date or details that led to him living outside. But he remembers exactly what he brought with him: “a big-ass backpack,” two sleeping bags, and a 12-person Coleman tent that was so hard to set up he got thoroughly drenched his first night.&nbsp;</p><p>Kaine, whose real name is Kevin Horton, settled into the woods surrounding <a href="https://sfrecpark.org/871/Golden-Gate-Park---Hellman-Hollow">Hellman Hollow</a>. For more than 20 years, no one could figure out how to help him get a real roof over his head. Kaine became a fixture of the park, known by locals for carrying a staff he’d carved from fallen trees, accompanied by his yellow Lab, Honey. He knew all the park’s hidden trails, the best places to pick blackberries “as big as my pinkie finger,” and the hive in an old cypress where he could collect honey to mix with his vodka. People would tell him, “Damn, Kaine, you know more about that park than the park rangers do,” he recalls.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>It was a semi-wild way of life. While most of his food came from Safeway, he occasionally caught fish in Metson Lake to grill, or made stew from raccoons or squirrels caught by Honey. He used the park’s restrooms when they were open and kept a bucket by his tent for when they weren’t.</p><p>He was sometimes friendly and chatty, sometimes ranty. And he was always deeply protective of the meadow, alerting the gardeners to trees that needed trimming or warning parents to keep their kids away from the poisonous hemlock on the hillsides. Late one night, he discovered a naked woman sitting on the curb. He gave her a sweatshirt, let her sleep in his tent while he slept outside, and, in the morning, went to the police at the horse stables so they could call her parents.&nbsp;In turn, many who played in the meadow looked after him, sharing food from picnics and barbecues.&nbsp;</p></div><figure id="" data-align="wide"><div><p><span><span></span><img alt="Two people walk along a path in a park, surrounded by tall trees.

Recreation and Parks Department rangers would cite him and tell him to move. The department’s environmental services crew, who clear abandoned campsites, would tear down his tent when he was out and haul away his possessions. Members of the<a href="https://hsh.sfgov.org/services/the-homelessness-response-system/outreach/homeless-outreach-team/"> Homeless Outreach Team</a>, or HOT, the city program that controls access to shelter beds, would occasionally stop by and ask Kaine if he wanted a placement. His answer was always an emphatic no. Hellman Hollow was his home.&nbsp;</p><p>In March 2021, a woman named Amanda Barrows became a park ranger, joining a special detail focused on unhoused people. Inevitably, that meant dealing with Kaine, who by then was nearing 60. Barrows slowly learned that he’d had a rough childhood and had grown up in a foster family. The park was his childhood refuge, a place where he’d spend afternoons wandering around and riding the carousel. She understood then why he had such a deep attachment to the place.&nbsp;</p><p>For Barrows, trying to forcibly remove Kaine from Golden Gate Park seemed both ineffective and cruel. “I was like, clearly this is not working. He rebuilds, he comes back. What we’re doing is harming this person who’s obviously just stuck.

A welter of problems can make someone chronically homeless: addiction, mental illness, disabilities, trauma, poverty, not to mention failures of the system. None are easily or quickly solved, even after the person is housed. To do more than just clear a person off the sidewalk demands persistence, patience, coordination of services, and intense personal engagement. Which raises the difficult question: If this is what it takes to help one person, can the city find the resolve to help the thousands living rough?&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of applying force to get Kaine out of the park, Barrows offered a helping hand. She embarked on a slow campaign of earning his trust and shepherding him through what one Recreation and Parks Department official described as the “arduous and achingly bureaucratic tasks” necessary just to be eligible for housing. </p><p>Kaine had no ID. All of his required public documents, from a birth certificate to criminal records, were under a different name, and they all had to be aligned to move his housing applications forward. Getting everything in order meant trips to various agencies — and the only way to ensure Kaine went was if someone accompanied him: either a member of HOT or Barrows and another ranger who was her partner at the time. Even then, Kaine repeatedly balked. For him, “it was overwhelming,” Barrows recalled.&nbsp;</p><p>All the while, she tried to help him see that leaving the park didn’t mean losing his connection to it. “This can still be your home, but just in a different way,” she’d tell him. He could gain the comforts of living indoors and still enjoy the park. “It can be like a choice, something you come and go from, versus something you’re stuck in.”</p></div><figure id="" data-align="wide"><div><p><span><span></span><img alt="A person dressed in dark clothing and a beanie walks with a wooden staff beside a calm pond, surrounded by trees and greenery." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="responsive" sizes="(min-width: 1001px) 800px, (min-width: 768px) 100vw, 100vw" srcset="https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162025_ggphomeless_aar_97-3.jpg?w=640&amp;q=75 640w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162025_ggphomeless_aar_97-3.jpg?w=750&amp;q=75 750w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162025_ggphomeless_aar_97-3.jpg?w=768&amp;q=75 768w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162025_ggphomeless_aar_97-3.jpg?w=828&amp;q=75 828w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162025_ggphomeless_aar_97-3.jpg?w=1024&amp;q=75 1024w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162025_ggphomeless_aar_97-3.jpg?w=1080&amp;q=75 1080w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162025_ggphomeless_aar_97-3.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=75 1200w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162025_ggphomeless_aar_97-3.jpg?w=1920&amp;q=75 1920w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162025_ggphomeless_aar_97-3.jpg?w=2048&amp;q=75 2048w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162025_ggphomeless_aar_97-3.jpg?w=3840&amp;q=75 3840w" src="https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162025_ggphomeless_aar_97-3.jpg?w=3840&amp;q=75" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div><figcaption>Kaine looks over Lloyd Lake.

Barrows and her partner helped him pack and hauled his two suitcases — heavy with gear, broken electronics, and sticks and rocks he’d collected in the park — up to his fifth-floor room. They helped him settle in by donating furniture and clothes, including the boots and pants worn by rangers.&nbsp;“We knew that’s what it was going to take to make it happen,” Barrows said.&nbsp;</p><p>But when they went back the next day to check on him, Kaine was gone. Barrows had a hunch about where to find him. She drove to Hellman Hollow, to the last spot where he’d had a tent. He was lying under the bushes, barely conscious and near-frozen from the previous night’s pelting rain. He had left the shelter, he later explained, because “some idiot began smart-mouthing me, and I felt like I was going to punch his head off. I didn’t. I went back home.”&nbsp;</p><p>Barrows called an ambulance. Kaine fought the EMTs when they tried to sedate him for the trip to the hospital, but when she visited him at the navigation center a few days later, he was back to his genial self. He told her with a chuckle, “I’m not doing that again.”&nbsp;</p><p>And he hasn’t.&nbsp;</p></div><div id=""><figure id="" data-align="center"><div><p><span><span></span><img alt="A decorative line." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="responsive" sizes="(min-width: 1001px) 600px, (min-width: 768px) 700px, 100vw" srcset="https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/decorative_break.png?w=640&amp;q=75 640w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/decorative_break.png?w=750&amp;q=75 750w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/decorative_break.png?w=768&amp;q=75 768w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/decorative_break.png?w=828&amp;q=75 828w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/decorative_break.png?w=1024&amp;q=75 1024w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/decorative_break.png?w=1080&amp;q=75 1080w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/decorative_break.png?w=1200&amp;q=75 1200w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/decorative_break.png?w=1920&amp;q=75 1920w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/decorative_break.png?w=2048&amp;q=75 2048w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/decorative_break.png?w=3840&amp;q=75 3840w" src="https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/decorative_break.png?w=3840&amp;q=75" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div><figcaption><span><span>Source: </span>Illustration by The Standard</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>The number of unhoused people living in city parks is a <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2024/05/31/golden-gate-park-homeless-population-seeks-privacy/">tiny fraction</a> of the city’s 8,000-person homeless population, numbering in the few dozens at most. According to the city’s <a href="https://app.powerbigov.us/view?r=eyJrIjoiY2FmZDNiY2ItMjA2OS00YjU5LWFkMDUtODlkNTgyZmQ3MmNhIiwidCI6IjIyZDVjMmNmLWNlM2UtNDQzZC05YTdmLWRmY2MwMjMxZjczZiJ9">quarterly counts of homeless people’s tents and vehicles</a>, which fluctuate considerably, there were nine tents and 32 vehicles in Golden Gate Park in February 2021 and just one tent and five vehicles in January of this year. But while the numbers are small, the rangers field complaints related to homelessness on a daily basis.</p><p>Historically, the rangers dealt with unhoused people by making them move along and issuing citations. Most times, the person would simply pack up their things and move to another spot in the park. It was “a really bad game of hide-and-seek,” said Barrows.</p><p>In 2015, Rec and Parks decided to tackle the issue another way and created the special ranger detail devoted to homeless outreach. “This approach aims to balance enforcement with compassionate outreach,” said department spokesperson Tamara Aparton. The outreach rangers work with city and private agencies to connect people living in San Francisco’s 220 parks with services they need:&nbsp;a shelter bed or permanent housing, medical or mental health care, a detox program, a bus ticket home, a new ID. The hope is that every bit of assistance will move someone closer to stable housing.&nbsp;</p></div><div><figure><blockquote><p>‘They’re in the parks because they want to be away from people. They don’t want to be all on top of each other.’</p><cite>Amanda Barrows</cite></blockquote></figure></div><div><p>The approach is similar to a <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/homeless-castro-district-encampment-17770957.php">pilot program</a> the city deployed in the Castro in 2022. Caseworkers and Public Health employees worked intensively with 34 chronically unhoused people. After five months, all had accepted services they’d long resisted.&nbsp;</p><p>Barrows, 32, is the more senior of the two outreach rangers on the detail and knows first-hand the precarities that can land someone on the streets. She grew up in public housing in a Boston suburb and moved to San Francisco at 19 “with $200 and two bags.” For five years, she lived in “a dodgy SRO,” and for another five years, she was “transient without a permanent address.” Her father died of a fentanyl overdose in 2021, the same year she became a park ranger.&nbsp;“I can relate to a lot of the people who I contact through my own lived experience.”&nbsp;</p><p>She understands why people resent the squalor of street tent sites and is sympathetic to the park gardeners’ complaints about having to clean up garbage, human waste, and drug paraphernalia. Still, she doesn’t believe in treating homelessness as a criminal activity. It’s a complicated stance for someone whose primary responsibility is enforcing the codes against camping and other laws meant to ensure the city’s parks feel safe. Each day, Barrows struggles to find the right balance between cop and caseworker.&nbsp;</p></div><figure id="" data-align="wide"><div><p><span><span></span><img alt="A person in a uniform is seated in a car, holding a smartphone and speaking.

The number of encampments in Golden Gate Park has decreased 10-fold since 2017, though Aparton says it’s not clear to what extent that’s due to the outreach rangers.&nbsp;</p><p>Barrows by all accounts has taken the job further than any of her predecessors, winning praise from her bosses. In nominating her for a departmental award in 2021, the late director of operations Denny Kern applauded “her innate ability to connect and sincerely engage with people” as her “superpower” that enables her to help unhoused people. “Rec and Parks — and all of San Francisco — is lucky to have her,” says Phil Ginsburg, general manager of the department.&nbsp;</p><p>Barrows estimates that since 2021, she has helped 50 to 60 people accept services that enabled them to leave the park. Not everyone followed a straight line to housing, but of the 28 long-timers living in the park when she became a ranger, more than half are now indoors. In 2024, she and outreach ranger Robert Ramey helped eight park residents get housed.</p></div><figure id=""><div><p><span><span></span><img alt="A smiling man in a hoodie and a woman in a uniform share a light moment outdoors, looking at a phone with a wooden-patterned case on a picnic table." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="responsive" sizes="(min-width: 1001px) 600px, (min-width: 768px) 700px, 100vw" srcset="https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162025_ggphomeless_aar_71-1.jpg?w=640&amp;q=75 640w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162025_ggphomeless_aar_71-1.jpg?w=750&amp;q=75 750w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162025_ggphomeless_aar_71-1.jpg?w=768&amp;q=75 768w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162025_ggphomeless_aar_71-1.jpg?w=828&amp;q=75 828w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162025_ggphomeless_aar_71-1.jpg?w=1024&amp;q=75 1024w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162025_ggphomeless_aar_71-1.jpg?w=1080&amp;q=75 1080w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162025_ggphomeless_aar_71-1.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=75 1200w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162025_ggphomeless_aar_71-1.jpg?w=1920&amp;q=75 1920w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162025_ggphomeless_aar_71-1.jpg?w=2048&amp;q=75 2048w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162025_ggphomeless_aar_71-1.jpg?w=3840&amp;q=75 3840w" src="https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162025_ggphomeless_aar_71-1.jpg?w=3840&amp;q=75" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div><figcaption>Kevin Hanson reacts to Barrows' photo of a baby raccoon Jan. 17.<span> | </span><span><span>Source: </span>Amanda Andrade-Rhoades/The Standard</span></figcaption></figure><figure id=""><div><p><span><span></span><img alt="Two hands rest on a weathered, paint-spattered green table.

For instance, there used to be two HOT workers assigned to city parks, which allowed them to quickly respond to calls for help from outreach rangers. That’s no longer the case. Now, she says, if she meets an unhoused person who wants shelter and calls HOT, it can take up to 72 hours for someone to get out to the park. By then, the person has often moved. She has to find them and start the process all over again.&nbsp;</p></div><div id=""><figure id="" data-align="center"><div><p><span><span></span><img alt="A decorative line." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="responsive" sizes="(min-width: 1001px) 600px, (min-width: 768px) 700px, 100vw" srcset="https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/decorative_break.png?w=640&amp;q=75 640w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/decorative_break.png?w=750&amp;q=75 750w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/decorative_break.png?w=768&amp;q=75 768w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/decorative_break.png?w=828&amp;q=75 828w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/decorative_break.png?w=1024&amp;q=75 1024w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/decorative_break.png?w=1080&amp;q=75 1080w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/decorative_break.png?w=1200&amp;q=75 1200w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/decorative_break.png?w=1920&amp;q=75 1920w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/decorative_break.png?w=2048&amp;q=75 2048w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/decorative_break.png?w=3840&amp;q=75 3840w" src="https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/decorative_break.png?w=3840&amp;q=75" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div><figcaption><span><span>Source: </span>Illustration by The Standard</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Another park dweller Barrows dealt with shows just how hard that process can be. Ronnie Morrisette became homeless in 2004, when he was 18, after the grandfather who raised him died and the family home in Ingleside was sold. He’d been in and around the park for more than a decade, and liked it. “It’s the closest thing we San Francisco kids will ever see to nature,” he says. He’s a compact, muscular man, who can be funny and charming and also suspicious and volatile in ways that make him his own worst enemy.&nbsp;</p><p>Barrows met Morrisette in 2021, when he was living in the woods near the archery field. He immediately made clear that he had no interest in pursuing housing. He said he was “on a spiritual quest.” As he later told me, he liked the freedom of living outside. It tested his abilities and kept his racing mind busy, the same thing he felt when he smoked crystal meth or, as a kid, swallowed ADHD drugs.</p></div><figure id="" data-align="wide"><div><p><span><span></span><img alt="A person in a plaid shirt and jeans walks through a lush, green forest with a dog sniffing the ground nearby.

But congregate shelters, where dozens, if not hundreds, sleep cheek-by-jowl in barracks-style beds,&nbsp;are usually out of the question for the people she works with. “They’re in the parks because they want to be away from people. They don’t want to be all on top of each other.”</p><p>She didn’t cite Morrisette at that first meeting (though later she would), which surprised him, since he was used to being hassled by rangers. Even more surprising was that she asked if&nbsp;he needed help. “Amanda was the first park ranger I heard saying that spiel,” he recalls.&nbsp;</p><p>Her chief goal was to establish a rapport with him, as she had with Kaine. “You have to actually dig in and build relationships with these people and understand their needs,” she says. She offered help in small doses: She let him charge his phone in her truck, gave him trash bags to clean up his campsites, and provided a DMV voucher so he could get an ID to use for food stamps and other benefits.&nbsp;</p><p>She’d scour thickets in the park to find his campsite and do wellness checks. She’d invite him to join her while she patrolled areas on foot, or to help her pick up trash. She found he liked to engage in “meaning-of-life existential conversations.” He told her he’d once hoped to be in law enforcement until a felony conviction closed off that option. She encouraged him to apply to be a park ranger.&nbsp;</p></div><div><figure><blockquote><p>‘It’s almost like he’s just blinded by rage or emotions or upset. And you can’t really do much other than watch, because if you try to forcibly intervene, it escalates.’</p><cite>Amanda Barrows</cite></blockquote></figure></div><div><p>When Morrisette’s tent site got too messy or drew complaints, she’d let him know he had to move but gave him time to pack up his things, knowing he’d likely find another site nearby. Still, she couldn’t always protect him from sweeps by the environmental services crew. When that happened, she would sympathize with his rage and frustration over the loss of his things. Soon enough, though, he’d have a new tent, sleeping bags, blankets, suitcases, pots, pans, bikes, tools, and all manner of other stuff, and his campsite would be sprawling again.&nbsp;</p><p>The cycle was exhausting, and it would take more than two years to break. The first hint of change came in July 2022, when Morrisette agreed to get an assessment through the city’s <a href="https://ecs-sf.org/adult-coordinated-entry/">coordinated entry system</a>, the first step in seeking long-term housing. Barrows accompanied him to the Adult Coordinated Entry office on 10th Street but wasn’t permitted to sit in as he filled out a survey used to determine how urgently someone needs housing. She worried that he was so accustomed to the threats of living outside that he would mark “no” on questions about whether he was in danger or had experienced violence. Whatever the reasons, he failed to qualify for priority status, which would have put him on a fast track to a placement in housing.</p><p>Barrows was disappointed; Morrisette saw it as confirmation of his belief that he would never be helped by the system.</p></div><figure id="" data-align="wide"><div><p><span><span></span><img alt="A woman in a rearview mirror holds her forehead, eyes closed, with cars visible through the window.

The asthma that had plagued him since childhood was so bad that some mornings he could barely breathe. Though just 37, he’d been diagnosed with congestive heart failure and was visiting the emergency room several times a month.&nbsp;</p><p>The one bright spot in his life was a puppy a friend had given him, a sweet tan hound with golden eyes whom he named Joi. In a common act for Barrows, she brought Joi a leash and collar, along with dog toys and food.&nbsp;</p><p>By the fall of 2023, Morrisette was taking small steps toward moving inside. He’d undergone another housing assessment and gained priority status. With Barrows’ encouragement, he got himself on the waiting list for transitional housing, a place to live until something more permanent opened up.&nbsp;</p><p>But in early November, Morrisette’s mood plunged. He was coming up on the one-year anniversary of the overdose death of a woman he described as “the love of my life.” One morning, when his asthma was bad, he went to the emergency room at UCSF’s St. Mary’s Hospital, taking Joi with him. Because dogs weren’t allowed, Animal Care and Control was called to hold her at the pound. Morrisette was so distraught he left the hospital, against medical advice, a catheter still in his arm.&nbsp;</p></div><figure id=""><div><p><span><span></span><img alt="A person wearing a brown jacket with a shearling collar is holding a pipe and lighter, appearing to light the pipe with the flame." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="responsive" sizes="(min-width: 1001px) 600px, (min-width: 768px) 700px, 100vw" srcset="https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162025_ggphomeless_aar_47-1.jpg?w=640&amp;q=75 640w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162025_ggphomeless_aar_47-1.jpg?w=750&amp;q=75 750w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162025_ggphomeless_aar_47-1.jpg?w=768&amp;q=75 768w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162025_ggphomeless_aar_47-1.jpg?w=828&amp;q=75 828w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162025_ggphomeless_aar_47-1.jpg?w=1024&amp;q=75 1024w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162025_ggphomeless_aar_47-1.jpg?w=1080&amp;q=75 1080w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162025_ggphomeless_aar_47-1.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=75 1200w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162025_ggphomeless_aar_47-1.jpg?w=1920&amp;q=75 1920w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162025_ggphomeless_aar_47-1.jpg?w=2048&amp;q=75 2048w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162025_ggphomeless_aar_47-1.jpg?w=3840&amp;q=75 3840w" src="https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/12162025_ggphomeless_aar_47-1.jpg?w=3840&amp;q=75" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div><figcaption>Morrisette lights a methamphetamine pipe in Sutro Heights.<span> | </span><span><span>Source: </span>Amanda Andrade-Rhoades/The Standard</span></figcaption></figure><div><p>Barrows found him in the park a few days later, with the catheter still in place. He’d been using it to inject crystal meth. He walked away from her, then veered into the street, directly into the path of a truck. It skidded to a stop, missing him by inches.&nbsp;</p><p>“What are you doing, dude?” Barrows yelled. Morrisette continued across the street. “He flashes,” she says of his now-familiar state of agitation. “It’s almost like he’s just blinded by rage or emotions or upset. And you can’t really do much other than watch, because if you try to forcibly intervene, it escalates.”&nbsp;</p><p>Two days later, Morrisette suffered an overdose from fentanyl. By then he was living in an encampment of RVs and tents on the Lower Great Highway, next to the park.&nbsp;Barrows and one of the RV residents administered Narcan and CPR until an ambulance arrived. The incident shook her deeply. She feared if Morrisette didn’t change his life soon, he would die, either deliberately or accidentally.&nbsp;</p><p>In early 2024, after a punishing series of storms, Barrows helped Morrisette and another resident of the encampment secure placement in a double room in transitional housing. To get the slot, they decided to lie and say they were same-sex partners, even though they were barely friends. But the arrangement didn’t last long. The man got sick and was hospitalized, and a stranger was moved into the room. Morrisette got into a fight with the guy and was kicked out of the facility. He returned to the Lower Great Highway.</p><p>To Barrows, the fault was in the placement, not in Morrisette. “Ronnie was always very clear about his needs. He knows he’s a volatile person. He doesn’t want to be in a shared room, especially with a stranger,” she said.</p><p>Still, his setbacks, and those of Barrows’ other clients, were taking a toll on her. Some days, she admitted, she felt burned out by all the distress she had to witness. “This can be just so exhausting to try to show up fully for so many people every day. And then be a container for all this brokenness.”</p></div><div id=""><figure id="" data-align="center"><div><p><span><span></span><img alt="A decorative line." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="responsive" sizes="(min-width: 1001px) 600px, (min-width: 768px) 700px, 100vw" srcset="https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/decorative_break.png?w=640&amp;q=75 640w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/decorative_break.png?w=750&amp;q=75 750w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/decorative_break.png?w=768&amp;q=75 768w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/decorative_break.png?w=828&amp;q=75 828w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/decorative_break.png?w=1024&amp;q=75 1024w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/decorative_break.png?w=1080&amp;q=75 1080w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/decorative_break.png?w=1200&amp;q=75 1200w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/decorative_break.png?w=1920&amp;q=75 1920w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/decorative_break.png?w=2048&amp;q=75 2048w, https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/decorative_break.png?w=3840&amp;q=75 3840w" src="https://content.sfstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/decorative_break.png?w=3840&amp;q=75" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div><figcaption><span><span>Source: </span>Illustration by The Standard</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Over the course of two months last year, Morrisette endured three more sweeps, was arrested for assault (the charges were later dropped), and then, most crushingly, lost his best friend in a motorcycle accident. The<a href="https://sfstandard.com/2024/03/08/motorcyclist-killed-in-crash-at-golden-gate-park/"> crash happened in Golden Gate Park</a>, and Barrows was again one of the first responders. She, too, had known the crash victim well. Morrisette got the news while he was in jail and called Barrows to find out what had happened. When he got out, she took him to the crash site, and they stood together, mourning.&nbsp;</p><p>In March, there was another sweep of the encampment. Staff from HOT were on site to ask everyone if they wanted shelter. Morrisette began to blow off the HOT worker, as he always did, when Barrows intervened.</p><p>“Just talk to the guy and see what he has to offer,” she urged him. It was a room at the Monarch, a hotel on Geary Street. “Ronnie, that’s one of the best places to go,” she said. It perfectly met his needs: He’d have a single room with a TV and his own bathroom with a shower. There weren’t a ton of rules — and he could bring Joi.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Too tired to keep fighting, Morrisette wearily agreed. He filled two large duffel bags — all he was allowed to bring — and Barrows drove him down to the Monarch. The room was comfortable, but it felt strange to be inside. “I’m going to die in that room,” Morrisette told me a few days after moving in last spring.&nbsp;</p></div><figure id="" data-align="wide"><div><p><span><span></span><img alt="A side mirror view shows a woman talking to a man inside a car.

She was pleased to see how much healthier and stronger he seemed. The longtime cough was gone. “He seemed more relaxed, like his nervous system got a break, like he could rest his head and feel safe at night. It makes a huge difference,” she said. “He wasn’t as angry; he wasn’t as on edge.”</p><p>All seemed to be going well. But in September, Morrisette got into a fight with staff at the Monarch and was evicted. “It was devastating,” Barrows said. Because she was out of town dealing with a family crisis, she couldn’t intervene or help him lodge an appeal.&nbsp;</p></div><div><figure><blockquote><p>‘I’m biased,’ Barrows admitted. ‘But some zero-tolerance policies result in this revolving door that isn’t serving anybody.’</p></blockquote></figure></div><div><p>It angered her that one bout of bad behavior could cost him so dearly. Given his background and mental health issues, the Monarch should have cut him more slack, she thought. “I’m biased,” she admitted. “But some zero-tolerance policies result in this revolving door that isn’t serving anybody.”</p><p>Morrisette was back to living outside, this time in a borrowed RV. It was cramped and decrepit but warmer and drier than a tent. When I asked if he wanted to pursue housing again, he answered, bluntly, “Why would I?”&nbsp;</p><p>With plenty of others who actively wanted help, Barrows let Morrisette slip off her radar. Until last month, when she ran into him again. He was in a bad way. He’d become seriously sick and had such trouble breathing that he’d called for an ambulance himself. He was rushed to Zuckerberg San Francisco General, where doctors found he was so weakened that they put him into an induced coma for nine days to give his body time to recover. While he was in the hospital, his RV was stolen. He told Barrows he was staying with friends, but he hoped she could help him apply again for housing. And of course, she said she would.</p><p>Despite all the obstacles and the ways the system fails people, Barrows knew it’s possible to get even the most intractably unhoused person inside.&nbsp;</p><p>Kaine was proof of that.&nbsp;</p></div><div id=""><div id=""><figure id=""><div><p><span><span></span><img alt="A person bundled in a black hood and camo mask squints in sunlight, holding a wooden stick.

Barrows continued to stay in touch. In early 2024, she learned he was in danger of losing the general assistance benefits that cover his $165 monthly rent due to a bureaucratic snafu. He’d missed two appointments to clear up the problem, and Barrows was determined not to let him miss another.&nbsp;To make sure of that, she accompanied him to the <a href="https://www.sfhsa.org/services/financial-assistance/county-adult-assistance-programs-caap">County Adult Assistance Programs</a> office. “It was so difficult to get him [into supportive housing], the last thing we want is for him to come out and have to restart everything,” she says. “You have to commit to that kind of intensive work.”</p><p>Certainly, it has helped Kaine stay inside.

And though it doesn’t happen as much as he’d like, he still visits Golden Gate Park when he’s able.</p><p>On a recent trip to Hellman Hollow, he stepped onto the meadow, looked around with a smile, and sighed, “Ah, I miss it. And it misses me.”</p></div><figure id="" data-align="wide"><div><p><span><span></span><img alt="A hand holding three small, green, heart-shaped leaves.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<h2>TL;DR: It's all about what data is to be recorded</h2>
<p>There was a time when data structures were made to fit purpose, not compilers. Having a look at the subject, shows clearly the constrains for valid dates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social Security was introduced in 1935.</li>
<li>To be eligible for benefits one had to
<ul>
<li>pay in at least 40 quarters, that's 10 years</li>
<li>be at least 65 years old</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This means the first regular beneficiaries of social security payments were 65 in 1945,  aka of the 1880 cohort. Virtually noone participating in this system can be born before 1880. Anyone older will not most likely not be a beneficiary, and anyone younger (aka still paying in) will be, well, younger.</p>
<p>So add another 5 years for wiggle room and we end at a nice round 1875 as earliest year for any birthday to be recorded.</p>
<p>A perfect rational base for a date entry, isn't it?</p>
<h2>So was it COBOL?</h2>
<p>So in a strict sense, it's not a COBOL issue, but data adapted to task. Of course that's a level of detail hard to communicate with the general public. Since all of that is usually done in COBOL (or as often Assembler), blaming it on COBOL works fine for general public communication (*1). It's also not wrong, as that kind of programming was good practice in COBOL, because it was such back then.</p>
<h2>The Questions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Does or did COBOL default to 1875-05-20 for corrupt or missing dates?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, it does not. The whole thing is about optimized data storage.</p>
<p>An art mostly lost today, where programmers use the most capable type for everything (like float to store bool). Back then one cared not only about process logic, but also optimal implementation in code <em>and</em> data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The claim is sometimes "enhanced" by adding that it defaults specifically to 1875-05-20, the day the Treaty of the Metre was signed, and/or that this is some sort of wisdom exclusive to "old programmers", and of course that it would explain the phenomenon it's trying to explain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. Especially not to a specific day. That would not only be really unusual but would also result in higher programming effort to convert between storage and display.</p>
<p>It being the year of the Meter is just a nice coincidence of a nice round number. See above. (*2)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've unfortunately been unable to find anything technical to back this claim up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No technical detail needed. It's common practice to base dates on some fix points. After all, the all calendar systems are based on some fix point - like 1 AD :)) Or take Unix with its calendar using 1970 as base (*3)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This technical standard for example contains no mention of 1875. And it seems I'm not alone with my inability to back this up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because 1875 makes a lot of sense for social security.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hence my question as a "young programmer": Is there hard evidence of a COBOL specification or implementation that behaves this way?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn't about COBOL or any other data but common sense data structure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the answer is still no, are there some strong arguments for or against the plausibility the claim?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quite contrary. anyone with a minimum knowledge about structuring data will see how this works. Methods like described are common sense.</p>
<h2>So what is it?</h2>
<p>Keep in mind, we talk about a system designed in the 1930s to 50s. That means punch card based, where every character is a premium. Storing a date as 8 characters is an incredible waste. That's why mos commercial application at the time stored dates as 5 characters. 3 for the day (*4) two for the year (*5). They have used worse encoding to save less.</p>
<p>Now, social security needed to cover ages well over 100 years, so defining a sensible cut off year (see above) as 'Year Zero' helps save a whole character. So a birth date can be encoded in 6 characters instead of 8. Three for the day (*4) plus three for year minus 1875.</p>
<p>In turn a not filled date - like when the birth day is unknown, will be empty - which by this logic will output 1875 - at least by reports not taking care of this exception.</p>
<p>Simple, isn't it?</p>
<hr>
<p>*1 - We live in a world not populated by IT-nerds, but people with other preferences, all communicating thru abbreviations. Explaining data issues with 'because data structure' falls short, as self reference isn't an explanation. Likewise any detailed one will sooner or later include COBOL, as COBOL is simply THE language for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_data_processing" rel="noreferrer">EDP</a>, setting als standards - including seeing data as characters (Note, Character != Byte). With that nice key word included, any explanation will be shortened to "because COBOL". If not right away then after being mangled thru headlines, abstracts and squeezed thru 140 character attention span filters.</p>
<p>*2 - This does seem to me quite like the birth of an urban legend. People with no real knowledge poke around with the year, find a fact that seems important and build a story from there on.</p>
<p>*3 - Just wait until those "bright" minds stumble across all those 55 year old in other data bases. all with the same birth day :))</p>
<p>*4 - Either as 3 characters day of year (1..366) or two for day (1..31) and one for Month (A..L).</p>
<p>*5 - Anyone remember Y2k? Yeah, that was mostly about exactly that. Year stored only as two characters leaving the century out. Worked well for the very same reasons as with Social Security. Computerisation only started in the late 1950s. That's +/.- 50 years, quite good to cover all employee (or any other) data without the century.</p>
