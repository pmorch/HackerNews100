                French President Emmanuel Macron the violent clashes that erupted after a teen was shot dead by police last week have been influenced, at least in part, by violent video games.

   <p>Fueled by rage over the police killing of a teenager during a routine traffic stop June, throngs of young people in France have been <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/02/1185705977/france-protests-police-shooting-nahel-paris-marseille">lashing out</a> against alleged racial profiling and calling for greater police accountability. </p>   <p>Over the last week, protesters have lit thousands of cars on fire, attacked schools, town halls, police stations, banks and businesses, and set nearly a thousand buildings ablaze. Some in the Paris suburb of L'Hay-les-Roses rammed a burning car into the mayor's home. Estimates of the damage have been projected to be about <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/04/business/france-riots-businesses-cost/index.html#:~:text=Just%20weeks%20after%20hugely%20disruptive,from%20a%20week%20of%20rioting.">$1.1 billion.</a> As a result, thousands of young people have been arrested since the rioting began in the days after <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/01/1185652168/france-protests-nahel-funeral-nanterre-police">17-year-old Nahel M.</a> was killed on June 27. According to France's Interior Ministry, the average age of those arrested is 17.</p>   <p>The crisis has exposed deep rancor within marginalized and often low-income communities over discrimination —  Nahel is of North African descent<strong> </strong>— and a general lack of opportunity. </p>

   <p>President Emmanuel Macron has mostly blamed social media for the devastation, but he has also claimed that video games have inspired copycat violence and vandalism. </p>   <p>"It sometimes feels like some of them are experiencing, on the streets, the video games that have intoxicated them," Macron <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZM3PcMsIFY">said </a>in a press conference on July 1. </p>   <p>He added that protesters are using Snapchat and TikTok to organize themselves and spread "a mimicking of violence, which for the youngest leads to a kind of disconnect from reality."</p>   <h3>World leaders turn to an outdated explanation </h3>   <p>Concerns that video games promote shootings, massacres or rioting are now about half a century old; it has been traced back to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1976/12/28/archives/death-race-game-gains-favor-but-not-with-the-safety-council.html">1976 release of Death Race,</a> an arcade video game which put players behind the wheel of a car to mow down humanoid figures for points. The argument gained renewed traction in the 1990s with the release of much more realistic first-person shooter games.</p>   <p>It is an old bogeyman that <a href="https://ncac.org/resource/a-timeline-of-video-game-controversies">politicians have latched onto</a> in the wake of horrific tragedies.<strong> </strong>But it has become less common as troves of studies have largely concluded there is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-018-0031-7">no causal link between video games and violent behavior</a>.</p>   <p>Still, that hasn't stopped world leaders from attempting to draw a correlation between the two. Just three months ago, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva blasted video games for "teaching kids to kill." </p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1186401441" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>"I doubt there is a kid of eight, nine, 10, 12 years old, who is not used to spending a great deal of time playing this rubbish," he said at a conference to address hate speech on social networks. (His<strong> </strong>son later apologized for his father's remarks, saying neither he or his siblings had become violent as a result of playing video games.)</p>   <p>In 2019, following <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/08/05/748190808/trump-calls-for-strong-background-checks-following-el-paso-and-dayton-shootings">two mass shootings</a> that happened<strong> </strong>just days apart — one in Dayton, Ohio and another in El Paso, Texas — President Donald Trump told America that "we must stop the glorification of violence in our society."</p>   
   <p>He added, "This includes the gruesome and grisly video games that are now commonplace."</p>   <h3>Experts stress that video games don't cause violent crime</h3>   <p>Christopher Ferguson, a professor at Stetson University in Florida who has studied the impact of such games on the public, said he is surprised at<strong> </strong>Macron's comments. The president is 45 years old and belongs to a generation raised with video games, so "seeing him mention this is almost anachronistic," Ferguson said, sounding perplexed. </p>   <p>"The evidence is very clear. Whatever may be going on in France, whatever violence is occurring, it certainly is not due to violence in video games."</p>   <p>Decades of research, especially long-term experiments spanning decades, have consistently found "that playing violent video games, do not cause even prank-level aggressive behaviors, let alone violent crimes," Ferguson said. </p>   <p>He also noted that the overall violent crime in the U.S. dropped significantly between 1993 and 2020, the same period during which violent video games soared in popularity. </p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1186402087" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>And it's not just in the United States. A <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsos.171474">2019 study</a> out of Oxford University determined that early violent video game playing among<strong> </strong>British teenagers does not predict serious or violent criminal behavior later in life.</p>   <p>According to Ferguson, if video games were the cause of rampant violence, then countries like Japan, South Korea and the Netherlands, which consume more violent video games per capita, would be rife with bloodshed.</p>   <p>"Instead, they're three of the most peaceful countries on the planet in terms of violent crime," he said. </p>   <p>Ferguson explained that factors that can predict violent behaviors tend to be difficult family environments in which there is abuse or neglect, poverty and mental health disorders. "Just being in a bad neighborhood where your opportunities to get ahead and have an equal chance in society seem pretty remote," he said. </p>   <p>They are the sort of issues that require a deep policy and societal changes, he said.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1186403353" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>"You could wave a magic wand and take all these people's video games away, and that's not going to have any effect in any way going to help their lives and reduce their aggression," Ferguson said. </p>   <p>So why do politicians turn to the familiar refrain? Ferguson said it is a way for elected leaders to shift the blame away from failing government policies. </p>   <p>"It gets people talking about the wrong thing. They're thinking about video games. They're not thinking about gun control or whatever inequalities are happening in France," Ferguson said. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">File this one under inevitable but hilarious. Mechanical Turk is a service that from its earliest days seemed to invite shenanigans, and indeed researchers show that nearly half of its “turkers” appear to be using AI to do tasks that were specifically intended to be done by humans because AI couldn’t. We’ve closed the loop on this one; great job everybody!</p>
<p>Amazon’s Mechanical Turk let users divide simple tasks into any number of small subtasks that take only a few seconds to do, and which pay pennies — but dedicated piecemeal workers would perform thousands and thereby earn a modest but reliable wage. It was, as Jeff Bezos memorably put it back then, “artificial artificial intelligence.”</p>
<p>These were usually tasks that were then difficult to automate — like a CAPTCHA, or identifying the sentiment of a sentence, or a simple “draw a circle around the cat in this image,” things that people could do quickly and reliably. It was used liberally by people labeling relatively complex data and researchers aiming to get human evaluations or decisions at scale.</p>
<p>It’s named after the famous chess-playing “automaton” that actually used a human hiding in its base to make its plays — <a href="https://www.eapoe.org/works/essays/maelzel.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poe wrote a great contemporary takedown of it</a>. Sometimes automation is difficult or impossible, but in such cases you can make a sort of machine out of humanity. One has to be careful about it, but it has proven useful over the years.</p>
<p>But a study from researchers at EPFL in Switzerland shows that Mechanical Turk workers are automating their work using large language models like ChatGPT: A snake biting its own tail or perhaps swallowing itself entirely.</p>
<p>The question emerged when they considered using a service like MTurk as a “human in the loop” to improve or fact-check LLM responses, which are basically untrustable:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is tempting to rely on crowdsourcing to validate LLM outputs or to create human gold-standard data for comparison. But what if crowd workers themselves are using LLMs, e.g., in order to increase their productivity, and thus their income, on crowdsourcing platforms?</p></blockquote>
<p>To get a general sense of the problem, they assigned an “abstract summarization” task to be completed by turkers. By various analyses described <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07899" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the paper (still not published or peer-reviewed)</a> they “estimate that 33%-46% of crowd workers used LLMs when completing the task.”</p>
<p>To some, this will come as no surprise. Some level of automation has likely existed in turking ever since the platform started. Speed and reliability are incentivized, and if you could write a script that handled certain requests with 90% accuracy, you stood to make a fair amount of money. With so little oversight of individual contributors’ processes, it was inevitable that some of these tasks would not actually be performed by humans, as advertised. Integrity has never been Amazon’s strong suit so there was no sense relying on them.</p>
<p>But to see it laid out like this, and for a task that until recently seemed like one only a human could do — adequately summarize a paper’s abstract — it questions not just the value of Mechanical Turk but exposes another front in the imminent crisis of “AI training on AI-generated data” in yet another Ouroboros-esque predicament.</p>
<p>The researchers (Veniamin Veselovsky, Manoel Horta Ribeiro and Robert West) caution that this task is, as of the advent of modern LLMs, one particularly suited to surreptitious automation, and thus particularly likely to fall victim to these methods. But the state of the art is steadily advancing:</p>
<blockquote><p>LLMs are becoming more popular by the day, and multimodal models, supporting not only text, but also image and video input and output, are on the rise. With this, our results should be considered the ‘canary in the coal mine’ that should remind platforms, researchers, and crowd workers to find new ways to ensure that human data remain human.</p></blockquote>
<p>The threat of AI eating itself has been theorized for many years and became a reality almost instantly upon widespread deployment of LLMs: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/08/ai-is-eating-itself-bings-ai-quotes-covid-disinfo-sourced-from-chatgpt/">Bing’s pet ChatGPT quoted its own misinformation</a> as support for new misinformation about a COVID conspiracy.</p>
<p>If you can’t be 100% sure something was done by a human, you’re probably better off assuming it wasn’t. That’s a depressing principle to have to adhere to, but here we are.</p>

<p>Every person on the planet should have their own website, on their own domain name, and blog about whatever they want. </p>



<p>I’ve had my own website since I was 13. I will not tell you the domain name because it contained some cringe ass shit that’s still visible on archive.org. But that’s not the point, at least I was playing around, unrestricted. I registered a domain name with shared hosting.</p>



<p>Everyone should be writing in public. It may be about work, family, a lifelong obsession with a certain subject, random observations, photo albums, music you produced, your favorite quotes, etc. </p>



<p>It will be safely kept in archive.org for your ancestors to investigate and ponder on.</p>



<p>And they will. Even if most of your future offspring are normies, at some point, it’s nearly guaranteed that someone will discover your old blog and share it with the family.</p>



<p>“Hey, I have a crazy story. I found this website today. There used to be this person who did this and that. And he’s our grand-grand-grand-father!”</p>







<p>Now imagine if you had access to interesting details about your great-grandmother’s sister, or brother, or whatever. Wouldn’t you want to, at least for once, look into, and share the highlights with your family? </p>

      <h3>A&nbsp;$2500 e ink art&nbsp;piece that displays daily newspapers on your wall.</h3>
<p>I'm a&nbsp;news junkie, and the power and allure of a newspaper's front page have always fascinated me. So, when I stumbled upon <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/the-morning-paper-revisited-35b407822494">an article</a> written by a Google engineer who had built an e ink device with the front page of his favorite daily newspaper prominently displayed on his wall, I was jealous. So I built one as well, using off-the-shelf hardware. The project became a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25063726">small hit on Hackernews</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0665/5754/2714/files/Project_E-Ink-_Presskit-13_600x600.jpg?v=1675346217"></p>
<p>Since then my mailbox gets bombarded with people that want one as well. And now you can :). We're calling it: Project E Ink. A huge e ink screen, for on your wall, that allows you to&nbsp;read the front page of your favorite newspaper every day. It's beautiful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“As more and more connected devices arrive in our homes, it is a good time to remember the principles of <a href="https://calmtech.com/">Calm Technology</a>, first formulated at Xerox PARC in 1995. They talk about how technology should respect our attention and remain in the background most of the time, how relevant information should be presented calmly and make use of the periphery", <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/meet-accent-352cfa95813a">writes Max Braun</a>.</p>

<h2>E ink is the perfect technology for wall art</h2>
<p>E ink screens, with no backlight and a slow refresh rate, induce a sense of calm. In addition, due to their low power consumption, the batteries on e-ink screens can easily last for weeks or even months.</p>
<p>This is why e ink screens are uniquely suited for displaying wall art. The screen allows for the display of dynamic content, making it possible to display ever-changing front pages. The absence of a backlight makes it less distracting than an LCD screen.</p>
<h2>Finding the right hardware ✔</h2>
<p>In my search for vendors of e ink devices, I came across the Slovenian company <a href="https://www.visionect.com/">Visionect</a>, which sells e ink screens for corporate use. Known for their <a href="https://getjoan.com/">Joan</a> office screens that display the availability of a meeting room, they also sell <a href="https://www.visionect.com/product/place-and-play-32/">larger screens</a> for use in, for example, airports (to display flight times) and hotels (to provide conference room overviews).</p>
<p>It turns out that the dimensions of the screen they sell for corporate use are identical to those of an unfolded newspaper front page. The Place &amp; Play 32-inch screen is pricey (2300 euros ex VAT), but an exquisite piece of hardware. It is made of stainless steel with sharp edges and a glass panel on top. The USB ports are discretely concealed, and the device feels sturdy.</p>
<p>The device is equipped with Wi-Fi and a cloud-based content management system that allows you to load a webpage, for example <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/05/nytfrontpage/scan.pdf">the PDF of the New York Times frontpage</a>, making it easy to display. The CMS also allows you to configure the screen refresh rate (in my case, once daily was sufficient).</p>
<p>The screen has a convenient VESA mount on the back, making it super easy to hang on the wall with a standard TV mount and allowing it to blend seamlessly with existing décor.</p>
<meta charset="utf-8">
<h2>
<span>Satisfied news junkie&nbsp;</span>✔</h2>
<p>The device has no buttons or touchscreen; it only displays the front page of newspapers. That is sufficient to understand what is happening in the world. And if I also want to continue reading an article that piqued my interest, I use the dedicated news app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every morning, I wake up to a fresh newspaper edition on my wall. I find it wonderful to hover with a cup of coffee, scan the headlines, or peruse an article. Mission accomplished, and I am one satisfied news junkie.</p>

In this guide, we show you all the best practices, workflows, and tools to make Jupyter Notebooks play nicely with Git, GitHub, and Bitbucket.</p><h2>Git ↔ Jupyter Challenges</h2><p>Let's briefly list down the challenges of using Git with Jupyter Notebooks -</p><ul role="list"><li>Notebook Git diffs are hard to review</li><li>Resolving notebook merge conflict is painful</li><li>Large notebooks fail to render on GitHub</li><li>Notebook code reviews &amp;&nbsp;collaboration is tough</li></ul><p>In this article, we'll look at each of these problems &amp;&nbsp;suggest optimal solution for each.</p><h2>Using Git with Jupyter</h2><p>First, let's get the basics out of the way. There are 2 main ways to perform Git operations (<em>clone / pull / push</em>) for Jupyter Notebooks -</p><ol start="" role="list"><li><a href="https://blog.reviewnb.com/jupyterlab-git-extension/" target="_blank">Use JupyterLab Git extension</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.reviewnb.com/github-jupyter-notebook/" target="_blank">Use command line to run Git commands for Notebooks</a></li></ol><p>If you're new to Git, the above articles would give you step-by-step guide to version control notebooks on GitHub. If you're an experienced Git user, just note that the basic Git commands remain the same regardless of notebook's <sup>.ipynb</sup> file type.</p><h2>Git Diffs for Jupyter Notebooks</h2><p>We use Git diff to see the difference between two versions of the same file. This could be:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Local Notebook Diff:</strong> To review the changes you’ve made on your local machine before committing your work and sharing it with others.</li><li><strong>Commit &amp; PR Diff:</strong> To review the changes already pushed upstream in the context of a pull request or commit</li></ol><h3>1. Local Notebook Diff</h3><p>You can use the <sup>git diff</sup> command to view the difference between the current state of the file you are working on and the most recently checked-in version of the same file. You might use Git diffs to review the changes before committing or to compare different versions of notebook.</p><p>A general Git diff will show you textual diff for all changed files:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/648c38344833c0b5d9297b77_git_diff.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Terminal Git diff Output</figcaption></figure><p>Some issues with <sup>git diff</sup> output for Jupyter Notebooks:</p><ul role="list"><li>Notebooks are JSON under the hood, <sup>git diff</sup> shows raw JSON changes without any markdown or output rendering, code syntax highlighting etc.</li><li>Rich output (images, plots, widgets) raw diffs are impossible to review e.g. see the encoded <sup>image/png</sup> data in the above diff.</li><li>Notebook diffs have a lot of noise due to unintended metadata changes which you might not care about (e.g. <sup>execution_count</sup>).</li></ul><h3>Solution → nbdime</h3><p>You always want to review local notebook diffs <strong>before</strong> pushing the changes. But as we saw above, it's quite painful to review notebook diffs with plain <sup>git diff</sup> on command line.</p><p>One tool that solves this is <a href="https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">nbdime</a>. It's a dedicated diff &amp; merge library for Jupyter Notebooks. You can <a href="https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html" target="_blank">install nbdime</a> and review your local notebook changes in a rich rendered diff format as shown below -</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/648c4642afe9f6a54ef88a28_nbdime_gitdiff.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Notebook diff via nbdime</figcaption></figure><h3>Solution → JupyterLab Git Extension</h3><p>Another option is to use <a href="https://blog.reviewnb.com/jupyterlab-git-extension/" target="_blank">JupyterLab Git extension</a> to review local notebook diffs. This extension uses the nbdime library underneath. But the key advantage is the ability to review local notebook diffs directly in the JupyterLab UI with a click of a button.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/648c4d3a4c0f10df3fb58171_jupyterlab-git-commit.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Notebook diff via JupyterLab Git extension</figcaption></figure><h3>2. Commits &amp; PR Diff</h3><p>nbdime is great for reviewing local changes but once you push the changes to a remote repository, your colleagues might want to review your notebook changes &amp; provide feedback. </p><p>This is where <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2023-03-01-feature-preview-rich-jupyter-notebook-diffs/" target="_blank">rich notebook diffs on GitHub</a> are super helpful. Your teammates can simply go to GitHub &amp;&nbsp;open the commit or pull request page to review the notebook changes. While useful, the rich notebook diffs on GitHub has some limitations -</p><ul role="list"><li>One <a href="https://blog.reviewnb.com/how-to-add-comments-to-notebook-diffs-github/#problem" target="_blank">can't write comments</a> on rich notebook diffs. So your teammates can't give feedback on your notebook changes.</li><li>GitHub rich diffs <a href="https://blog.reviewnb.com/large-notebook-diff-not-rendering/" target="_blank">fail on large notebooks</a>, even if the actual differences you are reviewing are small. So if your notebooks are large, the GitHub diffs won’t be of much use.</li><li>GitHub <a href="https://blog.reviewnb.com/github-not-rendering-interactive-notebook-widgets/" target="_blank">doesn’t display interactive widgets or plots</a>. So if your notebook includes interactive visualizations from Plotly or Bokeh, or an ipywidget, it won’t render on GitHub.</li></ul><h3>Solution → ReviewNB</h3><p>We saw limitations of GitHub's notebook rich diff support above. One way to solve it is to use <a href="https://www.reviewnb.com/" target="_blank" data-gatrack="Article,Click,ReviewNB-Link">ReviewNB</a>. It's a dedicated app for Jupyter Notebooks code reviews. It helps you review notebook pull requests on GitHub &amp; Bitbucket. </p><p>You can see rich diffs and write comments on any notebook cell as shown below. Unlike GitHub, ReviewNB offers in-line commenting on rich diffs, works with large notebooks, and renders interactive plots &amp;&nbsp;widgets.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/61fcd6a09c061c32de8cbb25_new_visual_diff.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Notebook code reviews on ReviewNB</figcaption></figure><h2>Handling Notebook Merge Conflicts</h2><p>A common Git workflow is:</p><ul role="list"><li>Create a new branch, usually from <sup>main</sup>,</li><li>Work in the branch.</li><li>When your work is ready (usually after a pull request reviewed by your colleagues), merge the new branch back into the <sup>main</sup> branch</li></ul><p>Sometimes during this process, you may encounter a merge conflict. Merge conflicts usually happen when the branch you are trying to merge back into has changed, causing a conflict that Git needs your input to resolve.</p><p>For Jupyter notebooks, merge conflicts can be caused by code changes, but they can also be caused by notebook metadata. Metadata conflicts can be particularly difficult to visualize and fix. You might first notice a merge conflict on a pull request page:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/648c65be20fce185e4e3d2b5_merge_conflict.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Merge conflict on GitHub PR page</figcaption></figure><p>Or on the command line following a merge attempt:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/648c66a3d2a19d7345839d25_merge_conflict_terminal.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Merge conflict on terminal</figcaption></figure><p>If you start Jupyter and try to open a notebook in this state, you’ll get an error message saying that the notebook is unreadable. It's because the Git conflict markers make the notebook JSON invalid.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/648c66efddf071ba70832e6e_error_message.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h3>Solution → Text Editor</h3><p>Small notebook git merge conflicts can be resolved without any extra tooling, using either the GitHub UI or any text editor of your choice.</p><ul start="" role="list"><li>Use the git status command to check which files have merge conflicts. </li><li>Open the notebook in a text editor like Notepad, and you’ll see why Jupyter can’t read it: The notebook is no longer in standard JSON format because of the merge-conflict text.</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/648c6b1e47a6171c9438eac2_conflict_short.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Merge conflict on a text editor</figcaption></figure><ul start="" role="list"><li>To find the conflicts, search for the conflict markers &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, =======, &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.</li><li>Manually edit the JSON&nbsp;text to fix the conflict—you can choose the original version, the new version, or change the text to be some combination of both.</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/648c6dbc6fa313cc83cef490_text_editor_conflict_resolved.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Merge conflict resolved</figcaption></figure><ul role="list"><li>Remove the conflict markers when you have fixed the conflicting contents.</li><li>Mark the conflict as resolved by committing the notebook</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/648c6ce17cc69a36bfde3d5d_mark_conflict_resolution.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Mark conflict resolution</figcaption></figure><h3>Solution → nbdime / nbdev / JupyterLab Git Extension</h3><p>Small (1-2 line) conflicts can be resolved easily on a text editor but large conflicts are difficult. The biggest challenge is ensuring that the end state is a valid notebook JSON. Miss a comma or a double quote or a closing brace, and suddenly your notebook is not valid anymore.</p><p>If your merge conflict is more than a line or two, you would do better to use a tool like <a href="https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli.html#merging" target="_blank">nbdime</a>, <a href="https://nbdev1.fast.ai/merge.html" target="_blank">nbdev</a>, or the JupyterLab Git extension. Here's a step-by-step guide on resolving merge conflicts using the JupyterLab Git extension -</p><ul role="list"><li>When we try to merge conflicting git branches in the JupyterLab Git extension, merge fails midway &amp;&nbsp;the offending notebook appear in the “Conflicted” section of the left-hand Git panel (e.g. see <sup>NASA_Sea_level.ipynb</sup> in the screenshot below).</li><li>Double-click on the notebook to view the conflict. You will see the three versions: <sup>Current</sup>, <sup>Incoming</sup> &amp; the <sup>Common Ancestor</sup> -</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/648e93f7fa7bd074605539f8_jupyterlab-git-conflict-compare.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Merge conflict resolution in JupyterLab Git Extension</figcaption></figure><ul role="list"><li>Change the bottom cell to manually resolve the conflict. Either choose one of the three versions above or some combination thereof. </li><li>Click on “Mark as resolved”. You will see the notebook file move from the “Conflicted” section to the “Staged” section. It’s ready to commit. Use the bottom commit box to create &amp; push the commit, and you’re done!</li></ul><h2>Large Notebook Rendering on GitHub</h2><p>GitHub correctly renders small Jupyter Notebook files &amp; diffs. Unfortunately, GitHub fails to render large notebooks showing errors like <strong>“Unable to render rich display”</strong> or <strong>“The notebook took too long to render”</strong>.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/6491445bd9536cfdac20751c_too-big-to-render.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>GitHub fails to render large Notebooks &amp; Diffs</figcaption></figure><h3>Why notebook rendering fails on GitHub?</h3><p>There are 2 reasons for this -</p><ol start="" role="list"><li>GitHub rich diff functionality uses <a href="https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">nbdime</a> under the hood. And nbdime diffs can be very slow for large notebooks (as mentioned by others <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/nbdime/issues/358">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/nbdime/issues/540">here</a>).</li><li>For performance reasons, GitHub <a href="https://github.com/cabforum/servercert/issues/27#:~:text=GitHub%27s%20rich%20diff%20generator%20takes%20close%20to%205%20seconds%2C%20which%20is%20their%20internal%20timeout%20per%20discussions%20with%20GitHub%20Support" target="_blank">imposes a 5-second limitation</a> on rich diff rendering. So in cases where nbdime can’t render a diff in 5 seconds, GitHub won’t render it at all.</li></ol><p>This tells us why notebook diff rendering fails on GitHub. We assume similar reasons exist for the failure of rendering standalone notebooks. Bottom line is, at GitHub's scale, they don't want to wait tens of seconds for files to render on their platform. </p><h3>Solution → NBviewer</h3><p><a href="https://nbviewer.org/" target="_blank">NBviewer</a> is an online service provided by the Jupyter project that offers a free tool for rendering static Jupyter Notebooks from URLs. It allows you to explore the structure of a GitHub repository and select specific notebooks for viewing.</p><p>NBviewer requires your notebooks to be publicly accessible. If you're operating within a private GitHub repository, NBviewer cannot be used.</p><h3>Solution → Binder</h3><p><a href="https://mybinder.org/" target="_blank">Binder</a> is another Jupyter subproject that offers a free service enabling the sharing of executable notebooks on an online platform. To utilize Binder, simply provide the path to your repository, and it will generate a JupyterLab instance for you.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/64914cb78b5eab49d89d9668_binder.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Opening Jupyter Notebook on Binder</figcaption></figure><p>Binder is particularly advantageous when your notebook includes interactive elements like plots or widgets. GitHub's notebook viewer disables such interactivity for security reasons. Similar to nbviewer mentioned earlier, <a href="https://mybinder.org/" target="_blank">mybinder.org</a> is also limited to public repositories exclusively. If you wish to access notebooks from private repositories, you will need to <a href="https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/zero-to-binderhub/setup-binderhub.html" target="_blank">deploy your own BinderHub</a>.</p><h3>Solution → ReviewNB </h3><p><a href="https://www.reviewnb.com/" target="_blank" data-gatrack="Article,Click,ReviewNB-Link">ReviewNB</a> is a SaaS for Jupyter Notebook code reviews &amp;&nbsp;collaboration on GitHub &amp; Bitbucket. ReviewNB can render large notebook files that GitHub won't render natively. Below we see the ~30mb notebook that GitHub couldn’t render natively, rendering fine in ReviewNB —</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ba4ebe021cb91ae35dbf88c/64919b6cd366a419f0f4cebf_nbreview.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>ReviewNB can be used with both public and private repositories. ReviewNB also supports Google-Doc style <a href="https://blog.reviewnb.com/commenting-for-jupyter/">commenting &amp; discussion on Jupyter notebook cells</a>.</p><p>Lastly, ReviewNB also shows you rich diffs for commit &amp; PRs with the ability to write comments on the rich diff.

<p><span><span><span><strong>Today, <em>noyb </em>filed a complaint against TeleSign, a US company which profiled millions of phone users. TeleSign generates a “reputation score” and sells its services to various clients like TikTok, Microsoft or Salesforce. TeleSign secretly received the mobile phone data from BICS, a Belgian company that provides interconnection services for many mobile phone companies.</strong></span></span></span></p>

<ul><li><a href="https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2023-06/DRAT%20TELESIGN%20COMPLAINT%20FINAL%20-%20redacted.pdf"><span><span><span>Complaint filed by <em>noyb </em>before the Belgian DPA (in French)</span></span></span></a></li>
	<li><a href="https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2023-06/DRAT%20TELESIGN%20COMPLAINT%20FINAL%20-%20redacted-%20EN%20AUTOTRANSLATION.pdf">English autotranslation of complaint</a></li>
</ul><p><span><span><span><strong>BICS – the company connecting phone providers globally. </strong>BICS is a world leading communications service, that allows phone calls, roaming and data flows between different communications networks and services in different corners of the world. Instead of having direct agreements with each other, hundreds of mobile phone providers can connect their networks via BICS’ interconnection service. When processing phone customer data, BICS gets detailed information (e.g. the regularity of completed calls, call duration, long-term inactivity, range activity, or successful incoming traffic) about half of the worldwide mobile phone users.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>TeleSign generates “reputation scores” from BICS data. </strong>In March 2022, the <a href="https://www.lesoir.be/431389/article/2022-03-22/les-transferts-de-donnees-boiteux-de-proximus-sa-filiale-americaine-telesign">Belgian newspaper “Le Soir” first revealed</a> that the US company TeleSign was getting this data from BICS and was profiling millions of phone users across the globe. TeleSign gave every mobile phone user a “trust score” between 0 and 300 points. Based on this score, TeleSign’s clients (e.g. TikTok, Salesforce and Microsoft) could then decide to allow users to sign up to a platform or for example require an SMS verification first. TeleSign verifies over five billion unique phone numbers per month, representing half of the world’s mobile users.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Max Schrems: “<em>Your phone provider likely forwards data to BICS who then forwards it to TeleSign. TeleSign generates a ‘trust score’ about you and sells phone data to third parties like Microsoft, Salesforce or TikTok&nbsp; – without anyone being informed or giving consent.</em>”</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>User copy shows extent of TeleSign surveillance.</strong> Curious to know what was done with their data, several mobile users used their right under the GDPR to get a copy of their data from TeleSign, BICS and their national mobile provider. The answers were quite surprising: none of the mobile operator listed TeleSign as a recipient or knew that user data was sent to TeleSign. At the same time, TeleSign confirmed that it had the phone number and communicated the “trust score” assigned to their number, such as “medium-low”:</span></span></span></p>
            
      </div>

  
    

        
      

      
  


    <div>
          
                    <p><span><span><span><strong>AI to score people &amp; data transfers to the US.</strong> On its website TeleSign claims it is using artificial intelligence models to analyse the enormous amount of data received from BICS and to generate a “trust score” on each phone number<em>.</em> All of this happens in the United States, where US authorities also can access personal data from TeleSign.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>Processing unlawful, potentially huge fine. </strong>While there are some situations where personal data can be used for security purposes without consent, the secret use of telecommunication data on the majority of all global mobile phone users is not in line with EU and national data protection law. Besides being ordered to stop the transfer of data to TeleSign,<strong> </strong>the Belgian DPA can issue a fine up to € 236 million, which is 4 % of the global turnover of the Proximus group, the owner of BICS and TeleSign.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Max Schrems: “<em>The responses received by BICS and TeleSign suggest that this business model is not complying with EU privacy laws. We have therefore filed a complaint with the Belgian Data Protection Authority, who is competent for Proximus,&nbsp; BICS and TeleSign.</em>”</span></span></span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>We often hear that making small incremental improvements every day can lead to great things. This popular piece of advice rings true, and it’s a powerful reminder to keep pushing ourselves forward.</p>

<p>But there’s another side to this story that we don’t discuss as often: how incremental neglect and small missteps can accumulate and lead to negative outcomes. Recognizing and addressing these patterns of neglect early can make a significant difference in preventing larger problems down the road.</p>

<p>Reflecting on my own life, I’ve noticed that most of the things that really went off-track were indeed consequences of incremental neglect and numerous small yet poor choices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I didn’t become addicted to drugs overnight. It happened over hundreds of moments where I prioritized momentary pleasure over health and safety.</li>
  <li>I didn’t become overweight overnight. It happened over hundreds of moments where I opted for immediate gratification over long-term health.</li>
  <li>I didn’t ruin relationships overnight. It happened over hundreds of moments where I chose comfort over confronting difficult conversations, admitting my mistakes, or even just acknowledging that someone was better than me at something.</li>
</ul>

<p>From these experiences, I’ve realized that avoiding bad habits is just as important as cultivating good habits.</p>

<p>To address these kinds of issues, we must become aware of our patterns of incremental neglect and then take deliberate steps to counteract them and foster healthier habits.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">About <strong>OpenWorm</strong></h2>
<p dir="auto"><a href="http://openworm.org/" rel="nofollow">OpenWorm</a> aims to build the first comprehensive computational model of <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> (<em>C. elegans</em>), a microscopic roundworm. With only a thousand cells, it solves basic problems such as feeding, mate-finding and predator avoidance. Despite being extremely well-studied in biology, a deep, principled understanding of the biology of this organism remains elusive.</p>
<p dir="auto">We are using a bottom-up approach, aimed at observing the worm behaviour emerge from a simulation of data derived from scientific experiments carried out over the past decade. To do so, we are incorporating the data available from the scientific community into software models. We are also forging new collaborations with universities and research institutes to collect data that fill in the gaps.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Quickstart</h2>
<p dir="auto">We have put together a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/openworm/openworm" rel="nofollow">Docker container</a> that pulls together the major components of our simulation and runs it on your machine.  When you get it all running it does the following:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Run our nervous system model, known as <a href="https://github.com/openworm/c302">c302</a>, on your computer.</li>
<li>In parallel, run our 3D worm body model, known as <a href="https://github.com/openworm/sibernetic">Sibernetic</a>, on your computer, using the output of the nervous system model.</li>
<li>Produce graphs from the nervous system and body model that demonstrate its behavior on your computer for you to inspect.</li>
<li>Produce a movie showing the output of the body model.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Example Output</strong></p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>NOTE</strong>: Running the simulation for the full amount of time would produce content like the above.  However, in order to run in a reasonable amount of time, <strong>the default run time for the simulation is limited</strong>.  As such, you will see only a partial output, equivalent to about 5% of run time, compared to the examples above.  To extend the run time, use the <code>-d</code> argument as described below.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Installation</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Pre-requisites:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>You should have at least 60 GB of free space on your machine and at least 2GB of RAM</li>
<li>You should be able to clone git repositories on your machine. <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git" rel="nofollow">Install git</a>, or <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">this GUI</a> may be useful.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">To Install:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Install <a href="http://docker.com/" rel="nofollow">Docker</a> on your system.</li>
<li>If your system does not have enough free space, you can use
an external hard disk.  On MacOS X, the location for image storage
can be specified in the <a href="https://forums.docker.com/t/change-docker-image-directory-for-mac/18891/15" rel="nofollow">Advanced Tab</a> in Preferences.  See <a href="https://forums.docker.com/t/how-do-i-change-the-docker-image-installation-directory/1169/18" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>
in addition for Linux instructions.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Running</strong></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Ensure the Docker daemon is running in the background (on MacOS/Windows there should be an icon with the Docker whale logo showing in the menu bar/system tray).</li>
<li>Open a terminal and run: <code>git clone http://github.com/openworm/openworm</code>; <code>cd openworm</code></li>
<li>Optional: Run <code>./build.sh</code> (or <code>build.cmd</code> on Windows). If you skip this step, it will download the latest released Docker image from the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/openworm/openworm" rel="nofollow">OpenWorm Docker hub</a>.</li>
<li>Run <code>./run.sh</code> (or <code>run.cmd</code> on Windows).</li>
<li>About 5-10 minutes of output will display on the screen as the steps run.</li>
<li>The simulation will end.  Run <code>stop.sh</code> (<code>stop.cmd</code> on Windows) on your system to clean up the running container.</li>
<li>Inspect the output in the <code>output</code> directory on your local machine.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Advanced</strong></p>
<p dir="auto"><em><strong>Arguments</strong></em></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>-d [num] : Use to modify the duration of the simulation in milliseconds.  Default is 15.  Use 5000 to run for time to make the full movie above (i.e. 5 seconds).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><em><strong>Other things to try</strong></em></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Open a terminal and run <code>./run-shell-only.sh</code> (or <code>run-shell-only.cmd</code> on Windows).  This will let you log into the container before it has run <code>master_openworm.py</code>.  From here you can inspect the internals of the various checked out code bases and installed systems and modify things. Afterwards you'll still need to run <code>./stop.sh</code> to clean up.</li>
<li>If you wish to modify what gets installed, you should modify <code>Dockerfile</code>.  If you want to modify what runs, you should modify <code>master_openworm.py</code>.  Either way you will need to run <code>build.sh</code> in order to rebuild the image locally.  Afterwards you can run normally.</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">FAQ</h3>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><strong>What is the Docker container?</strong></h4>
<p dir="auto">The Docker container is a self-contained environment in which you can run OpenWorm simulations.  It's fully set up to get you started by following the steps above. At the moment,
it runs simulations and produces visualizations for you, but these visualizations must be viewed outside of the Docker container. While you do not need to know
much about Docker to use OpenWorm, if you are planning on working extensively with the platform, you may benefit
from understanding some basics. <a href="https://docker-curriculum.com/" rel="nofollow">Docker Curriculum</a>
is an excellent tutorial for beginners that is straightforward to work through (Sections 1 - 2.5 are plenty sufficient).</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><strong>Is it possible to modify the simulation without having to run <code>build.sh</code>?</strong></h4>
<p dir="auto">Yes, but it is marginally more complex.  The easiest way is to modify anything in the Docker container once you are inside of it - it will work just like a bash shell.  If you want to modify any code in the container, you'll need to use an editor that runs in the terminal, like nano.  Once you've modified something in the container, you don't need to re-build.  However, if you run <code>stop.sh</code> once you exit, those changes will be gone.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><strong>How do I access more data than what is already output?</strong></h4>
<p dir="auto">The simulation by default outputs only a few figures and movies to your home system (that is, outside of the Docker container).  If you want to access the entire output of the simulation, you will need to copy it from the Docker container.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, say you want to extract the worm motion data.  This is contained in the file <code>worm_motion_log.txt</code>, which is found in the <code>/home/ow/sibernetic/simulations/[SPECIFIC_TIMESTAMPED_DIRECTORY]/worm_motion_log.txt</code>.  The directory <code>[SPECIFIC_TIMESTAMPED_DIRECTORY]</code> will have a name like <code>C2_FW_2018_02-12_18-36-32</code>, and its name can be found by checking the <code>output</code> directory.  This is actually the main output directory for the simulation, and contains all output, including cell modelling and worm movement.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once the simulation ends and you exit the container with <code>exit</code>, but before you run <code>stop.sh</code>, run the following command from the openworm-docker-master folder:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>docker cp openworm:/home/ow/sibernetic/simulations/[SPECIFIC_TIMESTAMPED_DIRECTORY]/worm_motion_log.txt ./worm_motion_log.txt</code></p>
<p dir="auto">This will copy the file from the Docker container, whose default name is <code>openworm</code>.  <strong>It is crucial that you do not run <code>stop.sh</code> before trying to get your data out (see below)</strong></p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><strong>What is the difference between <code>exit</code> and <code>stop.sh</code>?</strong></h4>
<p dir="auto">When you are in the Docker Container <code>openworm</code>, and are done interacting with it, you type <code>exit</code> to return to your system's shell.  This stops execution of anything in the container, and that container's status is now <code>Exited</code>.  If you try to re-start the process using <code>run-shell-only.sh</code>, you will get an error saying that the container already exists.  You can choose, at this point, to run <code>stop.sh</code>.  Doing so will remove the container and any files associated with it, allowing you to run a new simulation.  However, if you don't want to remove that container, you will instead want to re-enter it.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><strong>How do I enter a container I just exited?</strong></h4>
<p dir="auto">If you run <code>stop.sh</code> you'll delete your data and reset the container for a new run.  If, however, you don't want to do that, you can re-enter the Docker container like this:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="docker start openworm                 # Restarts the container
docker exec -it openworm /bin/bash    # Runs bash inside the container"><pre><code>docker start openworm                 # Restarts the container
docker exec -it openworm /bin/bash    # Runs bash inside the container
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This tells Docker to start the container, to <em>execute</em> commands (<code>exec</code>) with an <em>interactive, tty</em> (<code>-it</code>)  bash (<code>bash</code>) shell in the container <code>openworm</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">You'll be able to interact with the container as before.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Documentation</h2>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Analytics">https://docs.brew.sh/Analytics</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36628013">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="wrap">
  

<p>Homebrew gathers anonymous analytics using InfluxDB. You will be notified the first time you run <code>brew update</code> or install Homebrew. Analytics are not enabled until after this notice is shown, to ensure that you can <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Analytics#opting-out">opt out</a> without ever sending analytics data.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>Homebrew is provided free of charge and run entirely by volunteers in their spare time. As a result, we do not have the resources to do detailed user studies of Homebrew users to decide on how best to design future features and prioritise current work. Anonymous analytics allow us to prioritise fixes and features based on how, where and when people use Homebrew. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If a formula is widely used and is failing often it will enable us to prioritise fixing that formula over others.</li>
  <li>Collecting the OS version allows us to decide which versions of macOS to prioritise for support and identify build failures that occur only on single versions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-long">How Long?</h2>

<p>Homebrew’s anonymous analytics has a 365 day retention period in InfluxDB.</p>

<h2 id="what">What?</h2>

<p>Homebrew’s analytics record some shared information for every event:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Whether the data is being sent from CI, e.g. <code>true</code> if the CI environment variable is set.</li>
  <li>Whether you are using the default install prefix (e.g. <code>/opt/homebrew</code>) or a custom one (e.g. <code>/home/mike/.brew</code>). If your prefix is custom, it will be sent as <code>custom-prefix</code> to preserve anonymity.</li>
  <li>Whether you are a Homebrew Developer, e.g. <code>true</code> if the <code>HOMEBREW_DEVELOPER</code> environment variable is set.</li>
  <li>Whether <code>devcmdrun</code> is set, e.g. <code>true</code> if you have ever run one of Homebrew’s developer commands.</li>
  <li>Your CPU’s architecture, e.g. <code>x86_64</code>.</li>
  <li>The OS you are using and its version number, e.g. <code>macOS 13</code>.</li>
  <li>The version of Homebrew, e.g. <code>4.0.0</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>All analytics data previously sent to Google Analytics has been destroyed.</p>

<p>Homebrew’s analytics records the following different events:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>install</code> event category and the Homebrew formula from a non-private GitHub tap you install plus any used options (e.g. <code>wget --HEAD</code>) as the action. This allows us to identify which formulae where work should be prioritised, as well as how to handle possible deprecation or removal of any.</li>
  <li>The <code>install_on_request</code> event category and the Homebrew formula from a non-private GitHub tap you have requested to install (e.g. when explicitly named with a <code>brew install</code>) plus options. This allows us to differentiate the formulae that users intend to install from those pulled in as dependencies.</li>
  <li>The <code>cask_install</code> event category and the Homebrew cask from a non-private GitHub tap you install as the action. This allows us to identify which casks where work should be prioritised, as well as how to handle possible deprecation or removal of any.</li>
  <li>The <code>build_error</code> event category and the Homebrew formula plus options that failed to install as the action, e.g. <code>wget --HEAD</code>. This allows us to identify formulae that may need fixing. The details or logs of the build error are not sent.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also view all the information that is sent by Homebrew’s analytics by setting <code>HOMEBREW_ANALYTICS_DEBUG=1</code> in your environment. Please note this will also stop any analytics from being sent.</p>

<p>It is impossible for the Homebrew developers to match any particular event to any particular user. We do not store or receive IP addresses.</p>

<h2 id="whenwhere">When/Where?</h2>

<p>Homebrew’s analytics are sent throughout Homebrew’s execution to InfluxDB over HTTPS.</p>

<h2 id="who">Who?</h2>

<p>Aggregates of analytics events are <a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/analytics/">publicly available</a>. A JSON API is also available. The majority of Homebrew maintainers are not granted more detailed analytics data beyond these public resources.</p>

<h2 id="how">How?</h2>

<p>The code is viewable in <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/HEAD/Library/Homebrew/utils/analytics.rb"><code>analytics.rb</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/HEAD/Library/Homebrew/utils/analytics.sh"><code>analytics.sh</code></a>. They are done in a separate background process and fail fast to avoid delaying any execution. They will fail immediately and silently if you have no network connection.</p>

<h2 id="opting-out">Opting out</h2>

<p>Homebrew analytics helps us maintainers and leaving it on is appreciated. However, if you want to opt out of Homebrew’s analytics, you can set this variable in your environment:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>export </span><span>HOMEBREW_NO_ANALYTICS</span><span>=</span>1
</code></pre></div>

<p>Alternatively, this will prevent analytics from ever being sent:</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Description</h2>
<p dir="auto">This is a collection of personal blogs from the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36575081" rel="nofollow">Ask HN: Could you share your personal blog here?</a>
thread on Hacker News, prepared as OPML for easy import into your favorite RSS reader.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2>
<p dir="auto">Download <a href="https://github.com/outcoldman/hackernews-personal-blogs/blob/master/list.opml">list.opml</a> and import it into your favorite RSS reader.</p>
<p dir="auto">When building this list, I have ignored any user with less or equal to 100 karma, which means I might have missed some
interesting blogs, but at the same time I wanted to ignore spam or throwaway accounts.</p>
<p dir="auto">The list is sorted by the user karma on Hacker News, so the first blogs are from users with the highest karma.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can modify the list in your editor to include only the top 10 or 100 blogs, or to remove some blogs you are not interested in.</p>
<p dir="auto">Not from all comments I was able to extract a blog URL, so the list is not complete. I just parse the correct recocognized URLs
from comments.</p>
<p dir="auto">Not all blogs have RSS feeds, or the RSS feeds aren't included in the <code>&lt;link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" href="..."&gt;</code>
or <code>&lt;link rel="alternate" type="application/atom+xml" href="..."&gt;</code> tag, so I might have missed some blogs.</p>
<p dir="auto">Anyway, we got more than 600 blogs, so I think it is a good start.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can find the output of the latest run at <a href="https://github.com/outcoldman/hackernews-personal-blogs/blob/master/console.log">console.log</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Regenerate list</h2>
<p dir="auto">As easy as running:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="go run ./main.go | tee > console.log"><pre>go run ./main.go <span>|</span> tee <span>&gt;</span> console.log</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">It is going to take a while, as it needs to fetch the karma for each user, and then fetch the RSS feed for each blog.</p>

 Understand</p><p>a novelette </p><p>by Ted Chiang  </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Ted Chiang writes... </p><p>The initial impulse to write "Understand" arose from an offhand remark made by my roommate in college; he was reading Sartre's Nausea at the time, whose protagonist finds only meaninglessness in everything he sees. But what would it be like, my roommate wondered, to find meaning and order in everything you saw? </p><p>To me that suggested a kind of heightened perception, which in turn suggested superintelligence. I also thought about how the differences between human cognition and animal cognition are greater than any test can measure, and I began to wonder what might characterize superhuman cognition.</p><p>I submitted "Understand" to various magazines but received only form-letter rejection slips, so I put it away. Later, while attending the Clarion writing workshop, I showed it to Spider Robinson, who was convinced I should send it out again. I eventually incorporated the suggestions he made, along with those of Kate Wilhelm and Damon Knight, and was able to sell the story. It won the Asimov's Reader's Choice Award for Best Novelette in 1991, and was a finalist for the Hugo. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>A layer of ice; it feels rough against my face, but not cold. I've got nothing to hold on to; my gloves just keep sliding off it. I can see people on top, running around, but they can't do anything. I'm trying to pound the ice with my fists, but my arms move in slow motion, and my lungs must have burst, and my head's going fuzzy, and I feel like I'm dissolving-- </p><p>I wake up, screaming. My heart's going like a jackhammer. Christ. I pull off my blankets and sit on the edge of the bed. </p><p>I couldn't remember that before. Before I only remembered falling through the ice; the doctor said my mind had suppressed the rest. Now I remember it, and it's the worst nightmare I've ever had. </p><p>I'm grabbing the down comforter with my fists, and I can feel myself trembling. I try to calm down, to breathe slowly, but sobs keep forcing their way out. It was so real I could feel it: feel what it was like to die. </p><p>I was in that water for nearly an hour; I was more vegetable than anything else by the time they brought me up. Am I recovered? It was the first time the hospital had ever tried their new drug on someone with so much brain damage. Did it work? </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>The same nightmare, again and again. After the third time, I know I'm not going to sleep again. I spend the remaining hours before dawn worrying. Is this the result? Am I losing my mind? </p><p>Tomorrow is my weekly checkup with the resident at the hospital. I hope he'll have some answers. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I drive into downtown Boston, and after half an hour Dr. Hooper can see me. I sit on a gurney in an examining room, behind a yellow curtain. Jutting out of the wall at waist-height is a horizontal flatscreen, adjusted for tunnel vision so it appears blank from my angle. The doctor types at the keyboard, presumably calling up my file, and then starts examining me. As he's checking my pupils with a penlight, I tell him about my nightmares. </p><p>"Did you ever have any before the accident, Leon?" He gets out his little mallet and taps at my elbows, knees, and ankles. </p><p>"Never. Are these a side effect of the drug?" </p><p>"Not a side effect. The hormone K therapy regenerated a lot of damaged neurons, and that's an enormous change that your brain has to adjust to. The nightmares are probably just a sign of that." </p><p>"Is this permanent?" </p><p>"It's unlikely," he says. "Once your brain gets used to having all those pathways again, you'll be fine. Now touch your index finger to the tip of your nose, and then bring it to my finger here." </p><p>I do what he tells me. Next he has me tap each finger to my thumb, quickly. Then I have to walk a straight line, as if I'm taking a sobriety test. After that, he starts quizzing me. </p><p>"Name the parts of an ordinary shoe." </p><p>"There's the sole, the heel, the laces. Um, the holes that the laces go through are eyes, and then there's the tongue, underneath the laces..." </p><p>"Okay. Repeat this number: three nine one seven four--" </p><p>"--six two."</p><p>Dr. Hooper wasn't expecting that. "What?" </p><p>"Three nine one seven four six two. You used that number the first time you examined me, when I was still an inpatient. I guess it's a number you test patients with a lot." </p><p>"You weren't supposed to memorize it; it's meant to be a test of immediate recall." </p><p>"I didn't intentionally memorize it. I just happened to remember it." </p><p>"Do you remember the number from the second time I examined you?" </p><p>I pause for a moment. "Four zero eight one five nine two." </p><p>He's surprised. "Most people can't retain so many digits if they've only heard them once. Do you use mnemonic tricks?" </p><p>I shake my head. "No. I always keep phone numbers in the autodialer." </p><p>He goes to the terminal and taps at the numeric keypad. "Try this one." He reads a fourteen-digit number, and I repeat it back to him. "You think you can do it backwards?" I recite the digits in reverse order. He frowns, and starts typing something into my file. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I'm sitting in front of a terminal in one of the testing rooms in the psychiatric ward; it's the nearest place Dr. Hooper could get some intelligence tests. There's a small mirror set in one wall, probably with a video camera behind it. In case it's recording, I smile at it and wave briefly. I always do that to the hidden cameras in automatic cash machines. </p><p>Dr. Hooper comes in with a printout of my test results. "Well, Leon, you did... very well. On both tests you scored in the ninety-ninth percentile." </p><p>My jaw drops. "You're kidding." </p><p>"No, I'm not." He has trouble believing it himself. "Now that number doesn't indicate how many questions you got right; it means that relative to the general population --" </p><p>"I know what it means," I say absently. "I was in the seventieth percentile when they tested us in high school." Ninety-ninth percentile. Inwardly, I'm trying to find some sign of this. What should it feel like? </p><p>He sits down on the table, still looking at the printout. "You never attended college, did you?" </p><p>I return my attention to him. "I did, but I left before graduating. My ideas of education didn't mesh with the professors'." </p><p>"I see." He probably takes this to mean I flunked out. "Well, clearly you've improved tremendously. A little of that may have come about naturally as you grew older, but most of it must be a result of the hormone K therapy." </p><p>"This is one hell of a side-effect." </p><p>"Well, don't get too excited. Test scores don't predict how well you can do things in the real world." I roll my eyes upward when Dr. Hooper isn't looking. Something amazing is going on, and all he can offer is a truism. "I'd like to follow up on this with some more tests. Can you come in tomorrow?" </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I'm in the middle of retouching a holograph when the phone rings. I waver between the phone and the console, and reluctantly opt for the phone. I'd normally have the answering machine take any calls when I'm editing, but I need to let people know I'm working again. I lost a lot of business when I was in the hospital: one of the risks of being a freelancer. I touch the phone and say, "Greco Holographics, Leon Greco speaking." </p><p>"Hey Leon, it's Jerry." </p><p>"Hi Jerry. What's up?" I'm still studying the image on the screen: it's a pair of helical gears, intermeshed. A trite metaphor for cooperative action, but that's what the customer wanted for his ad. </p><p>"You interested in seeing a movie tonight? Me and Sue and Tori were going to see Metal Eyes."</p><p>"Tonight? Oh, I can't. Tonight's the last performance of the one-woman show at the Hanning Playhouse." The surfaces of the gear teeth are scratched and oily-looking. I highlight each surface using the cursor, and type in the parameters to be adjusted. </p><p>"What's that?" </p><p>"It's called Symplectic. It's a monologue in verse." Now I adjust the lighting, to remove some of the shadows from where the teeth mesh. "Want to come along?" </p><p>"Is this some kind of Shakespearean soliloquy?" </p><p>Too much: with that lighting, the outer edges will be too bright. I specify an upper limit for the reflected light's intensity. "No, it's a stream-of-consciousness piece, and it alternates between four different meters; iambic's only one of them. All the critics called it a tour de force."</p><p>"I didn't know you were such a fan of poetry." </p><p>After checking all the numbers once more, I let the computer recalculate the interference pattern. "Normally, I'm not, but this one seemed really interesting. How's it sound to you?" </p><p>"Thanks, but I think we'll stick with the movie." </p><p>"Okay, you guys have fun. Maybe we can get together next week." We say goodbye and hang up, and I wait for the recalc to finish. </p><p>Suddenly it occurs to me what's just happened. I've never been able to do any editing while talking on the phone. But this time I had no trouble keeping my mind on both things at once. </p><p>Will the surprises never end? Once the nightmares were gone and I could relax, the first thing I noticed was the increase in my reading speed and comprehension. I was actually able to read the books on my shelves that I'd always meant to get around to, but never had the time; even the more difficult, technical material. Back in college, I'd accepted the fact that I couldn't study everything that interested me. It's exhilarating to discover that maybe I can; I was positively gleeful when I bought an armload of books the other day. </p><p>And now I find I can concentrate on two things at once; something I never would have predicted. I stand up at my desk and shout out loud, as if my favorite baseball team had just surprised me with a triple play. That's what it feels like. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>The Neurologist-in-Chief, Dr. Shea, has taken over my case, presumably because he wants to take the credit. I scarcely know him, but he acts as if I've been his patient for years. </p><p>He's asked me into his office to have a talk. He interlaces his fingers and rests his elbows on his desk. "How do you feel about the increase in your intelligence?" he asks. </p><p>What an inane question. "I'm very pleased about it." </p><p>"Good," says Dr. Shea. "So far, we've found no adverse effects of the hormone K therapy. You don't require any further treatment for the brain damage from your accident." I nod. "However, we're conducting a study to learn more about the hormone's effect on intelligence. If you're willing, we'd like to give you a further injection of the hormone, and then monitor the results." </p><p>Suddenly he's got my attention; finally, something worth listening to. "I'd be willing to do that." </p><p>"You understand that this is purely for investigational purposes, not therapeutic. You may benefit from it with further gains in your intelligence, but this is not medically necessary for your health." </p><p>"I understand. I suppose I have to sign a consent form." </p><p>"Yes. We can also offer you some compensation for participating in this study." He names a figure, but I'm barely listening. </p><p>"That'll be fine." I'm imagining where this might lead, what it might mean for me, and a thrill runs through me. </p><p>"We'd also like you to sign a confidentiality agreement. Clearly this drug is enormously exciting, but we don't want any announcements to be made prematurely." </p><p>"Certainly, Dr. Shea. Has anyone been given additional injections before?" </p><p>"Of course; you're not going to be a guinea pig. I can assure you, there haven't been any harmful side effects." </p><p>"What sort of effects did they experience?" </p><p>"It's better if we don't plant suggestions in your mind: you might imagine you were experiencing the symptoms I mention." </p><p>Shea's very comfortable with the doctor-knows-best routine. I keep pushing. "Can you at least tell me how much their intelligence increased?" </p><p>"Every individual is different. You shouldn't base your expectations on what's happened to others." </p><p>I conceal my frustration. "Very well, doctor." </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>If Shea doesn't want to tell me about hormone K, I can find out about it on my own. From my terminal at home I log onto the datanet. I access the FDA's public database, and start perusing their current IND's, the Investigational New Drug applications that must be approved before human trials can begin. </p><p>The application for hormone K was submitted by Sorensen Pharmaceutical, a company researching synthetic hormones that encourage neuron regeneration in the central nervous system. I skim the results of the drug tests on oxygen-deprived dogs, and then baboons: all the animals recovered completely. Toxicity was low, and long term observation didn't reveal any adverse effects. </p><p>The results of cortical samples are provocative. The brain-damaged animals grew replacement neurons with many more dendrites, but the healthy recipients of the drug remained unchanged. The conclusion of the researchers: hormone K replaces only damaged neurons, not healthy ones. In the brain-damaged animals, the new dendrites seemed harmless: PET scans didn't reveal any change in brain metabolism, and the animals' performance on intelligence tests didn't change. </p><p>In their application for human clinical trials, the Sorensen researchers outlined protocols for testing the drug first on healthy subjects, and then on several types of patients: stroke victims, sufferers of Alzheimer's, and persons -- like me -- in a persistent vegetative state. I can't access the progress reports for those trials: even with patient anonymity, only participating doctors have clearance to examine those records. </p><p>The animal studies don't shed any light on the increased intelligence in humans. It's reasonable to assume that the effect on intelligence is proportional to the number of neurons replaced by the hormone, which in turn depends on the amount of initial damage. That means that the deep coma patients would undergo the greatest improvements. Of course, I'd need to see the progress of the other patients to confirm this theory; that'll have to wait. </p><p>The next question: is there a plateau, or will additional dosages of the hormone cause further increases? I'll know the answer to that sooner than the doctors. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I'm not nervous; in fact, I feel quite relaxed. I'm just lying on my stomach, breathing very slowly. My back is numb; they gave me a local anaesthetic, and then injected the hormone K intraspinally. An intravenous wouldn't work, since the hormone can't get past the blood-brain barrier. This is the first such injection I can recall having, though I'm told that I've received two before: the first while still in the coma, the second when I had regained consciousness but no cognitive ability. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>More nightmares. They're not all actually violent, but they're the most bizarre, mind-blowing dreams I've ever had, often with nothing in them that I recognize. I often wake up screaming, flailing around in bed. But this time, I know they'll pass. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>There are several psychologists at the hospital studying me now. It's interesting to see how they analyze my intelligence. One doctor perceives my skills in terms of components, such as acquisition, retention, performance, and transfer. Another looks at me from the angles of mathematical and logical reasoning, linguistic communication, and spatial visualization. </p><p>I'm reminded of my college days when I watch these specialists, each with a pet theory, each contorting the evidence to fit. I'm even less convinced by them now than I was back then; they still have nothing to teach me. None of their categorizations are fruitful in analyzing my performance, since -- there's no point in denying it -- I'm equally good at everything. </p><p>I could be studying a new class of equation, or the grammar of a foreign language, or the operation of an engine; in each case, everything fits together, all the elements cooperate beautifully. In each case, I don't have to consciously memorize rules, and then apply them mechanically. I just perceive how the system behaves as a whole, as an entity. Of course, I'm aware of all the details and individual steps, but they require so little concentration that they almost feel intuitive. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Penetrating computer security is really quite dull; I can see how it might attract those who can't resist a challenge to their cleverness, but it's not intellectually aesthetic at all. It's no different than tugging on the doors of a locked house until you find an improperly installed lock. A useful activity, but hardly interesting.</p><p>Getting into the FDA's private database was easy. I played with one of the hospital wall terminals, running the visitor information program, which displays maps and a staff directory. I broke out of the program to the system level, and wrote a decoy program to mimic the opening screen for logging on. Then I simply left the terminal alone; eventually one of my doctors came by to check one of her files. The decoy rejected her password, and then restored the true opening screen. The doctor tried logging in again, and was successful this time, but her password was left with my decoy. </p><p>Using the doctor's account, I had clearance to view the FDA patient record database. In the Phase I trials, on healthy volunteers, the hormone had no effect. The ongoing Phase II clinical trials are a different matter. Here are weekly reports on eighty-two patients, each identified by a number, all treated with hormone K, most of them victims of a stroke or Alzheimer's, some of them coma cases. The latest reports confirm my prediction: those with greater brain damage display greater increases in intelligence. PET scans reveal heightened brain metabolism. </p><p>Why didn't the animal studies provide a precedent for this? I think the concept of critical mass provides an analogy. Animals fall below some critical mass in terms of synapses; their brains support only minimal abstraction, and gain nothing from additional synapses. Humans exceed that critical mass. Their brains support full self-awareness, and -- as these records indicate -- they use any new synapses to the fullest possible extent. </p><p>The most exciting records are those of the newly begun investigational studies, using a few of the patients who volunteered. Additional injections of the hormone do increase intelligence further, but again it depends on the degree of initial damage. The patients with minor strokes haven't even reached genius levels. Those with greater damage have gone further. </p><p>Of the patients originally in deep coma states, I'm the only one thus far who's received a third injection. I gained more new synapses than anyone previously studied; it's an open question as to how high my intelligence will go. I can feel my heart pounding when I think about it. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Playing with the doctors is becoming more and more tedious as the weeks go by. They treat me as if I were simply an idiot savant: a patient who exhibits certain signs of high intelligence, but still just a patient. As far as the neurologists are concerned, I'm just a source of PET scan images and an occasional vial of cerebrospinal fluid. The psychologists have the opportunity to gain some insight into my thinking through their interviews, but they can't shed their preconception of me as someone out of his depth, an ordinary man awarded gifts that he can't appreciate. </p><p>On the contrary, the doctors are the ones who don't appreciate what's happening. They're certain that real-world performance can't be enhanced by a drug, and that my ability exists only according to the artificial yardstick of intelligence tests, so they waste their time with those. But the yardstick is not only contrived, it's too short: my consistent perfect scores don't tell them anything, because they have no basis for comparison this far out on the bell curve. </p><p>Of course, the test scores merely capture a shadow of the real changes occurring. If only the doctors could feel what's going on in my head: how much I'm recognizing that I missed before, how many uses I can see for that information. Far from being a laboratory phenomenon, my intelligence is practical and effectual. With my near total recall and my ability to correlate, I can assess a situation immediately, and choose the best course of action for my purposes; I'm never indecisive. Only theoretical topics pose a challenge. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>No matter what I study, I can see patterns. I see the gestalt, the melody within the notes, in everything: mathematics and science, art and music, psychology and sociology. As I read the texts, I can think only that the authors are plodding along from one point to the next, groping for connections that they can't see. They're like a crowd of people unable to read music, peering at the score for a Bach sonata, trying to explain how one note leads to another. </p><p>As glorious as these patterns are, they also whet my appetite for more. There are other patterns waiting to be discovered, gestalts of another scale entirely. With respect to those, I'm blind myself; all my sonatas are just isolated data points by comparison. I have no idea what form such gestalts might assume, but that'll come in time. I want to find them, and comprehend them. I want this more than anything I've ever wanted before. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>The visiting doctor's name is Clausen, and he doesn't behave like the other doctors. Judging by his manner, he's accustomed to wearing a mask of blandness with his patients, but he's a bit uncomfortable today. He affects an air of friendliness, but it isn't as fluent as the perfunctory noise that the other doctors make. </p><p>"The test works this way, Leon: you'll read some descriptions of various situations, each presenting a problem. After each one, I want you to tell me what you'd do to solve that problem." </p><p>I nod. "I've had this kind of test before." </p><p>"Fine, fine." He types a command, and the screen in front of me fills with text. I read the scenario: it's a problem in scheduling and prioritizing. It's realistic, which is unusual; scoring such a test is too arbitrary for most researchers' tastes. I wait before giving my answer, though Clausen is still surprised at my speed. </p><p>"That's very good, Leon." He hits a key on his computer. "Try this one." </p><p>We continue with more scenarios. As I'm reading the fourth one, Clausen is careful to display only professional detachment. My response to this problem is of special interest to him, but he doesn't want me to know. The scenario involves office politics and fierce competition for a promotion. </p><p>I realize who Clausen is: he's a government psychologist, perhaps military, probably part of the CIA's Office of Research and Development. This test is meant to gauge hormone K's potential for producing strategists. That's why he's uncomfortable with me: he's used to dealing with soldiers and government employees, subjects whose job is to follow orders. </p><p>It's likely that the CIA will wish to retain me as a subject for more tests; they may do the same with other patients, depending on their performance. After that, they'll get some volunteers from their ranks, starve their brains of oxygen, and treat them with hormone K. I certainly don't wish to become a CIA resource, but I've already demonstrated enough ability to arouse their interest. The best I can do is to downplay my skills and get this question wrong. </p><p>I offer a poor course of action as my answer, and Clausen is disappointed. Nonetheless, we press on. I take longer on the scenarios now, and give weaker responses. Sprinkled among the harmless questions are the critical ones: one about avoiding a hostile corporate takeover, another about mobilizing people to prevent the construction of a coal burning plant. I miss each of these questions. </p><p>Clausen dismisses me when the test ends; he's already trying to formulate his recommendations. If I'd shown my true abilities, the CIA would recruit me immediately. My uneven performance will reduce their eagerness, but it won't change their minds; the potential returns are too great for them to ignore hormone K. </p><p>My situation has changed profoundly; when the CIA decides to retain me as a test subject, my consent will be purely optional. I must make plans. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>It's four days later, and Shea is surprised. "You want to withdraw from the study?" </p><p>"Yes, effective immediately. I'm returning to work." </p><p>"If it's a matter of compensation, I'm sure we can--" </p><p>"No, money's not the problem. I've simply had enough of these tests." </p><p>"I know the tests become tiring after a while, but we're learning a great deal. And we appreciate your participation, Leon. It's not merely --" </p><p>"I know how much you're learning from these tests. It doesn't change my decision: I don't wish to continue." </p><p>Shea starts to speak again, but I cut him off. "I know that I'm still bound by the confidentiality agreement; if you'd like me to sign something confirming that, send it to me." I get up and head for the door. "Goodbye, Dr. Shea." </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>It's two days later when Shea calls. </p><p>"Leon, you have to come in for an examination. I've just been informed: adverse side effects have been found in patients treated with hormone K at another hospital." </p><p>He's lying; he'd never tell me that over the phone. "What sort of side effects?" </p><p>"Loss of vision. There's excessive growth of the optic nerve, followed by deterioration." </p><p>The CIA must have ordered this when they heard that I'd withdrawn from the study. Once I'm back in the hospital, Shea will declare me mentally incompetent, and confine me to their care. Then I'll be transferred to a government research institution. </p><p>I assume an expression of alarm. "I'll come down right away." </p><p>"Good." Shea is relieved that his delivery was convincing. "We can examine you as soon as you arrive." </p><p>I hang up and turn on my terminal to check the latest information in the FDA database. There's no mention of any adverse effects, on the optic nerve or anywhere else. I don't discount the possibility that such effects might arise in the future, but I'll discover them by myself. </p><p>It's time to leave Boston. I begin packing. I'll empty my bank accounts when I go. Selling the equipment in my studio would generate more cash, but most of it is too large to transport; I take only a few of the smallest pieces. After I've been working a couple of hours, the phone rings again: Shea wondering where I am. This time I let the machine pick it up. </p><p>"Leon, are you there? This is Dr. Shea. We've been expecting you for quite some time." </p><p>He'll try calling one more time, and then he'll send the orderlies in white suits, or perhaps the actual police, to pick me up. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Seven-thirty p.m. Shea is still in the hospital, waiting for news about me. I turn the ignition key and pull out of my parking spot across the street from the hospital. Any moment now, he'll notice the envelope I slipped under the door to his office. As soon as he opens it he'll realize that it's from me. </p><p>Greetings Dr. Shea;</p><p>I imagine you're looking for me. A moment of surprise, but no more than a moment; he'll regain his composure, and alert security to search the building for me, and check all vehicles leaving. Then he'll continue reading. </p><p>You can call off those burly orderlies who are waiting at my apartment; I don't want to waste their valuable time. You're probably determined to have the police issue an APB on me, though. Therefore, I've taken the liberty of inserting a virus in the DMV computer, that will substitute information whenever my license plate number is requested. Of course, you could give a description of my car, but you don't even know what it looks like, do you?</p><p>Leon</p><p>He'll call the police to have their programmers work on that virus. He'll conclude that I have a superiority complex, based on the arrogant tone of the note, the unnecessary risk taken in returning to the hospital to deliver it, and the pointless revelation of a virus which might otherwise have gone undetected. </p><p>Shea will be mistaken, though. Those actions are designed to make the police and CIA underestimate me, so I can rely on their not taking adequate precautions. After cleaning my virus from the DMV computer, the police programmers will assess my programming skill as good but not great, and then load the backups to retrieve my actual license number. This will activate a second virus, a far more sophisticated one. This one will modify both the backups and the active database. The police will be satisfied that they've got the correct license number, and spend their time chasing that wild goose. </p><p>My next goal is to get another ampule of hormone K. Doing so, unfortunately, will give the CIA an accurate idea of how capable I really am. If I hadn't sent that note, the police would discover my virus later, at a time when they'd know to take super-stringent precautions when eradicating it. In that case, I might never be able to remove my license number from their files. </p><p>Meanwhile, I've checked into a hotel, and am working out of the room's datanet terminal. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I've broken into the private database of the FDA. I've seen the addresses of the hormone K subjects, and the internal communications of the FDA. A clinical hold was instituted for hormone K: no further testing permitted until the hold is lifted. The CIA has insisted on capturing me and assessing my threat potential before the FDA goes any further. </p><p>The FDA has asked all the hospitals to return the remaining ampules by courier. I must get an ampule before this happens. The nearest patient is in Pittsburgh; I reserve a seat on a flight leaving early tomorrow morning. Then I check a map of Pittsburgh, and make a request to the Pennsylvania Courier company for a pick-up at an investment firm in the downtown area. Finally I sign up for several hours of CPU time on a supercomputer. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I'm parked in a rental car around the corner from a skyscraper in Pittsburgh. In my jacket pocket is a small circuit board with a keypad. I'm looking down the street in the direction the courier will arrive from; half the pedestrians wear white air filter masks, but visibility is good. </p><p>I see it two intersections away; it's a late-model domestic van, Pensylvania Courier painted on the side. It's not a high-security courier; the FDA isn't that worried about me. I get out of my car and begin walking toward the skyscraper. The van arrives shortly, parks, and the driver gets out. As soon as he's inside, I enter the vehicle. </p><p>It's just come from the hospital. The driver is on his way to the fortieth floor, expecting to pick up a package from an investment firm there. He won't be back for at least four minutes. </p><p>Welded to the floor of the van is a large locker, with double-layered steel walls and door. There is a polished plate on the door; the locker opens when the driver lays his palm against its surface. The plate also has a data port in its side, used for programming it. </p><p>Last night I penetrated the service database for Lucas Security Systems, the company that sells handprint locks to Pennsylvania Courier. There I found an encrypted file containing the codes to override their locks. </p><p>I must admit that, while penetrating computer security remains generally unaesthetic, certain aspects of it are indirectly related to very interesting problems in mathematics. For example, a commonly used method of encryption normally requires years of supercomputer time to break. However, during one of my forays into number theory, I found a lovely technique for factoring extremely large numbers. With this technique, a supercomputer could break this encryption scheme in a matter of hours. </p><p>I pull the circuit board from my pocket and connect it to the data port with a cable. I tap in a twelve digit number, and the locker door swings open. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>By the time I'm back in Boston with the ampule, the FDA has responded to the theft by removing all pertinent files from any computer accessible through the datanet: as expected. </p><p>With the ampule and my belongings, I drive to New York City. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>The fastest way for me to make money is, oddly enough, gambling. Handicapping horse races is simple enough. Without attracting undue attention, I can accumulate a moderate sum, and then sustain myself with investments in the stock market. </p><p>I'm staying in a room in the cheapest apartment I could find near New York that has datanet outlets. I've arranged several false names under which to make my investments, and will change them regularly. I shall spend some time on Wall Street, so that I can identify high-yield short-term opportunities from the body language of brokers. I won't go more than once a week; there are more significant matters to attend to, gestalts beckoning my attention. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>As my mind develops, so does my control over my body. It is a misconception to think that during evolution humans sacrificed physical skill in exchange for intelligence: wielding one's body is a mental activity. While my strength hasn't increased, my coordination is now well above average; I'm even becoming ambidextrous. Moreover, my powers of concentration make biofeedback techniques very effective. After comparatively little practice, I am able to raise or lower my heart rate and blood pressure. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I write a program to perform a pattern match for photos of my face, and search for occurrences of my name; I then incorporate it into a virus for scanning all public display files on the datanet. The CIA will have the national datanet news briefs display my picture and identify me as a dangerously insane escaped patient, perhaps a murderer. The virus will replace my photo with video static. I plant a similar virus in the FDA and CIA computers, to search for copies of my picture in any downloads to regional police. These viruses should be immune to anything that their programmers can come up with. </p><p>Undoubtably Shea and the other doctors are in consultation with the psychologists of the CIA, guessing where I might have gone. My parents are dead, so the CIA is turning its attention to my friends, asking whether I've contacted them; they'll maintain surveillance on them in the event I do. A regrettable invasion of their privacy, but it isn't a pressing matter. </p><p>It's unlikely that the CIA will treat any of their agents with hormone K to locate me. As I myself demonstrate, a superintelligent person is too difficult to control. However, I'll keep track of the other patients, in case the government decides to recruit them. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>The quotidian patterns of society are revealed without my making effort. I walk down the street, watching people go about their business, and though not a word is spoken, the subtext is conspicuous. A young couple strolls by, the adoration of one bouncing off the tolerance of the other. Apprehension flickers and becomes steady as a businessman, fearful of his supervisor, begins to doubt a decision he made earlier today. A woman wears a mantle of simulated sophistication, but it slips when it brushes past the genuine article. </p><p>As always, the roles one plays become recognizable only with greater maturity. To me, these people seem like children on a playground; I'm amused by their earnestness, and embarassed to remember myself doing those same things. Their activities are appropriate for them, but I couldn't bear to participate now; when I became a man, I put away childish things. I will deal with the world of normal humans only as needed to support myself. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I acquire years of education each week, assembling ever larger patterns. I view the tapestry of human knowledge from a broader perspective than anyone ever has before; I can fill gaps in the design where scholars never even noticed a lack, and enrich the texture in places that they felt were complete. </p><p>The natural sciences have the clearest patterns. Physics admits of a lovely unification, not just at the level of fundamental forces, but when considering its extent and implications. Classifications like "optics" or "thermodynamics" are just straitjackets, preventing physicists from seeing countless intersections. Even putting aside aesthetics, the practical applications that have been overlooked are legion; years ago engineers could have been artifically generating spherically symmetric gravity fields. </p><p>Having realized this, however, I won't build such a device, or any other. It would require many custom-built components, all difficult and time-consuming to procure. Furthermore, actually constructing the device wouldn't give me any particular satisfaction, since I already know it would work, and it wouldn't illuminate any new gestalts. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I'm writing part of an extended poem, as an experiment; after I've finished one canto, I'll be able to choose an approach for integrating the patterns within all the arts. I'm employing six modern and four ancient languages; they include most of the significant worldviews of human civilization. Each one provides different shades of meaning and poetic effects; some of the juxtapositions are delightful. Each line of the poem contains neologisms, born by extruding words through the declensions of another language. If I were to complete the entire piece, it could be thought of Finnegans Wake multiplied by Pound's Cantos.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>The CIA interrupts my work; they're baiting a trap for me. After two months of trying, they've accepted that they can't locate me by conventional methods, so they've turned to more drastic measures. The news services report that the girlfriend of a deranged murderer has been charged with aiding and abetting his escape. The name given is Connie Perritt, someone I was seeing last year. If it goes to trial, it's a foregone conclusion that she'll be sentenced to a lengthy prison term; the CIA is hoping that I won't allow that. They expect me to attempt a maneuver that will expose me to capture. </p><p>Connie's preliminary hearing is tomorrow. They'll insure that she's released on bail, through a bondsman if necessary, to give me an opportunity to contact her. Then they'll saturate the area around her apartment with undercover agents to wait for me. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I begin editing the first image on screen. These digital photos are so minimal compared to holos, but they serve the purpose. The photos, taken yesterday, show the exterior of Connie's apartment building, the street out front, and nearby intersections. I move the cursor across the screen, drawing small crosshairs in certain locations on the images. A window, with lights out but curtains open, in the building diagonally opposite. A street vendor two blocks from the rear of the building. </p><p>I mark six locations altogether. They indicate where CIA agents were waiting last night, when Connie went back to her apartment. Having been cued by the videotapes of me in the hospital, they knew what to look for in all male or ambiguous passerbys: the confident, level gait. Their expectations worked against them; I simply lengthened my strides, bobbed my head up and down a bit, reduced my arm motion. That and some atypical clothes were sufficient for them to ignore me as I walked through the area. </p><p>At the bottom of one photo I type the radio frequency used by the agents for communication, and an equation describing the scrambling algorithm employed. Once I've finished, I transmit the images to the Director of the CIA. The implication is clear: I could kill his undercover agents at any time, unless they withdraw. </p><p>To have them drop charges against Connie, and for a more permanent deterrent against the CIA's distractions, I shall have to do some more work. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Pattern recognition again, but this time it's of a mundane variety. Thousands of pages of reports, memos, correspondence; each one is a dot of color in a pointillist painting. I step back from this panorama, watching for lines and edges to emerge and create a pattern. The megabytes that I scanned constituted only a fraction of the complete records for the period I investigated, but they were enough. </p><p>What I've found is rather ordinary, far simpler than the plot of a spy novel. The Director of the CIA was aware of a terrorist group's plan to bomb the Washington, D.C. metro system. He let the bombing occur, in order to gain Congressional approval for the use of extreme measures against that group. A congressman's son was among the casualties, and the CIA director was given a free hand in handling the terrorists. While his plans aren't actually stated in CIA records, they're implied quite clearly. The relevant memos make only oblique references, and they float in a sea of innocuous documents; if an investigating committee were to read all of the records, the evidence would be drowned out by the noise. However, a distillation of the incriminating memos would certainly convince the press. </p><p>I send the list of memos to the Director of the CIA, with a note: "Don't bother me, and I won't bother you." He'll realize that he has no alternative. </p><p>This little episode has reinforced my opinion of the affairs of the world; I could detect clandestine ploys everywhere if I kept informed about current events, but none of them would be interesting. I shall resume my studies. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Control over my body continues to grow. By now I could walk on hot coals or stick needles in my arm, if I were so inclined. However, my interest in Eastern meditation is limited to its application to physical control; no meditative trance I can attain is nearly as desirable to me as my mental state when I assemble gestalts out of elemental data. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I'm designing a new language. I've reached the limits of conventional languages, and now they frustrate my attempts to progress further. They lack the power to express concepts that I need, and even in their own domain, they're imprecise and unwieldy. They're hardly fit for speech, let alone thought. </p><p>Existing linguistic theory is useless; I'll reevaluate basic logic to determine the suitable atomic components for my language. This language will support a dialect co-expressive with all of mathematics, so that any equation I write will have a linguistic equivalent. However, mathematics will be only a small part of the language, not the whole; unlike Leibniz, I recognize symbolic logic's limits. Other dialects I have planned will be co-expressive with my notations for aesthetics and cognition. This will be a time-consuming project, but the end result will clarify my thoughts enormously. After I've translated all that I know into this language, the patterns I seek should become evident. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I pause in my work. Before I develop a notation for aesthetics, I must establish a vocabulary for all the emotions I can imagine. </p><p>I'm aware of many emotions beyond those of normal humans; I see how limited their affective range is. I don't deny the validity of the love and angst I once felt, but I do see them for what they were: like the infatuations and depressions of childhood, they were just the forerunners of what I experience now. My passions now are more multifaceted; as self-knowledge increases, all emotions become exponentially more complex. I must be able to describe them fully if I'm to even attempt the composing tasks ahead. </p><p>Of course, I actually experience far fewer emotions than I could; my development is limited by the intelligence of those around me, and the scant intercourse I permit myself with them. I'm reminded of the Confucian concept of ren: inadequately conveyed by "benevolence," that quality which is quintessentially human, which can only be cultivated through interaction with others, and which a solitary person cannot manifest. It's one of many such qualities. And here am I, with people, people everywhere, yet not a one to interact with. I'm only a fraction of what a complete individual with my intelligence could be. </p><p>I don't delude myself with either self-pity or conceit: I can evaluate my own psychological state with the utmost objectivity and consistency. I know precisely which emotional resources I have and which I lack, and how much value I place on each. I have no regrets. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>My new language is taking shape. It is gestalt-oriented, rendering it beautifully suited for thought, but impractical for writing or speech. It wouldn't be transcribed in the form of words arranged linearly, but as a giant ideogram, to be absorbed as a whole. Such an ideogram could convey, more deliberately than a picture, what a thousand words cannot. The intricacy of each ideogram would be commensurate with the amount of information contained; I amuse myself with the notion of a colossal ideogram that describes the entire universe. </p><p>The printed page is too clumsy and static for this language; the only serviceable media would be video or holo, displaying a time-evolving graphic image. Speaking this language would be out of the question, given the limited bandwidth of the human larynx. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>My mind seethes with expletives from ancient and modern languages, and they taunt me with their crudeness, reminding me that my ideal language would offer terms with sufficient venom to express my present frustration. </p><p>I cannot complete my artificial language; it's too large a project for my present tools. Weeks of concentrated effort have yielded nothing usable. I've attempted to write it via bootstrapping, by employing the rudimentary language that I've already defined to rewrite the language and produce successively fuller versions. Yet each new version only highlights its own inadequacies, forcing me to expand my ultimate goal, condemning it to the status of a Holy Grail at the end of a divergent infinite regress. This is no better than trying to create it ex nihilo.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>What about my fourth ampule? I can't remove it from my thoughts: every frustration I experience at my present plateau reminds me of the possibility for still greater heights. </p><p>Of course, there are significant risks. This injection might be the one that causes brain damage or insanity. Temptation by the Devil, perhaps, but temptation nonetheless. I find no reason to resist. </p><p>I'd have a margin of safety if I injected myself in a hospital, or, failing that, with someone standing by in my apartment. However, I imagine the injection will either be successful or else cause irreparable damage, so I forego those precautions. </p><p>I order equipment from a medical supply company, and assemble an apparatus for administering the spinal injection by myself. It may take days for the full effects to become evident, so I'll confine myself to my bedroom. It's possible that my reaction will be violent; I remove breakables from the room and attach loose straps to the bed. The neighbors will interpret anything they hear as an addict howling. </p><p>I inject myself and wait. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>My brain is on fire, my spine burns itself through my back, I feel near apoplexy. I am blind, deaf, insensate. </p><p>I hallucinate. Seen with such preternatural clarity and contrast that they must be illusory, unspeakable horrors loom all around me, scenes not of physical violence but of psychic mutilation. </p><p>Mental agony and orgasm. Terror and hysterical laughter. </p><p>For a brief moment, perception returns. I'm on the floor, hands clenched in my hair, some uprooted tufts lying around me. My clothes are soaked in sweat. I've bitten my tongue, and my throat is raw: from screaming, I surmise. Convulsions have left my body badly bruised, and a concussion is likely given the contusions on the back of my head, but I feel nothing. Has it been hours or moments? </p><p>Then my vision clouds and the roar returns. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Critical mass. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Revelation. </p><p>I understand the mechanism of my own thinking. I know precisely how I know, and my understanding is recursive. I understand the infinite regress of this self-knowing, not by proceeding step by step endlessly, but by apprehending the limit. The nature of recursive cognition is clear to me. A new meaning of the term "self-aware." </p><p>Fiat logos. I know my mind in terms of a language more expressive than any I'd previously imagined. Like God creating order from chaos with an utterance, I make myself anew with this language. It is meta-self-descriptive and -self-editing; not only can it describe thought, it can describe and modify its own operations as well, at all levels. What G�del would have given to see this language, where modifying a statement causes the entire grammar to be adjusted. </p><p>With this language, I can see how my mind is operating. I don't pretend to see my own neurons firing; such claims belong to John Lilly and his LSD experiments of the sixties. What I can do is perceive the gestalts; I see the mental structures forming, interacting. I see myself thinking, and I see the equations that describe my thinking, and I see myself comprehending the equations, and I see how the equations describe their being comprehended. </p><p>I know how they make up my thoughts. </p><p>These thoughts. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Initially I am overwhelmed by all this input, paralyzed with awareness of my self. It is hours before I can control the flood of self-describing information. I haven't filtered it away, nor pushed it into the background. It's become integrated into my mental processes, for use during my normal activities. It will be longer before I can take advantage of it, effortlessly and effectively, the way a dancer uses her kinesthesic knowledge. </p><p>All that I once knew theoretically about my mind, I now see detailed explicitly. The undercurrents of sex, aggression, and self-preservation, translated by the conditioning of my childhood, clash with and are sometimes disguised as rational thought. I recognize all the causes of my every mood, the motives behind my every decision. </p><p>What can I do with this knowledge? Much of what is conventionally described as "personality" is at my discretion; the higher-level aspects of my psyche define who I am now. I can send my mind into a variety of mental or emotional states, yet remain ever aware of the state and able to restore my original condition. Now that I understand the mechanisms that were operating when I attended to two tasks at once, I can divide my consciousness, simultaneously devoting almost full concentration and gestalt recognition abilities to two or more separate problems, meta-aware of all of them. What can't I do? </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I know my body afresh, as if it were an amputee's stump suddenly replaced by a watchmaker's hand. Controlling my voluntary muscles is trivial; I have inhuman coordination. Skills that normally require thousands of repetitions to develop, I can learn in two or three. I find a video with a shot of a pianist's hands playing, and before long I can duplicate his finger movements without a keyboard in front of me. Selective contraction and relaxation of muscles improve my strength and flexibility. Muscular response time is thirty-five milliseconds, for conscious or reflex action. Learning acrobatics and martial arts would require little training. </p><p>I have somatic awareness of kidney function, nutrient absorption, glandular secretions. I am even conscious of the role that neurotransmitters play in my thoughts. This state of consciousness involves mental activity more intense than in any epinephrine-boosted stress situation; part of my mind is maintaining a condition that would kill a normal mind and body within minutes. As I adjust the programming of my mind, I experience the ebb and flow of all the substances that trigger my emotional reactions, boost my attention, or subtly shape my attitudes. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>And then I look outward. </p><p>Blinding, joyous, fearful symmetry surrounds me. So much is incorporated within patterns now that the entire universe verges on resolving itself into a picture. I'm closing in on the ultimate gestalt: the context in which all knowledge fits and is illuminated, a mandala, the music of the spheres, kosmos.</p><p>I seek enlightenment, not spiritual but rational. I must go still further to reach it, but this time the goal will not be perpetually retreating from my fingertips. With my mind's language, the distance between myself and enlightenment is precisely calculable. I've sighted my final destination. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Now I must plan my next actions. First, there are the simple enhancements to self-preservation, starting with martial arts training. I will watch some tournaments to study possible attacks, though I will take only defensive action; I can move rapidly enough to avoid contact with even the fastest striking techniques. This will let me protect myself and disarm any street criminals, should I be assaulted. Meanwhile, I must eat copious amounts of food to meet my brain's nourishment requirements, even given increased efficiency in my metabolism. I shall also shave my scalp, to allow greater radiative cooling for the heightened blood flow to my head. </p><p>Then there is the primary goal: decoding those patterns. For further improvements to my mind, artificial enhancements are the only possibility. A direct computer-mind link, permitting mind downloading, is what I need, but I must create a new technology to implement it. Anything based on digital computation will be inadequate; what I have in mind requires nano-scale structures based on neural networks. </p><p>Once I have the basic ideas laid out, I set my mind to multiprocessing: one section of my mind deriving a branch of mathematics that reflects the networks' behavior; another developing a process for replicating the formation of neural pathways on a molecular scale in a self-repairing bioceramic medium; a third devising tactics for guiding private industrial R &amp; D to produce what I'll need. I cannot waste time: I will introduce explosive theoretical and technical breakthroughs so that my new industry will hit the ground running. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I've gone into the outside world to re-observe society. The sign language of emotion I once knew has been replaced by a matrix of interrelated equations. Lines of force twist and elongate between people, objects, institutions, ideas. The individuals are tragically like marionettes, independently animate but bound by a web they choose not to see; they could resist if they wished, but so few of them do. </p><p>At the moment I'm sitting at a bar. Three stools to my right sits a man, familiar with this type of establishment, who looks around and notices a couple in a dark corner booth. He smiles, motions for the bartender to come over, and leans forward to speak confidentially about the couple. I don't need to listen to know what he's saying. </p><p>He's lying to the bartender, easily, extemporaneously. A compulsive liar, not out of a desire for a life more exciting than his own, but to revel in his facility for deceiving others. He knows the bartender is detached, merely affecting interest -- which is true -- but he knows the bartender is still fooled -- which is also true. </p><p>My sensitivity to the body language of others has increased to the point that I can make these observations without sight or sound: I can smell the pheromones exuded by his skin. To an extent, my muscles can even detect the tension within his, perhaps by their electric field. These channels can't convey precise information, but the impressions I receive provide ample basis for extrapolation; they add texture to the web. </p><p>Normal humans may detect these emanations subliminally. I'll work on becoming more attuned to them; then perhaps I can try consciously controlling my own expressions. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I've developed abilities reminiscent of the mind control schemes offered by tabloid advertisements. My control over my somatic emanations now lets me provoke precise reactions in others. With pheromones and muscle tension, I can cause another person to respond with anger, fear, sympathy or sexual arousal. Certainly enough to win friends and influence people. </p><p>I can even induce a self-sustaining reaction in others. By associating a particular response with a sense of satisfaction, I can create a positive reinforcement loop, like biofeedback; the person's body will strengthen the reaction on its own. I'll use this on corporate presidents to create support for the industries I'll need. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I can no longer dream in any normal sense. I lack anything that would qualify as a subconscious, and I control all the maintenance functions performed by my brain, so normal REM sleep tasks are obsolete. There are moments when my grasp on my mind slips, but they cannot be called dreams. Meta-hallucinations, perhaps. Sheer torture. These are periods during which I'm detached: I understand how my mind generates the strange visions, but I'm paralyzed and unable to respond. I can scarcely identify what I see; images of bizarre transfinite self-references and modifications that even I find nonsensical. </p><p>My mind is taxing the resources of my brain. A biological structure of this size and complexity can just barely sustain a self-knowing psyche. But the self-knowing psyche is also self-regulating, to an extent. I give my mind full use of what's available, and restrain it from expanding beyond that. But it's difficult: I'm cramped inside a bamboo cage that doesn't let me sit down or stand up. If I try to relax, or try to extend myself fully, then agony, madness. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I'm hallucinating. I see my mind imagining possible configurations it could assume, and then collapsing. I witness my own delusions, my visions of what form my mind might take when I grasp the ultimate gestalts. </p><p>Will I achieve ultimate self-awareness? Could I discover the components that make up my own mental gestalts? Would I penetrate racial memory? Would I find innate knowledge of morality? I might determine whether mind could be spontaneously generated from matter, and understand what relates consciousness with the rest of the universe. I might see how to merge subject and object: the zero experience. </p><p>Or perhaps I'd find that the mind gestalt cannot be generated, and some sort of intervention is required. Perhaps I would see the soul, the ingredient of consciousness that surpasses physicality. Proof of God? I would behold the meaning, the true character of existence. </p><p>I would be enlightened. It must be euphoric to experience... </p><p>My mind collapses back into a state of sanity. I must keep a tighter rein over my self. When I'm in control at the metaprogramming level, my mind is perfectly self-repairing; I could restore myself from states that resemble delusion or amnesia. But if I drift too far on the metaprogramming level, my mind might become an unstable structure, and then I would slide into a state beyond mere insanity. I will program my mind to forbid itself from moving beyond its own reprogramming range. </p><p>These hallucinations strengthen my resolve to create an artificial brain. Only with such a structure will I be able to actually perceive those gestalts, instead of merely dreaming about them. To achieve enlightenment, I'll need to exceed another critical mass in terms of neuronal analogs. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I open my eyes: it's two hours, twenty-eight minutes, and ten seconds since I closed my eyes to rest, though not to sleep. I rise from bed. </p><p>I request a listing of my stocks' performance on my terminal. I look down the flatscreen, and freeze. </p><p>The screen shouts at me. It tells me that there is another person with an enhanced mind. </p><p>Five of my investments have demonstrated losses; they're not precipitous, but large enough that I'd have detected them in the body language of the stockbrokers. Reading down the alphabetical list, the initial letters of the corporations whose stock values have dropped are: C, E, G, O, and R. Which when rearranged, spell GRECO. </p><p>Someone is sending me a message. </p><p>There's someone else out there like me. There must have been another comatose patient who received a third injection of hormone K. He erased his file from the FDA database before I accessed it, and supplied false input to his doctors' accounts so that they wouldn't notice. He too stole another ampule of the hormone, contributing to the FDA's closing of their files, and with his whereabouts unknown to the authorities, he's reached my level. </p><p>He must have recognized me through the investment patterns of my false identities; he'd have to have been supercritical to do that. As an enhanced individual, he could have effected sudden and precise changes to trigger my losses, and attract my attention. </p><p>I check various data services for stock quotes; the entries on my listing are correct, so my counterpart didn't simply edit the values for my account alone. He altered the selling patterns of the stock of five unrelated corporations, for the sake of a word. It makes for quite a demonstration; I consider it no mean feat. </p><p>Presumably his treatment began before mine did, meaning that he is farther along than I, but by how much? I begin extrapolating his likely progress, and will incorporate new information as I acquire it. </p><p>The critical question: is he friend or foe? Was this merely a good-natured demonstration of his power, or an indication of his intent to ruin me? The amounts I lost were moderate; does this indicate concern for me, or for the corporations which he had to manipulate? Given all the harmless ways he could have attracted my attention, I must assume that he is to some degree hostile. </p><p>In which case, I am at risk, vulnerable to anything from another prank to a fatal attack. As a precaution, I will leave immediately. Obviously, if he were actively hostile, I'd be dead already. His sending a message means that he wishes us to play games. I'll have to place myself on equal terms with him: hide my location, determine his identity, and then attempt to communicate. </p><p>I pick a city at random: Memphis. I switch off the flatscreen, get dressed, pack a travel bag, and collect all the emergency cash in the apartment. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>In a Memphis hotel, I begin working at the suite's datanet terminal. The first thing I do is reroute my activities through several dummy terminals; to an ordinary police trace, my queries will appear to originate from different terminals all over the state of Utah. A military intelligence facility might be able to track them to a terminal in Houston; continuing the trace to Memphis would try even me. An alarm program at the Houston terminal will alert me if someone has successfully traced me there. </p><p>How many clues to his identity has my twin erased? Lacking all FDA files, I'll begin with the files of courier services in various cities, looking for deliveries from the FDA to hospitals during the time of the hormone K study. Then a check of the hospital's brain-damage cases at that time, and I'll have a place to start. </p><p>Even if any of this information remains, it's of minor value. What will be crucial is an examination of the investment patterns, to find the traces of an enhanced mind. This will take time. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>His name is Reynolds. He's originally from Phoenix, and his early progress closely parallels mine. He received his third injection six months and four days ago, giving him a head start over me of fifteen days. He didn't erase any of the obvious records. He waits for me to find him. I estimate that he's been supercritical for twelve days, twice as long as I've been. </p><p>I now see his hand in the investment patterns, but the task of locating Reynolds is Herculean. I examine usage logs across the datanet to identify the accounts he's penetrated. I have twelve lines open on my terminal. I'm using two single-hand keyboards and a throat-mike, so I can work on three queries simultaneously. Most of my body is immobile; to prevent fatigue, I'm insuring proper blood flow, regular muscle contraction and relaxation, and removal of lactic acid. While I absorb all the data I see, studying the melody within the notes, looking for the epicenter of a tremor in the web. </p><p>Hours pass. We both scan gigabytes of data, circling each other. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>His location is Philadelphia. He waits for me to arrive. </p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>I'm riding in a mud-splattered taxi to Reynolds' apartment. </p><p>Judging by the databases and agencies Reynolds has queried over the past months, his private research involves bio-engineered microorganisms for toxic waste disposal, inertial containment for practical fusion, and subliminal dissemination of information through societies of various structures. He plans to save the world, to protect it from itself. And his opinion of me is therefore unfavorable. </p><p>I've shown no interest in the affairs of the external world, and made no investigations for aiding the normals. Neither of us will be able to convert the other. I view the world as incidental to my aims, while he cannot allow someone with enhanced intelligence to work purely in self-interest. My plans for mind-computer links will have enormous repercussions for the world, provoking government or popular reactions that would interfere with his plans. As I am proverbially not part of the solution, I am part of the problem. </p><p>If we were members of a society of enhanced minds, the nature of human interaction would be of a different order. But in this society, we have unavoidably become juggernauts, by whose measure the actions of normals are inconsequential. Even if we were twelve thousand miles apart we couldn't ignore each other. A resolution is necessary. </p><p>Both of us have dispensed with several rounds of games. There are a thousand ways we could have attempted to kill the other, from painting neurotoxin laced-DMSO on a doorknob to ordering a surgical strike from a military killsat. We both could have swept the physical area and datanet for each of the myriad possibilities beforehand, and set more traps for each other's sweeps. But neither of us has done any of that, has felt a need to check for those things. A simple infinite regression of second-guessing and double-thinking has dismissed those. What will be decisive are those preparations that we could not predict. </p><p>The taxi stops; I pay the driver and walk up to the apartment building. The electric lock on the door opens for me. I take off my coat and climb four flights.</p><p>The door to Reynolds' apartment is also open. I walk down the entryway to the living room, hearing a hyperaccelerated polyphony from a digital synthesizer. Evidently it's his own work; the sounds are modulated in ways undetectable to normal hearing, and even I can't discern any pattern to them. An experiment in high-information density music, perhaps. </p><p>There is a large swivel chair in the room, its back turned toward me. Reynolds is not visible, and he is restricting his somatic emanations to comatose levels. I imply my presence and my recognition of his identity. </p><p>&lt;<reynolds.>&gt; </reynolds.></p><p>Acknowledgement. &lt;<greco.>&gt; </greco.></p><p>The chair turns around smoothly, slowly. He smiles at me and shuts off the synthesizer at his side. Gratification. &lt;<a pleasure="" to="" meet="" you.="">&gt; </a></p><p><a pleasure="" to="" meet="" you.="">To communicate, we are exchanging fragments from the somatic language of the normals: a shorthand version of the vernacular. Each phrase takes a tenth of a second. I give a suggestion of regret. &lt;</a><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">&gt; </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">Wistful agreement, then supposition. &lt;<indeed. imagine="" how="" we="" could="" change="" the="" world,="" acting="" in="" concert.="" two="" enhanced="" minds;="" such="" an="" opportunity="" missed.="">&gt; </indeed.></a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">True, acting cooperatively would produce achievements far outstripping any we might attain individually. Any interaction would be incredibly fruitful: how satisfying it would be to simply have a discussion with someone who can match my speed, who can offer an idea that is new to me, who can hear the same melodies I do. He desires the same. It pains us both to think that one of us will not leave this room alive. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">An offer. &lt;<do you="" wish="" to="" share="" what="" we've="" learned="" in="" the="" past="" six="" months?="">&gt; </do></a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">He knows what my answer is. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">We will speak aloud, since somatic language has no technical vocabulary. Reynolds says, quickly and quietly, five words. They are more pregnant with meaning than any stanza of poetry: each word provides a logical toehold I can mount after extracting everything implicit in the preceding ones. Together they encapsulate a revolutionary insight into sociology; using somatic language he indicates that it was among the first he ever achieved. I came to a similar realization, but formulated it differently. I immediately counter with seven words, four that summarize the distinctions between my insight and his, and three that describe a non-obvious result of the distinctions. He responds. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">We continue. We are like two bards, each cueing the other to extemporize another stanza, jointly composing an epic poem of knowledge. Within moments we accelerate, talking over each other's words but hearing every nuance, until we are absorbing, concluding, and responding, continuously, simultaneously, synergistically. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">Many minutes pass. I learn much from him, and he from me. It's exhilarating, to be suddenly awash in ideas whose implications would take me days to consider fully. But we're also gathering strategic information: I infer the extent of his unspoken knowledge, compare it with my own, and simulate his corresponding inferences. For there is always the awareness that this must come to an end; the formulation of our exchanges renders ideological differences luminously clear. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">Reynolds hasn't witnessed the beauty that I have; he's stood before lovely insights, oblivious to them. The sole gestalt that inspires him is the one I ignored: that of the planetary society, of the biosphere. I am a lover of beauty, he of humanity. Each feels that the other has ignored great opportunities. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">He has an unmentioned plan for establishing a global network of influence, to create world prosperity. To execute it, he'll employ a number of people, some of whom he'll give simple heightened intelligence, some meta-self awareness; a few of them will pose threats to him. &lt;<why assume="" such="" a="" risk="" for="" the="" sake="" of="" normals?="">&gt; </why></a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">&lt;<your indifference="" toward="" the="" normals="" would="" be="" justified="" if="" you="" were="" enlightened;="" your="" realm="" wouldn't="" intersect="" theirs.="" but="" as="" long="" and="" i="" can="" still="" comprehend="" their="" affairs,="" we="" can't="" ignore="" them.="">&gt; </your></a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">I can measure the distance between our respective moral stances precisely, see the stress between their incompatible radiating lines. What motivates him is not simply compassion or altruism, but something that entails both those things. On the other hand, I concentrate only on understanding the sublime. &lt;<what about="" the="" beauty="" visible="" from="" enlightenment?="" doesn't="" it="" attract="" you?="">&gt; </what></a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">&lt;<you know="" what="" kind="" of="" structure="" would="" be="" required="" to="" hold="" an="" enlightened="" consciousness.="" i="" have="" no="" reason="" wait="" the="" time="" it="" take="" establish="" necessary="" industries.="">&gt; </you></a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">He considers intelligence to be a means, while I view it as an end in itself. Greater intelligence would be of little use to him. At his present level, he can find the best possible solution to any problem within the realm of human experience, and many beyond. All he'd require is sufficient time to implement his solution. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">There's no point in further discussion. By mutual assent, we begin. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">It's meaningless to speak of an element of surprise when we time our attacks; our awareness can't become more acute with forewarning. It's not affording a courtesy to each other when we agree to begin our battle, it's actualizing the inevitable. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">In the models of each other that we've constructed from our inferences, there are gaps, lacunae: the internal psychological developments and discoveries that each has made. No echoes have radiated from those spaces, no strands have tied them to the world web, until now. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">I begin. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">I concentrate on initiating two reinforcing loops in him. One is very simple: it increases blood pressure rapidly and enormously. If it were to continue unchecked for over a second, this loop would raise his blood pressure to stroke levels -- perhaps 300 over 200 -- and burst capillaries in his brain. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">Reynolds detects it immediately. Though it's clear from our conversation that he never investigated the inducement of biofeedback loops in others, he recognizes what is happening. Once he does, he reduces his heart rate and dilates the blood vessels throughout his body. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">But it is the other, subtler reinforcing loop that is my real attack. This is a weapon I've been developing ever since my search for Reynolds began. This loop causes his neurons to dramatically overproduce neurotransmitter antagonists, preventing impulses from crossing his synapses, shutting down brain activity. I've been radiating this loop at a much higher intensity than the other. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">As Reynolds is parrying the ostensible attack, he experiences a slight weakening of his concentration, masked by the effects of the heightened blood pressure. A second later, his body begins to amplify the effect on its own. Reynolds is shocked to feel his thoughts blurring. He searches for the precise mechanism: he'll identify it soon, but he won't be able to scrutinize it for long. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">Once his brain function has been reduced to the level of a normal, I should be able to manipulate his mind easily. Hypnotic techniques can make him regurgitate most of the information his enhanced mind possesses. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">I inspect his somatic expressions, watching them betray his diminishing intelligence. The regression is unmistakeable. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">And then it stops. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">Reynolds is in equilibrium. I'm stunned. He was able to break the reinforcing loop. He has stopped the most sophisticated offensive I could mount. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">Next, he reverses the damage already done. Even starting with reduced capabilities, he can correct the balance of neurotransmitters. Within seconds, Reynolds is fully restored. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">I too was transparent to him. During our conversation he deduced that I had investigated reinforcing loops, and as we communicated, he derived a general preventative without my detecting it. Then he observed the specifics of my particular attack while it was working, and learned how to reverse its effects. I am astonished at his discernment, his speed, his stealth. </a></p><p><a shame="" it="" must="" be="" as="" enemies.="">He acknowledges my skill. &lt;</a><a very="" interesting="" technique;="" appropriate,="" given="" your="" self-absorption.="" i="" saw="" no="" indication="" when--="">&gt; abruptly he projects a different somatic signature, one that I recognize. He used it when he walked behind me at a grocery store, three days ago. The aisle was crowded; around me were an old woman, wheezing behind her air filter, and a thin teenager on an acid trip, wearing a liquid crystal shirt of shifting psychedelic patterns. Reynolds slipped behind me, his mind on the porn mag stands. His surveillance didn't inform him of my reinforcing loops, but it did permit a more detailed picture of my mind. </a></p><p><a very="" interesting="" technique;="" appropriate,="" given="" your="" self-absorption.="" i="" saw="" no="" indication="" when--="">A possibility I anticipated. I reformulate my psyche, incorporating random elements for unpredictability. The equations of my mind now bear little resemblance to those of my normal consciousness, undermining any assumptions Reynolds may have made, and rendering ineffectual any psyche-specific weapons of his. </a></p><p><a very="" interesting="" technique;="" appropriate,="" given="" your="" self-absorption.="" i="" saw="" no="" indication="" when--="">I project the equivalent of a smile. </a></p><p><a very="" interesting="" technique;="" appropriate,="" given="" your="" self-absorption.="" i="" saw="" no="" indication="" when--="">Reynolds smiles back. &lt;<have you="" ever="" considered="" --="">&gt; Suddenly he projects only silence. He is about to speak, but I can't predict what. Then it comes, as a whisper: "-- self-destruct commands, Greco?" </have></a></p><p><a very="" interesting="" technique;="" appropriate,="" given="" your="" self-absorption.="" i="" saw="" no="" indication="" when--="">As he says it, a lacuna in my reconstruction of him fills and overflows, the implications coloring all that I know about him. He means the Word: the sentence that, when uttered, would destroy the mind of the listener. Reynolds is claiming that the myth is true, that every mind has such a trigger built in; that for every person, there is a sentence that can reduce him to an idiot, a lunatic, a catatonic. And he is claiming he knows the one for me. </a></p><p><a very="" interesting="" technique;="" appropriate,="" given="" your="" self-absorption.="" i="" saw="" no="" indication="" when--="">I immediately tune out all sensory input, directing it to an insulated buffer of short-term memory. Then I conceive a simulator of my own consciousness to receive the input and absorb it at reduced speed. As a metaprogrammer I will monitor the equations of the simulation indirectly. Only after the sensory information has been confirmed as safe will I actually receive it. If the simulator is destroyed, my consciousness should be isolated, and I'll retrace the individual steps leading to the crash and derive guidelines for reprogramming my psyche. </a></p><p><a very="" interesting="" technique;="" appropriate,="" given="" your="" self-absorption.="" i="" saw="" no="" indication="" when--="">I get everything in place by the time Reynolds has finished saying my name; his next sentence could be the destruct command. I'm now receiving my sensory input with a one hundred and twenty millisecond time lag. I reexamine my analysis of the human mind, explicitly searching for evidence to verify his assertion. </a></p><p><a very="" interesting="" technique;="" appropriate,="" given="" your="" self-absorption.="" i="" saw="" no="" indication="" when--="">Meanwhile I give my response lightly, casually. &lt;<hit me="" with="" your="" best="" shot.="">&gt; </hit></a></p><p><a very="" interesting="" technique;="" appropriate,="" given="" your="" self-absorption.="" i="" saw="" no="" indication="" when--="">&lt;<don't worry;="" it's="" not="" on="" the="" tip="" of="" my="" tongue.="">&gt; </don't></a></p><p><a very="" interesting="" technique;="" appropriate,="" given="" your="" self-absorption.="" i="" saw="" no="" indication="" when--="">My search produces something.

A single command can reduce any subcritical mind to a tabula rasa, but an undetermined degree of customization is needed for enhanced minds. The erasure has distinctive symptoms, which my simulator can alert me to, but those are symptoms of a process calculable by me. By definition the destruct command is that specific equation beyond my ability to imagine; would my metaprogrammer collapse while diagnosing the simulator's condition? </a></p><p><a very="" interesting="" technique;="" appropriate,="" given="" your="" self-absorption.="" i="" saw="" no="" indication="" when--="">&lt;<have you="" used="" the="" destruct="" command="" on="" normals?="">&gt; I begin calculating what's needed to generate a customized destruct command. </have></a></p><p><a very="" interesting="" technique;="" appropriate,="" given="" your="" self-absorption.="" i="" saw="" no="" indication="" when--="">&lt;<once, as="" an="" experiment="" on="" a="" drug="" dealer.="" afterward="" i="" concealed="" the="" evidence="" with="" blow="" to="" temple.="">&gt; </once,></a></p><p><a very="" interesting="" technique;="" appropriate,="" given="" your="" self-absorption.="" i="" saw="" no="" indication="" when--="">It becomes obvious that the generation is a colossal task.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>French law enforcement may soon have far-reaching authority to snoop on alleged criminals. Lawmakers in France's National Assembly have <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2023/07/06/france-set-to-allow-police-to-spy-through-phones_6044269_7.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:1;pos:1;itc:0">passed</a> a bill that lets police surveil suspects by remotely activating cameras, microphones and GPS location systems on phones and other devices. A judge will have to approve use of the powers, and the recently amended bill forbids use against journalists, lawyers and other "sensitive professions," according to <em>Le Monde</em>. The measure is also meant to limit use to serious cases, and only for a maximum of six months. Geolocation would be limited to crimes that are punishable by at least five years in prison.</p>
<p>An earlier version of the bill passed the Senate, but the amendment will require that legislative body's approval before it can become law.</p>
<p>Civil liberties advocates are alarmed. The digital rights group La Quadrature du Net previously <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.laquadrature.net/2023/05/31/transformer-les-objets-connectes-en-mouchards-la-surenchere-securitaire-du-gouvernement/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:2;pos:1;itc:0">pointed</a> out the potential for abuse. As the bill isn't clear about what constitutes a serious crime, there are fears the French government might use this to target environmental activists and others who aren't grave threats. The organization also notes that worrying security policies have a habit of expanding to less serious  crimes. Genetic registration was only used for sex offenders at first, La Quadrature says, but is now being used for most crimes.</p>
<p>The group further notes that the remote access may depend on security vulnerabilities. Police would be exploiting security holes instead of telling manufacturers how to patch those holes, La Quadrature says.</p>
<p>Justice Minister Éric Dupond-Moretti says the powers would only be used for "dozens" of cases per year, and that this was "far away" from the surveillance state of Orwell's <em>1984</em>. It will save lives, the politician argues.</p>
<p>The legislation comes as concerns about government device surveillance are growing. There's been a backlash against NSO Group, whose Pegasus spyware has allegedly been misused to spy on dissidents, activists and <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/pegasus-spyware-found-on-phones-of-mexican-presidents-close-ally-154511274.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:3;pos:1;itc:0">even politicians</a>. While the French bill is more focused, it's not exactly reassuring to those worried about government overreach.</p></div></div>]]></description>

	  	 <h2>
				 Why customers don’t want chat bots
				 <br>
       
                 </h2>

<p>I came across an intriguing comment recently by Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI and public face of ChatGPT. Altman has been in the news quite a bit during his global PR tour, including an appearance at a U.S. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/16/technology/openai-altman-artificial-intelligence-regulation.html" target="_blank">Senate hearing</a> last Tuesday, during which he asked for Congressional regulation of AI.</p>

<p>The Senate hearing was sanitized and tame, showing off Altman as a calm and relatable technologist. At one point, Sen. Kennedy asked him if he makes a lot of money from OpenAI, allowing Altman to give an aw-shucks answer that he is only “paid enough for health insurance” and is motivated purely because he loves the work. (No mention of the five racecars Altman claims to own, including two MacLarens, as well as the “guns, gold . . . and a big patch of land in Big Sur I can fly to” he boasted of to the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/10/sam-altmans-manifest-destiny" target="_blank"><em>New Yorker</em></a> – let alone his ongoing attempt, worthy of a Bond villain, to scan the iris of every person on earth with a metal orb, in exchange for some cryptocurrency he invented. I’m <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/06/1048981/worldcoin-cryptocurrency-biometrics-web3/" target="_blank">not making this up</a>.)</p>

<center><img src="https://creativegood.com/blog/23/worldcoin-orb.jpg"></center><p>
(Above, Altman’s iris-scanning metal orb. It’s already been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/12/hackers-stole-passwords-of-worldcoin-orb-operators/" target="_blank">hacked with malware</a>, of course.)</p>

<p>Anyway, Altman’s comment that caught my eye came elsewhere in his publicity tour, in which he said the following, per <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/05/15/dystopian-future-of-menial-work-ai-replaces-humans/" target="_blank">The Telegraph</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Customer service is one category where I expect a lot of these jobs, honestly, to just go away.</p></blockquote>

<p>In other words, ChatGPT and other generative-AI chat bots will replace call centers in places like the Philippines and India – since the natural-language processing will be able to service customer requests without any pesky humans getting in the way of those sweet, sweet corporate profit margins. (For more, read Noami Klein’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/08/ai-machines-hallucinating-naomi-klein" target="_blank">recent column</a>, which I quoted at length <a href="https://creativegood.com/blog/23/the-giant-brain-suck.html" target="_blank">last week</a>.)</p>

<p><b>The problem with chat bots</b></p>

<p>The corporate case for automating customer service, bringing about those attractive financial outcomes, says nothing about the customers themselves. As I wrote in <a href="https://creativegood.com/blog/23/where-are-the-customers-chats.html" target="_blank">Where are the customers’ chats?</a> (Feb 24, 2023):</p>

<blockquote><p>In all of the ChatGPT coverage, I haven’t seen why this is a good idea for <em>customers</em>: I mean the users, patients, students, citizens, consumers, and all others who are on the receiving end of this technology. We’ve heard about all of the handsome profits available to the Big Tech giants, and AI startups, for adopting and promoting AI chat technology. But that leaves an obvious question. If you’ll excuse a bit of wordplay, I’d like to ask: <em>Where are the customers’ chats?</em></p>

<p>I’m serious. Everything in the hype around ChatGPT seems to center on what this means for corporations: “think of the margins, no more need to pay for researchers, writers, or editors!” Or, for articles taking the flip side: “time to freak out if you’re a researcher, writer, or editor!” All of which may be valid, but the discussion is limited to how the tools will change life inside the corporation (fatter bonuses for execs, more pink slips for employees). No one mentions the customers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Someone <em>did</em> mention the customers recently, and that was Dave Mandl and me in our conversation on the <a href="https://www.wfmu.org/playlists/shows/127244" target="_blank">May 1, 2023 Techtonic</a>, agreeing that replacing humans with chat bots is the <em>last</em> thing customers want, when they’re in a situation that requires customer service.</p>

<p>A chat bot can handle expected, middle-of-the-road queries (as in, for a bank, “what’s my balance” and so on) – but customers can get those answers already from the app or website.</p>

<p>Instead, the reason people go to customer service is because of a question that’s so specific, or complicated, or gnarly in some respect, that there’s no way the app will have the answer: you need a <em>human</em>. For example, as Dave and I <a href="https://wfmu.org/archiveplayer/?show=127244&amp;archive=234605&amp;starttime=0:19:57" target="_blank">discussed</a>: “Hey, my credit card isn’t working, and maybe it’s because of a weird charge I had on it yesterday, but then something else happened right before this purchase” – that’s the sort of complicated scenario that you don’t want to go to a chat bot for. You want a human for customer service.</p>

<p>Customers want humans in these situations, but Sam Altman says that he expects customer service to “honestly just go away” – to be replaced by his own platform, of course. <b>The tech industry continues to push forward with chat bots, even though customers don’t want them</b> – at least for customer service, the venue for problems that the regular website or app can’t handle. The tech industry’s push for profit-over-customers fits with Cory Doctorow’s argument in <em>Chokepoint Capitalism</em> about the gradual but inevitable decline of UX as platforms become more financialized (see more in my <a href="https://www.wfmu.org/playlists/shows/125826" target="_blank">interview with Cory</a> on the March 20, 2023 Techtonic).</p>

<article>
    
  </article>

<p>Along the same lines, <a href="https://ez.substack.com/p/artificial-labor" target="_blank">Artificial Labor</a> by Ed Zitron (May 12, 2023) discusses the very real possibility of chat bots replacing customer service:</p>

<blockquote><p>one might think this is impossible – that multi-billion dollar corporations could not simply remove all customer service – until you consider how companies like Twitter, Facebook and Uber have all but removed customer service.</p>

<p>. . . While I’m not suggesting that <em>every</em> company will follow this model, this feels like an inevitable consequence of artificial intelligence adoption. Companies may believe (at least, superficially) that the consumer is “important,” but they also hate the idea that their enterprise is somehow responsible for the product that they provide to them.</p>

<p>. . . An AI agent can mimic the abilities of a customer service agent without having any of the responsibility or empathy. A customer can still be “helped,” but not in any way that gives them progress or influence over the organization – they are trapped in an autonomous world where the rules are entirely set by the company.</p>

<p>While a human being might get involved, those person-to-person interactions will become increasingly rare, and as a result distance the company from any customer responsibility.</p></blockquote>

<p>I’m with Zitron, and Doctorow, and for that matter my old friend Douglas Rushkoff, who got a well-deserved <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doug-rushkoff-survival-of-the-richest/" target="_blank">profile in Wired</a> last week. The tech companies have too much money and power, and they’re using it to push “innovations” on us that pump up short-term financial gains while trashing the user experience. Customers don’t want the chat bots, just like they don’t want their irises scanned by a metal orb in exchange for some fraud-friendly funny money from the chief disruptor tech bro.</p>

<p>The only, and I mean <em>the only</em>, good use I’ve seen for chat bots in customer service is <a href="https://twitter.com/jbrowder1/status/1657089336423112796" target="_blank">this example</a> from Joshua Browder, in which he deployed a chat bot to cancel his New York Times subscription, which required dealing with customer service just to cancel. In the screenshot below, “You” is Joshua’s chat bot, giving chat botty answers to “francis,” who very well may be a bot, or a person using a bot, to give canned responses.</p>

<p>There has to be a better way. Here we are building chat bots that some customers will use to fight other chat bots from corporations. Why not – and I know this is radical – why not build technology that customers actually <em>want</em>, that customers can actually <em>benefit</em> from, that customers would actually <em>appreciate</em>?</p>

<p>In other words: why are we building technology to enable, or defend against, bad experiences – when we could build good experiences instead?</p>

<p>Until next time,</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><a href="https://www.fabricatedknowledge.com/about" rel="">Doug O’Laughlin</a><span> is the author of </span><a href="https://www.fabricatedknowledge.com/" rel="">Fabricated Knowledge</a><span> and has been writing about the interaction between semiconductors and the AI revolution for years. In this interview, we focus on Nvidia — how it rose to prominence, its importance to the large language model revolution, and the corporate and policy implications of its trillion-dollar valuation. Do note we recorded this episode before the latest reporting around </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-28/us-plans-new-ai-computer-chip-export-controls-aimed-at-nvidia" rel="">possible enhanced chip controls</a><span> and </span><a href="https://interconnected.blog/us-vs-china-a-cloud-proxy-war/?utm_content=buffer5b3c5&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer" rel="">cloud compute</a><span> restrictions. </span></p><p>In the conversation below, we cover:</p><ul><li><p>Nvidia’s origin in the graphics card industry, and CEO Jensen Huang’s creation of a GPU ecosystem, which set up Nvidia to become a dominant player;</p></li><li><p>How the rise of transformer models in AI benefited from Nvidia’s compute and software ecosystem, allowing for larger, more scalable models;</p></li><li><p>The absence (for now) of foreign and domestic competitors for Nvidia, especially in China;</p></li><li><p>What US export controls on Chinese hardware mean for US-China AI competition; and</p></li><li><p>The limits and opportunities that accompany China’s potential access to foreign cloud services. </p></li></ul><p><strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong><span> Let’s start with </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang" rel="">Jensen Huang</a><span>, who was born in Taiwan, moved to the US in 1967 at the age of four, and later decides he wants to do computer graphics. Take us from there. Doug, what are the deep origins of Nvidia?</span></p><p><strong>Doug O’Laughlin:</strong><span> Nvidia was truly a fly-by-night thing. They knew they wanted to do graphics cards. There were a few other competitors. The company’s first name had its origin in “NV” or “next version,” the name they gave to all their files. At some point, they had to incorporate and said, “We’re going to do ‘Nvidia’ for the Latin word for ‘envy.’”&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>They were always just focused on the next chips.</strong><span> The first chip they made is </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NV1" rel="">NV1</a><span> in 1995. That chip was just a low-level card for the graphics market. This was when the industry was starting to add graphical user interfaces to computers. They partnered with what is now </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STMicroelectronics" rel="">STMicroelectronics</a><span> to launch their first chip. It was okay.&nbsp;Then they launched their second chip, which was a little better. They skirted bankruptcy. </span></p><p><span>At this point, they’re duking it out with </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Graphics" rel="">Silicon Graphics</a><span>, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3dfx_Interactive" rel="">3dfx Interactive</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S3_Graphics" rel="">S3 Graphics</a><span>. There are a lot of other companies, but they don’t matter because Nvidia and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATI_Technologies" rel="">ATI Technologies</a><span> — which later is acquired by </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD" rel="">AMD</a><span> — are the only two companies that make it through this intense period. There were tons of graphics cards, and Nvidia was the winner of them all.</span></p><p><strong>Around the period of 2000 to 2002, Nvidia becomes the stalwart.</strong><span> It has an amazing series of products and takes a lot of share, usually at the high end of the market. </span></p><p>That is the story of the beginning of Nvidia. It went from a tiny, fledgling, fab-less chip company to making new products and eventually winning its place market share. They became dominant and have held that position in gaming ever since.</p><p><strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong><span> Nvidia is the king of computer gaming. But that wasn’t enough for the company’s leadership, it seems. How did they take the firm to the next level?</span></p><p><strong>Doug O’Laughlin:</strong><span> Jensen has always been very vocal about accelerated compute. There’s an important shift here. I want to explain the difference between </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing" rel="">parallel computing</a><span> and the rest of computing.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86" rel="">X86</a><span> is one of the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit" rel="">CPUs</a><span> that you’re familiar with. It fetches instructions, does a job, and puts it back. They do that very quickly. GPUs, however, are specifically meant for rendering every single pixel on your screen. Each pixel, color, and location is a parallel problem.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Let’s take 1080p. There are thousands of pixels, and each pixel needs to know how to move and how to change. You can’t just do this with the CPU because it would try to calculate each individual pixel. You need a machine that is extremely wide and parallel so that it can do all these little computations at the same time. That’s how you get a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface" rel="">graphic user interface</a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Those three pixels, shaders, or calculating triangles are best done by matrix multiplication, which is important for AI. The type of calculation that GPUs were meant for — the graphics processing for the highly parallel calculation of all the pixels — ends up being almost a perfect use case for the primary, heaviest part of AI computing.</p><p><strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong><span> Is it just happenstance that the GPUs that render </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yR3Ftt07mDQ" rel="">Tribes II</a><span> are the same ones the deep learning revolution requires? Or is something more fundamental going on?</span></p><p><strong>Doug O’Laughlin:</strong><span> I would say it’s a mix of both. The type of processor ends up being well-suited for gaming. This market has a need that Nvidia can fulfill in the near term, and it can make money the entire way.

It has to be split into small pieces and then fed into the machine parallel.</p><p><span>There’s something called </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA" rel="">CUDA</a><span>, which is software that makes code more parallel so you can put it into the GPU.</span></p><p>He started giving it away for free as much as he could to all the researchers by maybe as early as 2010. He would just give away GPUs and CUDA and make sure all the researchers were working and using GPUs. That way, they would only know how to do their problems on GPUs while optimizing their physics libraries on GPUs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jensen had his eye on the ball and knew he was creating an ecosystem and making his product the one to use</strong><span>. He gives it away for free so everyone knows how to use it. Then everyone uses it in their workflows and optimizes around it.</span></p><p>He does this for about a decade. Jensen the whole time looks at these problems and knows these super-massive multiplication problems are the future of big data.&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t think that would have been a spicy opinion in the 2010s — that matrix multiplication would be used for very large data sets and hard, complicated problems; that’s not a big leap. But pursuing that path, seeing that vision, and creating the ecosystem around it — giving away a lot of it for free — is how Jensen locked in that ecosystem ten years ago.</p><p><strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong><span> How does the revolution in </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)" rel="">transformers</a><span> connect to the compute and software ecosystem Nvidia built?</span></p><p><strong>Doug O’Laughlin:</strong><span> Transformers are a specific type of AI model. Each transformer takes a lot of data — say, a phrase or sentence used by a large language model — and puts all the information each word has into a transformer cell.</span></p><p><span>Transformers don’t perform as well as neural networks do at a small size. (</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network" rel="">Recurrent neural networks</a><span> and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network" rel="">convolutional neural networks</a><span> are two examples, and there are other types of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network" rel="">neural networks</a><span>.) </span></p><p>These transformers are the tiny, single blocks of compute that make these models possible.&nbsp;Training and teaching the transformer cell is a guess-and-check process. The computer guesses the outcome, and you check against the actuals. Then it just does this over and over again until it has guessed and checked everything it could within a data set. By doing this, we learn all the relationships.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Now we could take these relationships, and whenever you feed us new information, we can use what we’ve learned from all the information that’s been fed to us and give you a result. That’s the transformer</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model" rel=""> LLM</a><span> breakdown. It’s guessing and checking, and lots and lots of compute.</span></p><p><strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong><span> Nvidia has two lines of revenue: gaming and data centers. How has the past quarter answered some questions about Nvidia’s long-term importance?</span></p><p><strong>Doug O’Laughlin</strong><span>: </span><a href="https://www.chinatalk.media/p/gpt-4-ai-unleashed" rel="">ChatGPT</a><span> has become a viral and meaningful product. It has millions of users, though its market penetration is still a small percentage of the total.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This AI thing has been happening for a while now. GPT-3 was good. And as you know, if you use the 3.5, it’s a very good model. But we finally hit the tipping point of it becoming a true consumer product. Once people started to consume it, they started to realize its potential. </span><strong>To be clear, it’s still very immature. But one of the things that’s important about this whole story is that we have a roadmap for AI to get better, which is rare.</strong></p><p>Transformer models improve as they get larger. Researchers have been making them larger, and they’ve been improving. We’re now at the point where we need new GPUs so we can make larger models that we know are going to be better. That’s how we’re going to improve.</p><p><span>The biggest problem — the big-ticket item — for anyone to enter the game is having a lot of GPUs. For example, there’s a private, VC-backed company called </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic" rel="">Anthropic</a><span>, and they just raised billions of dollars. They’re going to spend billions of dollars on GPUs.</span></p><p>Let’s compare AI workloads to traditional workloads. A traditional workload, like hosting a website, requires loading the website, then the website pings a web server, and then the web server tells you all the responses. These are really easy problems in terms of compute.</p><p><span>But if you look at AI, it’s totally different. Let’s say you ask AI a question. It runs your thirty-word sentence into its model. Its model has billions of parameters showing the relationships between all these words. </span><strong>Each time you run a ChatGPT query, it costs cents. That doesn’t sound like a lot, but in terms of compute, Googling doesn’t round to a cent</strong><span>. The big difference is that AI is way more compute-intensive. Not only is it compute-intensive, but we know it gets better with even more computing.</span></p><p><strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong><span> Who else needs the type of compute Nvidia is selling?</span></p><p><strong>Doug O’Laughlin:</strong><span> The big ones are Microsoft and </span><a href="https://www.chinatalk.media/p/openai-how-did-they-do-it-lessons" rel="">OpenAI</a><span>. There are also a lot of enterprises starting to put real dollars behind this. Salesforce says it will</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/12/salesforce-launches-ai-cloud-to-bring-models-to-the-enterprise/" rel=""> add AI</a><span> to all our workloads. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ServiceNow" rel="">ServiceNow</a><span> is </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/ai-robotics/servicenow-artificial-intelligence-enterprise-startups-investment/" rel="">investing in AI</a><span> as well. Enterprises are starting to meaningfully move forward.</span></p><p><span>Bloomberg made </span><a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2023/05/31/ai-chatbot-speaks-finance/" rel="">BloombergGPT</a><span>, which is trained on financial data. It’s much smaller than OpenAI’s ChatGPT, but it’s better at finance because of that specialization. Everyone wants to bring their own data sets and make their own models built on their proprietary data set, which they believe will outperform publicly available competitors.</span></p><p>Nvidia even sells a managed service to train customer models. Meta is a good example. Right now most of the core investing is coming from big companies at the top trying to create solutions that can be scaled and sold to other companies and individuals. No one knows where the limits of improvement end.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Right now OpenAI is clearly in the lead. But it’s so dynamic that their lead is not guaranteed. So everyone has to invest in it</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>Sam Altman said something insane. To make OpenAI viable, they need at least </span><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-losses-doubled-to-540-million-as-it-developed-chatgpt" rel="">$100 billion</a><span>. That’s crazy, right? But we know that the models get better if we make them bigger. So the only way we can make them bigger is if we buy a lot more GPUs.</span></p><p><strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong><span> Nvidia can charge enormous margins because they’re largely the only game in town. But there are lots of others who have tried to design their own chips. Why are these options not as good as Nvidia’s?</span></p><p><strong>Doug O’Laughlin:</strong><span> There really is only one real competitor, and that’s Google. I just wrote a </span><a href="https://www.fabricatedknowledge.com/p/the-coming-wave-of-ai-and-how-nvidia" rel="">piece about this</a><span>. I talk about the three-headed hydra of Nvidia’s competition.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The order from smallest to largest is software, hardware, and networking. Software is really important. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebras" rel="">Cerebras</a><span> is a hardware competitor.</span></p><p>When these AI accelerator companies started to make hardware, one of the problems every single one of these companies ran into was that they didn’t have the software to support the problem. They had to build it. They had to build a software stack out of the box every single time if they wanted to do a new problem.</p><p>In that view, AI was going to be relatively fixed. People would know what the right answer would be. But the world was so dynamic. Things changed. GPUs are better than CPUs. They are flexible enough to be used for any matrix multiplication problem. A lot of companies made the bet on convolutional neural networks. But then the transformer model came and completely blew them away.</p><p>Networking is another level. These models are becoming so large — you go and buy a $40,000 GPU, but it’s still not going to be enough to train your model. It’ll take years or months to train a model across tens of thousands of GPUs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span>One issue is the </span><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-29746-0_1" rel="">interconnect problem</a><span>. It’s not just how good the software and hardware are — it’s how good the hardware works together in a </span><a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/58198/files/4550808/download?verifier=Qo0nVyKoWYU9tpyvNo3FFYtSn5eJxxLjCWbVJYdL&amp;wrap=1" rel="">big system</a><span>.</span></strong></p><p>The analogy I use is that the pizza is too big to bake in any single oven. For one cohesive model — or pizza — to be finished, you have to cut each pizza into these tiny little slices and each oven is meant to cook just that slice. Then you put them all together into this giant cohesive model.</p><p><span>There is an advantage there called </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NVLink" rel="">NVLink</a><span>, and there’s a lot of software optimization to scale up these models so they are larger than just a single GPU. Nvidia has done a really good job at that. The AI hardware companies haven’t offered a good solution.</span></p><p>Google has been at the forefront of AI research for a long time. They have a lot of the things Nvidia has, but they are custom, in-house, and proprietary. They don’t sell it as a solution.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_Processing_Unit" rel="">TPUs</a><span> are their hardware, and </span><a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/2017/03/xla-tensorflow-compiled.html" rel="">XLA</a><span> is their software. They have their own </span><a href="https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/how-to/cci/oci/connectivity-overview" rel="">OCI networking product</a><span> with the models on top of it.</span></p><p><strong>Google right now is probably the closest real competitor that has a complete vertical full stack. </strong><span>Nvidia doesn’t have a full vertical stack because they’re not customer-facing and they don’t make the models. They make some open-source models. They improve the entire ecosystem. But they’re essentially AI as a service, and they’re trying to sell it to people who are making the models.</span></p><p><strong>Google is trying to own the entire stack — consumer to model to hardware to networking — and sell it. So far, Google has truly the most competitive, differentiated offering relative to Nvidia. But no one else has made the solutions that Nvidia does.</strong></p><p>There’s a big difference between making a theoretical chip that can solve a model and then you have to troubleshoot it — versus Nvidia, where you could buy 10,000 GPUs and it will work out of the box. That’s a big difference.</p><p>Productization — Nvidia has done a really good job at making a product to sell to customers — that’s their big differentiator. The three-headed hydra of Nvidia is hard to compete with.</p><p>We saw the AI hardware companies: they tried to make better hardware, but they couldn’t beat them. They tied them on hardware, but they couldn’t beat them on the software. We’re not even talking about the network fee.</p><p>This is the hard problem.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You have to compete with them on three different fronts, and most companies are lucky to be able to compete with them on one</strong><span>.</span></p><p><strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong><span> In October 2022, the US Department of Commerce enacted </span><a href="https://www.chinatalk.media/p/new-chip-export-controls-explained" rel="">export controls</a><span> designed to stop PRC-based data centers from acquiring the kind of full-stack compute Nvidia provides. What are the implications of there being no Chinese firms that can compete with foreign compute offerings?</span></p><p><strong>Doug O’Laughlin:</strong><span> Maybe the only company I’ve heard of is </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biren_Technology" rel="">Biren</a><span>, the GPU company. But that product is super behind.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>One of the benefits is that the US seems to be ahead in the innovation game. Also, China has a GPT </span><a href="https://www.chinatalk.media/p/chinas-censors-are-afraid-of-what" rel="">censorship problem</a><span>.</span></p><p><strong>On top of that, they can’t really design the chips. </strong><span>Some aspects of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_design_automation" rel="">EDA </a><span>have been turned off for them. And we limited the networking aspect of it. Nvidia can sell chips to China, and they do. They probably sell millions and billions of dollars worth of </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-tweaks-flagship-h100-chip-export-china-h800-2023-03-21/" rel="">H800</a><span> — essentially a limited version of the H100 with a much worse net worth. The specs are kind of similar. It’s probably like a slower bin or something like that.</span></p><p><span>The Bureau of Industry and Security was thoughtful and said the US can give them as much hardware or as many chips as they want — but </span><strong>China can’t scale up to make these ginormous models if they don’t have the networking</strong><span>. That’s how the United States has hampered and cut off the ability of China to be even in the race.&nbsp;</span></p><p>I’m sure there are domestic companies that are trying to get around this problem because the chips are the same. I’m sure there’s some way to improve the networking and be able to scale it out in an even bigger, better way. It's just not going to be what is available off the chip today.</p><p><strong>It’s hard for me to imagine China competing on these large language models because they have their hands tied behind their backs. They can’t scale up to this huge amount. </strong><span>Maybe they could scale up with even more H800s, but it would cost some ridiculous number that is truly mind-boggling. That’s just in the race to buy Nvidia GPUs.</span></p><p><strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong><span> Chinese firms, however, are not restricted in accessing cloud services overseas. Nothing is stopping a Chinese company from buying top-of-the-line Nvidia compute from AWS. Does that alter the dynamic?</span></p><p><strong>Doug O’Laughlin:</strong><span> For these companies, it matters quite a bit. It’s kind of relegated China to being a consumer, a purchaser. They can only buy the IP, but they can never own it.</span></p><p><strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong><span> So Chinese firms can’t compete on hardware, but they could train their models on cloud services and then compete with Western firms? They might spend pennies on compute hoping to get dollars of revenue back.</span></p><p><strong>Doug O’Laughlin:</strong><span> Maybe hopefully they can spend pennies to get dollars. But realistically, if I had to guess, they’re going to be spending pennies to make $0.50. It’s going to come in at a lot lower margins than it used to. That’s a big deal.</span></p><p>But if China and the US are in an ideological trade war, why bother at all? It seems that we’re closer to that, so why bother. We have cut off the future of humanity.</p><p><strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong><span> This undermines Jensen’s claim that if we don’t let Chinese firms buy semiconductors, we’re going to fall behind. Chinese firms might still access compute, but instead of housing it in </span><a href="https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/chinas-netease-breaks-ground-on-data-center-in-guizhou-province/" rel="">Guizhou</a><span>, they’re just getting it from server farms in Seattle or Singapore.</span></p><p>Is the US comfortable with Chinese firms having relatively unfettered access to these hardware stacks, but just outside of the territory of the PRC?</p><p><strong>Doug O’Laughlin:</strong><span> The important part of this whole thing is latency. They can use ChatGPT, but the raw latency is going to be a lot slower than in the United States. We get to use it at a speed of about sixty milliseconds per response. For them, it might be one to two seconds. Some consumers will be able to eat that.</span></p><p><strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong><span> Hopefully AWS knows what’s going on in their servers enough to stop a </span><a href="https://mitchellaerospacepower.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/MI_Forum_47-Chinese-Airfields-Final.pdf" rel="">Chinese drone swarm</a><span> from invading Taiwan while relying on cloud compute in Singapore.</span></p><p><strong>Doug O’Laughlin:</strong><span> I would think they’re aware enough. But on top of that, the closer compute cluster is going to win because one’s going to be faster than the other. If you have to lease it, it’s a physical problem. If they’re renting AI models in Virginia or North Carolina, wherever the giant server farm is, that’s going to be a 600-millisecond latency versus running it locally in Taiwan. The faster one will win.</span></p><p><strong>Jordan Schneider:</strong><span> The dream is to have advanced computing directly on your PC or iPhone rather than having to access it via the cloud. Is this sort of thing a threat to Nvidia’s future?</span></p><p><strong>Our conversation continues with a discussion of </strong></p><ul><li><p>The impact of on-device inference on Nvidia’s future</p></li><li><p>Lessons for founders and policymakers from Jensen Huang’s arc</p></li><li><p>How Nvidia’s future is intertwined with TSMC’s</p></li></ul></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Missing a connection can turn a routine trip into a real slog.</p>



<p>There’s good news, though. Airlines who operate flights from/within Europe (or from anywhere on an EU carrier) are required by law to get you to your final destination within a specific timeframe. If they don’t, you’re entitled to a good amount of cash thanks to the EU 261/2004 legislation. Outside of the EU; countries like Brazil, Canada, and the UK all have similar laws. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, there is nothing stopping an airline from denying a legit claim. They know you wont chase them down in courts, and there’s no automatic oversight.</p>

<h2>Preface</h2>



<p>Airlines are so focused on their bottom line that they will outright lie to passengers, denying totally valid compensation claims. They do this by giving affected passengers incorrect departure/arrival information, or worse, blaming Air Traffic Control, in an attempt to shift focus and avoid payout. (Non-EU-based airlines will straight up ignore EU261/2004 requests!)</p>



<p>“It was an air traffic control delay” is a convincing excuse, but generally not a valid one. Under the law, burden of proof is on the airline.</p>



<p>Air France played dirty with me recently—and now <em>you</em> get to read about it! Let this article serve as a tutorial on how to handle an airline dispute on your own. Take note of which proof to keep, which laws mean what, and how to word emails. </p>



<h2>The Incident</h2>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="520" height="210" src="https://airdisputes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chart.png" alt="" srcset="https://airdisputes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chart.png 520w, https://airdisputes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Chart-300x121.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px"><figcaption><sup><em><sub>Original schedule (booking e-mail)</sub></em></sup> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The first leg of the itinerary was AF1225, a quick shot from LIS to CDG on Air France.</p>



<p>Everything started normally, with a smooth check-in around 08:00 and a departure time of 09:40 posted on the departures screens. As long as everything went to schedule, I would arrive in Miami at 18:05 (EST). </p>



<p>My itinerary allowed for just an hour to disembark the first segment, go through immigration in Paris, then board the international segment. The connection was going to be tight—doable, but tight. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, things went south.</p>



<p>Right off the bat, the arrival plane (F-GTAY) from Paris (AF1224) was delayed into Lisbon by about ten minutes, arriving at the gate at 09:00. This gave Air France just 40 minutes to disembark all the passengers, clean, and off/load all the hold luggage. </p>

<p>The gate agents made an announcement of a short delay due to a “late incoming aircraft,” and put a new departure time up of 09:56. Once the plane was ready, we were quickly boarded and things seemed to be back on track.</p>



<p>Then we waited. </p>



<p>And waited. </p>



<p>At one point, I checked FlightAware, which said the plane had already taken off. The aircraft hadn’t even left the gate.</p>

<p>By the time the flight left the gate at 10:48, it was clear there was going to be no time to make the connection. This was confirmed by a flight attendant, who told me during the flight to proceed directly to the customer service booth once we arrived at CDG.</p>



<p>The flight landed at 13:55, and it wasn’t until about 14:20 that all passengers (including myself) were fully unloaded. It took about ten more minutes to get myself to the customer service booth. </p>

<h2>Customer Service</h2>



<p>The AF customer service agents at Charles de Gaulle were helpful enough. I was ultimately rebooked on AF686 to Atlanta, and then on DL1399 to Miami. My new ETA: 00:53(+1 day)—roughly 6 hours after my original scheduled landing time, triggering Article 6(1)(c) and Article 7(1)(c) of EU 261/2004.</p>



<p>At one point I asked about my right to compensation, but they would not provide any information related to EU 261/2004. This could be considered a violation of Article 251 (20) of the original treaty: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>(20) Passengers should be fully informed of their rights in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights, so that they can effectively exercise their rights.  </p>
<cite>https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX%3A32004R0261</cite></blockquote>



<p>“I don’t know anything about that law,” I was told. “You’ll have to call.” Instead, I was handed an €11 voucher for food (which buys nothing at CDG, by the way).</p>



<h2>The Claim</h2>



<p>Within the next 30 minutes, I had a claim filed through Air France’s <a href="https://wwws.airfrance.fr/en/information/legal/reclamation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online form</a>. This is a really simple form that just requires photos of your boarding pass, flight details, an explanation for the claim, and bank information. The entire process from submission to decision should take roughly a week. </p>



<p>For the record, the rest of my flights were also delayed, getting me into Miami at 02:15 (+1 day) and making the total delay about eight hours.</p>



<p>Within ten days I got a response from Air France: <strong>denied</strong>.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="618" height="607" src="https://airdisputes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/First.png" alt="" srcset="https://airdisputes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/First.png 618w, https://airdisputes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/First-300x295.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px"><figcaption><em><sup>First Denial (for a flight from Israel?)</sup></em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Blaming ATC and weather are common “get-out-of-jail-free cards” airlines use—mostly because it’s initially hard to prove wrong. Most people don’t think an airline would lie to them. I responded to the denial asking for clarification before I escalated.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="607" height="514" src="https://airdisputes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Second.png" alt="" srcset="https://airdisputes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Second.png 607w, https://airdisputes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Second-300x254.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 607px) 100vw, 607px"><figcaption><em><sup>Second Denial</sup></em></figcaption></figure></div>


<h2>Escalation</h2>



<p>Rule of thumb: never trust a company that owes you money to fairly investigate themselves. Once I realized Air France was sticking to the script, I informed them I plan on escalating to the Portuguese Civil Aviation Authority (also known as <a href="https://www.anac.pt/vPT/Generico/Paginas/Homepage00.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ANAC</a>). </p>



<p>In Europe, each country has a Civil Aviation Authority that is responsible for enforcing EU 261/2004. To escalate a claim, fill out a complaint form and send all the requested documents to the Civil Aviation Authority in the departure country — in my case Portugal. You may have to write the email in the local language, however ANAC has an English contact. It can take up to 30 days to receive a response.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://airdisputes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CAA.png" alt="" width="612" height="506" srcset="https://airdisputes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CAA.png 726w, https://airdisputes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CAA-300x248.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px"></figure></div>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Lucky for me, it took just five days for ANAC to come back with a response: <strong>OVERRULED!</strong></p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://airdisputes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CAA2.png" alt="" width="654" height="529" srcset="https://airdisputes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CAA2.png 825w, https://airdisputes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CAA2-300x243.png 300w, https://airdisputes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CAA2-768x621.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px"></figure></div>


<p>Just to be clear: ANAC requested clarification from Air France, and instead of blaming weather or ATC, AF simply rolled over without challenge. Why? Because the burden of proof falls on the airline and they were presumably lying to me. </p>



<p>Instead of reopening my original claim, Air France opened a brand new claim. I was ultimately paid out $658. </p>

<h2>Aftermath</h2>



<p>As you can see, Airlines have no trouble hiding the truth from customers. The way to handle it is with confidence and persistance.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/sci-scripts">https://www.benshoof.org/blog/sci-scripts</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36623804">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<p>
					'Round these parts, we write about old Sierra games and their rich inner lives. As I'm often at pains to point out, this is thanks to the brilliant script decompiler written by Phil Fortier for <a href="http://scicompanion.com/">SCI Companion</a>. Released in 2015, it was the first and only decompiler for SCI games — at least as far as the world is concerned. And now lo, for there is another.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Last year, I had a vision and began writing my own decompiler — a <i>mass decompiler</i> — with the goal of wiring it up to my script tools for annotations. Annotations are comments and symbols that transform decompiled code from something you <i>can</i> read into something you want to. That's how I learned the scripts in the first place: by writing automatic annotators and reading the results. I&nbsp;wanted to share this with the community<a href="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/community">*</a> but the particulars of SCI Companion made it a thorny problem. The decompiler I envisioned could unlock the solution, but I didn't know how to write it. I wasn't sure I ever would. The only certainty was that win or lose, it would take a while.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					In the meantime, I slowly obtained as many games and variants as I could. What's a mass decompiler without the masses? There are only about sixty games, but they were heavily revised, ported, and translated. Software scavenger hunts are fun and this one as been successful. I've now amassed over three hundred versions of SCI games from 1988 through 1996. While that's not <i>every</i> single one, you have my permission to say it is.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Today, with one command and a couple of cores, I've decompiled and annotated every Sierra SCI game, and <i>practically</i> every version, and dumped the results on github for everyone to enjoy. <b>Gentlemen...&nbsp;<i>BEHOLD!</i></b>
					</p>
			
					<p>

					<a href="https://github.com/sluicebox/sci-scripts">https://github.com/sluicebox/sci-scripts</a>
					</p>
			
					<p>
					<i>You're still here??</i> Look, you're welcome to stay, but I just linked to half a gig of <b>way</b> more interesting text. I even got out the big font! (When do we <i>ever</i> get out the big font?) In fact, I'm counting on the crowd thinning out so I can indulge in some inside baseball.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					I just want to kick back and tell the story of how this came to be. We'll see where Sierra's script language came from, what reverse engineers have done with it, and why I'm cheerfully undermining the blog with today's release. I've got <i>a lot</i> of meta-rules to break. You go outside and play with your scripts!
					</p>
			
					<p>
					When I talk about Sierra code, I break it into three categories:
					</p>
			
					<ul>
					<li><p>
					<b>Game Scripts:</b> This is the unique code that defines a game. Every room in every game gets its own script. You care about this if you want to solve <a href="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/super-sleuth">murder mysteries</a> or find <a href="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/gabriel-knight-1-easter-eggs">easter eggs</a>. This is probably the only code you care about.
					</p></li>
					<li><p>
					<b>System Scripts:</b> These are the supporting scripts that appear in every game. They form a common runtime library that the games are built on. You'll find generic classes for rooms and actors and icon bars, and utility functions for things like message boxes and math. Even the game loop lives here. As you get deeper into SCI mechanics, you care more about these scripts, although perhaps reluctantly.
					</p></li>
					<li><p>
					<b>The Interpreter:</b> This is the program that runs the show; you know it as SIERRA.EXE or SCIV.EXE. The interpreter was written in C and a lot of assembly, and then rewritten in C++ and slightly less assembly. It loads drivers, decodes resources, and runs the first game script in a virtual machine. It's the "VM" in <a href="https://www.scummvm.org/">ScummVM</a>. From there, it just follows orders until a script sets the quit flag or it famously crashes. It also contains over a hundred kernel functions that scripts call to do work. You care about the interpreter if you want to solve <a href="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/case-cracked">bonus mysteries</a> or find <a href="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/sierras-macintosh-timebomb">timebombs</a>. Or if you're <a href="https://www.scummvm.org/credits/#engine_teams">crazy enough</a> to replace the whole thing.
					</p></li>
					</ul>
			
					<p>
					Today is all about the scripts. Let's see what one looks like! Remember that Sierra programmers wrote these in their proprietary language (also called Script) and compiled them with their in-house compiler to SCI bytecode. Those are the bytes that shipped with the games. Decompiling can <i>never</i> recover the original text. Symbols are lost. Control flow is ambiguous. Compilers have bugs. Optimizations ruin everything.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					But God is alive, and Magic is afoot.

					<p>
					This is the code that runs when you click the mint dish in King's Quest VI. And thanks to the annotations, you know what it does. Each comment was generated by an annotator. The message annotator is usually the most helpful. Without the comments, you're just staring at numbers. The global variables were renamed by two annotators: one that handles system globals and another that knows KQ6 details. As you can see in the first version, some symbols come straight from the game. Sierra generously included them for debugging. Combine those names with annotations and you get highly readable code.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Annotations aside, scope out that language. SCI Script is often described as LISP-like, but that's just a curvy stereotype. It <i>looks</i> like LISP because of parenthesis and prefix notation, but if that's all it takes... well please tell that to a LISP programmer. They deserve it. This language doesn't even have LISts! The syntax does make it easy to parse, but I haven't seen anyone take advantage of that; except compiler authors and me. So join the rest of the world and forget about LISP. The real inspiration for SCI Script is Smalltalk.

Two years ago, the <i>Video Game Newsroom Time Machine</i> scored a two hour <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3s0nW1FBN8">interview</a> about his life and career, and he recounted his influences:
					</p>
			
					<blockquote>
						<p>
						Somewhere in there, BYTE Magazine came out with their Smalltalk issue and I discovered object oriented programming, and you know, I read that issue cover to cover I think, and sometimes multiple times maybe. [...]
						</p>
			
						<p>
						In any case I started learning about object oriented programming and it just really resonated with me. And then suddenly we were able to start displaying more than 16 colors on monitors, and Ken wanted of course to take advantage of that, but AGI was written in such a way that it was going to take a major rework of the entire game engine and language and everything in order to support 256 colors. And so that's when I pitched Ken on SCI and basically saying okay let's go with a whole new language, we're going to have to rewrite this thing anyway, let's make things better. And he was pretty dubious, but I guess he figured since we were having to rewrite everything anyway, he might as well let me do it.
						</p>
			
						
					</blockquote>
			
					<p>
					BYTE Magazine dedicated one issue to a language each year. In August 1981, that was Smalltalk. Reading through, I was first struck by the magazine cover. Oh... it has a back story. It's a charming retort to the <a href="https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1978-08">Pascal cover</a> from 1978 that painted Smalltalk as aloof and inaccessible. I love it; did that allegorical slight really fester at Xerox PARC for three years? Of course it did! <i>They're nerds!</i> And&nbsp;their response? A textbook <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/clapback-meaning-origin">clapback</a> from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNTARSM-Fjc&amp;list=PL10CF667591857A2D">Yacht Rock</a> era.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Reading further, I was surprised by how much terminology made its way into SCI: selectors, method dictionaries, temporary variables, receivers — they're all in those pages. Even SCI's ubiquitous <i>doit</i> method is a Smalltalk convention. The influence is clear.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Jeff also mentioned Objective C, and I'm sure that contributed too, but I refused to research it. Sorry, it's a personal prejudice. That&nbsp;language is just so damned ugly that, like a <a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/wildlife/2023/04/14/an-opossums-arrival-in-homer-spurs-capture-efforts-memes-and-a-campaign-to-freegrubby/">filthy</a> <a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/wildlife/2023/05/25/opossum-that-ran-loose-in-homer-for-weeks-finds-a-home-at-the-alaska-zoo/">freakin'</a> <a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/wildlife/2023/06/02/wildlife-officials-seek-help-as-additional-invasive-opossums-are-discovered-in-homer/">opossum</a>, it triggers my fight-or-flight. And I'm done breaking laptops! So we're sticking with the Smalltalk narrative. And breaking meta-rules instead.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					My one exposure to Smalltalk was in school. The assignment was to implement the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine">Enigma cipher</a> in a language you didn't know. For&nbsp;extra credit, you could write a program to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis_of_the_Enigma">crack</a> it. Excuse me? Breaking Nazi encryption is <i>optional??</i> Not in my family! We&nbsp;<b>really</b>&nbsp;need <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anchors-Aweigh-Lynden-Benshoof-ebook/dp/B00AT35E40">Grandpa Benshoof</a> to survive D-Day! Smalltalk did the trick and I remember it fondly. My fascist decoder worked, but as the messages got longer it got slower. Really slow. Even on the expensive machines. Oh well, I wasn't getting graded on speed. Later, the department chair left a handwritten note about my impressive use of CPU cycles. The polite implication was that I would have lost us the war for want of a hash table.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Speaking of impressions! I'm impressed with the shelf life on that Smalltalk issue. SCI was developed in 1988 and yet these technical articles from 1981 were still relevant. In a way, they're timeless. Just not timely.
					</p>
			
					<blockquote>
						<p>
						<b>When Can I Buy It?</b>
						</p>
			
						<p>
						There are currently no personal computer implementations for the Smalltalk-80
						language. Because of this, I'm sure we'll be criticized by some for introducing
						the language too early and frustrating our readers. Nevertheless, I feel that
						the time to begin exposing people to object-oriented language is <i>now</i>. Only by challenging and enticing the personal computer community can we stimulate the industry to create the machines we all dream of.
						</p>
			
						
					</blockquote>
			
					<p>
					Smalltalk fans had the programming language, but not the software. SCI fans had the opposite problem. They had years of games, and years to reverse engineer them, but the source language was a secret. How do you decompile that? What syntax do you use? If&nbsp;SCI Script was internal to Sierra, and the games only contain bytecode, then how do we know what the language looks like at all?
					</p>
			
					<p>
					<b><i>We didn't!</i></b> Not exactly. And not for a long time. But all that's over. Now we know everything.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					<img src="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/images/brief.png" alt="SCI Programming Language document by Jeff Stephenson, 1988">
					</p>
			
					<p>
					To see how far we've come, take a look at this snapshot of Lance Ewing's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110729181959/http://www.scriptinterpreter.com/syntax">SCI Syntax page</a> from 2011. Lance thoroughly documented the publicly available clues to establish what was known and could be inferred about the language. Here In The Future, we have things a bit easier. Here's the original <a href="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/files/sci-programming.language.txt">language spec</a> by Jeff Stephenson himself. This document is a monument to getting things right the first time. Throughout SCI's successful nine year run, the language never changed. The details that drifted are unspeakably dull. The games from 1988 are radically different than 1996, but underneath it's all the same bytecode from the same language. This was a design goal from the start.
					</p>
			
					<blockquote>
						<p>
						The whole goal was flexibility in programming, and trying to push as much of the programming capabilities up to the game developer level rather than having them have to go into the engine as we could, and decoupling graphics and so forth to the point where you could keep extending the graphical capabilities. Because at that point it was pretty clear we're going to be getting more and more changes in hardware and everything.
						</p>
			
						
					</blockquote>
			
					<p>
					To a reverse engineer, this sounds like great news. It sounds like if you want to work with SCI scripts, you can do so universally. And&nbsp;that's true! Kinda? But also not really, because even though the bytecode is consistent, everything else is all over the map.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					When I joined the ScummVM team, Martin Kiewitz told me that the hardest part of SCI was all the versions. Now that ScummVM runs even more of them, I joke that the entire codebase is version checks. The SciVersion <a href="https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/blob/master/engines/sci/detection.h">code</a> is a window into the madness:
					</p>
			
<pre>
<span>enum</span> <span>SciVersion</span> {
	<span>SCI_VERSION_NONE</span>,
	<span>SCI_VERSION_0_EARLY</span>, 
	<span>SCI_VERSION_0_LATE</span>, 
	<span>SCI_VERSION_01</span>, 
	<span>SCI_VERSION_1_EGA_ONLY</span>, 
	<span>SCI_VERSION_1_EARLY</span>, 
	<span>SCI_VERSION_1_MIDDLE</span>, 
	<span>SCI_VERSION_1_LATE</span>, 
	<span>SCI_VERSION_1_1</span>, 
	<span>SCI_VERSION_2</span>, 
	<span>SCI_VERSION_2_1_EARLY</span>, 
	<span>SCI_VERSION_2_1_MIDDLE</span>, 
	<span>SCI_VERSION_2_1_LATE</span>, 
	<span>SCI_VERSION_3</span> 
};
</pre>
			
					<p>
					Depending on your perspective, thirteen versions could be a little, could be a lot. But these aren't <i>real</i> versions; they're high level buckets invented by reverse engineers. Games don't cleanly fall into them. Sierra typically had three or four games in various stages of development. Meanwhile, the interpreter evolved at its own pace. Think of each release as a fork with who knows what fixes and features backported in or taken out or tweaked. Resource formats, container formats, and compression formats each change over time. So apply those fuzzy versions to every layer. And then multiply the combinations across all the patches and ports.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					If you want to write SCI software that works with more than a handful of games then these are your problems to deal with.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					<img src="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/images/kq4-disks.jpg" alt="King's Quest 4 floppy disks">
					<br>
					<i>One of these is a typo that's also a real version</i>
					</p>
			
					<p>
					God help you if you turn to SCI's version numbers. Assuming Sierra didn't typo the floppy labels, or leave the placeholder x.yy.zzz, or release a non-release version, or get the odometer stuck on 2.100.002, then they're best treated as based on a true story. Versions that start with "L.rry" aren't Leisure Suit Larry games; they're whatever Larry Scott compiled that day. Consider that ScummVM is the most comprehensive SCI software and it doesn't even attempt to look at these version numbers.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Instead, each piece is felt out at runtime with careful heuristics, deductive inference, and deep vats of hard-coded exceptions. And&nbsp;then someone finds a German Amiga version full of anachronisms and blows it all up.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Believe it or not, <i>I'm not complaining!</i> If these things were easy then there wouldn't be any left for me.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					But I do want to convince you that <b>Universal SCI is hard</b> and the versions are a heavy tax. We're going to talk about the reverse engineers who took on the scripts, and I want you to know what they were getting into, and appreciate how far they got.

					<p>
					Brian Provinciano is an SCI pioneer. In 1999 he wrote SCI Graphics Studio and set a dangerous precedent with a resource editor for Windows. This grew into SCI Studio, the first program that allowed fans to create their own EGA games. By 2002 it was out of beta and included a script editor, script compiler, and a full template game. SCI Studio was a legitimate Integrated Development Environment — the era of fan games had begun.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					What an exciting time that must have been. And so much work! Sierra's Script was still a secret, so to write a compiler you first had to <i>reinvent the language</i>. At least there were clues to what it should look like. And the bytecode wasn't a total mystery; the names of opcodes and kernel functions were included with games for debugging. Still — <i>sounds hard!</i> Brian took all this and developed his own script syntax with the necessary features that captured the spirit of the original, and then wrote a compiler for it. Sierra's 1980s executables happily ran the results. Nowadays we call this SCI Studio Syntax, but at the time it was the only game in town.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Okay so you have the world's first third party SCI compiler. Now what? Well, Sierra's game programmers didn't start from scratch, they had all those system scripts we discussed earlier. So I guess you need those scripts! But if all you have is bytecode...
					</p>
			
					<blockquote>
						<p>
						I am now working on decompiling Leisure Suit Larry 2 to create the template game. It is TONS of work because my program can only disassemble, not decompile. I am having to do it all by hand. In order to write a decompiler, I would basically have to mimic the interpreter. It would be a lot of work, more work than it's worth.
						</p>
			
						
					</blockquote>
			
					<p>
					Brian later said that he spent weeks on this "long and grueling task" and manually decompiled 50-60 scripts and over 130 classes from several games. If you've never decompiled assembly code by hand then it's hard to explain this sacrifice. And I won't try, because you shouldn't be punished for good life choices. But I will say that once it's done it's done, and <i>is</i> less work than writing a decompiler.

					<i>Brian Provinciano with SCI Studio 3 on TechTV, March 7 2003</i>
					</p>
			
					<p>
					March 2003 was a big month. Brian released SCI Studio 3 and flew from Canada to San Francisco to appear on the TechTV show <i>Call For Help</i> to present it with Sierra fan Aaron Wester. Afterwards, he... sorry can we back up for a sec?
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Let me get this straight... you're saying that in <i>2003</i>... a <i>real</i> television studio recorded a <i>real</i> show about <b><i>SCI fan software?</i></b> And this was broadcast across real satellites to real hotel rooms all over the world? And you want <i>me</i> to believe that <i>U.S. Customs</i> believed all this?? No. Absolutely not! As&nbsp;an SCI nerd in 2023, I can't accept any of this. Nope nope nope. The Wayback Machine must have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030608080619/http://www.bripro.com/news.php">crawled</a> an alternate timeline<a href="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/alternate-timeline">*</a>.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					That same month, Brian announced he was working on supporting VGA games, and had even begun writing a <i>script decompiler</i>. Over the next two years he posted status updates. He even posted entire scripts he'd decompiled from a variety of games.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					And then a hellbeast ate him.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					In 2006 Brian <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060418054504/http://www.bripro.com/scistudio/index.php">retired</a> from SCI and posted his remaining code, but without mentioning the decompiler. He worked on SCI Studio for many years, some while in school, and set the bar for all future tools. His goal was for people to make games and <a href="https://sciprogramming.com/fangames.php">they did</a> and they were <a href="https://sciprogramming.com/fangames.php?action=review&amp;id=32">weird</a> and that is good. ScummVM happily supports fan games so you can still run them today, and probably forever.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					As you can imagine, this left some people disappointed. Not me though. <b><i>I just found out!</i></b> Oh man... so here I am, thinking I'm ushering in the second decompiling, finish the dang thing, do the research for the announcement, and only <i>then</i> find out I've been bumped down to third.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					I'm thrilled that the SCI decompiler story is a trilogy with a lost first volume. Brian's samples and posts are now highly relevant to my interests, so I read them all. Here's the executive summary:
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Brian's decompiler was a standalone program that targeted the full range of SCI versions. The hardest part of decompiling is analyzing control flow, and when the decompiler couldn't figure that out, it generated code with goto statements. That's also what professional programs like IDA Pro and Ghidra do. Goto code isn't very readable, but the alternative is all or nothing. An impressive amount of the samples he posted were right. At one point he said that he was 90% done, but I said the same thing — right before the other 90%. Brian's decompiler was the real deal and on track to do everything.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					<img src="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/images/scicompanion.jpg" alt="SCI Companion">
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Phil Fortier is our SCI savior. In 2007 he released SCI Companion 2 to replace SCI Studio. Phil is an independent <a href="http://www.icefallgames.com/">game developer</a> and one of his motivations was to make his own game. SCI Companion supported Brian's script syntax and the existing fan games. Like SCI Studio, it was limited to EGA games. After a few updates, things quieted down, and then got real quiet.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					<i>Eight years later</i> Phil returned with SCI Companion 3. And it had <a href="https://sciprogramming.com/community/index.php?topic=1420.0">everything</a>! There was support for VGA games, a sound editor, and... AND... an&nbsp;end to the twelve year thirst: the world finally had a script decompiler.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					When I describe SCI reverse engineering, I stress that not only have we been graced with a latter day decompiler — against all odds — but an excellent one. It works so well that there's little to talk about except its limitations.
					</p>
			
					<blockquote>
						<p>
						The decompiler isn't perfect, but typically it can decompile about 95 to 99 percent of a game into source code. Success is typically on a function-by-function basis. Luckily, if an error or unexpected condition occurs anywhere during the decompilation of a function, we can have the entire function fallback to assembly. This at least retains the ability to recompile code correctly, and also retains some symbol information.
						</p>
			
						
					</blockquote>
			
					<p>
					Compare this approach to Brian's goto statements. If just one thing goes wrong then SCI Companion fails a function and produces no code. The larger the function, the more likely it fails. But gotos aren't an option anymore, and for a good reason.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Phil created a new script syntax based on the original and named it Sierra Script. It's so close to Sierra's that I can't remember the differences. I think Phil's is stricter but my parsers can't tell the difference so neither can I. Decompiled scripts look like the real thing, and that's great, and that means no gotos — also great.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					That leaves the bugs where the decompiler silently produces incorrect code. I'm familiar with these because my decompiler stumbled on the same scripts, just louder. Causes include: unexpected optimizations, nonsensical source scripts, and impossible instructions due to compiler bugs. But these instances are so rare that you can pretend they don't exist. So sure, trust but verify, but in practice don't worry about it.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					<img src="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/images/scicompanion-version.png" alt="SCI Companion version dialog">
					</p>
			
					<p>
					The decompiler's biggest limitations aren't in its algorithms, but its ergonomics. It's a complex component in a huge Windows GUI whose primary purpose is to let fans make games. In order to even find the bytecode it has to survive the SCI version nightmare. Phil&nbsp;borrowed the version logic from ScummVM, so it supports most, but he understandably skipped some of the more annoying bits. Some versions fall between these cracks. And the SCI3 script format from the last four games is unsupported. And there's no concept of multiple CDs or Macintosh. If it's outside the mainstream then it's unavailable to the decompiler.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					These are all reasonable priorities for a program that makes fan games. No fan was going to make a seven disc Fantasmagoria. If&nbsp;you want to add support for these extras, you'll have to touch a lot of unfun C++ before you even get to the decompiler. It's been <a href="https://github.com/icefallgames/SCICompanion/">open source</a> for many years so nothing has stopped you, but that brings us to the real limitation...
					</p>
			
					<p>
					SCI Companion is a Microsoft Foundation Classes Win32 C++ codebase that no one wants to work on<a href="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/prove-me-wrong">*</a>. <i>Oh, I get it!</i> Long ago I wrote some of my favorite programs in that stuff, and I still love running them today, but I can't bring myself to look at the code again.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					There are signs of life. The Cat has a <a href="https://github.com/Kawa-oneechan/SCICompanion">fork</a> with some fixes, and Laurence Myers recently added <a href="https://github.com/Kawa-oneechan/SCICompanion/pull/15">automatic builds</a>. That's exciting, but let's not quibble over commits: Phil finished a long time ago and no one else has touched the decompiler. <i>Including me!</i> As&nbsp;you'll see, I don't even know how it works. Maybe today's release will spark some interest. For now, the decompiler is done, and that's okay.
					</p>
			
					<blockquote>
						<p>
						With a bunch more work, it should be possible to have the decompiler 100% effective (except for corrupted scripts, of course) — but I decided that the effort vs reward wasn't worth it beyond this point, especially given the fallback to assembly.
						</p>
			
						
					</blockquote>
			
					<p>
					Phil split SCI reverse engineering into two eras: Before Companion and After Decompiler. Reverse engineering generates countless unknowns that are too impractical to investigate. There's a threshold there, and it's determined by the tools. SCI Companion's decompiler sent that threshold plummeting. I'm hoping that today's release finishes the job.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Think of all the SCI details that were too difficult to figure out before 2015. Turn all the bytecode into high quality text, and people like us can knock them out with one grep. It's fun! It has to be — <i>it's cheating!</i>
					</p>
			
					<p>
					But you can have too much fun, so you have to be careful. Or else you could end up with a hobby.

					<p>
					Here's where I enter the story:
					</p>
			
					<blockquote>
						<p>
						It's important to have goals, or so I'm told by several reputable hashtags. In the 90s mine were to solve The Colonel's Bequest, and more importantly, The Dagger of Amon Ra. It was clear that merely playing them wasn't going to cut it. As&nbsp;time passed I would occasionally check in on the Sierra scene and when SCI Viewer dropped so did my hopes.
						</p>
			
						<p>
						SCI Viewer revealed that there was indeed a lot more to these cases but that the answers were all in the scripts. At the time, this meant reams of intolerably low level disassembly text. This wouldn't do for the high level answers I sought. "I'll&nbsp;come back later." In 2015 it was later, and lo, for Phil Fortier released from the heavens SCI Companion 3.0 with an honest to goodness script decompiler. It had been twenty years but not only could my investigation now proceed, it <i>had</i> to.
						</p>
			
						
					</blockquote>
			
					<p>
					I don't know exactly when I discovered SCI Companion 3, but I remember feeling lucky. It must have been pretty new, because it crashed so much that I couldn't use it. Before giving up, I tried compiling the latest code — the last refuge of a scoundrel. It wouldn't build, some MFC or SDK thing, the usual strife. <i>"Just when I think I'm out."</i> After some begrudging hacks, it built. SCI Companion was stable as a table and I've built from source ever since. More luck! The miracle I'd been waiting for hinged on latent knowledge of the Windows API. I bore witness and became a decompiler disciple.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					I quickly hit my limits with the scripts. Remember that first example? It's great by decompiler standards, but it's still not good enough for solving complex things like a <a href="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/super-sleuth">Sleuth-O-Meter</a>. It was taking too long to get my bearings in the game code and I didn't even know the language. <i>I didn't know anything!</i> But I did know the messages that appear in the games.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080413035345/http://www.geocities.com/sciviewer/">SCI Viewer</a> had command line tools that could dump resources and export game messages as XML. Script those up, write some regular expressions to parse out message tuples, and baby you got a stew going: one ham-fisted message annotator. No knowledge of SCI internals required. I had my foothold! Now I could get around in these message-heavy games and build from there.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					As my tools grew they set off a cycle. A typical pattern: first my parser trips on something, then I investigate and crash ScummVM, then I investigate with ScummVM's debugger and crash that, and finally it turns out that none of this ever worked and the game has been crashing since 1990. By the time it was over I'd have fixed my bug, the ScummVM bug, the debugger, and written a script patch in bytecode to fix the game. Bonus points if there was a ten year old ticket in the bug tracker. Then my parsers would scan for similar anomalies across other games and it would start all over.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					I didn't mean to build a bug hunting machine, I just wrote some parsers that weren't very bright, and things got out of hand.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					<a href="https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/graphs/contributors">
					<img src="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/images/scummvm-stats.png" alt="ScummVM contributor statistics">
					</a>
					</p>
			
					<p>
					As I learned more, I wrote proper parsers, and the annotators flourished. I was closing a lot of ScummVM tickets thanks to my decompiled scripts. But as you'll recall, SCI Companion doesn't support everything. If I couldn't decompile, then I couldn't do much. The open tickets were starting to hint at which games and versions were outside of SCI Companion's purview. So I wrote some programs to bring them into the fold. The first one converted <a href="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/quest-for-glory-i-macintosh-easter-egg">Macintosh scripts</a> to DOS with a bunch of byte-swapping. The second program downgraded SCI3 scripts to SCI2, which is so insane that I named it Conversion Therapy. Now I could decompile and annotate everything, and without touching SCI Companion's code. The tickets continued to close and the writing queue <a href="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/archive">grew</a>.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Eventually I had a big problem: the annotated scripts had gotten too good to keep to myself. But they weren't good enough to release. Even if they were, they weren't the products of a program, but a process. Then I realized just how many imperfections I was working around, reverting, or tolerating. <i>Hell's horses!</i> I'd outgrown the SCI Companion decompiler.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Obviously the problem with this pipeline is that it runs through an unmaintained Windows GUI. Obviously the solution is to replace it. Obviously there are problems with that solution:
					</p>
			
					<ol>
					<li>
					It rather involves writing a decompiler
					</li>
					<li>
					Phil's is a tough act to follow!
					</li>
					</ol>

					There was hope. Phil left a map: a <a href="https://mtnphil.wordpress.com/2016/04/09/decompiling-sci-byte-code-part-1/">four</a> <a href="https://mtnphil.wordpress.com/2016/04/09/decompiling-sci-part-2-control-flow/">part</a> <a href="https://mtnphil.wordpress.com/2016/04/09/decompiling-sci-part-3-instruction-consumption/">blog</a> <a href="https://mtnphil.wordpress.com/2016/04/09/decompiling-sci-part-4-final-steps/">series</a> on decompiling SCI — a masterclass in accessible technical writing. By now I've read a lot of decompiler literature and Phil's articles are still the best. If you want to decompile any kind of bytecode, start there.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					And so last year I used Phil's guide and started writing a decompiler, failed, tried again this year, and succeeded. I later learned that Phil also shelved his first attempt. I'd love to talk about how mine works, but we'll save that for another day. I owe us a full write-up about what it takes to get to one hundred percent.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Yes, that's right: <b>One Hundred Percent</b>. Brian's decompiler produced goto statements. Phil's fell back to assembly. I didn't want to do either, so mine fully decompiles every function in every Sierra script. No need to write fallback code if you never fail!

					You crave caveats. Well, there could be silent failures I don't know about. It seems like there must be some in all that text. Find 'em and I'll fix 'em. But the last bug affected only <i>one</i> function, and it was from a bug in Sierra's compiler, and that was a while ago. So&nbsp;I don't know what to think. As I mentioned, there are also a few versions I don't have. Maybe you do? It's mostly a handful of localized games. I don't expect any exciting scripts, but who knows? Help me find out!
					</p>
			
					<p>
					SCI Companion will always be the best way to view scripts, so I've packaged mine to be compatible; you just need the game. You can try compiling the scripts, but you're on your own there. It might work! Just remember that the version detection in SCI Companion is incomplete, so it can misinterpret accurate symbols like kernel functions. Maybe you'll fix it?
					</p>
			
					<p>
					I wish my work produced fixes for SCI Companion, but the projects didn't overlap. For one thing, I didn't use C++, because #selfcare. Bigger obstacle: I don't really know how the other decompiler works. Phil's articles are <i>so good</i> that I didn't need the code to design my own. The two decompilers must be pretty different though, because I came up with my algorithms by staring at a mess of graphs until blacking out. <i>(Dramatization! ...I Think!)</i>
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Speaking of drama! ...There's one more thing.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					<img src="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/images/codepink.jpg" alt="sierra disk in a pink drive">
					</p>
			
					<p>
					<i>Original Sierra source code.</i> That subject has been off limits, but thanks to recent events I can relax that rule. If there's anything good about performance art, it's the unexpected. I consider this performance art, and I didn't expect to be presented with a Sierra cache on deep background. There's a good story there, but it's not mine to tell. The important thing, I told myself, is that it's found its way into enough hands that it won't get lost — and won't stay underground forever.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					On Christmas Day, Jason Scott discreetly posted the original scripts for nine Sierra games to the <a href="https://archive.org/details/sierrasourcecode">Internet Archive</a>. They're also on <a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/">github</a>. I'm happy (and relieved) that we can discuss these publicly, but I have to tell you... as exciting as real source code is, annotated decompiled scripts are <i>so much more useful</i>. But you're hard to convince. So I wrote one more annotator...
					</p>
			
					<p>
					<b>My decompiled scripts include Sierra's symbols — <i>even ones not publicly available!</i></b> The annotator extracts the names of functions and variables from my cache of original scripts and matches them to decompiled scripts. Every game benefits because I also have original system scripts. Of course, if one or two games whose scripts <i>haven't</i> been posted were to have <b><i>all</i></b> of their symbols, that could raise some questions. <i>Not to worry!</i> This blog doesn't have comments.
					</p>
			
					<p>
					Speaking of comments! Let's end with one of Jeff's, the gentleman who got us into this mess. I think it will resonate with every ScummVM developer, and anyone else who plays computer games as an adult by making graphs full of assembly.
					</p>
			
					<blockquote>
						<p>
						While I did play some of the games just to see how they worked, and actually I probably played Space Quest more just because it was such a gas, but I was pretty unaware of the actual game involved. So my involvement was really at doing the tools that allowed the games to be built, and I encountered the games sort of off and on, but eh they're all just the animated things that are stories, they're not the fun part.
						</p>

					<p>
					<b><i>And I gave away the farm!</i></b>
					</p>
			
					<p>
					See, I've still got this writing queue of Sierra discoveries here, and while nothing has ever stopped <i>you</i> from finding them yourself... <i>it&nbsp;just got a heck of a lot easier!</i> So go ahead and scoop me. You can even do your own write-ups! In fact, I'd love to read them. All I ask is that you do a good job and don't skimp on the NewsRadio references. We'll call it outsourcing and they'll call me <a href="https://www.benshoof.org/blog/macho-business-donkey-wrestler">genius</a>.

          <p>Note that Keith could have got his answer minutes sooner, and needn't have kept Tim waiting. In fact, Tim could have started thinking about the question right away!</p>
<p>People who do this are generally trying to be polite by not jumping right into the request, like one would in person or on the phone - and that's great! But it's 2022 and chat is neither of those things. For most people, typing is much slower than talking. So despite best intentions, <strong>you're actually just making the other person wait</strong> for you to phrase your question, which is lost productivity (and kinda annoying).</p>
<p>The same goes for:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Hello, are you around?"</li>
<li>"hi sophie - quick question."</li>
<li>"You got a sec?"</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Who </span>would you pick to win in a head-to-head competition — a state-of-the-art AI agent or a mouse? <a href="https://neuroscience.stanford.edu/people/isaac-kauvar">Isaac Kauvar</a>, a Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute <a href="https://neuroscience.stanford.edu/research/training/postdoctoral-scholar-awards">interdisciplinary postdoctoral scholar</a>, and Chris Doyle, a machine learning researcher at Stanford, decided to pit them against each other to find out. Working in the lab of <a href="https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/nhaber">Nick Haber</a>, an assistant professor in the Stanford Graduate School of Education, Kauvar and Doyle designed a simple task based on their longtime interest in a skill set that animals naturally excel at: exploring and adapting to their surroundings. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Kauvar put a mouse in a small empty box and similarly put a simulated AI agent in an empty 3D virtual arena. Then, he placed a red ball in both environments. Kauvar measured to see which would be the quicker to explore the new object.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The test showed that the mouse quickly approached the ball and repeatedly interacted with it over the next several minutes. But the AI agent didn’t seem to notice it. “That wasn’t expected,” said Kauvar. “Already, we were realizing that even with a state-of-the-art algorithm, there were gaps in performance.” </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The scholars pondered: Could they use such seemingly simple animal behaviors as inspiration to improve AI systems?&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>That question catalyzed Kauvar, Doyle, graduate student Linqi Zhou, and Haber to design a new training method called curious replay, which programs AI agents to self-reflect about the most novel and interesting things they recently encountered. Adding curious replay was all that was needed for the AI agent to approach and engage with the red ball much faster. Plus, it dramatically improved performance on a game based on Minecraft, called Crafter. The results of this project, currently published on </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15934"><span>preprint service arXiv</span></a><span>, will be presented at the International Conference on Machine Learning on July 25. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h2><span><span><span><span><span><span>Learning Through Curiosity</span></span></span></span></span></span></h2>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>It may seem like curiosity offers only intellectual benefits, but it’s crucial to our survival, both in avoiding dangerous situations and finding necessities like food and shelter. That red ball in the experiment could be leaking a deadly poison or covering a nourishing meal, and it would be difficult to find out which if we ignore it. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>That’s why labs like Haber’s have recently been adding a curiosity signal to drive the behavior of AI agents and, in particular, model-based deep reinforcement learning agents. This signal tells them to select the action that will lead to a more interesting outcome, like opening a door rather than disregarding it. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><span><span><span><span><span><span>Read the full study,&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15934">Curious Replay for Model-based Adaptation</a></em></p>
</blockquote>



<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>But this time, the team used curiosity for AI in a new way: to help the agent learn about its world, not just make a decision. “Instead of choosing what to do, we want to choose what to think about, more or less — what experiences from our past do we want to learn from.” said Kauvar. In other words, they wanted to encourage the AI agent to self-reflect, in a sense, about its most interesting or peculiar (and thus, curiosity-related) experiences. That way, the agent may be prompted to interact with the object in different ways to learn more, which would guide its understanding of the environment and perhaps encourage curiosity toward additional items, too.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>To accomplish self-reflection in this way, the researchers amended a common method used to train AI agents, called experience replay. Here, an agent stores memories of all its interactions and then replays some of them at random to learn from them again. It was inspired by research on sleep: Neuroscientists have found that a brain region called the hippocampus will “replay” events of the day (by reactivating certain neurons) to strengthen memories. In AI agents, experience replay has led to high performance in scenarios where the environment rarely changes and clear rewards are given for the right behaviors. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>But to be successful in a changing environment, the researchers reasoned that it would make more sense for AI agents to prioritize replaying primarily the most interesting experiences — like the appearance of a new red ball —&nbsp;rather than replaying the empty virtual room over and over. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>They named their new method curious replay and found that it worked immediately. “Now, all of a sudden, the agent interacts with the ball much more quickly,” said Kauvar. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>But they didn’t stop there. They also added curious replay to AI agents playing a game called Crafter, a standard test of creative problem solving for AI agents, </span><span>where — much like in Minecraft — agents have to figure out how to survive and adapt by learning how to </span><span>collect wood and stone, make a pickaxe, and collect iron to make additional tools</span><span>.</span><span> The curious replay method boosted the current state-of-the-art score from around 14 up to 19 (humans typically score around 50) — with “just this one change,” said Kauvar. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h2><span><span><span><span><span><span>A Curious Future</span></span></span></span></span></span></h2>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The success of the curious replay method in both simple and complex tasks suggests that it will be important for a vast array of AI research moving forward. </span><span><span>“</span></span><span><span>The overall aim of this work — to make agents that can leverage prior experience and adapt well by efficiently exploring new or changing environments — will lead to much more adaptive, flexible technologies, from household robotics to personalized learning tools,” said Haber. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Kauvar, whose </span></span><a href="https://neuroscience.stanford.edu/research/funded-research/dissecting-curious-exploration-self-supervised-machine-learning"><span>postdoctoral work</span></a><span><span> is jointly mentored by Haber and neuroscientist Karl Deisseroth, the D.H Chen Professor in the departments of Bioengineering and Psychiatry, is excited to continue the theme of taking inspiration from animal behavior to improve AI systems — he plans to continue testing mice and AI agents on more complicated tasks to compare their behavior and abilities. “Lots of people give lip service to saying that they're inspired by animals, but here we are building a direct bridge — not a vague bridge. We are trying to do the exact same [tasks],” he said. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Kauvar hopes that work like this will help “close the loop” between AI research and neuroscience and benefit our understanding of animal behavior and the underlying neural processes, too. “You can imagine that this whole approach might yield hypotheses and new experiments that would never have been thought of before,” he said.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><img src="https://www.collabora.com/assets/images/blog/author/Erik-Faye-Lund.jpg" alt="Erik Faye-Lund avatar">
</p>
<p>Erik Faye-Lund <br>July 06, 2023</p>

</div><div>
<p>Today, <a href="https://www.imaginationtech.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Imagination Technologies</a> announced some very exciting news: they are now <a href="https://blog.imaginationtech.com/imagination-gpus-now-support-opengl-4.6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using Zink for full OpenGL 4.6 support</a>! Collabora had the pleasure of working together with engineers from Imagination to make this a reality, and it's very rewarding to now be able show the results to the world!</p>
<p>This is the first time we've seen a hardware vendor trust the OpenGL-on-Vulkan Mesa driver enough to completely <em>side-step</em> a native OpenGL driver and use it in a <em>shipping product</em>. It's wonderful to see that Zink can realistically be used as a work-horse, <strong>especially</strong> in a high-performance graphics setting.</p>
<p>Zink <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/blog/2018/10/31/introducing-zink-opengl-implementation-vulkan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started out</a> as a small R&amp;D project at Collabora, but has since grown to be a full-on community project. None of this would have been possible without the awesome work done by <a href="https://www.supergoodcode.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Mike</a> and the other Zink contributors!</p>
<h3>Conformance</h3>
<p>One small detail from Imagination's post that I think is important to highlight is that the solution is <a href="https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-products/opengl#submission_332" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">officially conformant</a>. This is the first product to be officially conformant using Zink, but it's not going to be the last! In fact, we only need one more conformant implementation before Zink itself is conformant as a generic layered implementation, according to the Khronos <a href="https://www.khronos.org/files/conformance_procedures.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Conformant Product Criteria</a>.</p>
<h3>An Open Source graphics future</h3>
<p>In the not too distant future, we should be able to combine Zink with the in-progress <a href="https://developer.imaginationtech.com/open-source-gpu-driver/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">open source driver</a> from Imagination, and that's when things will <em>really</em> start to shine for the open source graphics stack on Imagination hardware. So there's plenty more to look forward to here!</p>

We envision a future where chat-based models can support any use case.&nbsp;Today we’re announcing a deprecation plan for older models of the Completions API, and recommend that users adopt the Chat Completions API.<br></p></div><div id="gpt-4-api-general-availability" data-heading=""><p><h2>GPT-4 API general availability</h2></p></div><div><p>GPT-4 is our most capable model. Millions of developers have requested access to the GPT-4 API since March, and the range of <a href="https://openai.com/customer-stories" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">innovative products</a> leveraging GPT-4 is growing every day. Today all existing API developers with a history of successful payments can access the GPT-4 API with 8K context. We plan to open up access to new developers by the end of this month, and then start raising rate-limits after that depending on compute availability.</p><p>Based on the stability and readiness of these models for production-scale use, we are also making the GPT-3.5 Turbo, DALL·E and Whisper APIs generally available. We are working on safely enabling fine-tuning for GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo and expect this feature to be available later this year.<br></p></div><div id="moving-from-text-completions-to-chat-completions" data-heading=""><p><h2>Moving from text completions to chat completions</h2></p></div><div><p>We introduced the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Chat Completions API</a> in March, and it now accounts for 97% of our API GPT usage.&nbsp;</p><p>The initial Completions API was introduced in June 2020 to provide a freeform text prompt for interacting with our language models. We’ve since learned that we can often provide better results with a more structured prompt interface. The chat-based paradigm has proven to be powerful, handling the vast majority of previous use cases and new conversational needs, while providing higher flexibility and specificity. In particular, the Chat Completions API’s structured interface (e.g., system messages, function calling) and multi-turn conversation capabilities enable developers to build conversational experiences and a broad range of completion tasks. It also helps lower the risk of prompt injection attacks, since user-provided content can be structurally separated from instructions.<br></p></div><div><!--[--><figure><figcaption> Text summarization </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption> Code completion </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption> Few-shot learning </figcaption></figure><!--]--></div><div><p>We plan to continue investing most of our platform efforts in this direction, as we believe it will offer an increasingly capable and easy-to-use experience for developers. We’re working on closing the last few remaining gaps of the Chat Completions API quickly, such as log probabilities for completion tokens and increased steerability to reduce the “chattiness” of responses.<br></p></div><div id="deprecation-of-older-models-in-the-completions-api" data-heading=""><p><h2>Deprecation of older models in the Completions API</h2></p></div><div><p>As part of our increased investment in the Chat Completions API and our efforts to optimize our compute capacity, in 6 months we will be retiring some of our older models using the Completions API.

We plan for future model and product improvements to focus on the Chat Completions API, and do not have plans to publicly release new models using the Completions API.</p><p>Starting January 4, 2024, <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/deprecations" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">older completion models</a> will no longer be available, and will be replaced with the following models:<br></p></div><div><table>

According to the Khronos® Group, OpenGL® is the most widely adopted 2D and 3D graphics API. Since its launch in 1992 it has been used extensively by software developers for PCs and workstations to create high-performance, visually compelling graphics applications for markets such as CAD, content creation, entertainment, game development and virtual reality.</p> 
<!--more-->
<p><span>To date, </span><span></span><span></span><span>Imagination GPUs have natively supported OpenGL® up until Release 3.3 as well as OpenGL® ES (the version of OpenGL® for embedded systems), Vulkan® (a cross-platform graphics API) and OpenCL™ (an API for parallel programming).</span><span></span><span> However, thanks to the increasing performance of our top-end GPUs, especially with the likes of the </span><a href="https://www.imaginationtech.com/product/img-dxt-72-2304/"><span>DXT-72-2304</span></a><span>, they present a competitive offering to the data centre and desktop (DCD) market. Indeed, we have multiple customers – including the likes of </span><a href="https://www.imaginationtech.com/resources/imagination-and-innosilicon-case-study-en/"><span>Innosilicon</span></a><span> – choosing Imagination GPUs </span><span></span><span></span><span>for the flexibility an IP solution, their scalability and their ability to offer up to 6 TFLOPS of compute.</span><span></span></p> 
<p>To support our customers in the DCD market, Imagination is investing in its API coverage. This starts with the extension of our support of OpenGL® from version 3.3 to version 4.6 – the latest <span>version of OpenGL®</span><span></span>. The solution is Khronos conformant and available now following its release in DDK Rel.23.1. The video below demonstrates OpenGL® 4.6 content running on Imagination GPUs.</p>

</p> 
</div> 
 
<p>Support has been achieved by working alongside the open-source specialists at <a href="https://www.collabora.com/">Collabora</a>. Collabora’s Zink is a layered OpenGL® implementation, part of the open-source Mesa project, that allows OpenGL® 4.6 content to run on top of a native Vulkan driver. For Imagination GPUs, this is a win-win. While OpenGL® is now being used less frequently by developers who are preferring newer APIs such as Vulkan and DirectX, due to its previous popularity there are numerous legacy applications that wouldn’t work on Imagination hardware if we didn’t have driver-level support for its final version. Delivering support for OpenGL® 4.6 via our Vulkan drivers is as elegant solution that keeps our graphics stack simple.</p> 
<p>This project has been one of a number of Imagination open-source projects.<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span>As a company we value the contribution that open-source technology offers to the ecosystem, enabling developers to excel at specific areas of differentiation rather than re-inventing the wheel each time. Our <a href="https://developer.imaginationtech.com/open-source-gpu-driver/">Open Source GPU Driver</a> project is a unique approach to supporting silicon vendors, OEMs and graphics developers take control of the complete graphics software stack. Imagination GPUs are <a href="https://blog.imaginationtech.com/the-gpu-of-choice-for-risc-v">the perfect partner to RISC-V CPUs</a>, <span><span>the emergent open-source architecture - and o</span></span>ur very own <a href="https://www.imaginationtech.com/products/cpu/">RISC-V CPU</a> is another example of how Imagination is leveraging open source to bring a differentiated product to market in a brief amount of time. In turn, we are contributing back into the open-source community. Within RISC-V International, <span><a href="https://blog.imaginationtech.com/why-weve-levelled-up-on-risc-v">we sit on the Board of Directors</a></span> and the Technical Steering Committee and we also take a leading role in a number of special interest groups.</p> 
<p>With the release of DDK Rel.23.1, Imagination GPUs now support OpenGL® 4.6. Meanwhile w<span>e are continuing to develop our API support in line with our customers’ needs and will have further announcements coming in this area soon.</span><span></span></p></span>

            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>In 2023, the way to use AES is AES-GCM. Anything else is very unlikely to make sense. We might not like that, we might wish OCB hadn’t been patented, but with hardware support in most processors these days GCM is both faster than the alternatives, ubiquitous, and just tolerable to implement.</p>
<p>Still, I don’t want to use AES-GCM, I want to use XAES-256-GCM/11, which has a number of nice properties and only the annoying defect of not existing.</p>
<p>The problem with AES-GCM is that its nonce is a little too small to comfortably select at random. At 96 bit, the probability of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_attack?ref=words.filippo.io">birthday bound</a> collision becomes uncomfortable (2<sup>-32</sup>) after a few billion messages (2<sup>32</sup>), and <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/475?ref=words.filippo.io">the consequences of a collision are catastrophic</a>.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> Some applications know they will never encrypt that many messages under a single key, but those numbers are a little too low and the consequences too dire to make that assumption at the API level, so we’re forced to delegate nonce management to the user.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>ChaCha20Poly1305 has the same issue, which is why the <em>extended-nonce</em> construction XChaCha20Poly1305 exists. It resolves the issue by taking a 192-bit nonce<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>, and “hashing” it along with the key into a fresh key.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> The key is 256 bits, so there is no need to ever worry about collisions there. (More on that later.) You should <em>always</em> use the X variant unless the nonce is fully implicit, like when it’s always zero (like in age), a record counter (like in TLS), or a chunk number (like in STREAM). You can also make nice APIs for the X variant that generate the nonce at random from the system CSPRNG (and we are thinking about how to best do that in the Go standard library).</p>
<p>XChaCha20Poly1305 uses ChaCha20 itself to do the hashing to avoid introducing a new primitive, but this would work just as well using SHA-256 or HKDF to derive a regular key and nonce for ChaCha20Poly1305 from a key and a larger nonce. This means you could do the same for AES-GCM, and some schemes do in fact do just that. Regrettably, we don’t have a name for it, so you can’t just say to people “you should <em>always</em> use the X variant” or make a nice interoperable API for it.</p>
<p>Anyway, that’s the X in my <s>pony</s> XAES-256-GCM/11.</p>
<p>I don’t care if it uses HKDF, or SHA-256, or the AES function<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>: I want a well-defined scheme that takes a key and 192 bits of nonce and hashes them into a derived key and 96 bits of nonce for use with AES-GCM.</p>
<p>Even with AES-128, the combined 224 bits of space for key and nonce are juuuust enough not to worry about collisions in the derived values. Still, this hints to the second part of the <s>pony</s> problem with AES-GCM: while <a href="https://words.filippo.io/dispatches/post-quantum-age/#128-bits-are-enough">actually enough for post-quantum cryptography</a>, 128-bit keys are still too tight for <em>multi-user security</em>. If for example an application encrypts 2<sup>48</sup> messages under different 128-bit keys, and all messages start with the same few bytes, an attacker can build a lookup table, try and lookup the ciphertext of 2<sup>64</sup> keys, and <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=log2%281+-+%281+-+2%5E48+%2F+2%5E128%29+%5E+%282%5E64%29%29&amp;ref=words.filippo.io">have a 2<sup>-16</sup> chance</a> to decrypt one message. Not good.</p>
<p>Multi-user attacks can be mitigated by many things—they require fixed nonces and partially known plaintext—but the only way to avoid that complexity escaping the AEAD abstraction and leaking into the rest of the protocol is to use 256-bit keys. For AES-GCM, that means using AES-256. Too bad that AES-256 is slower than AES-128, not because of its bigger key size, but because it was specified with more rounds, presumably under the assumption that users of bigger keys would also want more security margin against cryptanalysis. AES is an iterated cipher, where four core operations are performed multiple times in sequence: AES-128 performs them ten times, while AES-256 performs them fourteen times. AES-256 doesn’t <em>have to be</em> slower than AES-128, it was just defined to be slower. That’s regrettable, because it applies an artificial performance tax on the use of longer keys, which are desirable for reasons that have nothing to do with the risk of AES cryptanalysis.</p>
<p>Picking the “right” number of rounds is hard, and it’s kind of an open secret in the community that there is no rigorous and scientific way to do it. “<em><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1492?ref=words.filippo.io">Too much crypto</a></em>” by Aumasson is all about this, and suggests eleven rounds for AES-256. I started this aiming for ten, which would have been exactly as fast as AES-128, but AES-256 does need more margin than AES-128 in some rare cases for <em>reasons</em><sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup> and I guess it’d be silly to introduce a different abstraction-leaking edge case while trying to remove two, so AES-256/11 it is.</p>
<p>Summing up, I would like to provide to my users the extended-nonce 256-bit reduced-rounds XAES-256-GCM/11 (or XAES-256/11-GCM?) AEAD. It has infinitely randomizable nonces, a comfortable margin of multi-user security, and nearly the same performance as AES-128-GCM. It would also be a true drop-in replacement for XChaCha20Poly1305. Only issue is that it doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>(I guess it would also not be FIPS 140 compliant. We could make a FIPS version that’s slower but equivalent by using HKDF to derive the key, and the full-rounds AES-256.)</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2023-07-06</strong>: Soatok has <a href="https://soatok.blog/2022/12/21/extending-the-aes-gcm-nonce-without-nightmare-fuel/?ref=words.filippo.io">previously suggested an extended-nonce AES-GCM construction</a>. His AES-XGCM uses CBC-MAC for key derivation, which might be a good pick as both primitive-parsimonious and potentially FIPS 140 compliant. @NohatCoder@mastodon.gamedev.place on Mastodon suggests that since we're KDF'ing, we might as well generate all the subkeys directly, solving the AES-256-specific issues that require the extra rounds (see <sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6:1">[6:1]</a></sup>). I'm a bit wary to diverge too much from the well-established primitives, since at that point might as well use something novel (such as <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-aegis-aead/?ref=words.filippo.io">AEGIS</a>, like Soatok says). The point here is that I'd like a thin construction that's easy to get confidence for if you already trust AES-GCM.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>You’ll sometimes hear that any single-key AES mode can only produce 2<sup>48</sup> blocks before the advantage of a distinguishing attacker gets uncomfortable. That would seem contradictory with a limit of 2<sup>32</sup> messages for AES-GCM, since each message can be up to 2<sup>32</sup> blocks. The thing is that the only thing that an attacker can do by observing more than 2<sup>48</sup> blocks is confirm that they’re looking at AES rather than at complete randomness. A completely random stream would be expected to show some output block collisions after that many blocks, while AES, being an invertible permutation applied on a counter and unique nonce, will never repeat. The <em>lack</em> of collisions is the distinguisher. NIST doesn’t care, and neither do I. <a href="#fnref1">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Technically, GCM accepts longer nonces. However, nonces longer than 96 bits are hashed into a starting 128-bit counter value, leaving no dedicated counter space. (96-bit nonces are instead concatenated with a 32-bit counter.) The birthday bound of 128 bits is better, allowing us to encrypt in theory 2<sup>48</sup> messages (the approximate formula is 2<sup>(N-32)/2</sup>), but that’s only if every message was precisely one block long. If messages are longer, there’s a risk the counter will overlap across messages, which is not as catastrophic and easy to detect as nonce reuse, but leads to loss of confidentiality. In general, it’s very inconvenient for bounds to depend on the message size, because that’s yet another assessment we have to delegate to the application. AES-GCM-SIV has the same issue: it has better bounds for shorter messages, but worse for messages longer than 8 GiB, and the answer to “how many messages can I encrypt” is a double entry table instead of a number. <a href="#fnref2">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Technically, 128 bits of nonce are hashed with 256 bits of key into 256 bits of key, and 64 bits of nonce are used as nonce, which leaves 32 bits of nonce space that can be reassigned to counter, if you need to encrypt more than 256 GB. In practice, <a href="https://cs.opensource.google/go/x/crypto/+/refs/tags/v0.10.0:chacha20poly1305/xchacha20poly1305.go;l=46-53;drc=c084706c2272f3d44b722e988e70d4a58e60e7f4?ref=words.filippo.io">we don’t support that</a>. What counts as key, nonce, and counter in ChaCha20 is really just arbitrary: 384 bits of variable state are mixed with 128 bits of constants for each block, and you need to make sure you never reuse the same state. The original ChaCha20 had 64 bits of nonce and 64 bits of counter, the IETF moved 32 bits from nonce to counter, making random nonces juuust tempting but not quite safe. Anyway. <a href="#fnref3">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn4"><p>In a sense XChaCha20Poly1305 is a SIV construction in the same way AES-GCM-SIV is: they both compute a synthetic (key, nonce) rather than a synthetic nonce alone. 🤔 However, the message is not one of the inputs in the XChaCha20Poly1305 derivation, so it’s not misuse resistant. There are some interesting parallels here with <a href="https://words.filippo.io/dispatches/avoid-the-randomness-from-the-sky/">signature nonce generation</a>, where the best design turns out to be hashing message <em>and</em> randomness into it. <a href="#fnref4">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn5"><p>Although if we’re doing this, we might as well do it cleanly and use AES like XChaCha20Poly1305 or GHASH like AES-GCM-SIV. <a href="#fnref5">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn6"><p>Interestingly enough, AES-256 turned out to actually have a legitimate (if maybe unexpected) need for more rounds, because the 256-bit key schedule (the way the key is expanded into subkeys for the various rounds) is simpler and more vulnerable to related-key attacks. In 2009/2010 we got some impractical related-key attacks against AES-256/14, and <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2009/374?ref=words.filippo.io">some “practical” related-key attacks against AES-256/9</a>. The paper does a good job of explaining the background in the first few sections. The related-key attack setting is very contrived: an attacker can recover a key K if it’s able to get an encryption oracle for a K <em>and</em> for K⊕C. There is apparently one protocol that somehow managed that, but these days I’d hope all keys are the output of a CSPRNG or a KDF, not some haphazard XOR operation. (There was also an attack against AES-256/11 which required even more implausible relations between the keys.) I also suspect that the key derivation step of the extended-nonce construction we discussed above would rule out these related-key attacks. Anyway. <a href="#fnref6">↩︎</a> <a href="#fnref6:1">↩︎</a></p>

                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: Right, so it all started in 2018 when I went to a drug rehab program, because I've been struggling with substance abuse for a very long time. And when I came out of that rehab program, I found myself with just so much free time and I had no idea what to do with all of it. And I started programming because that's something I knew how to do lots of, and that's how I ended up working on random things that I'd always wanted to do, but never felt I had the time for. And the big project I started was an operating system, because I always thought that seemed cool, but never really sunk my teeth into it properly, or never really gave it a fair shake. And I had a lot of fun with that, and it just grew and grew and grew. And I put it online and other people found it, and a little community formed around it. And that community just grew and grew and so did the operating system and the scope of it. And at some point, we had built a GUI and we had all the widgets, buttons, check boxes, all that stuff. And I thought, 'Hey, wouldn't it be nice if we could display rich text, and wouldn't it be sweet if we could use HTML as the internal representation of a rich text widget?' And I started just putting together a simple HTML widget that you could view, simple text that had bold, italic, stuff like that. That was what I was trying to achieve. And it just escalated from there because it was really fun to hack on and just add more tags, start to add CSS and so on. And it just incrementally grew to the point where I had to admit that, I guess, this is a browser, not just a rich text widget anymore. </blockquote></li>

Spent six and a half years I think at Apple, working at Safari. And then I left, got into some troubles, and ended up in the aforementioned rehab clinic. And then, now I'm doing Ladybird, which was just supposed to be an HTML widget, I guess, is the essence of the story. But Ladybird today has come quite far from that original humble beginnings, of course. We've managed to build a fairly capable engine, and it's all from scratch, just like everything else on SerenityOS, we pride ourselves on stubbornly just doing everything from scratch, even though it would be much more convenient not to. </blockquote></li>

But I didn't want to call it Ladybug because then it sounds like it would be buggy. And I thought, 'Remember when Firefox was called Firebird? That was a pretty cool name. What if we call it Ladybird?' Because I hear that in the UK that means ladybug anyway, so yeah. </blockquote></li>

                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: So there are many things that factor into it, but the two main ones are, I used to work at Apple for a long time, and I got so used to this culture that they have there of all the experts on the whole system are all in the same building or in the adjacent building, and you can just go talk to them. And I always thought that is so sweet because you have some super gnarly esoteric problem in some system library, and the guy who wrote it is just next door. And I always felt like in the open source world, they don't have that. And I wanted to, after I left Apple, I still craved that kind of environment. So I thought, 'If it doesn't exist, what if I try to create it?' So I wanted to just build a system where we can cultivate all the expertise in one place and we can be super accountable, so that whatever the problem is, you can never blame anybody outside the project. Blame always stays within the repository. And I think it's, as you say, it is very difficult to work that way, but it has also created a very strong community because people enjoy working in that kind of space where they get to become experts and they get to take extreme ownership of system components in a way that I think is much, much harder in the Linux wider open source ecosystem. And the other aspect of why we do this is because it's fun. It's fun to build things from scratch. Everybody knows that. And it was supposed to be a hobby project that I was just doing to fill up my time. So it is rooted in just fun time spending programming activity, and I hope it never shakes that origin. </blockquote></li>

                  <blockquote><cite>Brian Kardell</cite>: It was CoRecursive, right. Yeah, that was it. But it was a good podcast and I really can relate in a way to the time that suddenly is free. I've had other moments in my life that were not specifically that, but where you have some really major life change and the minutes just go forever, and finding yourself a thing that you can throw yourself into is really helpful. For me, it was usually art, painting. But, so we have a series on here called Web Ecosystem Health, when engine disappears, that's the whole story. There's so many pieces that go into is this a healthy ecosystem or not, that maybe focusing on the exact number isn't the important part. What is the ideal number? Is it 3, 5, 7? We don't know. I think Jeremy Keith said, 'It's like political parties. One is definitely too few, and a hundred is probably too many, and somewhere in between there is a series of debatably good numbers.' But in that podcast, we have said a bunch of times that you're more likely to lose engines than to gain them unless it's by evolution, like KHTML becomes WebKit becomes Chromium. And recently, at the Web Engine HackFest, we had two presentations of novel browser engines. It seems to really fly in the face of what I've argued, but I don't think that it does. And I want to ask what you think, Andreas. So you know, you've said on your podcast, 'People say you can't build a browser engine from scratch,' and you say, 'Sure you can.' I don't say that you can't, I just say that it's really, really hard to create a fully featured and competitive mainstream competitor to WebKit and Gecko and Chrome. I would think that for both these engines, that's a ways off, right? </blockquote></li>

                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: If you look at the quality of specifications today compared to 10 years ago, for example, the specifications are vastly better today. The effort that the CSS working group, for example, has put into just clarifying so many things makes it actually possible for someone like me who never worked on CSS's layout to go and write a layout engine without a team of experts around me or even having to ask for help much. And I think that's fantastic. And I was pleasantly surprised because I was going into this assuming that it was like the olden days still, that you would end up sitting with CSS 2.1 and trying to guess your way through the various descriptions of blocking and line layout, because that's what I had seen my coworkers do at Apple, just struggling with the old CSS world. But nowadays, the specs have gotten so good, and it's not that they're perfect, but that they're really a lot better than they've ever been. So I think just from that alone, it is a lot easier today than people might think. And I think what you describe, it's absolutely true that it's a ton of work. It's absolutely true that it's hard to build something that will be mainstream competitive, of course. Google throws hundreds of engineers at this and they have full-time people working on it around the clock. It would be silly to say that we're going to out-compete them at their own game, but I think it's still possible to build a browser that can render a significant majority of the web at a satisfying fidelity, let's say. And I also like to think that if you can gain enough momentum that you get to the point where you have a decent rendering of most websites that people care about, you can then gain an enough momentum that you attract people to go and fill in the niche gaps that they might care about, and you might attract funding and so on. So that part is up in the air, but I think if we can go hard and fast enough that we end up there, who knows what can happen. So I'm just very optimistic, I guess. </blockquote></li>

                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: Because operating systems are fairly simple when you boil it down to what you really want to do. Kernel is a well understood, well-defined problem, and in our case, we're just working on the POS-x specifications. We're building a Unix compatible operating system, and that means we have a set of APIs that we need to support, and that work is really straightforward. And then, we have a UI paradigm that we borrow from late 90s Windows, Microsoft Office, that kind of stuff. So we already know what we need to do there, too. We need to build this UI and these interactions, and so on. And I don't know, I just found that work really straightforward, whereas with the web stuff, I know I was just saying that the specs are better than ever, but it is still hard to get all the specs gluing together, I think. And really when it comes to CSS, I would say CSS is so much harder than any of the other parts of the web platform because it's hard to work on any CSS module in isolation. It really requires the person working on CSS stuff to understand multiple specs at the same time, and then keep them in their head and implement multiple things at the same time, if that makes sense. It is so much easier to work on JavaScript or HTML or Fetch or any of those specs, because they are more self-contained. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Brian Kardell</cite>: To the point of what you were saying about specs have gotten so much better, one of the things that definitely started those riggers was when Hixie sat down and specified the actual HTML parser, which never had really been written down the way that it needed to work. So, there was a way that it needed to work. There was an interoperable subset, and that was never written down, and there were some rough edges that you couldn't get people to agree on until you had something written down. So, I know that that has been cited as a great accomplishment, and other people have said that they've used that to build a parser. We just did a podcast with Martin Robinson on Servo, and in that, we had this observation, this thought that every browser that comes along fresh and implements something ends up making the specs a little better for the next ones to do it. I noticed that you had several issues open in HTML parser, and I think it's probably because you're the last one to look at it with really fresh eyes, right? </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: Sure, yeah, that's absolutely a thing. And it's also one of the big things that I hope that we can do for the community of web engines is to just give our input as a recent implementer. And we haven't been super great about it yet. Yeah, you can find some bugs that we filed, but for the most part, until recently, whenever we had a problem, it was pretty safe to assume it was because of something we had done wrong. And it's only in the recent couple of months that we've matured to the point where now we start to find spec bugs more often and spec issues. And that has been a really exciting transition, actually, and we're just looking forward to helping out more in that area, at least with regards to HTML and CSS. In JavaScript, we were a bit ahead of that curve, because our engine has been implementing some proposals pretty early. So we implemented the temporal proposal when it was still quite new. And we were able to give a lot of feedback on that, which then helped evolve the spec. Now we're a little bit behind because I think people got a bit burned out on updating it whenever the spec changed. But yeah, that's absolutely something that I agree with Martin on that, that every new engine will make the specs better, and next year and the year after that, you'll be able to say that there has never been a better time to build a new browser engine, I hope. </blockquote></li>

And then that is true for many CSS properties and I expect that to have fallout in a lot of tests, because we might be able to pass the test if we were just doing some random CSS thing more correctly. And we've taken a very vertical slice approach to adding functionality to the browser. And by that, I mean we don't tend to implement a whole spec and then move on to the next spec. What we tend to do is we tend to find a webpage that we want to improve for whatever reason. Maybe it's cool to get the New York Times to render, and then we just spend a bunch of time fixing as many issues as we can for that site and then move on to a new page or some new thing that we want to be able to do. And that might not be the most structured approach to it, but it has been very, very good at keeping people motivated and excited and engaged in the work, which from my perspective is almost more important than having an optimal structure to the work, because it's mostly volunteers working on it. I'm the only person who is full-time employed to do this, so I need to keep it fun for people to work on. </blockquote></li>

And people get so excited about that that you have to talk them down a little bit, and that can be a little bit frustrating to deal with because obviously we're nowhere near competitive and it's going to take a long time before we will be. So, none of the things that you brought up were negative. I think they're just fact. We don't have all of these technologies yet and it's going to take time to build them, but I think we are making good progress and the future is open. </blockquote></li>

                  <blockquote><cite>Brian Kardell</cite>: What's really interesting to me is I feel like there's an evolutionary question here about what is acceptable enough for people to the vast majority of people to use it and even make it a daily driver. Do you know what I mean? I think that's a really interesting question. And you can see that even a little bit in the Chromium browsers. A lot of, they're actually missing a bunch of those things when they're new. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: Yeah, I think that sort of thing has always been part of the web, at least for as long as I've been a web citizen. When I was a kid, it was, 'This site works best in this or that browser. You need NN4 to browse here, or you got to get IE5,' and these days you've got to use a Chromium based browser. And I think they're just different sides of the same coin. There's always going to be somebody who's pushing for new APIs and new 'standards' to become part of the platform. And I think it's perfectly fine to lag behind on stuff like that. With Ladybird, I'm primarily interested in implementing stuff that is used by the overwhelming majority of the web and make the engine hackable enough and plugable enough that in the future, if there is a demand for more niche features, then it will be reasonably easy to add them to the engine. But it seems at the moment, if I have to choose where to spend my time, I would rather implement more core CSS, JavaScript functionality than any of these new, fancy things that are only used by a fraction of a percent of websites. That's not to say that they're bad ideas, it's just that they're just trying to go where the big ball is instead of chasing the small ball. </blockquote></li>

They also frequently lack many of these. They're not, I don't know, like Tim would say, 'The waft and weft of the web,' that that's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. One of the things that struck me, I guess the thing that's most surprising to me, is if you go to Google or Apple or Firefox, the people who work on the JavaScript engine, they're not generally the people who work on layout. And even within layout, you have people who specialize in internationalization, or there's lots of specialization, but you have to solve everything. And that is really interesting to me. Is that intimidating to you at all, or are you just built differently? </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: It was intimidating. When I started building the operating system, I was intimidated, and I just kept pushing through that for so long that I forgot. I woke up one day and I forgot to be intimidated, I think, and it just stayed off since then. So I stopped caring. And I think, I also have my YouTube channel where I broadcast myself programming, and that has been very helpful in just taking down my ego, because whenever I make a mistake, I hear about it from people making fun of me. And at first, that was really hard because I wasn't used to that harsh feedback and people making silly jokes about stupid things that I would do. But over time, that accumulated into this hardening of my soul, I guess, where I just became able to push through that intimidation stuff. And it was a lot of work, but I'm happy that I went through that process because now I'm happy to take on anything and suck at it for a while, and do it anyway until I get somewhat better. And then by the time I get somewhat better at something, hopefully I've managed to put something together that other people can help me improve. And that's how most of SerenityOS, most of Ladybird started, was just me pushing through, sucking at something I didn't know how to do, and figuring some of it out, and then other people coming in and helping. And I still do a lot of that, but nowadays, I have gotten a bit more specialized recently because there's just so much specialized work to do on a browser, like you mentioned Grid and Flexbox, for example. I've spent weeks working on our Flexbox implementation, just getting various details right, and it requires some amount of specialization. But I think in a project like ours, we can't afford to all be specialists. It's okay to specialize for short periods, but at the core, if we want to make progress with such a small team and such a shoestring budget, we have to be willing to be generalists. </blockquote></li>

There is not just the specs that have improved so much over the years, but there's countless discussions on what Ouija, GitHub, for example, you can go and read discussions on spec bugs where people explain and argue in depth about, 'Oh, why should it be this way? Why should it be that way?' So there's a tremendous amount of information you can absorb if you know where to look. And as we talked about, I also have a background in browsers, so I do know how to go and find information because it was my job for many years, as well. So I know where the information is. I have friends who work on other browsers still. So, I think, me personally, I benefit so much from having done it for a long time, just like anybody with experience doing something is going to be drawing on that experience, of course. But as a project, we also benefit from other engines having pushed the standards forward, having improved the platform. And also just from the web being an open platform that's developed in the open. It would be much harder to do this kind of stuff with a closed platform, obviously, like if we were trying to implement a .net VM or something. </blockquote></li>

So, which would you prefer the same browser to present the same controls in every operating system? If you open Chrome, it always looks like Chrome. If you look at Safari, well, it is only available in one place, so that's not much. But Firefox, for example, you open it anywhere, they all look the same, or do we match the operating system. And I thought, I was convinced in my head, this is the most ridiculous question. This is going to be such a one-sided, there's clearly one answer to this. And no, it was literally 50/50.

And I'm sure that there are still some little things here and there with an OpenBSD origin that we need to replace. It just needs to be tracked down. So, I think, for me, the important thing nowadays is that we definitely don't want anybody bringing any proprietary IP into the project, and we don't want people to take something that's GPL because we are a BSD license project, so that wouldn't be entirely cool. And of course, the spirit of the project is that we're supposed to make things ourselves even though it's hard.

People still float between these organizations. And if you look at Google today, there's a bunch of Mozilla people, and people have just been moving around that. There are only so many people in the world who want to be browser developers, or at least so I thought until I started doing it on YouTube and broadcasting what it's like to an audience of random onlookers, and it turned out that it could be made interesting to more people by letting them in on this angle of it. And I'm really, really happy to have been able to introduce so many people to it, and gotten hundreds of newcomers just to do a patch or two for a browser engine. Even if most people end up not loving it enough to stick around, we still have a bunch of people who have stuck around and worked on it, and that to me is a really wholesome aspect of what I get to call my job.

                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: I think, yeah, that really has been the main driver of new people, at least until this point. If I compare my numbers, my audience numbers on every platform that I use to attract people to what we're doing, YouTube is by far doing the best. And the format is surprisingly interesting to people. Just, 'Here's a browser. Here is the website that doesn't look right. I'm going to make it look right. Stick with me for an hour and we'll figure it out.'</blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Brian Kardell</cite>: I have to say I didn't watch any of the ones where you worked on browser features, but I did watch the one where you worked on doing the Qt browser for Linux. And so, just for background, I did some computer science in college and I had to learn C back then, but professionally, I only did C maybe once or twice. So the C world is intimidating to me, but I can open WebKit source code and find things, and if I read slowly, I can figure it out. So it's intimidating to me, and every once in a while I get WebKit and get it built and then just lose steam. It's so much yak shaving to get it built in the first place that I lose the steam to do it. But the reason I mentioned that is because I turned it on and immediately you were going pretty fast and I was like, 'Oh man, this is really intimidating. Look how much this guy just really knows what he's doing. I am not sure I'm going to be able to follow this at all.' But it didn't take long before you rammed your face into the door a few times with the same kind of stuff that trips me up. And somehow that just made it very engaging and more plausible, somehow, that I could do it. Do you know what I mean? I don't know if that makes sense. So I think that's motivating. You struggled a lot in that, right? I watched it. I don't know if that's common, but there were things that you knew that you didn't have to look up. You were doing it like riding a bike. You were so fluent in it. That stuff was cool, but honestly, the parts where you struggled were just so relatable and watching you work through them, I was like, 'Yeah, that's exactly what I would've done, too.' And one by one, you just have to step through the things. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: Yeah, totally. And I think that's one thing that many people who make programming content, video content in particular, they make the wrong choice by editing out mistakes and trying to look perfect and fast and right all the time. Because as you say, then it just ends up looking intimidating or too polished, and you don't get that human side of it. You've got to show the frustration and the stupid mistakes. At least, I really feel like that's how I've been able to build an audience is by just showing the whole thing, with warts and all. And yes, that is representative by the way. I do screw up in every single video. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Brian Kardell</cite>: Well, in life, too. It's pretty easy to screw up. I think it's important to keep in mind. I am really, really excited about seeing where this goes in the rest of my lifetime, basically. Not in the next six months, although that's also exciting. But to see where all this develops because KHTML runs the world now, and it sure didn't start that way, right? </blockquote></li>

                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: And I think a lot of great things have come out of that. And I hope that they carry that forward and continue to be experimental, or experiment friendly at least, because there's so many things that you could do in a browser engine that is very inconvenient to do in the big engines because there's so much code you would have to rewrite just to try out new architectures and new ways of doing things. One thing that I thought of in this area is that one of the things that we try to do with our browser and with our engine is that we try to write it as close to the spec as possible. This is a bit different from the way other browsers are made, at least the ones I've been familiar with, like WebKit, Chromium, and Gecko, where they are happy to invent their own abstractions and solve things in their own ways. We are very, very hardcore about sticking to spec architecture and spec language and using the spec names for everything wherever we can, in part because it makes it just easier to implement the spec, if you write it exactly as the spec says to the fullest extent possible. But also for maintainability, because we have to recognize that the platform is alive and it keeps changing and keeps mutating. And if we want to have a chance to react and adapt to future changes, I really believe that we'll be in the best position to do that if we keep ourselves as close to the current spec as possible. So, we are... In HTML. For example, we have our class names in C++ are just the same exact words that they use for the same concepts in the HML spec. Our CSS layout engine is organized around formatting contexts, unlike the way it works in the other engines where they invent their own ways to do layout. And it's just a theme throughout. And we also take it a step even further by copying spec text word for word and just copy pasting it as comment into our code, so that you can always cross reference the spec with the code because we have the spec right there. So it's interleaved. So you would have a spec comment that says like, 'Step three, do X, Y, Z.' And then the code, X, Y, Z. 'Step four,' and so on. And it took a while to convince ourselves that this was a good way to work, because it makes the code a lot bigger and it can look bloated. But after we got used to it, I don't think we would ever go back, because it's such a much easier way to stay on top of the spec and what the spec intends, and to be able to react to changes. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Brian Kardell</cite>: Martin made a similar comment actually, because I guess this is a thing in Rust... I'm sorry, in Servo, at least in the newer. So, Servo has two layout engines, and I guess this is something that it seems all of the engines have learned and started changing to do that. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: Yeah. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Brian Kardell</cite>: Martin, he seemed to suggest that this is basically a lesson that all of the browser engines have learned. And it's hard to... We can't just rewrite them, but we can migrate them in that direction. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: Right, and for us, it's a lot easier to do this because we are in a green field environment. We don't have a huge stack of code that needs to be rewritten. So we've been able to make really good and fast progress towards this, and that's really nice. But of course, the others will catch up, and I think it would be great if more engines look more like the spec because it will be easier to cross reference and catch bugs and so on. And it'll also be easier for people to move between different engines, and people with special interests who want to implement a feature in all engines, the more the code looks like the spec everywhere, the easier it'll be for them, as well. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Brian Kardell</cite>: So, Serenity is currently, has been, anyway, a passion project, basically, for everybody. We want to do it because we believe we can do it, and we want the outcome. This thing where it's not disconnected libraries, but do you see that there are potentials for it to be something more than that? Can you imagine use cases for Serenity that it could be a practical choice, or Ladybird, where people could use it for no other purposes? WebKit is used for lots more than Safari. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: Well, for me personally, with Serenity, I just want to build an operating system that I can use. That was always my goal since day one. And I'm happy to welcome other people into the project with their own goals, who want to adapt it to something they want to do. But for me personally, I just want to make something that I can use as my daily driver. And I have pretty simple needs. I just need a terminal and a browser and an IDE. So, they're reasonably easy to satisfy. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Brian Kardell</cite>: Your videos, you're not using Serenity to do your code and... Are you? </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: Right. I do not, because it is not practical. We don't have the ability to record video and we don't have USB webcam support. And also compile performance is not as good on Serenity as it is on Linux. So I just record on Linux because it's more practical. I tend to be a very pragmatic person in all these things. Honestly, recently I'm focusing way more on just building the browser in a cross-platform environment. And it's still... Everything I work on is still part of the operating system. I've just been swept away with the fun of building a browser that might potentially be useful to more people than just myself. </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Brian Kardell</cite>: Yeah, right. Yeah. Well that's what I was thinking with... The more useful you can make it to more people, it seems that you get more contributions, which then makes it more useful to more people and so on, right? </blockquote></li>
                
                <li>
                  <blockquote><cite>Andreas Kling</cite>: Yeah. And I think it's important to be realistic, and realistically, SerenityOS will never be something that's used by millions of people, at least not with the goals that we currently have for it. And with Ladybird, that's much more of an open question, I think, because it's much harder to tell the future. We have great momentum. We're making great progress, and who knows how long we can keep that rate of progress. What will be the first major roadblock? What kind of problems will we face? Who knows? But it's exciting to run towards it so we can see what's there. </blockquote></li>

<p>It’s a small enough function that gcc and/or clang should be able to optimize it
pretty well. Maybe optimally? I initially wrote this to see whether gcc produced
a jump table or a search.</p>

<p>GCC spat out a little more code, that ran a little faster (not much).</p>
<p>This code is pretty straightforward, it has three conditional branch
instructions (je, je, jne), leading to four possible blocks, ‘\0’, ’s’, ‘p’, and
a block for any other character.</p>
<h2 id="rearranging-branches"><a href="#rearranging-branches"><span>#&nbsp;</span>Rearranging branches</a></h2>
<p>However, we know some things about this loop. We know that the only time we
break out of it is when we hit the null terminator (’\0’). The code clang
generates checks for the null terminator first, but this makes no sense. The
maximum number of null terminators we will ever hit in this function is 1, so
for every ‘p’ and ’s’ character, we’re checking for null first. We should
optimize for ‘p’s, ’s’s and other characters over null terminators.</p>
<p>So, let’s rearrange this loop a little.</p>

<p>So both of our common cases (‘p’ and ’s’) jump back to the top of the loop,
so why don’t we remove one of those branches by putting its target block (or
BasicBlock™, for people in compiler land), at the top of the loop?</p>

<p>Great, now our ’s’ block falls through into the loop without a branch. Pretty
sweet.</p>
<p>You’ll notice that we now have to jump into the loop from the function start,
to avoid running the ’s’ block. This is a pretty good tradeoff though, jumping
into the loop from the function start happens once, whereas we encounter many
’s’ characters.</p>
<p>But is it fast?</p>

<p>Well, we got rid of another branch instruction, using basic arithmetic. Good for
us. Is it faster though?</p>

<p><strong>Overall speedup:</strong>: 1.12x 📈</p>
<p><strong>Bitrate</strong>: 332.29MiB/s</p>
<p>Fun fact, we’ve been comparing our performance to clang 16’s output this whole
time, but GCC 12 actually produced faster (but more) code. GCC’s code runs in
2.87s as well, so we only just caught up with it, however our program consists
of 13 instructions, and GCC’s is 19.</p>
<p>GCC’s code seems to have unrolled the loop, and is reusing the case blocks to
some extent.</p>

<p>Wow that removed a lot of arrows from the control flow graph…</p>
<p>Instead of branching/jumping conditionally, we’re using a different value
for the addition depending on the current character, using <code>cmove</code>, or…
✨✨<strong>conditional move on equality</strong>✨✨.</p>
<p>The rules are: by default use zero, if we’re on an ’s’, use 1, and if we’re on a
‘p’, use -1. Then <strong>always</strong> add.</p>
<p>Right, nice flex, but… Is it fast?</p>
<p><strong>Runtime:</strong> 0.48s 🐆</p>

<p>Yes it’s pretty damn fast.</p>

<p>… But is it fast?</p>
<p><strong>Runtime:</strong> 0.51s 🦁</p>
<p><strong>Overall speedup:</strong>: 6.33x 📈</p>
<p><strong>Bitrate</strong>: 1.83GiB/s</p>
<p>Well, that’s slower than using <code>cmov</code>s. I guess there are no points for using
less registers, or for using 8-bit operations instead of 32-bit ones…</p>
<h2 id="other-attempts"><a href="#other-attempts"><span>#&nbsp;</span>Other attempts</a></h2>
<p>I tried unrolling the loop of our best version. This slowed down the code.</p>
<p>I tried aligning the start of the loop to a 16-byte boundary (pro tip, you
can add <code>.align &lt;bytes&gt;</code> before a label, and GNU assembler will insert <code>nop</code>
instructions for you). This also slowed down the code.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The C versions were compiled with <code>-march=native</code>, so that the C compiler knew
to produce code that was fast on <strong>my specific</strong> CPU, not some generic x86_64.</p>
<p>The benchmark runs the function over a list of one million characters (random
‘p’s and ’s’s) one thousand times.</p>
<p>For each version, the benchmark was run several times, and the best result
chosen.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion"><span>#&nbsp;</span>Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>You can (sometimes) get a 6x speedup by hand-coding your tight C loop in
assembly, and optimizing using techniques that compilers don’t seem to have
automated away yet.</p>
<p>Of course, this post isn’t the end. If this still isn’t fast enough for you,
you can read <a href="https://owen.cafe/posts/the-same-speed-as-c/">part two</a>.</p>
