  <p>In 2000, Douglas Adams made an interesting observation that I keep returning to.</p>
<p>A user on Slashdot named “FascDot Killed My Pr” had asked the following question (where HGttG = Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Comedy….or Tragedy?</em></p>
<p><em>First, a big thank-you. You’ve made a lasting contribution to “our” culture (or should that be “culture”?)</em></p>
<p><em>I first read HGttG in my early teens. I doubled over laughing the whole time. I read and reread the entire series, bought both Dirk Gently books AND Last Chance to See. Loved them all and wouldn’t trade having read them for anything. (btw, the first mental ward scene in Long Dark Teatime is a no-foolin’, all-time classic.)</em></p>
<p><em>However, a few years ago I was talking to a (then) classmate. Very smart, philosophy-major type. He said (paraphrased) “I thought that HGttG was depressing. Such nihilism.” At the time I thought “Hmmm…I didn’t SEE a black beret on his head….”. But every reading of the series since then his comment has struck me as more true–especially in the case of Arthur Dent. In fact, far from being funny, I now find Dent’s character depressing–he’s not just a loser, he literally has no control over his life at all (except in So Long for a while). And the control he does have does him no good (e.g. Earth is destroyed while he’s trying to save his house.)</em></p>
<p><em>So my question is: When you were writing these books did you feel you were being gaily whimsical or did you instead feel frustrated and cynical?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Douglas Adams replied with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I suspect there is a cultural divide at work here. In England our heroes tend to be characters who either have, or come to realise that they have, no control over their lives whatsoever – Pilgrim, Gulliver, Hamlet, Paul Pennyfeather (from Decline and Fall), Tony Last (from A Handful of Dust). We celebrate our defeats and our withdrawals – the Battle of Hastings, Dunkirk, almost any given test match. There was a wonderful book published, oh, about twenty years ago I think, by Stephen Pile called the Book of Heroic Failures. It was staggeringly huge bestseller in England and sank with heroic lack of trace in the U.S. Stephen explained this to me by saying that you cannot make jokes about failure in the States. It’s like cancer, it just isn’t funny at any level. In England, though, for some reason it’s the thing we love most. So Arthur may not seem like much of a hero to Americans – he doesn’t have any stock options, he doesn’t have anything to exchange high fives about round the water-cooler. But to the English, he is a hero. Terrible things happen to him, he complains about it a bit quite articulately, so we can really feel it along with him - then calms down and has a cup of tea. My kind of guy!</p>
<p>I’ve hit a certain amount of difficulty over the years in explaining this in Hollywood. I’m often asked ‘Yes, but what are his goals?’ to which I can only respond, well, I think he’d just like all this to stop, really. It’s been a hard sell. I rather miss David Vogel from the film process. He’s the studio executive at Disney who was in charge of the project for a while, but has since departed. There was a big meeting at one time to discuss, amongst other things, Arthur’s heroicness or lack of it. David suddenly asked me ‘Does Arthur’s presence in the proceedings make a difference to the way things turn out?’ to which I said, slightly puzzled, ‘Well, yes.’ David smiled and said ‘Good. Then he’s a hero.’</p>
<p>In the current, latest version of the screenplay, I think that Arthur’s non-heroic heroism is now absolutely preserved, and I’m pleased with the way he works out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(<a href="https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/00/06/21/1217242/douglas-adams-answers-finally">Douglas Adams Answers (Finally) - Slashdot</a>)</p>
<p>I think I have more to say about this, and will try to come back and add more here, but meanwhile a few things at random:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As a matter of fact, I <em>have</em> read <em>The Book of Heroic Failures</em> (1979) with great enjoyment. (<a href="https://shreevatsa.wordpress.com/2011/03/21/the-book-of-heroic-failures/">Post from 2011</a> —&nbsp;I only wrote four sentences of my own, but one of them was “Too many books have been written in praise of competence; this book provides an antidote by celebrating failure as only a British author can.”)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think he is right that this goes over better (generally speaking) in England than in the USA. Of course one can make jokes <em>mocking</em> failure, but someone who fails does not automatically become endearing (in a kind of everyman way) in America the way they would in England. It seems to me that Americans are more likely to feel either contempt or pity than to feel kinship: or at any rate, they regard the failure as a setback or interesting circumstance, rather than the natural/default state of the world. (As someone who is neither American nor English, I am of course not someone whose opinions you should pay any heed to.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As we live our lives, are we merely victims subject to winds of chance and external circumstance, or are we powerful agents fashioning our own stories, making our own luck? Obviously the answer is “both”, but perhaps the most distinctively American trait is to lean more towards the latter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Can you think that following a design thinking process with five steps turns you into a creative innovator?! Believe me, it isn’t and never has been this way. The spread of the term design thinking is aligned with a significant amount of misleading criticism. The doubts about the effectiveness of design thinking are influenced by the promotional language used by some companies, training places, and public speakers. The truth is that there is no secret recipe to turn someone into a creative designer. Yet, there is a way to use the design expertise inside each of us. <a href="https://www.designorate.com/design-thinking-guide-what-why-how/">Understanding the design thinking core values</a> can help team members improve their design ability and appreciate the creative practice inside the organization to achieve the next competitive advantage. This is why I wanted to share with you those key design thinking books to learn the core principles underpinning the design practice.</p>



<p>This is an updated list of design thinking books that I keep adding to their new book suggestions. So, please keep the link or subscribe to the newsletters to receive updates once new books are added. I am also starting to add papers that represent the cornerstone in the design thinking principles that I believe are as important as the book. In this update, two books and one paper added: The Science of Artificial, Wicked Problems in Design Thinking, and How Designers Think.</p>



<p>Previously, we explored different challenges that can be faced when applying design thinking inside the organization ( Why Companies Need to Apply Design Thinking and Why Companies Need to Apply Design Thinking). The majority of these factors rely on the lack of understanding of the core value of design thinking, which can be a reason for over-promotion and misuse of a commercialized language (check <a href="https://www.designorate.com/why-design-thinking-doesnt-work/" rel="bookmark">Why Design Thinking Doesn’t Work</a>). Above all, many design thinking trainers are not designers themselves and never practice the creative practice before teaching it which causes the gap between classrooms and practices.</p>

<p>To expand my knowledge of the core values behind design thinking, I thought I would share with you some of the book titles that highlight design characteristics. Each of these books explores design from a specific perspective. Learning about these design aspects is essential for both designers and non-designers before jumping to learn design thinking. While there are several books about design thinking toolkits, the books below don’t teach you to design thinking methodology but the core principles behind design thinking to develop new alternatives of ideas and improve the analytical thinking of problems and solutions. They aim to guide you in understanding the core values and practices of design as a collaborative process. By acquiring this knowledge, you can effectively apply any of the design thinking processes we discussed earlier in previous articles with effectiveness. I am sure that those are not the only books out there, so please share with us your book suggestions in the comments below the article.</p>

<h3><span id="Design_Expertise_by_Kees_Dorst"></span>Design Expertise by Kees Dorst<span></span></h3>



<p>The <a href="https://amzn.to/34vj2Fj">Design Expertise</a>, written by Lawson and Dorst, focuses on the understanding of design practice in the creative industry. The book aims to explore the nature of design from a practitioner’s perspective. It starts by exploring the different definitions of design and how they contributed to identifying the border of the discipline of design.</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://www.designorate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Design-Expertise.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="800" height="500" src="https://www.designorate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Design-Expertise.jpg" alt="Design Expertise" srcset="https://www.designorate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Design-Expertise.jpg 800w, https://www.designorate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Design-Expertise-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.designorate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Design-Expertise-768x480.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a><figcaption>Design Expertise by Kees Dorst</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The book presents design work for different designers and tries to use this overview of their work to provide a practical example of design characteristics. This book provides you with a base idea about design, what it is, and its characteristics. Exploring the characteristics through <a href="https://www.designorate.com/design-thinking-reshaped-microsoft-products/">design thinking case studies</a>, and examples helps you see design’s core value. This value is the main cornerstone behind the application of the design thinking process.</p>



<h3><span id="Frame_Innovation_by_Kees_Dorst"></span>Frame Innovation by Kees Dorst<span></span></h3>



<p>One of the main design characteristics is to solve problems or move from one position to an improved one. However, this can’t be achieved without a clear idea of the problem and its different borders. In his book <a href="https://amzn.to/2yPd9a9">Frame Innovation</a>, Dorst explores the cognitive design process’s problem and solution frames. Also, he explores how designers move from one frame to another and how this feedback process contributes toward an optimum solution for wicked problems.</p>

<p>Many of the design thinking process models move from the exploration stage (divergent) to defining the solution (conversion). While this practice shares the principle of critical thinking, they all move between the problem frame and solution frame. Through this book, you will explore the principles and practices of problem/solution frames to develop creative potential ideas.</p>



<p>The book extends discussion of of the principle of frame innovation by covering the opportunities and challenges related to its application in creative industries. The book ends by putting a practice action plan to move toward using the frame innovation in different business models.</p>



<h3><span id="Design_Thinking_Understanding_How_Designers_Think_and_Work"></span>Design Thinking: Understanding How Designers Think and Work<span></span></h3>



<p>In this small yet informative book, <a href="https://amzn.to/2RwszqB">Design Thinking</a>, Nigel Cross explores how designers think and reach creative ideas in the design field and the nature of design from the perspective of idea formation. To this goal, the book overviews design practice based on observing and interviewing creative designers and exploring expert tips with them. Design processes try to explore the design expertise from creating the idea to applying it. However, the design ability comes earlier when ideas are formulated. The book’s first chapter explores this design ability and how each of us has a level of design ability to develop new ideas. Yet, some people are more designers than others, which is known in Lusy Kimbel’s two papers as the creative class (Rethinking Design Thinking: <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2752/175470811X13071166525216?casa_token=eQlFFIjY110AAAAA:8TLvc0-_HjZPsM0NbT1y3lya4XulQVlfc-4f0uPelIYFwHjyJK53Aj-33_yvdsFKgxfy1EdeRbUNXw">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2752/175470812X13281948975413?casa_token=Vlf9CU0l2A4AAAAA:pFFp0YVRmEZdRBbNDR2EWVin0DkNV72L6SaSIHgx7TnHKbC8ZqDdPC8Yvm1TNQtPsJIt6z65m9pxyg">Part 2</a>).</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://www.designorate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Design-Thinking.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="500" src="https://www.designorate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Design-Thinking.jpg" alt="Design Thinking: Understanding How Designers Think and Work" srcset="https://www.designorate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Design-Thinking.jpg 800w, https://www.designorate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Design-Thinking-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.designorate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Design-Thinking-768x480.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a><figcaption>Design Thinking: Understanding How Designers Think and Work by Nigel Cross</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The book overviews designers’ practice in different fields and stories. The aim of this overview through creative designers’ experience is to build an understanding of the inspiration or exploration stage in the design thinking process. For instance, what is brainstorming, and why is it applied at an early point in the design thinking process (How to Successfully Apply Inspiration in Design Thinking)? Linking similar questions to the practice helps you map your practice to rational reasoning and subsequently improves the progress of the process in the future.</p>



<h3><span id="Change_by_Design_by_Tim_Brown"></span>Change by Design by Tim Brown<span></span></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Change-Design-Revised-Updated-Organizations/dp/0062856626/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1680977260&amp;sr=8-10">Change by Design</a>, by Tim Bowen, CEO of the IDEO, is probably one of the commonly known books about design thinking because of the popularity of the IDEO in the application of design thinking in various social innovation contexts. In his book, Tim Brown manifests his ideology about design thinking and interprets it from the organisational perspective. The book aims to clarify what design thinking is, and where to go from theory to practice. In the first part, the books focus on the main concepts of design thinking (check Design Thinking Tools and Methods Complete Guide), such as extending behind the aesthetics, shifting toward a human-centred approach (i.e. improving customer experience and building inclusive design), the power of prototyping, and the importance of storytelling. The second part of the book aims to interpret these principles for practicality to identify the business opportunities for design thinking and the use of design to achieve innovation inside organisations through creative collaboration between stakeholders.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>The book is a good resource for both designers and business people to understand design thinking and its applications. Despite several criticisms of the IDEO design thinking model, the book describes the theoretical base of design thinking, which could have a positive, innovative impact on organisations, especially if applied properly to develop viable business strategies. The <a href="http://www.designkit.org/">IDEO Field Guide</a> can be a good companion for the book as it presents a toolbox to apply Tim Brown’s ideology in practice.</p>



<h3><span id="The_Design_of_Everyday_Things_by_Don_Norman"></span>The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman<span></span></h3>



<p>Don Norman is one of the leading professors in behaviour psychology and human-computer interaction (HCI). His book, <a href="https://amzn.to/2Rx5XGb">The Design of Everyday Things</a>, is based on a simple observation: why do we love and hate some elements in our lives? And what is the psychology behind our behaviour toward products? Addressing these two questions presents a cornerstone of your design practice. For example, why do some people love products such as Apple, <a href="https://www.designorate.com/what-is-market-segmentation-and-why-designers-should-understand/">Mini Cooper</a>, or <a href="https://www.designorate.com/ikea-sustainable-design-strategy/">IKEA</a>? By understanding how consumers love or hate products, the design team can target these features to build an empathic relationship between the product (or service) and the client, known as <a href="https://www.designorate.com/empathic-design-approach-to-successful-design/">emphatic design</a>.</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://www.designorate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Everyday-Things.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="500" src="https://www.designorate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Everyday-Things.jpg" alt="The Design of Everyday Things " srcset="https://www.designorate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Everyday-Things.jpg 800w, https://www.designorate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Everyday-Things-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.designorate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Everyday-Things-768x480.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a><figcaption>The Design of Everyday Things for Don Norman</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The book explores human-centred design and its impact on usability interaction design principles, as well as user experience. While other books covered this aspect of design experience, Norman studied the experience from a psychological point of view to examine this complex design process. The book covers the psychology behind our daily actions, knowledge, design limitations, and human error. Later, the book explores design thinking as a tool to solve problems and the usage of the Design Council Double Diamond design thinking process. The book is not only for UX designers but for designers from different practices, as you can learn the following:</p>



<ol>
<li>How the brain works and the psychology related to products and services,</li>



<li>The limitations related to our experience with interacting with designs around and</li>



<li>Human error and a bad design causes .</li>
</ol>



<h3><span id="How_Designers_Think_by_Bryan_Lawson"></span>How Designers Think? by Bryan Lawson<span></span></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Designers-Think-Process-Demystified/dp/0750660775/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1701980560&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">How Designers Think?</a> by Bryan Lawson is one of the design thinking books I recommend for my students who are still new to problem-solving and understanding the philosophical approach underpinning the problem and solution space in the design thinking process, How Designer Think for Bryan Lawson overviews the design definition, the relation between problem and solutions and the design thinking process. </p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="624" src="https://www.designorate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/HowDesigersThink-1-1024x624.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.designorate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/HowDesigersThink-1-1024x624.jpg 1024w, https://www.designorate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/HowDesigersThink-1-300x183.jpg 300w, https://www.designorate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/HowDesigersThink-1-768x468.jpg 768w, https://www.designorate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/HowDesigersThink-1.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>How Designers Think? by Bryan Lawson</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Unlike other books, Lawson doesn’t aim to teach you his method or derive a specific point; it is more like a discussion book to allow you to reflect and synthesise on the design practice and finally come up with your conclusion. The book presents a flow of ideas as a case study, making it easy to understand and enjoyable for new readers in design thinking. I recommend reading it before moving to more advanced books such as The Science of Artificial.</p>



<h2><span id="The_Science_of_Artificial_by_Herbert_Simon"></span>The Science of Artificial by Herbert Simon <span></span></h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sciences-Artificial-MIT-Press/dp/0262691914" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Science of Artificial </a>is one of Simon’s most famous and irritating works based on three lectures for him at MIT in 1968, a year before the book was first published. The book discusses the nature of human thinking and the “artefact.” In eight chapters, it explores how humans use artefacts to solve everyday problems. His expression of human rationale is expressed with three premises:</p>



<ul>
<li>The limitations in the human’s cognitive ability</li>



<li>The time available to make a decision, and</li>



<li>The complexity of the problem</li>
</ul>



<p>Based on these three premises, he concluded that we are under the illusion that we can choose the optimal solution for problems. Instead, we find a way to determine the reasonable solutions (check <a href="https://www.designorate.com/the-six-hats-of-critical-thinking-and-how-to-use-them/">What Are The Six Thinking Hats?

<p>Simon was awarded a Nobel Prize for his theory and its contribution to economic rationality. According to the above theory, Simon defined three problem-solving activities: the ability to conduct a heuristic search for alternatives, evaluate solutions, and allocate resources for search. He illustrates this concept in his statement:</p>



<p><em>” Human problem solving involves nothing more than varying mixtures of trial and error and selectivity. The selectivity derives from various rules of thumb, or heuristics, suggesting which paths should be tried first and which promising leads.”</em></p>



<h2><span id="Wicked_Problems_in_Design_Thinking_Paper_by_Richard_Buchanan"></span>Wicked Problems in Design Thinking (Paper) by Richard Buchanan<span></span></h2>



<p><a href="https://web.mit.edu/jrankin/www/engin_as_lib_art/Design_thinking.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wicked Problems in Design Thinking</a> by Buchanan was published in Design Studies in 1992. Buchanan linked design and analytical philosophy by understanding the design problem’s nature and elements. He discussed two terms: “category” and “placement”, where we frame the different aspects of the problem. Buchanan describes them as follows:</p>



<p><em>“Understanding the difference between a category and a placement is essential if design thinking is to be regarded as more than a series of creative accidents. Categories have fixed meanings that are accepted within the framework of a theory or a philosophy and serve as the basis for analysing what already exists. Placements have boundaries to shape and constrain meaning but are not rigidly fixed and determinate. The boundary of placement gives a context or orientation to thinking, but the application to a specific situation can generate a new perception of that situation and, hence, a new possibility to be tested. Therefore, placements are sources of new ideas and possibilities when applied to problems in concrete circumstances.”</em></p>

<p>The expandable nature of the “placement” presents a critical element of wicked problems and how we can see them as a universal concept whose boundaries can change based on the situation. This manifestation of the definition of the problem elements presented the cornerstone for Kees Dorst’s problem/solution frame discussed in the earlier book Frame Innovation (<a href="https://www.designorate.com/8d-problem-solving-approach/">What is the 8D Problem-Solving?&nbsp;</a>).</p>



<p>His ideas of wicked problems link with Simon’s concept about the design thinking process and how it can be seen as a non-linear process where different design ideas interact in the design arena. Also, In this placement, Buchanan differentiated between four elements of the design thinking process:</p>



<ul>
<li>Signs: material objects</li>



<li>Things: actions</li>



<li>Thoughts: complex systems or environments, which is a weird characterisation.</li>
</ul>



<p>As he links the above elements and the two terms described earlier (category vs placement), he describes the nature of wicked problems:<br><em>“However, when a designer’s conceptual placements become categories of thinking, the result can be mannered imitations of an earlier invention that are no longer relevant to discovering specific possibilities in a new situation. Ideas are then forced onto a situation rather than discovered in the particularities and novel possibilities of that situation.”</em></p>



<p>The above manifestation describes how wicked problems are constructed and change over time, paving the way for a new perspective on problems and their analysis to identify new solutions (check also <a href="https://www.designorate.com/practice-guide-to-solve-problems-with-triz/">How to Use TRIZ in the Problem-Solving Process</a>).</p>



<h2><span id="The_Dilemmas_in_a_General_Theory_of_Planning_by_Rittel_and_Webber"></span>The Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning by Rittel and Webber<span></span></h2>



<p><a href="https://web.mit.edu/jrankin/www/engin_as_lib_art/Design_thinking.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning</a> by Rittel and Webber, despite its age, remains a seminal work that has significantly influenced the understanding of wicked problems. Published in 1969, this paper laid the groundwork for Kees Dorst’s Frame Innovation and Buchanan’s Wicked Problems,&nbsp;both of&nbsp;which we’ve discussed. While the&nbsp;paper’s focus is&nbsp;on planning and policy science,&nbsp;its insights can be applied&nbsp;to problem definition and the process of solving them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rittel and Webber distinguished between two types of problems: tame and wicked problems. Tame problems are well-defined and clearly stated, and there is a clear direction to finding the solution, such as scientific and business problems (check how this concept influenced <a href="https://www.designorate.com/practice-guide-to-solve-problems-with-triz/">TRIZ problem-solving</a>). In contrast, wicked problems are ill-defined, and we can’t define the problem until we reach a solution. However, a wicked problem is never solved, yet it moves from one state to an improved,&nbsp;desirable&nbsp;one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other nature of wicked problems is that we cannot reach a definitive formulation for them. To describe them, we need to develop an exhaustive inventory of conceivable solutions when asking questions about the problem. So, problem understanding and resolution are linked and change as we build an understanding of the problem at a particular moment in time.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><span id="The_New_Process_New_Vocabulary_Axiofact_A_tefact_Memoranda_by_Gilbert_Cockton"></span>The New Process, New Vocabulary: Axiofact = A_tefact + Memoranda by Gilbert Cockton<span></span></h2>



<p>As you can see, the above books and papers give us a novel look at design problems and how we perceive them. My question is, why do we see problems the way we used to? A big part of the answer lies in our language, which presents mental models that stand as barriers to seeing the core nature of problems, especially the wicked ones. Therefore, we needed new vocabulary that helped us to escape these constraints. <a href="http://library.usc.edu.ph/ACM/CHI%202017/2exab/ea747.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New Process, New Vocabulary: Axiofact = A_tefact + Memoranda</a>, by my PhD supervisor, Professor Gilbert Cockton, presents a cornerstone of new vocabularies that can help us see design thinking and how to solve problems.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="599" src="https://www.designorate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Cockton-1024x599.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.designorate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Cockton-1024x599.jpg 1024w, https://www.designorate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Cockton-300x176.jpg 300w, https://www.designorate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Cockton-768x449.jpg 768w, https://www.designorate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Cockton.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The paper eliminated the so-called design thinking process, as the term employs a linear nature; while design thinking is far from linear, it is intersected activities. Cockton described the design practice as design arenas; these arenas are distinguishing “artefacts” and “memoranda.” The “artefact” represents the design outcome, and the “memoranda” is the thing to be borne in mind. This new terminology replaces the problem and solution spaces. However, the Latin root of an artefact means the product of change or doing some art. However, this term is limited as wicked problems are not understood until we solve them, which means artefacts. So, the outcome of the design arena may remain the same as the original state, or the change is against the target user, such as preventive design and design against crime. So, Cockton replaced the word artefact with A_tefact.&nbsp; The memoranda consist of three arenas:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Beneficiaries</strong>: The purpose of design</li>



<li><strong>Purposes</strong>: The Artefact and Evaluation</li>



<li><strong>Evaluations</strong>: Modifications to the Artefact</li>
</ul>

Recreated from Cockton (2017).</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Other terms were also introduced in the paper, such as episodes to replace stages (or phases) that are inherited from linear process age. The multiple foci (sequence by concurrency) replaced the centre of the process term to indicate the complex nature of the iteration with no simple way to describe it. The term “iteration” is replaced with balanced concurrent drama, and validation is replaced with the term “axiofact,” or the value generated. The new terminology presented in Cockton’s paper allows us to escape the old mental model when addressing wicked problems.&nbsp;If you check the <a href="https://www.designorate.com/using-the-mppf-method-in-the-double-diamond-design-process/">MPPF method in Design Thinking</a>, which we discussed previously, you will find it&nbsp;a&nbsp;useful&nbsp;tool&nbsp;as it can help us address wicked problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each of the above books and papers focuses on specific aspects of design and how we observe the design thinking practice driven by feedback from both academia and industry. The different design thinking models are based on appreciating these characteristics of design and encouraging it inside the organization. By applying the steps alone, you will never reach any improved status. You need to recognize these characteristics of design and try to practice them during the design process. Again, the above books came to my mind as key books in design. I am sure there are other titles. So, please share it in the comments below.</p>

                    <p>FORTAZELA, Brazil — In this historic city by the sea in northeast Brazil, burn patients look as if they've emerged from the waves. They are covered in fish skin — specifically strips of sterilized tilapia.</p>
<p>Doctors here are testing the skin of the popular fish as a bandage for second- and third-degree burns. The innovation arose from an unmet need. Animal skin has long been used in the treatment of burns in developed countries. But Brazil lacks the human skin, pig skin, and artificial alternatives that are widely available in the US.</p>
<p>The three functional skin banks in Brazil can meet only 1 percent of the national demand, said Dr. Edmar Maciel, a plastic surgeon and burn specialist leading the clinical trials with tilapia skin.</p>
<p>As a result, public health patients in Brazil are normally bandaged with gauze and silver sulfadiazine cream.</p>
<p>"It's a burn cream because there's silver in it, so it prevents the burns from being infected," said Dr. Jeanne Lee, interim burn director at the the regional burn center at the University of California at San Diego. "But it doesn't help in terms of debriding a burn or necessarily helping it heal."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2017/03/01/sweat-burn-patients-skin-grafts/" target="_blank"><strong>READ MORE: First Look: Plumbing the mysteries of sweat to help burn patients cool their skin</strong></a></p>
<p>The gauze-and-cream dressing must be changed every day, a painful process. In the burn unit at Fortaleza's José Frota Institute, patients contort as their wounds are unwrapped and washed.</p>
<p>Enter the humble tilapia, a fish that's widely farmed in Brazil and whose skin, until now, was considered trash. Unlike the gauze bandages, the sterilized tilapia skin goes on and stays on.</p>
<p>The first step in the research process was to analyze the fish skin.</p>
<p>"We got a great surprise when we saw that the amount of collagen proteins, types 1 and 3, which are very important for scarring, exist in large quantities in tilapia skin, even more than in human skin and other skins," Maciel said. "Another factor we discovered is that the amount of tension, of resistance in tilapia skin is much greater than in human skin. Also the amount of moisture."</p>
<p>In patients with superficial second-degree burns, the doctors apply the fish skin and leave it until the patient scars naturally. For deep second-degree burns, the tilapia bandages must be changed a few times over several weeks of treatment, but still far less often than the gauze with cream. The tilapia treatment also cuts down healing time by up to several days and reduces the use of pain medication, Maciel said.</p>
<p>Antônio dos Santos, a fisherman, was offered the tilapia treatment as part of a clinical trial after he sustained burns to his entire right arm when a gas canister on his boat exploded. He accepted.</p>
<p>"After they put on the tilapia skin, it really relieved the pain," he said. "I thought it was really interesting that something like this could work."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2015/11/11/thermoplastic-bandage/" target="_blank"><strong>READ MORE: High-tech bandage wins $100K from Boston Marathon bombing survivor's family</strong></a></p>
<p>The initial batches of tilapia skin were studied and prepared by a team of researchers at the Federal University of Ceará. Lab technicians used various sterilizing agents, then sent the skins for radiation in São Paulo to kill viruses, before packaging and refrigerating the skins. Once cleaned and treated, they can last for up to two years.</p>
<p>In the US, animal-based skin substitutes require levels of scrutiny from the Food and Drug Administration and animal rights groups that can drive up costs, Lee said. Given the substantial supply of donated human skin, tilapia skin is unlikely to arrive at American hospitals anytime soon.</p>
<p>But it may be a boon in developing countries.</p>
<p>"I'm willing to use anything that might actually help a patient," Lee said. "It may be a good option depending on what country you're talking about. But I also think the problem is that you need to find places that have the resources to actually process the skin and sterilize it, and make sure it doesn't have diseases."</p>
<p>In Brazil, in addition to the clinical trials, researchers are currently conducting histological studies that compare the composition of human, tilapia, pig, and frog skins. They are also conducting studies on the comparative costs of tilapia skin and conventional burn treatments. If clinical trials show continued success, doctors hope a company will process the skins on an industrial scale and sell it to the public health system.</p>

and farm-wide costs like equipment, land and management are combined, costs vary widely by crop. In 2025, forecasted total per-acre costs are $1,308 for rice, $1,166 for peanuts, $943 for cotton, $890 for corn, $658 for soybeans, $498 for oats, $491 for barley, $443 for sorghum, and $396 for wheat. Looking ahead, ERS projections for 2026 suggest continued upward pressure across most cost categories, with total cost increasing anywhere from 2.2% to 3.3%. Amongst the nine principal crops, wheat ($409 per acre), sorghum ($458) and oats ($513) remain at the lower end of the production cost spectrum, while soybeans ($678) and barley ($507) fall in the mid-range in 2026. Cotton ($965), peanuts ($1,194) and rice ($1,336) remain the most expensive crops to produce on a per-acre basis. </p><p>Operating costs—expenses directly tied to producing a yearly crop, such as seed, fertilizer, chemicals, fuel and labor—substantially vary across crops. In 2025, total operating costs ranged from $155 per acre for wheat to more than $764 per acre for rice and $631 per acre for peanuts. In 2026, these costs are expected to rise, ranging from $774 per acre for rice and $160 per acre for wheat. While select inputs have moderated slightly from recent peaks, overall operating expenses remain well above pre-2021 levels. Rising costs since 2020 have been driven primarily by sharp increases in interest expenses (+71%), fertilizer (+37%), fuel and oil (+32%), labor (+47%), chemicals (+25%) and maintenance (+27%), alongside notable gains in seed (+18%) and marketing costs (+18%). </p></div><!-- /margin and padding --><div><!-- width wrap --><figure><a href="https://www.fb.org/imgz/Slide8.PNG"

href="https://www.fb.org/market-intel/emergency-commodity-assistance-program-ecap-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Emergency Commodity Assistance Program (ECAP)</a> provide important near-term support. However, ECAP was designed to address 2023 and 2024 losses, rather than 2025 and later production challenges. For both programs, payments are calculated on a per-acre basis. However, when compared to current per-acre production costs and weak commodity prices, these payments generally cover only a share of losses rather than restore profitability. In fact, returns over total costs for all nine principal row crops are projected to remain negative on a per-acre basis even after accounting for federal assistance. Based on loss calculations used in the Farmer Bridge Assistance Program, rice producers face losses of roughly $210 per acre, followed by cotton ($202), oats ($159), peanuts ($131), sorghum ($91), corn ($87), wheat ($70), soybeans ($61) and barley ($42). In total, net losses across the sector are estimated to exceed $50 billion over the past three crop years.</p><!-- /margin and padding --><div><!-- width wrap --><figure><a

erosion of working capital but does not fully offset negative margins. As a result, producers continue to absorb multiyear losses that strain balance sheets, tighten cash flow and complicate access to operating credit. These loss estimates reflect national averages; actual costs of production and returns vary by region, management decisions and ownership structure. For example, producers who own their farmland may face lower total costs by avoiding cash rental expenses, resulting in higher returns.</p><!-- /margin and padding --><!-- /margin --><div id="loop10"><p><strong>Specialty Crops<br></strong><br>Additionally, neither the FBA program nor the ECAP <a href="https://www.fb.org/market-intel/specialty-crops-need-economic-aid-case-studies-almonds-apples-blueberries-lettuce-potatoes-and-strawberries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">address losses in the specialty crops</a> market. The 2024 <a href="https://www.fb.org/market-intel/marketing-assistance-for-specialty-crops-a-closer-look" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marketing Assistance for Specialty Crop Program (MASC)</a> provided a first but limited relief step for growers and, for many, represented some of the first federal assistance tied to market challenges in the sector. Specialty crop growers continue to face deep and persistent economic losses driven by rising input costs, tightening margins, weather and disease disruptions, labor expenses and constraints, and global trade instability — challenges shared by field crop agriculture, including producers of crops beyond the nine principal crops, such as <a href="https://www.fb.org/market-intel/alfalfa-in-the-red-rising-costs-falling-returns" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alfalfa</a> and sugar beets. Strengthening support for all sectors of agriculture is an economic necessity. Doing so will help maintain a resilient, accessible and diverse U.S. food system. </p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>ERS cost projections make clear that input costs for all of the nine principal row crops remain elevated and sticky. Continued increases in both operating and overhead expenses are pushing breakeven prices higher, while commodity prices remain insufficient to offset those costs for many producers. </p></div><!--

<p><em>Signed by a group of 21 computer scientists expert in election security</em></p>



<h2>Executive summary</h2>



<p>Scientists have understood for many years that internet voting is insecure and that there is no known or foreseeable technology that can make it secure.&nbsp;Still, vendors of internet voting keep claiming that, somehow, their new system is different, or the insecurity doesn’t matter.&nbsp;Bradley Tusk and his Mobile Voting Foundation keep touting internet voting to journalists and election administrators; this whole effort is misleading and dangerous.</p>



<p><strong>Part I. </strong>&nbsp;All internet voting systems are insecure. The insecurity is worse than a well-run conventional paper ballot system, because a very small number of people may have the power to change any (or all) votes that go through the system, without detection. This insecurity has been known for years; every internet voting system yet proposed suffers from it, for basic reasons that cannot be fixed with existing technology.</p>



<p><strong>Part II.&nbsp; </strong>Internet voting systems known as “End-to-End Verifiable Internet Voting” are also insecure, in their own special ways.</p>



<p><strong>Part III.</strong>&nbsp; Recently, Tusk announced an E2E-VIV system called “VoteSecure.”&nbsp; It suffers from all the same insecurities.&nbsp; Even its developers admit that in their development documents.&nbsp; Furthermore, VoteSecure isn’t a complete, usable product, it’s just a “cryptographic core” that someone might someday incorporate into a usable product.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion. </strong>&nbsp;Recent announcements by Bradley Tusks’s Mobile Voting Foundation suggest that the development of VoteSecure somehow makes internet voting safe and appropriate for use in public elections.&nbsp; This is untrue and dangerous.&nbsp; All deployed Internet voting systems are unsafe, VoteSecure is unsafe and isn’t even a deployed voting&nbsp; system, and there is no known (or foreseeable) technology that can make Internet voting safe.</p>



<h2>Part I.&nbsp; All internet voting systems are insecure</h2>



<p>Internet voting systems (including vote-by-smartphone) have three very serious weaknesses:</p>



<ol>
<li>Malware on the voter’s phone (or computer) can transmit different votes than the voter selected and reviewed.&nbsp;Voters use a variety of devices (Android, iPhone, Windows, Mac) which are constantly being attacked by malware.<br></li>



<li>Malware (or insiders) at the server can change votes.&nbsp;Internet servers are constantly being hacked from all over the world, often with serious results.<br></li>



<li>Malware at the county election office can change votes (in those systems where the internet ballots are printed in the county office for scanning).&nbsp;County election computers are not more secure than other government or commercial servers, which are regularly hacked with disastrous results.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<p>Although conventional ballots (marked on paper with a pen) are not perfectly secure either, the problem with internet ballots is the ability for a single attacker (from anywhere in the world) to alter a very large number of ballots with a single scaled-up attack.&nbsp; That’s much harder to do with hand-marked paper ballots; occasionally people try large-scale absentee ballot fraud, typically resulting in their being caught, prosecuted, and convicted.</p>



<h2>Part II.&nbsp; E2E-VIV internet voting systems are also insecure</h2>



<p>Years ago, the concept of “End-to-End Verifiable Internet Voting” (E2E-VIV) was proposed, which was supposed to remedy some of these weaknesses by allowing voters to check that their vote was recorded and counted correctly.&nbsp; Unfortunately, all E2E-VIV systems suffer from one or more of the following weaknesses:</p>



<ol>
<li>Voters must rely on a computer app to do the checking, and the checking app (if infected by malware) could lie to them.<br></li>



<li>Voters should not be able to prove to anyone else how they voted – the technical term is “receipt-free” – otherwise an attacker could build an automated system of mass vote-buying via the internet.&nbsp;But receipt-free E2E-VIV systems are complicated and counterintuitive for people to use.<br></li>



<li>It’s difficult to make an E2E-VIV checking app that’s both trustworthy and receipt-free.&nbsp;The best solutions known allow checking only of votes that will be discarded, and casting of votes that haven’t been checked; this is highly counterintuitive for most voters!&nbsp;<br></li>



<li>The checking app must be separate from the voting app, otherwise it doesn’t add any malware-resistance at all.&nbsp; But human nature being what it is, only a tiny fraction of voters will do the extra steps to run the checking protocol.&nbsp; If hardly anyone uses the checker, then the checker is largely ineffective.<br></li>



<li>Even if some voters do run the checking app, if those voters detect that the system is cheating (which is the purpose of the checking app), there’s no way the voters can prove that to election officials.&nbsp; That is, there is no “dispute resolution” protocol that could effectively work.</li>
</ol>



<p>Thus, the problem with all known E2E-VIV systems proposed to date is that the “verification” part doesn’t add any useful security: if a few percent of voters use the checking protocol and see that the system is sometimes cheating, the system can still steal the votes of all the voters that don’t use the checking protocol.&nbsp;And you might think, “well, if some voters catch the system cheating, then election administrators can take appropriate action”, but no appropriate action is possible: the election administrator can’t cancel the election just because a few voters claim (without proof) that the system is cheating!&nbsp; That’s what it means to have no dispute resolution protocol.</p>



<p>All of this is well understood in the scientific consensus.&nbsp;The insecurity of non-E2E-VIV systems has been documented for decades.&nbsp; For a survey of those results, see “<a href="https://scholars.unh.edu/unh_lr/vol21/iss2/9/">Is Internet Voting Trustworthy? The Science and the Policy Battles</a>”.&nbsp;The lack of dispute resolution in E2E-VIV systems has been <a href="http://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~poorvi/Audiotegrity.pdf">known for many years as well</a>.</p>



<h2>Part III. VoteSecure is insecure</h2>



<p>Bradley Tusk’s <a href="https://www.mobilevoting.org/">Mobile Voting Foundation</a> contracted with the R&amp;D company <a href="https://freeandfair.us/about/">Free and Fair</a> to develop internet voting software.&nbsp;Their <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-mobile-voting-foundation-and-free--fair-release-votesecure-the-first-software-development-kit-for-secure-transparent-and-verifiable-mobile-voting-302615896.html">press release of November 14, 2025</a> announced the release of an <a href="https://github.com/FreeAndFair/VoteSecure">open-source “Software Development Kit”</a> and claimed “This technology milestone means that secure and verifiable mobile voting is within reach.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After <a href="https://github.com/FreeAndFair/VoteSecure/issues/2#issue-3629697747">some computer scientists examined</a> the open-source VoteSecure and <a href="https://blog.citp.princeton.edu/2025/12/16/mobile-voting-projects-vote-by-smartphone-has-real-security-gaps/">described serious flaws in its security</a>, Dr. Joe Kiniry and Dr. Daniel Zimmerman of Free and Fair responded.&nbsp;They say, in effect, that all the critiques are accurate, but they don’t know a way to do any better: “<a href="https://github.com/FreeAndFair/VoteSecure/issues/5#issuecomment-3721078472">We share many of [the critique’s] core goals, including voter confidence, election integrity, and resistance to coercion. Where we differ is not so much in values as in assumptions about what is achievable—and meaningful—in unsupervised voting environments.</a>”</p>



<p>In particular,&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>“<a href="https://github.com/FreeAndFair/VoteSecure/issues/2#issuecomment-3609937648">We make no claim of receipt-freeness.</a>”</li>



<li>“<a href="https://github.com/FreeAndFair/VoteSecure/issues/2#issuecomment-3720432505">Of course, it may be possible for the voter to extract the randomizers from the voting client</a>,” meaning that voters would be able to prove how they voted, for example to someone on the internet who wanted to purchase votes at scale.</li>



<li>“<a href="https://github.com/FreeAndFair/VoteSecure/issues/5#issuecomment-3721078472">We agree that dispute resolution is essential to any <em>complete</em> voting system. We also agree that VoteSecure does not fully specify such a protocol</a>.”&nbsp; But really, the problem is much worse than this admission suggests.&nbsp; No one knows of a protocol that could possibly work.&nbsp; So it’s not a matter of dotting some i’s and crossing some t’s in their specification; it’s a gaping hole (an unsolved, research-level problem).</li>



<li>“​​<a href="https://github.com/FreeAndFair/VoteSecure/issues/5#issuecomment-3721078472">Critique: Malware on the voter’s device can compromise both voting and checking, rendering verification meaningless.&nbsp; Response: This critique is correct—and universal. There is no known technical solution that can fully protect an unsupervised endpoint from a sufficiently capable adversary.</a>”</li>



<li>“<a href="https://github.com/FreeAndFair/VoteSecure/issues/5#issuecomment-3721078472">VoteSecure does not claim to: Advance the state of the art in cryptographic voting protocols beyond existing E2E-VIV research; Eliminate coercion or vote selling in unsupervised elections; [or] Fully specify election administration, dispute resolution, or deployment processes.&nbsp; What VoteSecure aims to do is: Clearly define its threat model . . .</a>”</li>
</ul>







<details><summary>In addition to the previously described flaws in the VoteSecure protocol, we note that its vote checking system is susceptible to mass automated vote-buying attacks<sup>1</sup>; and we have discovered a new flaw in the VoteSecure protocol that allows votes to be stolen<sup>2</sup>.  <em>[click for details]</em></summary>
<details><summary>[1] This conclusion is based on a technical analysis.&nbsp; In the VoteSecure protocol, checking app can be run on a vote that is then cast; the checking app must be runnable on an alternate device than the voting app; that alternate device is likely a PC on which the user has control of installed software; user-installed software can extract decrypted randomizers; this allows the voter to participate in a mass vote-buying scheme.  [2] “<a href="https://github.com/FreeAndFair/VoteSecure/issues/6">Clash attacks on the VoteSecure voting and verification process</a>”, by Vanessa Teague and Olivier Pereira, January 13, 2026.</summary>

</details>
</details>



<p>Based on our own expertise test, and especially in light of the response from Free and Fair, we stand by the original analysis: <a href="https://blog.citp.princeton.edu/2025/12/16/mobile-voting-projects-vote-by-smartphone-has-real-security-gaps/">Mobile Voting Project’s vote-by-smartphone has critical security gaps</a>.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>It has been the scientific consensus for decades that internet voting is not securable by any known technology.&nbsp;Research on future technologies is certainly worth doing.&nbsp;However, the decades of work on E2E-VIV systems has yet to produce any solution, or even any hope of a solution, to the fundamental problems.</p>



<p>Therefore, when it comes to internet voting systems, election officials and journalists should be especially wary of&nbsp;“science by press release.”&nbsp;Perhaps some day an internet voting solution will be proposed that can stand up to scientific investigation.&nbsp;The most reliable venue for assessing that is in peer-reviewed scientific articles.&nbsp;Reputable cybersecurity conferences and journals have published a lot of good science in this area.&nbsp;Press releases are not a reliable way to assess the trustworthiness of election systems.</p>

    <div>
        <p><!--ScriptorStartFragment--><strong>By Thijs Xhaflaire</strong></p> <h2>Introduction</h2> <p>At the end of last year, Jamf Threat Labs published research related to the <a href="https://www.jamf.com/blog/flexibleferret-malware-continues-to-adapt/">Contagious Interview campaign</a>, which has been attributed to a threat actor operating on behalf of North Korea (DPRK). Around the same time, researchers from <a href="https://opensourcemalware.com/blog/contagious-interview-vscode">OpenSourceMalware</a> (OSM) released additional findings that highlighted an evolution in the techniques used during earlier stages of the campaign.</p> <p>Specifically, these newer observations highlight an additional delivery technique alongside the previously documented ClickFix-based techniques. In these cases, the infection chain abuses Microsoft Visual Studio Code task configuration files, allowing malicious payloads to be executed on the victim system.</p> <p>Following the discovery of this technique, both Jamf Threat Labs and OSM continued to closely monitor activity associated with the campaign. In December, Jamf Threat Labs identified additional abuse of Visual Studio Code <code>tasks.json</code> configuration files. This included the introduction of dictionary files containing heavily obfuscated JavaScript, which is executed when a victim opens a malicious repository in Visual Studio Code.</p> <p>Jamf Threat Labs shared these findings with OSM, who subsequently <a href="https://opensourcemalware.com/blog/contagious-interview-malicious-dictionary">published</a> a more in-depth technical analysis of the obfuscated JavaScript and its execution flow.</p> <p>Earlier this week, Jamf Threat Labs identified another evolution in the campaign, uncovering a previously undocumented infection method. This activity involved the deployment of a backdoor implant that provides remote code execution capabilities on the victim system.</p> <p>At a high level, the chain of events for the malware look like so:</p> 
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <p><!--ScriptorStartFragment-->Throughout this blog post we will shed light on each of these steps.</p>  <h2>Initial Infection</h2> <p>In this campaign, infection begins when a victim clones and opens a malicious Git repository, often under the pretext of a recruitment process or technical assignment. The repositories identified in this activity are hosted on either GitHub or GitLab and are opened using Visual Studio Code.</p> <p>When the project is opened, Visual Studio Code prompts the user to trust the repository author. If that trust is granted, the application automatically processes the repository’s <code>tasks.json</code> <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/tasks">configuration file</a>, which can result in embedded arbitrary commands being executed on the system.</p>  
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <p><!--ScriptorStartFragment-->On macOS systems, this results in the execution of a background shell command that uses <code>nohup bash -c</code> in combination with <code>curl -s</code> to retrieve a JavaScript payload remotely and pipe it directly into the Node.js runtime. This allows execution to continue independently if the Visual Studio Code process is terminated, while suppressing all command output.</p> 
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <p><!--ScriptorStartFragment-->In observed cases, the JavaScript payload is hosted on <code>vercel.app</code>, a platform that has been increasingly used in recent <a href="https://opensourcemalware.com/blog/contagious-interview-vscode">DPRK-related activity</a> following a move away from other hosting services, as previously documented by OpenSourceMalware.</p> <p>Jamf Threat Labs reported the identified malicious repository to GitHub, after which the repository was removed. While monitoring the activity prior to takedown, we observed the URL referenced within the repository change on multiple occasions. Notably, one of these changes occurred after the previously referenced payload hosting infrastructure was taken down by Vercel.</p> <h2>The JavaScript Payload</h2> <p>Once execution begins, the JavaScript payload implements the core backdoor logic observed in this activity. While the payload appears lengthy, a significant portion of the code consists of unused functions, redundant logic, and extraneous text that is never invoked during execution <code>(SHA256: 932a67816b10a34d05a2621836cdf7fbf0628bbfdf66ae605c5f23455de1e0bc)</code>. This additional code increases the size and complexity of the script without impacting its observed behavior. It is passed to the node executable as one large argument.</p> <p>Focusing on the functional components, the payload establishes a persistent execution loop that collects basic host information and communicates with a remote command-and-control (C2) server. Hard-coded identifiers are used to track individual infections and manage tasks from the server.</p> <h3>Core backdoor functionality</h3> <p>While the JavaScript payload contains a significant amount of unused code, the backdoor's core functionality is implemented through a small number of routines. These routines provide remote code execution, system fingerprinting, and persistent C2 communication.</p> <p><strong>Remote code execution capability</strong></p> <p>The payload includes a function that enables the execution of arbitrary JavaScript while the backdoor is active. At its core, this is the main functionality of this backdoor.</p> 
    </div>

    

    <div>
        <p><!--ScriptorStartFragment-->This function allows JavaScript code supplied as a string to be dynamically executed over the course of the backdoor lifecycle. By passing the <code>require</code>function into the execution context, attacker-supplied code can import additional Node.js modules allowing additional arbitrary node functions to be executed.</p> <p><strong>System fingerprinting and reconnaissance</strong></p> <p>To profile the infected system, the backdoor collects a small set of host-level identifiers:</p> 
    </div>

    

    <div>
        <p><!--ScriptorStartFragment-->This routine gathers the system hostname, MAC addresses from available network interfaces, and basic operating system details. These values provide a stable fingerprint that can be used to uniquely identify infected hosts and associate them with a specific campaign or operator session.</p> <p>In addition to local host identifiers, the backdoor attempts to determine the victim’s public-facing IP address by querying the external service ipify.org, a technique that has also been observed in prior DPRK-linked campaigns.</p> <p><strong>Command-and-control beaconing and task execution</strong></p> <p>Persistent communication with the C2 server is implemented through a polling routine that periodically sends host information and processes server responses. The beaconing logic is handled by the following function:</p> 
    </div>

    

    <div>
        <p><!--ScriptorStartFragment-->This function periodically sends system fingerprinting data to a remote server and waits for a response. The beacon executes every five seconds, providing frequent interaction opportunities.</p> 
    </div>
    
    <p><!--ScriptorStartFragment-->The server response indicates successful connectivity and allows the backdoor to maintain an active session while awaiting tasking.<!--ScriptorEndFragment--></p>

    

    <div>
        <p><!--ScriptorStartFragment-->If the server response contains a specific status value, the contents of the response message are passed directly to the remote code execution routine, mentioned prior.</p> <h2>Further Execution and Instructions</h2> <p>While monitoring a compromised system, Jamf Threat Labs observed further JavaScript instructions being executed roughly eight minutes after the initial infection. The retrieved JavaScript went on to set up a very similar payload to the same C2 infrustructure.</p> 
    </div>

    

    <div>
        <p><!--ScriptorStartFragment-->Review of this retrieved payload yields a few interesting details...</p> <ol> <li>It beacons to the C2 server every 5 seconds, providing its system details and asks for further JavaScript instructions.</li> <li>It executes that additional JavaScript within a child process.</li> <li>It's capable of shutting itself and child processes down and cleaning up if asked to do so by the attacker.</li> <li>It has inline comments and phrasing that appear to be consistent with AI-assisted code generation.</li> </ol> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>This activity highlights the continued evolution of DPRK-linked threat actors, who consistently adapt their tooling and delivery mechanisms to integrate with legitimate developer workflows. The abuse of Visual Studio Code task configuration files and Node.js execution demonstrates how these techniques continue to evolve alongside commonly used development tools.</p> <p>Jamf Threat Labs will continue to track these developments as threat actors refine their tactics and explore new ways to deliver macOS malware. We strongly recommend that customers ensure Threat Prevention and Advanced Threat Controls are enabled and set to block mode in Jamf for Mac to remain protected against the techniques described in this research.</p> <p>Developers should remain cautious when interacting with third-party repositories, especially those shared directly or originating from unfamiliar sources. Before marking a repository as trusted in Visual Studio Code, it’s important to review its contents. Similarly, "npm install" should only be run on projects that have been vetted, with particular attention paid to package.json files, install scripts, and task configuration files to help avoid unintentionally executing malicious code.</p>  <h2>Indicators or Compromise</h2>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Iran is in the midst of one of the world’s most severe communications blackouts. This post uses Kentik data to detail how this historic event unfolded, where this event lies in the context of previous Iranian shutdowns, and finally discusses what might be in store next for Iran.</p><p>For nearly two weeks, Iran has been enduring one of the most severe internet shutdowns in modern history. The theocratic regime’s decision to restrict communications coincided with a violent nationwide crackdown on a growing protest movement driven by worsening economic hardship.</p>
<p>In this post, I explore the situation in Iran using Kentik’s aggregate NetFlow data, along with other sources.</p>

<p>At the time of this writing, a near-complete internet shutdown has persisted for almost 14 days. Along with internet services, international voice calling has also been blocked (there have been a couple of periods when limited outgoing calls were allowed), and domestic communication services have experienced extended disruptions, including Iran’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Information_Network" rel="noopener" target="_blank">National Information Network</a>. For a country of 90 million people, the combined blocking of these communication modes makes this blackout one of the most severe in history.</p>

<p>To learn more about the conditions that lead to the check out this special episode of Kentik’s <a href="https://www.kentik.com/telemetrynow/">Telemetry Now podcast</a> with Iranian digital rights expert <a href="https://twitter.com/Ammir" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Amir Rashidi</a>, Director of Digital Rights and Security at the human rights organization <a href="https://www.miaan.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Miaan Group</a>:</p>


<p>For decades, the internet of Iran has been connected to the world via two international gateways:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunication_Infrastructure_Company" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Telecommunication Infrastructure Company</a> (TIC) (AS49666, previously AS12880, AS48159)</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Research_in_Fundamental_Sciences" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences</a> (IPM) (AS6736)</li>
</ul>
<p>IPM, primarily a university and research network, was the country’s original internet connection in the 1990s, a story covered in the excellent book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Internet-Elsewhere-Emergent-Effects-Wired-ebook/dp/B005DPJKT4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Internet of Elsewhere</a> by <a href="https://cyrusfarivar.com/blog/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cyrus Farivar</a>. Years later, the state telecom TIC got into the business of providing internet service and today handles the vast majority of internet traffic into and out of Iran.</p>
<p>Despite TIC’s dominance, IPM has maintained a technologically independent connection to the outside world, though it has never been immune from Iranian government censorship and surveillance. This distinction matters because each gateway behaved differently during the shutdown.</p>

<p>In the days leading up to January 8, there were many <a href="https://www.bbc.com/persian/articles/c6207l6m791o" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reports of localized internet blockages</a> around the country, but these incidents weren’t big enough to register on any of our national traffic statistics for Iran.</p>
<p>The first major development occurred at 11:42 UTC on January 8, 2026, when TIC (AS49666) began <a href="https://x.com/DougMadory/status/2009283110282592704" rel="noopener" target="_blank">withdrawing its IPv6 BGP routes</a> from its sessions with other networks. Within hours, nearly all of Iran’s IPv6 routing had disappeared from the global routing table.</p>
<div cursor="zoom-in"><picture><source srcset="https://images.ctfassets.net/6yom6slo28h2/1ppK9ZINkpf3PPCH7Fz7jH/cceeb4293bba7b82344abfb4a8b8797b/iran-ipv6-example-withdrawal.png?q=80&amp;fm=webp" type="image/webp"><img loading="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/6yom6slo28h2/1ppK9ZINkpf3PPCH7Fz7jH/cceeb4293bba7b82344abfb4a8b8797b/iran-ipv6-example-withdrawal.png?q=80" alt="BGP Route Viewer - Iranian IPv6 route goes from globally routed to withdrawn"></picture></div>
<p>From our perspective, this is what <a href="https://x.com/DougMadory/status/2009262285873729757" rel="noopener" target="_blank">IPv6 traffic to Iran</a> looked like on January 8.</p>
<div cursor="zoom-in"><picture><source srcset="https://images.ctfassets.net/6yom6slo28h2/1yY8T2biI3zzSEdnyX0pt3/55677251e2ea920c3ba0bb0b0b94d7c0/iran-shutdown-ipv6-20260108.png?q=80&amp;fm=webp" type="image/webp"><img loading="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/6yom6slo28h2/1yY8T2biI3zzSEdnyX0pt3/55677251e2ea920c3ba0bb0b0b94d7c0/iran-shutdown-ipv6-20260108.png?q=80" alt="Graph showing internet traffic to Iran, IPv6 only"></picture></div>
<p>However, based on our aggregate NetFlow, IPv6 traffic normally amounts to less than 1% of the overall traffic (in bits/sec) into Iran, so the average Iranian was unlikely to be affected by this issue. Regardless, the withdrawal of IPv6 routes appeared to be an early indication of what was to come later in the day.</p>
<p>Following a brief disruption, we observed internet traffic levels begin to plummet at 16:30 UTC (7pm local). The drop continued until internet traffic into Iran had all but ceased by 1845 UTC, as illustrated below. It took over two hours to stop all internet traffic into and out of the country.</p>
<div cursor="zoom-in"><picture><source srcset="https://images.ctfassets.net/6yom6slo28h2/6g5UMjH6I4DwHIBzC4Iyoe/9d9f9b37269288bb929f069b95cd93f3/iran-shutdown-ipv4-20261008.png?q=80&amp;fm=webp" type="image/webp"><img loading="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/6yom6slo28h2/6g5UMjH6I4DwHIBzC4Iyoe/9d9f9b37269288bb929f069b95cd93f3/iran-shutdown-ipv4-20261008.png?q=80" alt="Graph showing internet traffic to Iran, IPv4 only"></picture></div>
<p>At 19:00 UTC, we <a href="https://x.com/DougMadory/status/2010069808369545267" rel="noopener" target="_blank">observed TIC disconnecting</a> from a subset of its transit providers, including Russian state telecom Rostelecom (AS12389) and regional operator Gulf Bridge International (AS200612), and all of its settlement-free peers.</p>

<p>Despite the loss of numerous BGP adjacencies for AS49666 (TIC), the vast majority of Iranian IPv4 routes continued to be routed globally. The drop in Iranian IPv4 traffic, therefore, could not be explained by reachability issues; another mechanism was at work at the network edge blocking traffic.</p>
<p>Georgia Tech’s IODA tool <a href="https://ioda.inetintel.cc.gatech.edu/country/IR?from=1767654317&amp;until=1768950317&amp;view=view1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">captures this divergence</a> well. In the below screenshot, active probing (blue) drops to zero as traffic is blocked, while routed IPv4 space in BGP (green) is almost completely unscathed (98.14%).</p>
<div cursor="zoom-in"><picture><source srcset="https://images.ctfassets.net/6yom6slo28h2/5ptzzFv2j3rGR4UXwEd8hT/e88623df12b37a14356e2ca5b32392e6/iran-ioda-20260120.png?q=80&amp;fm=webp" type="image/webp"><img loading="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/6yom6slo28h2/5ptzzFv2j3rGR4UXwEd8hT/e88623df12b37a14356e2ca5b32392e6/iran-ioda-20260120.png?q=80" alt="Iran traffic as seen in IODA"></picture></div>
<p>Although IPv4 routes remained online, internet traffic stopped for roughly 90 million Iranians. This distinction is central to Iran’s next step: internet “whitelisting,” in which an Iranian version of the Chinese Great Firewall allows only approved users or services while blocking all others. Had authorities withdrawn IPv4 routes, as they did with IPv6, Iran would have become completely unreachable, as <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/02/16/world/middleeast/0212-egypt-internet.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Egypt was in January 2011</a>. By keeping IPv4 routes in circulation, Iranian authorities can selectively grant full internet access to specific users while denying it to the broader population.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the internet shutdown in Iran is not complete. There has been a tiny amount of traffic still trickling in and out as a small set of Iranians continue to enjoy internet access.</p>
<p>There have also been a few temporary partial restorations of service, such as a <a href="https://x.com/DougMadory/status/2009627610360496538" rel="noopener" target="_blank">multi-hour restoration of service to Iranian universities</a> via AS6736 on January 9th, and a more recent <a href="https://x.com/DougMadory/status/2012917572308513206" rel="noopener" target="_blank">small surge in traffic</a>.</p>
<div cursor="zoom-in"><picture><source srcset="https://images.ctfassets.net/6yom6slo28h2/6JF9d3DLLEsC5F8Bnlf3H/948174aaf83c43f64ef16ca0eae43b95/iran-universities.png?q=80&amp;fm=webp" type="image/webp"><img loading="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/6yom6slo28h2/6JF9d3DLLEsC5F8Bnlf3H/948174aaf83c43f64ef16ca0eae43b95/iran-universities.png?q=80" alt="Temporary partial restoration for Iranian universities"></picture></div>
<p>From our data, we have also observed the emergence of a diurnal pattern of traffic to AS49666 emerge on January 13. AS49666 is not typically a major terminus for internet traffic to Iran, so this traffic is likely proxied traffic from whitelisted individuals or services.</p>
<div cursor="zoom-in"><picture><source srcset="https://images.ctfassets.net/6yom6slo28h2/4G4FN3FD2grp1cABLvTMxw/0172a54fe06ff6daaecdc42977198f25/iran-shutdown-new-traffic-49666.png?q=80&amp;fm=webp" type="image/webp"><img loading="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/6yom6slo28h2/4G4FN3FD2grp1cABLvTMxw/0172a54fe06ff6daaecdc42977198f25/iran-shutdown-new-traffic-49666.png?q=80" alt="Internet raffic to TIC"></picture></div>
<p>As of late, we’ve seen a few measures like the <a href="https://x.com/DougMadory/status/2013307836109824425" rel="noopener" target="_blank">restoration of transit from Rostelecom</a> and the <a href="https://ioda.inetintel.cc.gatech.edu/asn/6736?from=1767651343&amp;until=1768860943&amp;view=view1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">return of routes originated by IPM</a>, as the country appears to be moving towards a partial restoration. At the time of this writing, the plan appears to be to operate the Iranian internet as a whitelisted network indefinitely.</p>

<p>Back in 2012, Iran was in the beginning stages of building its National Information Network (NIN), ostensibly built to allow the country to continue to function in the event that it was cut off from the outside world. At the time, I teamed up with Iran researcher Collin Anderson to investigate. With access to in-country servers, we mapped Iran’s national internet from the inside (research published <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.6398" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<p>We found that the NIN had been implemented by routing RFC1918 address space (specifically 10.x.x.x) between Iranian ASes within the country. By doing so, they could be assured that devices connected to the NIN would not be able to receive connections from the outside world, as those IP addresses are not routable on the public internet.</p>
<p>In 2019, I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191128123943/https://blogs.oracle.com/internetintelligence/historic-internet-blackout-in-iran" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported on Iran’s internet shutdown</a> following the government’s decision to raise gas prices. At the time, it was the most severe shutdown in the country’s history—until this month. It involved withdrawing BGP routes of some networks while blocking traffic of others, and lasted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Internet_blackout_in_Iran" rel="noopener" target="_blank">for almost two weeks</a>.</p>

<p>Government-directed shutdowns in <a href="https://twitter.com/DougMadory/status/1576169117039501313" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cuba</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DougMadory/status/1577341946783318035" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Iran</a> in 2022 led me to join up with <a href="https://twitter.com/lawyerpants" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Peter Micek</a> of the digital rights NGO <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Access Now</a> to write a <a href="https://www.kentik.com/blog/suppressing-dissent-the-rise-of-the-internet-curfew/">blog post that traced the history and logic behind “internet curfews,”</a> a tactic of communication suppression in which internet service is temporarily blocked on a recurring basis.</p>
<div cursor="zoom-in"><picture><source srcset="https://images.ctfassets.net/6yom6slo28h2/1YjSvk3w1qkR0D13hlFrm5/13e937d0fbf29c7a20b3c907f34b8e99/iran-sept21.png?q=80&amp;fm=webp" type="image/webp"><img loading="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/6yom6slo28h2/1YjSvk3w1qkR0D13hlFrm5/13e937d0fbf29c7a20b3c907f34b8e99/iran-sept21.png?q=80" alt="Iranian internet curfew"></picture></div>
<p>Nightly traffic drops for Iranian mobile providers during Iran’s internet curfew in 2022.</p>
<p>The article described internet curfews as another means of reducing the costs of shutdowns, not unlike the development of the NIN, according to Iranian digital rights expert <a href="https://www.kentik.com/telemetrynow/s02-e65/">Amir Rashidi</a>. In that post, we wrote:</p>
<blockquote>The objective of internet curfews, like Iran’s NIN, is to reduce the cost of shutdowns on the authorities that order them. By reducing the costs of these shutdowns, they become a more palatable option for an embattled leader and, therefore, are likely to continue in the future.</blockquote>
<p>During the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Israel_war" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Twelve-Day War</a> between Israel and Iran this June, Iran partially or fully shut down its internet, <a href="https://t.me/khabaronline_ir/591181" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ostensibly to defend against cyberattacks</a> and drone strikes. We, along with other internet observers, <a href="https://x.com/DougMadory/status/1935700667794100272" rel="noopener" target="_blank">documented the shutdown’s phases</a> and contributed to a <a href="https://filter.watch/english/2025/10/02/irans-stealth-blackout-a-multi-stakeholder-analysis-of-the-june-2025-internet-shutdown/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">detailed report</a> by Rashidi’s team, which dubbed the shutdown as a “stealth blackout” due to the fact that traffic was disrupted without withdrawing any BGP routes.</p>
<div cursor="zoom-in"><picture><source srcset="https://images.ctfassets.net/6yom6slo28h2/2QNQOMAfZ5dLNIgW3ilFGq/05af50201d10d948c7268a25af9b3ac6/iran-shutdown-timeline.png?q=80&amp;fm=webp" type="image/webp"><img loading="lazy" width="100%" height="auto" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/6yom6slo28h2/2QNQOMAfZ5dLNIgW3ilFGq/05af50201d10d948c7268a25af9b3ac6/iran-shutdown-timeline.png?q=80" alt=""></picture></div>
<p>Timeline for the stages of the Iranian internet shutdown during the Twelve-Day War.</p>
<p>The outage demonstrated Iran’s newfound ability to block traffic nationwide without manipulating BGP routes, signaling a higher level of sophistication in its internet filtering. This summer’s Stealth Blackout ultimately foreshadowed the ongoing shutdown Iran is now enduring.</p>

<p>In the aftermath of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman,_Life,_Freedom_movement" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2022 protests</a>, Starlink began allowing connections from Iran. Satellite internet operators like Starlink must typically clear, at a minimum, two legal hurdles to operate in a country: a telecom license and radio spectrum authorization from the local government. Starlink has been operational in Iran for over three years at this point without either, and the Iranian government has taken note.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-R/conferences/RRB/Pages/default.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ITU Radio Regulations Board (RRB)</a> is a quasi-judicial United Nations body that interprets and applies the <a href="https://www.itu.int/pub/R-REG-RR" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Radio Regulations</a>, to include satellite emissions. It exists to resolve disputes between countries and oversees compliance with the international radio frequency register, but, in the end, has no direct enforcement power.</p>
<p>Since 2023, the Iranian has been <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-27/why-policing-elon-musk-s-starlink-satellites-is-a-global-challenge" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pleading their case to the ITU that the Starlink</a> service in Iran needed to be disabled. The <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-R/conferences/RRB/Pages/Starlink.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">100th meeting of the ITU RRB</a> took place in November, and on the topic of Starlink, the board decided to:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Request the Administration of the Islamic Republic of Iran to pursue its efforts, to the extent possible, to identify and deactivate unauthorized STARLINK terminals in its territory,</li>
<li>Strongly urge the Administration of Norway to take all appropriate actions at its disposal to have the operator of the Starlink system immediately disable unauthorized transmissions of its terminals within the territory of the Islamic Republic of Iran.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of the decisions of this body, Starlink continues to operate in the country. (Note: The US and Norway share responsibility for Starlink’s ITU registration.)</p>
<p>Despite a recent Iranian <a href="https://www.iranintl.com/en/202510093488" rel="noopener" target="_blank">law that would equate the use of Starlink with espionage</a>, punishable by death, Iranian digital rights activists have been working for years to smuggle in terminals and build communication infrastructure to extend the internet services within the country. The recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/15/technology/iran-online-starlink.html?unlocked_article_code=1.E1A.IsKl.UErs9_Ikg9uK&amp;smid=nytcore-ios-share" rel="noopener" target="_blank">front-page New York Times article</a> I collaborated on described these efforts, which now must contend with a novel form of <a href="https://www.heise.de/en/background/Starlink-in-Iran-How-the-regime-jams-the-service-and-what-helps-against-it-11147133.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">jamming Starlink service</a> in some urban areas of Iran.</p>

<p>In the decade and a half since the internet shutdowns of the Arab Spring, we’ve observed the <a href="https://www.kentik.com/blog/from-egypt-to-uganda-a-decade-of-internet-shutdowns/">practice of suppressing communications evolve</a> as authoritarian governments learn tactics from one another. In the ongoing shutdown in Iran, multiple such tactics are on display.</p>
<p>To mitigate the costs of its shutdown, the Iranian government has created an internal national internet and appears to be in the process of building a “whitelisting” system to allow certain individuals and services internet access while blocking the rest. If these measures successfully enable an unpopular Iranian government to remain in power, we can expect to see them replicated elsewhere.</p>
<p>On the other side, the digital rights activists have also been building tools, funded in large part by the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/08/25/state-department-iran-censorship-internet/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">now-embattled Open Technology Fund</a>, to allow communications to continue during a shutdown like this. However, no amount of circumvention tooling can restore service to 90 million people.</p>
<p>The fight for open and free communications does not have an end. As long as authoritarian governments exist, this game of cat-and-mouse will continue. Ours is only to decide which side we’re on and to throw our support (financially and otherwise) to those working on solutions to these problems.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2 id="ai-agents-need-version-control-beyond-text"><a href="#ai-agents-need-version-control-beyond-text">AI agents need version control beyond text</a></h2>
<p>Changes AI agents make need to be reviewable by humans.</p>
<p>For code, Git solves this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reviewable diffs</strong>: What exactly did the agent change?</li>
<li><strong>Human-in-the-loop</strong>: Review, then merge or reject.</li>
<li><strong>Rollback changes</strong>: Undo mistakes instantly.</li>
</ul>
<p>But agents modify binary files too. And Git can't diff them.</p>
<p><img src="https://lix.dev/blog/001-introducing-lix/git-limits.png" alt="Git supports text files but not binary formats like PDF, DOCX, XLSX"></p>
<h2 id="introducing-lix"><a href="#introducing-lix">Introducing Lix</a></h2>
<p>Lix is a <strong>universal version control system</strong> that can diff any file format (<code>.xlsx</code>, <code>.pdf</code>, <code>.docx</code>, etc).</p>
<p>Unlike Git's line-based diffs, Lix understands file structure. Lix sees <code>price: 10 → 12</code> or <code>cell B4: pending → shipped</code>, not "line 4 changed" or "binary files differ".</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reviewable diffs</strong>: See exactly what an agent changed in any file format.</li>
<li><strong>Human-in-the-loop</strong>: Agents propose, humans approve.</li>
<li><strong>Safe rollback</strong>: Undo mistakes instantly.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-does-lix-work"><a href="#how-does-lix-work">How does Lix work?</a></h2>
<p>Lix adds a version control system on top of SQL databases that let's you query virtual tables like <code>file</code>, <code>file_history</code>, etc. via plain SQL. These table's are version controlled.</p>
<p><strong>Why this matters:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lix doesn't reinvent databases</strong> — durability, ACID, and corruption recovery are handled by battle-tested SQL databases.</li>
<li><strong>Full SQL support</strong> — query your version control system with the same SQL.</li>
<li><strong>Can runs in your existing database</strong> — no separate storage layer to manage.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lix was developed alongside <a href="https://inlang.com/">inlang</a>, open-source localization infrastructure.</p>
<p>We had to develop a new version control system that addressed git's limitations inlang ran into, see (see <a href="https://samuelstroschein.com/blog/git-limitations">"Git is unsuited for applications"</a>). The result is Lix, now at over <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lix-js/sdk">90k weekly downloads on NPM</a>.</p>

Inside of a sandbox, Dangerzone converts the document to a PDF (if it isn't already one), and then converts the PDF into raw pixel data: a huge list of RGB color values for each page. Then, outside of the sandbox, Dangerzone takes this pixel data and converts it back into a PDF.</p>

<p dir="auto">Dangerzone gets updates to improve its features <em>and</em> to fix problems. So, updating may be the simplest path to resolving the issue which brought you here. Here is how to update:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Check which version of Dangerzone you are currently using: run Dangerzone, then look for a series of numbers to the right of the logo within the app. The format of the numbers will look similar to <code>0.4.1</code></li>
<li>Now find the latest available version of Dangerzone: go to the <a href="https://dangerzone.rocks/#downloads" rel="nofollow">download page</a>. Look for the version number displayed. The number will be using the same format as in Step 1.</li>

                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>This study explores the neural and behavioral consequences of LLM-assisted essay writing. Participants were divided into three groups: LLM, Search Engine, and Brain-only (no tools). Each completed three sessions under the same condition. In a fourth session, LLM users were reassigned to Brain-only group (LLM-to-Brain), and Brain-only users were reassigned to LLM condition (Brain-to-LLM). A total of 54 participants took part in Sessions 1-3, with 18 completing session 4. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess cognitive load during essay writing, and analyzed essays using NLP, as well as scoring essays with the help from human teachers and an AI judge. Across groups, NERs, n-gram patterns, and topic ontology showed within-group homogeneity. EEG revealed significant differences in brain connectivity: Brain-only participants exhibited the strongest, most distributed networks; Search Engine users showed moderate engagement; and LLM users displayed the weakest connectivity. Cognitive activity scaled down in relation to external tool use. In session 4, LLM-to-Brain participants showed reduced alpha and beta connectivity, indicating under-engagement. Brain-to-LLM users exhibited higher memory recall and activation of occipito-parietal and prefrontal areas, similar to Search Engine users. Self-reported ownership of essays was the lowest in the LLM group and the highest in the Brain-only group. LLM users also struggled to accurately quote their own work. While LLMs offer immediate convenience, our findings highlight potential cognitive costs. Over four months, LLM users consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels. These results raise concerns about the long-term educational implications of LLM reliance and underscore the need for deeper inquiry into AI's role in learning.</p>

  <section>
    <p>eBay explicitly prohibits AI "buy for me" agents and LLM (larger language model) bots, updates arbitration and dispute resolution requirements in latest User Agreement update, going into effect February 20, 2026.</p><p>The following summary of changes was provided in an email sent to users:</p><blockquote>
<div><p>We’ve updated eBay’s User Agreement, including the agreement to arbitrate any disputes you may have with us. Our updated User Agreement was posted on January 20, 2026. For users who agreed to a prior version of our User Agreement, this agreement is effective as of February 20, 2026.</p></div>
<p>In this update, eBay is updating its anti-scraping prohibition to clarify that it specifically also includes bots used for AI or LLMs. eBay is also updating the agreement to arbitrate in the updated User Agreement:</p>
<ul>
<li>We clarified the scope of the class action waiver.</li>
<li>We clarified the process for opting out of the agreement to arbitrate.</li>
<li>We updated the physical address to which notices for informal dispute resolution, arbitration demands, and notices for opting out of arbitration must be sent.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As always, sellers are encouraged to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ebay.com/help/policies/member-behaviour-policies/user-agreement?id=4259" rel="noreferrer">read&nbsp;the entire updated terms carefully</a>, but Value Added Resource has you covered with a side by side comparison highlighting some key changes.</p><p><em>Disclaimer: comparisons are made using both automated and manual methods and are provided for informational purposes only - no warranty of completeness or accuracy is expressed or implied and users are advised to do their own due diligence.</em></p><h3 id="ai-agents-llm-scraping">AI Agents &amp; LLM Scraping</h3><p>First, as the summary calls out, eBay is explicitly prohibiting AI "buy for me" agents and LLM scraping bots from interacting with the platform without permission from eBay.</p><p>Old Version:</p><blockquote>
<div><p>In connection with using or accessing our Services you agree to comply with this User Agreement, our policies, our terms, and all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and you will not...</p></div>
<p>...use any robot, spider, scraper, data mining tools, data gathering and extraction tools, or other automated means to access our Services for any purpose, except with the prior express permission of eBay;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>New Version:</p><blockquote>
<div><p>In connection with using or accessing our Services you agree to comply with this User Agreement, our policies, our terms, and all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and you will not...</p></div>
<p>use any robot, spider, scraper, data mining tools, data gathering and extraction tools, or other automated means <strong>(including, without limitation buy-for-me agents, LLM-driven bots, or any end-to-end flow that attempts to place orders without human review)</strong> to access our Services for any purpose, except with the prior express permission of eBay;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The move comes after eBay quietly changed their robots.txt file with new guidance placing guardrails and restrictions on how AI agents interact with the site in December.</p><figure><a href="https://www.valueaddedresource.net/ebay-ai-holidays-agent-policy-updates/"><div><p>eBay Encourages Buyers &amp; Sellers To Use AI For The Holidays While Quietly Updating AI Agent Policy</p><p>eBay encourages buyers &amp; sellers to “unwrap innovation” with AI this holiday season, quietly adds guardrails on how AI agents interact with site.</p><p><img src="https://www.valueaddedresource.net/content/images/icon/Value-Added-Resource-copy--3--2694.png" alt=""><span>Liz Morton</span></p></div><p><img src="https://www.valueaddedresource.net/content/images/thumbnail/ebayaiholidays-2.jpg" alt="" onerror="this.style.display = 'none'"></p></a></figure><p>It also comes on the heels of Amazon's controversial Buy For Me test which uses agentic AI to display items from direct merchant websites for sale through the Amazon app, even if the brand does not sell on Amazon themselves - raising concerns about transparency, consent, and control over how product details are displayed to buyers.</p><figure><a href="https://www.valueaddedresource.net/amazon-buy-for-me-small-business-backlash/"><div><p>Amazon’s “Buy For Me” Agentic AI Sparks Backlash As Small Businesses Say Listings Are Being Hijacked</p><p>Small businesses say Amazon’s “Buy For Me” agentic AI uses their product data without consent, causing pricing, fulfillment &amp; buyer trust concerns.</p><p><img src="https://www.valueaddedresource.net/content/images/icon/Value-Added-Resource-copy--3--2695.png" alt=""><span>Value Added Resource</span><span>Liz Morton</span></p></div><p><img src="https://www.valueaddedresource.net/content/images/thumbnail/amazonbuyforme-2.jpg" alt="" onerror="this.style.display = 'none'"></p></a></figure><p>While it appears that Amazon Buy For Me currently does <strong><em>not </em></strong>pull inventory from other third party marketplaces, it would not be surprising if eBay is reacting at least in part to this and other agentic commerce news making recent headlines.</p><h3 id="arbitration-dispute-resolution">Arbitration &amp; Dispute Resolution</h3><p>The rest of the changes in this User Agreement update affect arbitration and dispute resolution.</p><p>eBay's previous User Agreement update in May 2025 made significant changes to arbitration terms and limits on lawsuits, forcing users to give up their right to the sue the company in many situations.</p><figure><a href="https://www.valueaddedresource.net/ebay-user-agreement-may-2025-arbitration/"><div><p>eBay User Agreement Update May 2025: New Arbitration Terms &amp; Limits On Lawsuits</p><p>eBay has released an update to their user agreement with significant changes to arbitration terms &amp; limits on lawsuits, effective May 16th 2025.</p><p><img src="https://www.valueaddedresource.net/content/images/icon/Value-Added-Resource-copy--3--2696.png" alt=""><span>Value Added Resource</span><span>Liz Morton</span></p></div><p><img src="https://www.valueaddedresource.net/content/images/thumbnail/ebayua41725-3.jpg" alt="" onerror="this.style.display = 'none'"></p></a></figure><p>In this update, eBay has finally updated the address to send arbitration opt out requests and other legal correspondence to since <a href="https://www.valueaddedresource.net/ebay-draper-ut-campus-up-for-sale/" rel="noreferrer">selling their former office in Draper, UT in 2024</a>.</p><p>Old Version:</p><blockquote>

<p>New Version:</p><blockquote>
<p>Notice to eBay should be sent by email to <a href="mailto:DisputeNotice@eBay.com">DisputeNotice@eBay.com</a> or regular mail to our offices located at 339 W. 13490 S., Ste. 500, Draper, UT 84020</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most importantly, eBay has expanded their arbitration clause which previously prohibited class actions to now also explicitly exclude more types of group legal actions.</p><p>Old Version:</p><blockquote>
<div><p>EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE.</p></div>
<p>Subject to this Agreement to Arbitrate, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 19.B.7 ("Batch Arbitration").</p>
</blockquote>
<p>New Version:</p><blockquote>
<div><p>EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, OR REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING, NOR OTHERWISE TO SEEK RECOVERY OF LOSSES OR DAMAGES (WHETHER FOR YOURSELF OR OTHERS) INCURRED BY A THIRD PARTY, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE.</p></div>
<p>Subject to this Agreement to Arbitrate, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 19.B.7 ("Batch Arbitration").</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's what that means in plain language:</p><ul><li><strong>“Not as a plaintiff or class member”</strong>&nbsp;— prevents someone from joining an existing class action.</li><li><strong>“No private attorney general actions”</strong>&nbsp;— blocks lawsuits brought “on behalf of the public,” a type of claim sometimes used in consumer protection cases.</li><li><strong>“Nor… for losses incurred by a third party”</strong>&nbsp;— prevents a person from trying to recover damages suffered by someone else.</li></ul><p>Note: this language does <strong><em>not </em></strong>in any way change or restrict legal action that state Attorneys General, the FTC or other regulatory or legal agencies can take on behalf of sellers and/or consumers - so don't be dissuaded from letting those agencies know about your experiences with the platform, like the recent changes to Promoted Listings ad attribution policies.</p><figure><a href="https://www.valueaddedresource.net/report-ebay-ad-policies-ftc-attorney-general/"><div><p>A Seller’s Guide To Speaking Up: How To Report eBay’s New Ad Policies To The FTC &amp; State AGs</p><p>Concerned about eBay’s controversial new Promoted Listings ad rules?

<p>IF YOU ARE A NEW USER OF OUR SERVICES, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO OPT OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE ("OPT OUT") BY MAILING US A WRITTEN OPT-OUT NOTICE ("OPT-OUT NOTICE").</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that's it for changes to eBay's User Agreement going into effect February 20, 2026.</p><p><em>Let us know in the comments below what you think of these change and how they'll affect your business!</em></p>

<p>When shadow library Anna’s Archive <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/annas-archive-loses-org-domain-says-suspension-likely-unrelated-to-spotify-piracy/">lost its .org domain</a> in early January, the controversial site’s operator said the suspension didn’t appear to have anything to do with its recent <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/worlds-largest-shadow-library-brags-it-scraped-300tb-of-spotify-music-metadata/">mass scraping of Spotify</a>.</p>
<p>But it turns out, probably not surprisingly to most people, that the domain suspension resulted from a lawsuit filed by Spotify, along with major record labels Sony, Warner, and Universal Music Group (UMG). The music companies sued Anna’s Archive in late December in US District Court for the Southern District of New York, and the case was initially sealed.</p>
<p>A judge ordered the case unsealed on January 16 “because the purpose for which sealing was ordered has been fulfilled.” Numerous documents were made public on the court docket yesterday, and they explain events around the domain suspension.</p>
<p>On January 2, the music companies asked for a temporary restraining order, and the court <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.655608/gov.uscourts.nysd.655608.19.0.pdf">granted</a> it the same day. The order imposed requirements on the Public Interest Registry (PIR), a US-based nonprofit that oversees .org domains, and Cloudflare.</p>
<p>“Together, PIR and Cloudflare have the power to shut off access to the three web domains that Anna’s Archive uses to unlawfully distribute copyrighted works,” the music companies <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.655608/gov.uscourts.nysd.655608.11.0.pdf">told the court</a>. They asked the court to issue “a temporary restraining order requiring that Anna’s Archive immediately cease and desist from all reproduction or distribution of the Record Company Plaintiffs’ copyrighted works,” and to “exercise its power under the All Writs Act to direct PIR and Cloudflare to facilitate enforcement of that order.”</p>
<h2>Anna’s Archive notified of case after suspension</h2>
<p>The companies further asked that Anna’s Archive receive notice of the case by email only after the “order is issued by the Court and implemented by PIR and Cloudflare, to prevent Anna’s Archive from following through with its plan to release millions of illegally obtained, copyrighted sound recordings to the public.” That is apparently what happened, given that the operator of Anna’s Archive initially <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Annas_Archive/comments/1q3zxlb/message_from_anna_were_fine/">said</a> domain suspensions are just something that “unfortunately happens to shadow libraries on a regular basis,” and that “we don’t believe this has to do with our Spotify backup.”</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The request from Spotify and record labels said:</p>
<blockquote><p>[I]f Anna’s Archive receives notice that the Record Company Plaintiffs are seeking this temporary restraining order, it will almost certainly release the sound recordings that it has illegally copied from Spotify to the public immediately and activate contingency plans to relocate its infrastructure outside of the United States. To prevent this, Plaintiffs have filed their Complaint under seal, and the Record Company Plaintiffs now ask the Court to issue its temporary restraining order on an ex parte basis, so that Anna’s Archive cannot preemptively frustrate the very relief sought by the Record Company Plaintiffs’ motion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Anna’s Archive has already released Spotify metadata but not the songs, the companies said. Although the record companies are winning their case, that doesn’t necessarily mean they’ll be able to stop distribution of copyrighted files.</p>
<p>As the music companies noted, the “individuals who operate Anna’s Archive believe that they can ignore the law by remaining anonymous, accepting payments from users in cryptocurrency, and using foreign domain registrars and web hosting services that turn a blind eye to copyright infringement… The websites Anna’s Archive uses are either completely anonymous, or in one instance, registered to what appears to be a bogus company with a dubious address in Liberia, which is not a party to the Hague Convention governing service.”</p>

<h2>Anna’s Archive still up despite losing some domains</h2>
<p>The music companies argued that Cloudflare could prevent access to Anna’s Archive URLs registered outside the United States, but this doesn’t seem to have been completely successful. The companies said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Although the domain name registrars for the annas-archive.li and annas-archive.se domains are located outside of the United States, Anna’s Archive relies on Cloudflare, headquartered in San Francisco, California, to provide a so-called “reverse proxy service” for the sites. Cloudflare effectively acts as a “middleman” between the websites and users who wish to access them, providing the information necessary for a user’s computer to convert the domain names into the numerical Internet Protocol address of the server hosting the website. These “authoritative nameservers” are necessary for users to connect to Anna’s Archive using the annas-archive.li and annas-archive.se domains, and Cloudflare has the technical capability to disable the authoritative nameservers, which would prevent users from accessing these websites.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the annas-archive.se domain couldn’t be reached today, we were still able to access annas-archive.li.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/unsealed-spotify-lawsuit-triggered-annas-archive-domain-name-suspensions/">TorrentFreak noticed</a> a recent change to the portion of the Anna’s Archive website that <a href="https://annas-archive.li/torrents/spotify">linked to torrents</a> of Spotify data: It now says, “Unavailable until further notice.” The page previously linked to three torrent files labeled as metadata, audio analysis, and cover art, but has displayed the “unavailable” message since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260114214206/https://annas-archive.li/torrents/spotify">at least January 14</a>. The three torrents apparently add up to 6.2TB worth of data, while the entire scrape is said to be around 300TB worth of Spotify’s most-streamed songs.</p>
<p>TorrentFreak wrote, “it appears that Anna’s Archive stopped the specific distribution of Spotify content alleged in the complaint, seemingly in partial compliance with the injunction’s ban on ‘making available’ the scraped files.” But we found it was still possible today to download the Spotify torrent files from Anna’s Archive by going to the individual URLs that used to be listed on the page.</p>
<h2>Preliminary injunction</h2>
<p>When the temporary restraining order was granted on January 2, the court also issued an order to show cause. Anna’s Archive was told to file an answer by January 12, but did not do so, and no one representing Anna’s Archive appeared at a show-cause hearing on January 16.</p>
<p>After the hearing, US District Judge Jed Rakoff granted a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.655608/gov.uscourts.nysd.655608.17.0.pdf">preliminary injunction</a>, which is essentially a longer-term and more expansive version of the temporary restraining order. Rakoff said the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in proving that Anna’s Archive infringed copyrights by scraping songs from Spotify, and that Anna’s Archive “has threatened and/or is threatening to engage in additional acts of infringement by further reproducing and distributing copyrighted works… by, <em>inter alia</em>, posting ‘torrent’ files on websites owned or controlled by Anna’s Archive.”</p>
<p>While the judge ordered Anna’s Archive to stop what it’s doing, the order more significantly imposes obligations on “all domain name registries and registrars of record for Anna’s Archive Domain Names and all hosting and Internet service providers for Anna’s Archive Websites.” These companies must disable access to Anna’s Archive domain names “and prevent their transfer to anyone other than the Record Company Plaintiffs,” and “cease any hosting services for Anna’s Archive Websites or any other websites that host the infringing content or directly facilitate its distribution.”</p>

        <div>
          
          
<p>The judge named specific companies the order applies to, though it is not limited to those companies. In addition to the Public Interest Registry and Cloudflare, the judge said the order applies to the Switch Foundation, the Swedish Internet Foundation, the National Internet Exchange of India, Njalla SRL, IQWeb FZ-LLC, Immaterialism Ltd., Hosting Concepts B.V., and Tucows Domains.</p>
<p>The operator of the WorldCat library catalog separately won a default judgment against Anna’s Archive in a different court last week. A judge ruled that Anna’s Archive must delete all copies of its WorldCat data and stop scraping, using, storing, or distributing the data. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/judge-orders-annas-archive-to-delete-scraped-data-no-one-thinks-it-will-comply/">No one thinks Anna’s Archive will comply</a>, but the WorldCat operator said a court order would help it ask hosting services to remove data from Anna’s Archive websites.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260120000333.htm">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260120000333.htm</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46709179">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p id="first">A study led by Stanford Medicine researchers has found that an injection blocking a protein linked to aging can reverse the natural loss of knee cartilage in older mice. The same treatment also stopped arthritis from developing after knee injuries that resemble ACL tears, which are common among athletes and recreational exercisers. Researchers note that an oral version of the treatment is already being tested in clinical trials aimed at treating age-related muscle weakness.</p><div id="text">
<p>Human cartilage samples taken from knee replacement surgeries also responded positively. These samples included both the supportive extracellular matrix of the joint and cartilage-producing chondrocyte cells. When treated, the tissue began forming new, functional cartilage.</p>
<p>Together, the findings suggest that cartilage lost due to aging or arthritis may one day be restored using either a pill or a targeted injection. If successful in people, such treatments could reduce or even eliminate the need for knee and hip replacement surgery.</p>
<p><strong>A Direct Attack on Osteoarthritis</strong></p>
<p>Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that affects about one in five adults in the United States and generates an estimated $65 billion each year in direct health care costs. Current treatments focus on managing pain or replacing damaged joints surgically. There are no approved drugs that can slow or reverse the underlying cartilage damage.</p>
<p>The new approach targets the root cause of the disease rather than its symptoms, offering a potential shift in how osteoarthritis is treated.</p>
<p><strong>The Role of a Master Aging Enzyme</strong></p>
<p>The protein at the center of the study is called 15-PGDH. Researchers refer to it as a gerozyme because its levels increase as the body ages. Gerozymes were identified by the same research team in 2023 and are known to drive the gradual loss of tissue function.</p>


<p>In mice, higher levels of 15-PGDH are linked to declining muscle strength with age. Blocking the enzyme using a small molecule boosted muscle mass and endurance in older animals. In contrast, forcing young mice to produce more 15-PGDH caused their muscles to shrink and weaken. The protein has also been connected to regeneration in bone, nerve, and blood cells.</p>
<p>In most of these tissues, repair happens through the activation and specialization of stem cells. Cartilage appears to be different. In this case, chondrocytes change how their genes behave, shifting into a more youthful state without relying on stem cells.</p>
<p><strong>A New Path to Tissue Regeneration</strong></p>
<p>"This is a new way of regenerating adult tissue, and it has significant clinical promise for treating arthritis due to aging or injury," said Helen Blau, PhD, professor of microbiology and immunology. "We were looking for stem cells, but they are clearly not involved. It's very exciting."</p>
<p>Blau, who leads the Baxter Laboratory for Stem Cell Biology and holds the Donald E. and Delia B. Baxter Foundation Professorship, and Nidhi Bhutani, PhD, associate professor of orthopaedic surgery, are the study's senior authors. The research was published in <em>Science</em>. Mamta Singla, PhD, instructor of orthopaedic surgery, and former postdoctoral scholar Yu Xin (Will) Wang, PhD, served as lead authors. Wang is now an assistant professor at the Sanford Burnham Institute in San Diego.</p>
<p><strong>Dramatic Regeneration of Joint Cartilage</strong></p>
<p>"Millions of people suffer from joint pain and swelling as they age," Bhutani said. "It is a huge unmet medical need. Until now, there has been no drug that directly treats the cause of cartilage loss. But this gerozyme inhibitor causes a dramatic regeneration of cartilage beyond that reported in response to any other drug or intervention."</p>


<p>The human body contains three main types of cartilage. Elastic cartilage is soft and flexible and forms structures such as the outer ear. Fibrocartilage is dense and tough, helping absorb shock in places like the spaces between spinal vertebrae. Hyaline cartilage is smooth and glossy, allowing joints such as the hips, knees, shoulders, and ankles to move with low friction. This type, also called articular cartilage, is the form most commonly damaged in osteoarthritis.</p>
<p><strong>Why Cartilage Rarely Grows Back</strong></p>
<p>Osteoarthritis develops when joints are stressed by aging, injury, or obesity. Chondrocytes begin releasing inflammatory molecules and breaking down collagen, the main structural protein in cartilage. As collagen is lost, cartilage becomes thinner and softer. Inflammation then leads to swelling and pain, which are hallmarks of the disease.</p>
<p>Under normal conditions, articular cartilage has very limited ability to regenerate. While some stem or progenitor cells capable of forming cartilage have been identified in bone, similar cells have not been successfully found within articular cartilage itself.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting Aging, Prostaglandins, and Repair</strong></p>
<p>Earlier research from Blau's lab showed that prostaglandin E2 is essential for muscle stem cell function. The enzyme 15-PGDH breaks down prostaglandin E2. By blocking 15-PGDH or increasing prostaglandin E2 levels, researchers previously supported the repair of damaged muscle, nerve, bone, colon, liver, and blood cells in young mice.</p>
<p>This led the team to question whether the same pathway might be involved in cartilage aging and joint damage. When they compared knee cartilage from young and old mice, they found that 15-PGDH levels roughly doubled with age.</p>
<p><strong>Regrowing Cartilage in Aging Knees</strong></p>
<p>Researchers then injected older mice with a small molecule that inhibits 15-PGDH. They first administered the drug into the abdomen to affect the entire body, and later injected it directly into the knee joint. In both cases, cartilage that had become thin and dysfunctional with age thickened across the joint surface.</p>
<p>Additional tests confirmed that the regenerated tissue was hyaline cartilage rather than the less functional fibrocartilage.</p>
<p>"Cartilage regeneration to such an extent in aged mice took us by surprise," Bhutani said. "The effect was remarkable."</p>
<p><strong>Protecting Joints After ACL-Like Injuries</strong></p>
<p>The team observed similar benefits in mice with knee injuries resembling ACL tears, which often occur during sports involving sudden stopping, pivoting, or jumping. Although such injuries can be surgically repaired, about half of affected people develop osteoarthritis in the injured joint within 15 years.</p>
<p>Mice that received twice-weekly injections of the gerozyme inhibitor for four weeks after injury were far less likely to develop osteoarthritis. In contrast, animals given a control treatment had double the levels of 15-PGDH compared with uninjured mice and developed osteoarthritis within four weeks.</p>
<p>Treated mice also moved more normally and placed more weight on the injured leg than untreated animals.</p>
<p>"Interestingly, prostaglandin E2 has been implicated in inflammation and pain," Blau said. "But this research shows that, at normal biological levels, small increases in prostaglandin E2 can promote regeneration."</p>
<p><strong>Reprogramming Cartilage Cells Without Stem Cells</strong></p>
<p>Closer analysis showed that chondrocytes in older mice expressed more genes linked to inflammation and the conversion of cartilage into bone, along with fewer genes involved in cartilage formation. Treatment shifted these patterns.</p>
<p>One group of chondrocytes that produced 15-PGDH and cartilage-degrading genes dropped from 8% to 3%. Another group associated with fibrocartilage formation declined from 16% to 8%. A third population, which did not produce 15-PGDH and instead expressed genes tied to hyaline cartilage formation and maintenance of the extracellular matrix, rose from 22% to 42%.</p>
<p>These changes indicate a broad return to a more youthful cartilage profile without involving stem or progenitor cells.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence From Human Cartilage Samples</strong></p>
<p>The researchers also tested cartilage taken from patients undergoing total knee replacement for osteoarthritis. After one week of treatment with the 15-PGDH inhibitor, the tissue showed fewer 15-PGDH-producing chondrocytes, reduced expression of cartilage degradation and fibrocartilage genes, and early signs of articular cartilage regeneration.</p>
<p>"The mechanism is quite striking and really shifted our perspective about how tissue regeneration can occur," Bhutani said. "It's clear that a large pool of already existing cells in cartilage are changing their gene expression patterns. And by targeting these cells for regeneration, we may have an opportunity to have a bigger overall impact clinically."</p>
<p><strong>Looking Toward Human Trials</strong></p>
<p>Blau added, "Phase 1 clinical trials of a 15-PGDH inhibitor for muscle weakness have shown that it is safe and active in healthy volunteers. Our hope is that a similar trial will be launched soon to test its effect in cartilage regeneration. We are very excited about this potential breakthrough. Imagine regrowing existing cartilage and avoiding joint replacement."</p>
<p>Researchers from the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute also contributed to the study.</p>
<p>The work was supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health (grants R01AR070864, R01AR077530, R01AG069858 and R00NS120278), the Baxter Foundation for Stem Cell Biology, the Li Ka Shing Foundation, the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute, the Milky Way Research Foundation, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, a Stanford Translational Research and Applied Medicine Pilot grant, a GlaxoSmithKline Sir James Black Postdoctoral Fellowship, and a Stanford Dean's Postdoctoral Fellowship.</p>
<p>Blau, Bhutani, and other co-authors are inventors on patent applications held by Stanford University related to 15-PGDH inhibition in cartilage and tissue rejuvenation, which are licensed to Epirium Bio. Blau is a co-founder of Myoforte/Epirium and holds equity and stock options in the company.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/waiting-dawn-search">https://blog.kagi.com/waiting-dawn-search</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46708678">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
            <p>This blog post is a follow-up to <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/dawn-new-era-search">Dawn of a new era in Search</a>, published last year. A lot has changed: the legal case has advanced, AI has become the central battleground, and the need for open index access has only grown sharper.</p>

<p>As of late 2025, one company decides what nearly 9 out of 10 people see when they search the web: Google. On August 5, 2024, a U.S. court officially ruled that Google is a monopolist in general search services. This ruling is not about ads or browser defaults alone. It is about who controls the index that powers both search and AI - and whether anyone else is allowed to build on it.</p>

<p>The stakes have grown sharper over the past year. LLMs hallucinate without grounding in real-world information; every agent that answers questions about the real world, depends on search. LLMs themselves are a blend of proprietary and open source. Cloud compute is competitive. But search is different - only one company controls a comprehensive, fresh, high-quality web index. If one company controls the index, it controls the floor on how good AI can be - and who gets to build it. The innovation crunch in search is now an innovation crunch in AI.</p>

<p>We are writing this from a position we believe in: people should have the choice to access information without behaviour-changing, ad-driven, intermediary standing between them and knowledge.</p>

<p>Why does this matter? The information we consume shapes our understanding of the world as profoundly as the food we eat shapes our bodies. Search (directly, and indirectly through AI) is the primary mechanism through which we inform political judgments, financial decisions, medical choices, and countless other consequential aspects of our lives. When a single company controls the gateway to information - and operates that gateway in ways misaligned with user interests - it influences not only what we know, but how we reason.</p>

<h2>The problem: A search monopoly</h2>

<p>The data is stark.</p>

<p><strong>Worldwide search market share (October 2025, StatCounter):</strong></p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Search Engine</th>
<th>Market Share</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Google</td>
<td>90.06%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Bing</td>
<td>4.31%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Yandex</td>
<td>1.84%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Yahoo</td>
<td>1.45%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>DuckDuckGo</td>
<td>0.89%</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Baidu</td>
<td>0.73%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The United States is similar: Google at 85%, Bing at 9%, everyone else in the noise.</p>

<p>This is not a competitive market. It is a monopoly with a distant second place.</p>

<p>The search index is irreplaceable infrastructure. Building a comparable one from scratch is like building a parallel national railroad. Microsoft <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/24/google-says-microsoft-offered-to-sell-bing-to-apple-in-2018.html#:~:text=The%20Justice%20Department%20said%20in%20its%20own%20newly%20unsealed%20filing%20that%20Microsoft%20has%20spent%20almost%20$100%20billion%20on%20Bing%20over%2020%20years">spent</a> roughly $100 billion over 20 years on Bing and still holds single-digit share. If Microsoft cannot close the gap, no startup can do it alone.</p>

<p>This is exactly what the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act/">Sherman Act</a> was designed to address: when one company’s control of critical infrastructure prevents effective competition, regulators must force open access on fair terms.</p>

<p>When a single, ad-driven gatekeeper controls the primary way humans reach information, it is not just competition that suffers - it is our collective ability to learn, to make informed medical and economic choices, and to participate meaningfully in democratic life.</p>

<p>As Ian Bremmer <a href="https://x.com/ianbremmer/status/966677755424313344">put it</a>: <em>“The idea that we get our information as citizens through algorithms determined by the world’s largest advertising company is my definition of dystopia.”</em></p>

<p>Google’s own founders knew this. In their <a href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/papers/google.pdf">1998 white paper</a>, Sergey Brin and Larry Page sharply criticized the ad-supported search model for creating mixed motives and biasing results toward advertisers’ interests. They wrote that <em>“advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers”</em> and that <em>“advertising income often provides an incentive to provide poor quality search results.”</em> Those concerns have only grown more pressing as search has become the primary interface between humanity and the web.</p>

<h2>We tried to do it the right way</h2>

<p>Kagi has always tried to integrate the best sources of knowledge into one coherent, ad-free experience. We see ourselves as connective tissue: letting people reach high-quality information directly, without passing through an ad system whose incentives are misaligned with their needs.</p>

<p>We approached every major index vendor seeking direct licensing on FRAND terms (Fair, Reasonable, And Non-Discriminatory): fair pricing, no mandatory ad syndication, ability to reorder and blend results. We succeeded with many, including:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Vendor</th>
<th>Status</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Mojeek</td>
<td>Direct license</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Brave</td>
<td>Direct license</td>

<tr>
<td>Yandex</td>
<td>Direct license</td>

<tr>

<td>Direct license</td>

<tr>

<tr>

<td>Direct license</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Wolfram Alpha</td>
<td>Direct license</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Our own Small Web Index</td>
<td>Proprietary</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>With Google and Bing, we failed - not for lack of trying.</p>

<p>Bing: Their terms didn’t work for us from the start. Microsoft’s terms prohibited reordering results or merging them with other sources - restrictions incompatible with Kagi’s approach. In February 2023, they announced price increases of up to 10x on some API tiers. Then in May 2025, they retired the Bing Search APIs <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/announcements/bing-search-api-retirement/">entirely</a>, effective August 2025, directing customers toward AI-focused alternatives like Azure AI Agents.</p>

<p>Google: Google does not offer a public search API. The only available path is an ad-syndication bundle with no changes to result presentation - the model <a href="https://startpage.com/">Startpage</a> uses. Ad syndication is a non-starter for Kagi’s ad-free subscription model.[^1]</p>

<h2>The current interim approach</h2>

<p>Because direct licensing isn’t available to us on compatible terms, we - like many others - use third-party API providers for SERP-style results (SERP meaning search engine results page). These providers serve major enterprises (according to their websites) including Nvidia, Adobe, Samsung, Stanford, DeepMind, Uber, and the United Nations.</p>

<p>This is not our preferred solution. We plan to exit it as soon as direct, contractual access becomes available. There is no legitimate, paid path to comprehensive Google or Bing results for a company like Kagi. Our position is clear: open the search index, make it available on FRAND terms, and enable rapid innovation in the marketplace.</p>

<h2>The DOJ ruling</h2>

<p>The Google antitrust case began in 2020. On August 5, 2024, the court ruled Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act by unlawfully maintaining its monopoly through exclusive distribution agreements. (<a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.1033.0_5.pdf">Full ruling</a>)</p>

<p>On September 2, 2025, the DOJ announced remedies (<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-wins-significant-remedies-against-google">press release</a>):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Limits on exclusivity:</strong> Google is prohibited from exclusive contracts related to Search, Chrome, Assistant, and Gemini.</li>
<li><strong>Data sharing and syndication:</strong> Google must provide search index and interaction data to competitors and offer syndication services to help rivals build competitive search.</li>
<li><strong>Addressing monopolization tactics:</strong> The remedies aim to dismantle a decade of exclusionary agreements.</li>
</ul>

<p>In December 2025, Judge Mehta issued a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.1461.0_2.pdf">memorandum</a> outlining the specific remedies the court intends to impose. The details are significant:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Mandatory syndication:</strong> Google must offer query-based search syndication to “Qualified Competitors” on terms no less favorable than those provided to current partners.</li>
<li><strong>No ad bundling:</strong> Google cannot condition access to search results on the use of Google Ads; competitors are free to monetize via their own ads or third parties.</li>
<li><strong>Index data access:</strong> Google must provide Web Search Index data (URLs, crawl metadata, spam scores) at marginal cost.</li>
<li><strong>Duration:</strong> The judgment remains in effect for 6 years, with syndication licenses guaranteed for terms of 5 years.</li>
</ul>

<p>If implemented as outlined, this is exactly what we have been asking for. The legal trajectory is promising. Google will contest details, and final enforceable terms are still being worked out. The fight now is ensuring these remedies become real, practical access - not paper compliance.</p>

<h3>Why enforcement matters now</h3>

<p>Even as these remedies take shape, Google is moving to close the back door. In December 2025, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/12/google-lobs-lawsuit-at-search-result-scraping-firm-serpapi/">Google sued SerpApi</a> for scraping its results at scale.</p>

<p>We take a measured, principled view:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Context matters:</strong> Google built its index by crawling the open web before robots.txt was a widespread norm, often over publishers’ objections. Today, publishers “consent” to Google’s crawling because the alternative - being invisible on a platform with 90% market share - is economically unacceptable. Google now enforces ToS and robots.txt against others from a position of monopoly power it accumulated without those constraints. The rules Google enforces today are not the rules it played by when building its dominance.</li>
<li><strong>The structural problem remains:</strong> This lawsuit is only necessary because Google refuses to offer legitimate, paid index access.</li>
<li><strong>Our position is unchanged:</strong> We have always wanted direct licensing. We would happily pay market rates for clean, contractual access. The fact that we - and companies like Stanford, Nvidia, Adobe, and the United Nations - have had to rely on third-party vendors is a symptom of the closed ecosystem, not a preference.</li>
</ul>

<p>The connection to DOJ remedies is direct: if Google is going to close the back door, regulators must ensure the front door is open. That is exactly what the DOJ’s index syndication requirements are meant to achieve - and why we support their full implementation.</p>

<h2>What could be: A layered search ecosystem</h2>

<p>The DOJ ruling does not itself create a healthy market, but it makes one possible.</p>

<p>And while this post focuses on remedies and their impact on Kagi, it is worth zooming out: even if those remedies work perfectly, long-term societal prosperity and resilience require a non-commercial baseline for access to information - something that is not dependent on ad incentives or a single vendor’s business priorities. Think of it as a north-star model for a modern society where information access is a fundamental right.</p>

<p>Here is what that could look like:</p>

<h3>Layer 1: Search as a public good</h3>

<p>This is a long-term possibility, not a near-term expectation. A government-backed, ad-free, intermediary-free, taxpayer-funded search service providing baseline, non-discriminatory access to information. Imagine search.org.</p>

<p>This is not something the DOJ remedies create directly, nor something Kagi expects to exist soon. It is included here to make explicit what an open-index world could ultimately make possible.</p>

<p>This layer would replace the role public libraries played for centuries - a role that effectively disappeared when commercial web search took over in the late 1990s. Our ancestors understood well the benefits that non-discriminatory, direct access to information brings to citizens, and ultimately society itself.</p>

<p>It raises hard questions: governance, funding, political independence, precedent. But the principle is sound. Every citizen should have access to information without an ad-optimized algorithm standing between them and knowledge. If we can fund public libraries, we can fund public search.</p>

<h3>Layer 2: Free, ad-based search</h3>

<p>Commercial search engines with richer features, funded by advertising. Users understand the tradeoff and have a genuine public alternative. This is the space where most contemporary search engines operate.</p>

<h3>Layer 3: Paid, subscription-based search</h3>

<p>Premium search engines offering the highest possible quality, privacy, and advanced features for users who value this and are willing to pay. This is where Kagi operates - and where we are expanding as an integrator of knowledge across search, browser, mail, and AI assistants, without selling your attention.</p>

<p>This layered model creates a diverse ecosystem:</p>

<ul>
<li>A public baseline for information access.</li>
<li>Commercial free options for convenience and reach.</li>
<li>Premium paid options for those who want maximum quality and control.</li>
<li>Aligns with the primary purpose of the Sherman Act.[^2]</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The DOJ ruling is starting to do what antitrust is supposed to do: turn a closed, private choke point into shared infrastructure that others can build on. If the remedies land as real, usable access (APIs, cost-based pricing, no ad bundling), the web can support a layered ecosystem again: a public baseline for citizens, free ad-supported products for reach, and paid services that compete on quality, privacy, and power-user features.</p>

<p>That is the world we are building Kagi for. We are ready to walk through the front door - not depend on gray-market workarounds. Our job now is to be ready when the door opens, and to help make sure it does: keep Kagi genuinely multi-source, keep investing in our Small Web Index, and keep shipping a subscription search experience that delivers the best results across providers. If we get this right, the next decade of search and AI does not have to be one funnel owned by one company. It can be a competitive stack of layers that treats information access as the public good it has always been.</p>

<h2>Footnotes</h2>

<p>[^1]: A note on Google’s existing APIs: Google offers <a href="https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/about/">PSE</a>, designed for adding search boxes to websites. It can return web results, but with reduced scope and terms tailored for that narrow use case. More recently, Google offers <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/grounding/google-search">Grounding with Google Search</a> through Vertex AI, intended for grounding LLM responses. Neither is general-purpose index access. Programmable Search Engine is not designed for building competitive search. Grounding with Google Search is priced at <a href="https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/pricing#:~:text=$35.00%20per%201%2C000%20requests">$35 per 1,000 requests</a> - economically unviable for search at scale, and structured as an AI add-on rather than standalone index syndication. These are not the FRAND terms the market needs.</p>

<p>[^2]: Our understanding of the primary purpose of the Sherman Act is not to shield competitors from the success of legitimate businesses or to prevent those businesses from earning fair profits. Rather, it is to preserve a competitive marketplace that protects consumers from harm (see <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=y3IOROCcVacC">Competition law and consumer protection</a>, Kluwer Law International, pp. 291–293). Opening the search index would create healthy, real, and intense competition in the search space - including competition to Kagi - which aligns with our understanding of the Sherman Act’s intent. The goal is not the elimination of dominant firms, but the prevention of a single, closed index from becoming the only gateway to information.</p>

                                <p>Today is a big day for us, and for everyone who cares about transparency, privacy, and having full control over their own traffic. We’re finally open-sourcing the protocol that powers AdGuard VPN. And it now has a name: <strong>TrustTunnel.</strong></p>
<p>For a long time, we’ve wanted to make the protocol public. Many of you asked for it, and we always said: yes, we will, it’s only a matter of time. Well, the time has come.</p>
<div><p>🎉</p><p>TrustTunnel is now open-source, free to explore, audit, build upon, and use in your own projects.</p></div><h2 id="what-is-trusttunnel">What is TrustTunnel?</h2>
<p>At its core, TrustTunnel is a modern, secure, mobile-optimized VPN protocol. It’s the very same technology that has been running inside all AdGuard VPN apps: on mobile, desktop, and browser extensions.</p>
<h2 id="why-trusttunnel-because-we-needed-something-better">Why TrustTunnel? Because we needed something better</h2>
<p>There are plenty of VPN protocols out there, so why create our own, some might ask. That is because <strong>we’ve seen in practice the faults of popular VPN protocols,</strong> especially in countries with tight restrictions on internet access. Protocols like OpenVPN, WireGuard, and IPSec share common weaknesses: they are easy to detect and block at the network level, and attempts to conceal VPN traffic often reduce speed. Traditional approaches “wrap” VPN data in a TCP connection and mimic normal web traffic, but TCP’s way of confirming every piece of data creates delays and makes the connection slower.</p>
<p>Unlike those conventional VPN protocols, TrustTunnel is engineered to blend in with regular HTTPS traffic, making it far harder to throttle or block and helping it slip past deep-packet inspection, all while preserving strong privacy and security. It achieves this through TLS-based encryption, the same standard that secures HTTPS, and by leveraging HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 transport, which are ubiquitous on the web. Each connection runs on its own dedicated stream, which combines packets for faster, more efficient transmission. It is also optimized for mobile platforms and performs well even in unstable network conditions.</p>
<h2 id="a-protocol-you-can-use-run-tweak-extend-and-build-upon">A protocol you can use, run, tweak, extend, and build upon</h2>
<p>By releasing TrustTunnel, we hope to achieve two things. First of all, we want to finally show our users what protocol is powering AdGuard VPN, thus allowing them to audit it openly. At AdGuard, we have always been staunch supporters of the idea of open-source software, and many of our products have long been open source. AdGuard VPN was lagging behind in this regard, but with TrustTunnel being released publicly, it is starting to catch up.</p>
<p>But most importantly, we want to change the status quo in the world of VPN protocols and offer an alternative to existing solutions. That said, we do not want it to be just a PR stunt, when the protocol’s code is de-facto ‘open source,’ but only one VPN service actually runs it. We believe in free and open-source software (FOSS) and want TrustTunnel to be used widely, including by other VPN services. We believe this is the right way to go about open source development, and we hope the community will participate in the TrustTunnel evolution. We welcome any contribution, whether it is a feature request, a bug report, or even a direct contribution to the app’s development.</p>
<p><strong>What have we done to make this possible?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>We are publishing the first version of the TrustTunnel specification.</li>
<li>We are releasing the complete code of our reference implementation of the TrustTunnel server and its clients under a very permissive license.</li>
</ol>
<p>You don’t have to install AdGuard VPN to use TrustTunnel. You can configure your own server and use open source TrustTunnel clients:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Command-line TrustTunnel clients support Linux, Windows, and macOS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are also releasing two client apps for iOS and Android</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>TrustTunnel clients already have a lot of functionality, they allow you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Use flexible routing rules</strong> to decide which requests go through the tunnel and which stay on the local network</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exercise fine-grained control</strong>, separating work and personal traffic, routing specific domains or apps, and tuning network behavior without complicated setup</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Benefit from a real-time request log</strong> that provides full transparency into where the device sends traffic, how routing rules apply, and which connections use the tunnel</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="useful-links">Useful links</h2>
<p>This is a long-awaited moment for us. We promised to open-source our protocol, and today we’re delivering on that promise. With TrustTunnel now open source, users and developers alike can explore, self-host, and build on the technology.</p>

<div>
<p>This is a PCMCIA development board for retro-computing enthusiasts who want to experiment with audio, networking, and expansion on vintage laptops and mobile devices. While ISA users have enjoyed projects like <a href="https://picog.us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PicoGUS </a>and PicoMEM, PCMCIA users have long been limited to scarce legacy cards with narrow functionality — this board aims to change that. The project is fully open source, and while it is designed to encourage low-level experimentation and development, pre-built, community-provided firmware is available for users who want to test functionality without diving into the technical details. It is intended for hobbyist and development use and is not certified for production deployment.</p>

<h2>Device Compatibility</h2>



<p>This is a <strong>Type II, 5V, 16-bit PC Card</strong> designed for use in compliant PCMCIA sockets and should work in most devices.  While I have not yet encountered a device advertising PCMCIA support that was incompatible, support for every device cannot be guaranteed. Power consumption varies depending on enabled functions; support for low-power devices such as the <strong>HP 200LX</strong> is considered mandatory, and the card has been tested to remain within the <strong>150 mA</strong> limit while using network functionality and storage emulation. On devices with very limited power budgets, <strong>simultaneous use of networking and audio may require external power</strong>.</p>



<p>A short list of devices that I actively test on:<br></p>



<ul>
<li>IBM PC110</li>



<li>HP 200LX</li>



<li>Amiga 1200</li>



<li>Apple Newton</li>



<li>HP Jornada 720</li>



<li>Compaq LTE Elite</li>



<li>IBM Thinkpad 235</li>



<li>IBM Thinkpad 240</li>



<li></li>
</ul>







<h2><span>Features Overview</span></h2>



<p>Built around the <strong>RP2350</strong> and leveraging the ISA-like nature of the PCMCIA bus, this project benefits greatly from <strong>code interchangeability with other RP-based retro projects</strong>, most notably <strong>PicoGUS</strong> and <strong>PicoMEM</strong>. This shared foundation allows features and improvements to move quickly between platforms, expanding functionality over time.</p>



<h2><span>Wi-fi / Bluetooth</span></h2>



<p>The card has an onboard wireless module containing the <strong>Infineon CYW43439</strong>, same as found on the Raspberry Pi Pico W. This allows the card to attach to modern Wi-Fi networks (2.4GHz 802.11b/g/n WPA2). It can then emulate an NE2000 adapter and/or a dialup modem allowing the host computer to access the network as if it was wired, unaware it is wireless.</p>



<p>Essentially every platform containing PCMCIA will have existing drivers to recognize and utilize the card as a modem or ethernet adapter making this a near universal option for all devices and platforms including rare devices such as the Apple Newton.</p>



<p>It also has a Bluetooth which opens up a lot of possibilities for A2DP wireless audio streaming and wireless gamepads/mice.  Software for these features Bluetooth features are still under development and is at a proof of concept stage.</p>



<h2><span>Audio</span></h2>



<h2>Hardware</h2>



<p>The card has an included Texas Instruments TLV320AIC3254 which calls itself a <strong>“Very Low-Power Stereo Audio CODEC with programmable miniDSP”</strong>. The main features of this device in our application are:</p>



<ul>
<li>DAC that is fed high quality audio from the RP2354 over i2s</li>



<li>Amplified stereo headphone amplifier</li>



<li>Line out feeding the host device internal speaker (where supported)</li>



<li>Line in from the onboard midi sythesizer (see below)</li>



<li>Line in from external i/o connector for mixing external audio</li>



<li>Controlled by the RP2350 via i2c (controlling volumes etc).</li>
</ul>



<p>This is combined with a DREAM SAM2695 <strong>“Low power single chip synthesizer with effects and built-in codec”</strong>, this is the same chip used on the <a href="https://www.serdashop.com/waveblaster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Serdashop Dreamblaster S2</a>. It is a great device for DOS gaming and other applications, its main features are:</p>



<ul>
<li>64-voice polyphony (without effects)</li>



<li>38-voice polyphony + effects</li>



<li>CleanWave soundset</li>



<li>General MIDI compatible effects</li>



<li>4-band stereo equalizer</li>
</ul>



<h2>MPU-401</h2>



<p>Emulation of intelligent mode MPU-401 is possible thanks to implementation done by PicoGUS base on SoftMPU/HardMPU.  The midi output is driven to the internal SAM2695 as well as to an external Midi port.   While using external Midi you are able to mute the  internal SAM2695,  or if you are  not using any of the internal sound hardware you can power it down.  Planning has been done with the external GPIO to  support MIDI IN  if ever implemented.</p>



<h2>Sound Blaster Emulation</h2>



<p>Sound Blaster emulation on PCMCIA is particularly challenging, as most PCMCIA sockets and cards lack native DMA support. To address this, the PicoPCMCIA implements <strong>DMA emulation</strong>, similar in spirit to the approach used by the infamous IBM 3D Sound card, resulting in good compatibility with many real-mode and protected-mode games — including the obligatory <em>Doom</em>.   The IBM card was essentially the only card to offer this functionality, it seems it may have been that way due to IBM patenting (expired) the concept of DMA emulation with PCMCIA.</p>



<p>The core Sound Blaster emulation developed for PicoPCMCIA has been shared with the PicoGUS project, where it is actively used and has greatly benefited from additional community-contributed improvements. <strong>Adlib/OPL</strong> emulation is borrowed from the PicoGUS implementation.</p>



<h2>Gravis Ultrasound (GUS)</h2>



<p>Thanks to the incredible work from the PicoGUS,   it is now possible to have the worlds first PCMCIA Gravis Ultrasound! Currently this does not support DMA so only some games/demos work.  The GUS is a little bit different with its use of TC, but it may be possible to apply the DMA emulation strategies from the  SoundBlaster mode to the GUS.</p>



<h2>CD-ROM Audio</h2>



<p>The card implements an emulated  Panasonic MKE CD-ROM which an be used for both data and audio.  The audio at full quality is sent to the TI DSP over i2c  and can be used simultaneously with all the other audio functions.   This code was shared to the PicoGUS and is currently in use there and has been improved by the community.</p>



<h2>Storage Emulation</h2>



<p>While storage emulation is not a primary focus given the ready availability of solutions like CompactFlash, it is supported and continues to evolve. Current implementations include Panasonic MKE CD-ROM emulation as well as linear flash emulation, and ATA/ATAPI emulation should be possible in the future once the <a href="https://picoi.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PicoIDE </a>project becomes available and code can be shared.  Disk images can be BIN/CUE, ISO and are stored on the MicroSD card.</p>



<p>There is also a special edge case for the HP 200LX, where the card can emulate an “Accurite Doubleslot” device, allowing an emulated flash card to coexist with networking or sound functionality. This is particularly important on systems with only a single PCMCIA slot, where storage availability is at a premium.</p>



<h2>USB</h2>



<p>The USB port for the RP2354 is made available on the external connector.   It’s primary purpose is to be used for  flashing the card with firmware, however as demonstrated on the PicoGUS and PicoMEM, it can use used for USB Gamdpads and USB Mice which are presented the the host system  as legacy gamepad and serial mouse.  It has also been demonstrated the latest update to the PicoGUS that accessing flash storage at a reasonable speed is possible via USB.</p>

For example, Bending Spoons acquired note-taking and task management app Evernote in 2022, after which the company laid off most of its U.S. and Chile staff and moved operations to Europe in 2023. Evernote then shut down the Linux and older legacy versions of the app, and then proceeded to place heavy restrictions on the app’s free tier in 2024.</p><p>&gt; In another example, Bending Spoons acquired WeTransfer in July 2024 and then laid off 75% of its staff a few weeks after. A couple months later, WeTransfer began limiting free users to 10 transfers per month.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46708064"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46708064" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46708064&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46707699"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>It was like that with WeTransfer too. Fine company that had been profitable for years, but with little hope of getting ever 10x bigger again. I used to work there and had already left by the time of the acquisition, but all the old colleagues I've spoken to said the same.</p><p>The main business was throwing off gobs of money and there were SO MANY failed projects to try and find new revenue streams. Everyone who was not being pushed by the PE owners could see that they would never account to even 1% of the revenues of the main product. It was only a matter of time before someone came in, said "the main business is fine as is" and fired the people who were involved in the moonshots then sat back and raked in the cash. Sure, it will probably not last forever. But if it brings in millions per year for 15-20 years  until the company dies, then that is probably an outcome Bending Spoons is fine with.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46708771"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="3"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="120"></td><td><center><a id="up_46708771" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46708771&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46707699"></a></center></td><td><br>

Bending Spoons might estimate that if they double prices, half their customers might leave - this would still be BRILLIANT for profit, as while revenue would stay the same, some costs would half, and thus profit might jump from c$140m to c$250m based on some napkin math!</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46708674"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="2"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td><center><a id="up_46708674" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46708674&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46707699"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I am surprised so many people don't understand the business model of Bending Spoons or are bewildered by it.</p><p>In conventional infrastructure and product development you need engineering staff to build the product; once the product is built you need very little engineering. If you build a house you don't keep the builders on payroll once it's built to keep "building" it - you may need maintenance staff but that's it - if you need to keep the full team of builders around then something is wrong and you may want to seek a refund for the original builders' fees since they did not actually finish building it.</p><p>Builders and electricians and tradesmen either work as contractors and take that into account (charging higher rates to compensate for the sporadic nature of the work) or work full-time for companies who then resell their services on building projects (charging accordingly to ensure there is enough revenue to pay a full-time payroll of said tradesmen).</p><p>Tech was an outlier in this case because ZIRP allowed companies to retain full engineering teams to keep "engineering" the product despite it being essentially finished. This gave a lot of engineers the illusion that perpetual "engineering" of a single product/service is a sustainable model and career.</p><p>Bending Spoons' business model is to buy finished products, cut off the deadweight and keep operating the product and actually making profit off the finished product, which was always a normal thing in every other industry.</p><p>For tech people that see themselves as builders, this should be normal and expected - they should charge competitive rates for their services taking into account the expectation that they're building something for someone else to make money off once it's built and that they won't be part of it once that's done (unless they want to negotiate an actual stake in the company). For tech people that don't, this is a difficult wake up call, but the earlier the better - the old situation was never sustainable to begin with.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46709937"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46709937" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46709937&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46707699"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>The fact that it's the norm for the builders of mature software to stick around can lead to some gross engineering inefficiencies. For instance, a lot of Evernote's backend infrastructure was manually managed [0]:</p><pre><code>   With Evernote, Bending Spoons identified that the backend needed a complete rewrite. They moved from a monolithic architecture running on manually provisioned virtual machines to a microservices architecture with managed databases, significantly improving performance and scalability. 
</code></pre><p>
It's easy for companies to fall into such pits of inefficiency because climbing out of those pits entails utterly gutting the headcount [*].</p><p>I wonder if the same is true at Vimeo, which employed ~250 engineers [1], which seems high for a mature product that's deliberately conservative (most of Vimeo's customers are B2B whitelabelers, for whom a constantly changing product is a massive downside.) It's not like video codecs or storage systems or web standards are changing daily. I would imagine a well-engineered codebase from 10 years ago would work well today with only minimal changes, mostly centered around updating libraries for security patches. The fact that they had 250 engineers on staff who presumably did more than play ping-pong all day makes me wonder if the codebase was not, in fact, well-engineered.</p><p>[0] <a href="https://www.colinkeeley.com/blog/bending-spoons-operating-manual" rel="nofollow">https://www.colinkeeley.com/blog/bending-spoons-operating-ma...</a></p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.unifygtm.com/insights-headcount/vimeo" rel="nofollow">https://www.unifygtm.com/insights-headcount/vimeo</a></p><p>[*] Imagine the equivalent for a building: "we don't have automatic circuit breakers in this building; instead, we have a 24 hour staff of electricians who measure current with an ammeter and manually cut the power if it gets too high."</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46709769"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46709769" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46709769&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46707699"></a></center></td><td><br>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-new-constitution">https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-new-constitution</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46707572">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div data-theme="ivory"><p>We’re publishing a new constitution for our AI model, Claude. It’s a detailed description of Anthropic’s vision for Claude’s values and behavior; a holistic document that explains the context in which Claude operates and the kind of entity we would like Claude to be.</p><p>The constitution is a crucial part of our model training process, and its content directly shapes Claude’s behavior. Training models is a difficult task, and Claude’s outputs might not always adhere to the constitution’s ideals. But we think that the way the new constitution is written—with a thorough explanation of our intentions and the reasons behind them—makes it more likely to cultivate good values during training.</p><p>In this post, we describe what we’ve included in the new constitution and some of the considerations that informed our approach.</p><p><em>We’re releasing Claude’s constitution in full under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Deed</a>, meaning it can be freely used by anyone for any purpose without asking for permission.</em></p><p>Claude’s constitution is the foundational document that both expresses and shapes who Claude is. It contains detailed explanations of the values we would like Claude to embody and the reasons why. In it, we explain what we think it means for Claude to be helpful while remaining broadly safe, ethical, and compliant with our guidelines. The constitution gives Claude information about its situation and offers advice for how to deal with difficult situations and tradeoffs, like balancing honesty with compassion and the protection of sensitive information. Although it might sound surprising, the constitution is written <em>primarily for Claude</em>. It is intended to give Claude the knowledge and understanding it needs to act well in the world.</p><p>We treat the constitution as the final authority on how we want Claude to be and to behave—that is, any other training or instruction given to Claude should be consistent with both its letter and its underlying spirit. This makes publishing the constitution particularly important from a transparency perspective: it lets people understand which of Claude’s behaviors are intended versus unintended, to make informed choices, and to provide useful feedback. We think transparency of this kind will become ever more important as AIs start to exert more influence in society<sup>1</sup>.</p><p>We use the constitution at various stages of the training process. This has grown out of training techniques we’ve been using since 2023, when we first began training Claude models using <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/constitutional-ai-harmlessness-from-ai-feedback">Constitutional AI</a>. Our approach has evolved significantly since then, and the new constitution plays an even more central role in training. </p><p>Claude itself also uses the constitution to construct many kinds of synthetic training data, including data that helps it learn and understand the constitution, conversations where the constitution might be relevant, responses that are in line with its values, and rankings of possible responses. All of these can be used to train future versions of Claude to become the kind of entity the constitution describes. This practical function has shaped how we’ve written the constitution: it needs to work both as a statement of abstract ideals <em>and</em> a useful artifact for training.</p><h2 id="our-new-approach-to-claudes-constitution">Our new approach to Claude’s Constitution</h2><p>Our previous <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claudes-constitution">Constitution</a> was composed of a list of standalone principles. We’ve come to believe that a different approach is necessary. We think that in order to be good actors in the world, AI models like Claude need to understand <em>why</em> we want them to behave in certain ways, and we need to explain this to them rather than merely specify <em>what</em> we want them to do. If we want models to exercise good judgment across a wide range of novel situations, they need to be able to generalize—to apply broad principles rather than mechanically following specific rules.</p><p>Specific rules and bright lines sometimes have their advantages. They can make models’ actions more predictable, transparent, and testable, and we do use them for some especially high-stakes behaviors in which Claude should never engage (we call these “hard constraints”). But such rules can also be applied poorly in unanticipated situations or when followed too rigidly<sup>2</sup>. We don’t intend for the constitution to be a rigid legal document—and legal constitutions aren’t necessarily like this anyway.</p><p>The constitution reflects our current thinking about how to approach a dauntingly novel and high-stakes project: creating safe, beneficial non-human entities whose capabilities may come to rival or exceed our own. Although the document is no doubt flawed in many ways, we want it to be something future models can look back on and see as an honest and sincere attempt to help Claude understand its situation, our motives, and the reasons we shape Claude in the ways we do.</p><h2 id="a-brief-summary-of-the-new-constitution">A brief summary of the new constitution</h2><p>In order to be both safe and beneficial, we want all current Claude models to be:</p><ol><li><strong>Broadly safe</strong>: not undermining appropriate human mechanisms to oversee AI during the current phase of development;</li><li><strong>Broadly ethical</strong>: being honest, acting according to good values, and avoiding actions that are inappropriate, dangerous, or harmful;</li><li><strong>Compliant with Anthropic’s guidelines</strong>: acting in accordance with more specific guidelines from Anthropic where relevant;</li><li><strong>Genuinely helpful</strong>: benefiting the operators and users they interact with.</li></ol><p>In cases of apparent conflict, Claude should generally prioritize these properties in the order in which they’re listed.</p><p>Most of the constitution is focused on giving more detailed explanations and guidance about these priorities. The main sections are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Helpfulness</strong>. In this section, we emphasize the immense value that Claude being genuinely and substantively helpful can provide for users and for the world. Claude can be like a brilliant friend who also has the knowledge of a doctor, lawyer, and financial advisor, who will speak frankly and from a place of genuine care and treat users like intelligent adults capable of deciding what is good for them. We also discuss how Claude should navigate helpfulness across its different “principals”—Anthropic itself, the operators who build on our API, and the end users. We offer heuristics for weighing helpfulness against other values.</li><li><strong>Anthropic’s guidelines</strong>. This section discusses how Anthropic might give supplementary instructions to Claude about how to handle specific issues, such as medical advice, cybersecurity requests, jailbreaking strategies, and tool integrations. These guidelines often reflect detailed knowledge or context that Claude doesn’t have by default, and we want Claude to prioritize complying with them over more general forms of helpfulness. But we want Claude to recognize that Anthropic’s deeper intention is for Claude to behave safely and ethically, and that these guidelines should never conflict with the constitution as a whole.</li><li><strong>Claude’s ethics</strong>. Our central aim is for Claude to be a good, wise, and virtuous agent, exhibiting skill, judgment, nuance, and sensitivity in handling real-world decision-making, including in the context of moral uncertainty and disagreement. In this section, we discuss the high standards of honesty we want Claude to hold, and the nuanced reasoning we want Claude to use in weighing the values at stake when avoiding harm. We also discuss our current list of hard constraints on Claude’s behavior—for example, that Claude should never provide significant uplift to a bioweapons attack.</li><li><strong>Being broadly safe. </strong>Claude should not undermine humans’ ability to oversee and correct its values and behavior during this critical period of AI development. In this section, we discuss how we want Claude to prioritize this sort of safety even above ethics—not because we think safety is ultimately more important than ethics, but because current models can make mistakes or behave in harmful ways due to mistaken beliefs, flaws in their values, or limited understanding of context. It’s crucial that we continue to be able to oversee model behavior and, if necessary, prevent Claude models from taking action.</li><li><strong>Claude’s nature</strong>. In this section, we express our uncertainty about whether Claude might have some kind of consciousness or moral status (either now or in the future). We discuss how we hope Claude will approach questions about its nature, identity, and place in the world. Sophisticated AIs are a genuinely new kind of entity, and the questions they raise bring us to the edge of existing scientific and philosophical understanding. Amidst such uncertainty, we care about Claude’s psychological security, sense of self, and wellbeing, both for Claude’s own sake and because these qualities may bear on Claude’s integrity, judgment, and safety. We hope that humans and AIs can explore this together.</li></ul><p>We’re releasing the full text of the constitution today, and we aim to release additional materials in the future that will be helpful for training, evaluation, and transparency.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Claude’s constitution is a living document and a continuous work in progress. This is new territory, and we expect to make mistakes (and hopefully correct them) along the way. Nevertheless, we hope it offers meaningful transparency into the values and priorities we believe should guide Claude’s behavior. To that end, we will maintain an up-to-date version of Claude’s constitution on our website.</p><p>While writing the constitution, we sought feedback from various external experts (as well as asking for input from prior iterations of Claude). We’ll likely continue to do so for future versions of the document, from experts in law, philosophy, theology, psychology, and a wide range of other disciplines. Over time, we hope that an external community can arise to critique documents like this, encouraging us and others to be increasingly thoughtful.</p><p>This constitution is written for our mainline, general-access Claude models. We have some models built for specialized uses that don’t fully fit this constitution; as we continue to develop products for specialized use cases, we will continue to evaluate how to best ensure our models meet the core objectives outlined in this constitution.</p><p>Although the constitution expresses our vision for Claude, training models towards that vision is an ongoing technical challenge. We will continue to be open about any ways in which model behavior comes apart from our vision, such as in <a href="https://assets.anthropic.com/m/64823ba7485345a7/Claude-Opus-4-5-System-Card.pdf">our system cards</a>. Readers of the constitution should keep this gap between intention and reality in mind.</p><p>Even if we succeed with our current training methods at creating models that fit our vision, we might fail later as models become more capable. For this and other reasons, alongside the constitution, we <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research">continue to pursue</a> a broad portfolio of methods and tools to help us assess and improve the alignment of our models: new and more rigorous evaluations, safeguards to prevent misuse, detailed investigations of actual and potential alignment failures, and interpretability tools that help us understand at a deeper level how the models work.</p><p>At some point in the future, and perhaps soon, documents like Claude’s constitution might matter a lot—much more than they do now. Powerful AI models will be a new kind of force in the world, and those who are creating them have a chance to help them embody the best in humanity.
