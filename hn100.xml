            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://adamjones.me/blog/dont-use-contact-forms/">https://adamjones.me/blog/dont-use-contact-forms/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40256868">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><em>This article is written solely in my personal capacity, and does not represent the views of any organisations I am affiliated with.</em></p><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Contact forms are almost always worse for users than just putting an email on your website. I explore why they’re terrible, why you’ve done it anyway, and what to do about it.</p>

<h3 id="your-contact-form-is-completely-broken">Your contact form is completely broken</h3>
<p>It’s remarkable how many contact forms are just straight-up broken. A WordPress upgrade here, a change to your CRM there, and your contact form silently breaks.</p>
<p>At time of writing, B&amp;Q’s contact form just plainly doesn’t work<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>. I am fairly amazed that a retailer with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%26Q">revenues in the billions</a> doesn’t notice written queries have stopped coming in.</p>
<p><img src="https://adamjones.me/images/blog/dont-use-contact-forms/bandq.png" alt="B&amp;Q Contact form, with an error box saying 'Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again.'"></p>
<p>(as a side note: your form should have <a href="https://wix-ux.com/when-life-gives-you-lemons-write-better-error-messages-46c5223e1a2f">better error messages</a>. The error above gives the user no way out, given that trying again would not help)</p>
<p>This is not an isolated incident. I’ve been stung by broken contact forms on all kinds of websites, from many other big and small organisations. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38554522">AWS’s abuse contact form has been broken for months</a>. And here’s a particularly gnarly example from <a href="https://www.elastoplast.co.uk/pages/contact">Elastoplast</a>, one of the largest plaster brands in the UK:</p>
<p><img src="https://adamjones.me/images/blog/dont-use-contact-forms/elastoplast.png" alt="Elastoplast contact form with a very long error message that looks like a stacktrace displayed, beginning 'CrmApi.Client.Common.HttpStatusException: Failed with status InternalServerError...'"></p>
<h3 id="your-contact-form-is-broken-for-some-users">Your contact form is broken for some users</h3>
<p>Axa, an insurer with almost <a href="https://www.axa-im.com/who-we-are/axa-im-numbers">a trillion euros of assets under management</a>, offers <a href="https://customer.axa.co.uk/contact/email-general/">a contact form</a> that looks like it’s time travelled from the early 2000s. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like that time has made it work better: it incorrectly rejects some valid emails<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> and doesn’t show all the relevant Axa products.</p>
<p><img src="https://adamjones.me/images/blog/dont-use-contact-forms/axa.png" alt="AXA's contact form, showing the email test+test@example.com being rejected, and listing only four insurance products in the dropdown"></p>
<p>Vodafone, a major UK mobile network, has <a href="https://www.vodafone.co.uk/webcenter/portal/myvodafone/lostandstolen">a form to report devices lost and stolen</a>. However, their site is frequently unavailable for maintenance overnight. I can’t imagine how frustrating having a phone stolen, only to try to report it and be presented with this:</p>
<p><img src="https://adamjones.me/images/blog/dont-use-contact-forms/vodafone.png" alt="A page with Vodafone branding saying 'Sorry, we're down for schduled maintenance right now'"></p>
<p>Finally, a lot of contact forms do not meet basic web accessibility standards, making it hard for assistive technology users to properly complete them. For example, <a href="https://www.virginmedia.com/help/virgin-mobile-complaint">Virgin Mobile’s complaint page</a> is nearly unnavigable by keyboard due to hiding any kind of selection indicators.</p>
<h3 id="your-contact-form-takes-ages-to-fill-out">Your contact form takes ages to fill out</h3>
<p>I’m not sure how it’s been achieved, but the <a href="https://forms.charitycommission.gov.uk/Complaints-to-the-Charity-Commission-for-England-and-Wales/">UK’s Charity Commission’s complaints form</a> takes about 6-7 seconds to load every single page! It offers no indication of progress, and you have to get through 11 pages to complete it.</p>
<p><img src="https://adamjones.me/images/blog/dont-use-contact-forms/cc-slow.png" alt="The Chrome network tab, showing a request taking 6.85 seconds"></p>
<p>At this rate, you spend <strong>75 seconds</strong> just waiting for pages in the form to load.</p>
<p>And that’s not including the time to answer the questions asked - or even processing some of them. Don’t worry, you’ll get to review each one carefully because none of them have <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete">autocomplete attributes</a> set.</p>
<p>You’ll also have to read through all the options in this monstrosity of a dropdown - which is helpfully not grouped or sorted in any coherent way:</p>
<p><img src="https://adamjones.me/images/blog/dont-use-contact-forms/cc-dropdown.png" alt="A dropdown with 28 options such as 'Trustee', 'Employee', 'Press/Media', 'Donor', 'Auditor', 'PHSO', 'Umbrella Organisation' and 'Other'"></p>
<p>(Additionally, this question doesn’t make sense to ask in the first place. The complaint is about a service by the Charity Commission, after answering ‘No’ to the question ‘Does your question or query relate to a specific registered charity?’)</p>
<h3 id="your-contact-form-asks-for-irrelevant-personal-information">Your contact form asks for irrelevant personal information</h3>
<p>National Grid has <a href="https://www.nationalgrid.co.uk/contact-us/contacting-national-grid-electricity-distribution/general-contact-enquiries">contact</a> and <a href="https://www.nationalgrid.co.uk/contact-us/contacting-national-grid-electricity-distribution/feedback-and-compliments">feedback</a> forms.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-3" id="user-content-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> I might want to give them some minor feedback like ‘hey this link on your site is broken’, however I then need to figure out whether I really want to provide all my personal details to do this - like my home address and phone number (or at least make up something that looks plausible).</p>
<p>I’ve also seen some complaints forms asking for more sensitive data, like date of birth or copies of ID documents. Sometimes this is despite them not holding this information in the first place, so they’re not comparing it to what they have on record as a security measure.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-4" id="user-content-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup></p>
<p>You do need to collect some contact details, but do you really need <strong>three</strong> different contact methods to respond to some off-hand feedback? Other things you probably don’t actually need on a general contact form include <a href="https://writefulcopy.com/blog/why-title-should-not-be-a-required-field-on-online-forms">title</a>, job function, company size, and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56831212">landline</a> number.</p>
<p>This unnecessarily increases the risk of my data being stolen and used for identity fraud. For less trustworthy organisations, this also directly increases the chance I get spam - so I either don’t submit the form, or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/1b6up7p/does_anyone_actually_give_their_email_address/">make up data</a>.</p>
<h3 id="your-contact-form-is-less-useful-for-customers">Your contact form is less useful for customers</h3>
<p>Email allows customers to create drafts, schedule messages, and easily keep a record of what’s been said. It also often integrates into their workflows more easily, for example the ability to <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7622010">snooze emails</a> to chase up on them later.</p>
<p>Your form likely doesn’t have any of these features. In fact, even if it’s fully working users often don’t get any form of confirmation they can refer back to later, let alone a confirmation that contains all the details they submitted.</p>
<p>I’m not certain there is malicious intent behind it, but I have experienced several companies ‘accidentally’ losing form submissions, only to mysteriously find them again once I pull up copies of the form I saved a screenshot of. If you’re forcing your customers to do this, you’re doing it wrong.</p>
<h3 id="your-contact-form-is-wasting-your-resources">Your contact form is wasting your resources</h3>
<p>It takes time and energy to build and maintain a contact form properly. It almost always gets routed to an email behind the scenes (or a system that accepts email), so skip the middleman and put up the email address!</p>
<p>It also can mean that customers contacting you can’t remember what their original message was about. I’ve experienced getting a response from an organisation and then having to ask them what the original query was about - had this been an email in the first place this could have been avoided.</p>
<h3 id="your-contact-form-is-irritating-in-other-ways">Your contact form is irritating in other ways</h3>
<p>There are probably hundreds of ways you could set up your contact form to be maximally irritating, and I can’t cover them all here. I’ll leave you with one final example that doesn’t fit into the categories above though.</p>
<p>Sainsbury’s has a <a href="https://help.sainsburys.co.uk/help/contact-us">contact form</a> that forces you to navigate down a long options tree. Only to open a modal and ask you to select the topic again. They then present the tiniest form window ever, which makes it near impossible to fill out:</p>
<p><img src="https://adamjones.me/images/blog/dont-use-contact-forms/sainsburys.gif" alt="Contact form displayed in a modal with limited vertical height, such that only 1-2 fields of about 20 are visible at any time"></p>
<h2 id="why-youve-done-this-and-what-to-do-instead">Why you’ve done this, and what to do instead</h2>
<p>Beyond just ‘it’s what we’ve always done’, there are a few reasons you might think a contact form is a good idea. Here we’ll go through some of them and what you might do instead.</p>
<h3 id="to-collect-structured-data-that-speeds-up-resolving-problems">To collect structured data that speeds up resolving problems</h3>
<p>You might want to use a contact form to collect structured data, so it saves you time processing requests. For example, making sure the customer provides the right identifiers for you to find them on your systems quickly, or automatically assigning queries to the right teams.</p>
<p>This <em>can</em> be okay in some circumstances. Amazon does this well: it shows you the recent items you’ve purchased and also allows you to completely self-serve common customer service workflows (like requesting a return) - while still allowing you to speak to a human fairly easily.</p>
<p>However, unless you’ve got an excellent customer service portal (you probably don’t), you should just stick with an email for general contact purposes.</p>
<p>To make sure you have the right details, just set up a sensible auto-reply. Here’s a good example from GP at hand:<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-5" id="user-content-fnref-5" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup></p>
<p><img src="https://adamjones.me/images/blog/dont-use-contact-forms/gpathand-autoreply.png" alt="An autoresponder email stating 'If you haven't already, please ensure you have provided us with your full name, postal address and a contact phone number'"></p>
<p>Next, before automating assigning queries to the right teams, consider whether you need to do this: I’ve seen very small teams try to justify ‘a contact form will help us categorise emails’ when they receive two emails a day, or they all go to the same person anyways.</p>
<p>If you really do need to automate assigning emails, take a look at platforms like <a href="https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5608652527386-Getting-started-with-Zendesk-AI-and-Advanced-AI#h_01HH0BTYYBV6ETWHG8779M9Y8C">Zendesk and their AI systems</a> - this kind of thing is exactly what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">LLMs</a> thrive at (or often just <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions">regular expressions</a> will get you far enough).</p>
<h3 id="you-want-people-to-contact-you-and-think-your-form-will-lower-the-barrier">You want people to contact you, and think your form will lower the barrier</h3>
<p>Empirically, this doesn’t hold up. I previously thought this was true, but I’ve since seen at 3 different organisations who’ve made the switch that this doesn’t seem to be the case - i.e. they get the same number of genuine contacts by listing an email as having a contact form. I’d love to rigorously analyse and publish the data on this to help convince others.</p>
<p>One category where this might not be true by default is for very ‘low-effort’ feedback forms. I think this can probably be mitigated by making it clear that you’re friendly and would be happy to receive informal emails.</p>
<p>The other category where I think this might be more likely to lower the barrier is where people prefer to be anonymous. For example, someone who might not be public about their sexual orientation might not want to have related comments so easily linked back to them, but still want to give feedback on some article. The UK Government website, GOV.UK, has a delightfully simple example that works well for collecting anonymous feedback:</p>
<p><img src="https://adamjones.me/images/blog/dont-use-contact-forms/govuk-feedback.png" alt="Form titled 'Help us improve GOV.UK', with two questions: 'What were you doing?' and 'What went wrong?'"></p>
<h3 id="youre-worried-youll-get-spam-if-you-list-an-email-online">You’re worried you’ll get spam if you list an email online</h3>
<p>Surprisingly, not really. I found we often ended up getting <em>less</em> spam compared to WordPress forms - there might be something about it being easier to submit anonymous forms with rubbish, compared to actually sending emails with decent enough reputation to get past today's spam filters.</p>
<p>If you really worry about this, you can <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/235937/does-e-mail-address-obfuscation-actually-work">obfuscate your email from spam bots</a>. But I think this is usually wasted time given just how rare this kind of email spam is, and how good spam filters have gotten. Plus this risks you messing this up and breaking something.</p>
<h3 id="you-want-to-manage-messages-as-a-team">You want to manage messages as a team</h3>
<p>You can do this with email! Hook up a <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/open-and-use-a-shared-mailbox-in-outlook-d94a8e9e-21f1-4240-808b-de9c9c088afd">shared mailbox</a>, <a href="https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/167430">collaborative inbox</a>, or one of the many off-the-shelf customer service solutions like <a href="https://www.zendesk.co.uk/service/ticketing-system/customer-service-email-management-software/">Zendesk</a>, <a href="https://www.zoho.com/desk/">Zoho Desk</a>, <a href="https://www.freshworks.com/freshdesk/">Freshdesk</a>, <a href="https://zammad.org/">Zammad</a>, <a href="https://osticket.com/">osTicket</a>, or <a href="https://freescout.net/">FreeScout</a> to your email.</p>
<h3 id="you-think-email-isnt-secure-enough">You think email isn’t secure enough</h3>
<p>Email used to be very insecure because it wasn’t encrypted.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-6" id="user-content-fnref-6" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">6</a></sup> This meant that people between mail servers could read the contents of messages.</p>
<p>However, unless you’ve done something weird with your email setup, it’ll probably be encrypted securely like <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/safer-email/overview">99% of other email traffic</a> is in 2024.</p>
<p>In theory, your customer might be using an email provider that doesn’t support encryption - which could lead them to sending something to you insecurely and putting them at risk. I think most organisations can accept this risk given how rare this is, given that this is on the customer’s end. For what it’s worth, the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/organisation/ncsc">is happy to list a contact email for themselves</a>.</p>
<p>Another question to ask yourself if you don’t list an email for this reason: do you respond via email after people contact you?</p>
<h3 id="you-think-email-isnt-accessible-to-assistive-technology-users">You think email isn't accessible to assistive technology users</h3>
<p>I've heard the claim that you need a contact form to be compliant with some common accessibility standard - this is simply not true. If you don't beleive me, try and actually find this rule.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-7" id="user-content-fnref-7" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Listing an email is almost certainly easier to parse and understand than your contact form.</p>
<h3 id="you-dont-want-people-to-fill-in-your-form">You don't want people to fill in your form</h3>
<p>Yeah - this is one I'm not really here to help you with.</p>
<p>There are some organisations that intentionally want their form to be difficult to complete - perhaps it’s a regulatory requirement that you don’t really want to comply with. If you’re doing this, you should probably feel bad.</p>
<p>It’s unclear how intentional this is, but in this vein Meta (Facebook) makes it very difficult to contact them about data protection matters. Some charities <a href="https://noyb.eu/en/no-bullsht-opt-out-free-noyb-tool-quick-and-broad-facebook-objections">have already highlighted</a> that Meta’s forms seem to be particularly difficult to find, and difficult to complete. My own experiences with this process have been complex and drawn out, having been referred to several different broken forms.</p>
<p>Regulators should be doing a better job ensuring they are setting the bar appropriately in these cases, in a way that rewards actors who are complying with both the letter and spirit of laws or regulations.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Contact forms are hard to get right, and often just a worse experience for everyone involved. Go forth and remove your contact form and list your email on your website now!</p>
<section data-footnotes="true">
<ol>
<li id="user-content-fn-1">
<p>As in, it’s impossible to submit from the website - the error appears when submitting. Inspecting the network requests suggests this error is because a ‘title’ property is missing: likely some mismatch between the backend and the frontend (there is no title field on the frontend). Yes, these problems happen in software development from time to time: but there’s no need to incur this if email already ‘just works’. <a href="#user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 1">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="user-content-fn-2">
<p><code>test+test@example.com</code>, <code>tést@example.com</code> and <code>test@éxample.com</code> are all valid emails as per <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6532">RFC 6532</a>, but are all rejected by this form <a href="#user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 2">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="user-content-fn-3">
<p>As a fun side bonus, if you make a single mistake on this form it deletes everything and forces you to start from scratch. For example, if you format your phone number ‘wrong’, your entire message you typed up is wiped. <a href="#user-content-fnref-3" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 3">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="user-content-fn-4">
<p>I don't think people's birthdays should be a security measure, but unfortunately it seems to be the world we live in. I'll have to explore this in another rant. <a href="#user-content-fnref-4" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 4">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="user-content-fn-5">
<p>It could probably place this a bit more prominently by cutting some of the other stuff, but on the whole the message is fairly clear and not an unreasonable length. <a href="#user-content-fnref-5" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 5">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="user-content-fn-6">
<p>There are also other email security risks, such as email spoofing (solvable with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMARC">DMARC</a>!). But on the whole, the email security risk seems overblown (especially compared to 'crappy WordPress form' security risk). <a href="#user-content-fnref-6" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 6">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="user-content-fn-7">
<p>Further examples that would seem to suggest that this is not necessary is that the following organisations list an email to contact them: <a href="https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/contact-us">Equality and Human Rights Commission</a> (the public body responsible for disability rights), <a href="https://www.scope.org.uk/contact-us/">Scope</a> (a major disability equality charity) and <a href="https://abilitynet.org.uk/how-contact-us">AbilityNet</a> (a charity building assistive technologies). <a href="#user-content-fnref-7" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 7">↩</a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>It was the 28th of June, 2020; the perfect summer day. I remember it distinctly because of two important events that took place on that day. The first was the unfortunate discovery that I am highly sensitive to the venomous hairs of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_processionary">Oak processionary</a> caterpillar. If you’ve never wished you could use a cheese grater to remove the skin off your arms and legs just to be rid of the itching, then you can’t really understand how I felt for two whole weeks that summer.</p><p>The second thing that happened on that 28th of June was the seemingly inconsequential purchase of two secondhand bicycles. My wife and I drove out to a local park to test ride a couple of ’90s-era Trek 970 bikes that a guy had restored in his garage. We didn’t know a thing about bicycles, but we liked what we saw; the bikes worked great and felt very nice to ride around the park–the fact that I also happened to ride through a floating cloud of Oak-processionary hairs would only become apparent the next day.</p><p>So we took our new old bikes home, and we started riding them around. We got into bicycle touring too around that time, and that’s worth an entire future post on its own for the joy it’s brought us, but for now I’d like to get back on track. See, I kept thinking about the guy we bought the bikes from. I don’t know if he did this as a hobby, side business, or what, but I became increasingly fascinated by the idea of fixing up and restoring old bicycles. As I said, at that time I didn’t know a thing about bikes; I couldn’t even change a brake cable, but I’d always wanted to pick up a hobby that would take me away from the computer, something that would get my hards dirty at the same time, so why not give this a try?</p><p>Back then I still had my previous bike too, gathering dust and cobwebs somewhere in the basement. It was a Cube Aim that I’d had for at least a decade and had practically never serviced. It worked like crap, but I suspected most of it was just lack of maintenance and proper adjustment. In fact, it was in a lot of ways a nicer bike than the one I’d just bought. So I set a goal for myself: I would take the bike apart, down to the last bolt; I would clean everything up, change whatever parts were broken, and put it back together again. After all, how hard could it be?</p><p>At its core, a bike is a very simple, very old machine. The basic operating principles have remained virtually unchanged since the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_bicycle">“safety bicycle”</a> of the late 19th century: you push on the pedals to rotate a crank arm; a chain transfers the power to the rear sprockets; the sprockets turn the rear wheel. That’s it, that’s all there is to it; a wonderfully simple device that is nonetheless the single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_performance#Energy_efficiency">most energy-efficient</a> mode of transportation humanity has come up with.</p><p>Of course, modern bikes are a lot more complicated than that: inflatable tires; the freewheel; derailleurs; suspension; hydraulic disk brakes; electric motors and electronic gear shifting. Every major technological advancement has brought with it increased safety, ease of use, and performance, at the cost of adding extra layers of complexity on top of the basic initial machine. It’s increasingly rare now for people to know how to repair their own bicycles, and bicycle mechanics themselves have more and more skills to learn if they want to keep on top of the fast changes in their field.</p><p>Which brings me back to my modest Cube. I grossly underestimated just how complex a task I’d set for myself, of course, but at the same time I also underestimated just how much I would love doing it. I had never considered myself mechanically inclined; my dad didn’t teach me much, and by that time I hadn’t yet truly internalized something that has since become one of my main mantras in life: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4J_QfiGRRc">what one man can do, another can do</a> (by the way, if you haven’t watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119051/">The Edge</a> yet, you really should). Thankfully, we live in glorious informational times that our forefathers didn’t even dream of. A trove of knowledge of incalculable value is available at the fingertips of every self-learner, and bicycle repair is no exception. YouTube channels like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzaZ1sPWEuZN-I8_XT6AH8g">Park Tool</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaAK2FaxQ2xiBbAUVZsvDYQ">RJ The Bike Guy</a> provide a visual, hands-on learning experience that is comparable to the tragically fading practice of apprenticeship. Internet forums like <a href="http://reddit.com/r/bikewrench">/r/bikewrench</a> give one the ability to pick the brains of real-life professional mechanics (although, just like every other subreddit, it does have its idiots that one needs to learn to steer clear of), and no list of bike repair resources could be complete without mentioning <em>the Bible</em>, the website of the late <a href="https://www.sheldonbrown.com/">Sheldon Brown</a>. May he rest in peace.</p><p>Eventually, I finished the project. It didn’t go smoothly at all. On more than one occasion I realized I was missing some vital tool, or some tiny part that I hadn’t even known existed until I suddenly needed it–like <a href="https://tegowerk.eu/img/2022-02-04-repair/EfCKYf2.jpg">cable ferrules</a>, or a <a href="https://tegowerk.eu/img/2022-02-04-repair/UqbJC1q.png">star nut</a>–and without which the whole project ground to a halt. Nevertheless, the bike progressed, then finally it was done, and from that moment on I knew I was hooked. I’ve been working as a web developer since 2006. Coding has always been my great passion. I have literally lost count of the number of apps and projects I worked on for the past sixteen years. But let me tell you something: not a single launch has given me the same high, has been as memorable or as character-defining as rebuilding that cheap bicycle in 2020; I simply had to have more of it.</p><p>Almost two years have passed since then. I’ve rebuilt almost twenty more bikes in that time. I’ve learned to reliably <a href="https://www.wheelpro.co.uk/wheelbuilding/book.php">build wheels</a>, and I’ve become the go-to guy for bike repair in my circle of friends–and even for some folks who I didn’t even know before. There isn’t a single bicycle repair task that scares me anymore. I’ve gone from not being able to change a brake cable, to bravely <a href="https://tegowerk.eu/posts/sram-automatix/">taking apart complex components</a> or <a href="https://tegowerk.eu/posts/drop-bar-shifter-tutorial/">hacking them</a> for use-cases that they weren’t designed for. We have since sold the bikes we bought back in 2020, and both my wife and I are now riding bikes that I’ve built from scratch. The pride I feel when we go out on a ride cannot be overstated, and I love biking now more than I ever did as a result.</p><p>I realize this may sound overblown, but the changes this hobby has wrought in me go beyond just teaching me a fun and useful skill. Learning to fix bicycles has changed my outlook on manual labor, on the nature of work, and ultimately on life itself:</p><h3 id="thinking-versus-doing">Thinking versus doing</h3><p>Looking back, I realize I had a terribly naive perspective on manual labor. I lived with the misconception–drilled into me since childhood–that work can be neatly split into two categories: knowledge work and manual work; that there are those who think, and those who do, and by extension (and it greatly shames me to admit this) that there is a clear difference in value between the two.</p><p>I have since realized that the line that separates thinking from doing doesn’t actually exist; instead, the two are facets of the same coin, and neither can exist in isolation. This came to me when I noticed that there is just as much thinking going into solving a bike repair problem as there is in solving a bug in my code (and, incidentally, the same high when I finally crack it). I later ended up reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6261332-shop-class-as-soulcraft">Shop Class as Soulcraft: An Inquiry Into the Value of Work</a>, by Matthew B. Crawford; it was an eye-opening read that eloquently put into words a concept I had merely sniffed the edges of. I highly recommend you give it a read.</p><h3 id="what-one-man-can-do-another-can-do">What one man can do, another can do</h3><p>I touched on this a bit earlier in the text. I have a lot more courage now in tackling all sorts of repairs around the house, not just on bikes. This is because I now know that I have the capacity to learn the necessary skills, but more importantly, it’s because I’ve learned to look at objects and <em>see them</em>. Something has shifted inside me, and it has altered my perception of the world. Before, I used to look at an object and only see it on the surface; I saw the function it performed and nothing more. Now I see the bolts, the screws, the cables, the hinges, the motors, and I know that each one of those can be fixed or replaced independently of the object as a whole. Maybe this has always been obvious to you, but as I’ve already said, I didn’t learn much of this stuff growing up; it’s a failing I put on my shoulders and the shoulders of my father both, and it’s something I’m only truly making up for now, in the fourth decade of my life. Better late than never.</p><h3 id="tangibility-of-objects-and-people">Tangibility, of objects and people</h3><p>At work I build websites. Well, that’s not strictly true. I build web apps, I write unit tests, I manage databases, I architect and set up the cloud infrastucture, I set up continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines, and sometimes I even help my colleagues fix the Docker setup on their machines. My daily conversations are peppered with such acronyms as PHP, TDD, CI, CD, K8s, SQL, JSON, AWS, GCP, CF, SSH, SSL, and on and on and on.</p><p>If you’re not an IT person, most of these words won’t mean anything to you, and therein lies my next point. Conceptually, it’s easier for humans to relate to occupations that produce something you can point a finger at. The further removed a person is from the results of their own work, the greater the disconnect they feel, and the greater the chance they’ll conclude they’re working in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_job">bullshit job</a>.</p><p>Now, I don’t actually believe I’m working a bullshit job. I don’t really believe they exist. I believe jobs provide value even when the value is not immediately, tangibly apparent. But I do believe in the disconnect that makes people feel this way, and I do believe that’s a distinct hallmark of the modern service-oriented industries. You’ll never hear a baker say their job is bullshit.</p><p>And it’s not just the tangible aspect of the work itself, either. The same can be said of the people who ultimately benefit from the work. Websites that I’ve built are being used right now by hundreds of thousands of people, yet for some reason I still feel I’m making a greater impact when I see a person ride away on a bike I’ve just repaired for them. It’s senseless, yet there it is.</p></article></div>]]></description>

<h2>It’s actually kinda working</h2>



<div><p>So, about a year ago I joined a bunch of a landlord groups on Facebook and Nextdoor. I’ve worked diligently to manipulate them into taking pro-tenant actions, and it actually has kind of worked? Here’s the general strategy:</p><figure><img title="noun-landlord-111368 » This is a lot" decoding="async" width="512" height="512" src="https://www.thisisalot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/noun-landlord-111368.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.thisisalot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/noun-landlord-111368.png 512w, https://www.thisisalot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/noun-landlord-111368-300x300.png 300w, https://www.thisisalot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/noun-landlord-111368-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></figure></div>







<ol>
<li>Make some posts detailing how I run my “businesss”<sup data-fn="6a55418c-f453-4de4-a1a6-4282352192ef"><a id="6a55418c-f453-4de4-a1a6-4282352192ef-link" href="#6a55418c-f453-4de4-a1a6-4282352192ef">1</a></sup> and ask a few questions.</li>



<li>Establish credibility by earning their trust by posting helpful information. </li>



<li>Politely suggest taking actions that unequivocally benefit the tenant by dressing them up as beneficial to the landlord.  </li>
</ol>



<p>These three steps, of which order matters a lot, have given me a few wins I’d like to share with y’all. </p>



<h2>Establishing your credentials by lying </h2>



<p>Landlords won’t listen to tenants. In the same way that Republicans won’t seriously engage with Democrats and <em>vice versa</em>. The two roles are viewed as kind of adversarial, so going directly into trying to change their behavior is not a  going proposition. </p>



<p>However, <em>all</em> humans listen to people that they think are like themselves. Naturally, we place more weight on people with whom we have a common reference point. This shared reference binds us together, and its through those ties that bind you can persuade effectively. So, the first move was to convince them that I am in fact a landlord<sup data-fn="d458854b-cbc0-43c7-a9c3-cc614f72f476"><a href="#d458854b-cbc0-43c7-a9c3-cc614f72f476" id="d458854b-cbc0-43c7-a9c3-cc614f72f476-link">2</a></sup>.</p>



<p>So, when the question was posed “do you own a property?” when I applied to join the group, I chose a random 2-flat at the other end of my street and said “yes”. </p>



<h2>Asking Questions to get your name out there</h2>



<p>When I was still new in the groups, I asked some questions about common landlord issues to win cheap interactions. The exposure of seeing my name in the group and interacting with a few of them was the actual goal. People are much more easily influenced by familiar faces than complete strangers, unless they are paying them (e.g. consultants). Tragically, no one paid me to go on this campaign. </p>



<figure><img title="GreaseDownDrain » This is a lot" decoding="async" width="707" height="234" src="https://www.thisisalot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GreaseDownDrain.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.thisisalot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GreaseDownDrain.png 707w, https://www.thisisalot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GreaseDownDrain-300x99.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 707px) 100vw, 707px"><figcaption>literally every landlord probably has</figcaption></figure>



<p>A week or two of a few questions sprinkled-in is really all that’s needed. Maybe a total of two questions per group. Bonus points in the questions are about common sources of frustration/anger for landlords. People interact more with content that angers them, and our goal is just to get some interactions. </p>



<h2>Creating friendly-informative content to establish credibility and gain favor of the landlords</h2>



<p>The next phase was a campaign of friendly, helpful, and more importantly strictly factual posts to establish credibility. I spent some time reading the comments of other posts in the group, so I could tailor each post to whatever common misconceptions were being repeated. The more people who could learn something new from my posts, the better. </p>



<figure><img title="LLCs » This is a lot" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="697" height="340" src="https://www.thisisalot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/LLCs.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.thisisalot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/LLCs.png 697w, https://www.thisisalot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/LLCs-300x146.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 697px) 100vw, 697px"></figure>



<p>Notice, there’s not much room to comment from the content of the post. That’s by design. I’m not trying to start a discussion or an argument here. I want people to read the post, smash the like button, and feel a little more informed. Notice the increase in reactions from our beginning questions. The goal is to slowly but steadily build-up reactions and discussions. Don’t come in with too much controversy. </p>



<h2>Cashing in the social currency</h2>



<p>Then it was time to take the offensive. After reading many posts of landlords asking if they can <em>pre-file</em> eviction paperwork (they can’t) to general posts complaining about tenants <em>cooking in their own apartment</em>, I was ready. </p>



<figure><img title="landlords » This is a lot" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="702" height="703" src="https://www.thisisalot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/landlords.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.thisisalot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/landlords.png 702w, https://www.thisisalot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/landlords-300x300.png 300w, https://www.thisisalot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/landlords-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px"><figcaption>they paid the $1000</figcaption></figure>



<p>I had to resist my urge to respond with “<strong>I THINK THE FUCK NOT</strong>“. Instead, I calmly laid out an alternative in which this landlord looks like the hero, instead of someone who seriously just asked if they can <em>pre-file</em> an eviction. Ridiculous. However, the appeal to ego worked. Somewhere, some tenant got a $1,000 check. <strong>Mission accomplished</strong>.</p>

I created this website on April Fool’s Day 2024, after noticing the sharp uptick in garbage writing on the internet. My day job is as a data something. I also do consulting work for small-business’ trying to modernize their data situations and make a buck off them. I write a lot about technology, economics, my own antics, and opinions.&nbsp;

If my writing has entertained, informed, aggravated, or made you reconsider anything, then I consider this blog a fantastic success.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p><span>I</span>n 2022, researchers at the Bee Sensory and Behavioral Ecology Lab at Queen Mary University of London observed bumblebees doing something remarkable: The diminutive, fuzzy creatures were engaging in activity that&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2022.08.013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could only be described as play</a>. Given small wooden balls, the bees pushed them around and rotated them. The behavior had no obvious connection to mating or survival, nor was it rewarded by the scientists. It was, apparently, just for fun.</p><p>The study on playful bees is part of a body of research that a group of prominent scholars of animal minds cited last month, buttressing&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nydeclaration.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new declaration</a>&nbsp;that extends scientific support for consciousness to a wider suite of animals than has been formally acknowledged before. For decades, there’s been a broad agreement among scientists that animals similar to us—the great apes, for example—have conscious experience, even if their consciousness differs from our own. In recent years, however, researchers have begun to acknowledge that consciousness may also be widespread among animals that are very different from us, including invertebrates with completely different and far simpler nervous systems.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have much more in common with other animals than we do with things like ChatGPT.</p>
</blockquote><p>The new declaration, signed by biologists and philosophers, formally embraces that view. It reads, in part: “The empirical evidence indicates at least a realistic possibility of conscious experience in all vertebrates (including all reptiles, amphibians, and fishes) and many invertebrates (including, at minimum, cephalopod mollusks, decapod crustaceans, and insects).” Inspired by recent research findings that describe complex cognitive behaviors in these and other animals, the document represents a new consensus and suggests that researchers may have overestimated the degree of neural complexity required for consciousness.</p>
<p>The four-paragraph New York Declaration on Animal Consciousness was unveiled on April 19, at a one-day conference called “<a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/events/ptbAnN83QHwazPJ6a/the-emerging-science-of-animal-consciousness" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Emerging Science of Animal Consciousness</a>” held at New York University. Spearheaded by the philosopher and cognitive scientist&nbsp;<a href="https://profiles.laps.yorku.ca/profiles/andrewsk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kristin Andrews</a>&nbsp;of York University in Ontario, the philosopher and environmental scientist&nbsp;<a href="https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/jeff-sebo.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeff Sebo</a>&nbsp;of New York University, and the philosopher&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/cpnss/people/jonathan-birch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jonathan Birch</a>&nbsp;of the London School of Economics and Political Science, the declaration has so far been signed by more than 100 researchers, including the psychologists&nbsp;<a href="https://www.psychol.cam.ac.uk/people/nsc22%40cam.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nicola Clayton</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bu.edu/psych/profile/irene-pepperberg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Irene Pepperberg</a>, the neuroscientists&nbsp;<a href="https://www.anilseth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anil Seth</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://alleninstitute.org/person/christof-koch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christof Koch</a>, the zoologist&nbsp;<a href="http://chittkalab.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/Lars.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lars Chittka</a>, and the philosophers&nbsp;<a href="https://consc.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Chalmers</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://petergodfreysmith.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peter Godfrey-Smith</a>.</p><p>The declaration focuses on the most basic kind of consciousness, known as phenomenal consciousness. Roughly put, if a creature has phenomenal consciousness, then it is “like something” to be that creature—an idea enunciated by the philosopher Thomas Nagel in his influential 1974 essay, “<a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~cavitch/pdf-library/Nagel_Bat.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What is it like to be a bat?</a>” Even if a creature is very different from us, Nagel wrote, “fundamentally an organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to&nbsp;<em>be</em>&nbsp;that organism. … We may call this the subjective character of experience.” If a creature is phenomenally conscious, it has the capacity to experience feelings such as pain or pleasure or hunger, but not necessarily more complex mental states such as self-awareness.</p><p>“I hope the declaration [draws] greater attention to the issues of nonhuman consciousness, and to the ethical challenges that accompany the possibility of conscious experiences far beyond the human,” wrote Seth, a neuroscientist at the University of Sussex, in an email. “I hope it sparks discussion, informs policy and practice in animal welfare, and galvanizes an understanding and appreciation that we have much more in common with other animals than we do with things like ChatGPT.”</p><p><strong>A Growing Awareness</strong></p>
<p>The declaration began to take shape last fall, following conversations between Sebo, Andrews, and Birch. “The three of us were talking about how much has happened over the past 10 years, the past 15 years, in the science of animal consciousness,” Sebo recalled. We now know, for example, that&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isci.2021.102229" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">octopuses feel pain</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-62335-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cuttlefish remember details</a>&nbsp;of specific past events.

In conversations and at meetings, experts largely agreed that these animals must have consciousness. However, this newly formed consensus wasn’t being communicated to the wider public, including other scientists and policymakers. So the three researchers decided to draft a clear, concise statement and circulate it among their colleagues for endorsement. The declaration is not meant to be comprehensive but rather “to point to where we think the field is now and where the field is headed,” Sebo said.</p><p>The new declaration updates the most recent effort to establish scientific consensus on animal consciousness. In 2012, researchers published the&nbsp;<a href="http://fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConsciousness.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness</a>, which said that an array of nonhuman animals, including but not limited to mammals and birds, have “the capacity to exhibit intentional behaviors” and that “humans are not unique in possessing the neurological substrates that generate consciousness.”</p>
<p>The new declaration expands the scope of its predecessor and is also worded more carefully, Seth wrote. “It doesn’t try to do science by diktat, but rather emphasizes what we should take seriously regarding animal consciousness and the relevant ethics given the evidence and theories that we have.” He wrote that he is “not in favor of avalanches of open letters and the like,” but that he ultimately “came to the conclusion that this declaration was very much worth supporting.”</p><blockquote>
<p>It’s not enough for people to prevent animals in captivity from experiencing bodily pain and discomfort.</p>
</blockquote><p>Godfrey-Smith, a philosopher of science at the University of Sydney who has worked extensively with octopuses, believes that the complex behaviors those creatures exhibit—including problem-solving, tool use, and play behavior—can only be interpreted as indicators of consciousness. “They’ve got this attentive engagement with things, with us and with novel objects that makes it very hard not to think that there’s quite a lot going on inside them,” he said. He noted that recent papers looking at pain and dreamlike states in octopuses and cuttlefish “point in the same direction … toward experience as being a real part of their lives.”</p><p>While many of the animals mentioned in the declaration have brains and nervous systems that are very different from those of humans, the researchers say that this needn’t be a barrier to consciousness. For example, a bee’s brain contains only about a million neurons, compared to some 86 billion in the case of humans. But each of those bee neurons may be as structurally complex as an oak tree. The network of connections they form is also incredibly dense, with each neuron contacting perhaps 10,000 or 100,000 others. The nervous system of an octopus, by contrast, is complex in other ways. Its organization is highly distributed rather than centralized; a severed arm can exhibit many of the behaviors of the intact animal.</p>

She noted, for example, that even a cerebral cortex—the outer layer of the mammalian brain, which is believed to play a role in attention, perception, memory, and other key aspects of consciousness—may not be necessary for the simpler phenomenal consciousness targeted in the declaration.</p><p>“There was a big debate about whether fish are conscious, and a lot of that had to do with them lacking the brain structures that we see in mammals,” she said. “But when you look at birds and reptiles and amphibians, they have very different brain structures and different evolutionary pressures—and yet some of those brain structures, we’re finding, are doing the same kind of work that a cerebral cortex does in humans.”</p><p>Godfrey-Smith agreed, noting that behaviors indicative of consciousness “can exist in an architecture that looks completely alien to vertebrate or human architecture.”</p>
<p><strong>Mindful Relations</strong></p><p>While the declaration has implications for the treatment of animals, and especially for the prevention of animal suffering, Sebo noted that the focus should go beyond pain. It’s not enough for people to prevent animals in captivity from experiencing bodily pain and discomfort, he said. “We also have to provide them with the kinds of enrichment and opportunities that allow them to express their instincts and explore their environments and engage in social systems and otherwise be the kinds of complex agents they are.”</p><p>But the consequences of bestowing the label of “conscious” onto a wider array of animals—particularly animals whose interests we are not used to considering—are not straightforward. For example, our relationship with insects may be “inevitably a somewhat antagonistic one,” Godfrey-Smith said. Some pests eat crops, and mosquitoes can carry diseases. “The idea that we could just sort of make peace with the mosquitoes—it’s a very different thought than the idea that we could make peace with fish and octopuses,” he said.</p><p>Similarly, little attention is given to the well-being of insects such as<em>&nbsp;Drosophila</em>, which are widely used in biology research. “We think about the welfare of livestock and of mice in research, but we never think about the welfare of the insects,” said&nbsp;<a href="https://hosting.med.upenn.edu/hearing/team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matilda Gibbons</a>, who researches the neural basis of consciousness at the University of Pennsylvania and has signed the declaration.</p>
<p>While scientific bodies have created some standards for the treatment of lab mice, it’s not clear if today’s declaration will lead to new standards for the treatment of insects. But new scientific findings do sometimes spark new policies. Britain, for example,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/News/Latest-news-from-LSE/2021/k-November-21/Octopuses-crabs-and-lobsters-welfare-protection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enacted legislation</a>&nbsp;to increase protection for octopuses, crabs, and lobsters after a London School of Economics&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/business/consulting/reports/review-of-the-evidence-of-sentiences-in-cephalopod-molluscs-and-decapod-crustaceans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>&nbsp;indicated that those animals can experience pain, distress, or harm.</p><p>While the declaration makes no mention of artificial intelligence, the issue of possible AI consciousness has been on the minds of animal-consciousness researchers. “Current AI systems are very unlikely to be conscious,” Sebo said. However, what he’s learned about animal minds “does give me pause and makes me want to approach the topic with caution and humility.”</p><p>Andrews hopes that the declaration will spark more research into animals that have often been overlooked, a move that has the potential to further expand our awareness of the scope of consciousness in the animal world. “All these nematode worms and fruit flies that are in almost every university—study consciousness in them,” she said. “You already have them. Somebody in your lab is going to need a project. Make that project a consciousness project. Imagine that!”</p><p><em>This article was&nbsp;<a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/insects-and-other-animals-have-consciousness-experts-declare-20240419/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally published</a>&nbsp;on the</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/abstractions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quanta Abstractions</a><em>&nbsp;blog.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><span>T</span>hey say, never meet your heroes. Daniel Dennett, who was exceptional in so many ways, and who died last month, was for me an exception to this rule, too.</p><p>Like so many, I was first inspired by Dennett on reading one of his many bestsellers: <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/daniel-c-dennett/consciousness-explained/9780316439480/?lens=little-brown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Consciousness Explained</em></a>. It was 1991 and I was a fresh undergraduate with a powerful but undirected interest in consciousness. I had no idea how to go about studying it, or how to think about it. I was studying physics at Cambridge and had just plowed my way through Roger Penrose’s <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-emperors-new-mind-9780198784920?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Emperor’s New Mind</em></a>, which had left me confused and despondent. Dennett’s book, with its presumptuous but oh-so-appealing title, was both a tease and a salve. I devoured it.</p>

<p>I didn’t agree with, or follow, everything. But I learned so much from his clear, witty writing, and from his famous “<a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://wwnorton.com/books/Intuition-Pumps-And-Other-Tools-for-Thinking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intuition pump</a>” thought experiments. I was left with the strong impression that consciousness, if not explained, was explainable, and I now had a north star to steer by.</p><blockquote>
<p>Learning from him could sometimes feel like looking straight at the sun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Years passed. I thought I might meet him when he examined the doctoral thesis of a friend of mine who was studying with me at the University of Sussex, but it turned out they met over Skype. I would hear stories about him from one of my mentors at the University of Sussex and one of Dennett’s great friends, the philosopher Maggie Boden. These were tales of philosophical bust-ups, of sailing adventures, and of a voracious and seemingly unbounded intellectual appetite. The impression was of someone larger-than-life, who delighted in engaging with the world rather than preaching from an ivory tower. I read every book he wrote, and many of his papers. But the man himself remained remote.</p><p>I finally met Dennett in 2016. I’d recently joined a group of researchers at the <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://cifar.ca/research-programs/brain-mind-consciousness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brain, Mind, and Consciousness Program</a> of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, where Dennett had served as a long-time advisor. I remember feeling nervous when approaching him in the hotel bar before one of our meetings to say hello for the first time, but I needn’t have worried. Dennett was as approachable and avuncular in person as he was esteemed and revered in academia. Which is <em>very</em>. I don’t remember what we talked about then, but in the conversations and email exchanges that followed over the years he unfailingly exuded kindness, intellectual generosity, and perspicuity. He would tell you exactly what he thought, and he had the ability to do so in a way that made you feel improved, rather than dumb for making some stupid mistake.</p><p>Two examples stand out. The first is from seven years ago. I was in Vancouver, about to give a <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/anil_seth_your_brain_hallucinates_your_conscious_reality?language=en" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">TED talk</a>, and I was terrified. There were hundreds of influential people watching in person, and thousands more online. The next 16 minutes could be transformational or a total flop. But of all the people there whose opinions might matter, the one person I really didn’t want to disappoint was Dan Dennett.</p><p>Afterward, amid the high-fiving and catharsis, I noticed a short tweet from Dennett.</p>
<figure><img width="800" height="231" alt="In Body Image" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/TgDmwTgL-Seth_BREAKER.png?auto=compress&amp;fit=scale&amp;fm=png&amp;h=296&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1&amp;w=1024&amp;wpsize=large" srcset="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/TgDmwTgL-Seth_BREAKER.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1600 800w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/TgDmwTgL-Seth_BREAKER.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1200 600w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/TgDmwTgL-Seth_BREAKER.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=800 400w" loading="lazy"></figure><p>“Almost perfect but not quite.” This combination of generosity and gentle criticism was typical. And he was right. In my talk I’d made the mistake of using the phrase “inner movie” to describe the multisensory immersive nature of conscious experience. But an inner movie implies an inner movie-watcher, a Cartesian homunculus of exactly the sort that Dennett—and I—wanted to expunge. This wasn’t a technicality. It was a give-away that I hadn’t really internalized the insight.</p><p>The second example was from a pandemic year. I was finalizing the first draft of my book <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/566315/being-you-by-anil-seth/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Being You</em></a> and, with some hesitation, I’d asked Dan if he’d be willing to consider writing a blurb for the cover. He declined, disarmingly—explaining that he’d decided some time back not to do any more blurbs, and if he changed his mind for me he’d risk upsetting many of his colleagues and friends he’d already said no to. But to my amazement he offered something much more valuable. He said he would set the draft as the reading for his next course at Tufts University, and then we could have two or three long Zoom sessions going through each chapter in detail with him and his class of talented students. It still astounds me that he took the time to do this, but he did, and the discussions we had in these sessions improved the book no end.</p><figure><img width="800" height="569" alt="In Body Image" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Seth_BREAKER-2.png?auto=compress&amp;fm=png&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1" srcset="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Seth_BREAKER-2.png?auto=compress&amp;fm=png&amp;ixlib=php-3.3.1 800w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Seth_BREAKER-2.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1200 600w,https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/Seth_BREAKER-2.png?q=65&amp;auto=format&amp;w=800 400w" loading="lazy"><figcaption><strong>THE GENTLE GIANT: </strong>Anil Seth with his personal hero Daniel Dennett.

<p>I never stopped learning from Dennett. I found myself coming round to his way of thinking on many things: <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Darwins-Dangerous-Idea/Daniel-C-Dennett/9780684824710" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the centrality of evolution</a> for understanding the mind, <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262540421/elbow-room/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to think about free will</a> (though in 2021 we found ourselves on opposite sides of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA4tGpJPc8Q" target="_blank" aria-label="a debate (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">a debate</a> on the topic), and of course the absence of—or any need for—an inner observer, homunculus, or theater in the brain where everything “comes together.” But learning from him could sometimes feel like looking straight at the sun. I had to look away, to approach things sidelong, sparking the worry that I’d never fully grasp the weight of his arguments.</p><p>Dennett was often described as a philosophical “<a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://keithfrankish.github.io/articles/Frankish_Illusionism%20as%20a%20theory%20of%20consciousness_eprint.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">illusionist</a>,” a position sometimes caricatured as saying that consciousness doesn’t exist. (A criticism of his 1991 book was that it should’ve been called <em>Consciousness Explained Away</em>.) But illusionism doesn’t, in fact, say this. On one reading, it says we are mistaken to think that the relationship between consciousness and physical, biological processes in the brain is a big mystery—the mystery that fellow philosopher David Chalmers calls the “<a href="https://nautil.us/whats-so-hard-about-understanding-consciousness-238421/" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">hard problem</a>” of consciousness. On another reading, which I’m more sympathetic to, it says that consciousness exists, but it might not be what we think it is—in the same way that the color red exists, but is not what we might think it is—there is no redness out there in the world nor is there a red “figment” in the mind, to borrow another of Dennett’s delightful terms.</p><p>I always looked forward to discussing these ideas with Dennett, and to chatting about them with my colleagues and friends, all of us trying to figure out what Dennett might really be thinking. One dimension of the sense of loss I now feel is that these discussions will become historical, a matter of interpretation and exegesis, rather than the living, vital process they so recently were.</p><p>In his later years, Dennett was fond of riffing on Chalmers’ hard problem with what he called the “hard question”: Once some (mental) content reaches consciousness, “then what happens?” This was his way of sending up the many theories that propose that conscious experience might somehow arise out of, or emerge from, this-or-that aspect of brain activity. Neurons fire in synchrony? Or with a certain form of complexity? <em>And then what happens? </em>In his diagnosis, the struggles of consciousness science lay in the systematic failure to properly ask, and answer, this question.</p>
<p>Daniel Clement Dennett was a gentle giant of the intellectual world. I, along with many others, will miss him deeply. He leaves an unmatched legacy in his books and papers, in how he brought philosophy and science together, and in the legions of students and researchers he taught and inspired. He was, I will assume, a materialist to the end. And in dying, perhaps Dan put his materialist beliefs to the ultimate test. And then what happens? <img decoding="async" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/nautilus-favicon-14.png?fm=png" alt=""></p><p><em>Lead image: Master1305 / Shutterstock</em></p> <ul>

<p>It's been a bad couple of years for Microsoft's security and privacy efforts. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/10/microsoft-under-fire-for-response-to-leak-of-2-4tb-of-sensitive-customer-data/">Misconfigured endpoints</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/08/a-renegade-certificate-is-removed-from-windows-then-it-returns-confusion-ensues/">rogue security certificates</a>, and weak passwords have all caused or risked the exposure of sensitive data, and Microsoft has been criticized by security researchers, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/07/us-senator-blasts-microsoft-for-negligent-cybersecurity-practices/">US lawmakers</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/08/microsoft-cloud-security-blasted-for-its-culture-of-toxic-obfuscation/">regulatory agencies</a> for how it has responded to and disclosed these threats.</p>

<p>The most high-profile of these breaches involved a China-based hacking group named Storm-0558, which breached Microsoft's Azure service and collected data for over a month in mid-2023 before being discovered and driven out. After <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/07/microsoft-takes-pains-to-obscure-role-in-0-days-that-caused-email-breach/">months of ambiguity</a>, Microsoft disclosed that a series of security failures gave Storm-0558 access to an engineer's account, which allowed Storm-0558 to collect data from 25 of Microsoft's Azure customers, including US federal agencies.</p>
<p>In January, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/01/microsoft-network-breached-through-password-spraying-by-russian-state-hackers/">Microsoft disclosed that it had been breached again</a>, this time by Russian state-sponsored hacking group Midnight Blizzard. The group was able "to compromise a legacy non-production test tenant account" to gain access to Microsoft's systems for "as long as two months."</p>
<p>All of this culminated in a report (<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-04/CSRB_Review_of_the_Summer_2023_MEO_Intrusion_Final_508c.pdf">PDF</a>) from the US Cyber Safety Review Board, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/microsoft-blamed-for-a-cascade-of-security-failures-in-exchange-breach-report/">castigated</a> Microsoft for its "inadequate" security culture, its "inaccurate public statements," and its response to "preventable" security breaches.</p>
<p>To attempt to turn things around, Microsoft announced something it called the "<a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/11/02/secure-future-initiative-sfi-cybersecurity-cyberattacks/">Secure Future Initiative</a>" in November 2023. As part of that initiative, Microsoft today <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/05/03/security-above-all-else-expanding-microsofts-secure-future-initiative/">announced</a> a series of plans and changes to its security practices, including a few changes that have already been made.</p>
<p>"We are making security our top priority at Microsoft, above all else—over all other features," wrote Microsoft Security Executive Vice President Charlie Bell. "We’re expanding the scope of SFI, integrating the recent recommendations from the CSRB as well as our learnings from Midnight Blizzard to ensure that our cybersecurity approach remains robust and adaptive to the evolving threat landscape."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>As part of these changes, Microsoft will also make its Senior Leadership Team's pay partially dependent on whether the company is "meeting our security plans and milestones," though Bell didn't specify how much executive pay would be dependent on meeting those security goals.</p>
<p>Microsoft's post describes three security principles ("secure by design," "secure by default," and "secure operations") and six "security pillars" meant to address different weaknesses in Microsoft's systems and development practices. The company says it plans to secure 100 percent of all its user accounts with "securely managed, phishing-resistant multifactor authentication," enforce least-privilege access across all applications and user accounts, improve network monitoring and isolation, and retain all system security logs for at least two years, among other promises. Microsoft is also planning to put new deputy Chief Information Security Officers on different engineering teams to track their progress and report back to the executive team and board of directors.</p>
<p>As for concrete fixes that Microsoft has already implemented, Bell writes that Microsoft has "implemented automatic enforcement of multifactor authentication by default across more than 1 million Microsoft Entra ID tenants within Microsoft," removed 730,000 old and/or insecure apps "to date across production and corporate tenants," expanded its security logging, and adopted the <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2024/04/toward-greater-transparency-adopting-the-cwe-standard-for-microsoft-cves/">Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) standard</a> for its security disclosures.</p>
<p>In addition to Bell's public security promises, The Verge has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24148033/satya-nadella-microsoft-security-memo">obtained and published an internal memo</a> from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella that re-emphasizes the company's publicly stated commitment to security. Nadella also says that improving security should be prioritized over adding new features, something that may affect the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/microsoft-commits-to-updating-windows-11-once-per-year-and-also-all-the-time/">constant stream of tweaks and changes</a> that Microsoft releases for Windows 11 and other software.</p>
<p>"The recent findings by the Department of Homeland Security’s Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB) regarding the Storm-0558 cyberattack, from summer 2023, underscore the severity of the threats facing our company and our customers, as well as our responsibility to defend against these increasingly sophisticated threat actors," writes Nadella. "If you’re faced with the tradeoff between security and another priority, your answer is clear: <strong>Do security</strong>. In some cases, this will mean prioritizing security above other things we do, such as releasing new features or providing ongoing support for legacy systems."</p>

							<p>In the late 1970s, a team of karate-loving physicists decided to perform an experiment inspired by their collective passion for martial arts. The group was made up of physicist Michael Feld, a brown belt who liked to illustrate the physics of karate via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REcj-zaG4Lc">live demonstrations to his classes at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>; Ronald McNair, <a href="https://greensboro.com/news/local_news/30-things-you-should-know-about-astronaut-ronald-mcnair/article_35a46ea7-b52b-5be5-91ec-6d02a023dfe4.html">future astronaut and fifth-degree black belt</a>; and undergraduate Stephen Wilk.</p><p><a href="https://bit.ly/30jM88p"><img decoding="async" src="https://daily.jstor.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/jstor_daily_patreon_membership_hat_800.jpg" alt="JSTOR Daily Membership Ad" width="800" height="196"><img src="https://daily.jstor.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/jstor_daily_patreon_membership_hat_mobile_800.jpg" alt="JSTOR Daily Membership Ad"></a></p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24965179?mag=the-physics-of-karate">The picture of a karate expert breaking stout slabs of wood and concrete with his bare hand is a familiar one</a>,” begins a 1979 paper by Feld, McNair, and Wilk. The trio wanted to know: How can a bare hand demolish a solid block of wood or concrete without injury? What’s the trick?</p>
		
		
<p>As it turns out, there’s no trick—the perfect karate strike is nothing more than a precise application of Newton’s laws.</p>
<p>Feld, McNair, and Wilk placed wood and concrete in a hydraulic press to determine the amount of stress (force) needed to crack the underside of the objects. A wood plank can bend by about one centimeter before it breaks, which requires a force of 500 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_(unit)">newtons</a>. Concrete blocks only need to be deflected one millimeter before breaking, but since the material is less bendable than wood, that displacement requires 2,500 to 3,000 newtons. And because some energy is lost upon collision, the fist needs to exert <i>even more</i> force than that in order to actually break the blocks.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the human hand is capable of generating a very high degree of force in a very short period of time. The impact from a typical strike lasts only about five milliseconds. Through a combination of theory and experiment, the team discovered that within this brief flash of time, “the hand of the karateka, or practitioner of karate, can…exert a force of more than 3,000 newtons, a wallop of 675 pounds.” The team’s model indicates that the hand must reach a speed of 6.1 meters per second to break wood and 10.6 meters per second to break concrete. “Such speeds agree with our observation that beginners can break wood but not concrete,” they write. “A hand velocity of 6.1 meters per second is within range of the beginner, but a velocity of 10.6 meters per second calls for training and practice.”</p>

<p>Feld and McNair were able to show off their martial arts skills during the investigation. Both were photographed striking a pile of wood planks at 120 frames per second. This allowed them to measure the displacement, velocity, and acceleration of different parts of the fist. These photos showed that the fist compresses and distorts “to such an extent that it scarcely behaves like a solid object.”</p>
<p>The obvious follow-up question: “How is it that the hand of the karateka is not shattered by the force of the karate strike?” Here, it’s anatomy to the rescue: Human bone is five times stiffer than concrete and fifty times harder to break (successfully karate-chopping a femur would take more than 25,000 newtons’ worth of force). The bones in the hand are easily able to absorb the stress of the impact. Of course, it’s technique, not strength, that provides the real power. A successful strike needs to hit the board precisely in the center. With enough training, karate represents the human body at its maximum, the group writes, and “The precision demanded…makes karate not only an excellent physical discipline but also a mental one.”</p>
