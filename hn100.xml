<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

        

        <p>The day before 2023 on of my favorite artists decided to drop a new track (link)! Amazing, I thought, I’ll add it to my Spotify playlist.</p>
        <img src="https://vincentsg.dev/images/article/dec31/Spotify.png" alt="me searching for the song on spotify">

    	<p>Unfortunately it was no where to be found, and this wasn’t the only song. Easy! I can just download the mp3 off YouTube and add it to my Spotify playlist manually. Let me just find a website.</p>
        <img src="https://vincentsg.dev/images/article/dec31/ytmp3.png" alt="mp3 downloader website">

        <p>Admittedly the website was pretty nice with only a single strange ad, however it still left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth. Downloading random files off websites like these probably isn’t the most hygienic computing practice. After all I’ve been a full stack dev for a little bit (just graduated college!) This should be no problem let’s just see what YouTube does…</p>
        <img src="https://vincentsg.dev/images/article/dec31/youtubeNetwork.png" alt="youtube network traffic">
        <p>Oh... that's ALOT of parameters</p>
        <p>wondering if anyone else had already reversed it, which led me to a hackernews post and then to this site <a href="https://tyrrrz.me/blog/reverse-engineering-youtube-revisited">https://tyrrrz.me/blog/reverse-engineering-youtube-revisited</a></p>
        <p>After reading throught the entire AMAZING post I created a fetch request in node using the android example only to get back a 403 error...Not readable. No biggie I'll switch to the embedded web player it seems much more useful anyway! I carefully extracted the decoder from the youtube player just as the blog said and prepared the request</p>

        <img src="https://vincentsg.dev/images/article/dec31/embeddedAttempt.png" alt="my fetch request to youtube using an embeded context">
        <p>I sent it off and BOOM! ....wait what? a 403?? I double cheked my code and the decryption but didn't find any faults. At this point I was pretty bummed but remembered about an open source project called invidious that Lous Rossman mentioend. I nagivated to the website and noticed that they were pulling the videos directly from youtube's rr endpoint. Exactly what I wanted to do! How is this possible? On a closer inspection of the netowrk traffic I saw the keywork ANDROID. The original method I was using, but how did they get theirs to work?</p>

        
        <p>Since the project is open source I parsed their github only to find it was in a language called crystal. Despite me being unfamilliar it was easy enough to read and reminded me of bash. Eventually I stumbeled on two functions</p>

        <img src="https://vincentsg.dev/images/article/dec31/invidiousPlayer.png" alt="invidious player source code">
        <p>This was the function I needed! Looking at the request it seems that they had additional context compared to what I had especially the html5 context. I found where the function was called and determined that they initally used and ANDROID client for the first attempt, matching what I initally saw in their network traffic. With all of this I put together my own network call and.... BOOM!!! FINALLY A STREAM. Since this wasn't using the web client I didn't need to decode the signature it was free to access.</p>

        <p>
     
            let data = { <br>
                "videoId": videoId,<br>
                "context": {<br>

                    },<br>
                },<br>
            }<br>

        </p>

        
        <p>I quickly threw together an ugly frontend and posted it to digital ocean under an express server and prepped another project to repair my broken discord bot.</p>
        <a href="https://www.yt-linkify.com/">https://www.yt-linkify.com</a>
        <p>Hopefully this is usefull to someone or just an interesting read. Big shoutout to the invidious project and tyrrrz's blog they did basically all of the heavy lifting for this new developer! </p>
        <p>If this ever makes it to Hacker News, I love you guys! I read the site multiple times a day. You all keep me motivated especially in times like this where I'm not sure if I should continue being a developer. Thanks for keeping me sane and happy new year!</p> 
        <p>If anyone is hiring check out the other links on the site to get in contact with me Cheers! </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>I have served as a voting member of the Harvard College Honor Council, the body tasked with upholding the College’s community standards of academic integrity.</span></p><p><span>In my time on the Council, I heard dozens of cases. When students — my classmates, peers, and friends — appear before the council, they are distraught. For most, it is the worst day of their college careers. For some, it is the worst day of their lives. They often cry.</span></p><p><span>It is because I have seen first-hand how heart-wrenching these decisions can be, and still think them necessary, that I call on University President Claudine Gay to resign for her numerous and serious violations of academic ethics.</span></p><p><span>Let’s compare the treatment of Harvard undergraduates suspected of plagiarism with that of their president.</span></p><p><span>A plurality of the Honor Council’s investigations concern plagiarism. In the 2021-22 school year, the last year for which data is publicly available, <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/5/22/harvard-honor-council-2021-2022/">43 percent of cases involved plagiarism</a> or misuse of sources.</span></p><p><span>Omitting quotation marks, citing sources incompletely, or not citing sources at all constitutes plagiarism according to Harvard’s definitions.</span></p><p><span>In my experience, when students omit quotation marks and citations, as President Gay did, the sanction is usually one term of probation — a permanent mark on a student’s record. A student on probation is no longer considered in good standing, disqualifying them from opportunities like fellowships and study-abroad programs. Good standing is also required to receive a degree.</span></p><p><span>What is striking about the allegations of plagiarism against President Gay is that the improprieties are routine and pervasive.</span></p><p><span>She is accused of plagiarism in her dissertation and at least two of her 11 journal articles. Two sentences from the acknowledgement section of her dissertation even seem to have been copied from another work.</span></p><p><span>According to the Honor Council’s procedures, the response to a violation depends on the “seriousness of the infraction” and “extenuating circumstances, including the extent to which a student has had similar trouble before.” In other words, while a single lifted paragraph could be blamed on a lapse in judgment, a pattern is more concerning.</span></p><p><span>In my experience, when a student is found responsible for multiple separate Honor Code violations, they are generally required to withdraw — i.e., suspended — from the College for two semesters. Since the Council was established in 2015, roughly 16 percent of students who have appeared before us have been required to withdraw.</span></p><p><span>It is a serious thing for the Council to render this judgment, and I have never taken any such vote lightly. Voting to suspend a peer with whom I might share a dorm, club, or class is not easy. We have even voted to suspend seniors just about to graduate.</span></p><p><span>But strict sanctions are necessary to demonstrate that our community values academic integrity. Cheating on exams is not okay. Plagiarism is not okay.</span></p><p><span>It may be true that the plagiarism allegations against President Gay fall short of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ interim policy on research misconduct. She may not have “intentionally, knowingly, and recklessly” tried to represent the work of her doctoral advisor and others as her own. And there is no evidence that any of her arguments posited as original contributions were plagiarized.</span></p><p><span>But President Gay’s pattern of mistakes is serious, and the Harvard Corporation should not minimize these allegations of plagiarism, <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/12/12/gay-stays-in-office-corporation-support/">as it has readily done</a>.</span></p><p><span>In a Dec. 12 University-wide letter, the Corporation described the alleged plagiarism as “a few instances of inadequate citation.” The letter lauded President Gay for “proactively” correcting her articles by inserting citations and quotation marks.</span></p><p><span>By definition, Gay’s corrections were not proactive but reactive — she only made them after she was caught. And that the Corporation considers her corrections an adequate response is not fair to undergraduates, who cannot simply submit corrections to avoid penalties.</span></p><p><span>When my peers are found responsible for multiple instances of inadequate citation, they are often suspended for an academic year. When the president of their university is found responsible for the same types of infractions, the fellows of the Corporation “unanimously stand in support of” her.</span></p><p><span>There is one standard for me and my peers and another, much lower standard for our University’s president. The Corporation should resolve the double standard by demanding her resignation.</span></p><p><span><em><strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> In order to protect the author from retaliation, and because the proceedings of the Harvard College Honor Council are sensitive and confidential, we made the decision to grant this author anonymity.</em></span></p><p><span><em>Readers should also note that online commenting has been disabled for this piece in an effort to help protect the author’s identity.</em></span></p><p><span><em>—Tommy Barone and Jacob M.

I have rails guides bookmarked for this purpose - 5 minutes waiting for an uber gains me some useful knowledge while alleviating boredom.</p><p>- Search wide, be selective. A few good reads is better than a lot of average/bad ones. Be prepared to skip chapters if it isn't delivering value after 2-3 chapters, and quit entirely if you can't find worthy content after reading a few chapters + table of contents and skimming a few more chapters. Give it a little longer if you're unfamiliar with the topic or style.</p><p>- A lot of 200+ page books could have instead been 10 page essays. Quickly move over unimportant sections if you get the impression they're filler. Same (or, more so) for other mediums too.

<p>31st December 2023</p>

<p>2023 was the breakthrough year for Large Language Models (LLMs). I think it’s OK to call these AI—they’re the latest and (currently) most interesting development in the academic field of Artificial Intelligence that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop">dates back to the 1950s</a>.</p>

<h4 id="large-language-models">Large Language Models</h4>
<p>In the past 24-36 months, our species has discovered that you can take a GIANT corpus of text, run it through a pile of GPUs, and use it to create a fascinating new kind of software.</p>
<p>LLMs can do a lot of things. They can answer questions, summarize documents, translate from one language to another, extract information and even write surprisingly competent code.</p>
<p>They can also help you cheat at your homework, generate unlimited streams of fake content and be used for all manner of nefarious purposes.</p>
<p>So far, I think they’re a net positive. I’ve used them on a personal level to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/27/ai-enhanced-development/">improve my productivity</a> (and entertain myself) in all sorts of different ways. I think people who learn how to use them effectively can gain a significant boost to their quality of life.</p>
<p>A lot of people are yet to be sold on their value! Some think their negatives outweigh their positives, some think they are all hot air, and some even think they represent an existential threat to humanity.</p>
<h4 id="easy-to-build">They’re actually quite easy to build</h4>
<p>The most surprising thing we’ve learned about LLMs this year is that they’re actually quite easy to build.</p>
<p>Intuitively, one would expect that systems this powerful would take millions of lines of complex code. Instead, it turns out a <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT/blob/master/train.py">few hundred lines of Python</a> is genuinely enough to train a basic version!</p>
<p>What matters most is the training  data. You need a <em>lot</em> of data to make these things work, and the quantity and quality of the training data appears to be the most important factor in how good the resulting model is.</p>
<p>If you can gather the right data, and afford to pay for the GPUs to train it, you can build a LLM.</p>
<p>A year ago, the only organization that had released a generally useful LLM was OpenAI. We’ve now seen better-than-GPT-3 class models produced by Anthropic, Mistral, Google, Meta, EleutherAI, Stability AI, TII in Abu Dhabi (<a href="https://falconllm.tii.ae/">Falcon</a>), Microsoft Research, xAI, Replit, Baidu and a bunch of other organizations.</p>
<p>The training cost (hardware and electricity) is still significant—initially millions of dollars, but that seems to have dropped to the tens of thousands already. Microsoft’s Phi-2 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/phi-2-the-surprising-power-of-small-language-models/">claims to have used</a> “14 days on 96 A100 GPUs”, which works out at around $35,000 <a href="https://lambdalabs.com/service/gpu-cloud">using current Lambda pricing</a>.</p>
<p>So training an LLM still isn’t something a hobbyist can afford, but it’s no longer the sole domain of the super-rich. I like to compare the difficulty of training an LLM to that of building a suspension bridge—not trivial, but hundreds of countries around the world have figured out how to do it.</p>
<h4 id="on-your-devices">You can run LLMs on your own devices</h4>
<p>In January of this year, I thought it would be years before I could run a useful LLM on my own computer. GPT-3 and 3.5 were pretty much the only games in town, and I thought that even if the model weights were available it would take a $10,000+ server to run them.</p>
<p>Then in February, Meta released Llama. And a few weeks later in March, Georgi Gerganov released code that got it working on a MacBook.</p>
<p>I wrote about how <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/11/llama/">Large language models are having their Stable Diffusion moment</a>, and with hindsight that was a very good call!</p>
<p>This unleashed a whirlwind of innovation, which was accelerated further in July when Meta <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jul/18/accessing-llama-2/">released Llama 2</a>—an improved version which, crucially, included permission for commercial use.</p>
<p>Today there are literally thousands of LLMs that can be run locally, on all manner of different devices.</p>
<p>I run a bunch of them on my laptop. I run Mistral 7B (a surprisingly great model) <a href="https://llm.mlc.ai/#ios">on my iPhone</a>. You can install several different apps to get your own, local, completely private LLM.</p>
<p>You can even <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/16/web-llm/">run them entirely in your browser</a> using WebAssembly and the latest Chrome!</p>
<h4 id="hobbyist-fine-tuning">Hobbyists can build their own fine-tuned models</h4>
<p>I said earlier that building an LLM was still out of reach of hobbyists. That may be true for training from scratch, but fine-tuning one of those models is another matter entirely.</p>
<p>There’s now a fascinating ecosystem of people training their own models on top of these foundations, publishing those models, building fine-tuning datasets and sharing those too.</p>
<p>The Hugging Face <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard">Open LLM Leaderboard</a> is one place that tracks these. I can’t even attempt to count them, and any count would be out-of-date within a few hours.</p>
<p>The best overall openly licensed LLM at any time is rarely a foundation model: instead, it’s whichever fine-tuned community model has most recently discovered the best combination of fine-tuning data.</p>
<p>This is a huge advantage for open over closed models: the closed, hosted models don’t have thousands of researchers and hobbyists around the world collaborating and competing to improve them.</p>
<h4 id="cant-build-gpt4">We don’t yet know how to build GPT-4</h4>
<p>Frustratingly, despite the enormous leaps ahead we’ve had this year, we are yet to see an alternative model that’s better than GPT-4.</p>
<p>OpenAI released GPT-4 in March, though it later turned out we had a sneak peak of it in February when Microsoft used it as part of the new Bing.</p>
<p>This may well change in the next few weeks: Google’s Gemini Ultra has big claims, but isn’t yet available for us to try out.</p>
<p>The team behind Mistral are working to beat GPT-4 as well, and their track record is <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Dec/18/mistral/">already extremely strong</a> considering their first public model only came out in September, and they’ve released two significant improvements since then.</p>
<p>Still, I’m surprised that no-one has beaten the now almost year old GPT-4 by now. OpenAI clearly have some substantial tricks that they haven’t shared yet.</p>
<h4 id="vibes-based-development">Vibes Based Development</h4>
<p>As a computer scientist and software engineer, LLMS are <em>infuriating</em>.</p>
<p>Even the openly licensed ones are still the world’s most convoluted black boxes. We continue to have very little idea what they can do, how exactly they work and how best to control them.</p>
<p>I’m used to programming where the computer does exactly what I tell it to do. Prompting an LLM is decidedly not that!</p>
<p>The worst part is the challenge of evaluating them.</p>
<p>There are plenty of benchmarks, but no benchmark is going to tell you if an LLM actually “feels” right when you try it for a given task.</p>
<p>I find I have to work with an LLM for a few weeks in order to get a good intuition for it’s strengths and weaknesses. This greatly limits how many I can evaluate myself!</p>
<p>The most frustrating thing for me is at the level of individual prompting.</p>
<p>Sometimes I’ll tweak a prompt and capitalize some of the words in it, to emphasize that I <em>really</em> want it to OUTPUT VALID MARKDOWN or similar. Did capitalizing those words make a difference? I still don’t have a good methodology for figuring that out.</p>
<p>We’re left with what’s effectively Vibes Based Development. It’s vibes all the way down.</p>
<p>I’d love to see us move beyond vibes in 2024!</p>
<h4 id="smart-and-dumb">LLMs are really smart, and also really, really dumb</h4>
<p>On the one hand, we keep on finding new things that LLMs can do that we didn’t expect—and that the people who trained the models didn’t expect either. That’s usually really fun!</p>
<p>But on the other hand, the things you sometimes have to do to get the models to behave are often <em>incredibly</em> dumb.</p>
<p>Does ChatGPT <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/is-chatgpt-becoming-lazier-because-its-december-people-run-tests-to-find-out/">get lazy in December</a>, because it’s hidden system prompt includes the current date and its training data shows that people provide less useful answers coming up to the holidays?</p>
<p>The honest answer is “maybe”! No-one is entirely sure, but if you give it a different date its answers may skew slightly longer.</p>
<p>Sometimes it omits sections of code and leaves you to fill them in, but if you tell it you can’t type because you don’t have any fingers it produces the full code for you instead.</p>
<p>There are so many more examples like this. Offer it cash tips for better answers. Tell it your career depends on it. Give it positive reinforcement. It’s all so dumb, but it works!</p>
<h4 id="gullibility-unsolved">Gullibility is the biggest unsolved problem</h4>
<p>I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Sep/12/prompt-injection/">coined the term prompt injection</a> in September last year.</p>
<p>15 months later, I regret to say that we’re still no closer to a robust, dependable solution to this problem.</p>
<p>I’ve written <a href="https://simonwillison.net/series/prompt-injection/">a ton about this already</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond that specific class of security vulnerabilities, I’ve started seeing this as a wider problem of <strong>gullibility</strong>.</p>
<p>Language Models are gullible. They “believe” what we tell them—what’s in their training data, then what’s in the fine-tuning data, then what’s in the prompt.</p>
<p>In order to be useful tools for us, we need them to believe what we feed them!</p>
<p>But it turns out a lot of the things we want to build need them <em>not</em> to be gullible.</p>
<p>Everyone wants an AI personal assistant. If you hired a real-world personal assistant who believed <em>everything</em> that anyone told them, you would quickly find that their ability to positively impact your life was severely limited.</p>
<p>A lot of people are excited about AI agents—an infuriatingly vague term that seems to be converging on “AI systems that can go away and act on your behalf”. We’ve been talking about them all year, but I’ve seen few if any examples of them running in production, despite lots of exciting prototypes.</p>
<p>I think this is because of gullibility.</p>
<p>Can we solve this? Honestly, I’m beginning to suspect that you can’t fully solve gullibility without achieving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">AGI</a>. So it may be quite a while before those agent dreams can really start to come true!</p>
<h4 id="code-best-application">Code may be the best application</h4>
<p>Over the course of the year, it’s become increasingly clear that writing code is one of the things LLMs are <em>most</em> capable of.</p>
<p>If you think about what they do, this isn’t such a big surprise. The grammar rules of programming languages like Python and JavaScript are massively less complicated than the grammar of Chinese, Spanish or English.</p>
<p>It’s still astonishing to me how effective they are though.</p>
<p>One of the great weaknesses of LLMs is their tendency to hallucinate—to imagine things that don’t correspond to reality. You would expect this to be a particularly bad problem for code—if an LLM hallucinates a method that doesn’t exist, the code should be useless.</p>
<p>Except... you can run generated code to see if it’s correct. And with patterns <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/12/code-interpreter/">like ChatGPT Code Interpreter</a> the LLM can execute the code itself, process the error message, then rewrite it and keep trying until it works!</p>
<p>So hallucination is a much lesser problem for code generation than for anything else. If only we had the equivalent of Code Interpreter for fact-checking natural language!</p>
<p>How should we feel about this as software engineers?</p>
<p>On the one hand, this feels like a threat: who needs a programmer if ChatGPT can write code for you?</p>
<p>On the other hand, as software engineers we are better placed to take advantage of this than anyone else. We’ve all been given <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Oct/17/open-questions/#open-questions.036.jpeg">weird coding interns</a>—we can use our deep knowledge to prompt them to solve coding problems more effectively than anyone else can.</p>
<h4 id="ethics-diabolically-complex">The ethics of this space remain diabolically complex</h4>
<p>In September last year Andy Baio and I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Sep/5/laion-aesthetics-weeknotes/">produced the first major story</a> on the unlicensed training data behind Stable Diffusion.</p>
<p>Since then, almost every major LLM (and most of the image generation models) have also been trained on unlicensed data.</p>
<p>Just this week, the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html">launched a landmark lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft</a> over this issue. The <a href="https://nytco-assets.nytimes.com/2023/12/NYT_Complaint_Dec2023.pdf">69 page PDF</a> is genuinely worth reading—especially the first few pages, which lay out the issues in a way that’s surprisingly easy to follow. The rest of the document includes some of the clearest explanations of what LLMs are, how they work and how they are built that I’ve read anywhere.</p>
<p>The legal arguments here are complex. I’m not a lawyer, but I don’t think this one will be easily decided. Whichever way it goes, I expect this case to have a profound impact on how this technology develops in the future.</p>
<p>Law is not ethics. Is it OK to train models on people’s content without their permission, when those models will then be used in ways that compete with those people?</p>
<p>As the quality of results produced by AI models has increased over the year, these questions have become even more pressing.</p>
<p>The impact on human society in terms of these models is already huge, if difficult to objectively measure.</p>
<p>People have certainly lost work to them—anecdotally, I’ve seen this for copywriters, artists and translators.</p>
<p>There are a great deal of untold stories here. I’m hoping 2024 sees significant amounts of dedicated journalism on this topic.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why</h2>
<p dir="auto">Bazzite started as a project to resolve some of the issues that plague SteamOS, mainly out of date packages (despite an Arch base) and the lack of a functional package manager.</p>
<p dir="auto">Despite this project also being image-based, you are able to install any Fedora package straight from the command line. These packages will persist across updates <sub><sup>(So go ahead and install that obscure VPN software you spent an hour trying to get working in SteamOS)</sup></sub>. Additionally, Bazzite is updated multiple times a week with packages from upstream Fedora, giving you the best possible performance and latest features - all on a stable base.</p>
<p dir="auto">Bazzite ships with the latest Linux kernel and SELinux enabled by default with full support for secure boot <sub><sup>(Run <code>ujust enroll-secure-boot-key</code> and enter the password <code>ublue-os</code> if prompted to enroll our key)</sup></sub> and disk encryption, making this a sensible solution for general computing. <sup><sub>(Yes, you can print from Bazzite)</sub></sup></p>

<p>Meta's sudden interest in ActivityPub and Mastodon doesn't make much sense. There are a few impossibly consistent talking points floating through the Fediverse. Each tries to explain away the oddity of Meta's presence.</p>
<p>I don't buy <em>any of it</em>. This is a plan years in the making. And we're watching Meta's biggest hurdle play out in real-time.</p>
<p>What if Meta's hidden objective behind the Threads-to-Mastodon initiative is a play on&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/app.net">app.net</a>? And, what if threads.net is a measured step towards what could be the greatest pivot in all of tech?</p>
<p>Put on your tinfoil hats, kids. Papa's got a story.</p>
<p>Over the past four years, Mark Zuckerberg has made moves that imply he's positioning Meta as a sort of <strong>Platform as a Service</strong> provider for social media companies.</p>
<p>This theory is in good company. Here's a 2019 tweet from "a member of Facebook's inner circle” reported by the Mostly Cloudy Newsletter<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm going to make a prediction: in five years, &gt;25% of Facebook Inc's revenue will comes from selling cloud services to other UGC companies to meet global compliance needs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If successful, Meta would usher in a new social media era as the first lords of the "social web.” The aftermath could mean that Meta gains an unprecedented concentration of power over what we see, who we interact with, and where developers can build digital communities.</p>
<p>Indie developers could gain a much-needed revenue stream through an ad-share program, which would be great if it weren't Meta writing the checks. We saw what happened to small businesses and aggregator websites. We saw what almost happened to corporate media after Facebook launched Instant Articles.</p>
<p>Everyday-users would pay the highest price. We'd be left with little more than the illusion of choice, resembling something approaching Proctor &amp; Gamble's generic competitive strategy. We may gain the <em>technical</em> ability to move platforms with our followers and content in hand, but only so much as non-Meta affiliated social media exist. And perhaps not even then.</p>
<p>Meta must create a new market out of thin air to accomplish this monumental pivot. Such a feat could prove risky without something to compel indie developers and server admins to use Meta's shiny new infrastructure. That something could be regulation. Targeted lobbying has made it difficult for start-ups to compete in social media. Four new bills are floating around Congress. Each bill resembles Mark Zuckerberg's four-point plan.</p>
<p>Zuck's plan, published in the Washington Post, came one year after Cambridge Analytica and three months before the prediction tweet.</p>
<p>It sounds <em>absurd</em> that the biggest social media company would pivot from its golden goose. But when you peek into Meta's egg basket, you see it's empty. My guess is that goose was cooked a long time ago.</p>
<p>I'm not suggesting it happens all at once. It'll take years to fully pivot. And it's not like Meta will give away the billions of users it currently serves. But a decision has been made, and action taken.</p>
<p>Here's what I think happened: Zuck saw the writing on the wall, and he finally had enough— the congressional hearings, EU regulators, the impossible content moderation trap— all of it. It was time to get out of the social media game for good. Meta has the infrastructure skills and political influence to pull it off. He only needed the right angle to dip his toe in the water.</p>
<h3 id="mark-zuckerberg-s-four-point-plan" tabindex="-1">Mark Zuckerberg's Four-Point Plan <a href="#mark-zuckerberg-s-four-point-plan">#</a></h3>
<p>In 2019, Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/mark-zuckerberg-the-internet-needs-new-rules-lets-start-in-these-four-areas/2019/03/29/9e6f0504-521a-11e9-a3f7-78b7525a8d5f_story.html">published an op-ed</a> in the Washington Post calling for more government regulation of social media. He identified four areas needing policy— harmful content, election integrity, privacy, and <strong>data portability</strong>.</p>
<p>From <em>Internet needs new rules. Let's start in these four areas, by Mark Zuckerberg, March 30th, 2019</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, regulation should guarantee the principle of data portability. If you share data with one service, you should be able to move it to another. This gives people choice and enables developers to innovate and compete.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Zuckerberg then announces his support for the <a href="https://dtinit.org/">Data Transfer Project</a>.</p>
<p>The Data Transfer Project, or Data Transfer Initiative (no one can keep the name straight), was founded in 2018. It provides a common framework for internet-based service providers to transfer user data between each other.</p>
<p>The project (or initiative) has some big names attached to it—Google, Microsoft, and then Meta in 2019. Twitter may have dropped out recently, as it's no longer included in press coverage.</p>
<p>All involved with DTP/DTI frame their efforts as a step towards users' controlling their own data. Not so much the <em>type</em> of data big tech may collect on us or what it's allowed to do with it. Just the swapping part. There are a lot of folks jumping from Instagram to Microsoft these days?</p>
<p>On Meta's engineering website, the company <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2019/12/02/security/data-transfer-project/">writes in length</a> about the mission's importance and protocol's ease of use. But the tone for the project shifts within the context of the Fediverse.</p>
<p>A recent conference hosted by DTI (again with the name) announced guests from "the world's biggest ActivityPub projects" and Big Tech™. The <a href="https://dtinit.org/docs/dtp-federated-miniconference-report">event notes reveal</a> that participants were concerned with trust and safety challenges that arise with data transfers on ActivityPub:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a baseline, the ability of users to migrate their data between federated services is desirable, but any naive approach to this goal is a loaded gun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's... <em>bleak</em>. Where have all the techno-optimists gone?</p>
<p>It's unclear which participants shared concerns, as statements were anonymous. Perhaps DTI implemented Chatham House Rules. The event also notes that it can't provide an investigation and appeals process because the Data Transfer Initiative is "a small organization.” I hope Meta sprung for lunch.</p>
<p>The ACCESS Act was introduced in 2019 and reintroduced in 2022 and 2023. It would make data portability required by law. The bill is still under revision.</p>
<p>The RESTRICT Act, SAFE TECH Act, and Kids Online Safety Act also float around Congress. Each addresses one point in Zuckerberg's four-point plan.</p>
<p>The final versions of these bills could be a public good. Or, it could make starting your own social media company only possible with supplemental infrastructure. My bet is on whatever history would suggest.</p>
<h2 id="threads-net-is-the-new-app-net-but-with-ads-and-interoperable" tabindex="-1">threads.net is the new app.net but with ads and interoperable <a href="#threads-net-is-the-new-app-net-but-with-ads-and-interoperable">#</a></h2>
<p>Consider a scenario where Meta leadership believed its business model was no longer viable long-term. What would their first step look like?</p>
<p>It might look a lot like the now-defunct app.net.</p>
<p>App.net was a microblogging platform that tried to compete with Twitter. App.net had a robust API that allowed 3rd party developers to build on its infrastructure. What made the start-up unique was that its founders encouraged developers to create social media platforms with their own branding, features, and experiences.</p>
<p>Threads.net would market itself similarly but with a few key differences— interoperability, content ownership, and a revenue split program. These flagship features make the platform attractive to small developers and server admins.</p>
<p>Threads.net's potential flagship features:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Interoperability ‌</strong>: All third-party apps are connected, or “federated”. Users can engage, follow, and migrate between apps easily.</li>
<li><strong>Content Ownership</strong>: Unlike app.net, third-party developers and users "own” their published data. Each third-party platform has a distinct URL where content lives.</li>
<li><strong>Ad revenue split</strong>: threads.net offers a turnkey ad delivery system. Qualifying third-party developers and admins can enroll in a revenue split program. If approved, they gain a dependable revenue stream.</li>
</ol>
<p>An ad-revenue split would likely gain enthusiastic participation in the tech community. Most indie devs scrape by for years, and that's if they're lucky. The poor saps who receive VC funding get to watch their best feature copied on Instagram.</p>
<p>The interoperable and data storage features would also be widely supported. Martin Reece, creator of Micro.blog wrote about app.net in his online book. He suggested that what the start-up got wrong was its centralization.</p>
<p>From&nbsp;<em>Indie Microblogging</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The app.net team got so much right —&nbsp;the early crowdfunding, the well-designed API, the developer story — that I didn't notice what they had left out until much later.&nbsp;<strong>All data lived at&nbsp;<code>app.net</code>&nbsp;URLs, and when the platform was gone, all the posts and data went with it. There was no way to own your content.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Server admins would have their choice of third-party apps if they chose not to develop. For the adventurous, Meta would likely provide tools, resources, and UI kits for developing bespoke threads.net apps. Thanks to <a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/">Llama</a>, Meta's open-source AI development tool, almost anyone can build their very own social media platform. Perhaps even large influencers with the means and desire to create a branded experience.</p>
<p>Meta's vision for threads.net won't be a cakewalk, though. This market doesn't actually exist. Except it does, and Meta has already leached onto its network. All Mastodon server admins need is a push in the right direction.</p>
<h2 id="copy-acquire-and-kill" tabindex="-1">Copy, Acquire, and Kill <a href="#copy-acquire-and-kill">#</a></h2>
<p>In some ways, app.net failed where Mastodon succeeded. Eugene Rochko, Mastodon's CEO, has helped cultivate an impossibly vibrant social commons. He did it with zero ads, a decentralized network, and interoperable servers. If Meta could copy Mastodon's strategy, scale the ecosystem, and then monetize, it could pivot, <em>and</em> kill Mastodon at the same time.</p>
<p>The biggest lie in the Fediverse is that Mastodon is too small for Meta to care about. By all accounts and reason, that's simply not true. Zuck is in this impossible position because of how often and indiscriminately he kills off start-ups. Universities have <em>studied it.</em></p>
<p>Meta's <strong>Copy, Acquire, and Kill</strong> strategy is well documented. In 2020, Mark Zuckerberg faced a US Congress on allegations that Meta spies on small start-ups to identify targets for its insidious tactics.</p>
<p>Representative Pramila Jayapal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Your company uses data to spy on competitors and to copy, acquire, and kill rivals,” Jayapal added. "You've used Facebook's power to threaten smaller competitors and to ensure that you always get your way."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are some immediately apparent reasons why Meta is interested in Mastodon. None of which relate to building a better social media for regular folks. Mastodon has experienced server admins and nine million users that Meta can siphon after it fully invades the platform.</p>
<h2 id="a-thousand-little-nodes" tabindex="-1">A thousand little nodes <a href="#a-thousand-little-nodes">#</a></h2>
<p>My guess is Meta's plans are an open secret amongst the tech elite. A swarm of new micro blogging nodes are already buzzing around ActivityPub with great enthusiasm— Flipboard, Mozilla, Tumblr, Medium, Post.News, Pebble (previously T2), WordPress, Vivaldi, and Mammoth, to name a few. Some are even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/28/mozilla-leads-mastodon-app-mammoths-pre-seed-funding/amp/">well-funded</a>. None seem to have a viable monetization strategy. Shareholders can't buy a third house with the spirit of the open web, you guys.</p>
<p>As Meta pushes forward, we'll see more of these little nodes. Each will offer something unique, and Threads will be careful not to overlap. Post.news interoperable with a no-news Threads is perfect, don't you think?</p>
<p>But here's the question— why ActivityPub?</p>
<p>This is a tougher nut to crack. On the one hand, the protocol is a perfect fit for Meta's threads.net ambitions. But wouldn't the Data Transfer Project Initiative meet those needs as well? Perhaps. But DTI's "mission” isn't necessarily social, and I think Meta wants to keep it that way.</p>
<p>Look, there are lots of good people with the best intentions at every level of that project- er, initiative. But surely, Meta will use DTI to migrate Mastodon users over to threads.net at some point. By isolating the social graph portability to ActivityPub, Meta can swap the protocol out with something proprietary (and more restrictive) once it ditches the Fediverse.</p>
<p>In the end, ActivityPub still exists, but its platforms are a virtual wasteland. Some version of Mastodon lives on through threads.net. But at what cost?</p>
<h3 id="mark-s-catch-22" tabindex="-1">Mark's Catch 22 <a href="#mark-s-catch-22">#</a></h3>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg is in a bit of a pickle right now. If he could, I think he'd be cool just swallowing up start-ups and surfing with that white shit on his face the rest of his life. I think he wants to <em>avoid</em> pivoting to infrastructure. Was the whole Metaverse thing his last-ditch effort to do anything but Platform as a Service? I wonder.</p>
<p>Meta could've offered those services years ago. Instead, it routinely gives away its server architecture. Those contributions are the least objectionable thing about Meta.</p>
<p>But he can't <em>not</em> grow the company. Wall Street won't allow it. And he can't grow it through acquisition because of anti-trust. He's stuck.</p>
<p>After Cambridge Analytica, Meta couldn't buy a WordPress blog from Theme Forrest without the government up their ass. Zuck's biggest fear is anti-trust breaking up Instagram and WhatsApp. If he can remove the "Gatekeeper” characterization, he might have a chance to save his empire.</p>
<p>Infrastructure is Zuckerberg's only play. It's a good one, too. Effectively, four companies currently run the cloud. Barriers to entry are high, and infrastructure is costly. Just ask Meta. In the last four years, they've <a href="https://www.datacenterfrontier.com/hyperscale/article/11427952/facebook-showcases-its-40-million-square-feet-of-global-data-centers">spent billions</a> on non-Metaverse, non-AI data center expansion<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Today, all your favorite apps run on Amazon Web Services. Soon, all your social media will run on threads.net.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup></p>

</li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Since 2019, Meta grew from 15 to 21 data centers across the globe, with at least three more reportedly in construction. This activity is in <em>addition</em> to any Metaverse needs, as Meta signed a long-term contract with Amazon Web Services for its virtual reality computing. In February 2023, Data Center Frontier <a href="https://www.datacenterfrontier.com/hyperscale/article/21548840/meta-will-abandon-some-data-center-builds-run-servers-longer">reported Meta halted at least three data center projects</a>. Its architects achieved a breakthrough that extended the lifespans of its servers. Meta decided to include those updates in new centers, so it delayed construction. The improvements did <strong>not</strong> extend to AI-based servers. <a href="#fnref2">↩︎</a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-4836335289577539405" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>I've studied a lot of chips from the 1970s and 1980s, so I usually know what to expect.
But an Ethernet chip from 1982 had something new: a strange layer of yellow wiring on the die.
After some study, I learned that the yellow wiring is a second layer of resistive polysilicon, used in
the chip's static storage cells and latches.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/poly.jpg"><img alt="A closeup of the die of the LANCE chip. The metal has been removed to show the layers underneath." height="355" src="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/poly-w350.jpg" title="A closeup of the die of the LANCE chip. The metal has been removed to show the layers underneath." width="350"></a></p><p>A closeup of the die of the LANCE chip. The metal has been removed to show the layers underneath.</p>
<p>The die photo above shows a closeup of a latch circuit, with the diagonal yellow stripe in the middle.
For this photo, I removed the chip's metal layer so you can see the underlying circuitry.
The bottom layer, silicon, appears gray-purple under the microscope, with the active silicon regions slightly darker and bordered in black.
On top of the silicon, the pink regions are polysilicon, a special type of silicon.
Polysilicon has a critical role in the chip: when it crosses active silicon, polysilicon forms the gate of
a transistor. The circles are contacts between the metal layer and the underlying silicon or polysilicon.
So far, the components of the chip match most NMOS chips of that time.
But what about the bright yellow line crossing the circuit diagonally? That was new to me.
This second layer of polysilicon provides resistance. It crosses over the other layers, connected to the silicon at the ends with
a complex ring structure.</p>
<p>Why would you want high-resistance wiring in your digital chip? To understand this, let's first look at
how a bit can be stored.
An efficient way to store a bit is to connect two inverters in a loop, as shown below.
Each inverter sends the opposite value to the other inverter, so the circuit will be stable in two states,
holding one bit: a 1 or a 0.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/inverters.jpg"><img alt="Two cross-coupled inverters can store either a 0 or a 1 bit." height="161" src="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/inverters-w350.jpg" title="Two cross-coupled inverters can store either a 0 or a 1 bit." width="350"></a></p><p>Two cross-coupled inverters can store either a 0 or a 1 bit.</p>
<p>But how do you store a new value into the inverter loop? There are a few techniques.
One is to use pass transistors to break the loop, allowing a new value to be stored.
In the schematic below, if the <em>hold</em> signal is activated, the transistor turns on, completing the loop.
But if <em>hold</em> is dropped and <em>load</em> is activated, a new value can be loaded from the input into the inverter loop.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/pass-latch.png"><img alt="A latch, controlled by pass transistors." height="133" src="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/pass-latch-w300.png" title="A latch, controlled by pass transistors." width="300"></a></p><p>A latch, controlled by pass transistors.</p>
<p>An alternative is to use a weak inverter that produces a low-current output.
In this case, the input
signal can simply overpower the value produced by the inverter, forcing the loop into a new state.
The advantage of this circuit is that it
eliminates the "hold" transistor. However, a weak inverter turns out to be larger than a regular inverter,
negating much of the space saving.<span id="fnref:size"><a href="#fn:size">1</a></span> (The Intel 386 processor uses this type of latch.)</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/weak-latch.png"><img alt="A latch using a weak inverter." height="87" src="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/weak-latch-w300.png" title="A latch using a weak inverter." width="300"></a></p><p>A latch using a weak inverter.</p>
<p>A third alternative, used in the Ethernet chip, is to use a resistor for the feedback, limiting the
current.<span id="fnref:power"><a href="#fn:power">2</a></span>
As in the previous circuit, the input can overpower the low feedback current.
However, this circuit is more compact since it doesn't require a larger inverter.
The resistor doesn't require additional space since it can overlap the rest of the circuitry, as shown in the
photo at the top of the article.
The disadvantage is that manufacturing the die requires additional processing steps to create the resistive
polysilicon layer.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/latch-resistor.png"><img alt="A latch using a resistor for feedback." height="86" src="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/latch-resistor-w300.png" title="A latch using a resistor for feedback." width="300"></a></p><p>A latch using a resistor for feedback.</p>
<p>In the Ethernet chip, this type of latch is used in many circuits. For example, shift registers are built
by connecting latches in sequence, controlled by the clock signals.
Latches are also used to create binary counters, with the latch value toggled when the lower bits produce a carry.</p>
<h2>The SRAM cell</h2>
<p>It would be overkill to create a separate polysilicon layer just for a few latches.
It turns out that the chip was constructed with AMD's "64K dynamic RAM process".
Dynamic RAM uses tiny capacitors to store data. In the late 1970s, dynamic RAM chips started using
a "double-poly" process with one layer of polysilicon to form the capacitors and a second layer of polysilicon
for transistor gates and wiring (<a href="https://www.righto.com/2020/11/reverse-engineering-classic-mk4116-16.html">details</a>).</p>
<p>The double-poly process was also useful for shrinking the size of static RAM.<span id="fnref:patent-cell"><a href="#fn:patent-cell">3</a></span>
The Ethernet chip contains several blocks of storage buffers for various purposes. These blocks are implemented as static RAM,
including a 22×16 block, a 48×9 block, and a 16×7 block.
The photo below shows a closeup of some storage cells, showing how they are arranged in a regular grid.
The yellow lines of resistive polysilicon are visible in each cell.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/storage.jpg"><img alt="A block of 28 storage cells in the chip. Some of the second polysilicon layer is damaged." height="363" src="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/storage-w500.jpg" title="A block of 28 storage cells in the chip. Some of the second polysilicon layer is damaged." width="500"></a></p><p>A block of 28 storage cells in the chip. Some of the second polysilicon layer is damaged.</p>
<p>A static RAM storage cell is roughly similar to the latch cell, with two inverters in
a loop to store each bit.
However, the storage is arranged in a grid: each row corresponds to a particular word, and each column
corresponds to the bits in a word.
To select a word, a word select line is activated, turning on the pass transistors in that row.
Reading and writing the cell is done through a pair of bitlines; each bit has a bitline and a complemented bitline.
To read a word, the bits in the word are accessed through the bitlines.
To write a word, the new value and its complement are applied to the bitlines, forcing the inverters into
the desired state.
(The bitlines must be driven with a high-current signal that can overcome the signal from the inverters.)</p>

<p>The diagram below shows the physical layout of one memory cell, consisting of two resistors and four transistors.
The black lines indicate the vertical metal wiring that was removed.
The schematic on the right corresponds to the physical arrangement of the circuit.
Each inverter is constructed from a transistor and a pull-up resistor, and the inverters are connected into a loop.
(The role of these resistors is completely different from the feedback resistors in the latch.)
The two transistors at the bottom are the pass transistors that provide access to the cell for reads or writes.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/cell-labeled.jpg"><img alt="One memory cell static memory cell as it appears on the die, along with its schematic." height="408" src="https://static.righto.com/images/lance-poly/cell-labeled-w600.jpg" title="One memory cell static memory cell as it appears on the die, along with its schematic." width="600"></a></p><p>One memory cell static memory cell as it appears on the die, along with its schematic.</p>
<p>The layout of this storage cell is highly optimized to minimize its area. Note that the yellow resistors take
almost no additional area, as they overlap other parts of the cell.
If constructed without resistors, each inverter would require an additional transistor, making the cell larger.</p>
<p>To summarize, although the double-poly process was introduced for DRAM capacitors, it can also be used for SRAM cell pull-up resistors.
Reducing the size of the SRAM cells was probably the motivation to use this process for the Ethernet chip, with
the latch feedback resistors a secondary benefit.</p>
<h2>The Am7990 LANCE Ethernet chip</h2>
<p>I'll wrap up with some background on the AMD Ethernet chip.
Ethernet was invented in 1973 at Xerox PARC and became a standard in 1980.
Ethernet was originally implemented with a board full of chips, mostly TTL. 
By the early 1980s, companies such as Intel, Seeq, and AMD introduced chips to put most of the circuitry onto VLSI chips. 
These chips reduced the complexity of Ethernet interface hardware, causing the price to drop from <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=3kpkQKds0lAC&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">$2000</a> to $1000.</p>
<p>The chip that I'm examining is AMD's Am7990 LANCE (Local Area Network Controller for Ethernet).
This chip implemented much of the functionality for Ethernet and "Cheapernet" (now known as 10BASE2 Ethernet).
The chip handles serial/parallel conversion,
computing the 32-bit CRC checksum, handling collisions and backoff, and recognizing desired addresses.
The chip also provides DMA access for interfacing with a microcomputer.</p>
<p>The chip doesn't handle everything, though.
It was designed to work with an Am7992 Serial Interface Adapter chip that encodes and decodes the bitstream
using Manchester encoding.
The third chip was the Am7996 transceiver that handled the low-level signaling and interfacing with the coaxial network cable, as well as
detecting collisions if two nodes transmitted at the same time.</p>
<p>The LANCE chip is fairly complicated.
The die photo below shows the main functional blocks of the chip.
The chip is controlled by the large block of microcode ROM in the lower right.
The large dark rectangles are storage, implemented with the static RAM cells described above.
The chip has 48 pins, connected by tiny bond wires to the square pads around the edges of the die.</p>

  <div>
    <p>Since August 2018 I have run a social network site called Friend Camp for about 50 of my friends. I think Friend Camp is a really nice place, and my friends seem to agree that it has enriched our lives. I'd like to see more places like Friend Camp on the internet, and this document is my attempt to provide some practical guidance as to how you might run a social network site like this.</p>
    
  </div>
  <h3><a id="who-this-guide-is-for"></a>Who this guide is for</h3>
  <p>If you're tired of Facebook or Twitter or wherever else and have thought that there's got to be a better way, this is for you.</p>
  <p>If you currently run a social network server for people besides just you, using software <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> or <a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a> or whatever else, this is for you.</p>
  <p>If you have some programming experience, this is for you.</p>
  <p>If you have no programming experience, this is for you.</p>
  <h3><a id="social-solutions-to-social-problems"></a>Social solutions to social problems</h3>
  <div>
    <p>This document exists to lay out some general principles of running a small social network site that have worked for me. These principles are related to community building more than they are related to specific technologies. This is because the big problems with social network sites are not technical: the problems are social problems related to things like policy, values, and power.</p>
    
  </div>
  <p>Running a social network site is community building first and a technical task second.</p>
  <p>And while community building is hard work, it's often worth it.</p>
  <div>
    <p>This is my pitch to you: using big social media sites is easy, but you pay a steep price for it. You should consider running your own site, which is harder, but can be extremely rewarding.</p>
    
  </div>
</section>
<section>
  <h2><a id="what-makes-a-small-social-network-site-different-from-a-big-one?"></a>What makes a small social network site different from a big one?</h2>
  <p>Friend Camp looks like this on a desktop web browser:</p>
  <figure>

  <p>And like this on phones:</p>

    <figcaption>The phone view of Friend Camp.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <div>
    <p>It's fairly Twitter-like at first blush: you post short messages, you can "@" individual users, you can follow and be followed, you can use hashtags, and you can boost things that you want your followers to see. While Friend Camp is small, the universe of content we have access to is big. We are connected to about 5,000 other communities on the web, allowing us to interact with hundreds of thousands of users if we want.</p>
    
  </div>
  <p>So far, this seems like an underpowered Twitter, but there are some key differences from Twitter:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>you control the computer that runs the site</li>
  <li>you can modify the software that powers the site</li>
  <li>you get to make the rules and policies</li>
  
  </ul>
  <p>Next I'll explain each of these in detail.</p>
  <h3><a id="you-control-the-computer-that-runs-the-site"></a>You control the computer that runs the site</h3>
  <p>Big social media sites all run on computers, usually a big complex network of computers. When you type "facebook.com" into your browser or load up your Facebook app, what happens is that your phone sends a message to a computer owned by Facebook, which then coordinates with a bunch of other computers owned by Facebook to collect all the information that is then displayed to you.</p>
  <p>In the context of Facebook, this means that everything you do on Facebook passes through computers that they control. And then they take the information about what you do and sell it to advertisers, directly or indirectly.</p>
  <p>But a small social network site doesn't need a huge complex network of computers. One computer can be enough. Often it's the kind of thing you can rent for $10 a month, or even run at home on an old computer you have lying around if you want.</p>
  <p>For example, Friend Camp <a href="#funding">costs about $30 a month to run</a>, it experiences about 10 minutes of down time each week, and it takes about 2 hours a week of my own time to maintain. I maintain the computer that Friend Camp's software runs on. I'm training another camper to be an administrator as well, so if something happens to me there is still someone who can make sure the site keeps going. The site is funded by campers who can afford to throw a few bucks a month at a Patreon that I run just for us. It's a small price to pay for a nice place to talk to friends on the internet.</p>
  <p>As a result of these economic realities, Friend Camp does not have the annoyances of big social network sites. We sell no data, we collect no extraneous data, there are no advertisements at all, and no major features get changed unless I talk to the campers about it first.</p>
  <p>Another result of these economic realities is that we're never going to grow much bigger than 50 active users. But that's okay, because it keeps costs low and we can still talk to people outside of our server.</p>
  <p>You might ask: how can one small computer replace something as huge as Facebook in my life? Well, the reason is that you control this one computer for your site, and then that computer talks to thousands of other computers, which gives you access to literally millions of people and organizations and videos and all sorts of other things. So what this does is replace thousands of computers owned by a single company with thousands of computers owned by thousands of different people.</p>
  <h3><a id="you-can-modify-the-software"></a>You can modify the software</h3>
  <div>
    <p>You don't have access to the code and the algorithms that Twitter uses to run their service. If I wanted Twitter to make it so that the word "tomato" always appears in bright red, I would have to submit a request to Twitter, and then they would laugh at me, and that would be the end of it. But on Friend Camp, I have the ability to change our code to do exactly that.</p>
    
  </div>
  <p>A silly example of this kind of rule in action is <a href="https://dolphin.town/">Dolphin Town</a>, a fully functioning social network site that I started a couple years ago. Like Friend Camp, it's a modification of <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>. It behaves just like Mastodon with one important change: the only letter you are allowed to use is "E".</p>
  <div>
    <figure>
      <img src="https://runyourown.social/img/dolphin-town-screenshot.png" alt="A screenshot of Dolphin Town. It looks like Twitter except everyone is saying things like &quot;Eee, eee eee!&quot;" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
      <figcaption>Dolphin Town in action.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
  </div>
  <p>The reason I can make these modifications is that Mastodon is <em>open source</em>. There are a lot of things that open source software enables, but for our purposes the important thing is that you can open up the software, tinker with it, and put it back together in its newly modified state.</p>
  <p>I made Dolphin Town to draw attention to something that I think a lot of people miss: if you run a social network based on open source software, you can fundamentally alter how it works to your liking, at least for the version that runs on the computer you own.</p>
  <h3><a id="you-get-to-makes-the-social-rules-and-policies"></a>You get to make the social rules and policies</h3>
  <p>On a big site like Facebook, if you encounter content that you think shouldn't be there, you need to ask Facebook to take it down.</p>
  <p>On a small site serving a small community, if the content comes from inside your community, then you can navigate it the way you navigate problems in small communities in the real world. You bring up with the rest of your community that someone is behaving in a way that is counter to the values of the community. It's unpleasant, but at least you have some control over that process, and it's something tangible that you can navigate.</p>
  <p>It's more work than simply letting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18681845/facebook-moderator-interviews-video-trauma-ptsd-cognizant-tampa">an army of underpaid and traumatized moderators</a> handle all of that for you. But it's worth it. (You might sense "it's hard work but it's worth it" as an ongoing theme.)</p>
  <h3><a id="wait,-who-is-%22you%22?"></a>Wait, who is "you"?</h3>
  <p>When I refer to "you" here I mean "your community" and "your decision making process". Some communities may have a single person who is kind of the "benevolent dictator". Other communities may run based on consensus or even more formal processes.</p>
  <p>Some servers are formal cooperatives that use <a href="https://www.loomio.org/">cooperative decision making tools like Loomio</a> to organize their node, which has its own advantages and drawbacks that I won't go into the details of here. Tools like Loomio are important when your group gets to a size that is too big to manage informally. This is why I am very much in favor of <a href="#keep-it-small">keeping these sites really small</a>, like way less than 100 people. It allows decision making to stay informal and means that running the site can be a hobby or a low-intensity community project instead of a full time job.</p>
  <p>And of course nothing is going to stop a corporation from running one of these sites either! But I don't recommend joining a corporate site; these things will eventually be driven by profit motive to replicate the same bad experience you get on the current social network sites that you hate.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2><a id="why-run-a-small-social-network-site?"></a>Why run a small social network site?</h2>
  <p>The main reason to run a small social network site is that you can create an online environment tailored to the needs of your community in a way that a big corporation like Facebook or Twitter never could. Yes, you can always start a Facebook Group for your community and moderate that how you like, but only within certain bounds set by Facebook. If you (or your community) run the whole site, then you are ultimately the boss of what goes on. It is harder work than letting Facebook or Twitter or Slack or Basecamp or  whoever else take care of everything, but I believe it's worth it.</p>
  <div>
    <p>Let's go back to Friend Camp. While there are a hundred thousand people we can talk to from Friend Camp, there are only about 50 people with an active Friend Camp login. We call ourselves "campers" because we are corny like that. And campers have a special communication channel that lets us post messages that only other campers can see.</p>
    
  </div>
  <p>Because we're mostly all friends with each other, this extra communications mode is kind of like a group chat on steroids. For our community it ends up being a sort of hybrid between Twitter and a group chat. As a result of having a community layer alongside a more public layer, we have a movie night, a book club, and a postcard club. Campers visit each other when we travel, even if we've never met in person before. We correspond with each other about what we're making for dinner and trade recipes. They're the kind of mundane interactions that you probably don't want to have with perfect strangers but you cherish in a group of people you care about.</p>
  <p>We are also able to have moderation rules that are hyper-specific to our own values as a community. It lets us maintain an environment that's far more pleasant than you find on most social media sites.</p>
  <p>And I can make custom features at the request of the people on the site. So if someone wants a particular kind of visual theme, or content filter, or a button to do something that the software can't do right now, I can make it happen, at least within the limits of my own ability.</p>
  <h3><a id="software-can-be-complicated-where-necessary"></a>Software can be complicated where necessary</h3>
  <p>There are certain things that are notoriously subtle and complex to communicate to users passively via a user interface. A classic example is security settings: Facebook, for example, offers a lot of decent security options but it can be overwhelming to many users. Of course, by having reasonable defaults you can get past this problem, but any default setting is at best going to work for some but not all users.</p>
  <p>For example, Mastodon has four levels of privacy available for your posts, ranging from "a private message to another person" to "anyone on the internet can see this". According to some discussions I've seen, one reason that Mastodon has been reluctant to add a "local-only" posting option to its service is that it multiplies that to a combination of eight total privacy settings. The idea is that it would confuse people and they would potentially use it wrong, which could lead to bad security breaches due to user error in dealing with a complex design.</p>
  <p>I agree with this in a situation where a user tries out Mastodon and has to learn to use it themselves. But in a case like Friend Camp, I can personally walk the user through what these complex features mean. I can tailor the instruction to their personal learning style and to their needs. Plus, I'm available to answer questions about it whenever they come up.</p>
  <p>I'll discuss this more below in the section <a href="#what-you-can-do-today">"What you can do today"</a>.</p>
  <p>All that said, there's no need for overly complicated software. It should be as simple as possible. But in cases like security and privacy I think the ability to granularly control your settings outweighs factors like ease of use.</p>
  <h3><a id="you-can-have-hyper-specific-norms"></a>You can have hyper-specific norms</h3>
  <p>Because of their need to have as many users as possible, big social network sites have to try to be everything to everyone. In practice this means they need to limit the number of people they alienate, which means they have to be very careful about what kinds of actions and speech they ban on their network. Every person they ban from their network is another set of eyeballs that could otherwise be looking at advertisements and making them money.</p>
  <p>In the end, this means everyone is going to be unhappy with the policies of a big site. You can see it right now on Twitter and Facebook: people on the left complain that these sites support right wing extremism, and people on the right complain that these sites support left wing extremism. And for a website with thousands of posts a second from hundreds of millions of potential sources that's aiming to please as many people as possible, both of these viewpoints are absolutely going to be true. There is no way to moderate this effectively, and you can never come up with rules for behavior that make millions of people happy.</p>
  <p>But on a small social network site, you can set hyper-specific norms. For example, Mastodon allows for "content warnings", where you hide content behind a text tag that you define for your post. It's often things like "nsfw" or "mental health discussion". This acts as a warning so people who don't want to read about that kind of stuff won't click through to see it. On Friend Camp, we generally tag anything related to United States politics as "uspol" — we didn't invent this tag, and lots of other servers use it too. I couldn't ever imagine people tagging politics tweets on Twitter, since Twitter styles itself as a news network, for the broadest possible interpretation of the word "news".</p>
  <p>You also don't need to implement some kind of draconian filtering system to have norms: you simply model the behavior you want to see, and remind people to act a certain way when they post outside of those norms. This kind of thing does not work well in a forum of even 200 people, but in the 50-ish range it is entirely doable.</p>
  <p>Your small social network site can have its own rules about, for example: </p>
  <ul>
  <li>what speech is acceptable</li>
  <li>what actions are considered violence</li>
  <li>what actions are considered protected speech or expression</li>
  
  </ul>
  <p>This will be very different for every site and I think that's part of the beauty of this whole thing. I talk more about the specifics of this in the <a href="#what-you-can-do-today">"What you can do today" section</a> below.</p>
  <h3><a id="why-to-not-run-a-small-social-network-site"></a>Why to NOT run a small social network site</h3>
  <p>There are many reasons not to run a small social network site. As I've mentioned before and will continue to mention, it's really hard work. You need to at least have time for a hobby or figure out a way to get community support for doing it (maybe people chip in to keep things running; maybe you can trade in-kind services with your community members; etc.).</p>
  <div>
    <p>If you choose to run a site like this, it means that people will now depend on you for something that's important to them. People on Friend Camp are very forgiving when we have down time, and sometimes that down time can last hours if I'm asleep or at a movie or otherwise busy. Later in this document <a href="#keep-it-small">I discuss some cases where people had to abandon a site because it got too big and unwieldy to run</a>.</p>
    
  </div>
  <p>But none of this is unique to running a social network site. I think all of this stuff applies if you take away the internet and computers entirely. This is exactly the cost of starting a community theater group, activist group, social group, sports club, book club, and so on. Even the bit about "down time" applies if you run a physical space like a theater. You can't be there for every performance but if something goes wrong with the building, you'd better have a plan to deal with it.</p>
  <p>In other words, the costs of running a small social network site end up being more or less the costs of starting, well, anything involving other people.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2><a id="what-you-can-do-today"></a>What you can do today</h2>
  <p>This section describes practices that anyone running Mastodon or similar software can do today to make for a cohesive, rewarding, and caring community. This section lays out some rules that have helped make Friend Camp a good place. The high level overview is:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>keep the number of users on your server very small</li>
  <li>remember that your job is social first and technical second</li>
  <li>provide custom onboarding</li>
  <li>provide group activities</li>
  <li>provide custom features if you can</li>
  <li>enforce your code of conduct</li>
  </ul>
  <h3><a id="keep-it-small"></a>Keep it small</h3>
  <p>It is absolutely necessary to have no more than 50 to 100 active users who log in to your online community.</p>
  <p>This is a number I am pulling out of my ass. And eagle-eyed readers will notice that I'm not even settling on a single number here. I know that 50 is a number that works as a cap, and I think anything more than 100 definitely does not work as a cap.</p>
  <div>
    <p>In my admittedly limited experience as a human being on this planet, you are not going to be able to form and maintain a cohesive group of more than about 50 to 100 people who all basically agree on values and moderation rules and that sort of stuff. Even as a group where people are mutually looking out for each other, you are not going to be able to meaningfully make sure everyone in that group's wellbeing is maintained. I don't have science to back this up. I have seen this happen in startups, in activist groups, and in internet forums.</p>
    
  </div>
  <p><strong>I can't stress enough how important it is to keep your numbers small.</strong> To draw from recent history, witches.town was one of the more popular Mastodon servers in 2017 and 2018. In mid-2018 there were a series of disagreements between the primary administrator and the users. I can't speak to the nature of these disagreements as I wasn't there but there were multiple disagreements about moderation policy, and also the primary administrator (who I believe actually owned the server and its domain) said they were burned out on running the server. In the end, the site was shut down. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180307044118/https://witches.town/about/more">According to archive.org it had about 2400 registered accounts in April 2018</a>, shortly before the instance was deleted. If we look at instances of similar size today we can extrapolate that there were perhaps 500 active users on the server at the time it went dark. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190627101519/https://knzk.me/about">KNZK</a> is another network site that shut down on June 30th 2019 and it had about 3100 registered accounts and 560 active users. It shut down due to maintenance tasks <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190627183952/https://knzk.me/@Knzk/102191413727426394">demanding too much time and effort from administrators</a>.</p>
  <div>
    <p>I posit that 500 active, invested community members will not be able to achieve a values-based harmony or consensus. It's simply too big to be possible. My assertion is not backed up by any studies I have read but rather my personal experience in online and offline groups of all kinds. You cannot wrangle consensus from 500 people. With that many active, committed community members you will necessarily have at least a few dedicated members who feel investment and ownership in the community who are also extremely unhappy with the direction of the community. </p>
    
  </div>
  <p>In addition to promoting group cohesion, having a small number of active users means moderation is completely achievable by a single person. With 50 active users I field, on average, one moderation request a month. This is in addition to me being vigilant and blocking bad actors as I see them. Now, this wouldn't be true if I had 50 random people who all signed up. But these are 50 users who are screened and onboarded into our community.</p>
  <p>Even tricky matters like delineating what is and is not acceptable speech become easier when you're dealing with a small community. For example, there may be some inalienable right for expression of disagreeable political speech, but if it is speech that all the people on your corner of the network agree you don't want to see, you can simply ban it internally and filter or block it externally.</p>
  <p>And when your community is small, you can use powerful tools that would be irresponsible to wield in a larger community. For example, when I discover a user on someone else's site engaging in speech that violates our local norms, I will often mute or ban the entire server that hosts the user in question on behalf of all the people on Friend Camp. This would be inadvisable on a huge network like Twitter, but on Friend Camp, we have all agreed we don't want to see certain things and we don't want to engage with other servers that allow for those types of speech.</p>
  <p>Of course, the question is how does this scale beyond those 50 people? Well, that is why I'm writing this guide. I think there should be thousands of these small servers talking to each other.</p>
  <h3><a id="you-are-the-party-host"></a>You are the party host</h3>
  <p>Running a small social network is like hosting a party. It requires social intelligence, empathy, and yes, technical skills.</p>
  <p>You might wonder what aspect of hosting a party is technical. I mean "technical" in the sense of "requiring technique and skill". Party hosts need all sorts of technical skills: managing RSVPs and calendars, planning and purchasing supplies, cooking and serving, wrangling a music playlist, etc. Not everyone is comfortable hosting a party because these are technical barriers to entry. Similarly, not everyone is comfortable running social network software because of technical barriers to entry.</p>
  <p>But as with hosting a party, technical skills aren't enough. You need to have social skills, or have someone assisting you who does.</p>
  <div>
    <p>For example, I need to maintain an understanding of everyone on the server. I have to remember what their individual needs are, which means that I need to be able to hold all of that information in my head. It's not a task that everyone is suited to, but it's critically important.</p>
    
  </div>
  <p>Among other things, my duty is to read the local timeline and catch up on everyone's posts. I need to take the temperature of the network and also provide social lubrication where necessary. ("Hey, you just mentioned you're traveling to Montreal! So-and-so lives there, maybe you should message them and see if they want to meet up.") Catching up on all local posts would take forever with hundreds of active users, but with dozens, I only have to read the timeline for 20 minutes a day.</p>
  <p>Do not fool yourself into thinking that your job as an administrator is primarily technical. It's social first, and technical second. If you want to only focus on the tech, then please find someone who cares deeply about the social organizing side and recruit them as a co-administrator.</p>
  <h3><a id="provide-a-custom-introduction-to-your-network-for-every-user"></a>Provide a custom introduction to your network for every user</h3>
  <p>Because you only have 50 people in your community, you are able to do all sorts of things that would never be possible in a larger group. One really important place where this comes into play is in new user onboarding.</p>
  <div>
    <p>When a new user joins Friend Camp, I now schedule a video chat with them (or an in-person chat if they are local). For one to three hours, I introduce them to Friend Camp and walk them through our basic features. I customize the content of the chat with them depending on their background. Generally we discuss the following topics:</p>
    
  </div>
  <ul>
  <li>the basics of using Mastodon, tailored to the individual's needs</li>
  <li>how to find further help if they need it</li>
  <li>who <em>everyone</em> on the server is (I go down the list and explain in one sentence who every non-private user is, kind of like a party host might introduce guests to one another)</li>
  <li>our custom software features</li>
  <li>our group traditions and how to participate in them (movie night, for example)</li>
  
  </ul>
  <p>If I know them to be social media power users, I'll spend more time on those kinds of features. If they are not very technical and need more basic training, then I spend more time on that. I'll ask them what kind of phone they use, and give them specific information about iOS or Android as needed.</p>
  <p>In addition to explaining who everyone else on the server is, I point out specific people who I think they might get along with. Again, it's like being a party host. If you know people in common or have common interests, I will mention that.</p>
  <p>This is one of those things that a small social network site can provide that a big site could <em>never</em> provide, because it just doesn't scale.</p>
  <h3><a id="group-activities"></a>Group activities</h3>
  <p>It's important to do things together as a group. Organize whatever makes sense for your community, and allow your community to organize as well.</p>
  <p>For example, on Friend Camp we have: movie night, book club, postcard club. Not everyone participates in these things, and that's okay too. But the option is there. The people on your site will probably want different activites than these specific ones, but the important thing about this is we are connecting through some kind of shared activity.</p>
  <h3><a id="keep-it-interconnected"></a>Keep it interconnected</h3>
  <p>The ultimate goal of the last three sections (hosting a party, custom onboarding, group activities) is to socialize everyone on your server with everyone else on your server.  Not everyone has to get along with or even interact with everyone else, but the more positive connections you build between people on your server the better a place it will be. Having a tight-knit group where lots of people know each other is key to the principle of maintaining <a href="#you-can-have-hyper-specific-norms">hyper-specific norms</a>.</p>
  <p>An interconnected network also helps with conflict resolution, so when things go "wrong" it's hardly noticeable. As one camper put it to me:</p>
  <blockquote>"Tiny scale conflict resolves between people without formal moderation. Alice says something that Bob didn't like, Bob points it out, Alice agrees and apologizes, and everyone moves on."
  </blockquote>
  <p>That kind of conflict resolution doesn't easily happen between strangers, even in a group where people share values with one another. But when the chance of any two people being complete strangers is close to zero, this happens way more frequently.</p>
  <h3><a id="funding"></a>Funding</h3>
  <p>Unfortunately, running a social network node requires you to move electrons around on pieces of metal, which means you need metal and electricity. And to have access to those resources, you need some kind of funding. Either you have a benefactor, you get together as a group and buy some equipment and internet service and pay for repairs, or pay a company like Linode some money to host a server for you.</p>
  <p>We have a Patreon for Friend Camp simply because it's the easiest way for me to collect monthly donations. Campers contribute what they want or what they can. I needed to upgrade our server at some point for various reasons and I made an appeal to the community. I ended up getting the monthly pledges to cover the new server costs for everyone. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mRtQiH1ZeK5HzPnocwfQmUutHVAhpusxcGq44hsKF7E/">The monetary costs of running Friend Camp are laid out in this spreadsheet.</a> At the moment, Friend Camp costs $31.00 a month to run. This is not a small cost for a single person, but spread between 50 people it can be very affordable, more like $1 per month per person even if half the active users can't afford to contribute anything.</p>
  <h3><a id="the-bus-problem"></a>The bus problem</h3>
  <p>For almost a year, Friend Camp had one person with the keys to the kingdom: me. In this first year, if I got hit by a bus, the server would probably run until its first crash and then never come back again. </p>
  <p>I decided to put out the word to see if a member of the community would be able to volunteer to be co-administrator. Thankfully, one of our own decided to take on the responsibility. I was lucky that there was a person in the community willing to do this and with development experience and experience running a server. It took just a handful of video calls to get them up to speed and within a month they had pushed their first production upgrade to Friend Camp.</p>
  <p>Not every community is going to have people who are willing and able to take on these duties. But if you have someone willing, there could be a longer mentoring process to get them to the point where they are able to do at least minimal work to maintain the server in the absence of the main administrator. If someone is at least able to reboot the server if things go weird, that's a huge step up from nothing.</p>
  <p>Ideally you can train a willing person to the point where they can do more complicated administrative tasks. If you have a small social network community that actually really means something to you, it's work that helps keep a thing alive that people deeply care about.</p>
  <h3><a id="code-of-conduct"></a>Code of Conduct</h3>
  <p>A code of conduct (CoC) is about what actions are acceptable on a network, which is absolutely necessary but not sufficient on its own for establishing a culture. A CoC perhaps implies certain values but it mostly states what is NOT acceptable rather than what IS encouraged. Some codes of conduct do state things like "please engage with people courteously" etc.</p>
  <div>
    <p>I think a good CoC should be specific enough that it is actively repulsive to some people. And frankly, the more people who are repulsed by it the better. Perhaps simple anti-racist sentiment is enough to repulse a small number of explicitly white supremacist people, but if you add in sentiment like "no <abbr title="Transgender Exclusionary Radical Feminists">TERFs</abbr> allowed", suddenly a lot of people who consider themselves leftists will also decide not to join. As an example, Friend Camp is anti-free-speech, at least in the sense that freedom of speech is commonly understood as a value. This is repulsive to some people on both the left and the right, and it's important that people with that core value find somewhere other than Friend Camp to set up their online home.</p>
    
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Again this is a <em>good thing</em>. I remember one code of conduct I read for a chat forum where they stated that "before posting here, ask yourself if what you are saying is necessary for the health of the discourse". And I saw that and thought, "Wow, I would never feel comfortable posting on that forum because I am always doubting the necessity of what I have to say." This is good, though. The forum clearly signaled that they wanted a certain kind of person, one who is confident in the necessity of their speech. And that is not me, and I was able to steer clear. Did I feel excluded? Sure. But ultimately that feeling of pre-emptive exclusion is better than joining a community and THEN realizing that I don't belong there.</p>
    
  </div>
  <h4><a id="enforcement"></a>Enforcement</h4>
    <p>Valerie Aurora and Mary Gardiner have published a free book called <a href="https://frameshiftconsulting.com/code-of-conduct-book/"><em>How to Respond to Code of Conduct Reports</em></a> that I think is required reading for anyone with a code of conduct on their site. The book explains what a CoC is <em>and what it is not</em> and how to make yours actually effective. Some of their recommendations make more sense for very large communities (like conferences of thousands of people) than the small ones I'm advocating for, but most of their recommendations do apply, and the book comes with many real world examples that you can learn from.</p>
  <div>
    <p>One reason I'm a big fan of adding a local-only communication layer to these social network sites is that it helps with enforcement. The reason is that it creates serious social repercussions for violating rules to the point where you're kicked off of a server. This is because the person who was kicked out cannot just join a new server and re-follow everyone and continue to participate in or monitor conversations. It's more like being kicked from a group chat. It can be socially devastating, which  means there are real consequences to violating group policy.</p>
    
  </div>
  <p>I'm sure there will be friction on Friend Camp but nobody has, to my knowledge, broken our code of conduct or otherwise required admonishment or disciplinary action. When that does happen and it is beyond a simple warning followed by an apology, I will individually solicit opinions from literally every active user on what should be done. Because we keep the server small, I could in theory host video calls with every single user where we discuss what ought to be done. I'm not sure if that last one is a good idea but I have that option, which you can't say for Facebook. This is all possible because we are a small group of people and we will never be a big group of people.</p>
  <h3><a id="technical-recommendations"></a>Technical recommendations</h3>
  <p><em>This section might not make a lot of sense if you're not a programmer. Feel free to skip it and move to <a href="#what-we-need-to-do-in-the-future">"What we need to do in the future"</a> if that's not you.</em></p>
  <p>Ideally you will pick social media software that has features which allow for communication that only your users on your server can see. In the case of Friend Camp, we maintain Friend Camp as <a href="https://github.com/friendcamp/mastodon/">a fork of Mastodon</a> and pull in <a href="https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon/pull/8427">Renato Lond's great work</a> that allows for posts that only the 50 people with logins to Friend Camp can see.  I would go so far as to say this is a necessary feature for group cohesion, and my hope is that implementors of decentralized social media software come to understand it's important.</p>
  <p>If you are a programmer, I suggest that you maintain a fork of whatever open source social network software you end up using so that you can implement custom features for your users. You might end up making purely aesthetic changes, small browser hacks, or complicated new features that you need to maintain version to version. If you implement custom features that your users ask for, it gives them a stronger sense of ownership over the site even if they are not the ones writing the software. Make sure to credit them somewhere too! I try to credit individual users for each suggested feature in the commit messages and also on our server's About page.</p>
  <p>Provide multiple services for your community members! Probably not email because that is a nightmare but there are other possibilities. I use Mastodon's login to authenticate small helper applications that I write for my users. I just put in a hard coded gateway so that only people from my server have access to them (so their OAuth login account has to originate from the server friend.camp). This means the basic social media login for your server is also a login for many other services; kind of like a default LDAP but not.</p>
  <h4><a id="examples-of-services-you-can-provide"></a>Examples of services you can provide</h4>
  <div>
    <p>I only have one auxilary service I provide my users that gets active use but I think it's a big one. Bugle is a bot that any Friend Camper can use that sends a direct message to <em>every other person on the server</em> (unless they have blocked it or have DMs otherwise disabled). This would normally be a horrible idea on a site like Twitter. But because we're a small community and we all know each other, I trust that my users will use it well and sparingly. If it is misused I will give the user a stern talking-to.</p>
    
  </div>
</section>
<section>
  <h2><a id="what-we-need-to-do-in-the-future"></a>What we need to do in the future</h2>
  <p>The current situation for small social network sites is not even close to perfect. There is work that needs to be done to make this idea better and more viable for more kinds of people.</p>
  <h3><a id="places-where-we-need-better-tech"></a>Places where we need better tech </h3>
  <p>Most of the problems that exist are social problems with social solutions, and I've tried to lay some of those out above. But there are still unsolved problems where better tech could really help, so I'll try to enumerate those here.</p>
  <h4><a id="fluidity-of-identity-and-the-ability-to-migrate"></a>Fluidity of identity and the ability to migrate</h4>
  <p>The existence of a server and an administrator implies some local form of centralization. I think this is necessary because most people don't want to run their own network node, and there are fantastic benefits to having a trusted local administrator. That said, the drawbacks are also great and we need to be able to mitigate the drawbacks.</p>
  <p>What happens if I, as the administrator, violate the social norms of my own community? In other words, <em>what happens if the person with all the real power is the problem</em>?</p>
  <p>People <em>need</em> to be able to jump ship and migrate their accounts, seamlessly and wholly, to other servers. We do not have a good technical solution for this yet. In my opinion it is the one big area regarding federated social networks where we need to work on technical solutions.</p>
  <p>If I decide that my values no longer align with a server, I need to be able to take that account to a new server. If the server decides to kick me off, that's fine, but I should <em>in theory</em> be able to set up shop elsewhere. </p>
  <p>I know that people have been working on this issue, but as far as I'm aware it's nowhere near resolved. As it stands right now, the fact that you can't uproot and take your stuff with you from one site to another means there is a very real kind of lock-in. This helps with enforcement (as I said above) but is a huge liability when it's simply the choice of the individual to move.</p>
  <h4><a id="let-people-keep-things-in-the-community"></a>Let people keep things in the community</h4>
  <p>Most open source social network software right now is designed to get your messages out to as many people as possible. We need support for private communities. For federated social networks this means support for messages that don't federate and can only be viewed by people with access to the server on which the message was posted.</p>
  <div>
    <p>Unlike the identity problem, this is a very easy thing to implement technically. It already exists on a minority of open source social network servers. But the big players don't support it and that's causing more harm than good.</p>
    
  </div>
  <h4><a id="server-forking-should-be-easy"></a>Server forking should be easy</h4>
  <p>It should be easy for, say, 25 members of Friend Camp to pick up and start "Friend Camp 2". This could be because Friend Camp is getting too big, or it could be because these people don't like what Friend Camp has become and would like to move en masse.</p>
  <p>As far as I'm aware there is no work at all being done on this issue, but I suppose a prerequisite to this is a solution to the identity migration problem above.</p>
  <h4><a id="lean-software-that-doesn%27t-have-to-scale"></a>Lean software that doesn't have to scale</h4>
  <p>What if we built software to run on very low spec, low power machines, that was a federated social media server for 50 people but could never grow to support more than that? You could use something like SQLite instead of a "real" database because you'd never realistically have to support a lot of writes to the DB. You could run on a raspberry pi.</p>
  <p>There are some federated servers that fit this bill already. <a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</a> is a Twitter style server that extremely light on its use of resources. And <a href="https://writefreely.org/">Write Freely</a>, a federated Medium-style blogging server, is incredibly lean as well.</p>
  <p>But even Pleroma and Write Freely are built with thousands of users in mind. What kind of <a href="https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-lowtech-website.html">low tech solutions</a> can we enable if we keep our communities intentionally small? This may open up more paths to equitable access by communities with different resources available to them.</p>
  <h3><a id="more-on-scale"></a>More on scale</h3>
  <p>Any time I propose a new piece of software to a group of software engineers I'm asked the same question: how will it scale? We are trained as a group to ask this question. I think it's the software equivalent of in manufacturing when someone asks "What will it cost to produce?" Since the marginal cost of producing software is effectively zero, it's the scale, the ability for the software to be used by millions or billions of people, that becomes the limiting factor that everyone brings up.</p>
  <p>Imagine two different software developers. One person writes a piece of software that makes the lives of one million people slightly easier. Maybe it's better routing for navigation software and it shaves 30 seconds off the commute of a million people. Another person writes a piece of software that only ten people ever use, but it tangibly changes their lives for the better in very material ways; maybe they learn a trade that becomes a career. </p>
  <p>One of these outcomes is not necessarily better than the other, and yet due to myriad factors, only the software with a million users is likely to get funding from entities—whether the context is for profit or not for profit. </p>
  <p>I'd like to advance the notion that software does not have to scale, and in fact software can be better if it is not built to scale. I hope some of the examples I've given above have illustrated what is possible when software is used by a small number of people instead of a large number of people.</p>
  <h3><a id="beyond-local-and-public:-the-neighborhood"></a>Beyond local and public: the neighborhood</h3>
  <p>Right now on federated social networks you have a concept of people on your own "home" server (which I'll call local) and people on every other server in the world (which I'll call public). But we need concepts that are more fine grained than local and public.</p>
  <p>I would like to see groups of servers that band together through a kind of mutual approval system. The group of people on Server A decide that Server B is to be trusted, and vice versa. They approve each other, in a manner similar to friending someone on Facebook, but for a whole server instead of an individual user. Now the 50 people on server A and the 50 people on server B are in a "neighborhood" together.</p>
  <p>Servers that belong to the same neighborhood could share things with each other. For example, the servers could share access to posts that are tagged on either server as "available to the neighborhood". Servers could share block lists, since mutual trust between servers probably implies some level of shared values between the people on both servers.</p>
  <p>A neighborhood would necessarily consist of two or more servers, and could in theory grow to be very large. </p>
  <p>However, I don't think neighborhoods should be very big themselves. I think there should be a kind of mutual decision-making, so perhaps now that A and B are connected, both A and B have to agree that C is worth connecting to, and C has to agree that A and B are worth it. This makes every extra node you add more difficult, which is the point. Big "private" communities should be very very hard to come by — and "public" should be where the "broad" conversations happen. </p>
  <p>I also think there shouldn't be concepts of overlapping Venn diagrams of multiple neighborhoods. I <em>loved</em> the concept from Google Plus of <a href="http://socialmediasun.com/google-plus-circles/">circles</a>. The idea was that as a person you have friends, coworkers, college friends, family, IRL neighbors, etc. People you "know" on Google Plus could belong to none, one, or more than one of these groups. A childhood friend who you also work with would probably belong to "friends", "childhood friends", and "coworkers". This system sounded <em>great</em> to me… until I tried it in practice. And in practice it was so much tedious digital paperwork to keep it all fresh and updated. I didn't want to manage people into one or more of dozens of categories and in the end I just went for the default "mutual friends on the social network" and "public" circles.</p>
  <p>I think many of us can hold three of these groups in our head though, especially if it's not the job of the individual user to constantly maintain it. I'm sure lots of people can hold more than three groups in their head at a time, but I'm picking the smallest useful number in order to reduce the confusion I experienced with Google's "circles" feature.</p>
  <p>So for me an ideal network would be partitioned into three basic levels for posting:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>local - just the people on my physical server</li>
  <li>neighborhood - the concept I described above of people who belong to servers that have a mutual trust agreement</li>
  <li>public - everyone in the world</li>
  
  </ul>
  <p>This would be in addition to the usual layers of "followers only" and that kind of thing.</p>
  <p>One way I see this breaking down is:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>local - tin foil hat stuff, "I do not want this message to leave this piece of metal", or perhaps the <em>very</em> intimate like "only local mutual followers get to see my nudes"</li>
  <li>neighborhood - most of your friendly chatter and ideological debate happens here</li>
  <li>public - the place for things that are inconsequential (cute cats and jokes), or require signal boosting, or where you really want to put an idea in front of the public</li>
  </ul>
</section>

  <h2><a id="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>There are a lot of unanswered questions here, and in a lot of ways I am still learning as I go. I don't want to give the impression that I have the answer to everything so I'd like to address some questions that I don't have good anwers to at all.</p>
  <h3><a id="hard-questions"></a>Hard questions</h3>
  <p><strong>How do people join one of these networks if they don't have friends who are already on such a network?</strong> This may be where sites with thousands of users come into play. Perhaps people join a giant server but then do it with the understanding that they are there to make friends on smaller servers with the idea of eventually moving there or even starting their own server. This is not very feasible until the account migration stuff I mention in the <a href="#what-we-need-to-do-in-the-future">"What we need to do in the future"</a> section is solved.</p>
  <p><strong>What happens to people who suck?</strong> Like what about people who are actively opposed to community cohesion? Will they find a sort of anti-community where they are accepted? Will they simply migrate to the giant networks of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people? Will they set up their own single-person networks? Will this kind of network even be the place for them at all? I don't know.</p>
  <p><strong>What about equity?</strong> For example, how do we get these servers run and operated by people in poor communities? I look to work by people like <a href="https://twitter.com/_brunaz_">Bruna Zanolli</a>, going in to Amazon indigenous communities and training the women to run the networks. If you have the privilege to run one of these sites then you might also have the ability to teach people how to run them for themselves. If that's you, then it's really your duty to get other people up and running. The more communities you help get started, the more options your own community will have for people to connect to. I also would love to see granting organizations support this kind of work.</p>
  <p><strong>Do the technical administrators have to be the same people doing the social organizing?</strong> I think the answer as of June 2019 is, sadly, yes. If you have 2 people with root access to the server and 2 people managing the community aspects, you'll end up with imbalances in that group of 4. You will end up with technical administrators who feel like code monkeys who never get the gratitude that the community organizers get, or you'll end up with community organizers who feel like glorified babysitters while the techies have all the real power. You might even end up with a situation where both are true. I think that if you're dedicated to this sort of project though, you could start with something like that 2 and 2, and then the techies could teach the organizers the technical skills, and the organizers could teach the techies the organizing skills.</p>
  <p>However, if more paid hosting services would support a wider variety of software and forks and features, this reliance on technical people like me will hopefully become lessened and an actual community organizer, or some kind of community organization structure, can be in charge.</p>

  <p>Keep in mind that <strong>none of these services support any of the "future" concepts like neighborhoods</strong>. Some of the forks like <a href="https://glitch-soc.github.io/docs/">Glitch Social</a> do allow for local-only posting.</p>
  <h4><a id="if-learning-the-tech-stuff-is-realistically-not-going-to-happen"></a>If learning the tech stuff is realistically not going to happen</h4>
  <p>Do you have any technical friends? If you do, ask them if they might be willing to do this sort of thing.</p>
  <div>
    <p>You can also pay a company like <a href="https://masto.host/">Masto.host</a> to run all the technical stuff for you. If you take my advice and <a href="#keep-it-small">only have a small number of users</a>, then you can probably get away with paying less than $10/month for your hosting. Paying a company necessarily means that you have less control over your system. You won't be able to provide custom features for your users, but if you are not a technical person you probably aren't going to be writing custom features anyway.</p>

  <p>I suppose I'll repeat what I said multiple times in this document, which is that running a small social network site for your friends is hard work, but it's worth it. It is first and foremost the work of community building, and only secondarily is it a technical endeavor. And it's completely possible to do, today, though depending on who you are and what your resources are it's going to be difficult in different ways.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Email addresses are not good 'permanent' identifiers for accounts</h2>

	<p><small>December 30, 2023</small></p>
</div><div><p>Every so often someone needs to create a more or less permanent
internal identifier in their system every person's account. Some
of the time they look at how <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/OIDCThreeEmailAddresses">authentication systems like OIDC
return email addresses among other data</a> and decide that since pretty
much everyone is giving them an email address, they'll use the email
address as the account's permanent internal identification.
As <a href="http://regex.info/blog/2006-09-15/247">the famous saying</a> goes,
now you have two problems.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with email addresses as 'permanent' identifiers
is that people's email addresses change even within a single
organization (for example, <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/">a university</a>).
They change for the same collection of reasons that people's
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/FullLegalNamesProblems">commonly used names</a> and <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/LoginsDoChange">logins change</a>. An organization that refuses to change
or redo the email addresses it assigns to people is being unusually
cruel in ways that are probably not legally sustainable in any
number of places.</p>

<p>(Some of the time there will be some sort of access or forwarding
from the old email address to the new one, but even then the old
email address may no longer work for non-email purposes such as
OIDC authentication. And beyond that, the person won't want to keep
using their old and possibly uncomfortable email address with you,
they want to use their new current one.)</p>

<p>The lesser problem is that you have no particular guarantee that
an organization won't reuse email addresses, either in general or
for particularly desirable ones that get reused or reassigned as
an exception because someone powerful wants them. Sometimes you
sort of have no choice, because account recovery has to run through
the email address you have on file, but at other times (such as in
theory with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID#OpenID_Connect_(OIDC)">OIDC</a>), you
have some form of internal ID that is supposed to be unique and
permanent, which you should use.</p>

<p>Even if you have to remember an email address for account recovery,
<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/PowerOfMeaninglessIDs">you want your internal identifier for accounts to be meaningless</a>. This will make your life much simpler in
the long run, even if this is never exposed to people.</p>

<p>(There are also security issues lurking in the underbrush of reading
too much into email addresses, <a href="https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/google-oauth-is-broken-sort-of/">cf</a> (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38720544">via</a>).)</p>
