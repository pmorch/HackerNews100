        <p>Thanks to war, geopolitics, and climate change, Europe will have more
frequent and more severe <a href="https://nltimes.nl/2025/05/09/russia-preparing-war-europe-dutch-pm-activities-finnish-border">internet
disruptions</a>
in the very near future. Governments and businesses need to prepare
for catastrophic loss of communications. Unfortunately, the necessary
changes are risky and expensive, which means they won’t do it until a
<a href="https://layeraleph.com/">crisis</a> is already here. However, small
groups of volunteers with a little bit of time and money can provide
crucial initial leadership to bootstrap recovery.</p>
<p>An Internet Resiliency Club is a group of internet experts who can
communicate with each other across a few kilometers without any
centralized infrastructure using cheap, low-power, unlicensed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa">LoRa</a> radios and open source
<a href="https://meshtastic.org/">Meshtastic</a> text messaging software. These
volunteer groups can use their radios, technical skills, and personal
connections with other experts to restore internet connectivity.</p>
<p>This page is a quick-start guide to forming your own Internet
Resiliency Club. You can also join a <a href="https://lists.bowshock.nl/mailman/listinfo/irc">mailing
list</a> for general
questions and discussion about internet resiliency clubs:</p>

<p>I am <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/valerieaurora/">Valerie Aurora</a>, a
systems software engineer with 25 years of experience in open source
software, operating systems, networking, file systems, and volunteer
organizing. When I moved from San Francisco to Amsterdam in 2023, I
started looking for ways to give back to my new home. In addition to
systems consulting, I am a special rapporteur for the EU’s Cyber
Resilience Act, serve as a RIPE Meeting program committee member, and
speak at European technical conferences.</p>
<h2 id="why-internet-resiliency-club">Why Internet Resiliency Club?</h2>
<p>One of my nightmares is waking up one morning and discovering that the
power is out, the internet is down, my cell phone doesn’t work, and
when I turn on the emergency radio (if you have one), all you hear is
“Swan Lake” on repeat.</p>
<p>As a recent immigrant to Amsterdam, I began to realize that this
nightmare was increasingly likely. Russia regularly knocks out
communications and power in Ukraine, using both bombs and hackers. In
2022, German windmills were disabled by malware aimed at Ukraine.
Dubious tankers continue to “accidentally” drag their anchors and cut
undersea cables in the Baltic. The head of NATO advised everyone to
keep three days of supplies at home.</p>
<h2 id="ukraines-advice-on-network-resilience">Ukraine’s advice on network resilience</h2>
<p>What made me finally take action is watching a video created by
<a href="https://1-ix.net/en/poslugy-en-translation/ua-exchange/">Ukrainian IXP
1-IX</a> to
teach other European countries what Ukrainian internet operators have
learned about hardening and repairing internet infrastructure leading
up to and following the 2022 Russian invasion. The practical realities
of keeping networks operating during war were sobering: building
camoflouged router rooms with 3 days of generator power, replacing
active fiber optic cable with passive, getting military service
exemptions for their personnel, etc.. You can watch the most recent
version, <a href="https://ripe90.ripe.net/archives/video/1582/">“Network Resilience: Experiences of survival and development
during the war in
Ukraine”</a>, a 30 minute
presentation at RIPE 90.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-dutch-government-doing-to-prepare">What is the Dutch government doing to prepare?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the government of the Netherlands is not following
Ukraine’s lead. <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/cyber-security-pre-war-reality-check/">Bert Hubert’s blog post</a>
describes the Netherlands’ cloud-based “emergency communications”
system, which will definitely not work in any emergency that affects
power or internet connectivity.</p>
<p>I have asked many Dutch network operators if there is any official
plan for the communications equivalent of a “black start” of the
electrical grid. If there is one, it isn’t being shared with the
people who will have to implement it.</p>
<h2 id="crisis-engineering-to-the-rescue">Crisis engineering to the rescue</h2>
<p>The final piece of the idea came from a class I took on <a href="https://layeraleph.com/event/">Crisis
Engineering</a> from Layer Aleph, on how
organizations facing an existential crisis either swiftly transform
themselves into a more functional form, or they fail and become even
more dysfunctional. Our class’s first question was, “How do you
convince an organization that a crisis is coming and they need to
prepare for it?”</p>
<p>Their answer was both depressing and freeing: “You can’t. All you can
do is be prepared with tools and a plan for when the crisis arrives.
That’s when the organization will listen.”</p>
<h2 id="what-can-i-do-personally">What can I do personally?</h2>
<p>I started thinking about what I could personally do without any help
from government or businesses. What if I could organize a group of
volunteer networking experts who could communicate without any
centralized infrastructure? We could effectively bootstrap
communications recovery with just a few volunteers and some cheap
hardware.</p>
<h2 id="ham-radio-is-too-expensive-difficult-and-power-hungry">Ham radio is too expensive, difficult, and power-hungry</h2>
<p>Initially I looked into ham radio, but it is just too expensive,
difficult, and power-hungry to be practical. Then Alexander Yurtchenko
told me about LoRa (Long Range) radio and Meshtastic, a cheap,
low-power method of sending text messages across a few kilometers.</p>
<p>After a few months of part-time research and organizing, the Amsterdam
Internet Resiliency Club was born. This page exists to make it easier
for other people to start Internet Resiliency Clubs in their area.</p>
<h2 id="we-need-volunteer-internet-resiliency-organizations">We need volunteer internet resiliency organizations</h2>
<p>The evidence that Internet Resiliency Clubs are necessary keeps
growing. Since I started this project, the city of Amsterdam announced
that it is planning for three weeks without electricity. Spain and
Portugal lost power for most of a day. The U.S. re-elected Donald
Trump, who may at some point realize that he can hold Europe hostage
by threatening to cut off access to U.S.-owned internet services like
AWS and Microsoft Exchange. Simultaneously, large parts of Dutch
government are migrating to email hosted by Microsoft, and major Dutch
technology firms continue to migrate to AWS and Microsoft Azure.</p>
<p>If you and I don’t do this, dear reader, no one will.</p>
<h2 id="short-version">Short version</h2>
<p>How to form an Internet Resiliency Club:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collect a group of internet-y people within ~10 km of each other</li>
<li>Decide how to communicate normally (Signal, Matrix, email, etc.)</li>
<li>Buy everyone LoRa (Long Range) radios and a powerbank with trickle charge</li>
<li>Install Meshtastic on the LoRa radios</li>
<li>Choose a LoRa channel to communicate on</li>
<li>Organize meetups, send messages over Meshtastic, have fun</li>
</ul>
<p>If you work for a internet infrastructure company, you can suggest
giving interested employees a LoRa radio, a mobile phone powerbank,
and maybe even a small solar panel for their personal use (perhaps as
part of an annual gift or bonus).</p>
<h2 id="lora">LoRa</h2>
<p>LoRa radios have several advantages for use in emergency
communications:</p>
<ul>
<li>no centralized infrastructure needed</li>
<li>no license needed</li>
<li>cheap (starting at ~€20)</li>
<li>low-power (&lt; 1W, can power with an ordinary mobile phone powerbank)</li>
<li>runs open source Meshtastic firmware</li>
<li>can send text messages across several line-of-sight hops (several kms)</li>
<li>can connect via Bluetooth or WiFi to phones/computers</li>
<li>many urban areas have a good Meshtastic network already</li>
</ul>
<p>Amateur ham radio can transmit at higher bandwidth for longer
distances, but requires extensive training, licensing, larger
antennas, and more power. Ideally, both would be available in an
emergency.</p>
<h2 id="lorameshtastic-basics">LoRa/Meshtastic basics</h2>
<p>With a LoRa radio running the Meshtastic firmware, anyone can send
text messages to anyone else with a Meshtastic node as long as it
takes three or fewer forwards from other Meshtastic nodes to get from
source to destination (usually around ~10 km but highly dependent on
local terrain and weather).</p>
<p>Specifically, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa">LoRa</a> is a
proprietary technique for sending low bit-rate radio messages (~1 - 25
kbps) using very low power (&lt; 1W), derived from chirp spread spectrum
techniques. <a href="https://meshtastic.org/">Meshtastic</a> is open source
firmware for LoRa radios that uses a flood-forward mesh protocol to
send message across up to three line-of-sight hops between LoRa nodes
running Meshtastic.</p>
<p>LoRa radios are for sale online. The cheapest versions are development
boards, intended for companies to use while building a product, often
without batteries, cases, or good antennas. To use them, you must
connect to them from a phone or computer, either over Bluetooth via
the Meshtastic app or over WiFi using a web browser. The more
expensive systems may include an enclosure, battery, solar panel,
larger screen, keyboard, etc. Some can be used without an additional
phone or computer.</p>
<h2 id="battery-power">Battery power</h2>
<p>LoRa radios use relatively little power, often in the range of 100 -
200 mA. A normal mobile phone power bank with a capacity of 10000 -
20000 mAh can power a LoRa radio approximately 2 - 8 days, depending
on chipset, time spent transmitting, whether WiFi or Bluetooth are in
use, etc. The powerbank should support “trickle charging”; without
this, many powerbanks will stop supplying power because the power draw
of many LoRa radios is so low that the powerbank thinks nothing is
connected and stops supplying power.</p>
<h2 id="solar-power">Solar power</h2>
<p>LoRa radios can be powered by directly plugging them into a small
solar panel with USB output, or by charging a battery used by the LoRa
radio. A small folding 800 cm^2 solar panel generating 15w with a
5W/500 mA max output is sufficient to power many LoRa radios. With
this small of a setup, you don’t need fuses, charge controllers,
buck/boost converters, or anything other than the solar panel and an
optional mobile phone power bank.</p>
<h2 id="which-lora-radio-to-buy">Which LoRa radio to buy</h2>
<p>LoRa radios are available in a huge range of capabilities and
features. For an Internet Resiliency Club, we recommend one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heltec V3: no case, no battery, WiFi/Bluetooth, OLED display, USB-C</li>
<li>LILYGO T-Echo: case, built-in battery, Bluetooth, e-ink display, USB-C</li>
</ul>
<p><em>IMPORTANT: Never turn on a LoRa device without an antenna attached!
The power sent to the antenna can destroy the device if there is no
antenna attached to radiate it.</em></p>
<p>Note: While many LoRa devices have USB-C ports, they often don’t
implement USB-C PD (Power Delivery) and won’t charge their battery
correctly on USB-C to USB-C cables. Use a USB-A to USB-C cable (often
supplied with the device).</p>
<h2 id="heltec-v3-series">Heltec V3 series</h2>
<p>If you have more time than money, try the latest Heltec V3, currently
one of the cheapest boards available at around €20. It has a
postage stamp-sized OLED screen, a couple of tiny buttons,
WiFi/Bluetooth, and USB-C input/power (but use a USB-A to USB-C
cable). Received messages are displayed on the OLED and can be cycled
through with tiny buttons. Sending messages requires connecting to it
via WiFi or Bluetooth.</p>
<p>It has no case, but the little plastic box it comes in can easily be
turned into one with a sharp pen knife. It also has no battery, but it
is a good idea to have a separate power bank anyway since you need a
working phone or computer to send messages. It has no GPS.</p>

<h2 id="lilygo-t-echo">LILYGO T-Echo</h2>
<p>If you have more money than time, I recommend the LILYGO T-Echo, a
simple small low-power ready-to-use handheld device for about
€80. It has ~3cm square e-ink display, a case with a few buttons,
Bluetooth, GPS, and about a day’s worth of battery.
Input/output/charging is via USB-C (but use a USB-A to USB-C cable).
Received messages are displayed on the e-ink screen and can be cycled
through with the buttons. Sending messages requires connecting with
another device via Bluetooth.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://meshtastic.org/docs/hardware/devices/lilygo/techo/">Meshtastic
page on this
board</a>
includes links to purchase from in Europe. I bought mine from
<a href="https://www.tinytronics.nl/en/development-boards/microcontroller-boards/with-gps/lilygo-ttgo-t-echo-nrf52840-lora-868mhz-bme280-gnss-black">TinyTronics</a>.</p>
<h2 id="lilygo-t-deck">LILYGO T-Deck</h2>
<p>If you want a standalone device that doesn’t require a separate phone
or computer to send messages, the <a href="https://www.tinytronics.nl/nl/development-boards/microcontroller-boards/met-lora/lilygo-t-deck-esp32-s3-toetsenbord-met-2.8-inch-ips-display-en-touchscreen-lora-868mhz-zwart">LILYGO
T-Deck</a>
includes a keyboard, trackball, and touch screen for about €70 -
80, depending on whether it includes a case and whether the antenna is
internal or external. It has about 8 hours of battery. I’m not a fan
because the screen and keyboard aren’t as good as the one on your
phone and take extra battery to run. It is often out of stock,
especially if you’re looking for a case and external antenna.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://meshtastic.org/docs/hardware/devices/lilygo/tdeck/">Meshtastic page on this
board</a>
includes links to purchase from in Europe.</p>
<h2 id="upgrading-the-antenna">Upgrading the antenna</h2>
<p>Most of the antennas that ship with evaluation boards are not very
good. One option for an upgrade if you’re using the recommended 868
MHz network is the <a href="https://eleshop.eu/868-mhz-antenne-met-sma-connector.html">Taoglas
TI.08.A</a>.</p>
<p><em>IMPORTANT: Never turn on a LoRa device without an antenna attached!
The power sent to the antenna can destroy the device if there is no
antenna attached to radiate it.</em></p>
<h2 id="flashing-installing-the-meshtastic-firmware">Flashing (installing) the Meshtastic firmware</h2>
<p>Some boards ship with Meshtastic already installed, but it’s
undoubtedly several months out of date. Flashing LoRa boards is
relatively easy; it can be as simple as using the <a href="https://meshtastic.org/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/esp32/">Meshtastic web
browser
flasher</a>
(requires Chrome or Edge) or dragging and dropping a file into a
mounted USB drive presented by the device. A command line tool using a
serial interface is also an option, but may require some fiddling with
a Python env.</p>

<p>In Europe, two frequencies are available for use by LoRa: <a href="https://meshtastic.org/docs/configuration/region-by-country/">868 MHz and
433
MHz</a>.
868 MHz is the <a href="https://meshtastic.org/docs/overview/radio-settings/">most popular for Meshtastic users in
Europe</a>. Several
modem presets are available; use the default mode <code>LONG_FAST</code> unless you
have a specific reason not to.</p>
<p>LoRa has
<a href="https://meshtastic.org/docs/configuration/radio/channels/">channels</a>,
a stream of messages using the same encryption key and channel name.
Each device is configured with a default primary channel shared by all
Meshtastic nodes. You can also configure secondary channels that can
only be accessed by nodes with the same key and channel name. Choose
an encryption key and channel name for a shared secondary channel. You
can share a QR code to configure a device with the appropriate
channels and settings.</p>
<h2 id="meetups-and-practice">Meetups and practice</h2>
<p>The best time to learn how to work together with a group of people is
before a crisis, not during it. Crisis engineering tells us that a
team is more likely to be successful if everyone has already worked
together.</p>
<p>Since this is a volunteer group, “working” together has to be fun.
Invite your group to do fun things together, changing up what activity
you are doing, where it is located, and what time it is held so that
a wide variety of people can participate.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>This study explores the neural and behavioral consequences of LLM-assisted essay writing. Participants were divided into three groups: LLM, Search Engine, and Brain-only (no tools). Each completed three sessions under the same condition. In a fourth session, LLM users were reassigned to Brain-only group (LLM-to-Brain), and Brain-only users were reassigned to LLM condition (Brain-to-LLM). A total of 54 participants took part in Sessions 1-3, with 18 completing session 4. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess cognitive load during essay writing, and analyzed essays using NLP, as well as scoring essays with the help from human teachers and an AI judge. Across groups, NERs, n-gram patterns, and topic ontology showed within-group homogeneity. EEG revealed significant differences in brain connectivity: Brain-only participants exhibited the strongest, most distributed networks; Search Engine users showed moderate engagement; and LLM users displayed the weakest connectivity. Cognitive activity scaled down in relation to external tool use. In session 4, LLM-to-Brain participants showed reduced alpha and beta connectivity, indicating under-engagement. Brain-to-LLM users exhibited higher memory recall and activation of occipito-parietal and prefrontal areas, similar to Search Engine users. Self-reported ownership of essays was the lowest in the LLM group and the highest in the Brain-only group. LLM users also struggled to accurately quote their own work. While LLMs offer immediate convenience, our findings highlight potential cognitive costs. Over four months, LLM users consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels. These results raise concerns about the long-term educational implications of LLM reliance and underscore the need for deeper inquiry into AI's role in learning.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>Isaac Newton was never entirely happy with his law of universal gravitation. For decades after publishing it in 1687, he sought to understand how, exactly, two objects were able to pull on each other from afar. He and others came up with several mechanical models, in which gravity was not a pull, but a push. For example, space might be filled with unseen particles that bombard the objects on all sides. The object on the left absorbs the particles coming from the left, the one on the right absorbs those coming from the right, and the net effect is to push them together.</p>
<p>Those theories never quite worked, and Albert Einstein eventually provided a deeper explanation of gravity as a distortion of space and time. But Einstein’s account, called general relativity, <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-thought-experiments-that-fray-the-fabric-of-space-time-20240925/">created its own puzzles</a>, and he himself recognized that it could not be the final word. So the idea that gravity is a collective effect — not a fundamental force, but the outcome of swarm behavior on a finer scale — still compels physicists.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a team of theoretical physicists <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17575">put forward</a> what might be considered a modern version of those 17th-century mechanical models. “There’s some kind of gas or some thermal system out there that we can’t see directly,” said <a href="https://qquest.lbl.gov/~carney/">Daniel Carney</a> of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, who led the effort. “But it’s randomly interacting with masses in some way, such that on average you see all the normal gravity things that you know about: The Earth orbits the sun, and so forth.”</p>
<p>This project is one of the many ways that physicists have sought to understand gravity, and perhaps the bendy space-time continuum itself, as emergent from deeper, more microscopic physics. Carney’s line of thinking, known as entropic gravity, pegs that deeper physics as essentially just the physics of heat. It says gravity results from the same random jiggling and mixing up of particles — and the attendant rise of entropy, loosely defined as disorder — that governs steam boilers, car engines and refrigerators.</p>

<p>Attempts at modeling gravity as a consequence of rising entropy have cropped up now and again for several decades. Entropic gravity is very much a minority view. But it’s one that won’t die, and even detractors are loath to dismiss it altogether. The new model has the virtue of being experimentally testable — a rarity when it comes to theories about the mysterious underpinnings of the universal attraction.</p>
<h2><strong>A Force Emerges</strong></h2>
<p>What makes Einstein’s theory of gravity so remarkable is not just that it works (and does so with sublime mathematical beauty), but that it betrays its own incompleteness. General relativity predicts that stars can collapse to form black holes, and that, at the centers of these objects, gravity becomes infinitely strong. There, the space-time continuum tears open like an overloaded grocery bag, and the theory is unable to say what comes next. Furthermore, general relativity has uncanny parallels to heat physics, even though not a single thermal concept went into its development. It predicts that black holes only grow, never shrink, and only swallow, never disgorge. Such irreversibility is characteristic of the flow of heat. When heat flows, energy takes a more randomized or disordered form; once it does, it is unlikely to reorder itself spontaneously. Entropy quantifies this growth of disorder.</p>
<p>Indeed, when physicists used quantum mechanics to study what happens in the distorted space-time around a black hole, they find that black holes give off energy like any hot body. Because heat is the random motion of particles, these thermal effects suggest to many researchers that black holes, and the space-time continuum in general, actually consist of some kind of particles or other microscopic components.</p>

<p>Following the <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-1-clue-to-quantum-gravity-sits-on-the-surfaces-of-black-holes-20240925/">clues from black holes</a>, physicists have pursued multiple approaches to understanding how space-time emerges from more microscopic components. The leading approach takes off from what’s known as the holographic principle. It says the emergence of space-time works a bit like an ordinary hologram. Just as a hologram evokes a sense of depth from a wavy pattern etched onto a flat surface, patterns in the microscopic components of the universe may give rise to another spatial dimension. This new dimension is curved, so that gravity arises organically.</p>
<p>Entropic gravity, introduced in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9504004">a famous 1995 paper</a> by the theoretical physicist <a href="https://umdphysics.umd.edu/people/faculty/current/item/246-jacobson.html">Ted Jacobson</a> of the University of Maryland, takes a related but distinct tack. Previously, physicists had started with Einstein’s theory and derived its heatlike consequences. But Jacobson went the other way. He started from the assumption that space-time has thermal properties and used these to derive the equations of general relativity. His work confirmed that there’s something significant about the parallels between gravity and heat.</p>
<p>“He turned black hole thermodynamics on its head,” Carney said. “I’ve been mystified by this result for my entire adult life.”</p>
<h2><strong>Apparent Attraction</strong></h2>
<p>How might gravitational attraction arise out of more microscopic components? Inspired by Jacobson’s approach, Carney and his co-authors — <a href="https://profiles.lbl.gov/474580-manthos-karydas">Manthos Karydas</a>, Thilo Scharnhorst, Roshni Singh and <a href="https://www.umdphysics.umd.edu/people/faculty/adjunct-faculty/item/529-jmtaylor.html">Jacob Taylor</a> — put forward two models.</p>
<p>In the first, space is filled with a crystalline grid of quantum particles, or qubits. Each has an orientation, like a compass needle. These qubits will align themselves with a nearby object that possesses mass and exert a force on that object. “If you put a mass somewhere in the lattice, it causes all of the qubits nearby to get polarized — they all try to go in the same direction,” Carney said.</p>

    </figure>

<p>By reorienting the nearby qubits, a massive object creates a pocket of high order in the grid of otherwise randomly oriented qubits. If you place two masses into the lattice, you create two such pockets of order. High order means low entropy. But the system’s natural tendency is to maximize entropy. So, as the masses realign the qubits and the qubits in turn buffet the masses, the net effect will be to squash the masses closer together to contain the orderliness to a smaller region. It will appear that the two masses are attracting each other gravitationally when in fact the qubits are doing all the work. And just as Newton’s law dictates, the apparent attraction diminishes with the square of the distance between the masses.</p>
<p>The second model does away with the grid. Massive objects still reside within space and are acted upon by qubits, but now those qubits do not occupy any particular location and could in fact be far away. Carney said this feature is intended to capture the nonlocality of Newtonian gravity: Every object in the universe acts on every other object to some degree.</p>
<p>Each qubit in the model is able to store some energy; the amount depends on the distance between the masses. When they are far apart, a qubit’s energy capacity is high, so the total energy of the system can fit in just a few qubits. But if the masses are closer together, the energy capacity of each qubit drops, so the total energy has to be spread over more qubits. The latter situation corresponds to a higher entropy, so the natural tendency of the system is to push the masses together, again in keeping with Newtonian gravity.</p>
<h2><strong>Strengths and Weaknesses</strong></h2>
<p>Carney cautioned that both models are ad hoc. There’s no independent evidence for these qubits, and he and his colleagues had to fine-tune the strength and direction of the force exerted by them. One might ask whether this is any improvement over taking gravity to be fundamental. “It actually seems to require a peculiar engineered-looking interaction to get this to work,” Carney said.</p>
<p>And what works is just Newton’s law of gravity, not the full apparatus of Einstein’s theory, where gravity is equivalent to the curvature of space-time. For Carney, the models are just a proof of principle — a demonstration that it is at least possible for swarm behavior to explain gravitational attraction — rather than a realistic model for how the universe works. “The ontology of all of this is nebulous,” he said.</p>
<p><a href="https://phas.ubc.ca/~mav/vanraamsdonk.html">Mark Van Raamsdonk</a>, a physicist at the University of British Columbia, is doubtful that the models really represent a proof of principle. A practitioner of holography, the leading approach to emergent space-time, Van Raamsdonk notes that the new entropic models don’t have any of the qualities that make gravity special, such as the fact that you feel no gravitational force when you’re freely falling through space-time. “Their construction doesn’t really have anything to do with gravity,” he said.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the models dwell on the one aspect of gravity that physicists think they already understand. Newton’s law arises naturally out of Einstein’s theory when gravity is comparatively feeble, as it is on Earth. It’s where gravity gets strong, as in black holes, that it gets weird, and the entropic model has nothing to say about that. “The real challenge in gravitational physics is understanding its strong-coupling, strong-field regime,” said <a href="https://sites.physics.bgu.ac.il/ramyb/">Ramy Brustein</a>, a theorist at Ben-Gurion University who said he used to be sympathetic to entropic gravity but has cooled on the idea.</p>
<p>Proponents of entropic gravity respond that physicists shouldn’t be so sure about how gravity behaves when it is weak. If gravity is indeed a collective effect of qubits, the Newtonian force law represents a statistical average, and the moment-by-moment effect will bounce around that average. “You have to go to very weak fields, because then these fluctuations might become observable,” said <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/v/e/e.p.verlinde/e.p.verlinde.html?cb">Erik Verlinde</a> of the University of Amsterdam, who argued for entropic gravity in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0785">much-discussed 2010 paper</a> and has continued to develop the idea.</p>
<h2><strong>Testing Entropic Gravity</strong></h2>
<p>Carney thinks the main benefit of the new models is that they prompt conceptual questions about gravity and open up new experimental directions.</p>
<p>Suppose a massive body is in a quantum combination, or “superposition,” of being in two different locations. Will its gravitational field likewise be in a superposition, pulling on falling bodies in two different directions? The new entropic-gravity models predict that the qubits will act on the massive body to snap it out of its Schrödinger’s cat–like predicament.</p>
        
        
<p>This scenario connects to the much-fretted-over question of wave function collapse — which asks how it is that measuring a quantum system in superposition causes its multiple possible states to become a single definite state. Some physicists have suggested that this collapse is caused by some intrinsic randomness in the universe. These proposals differ in detail from Carney’s but have similar testable consequences. They predict that an isolated quantum system will eventually collapse of its own accord, even if it’s never measured or otherwise affected from without. “The same experimental setups could, in principle, be used to test both,” said <a href="https://www.qmts.it/team/angelo-bassi/">Angelo Bassi</a> of the University of Trieste, who has led the effort to perform such experiments, already <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/physics-experiments-spell-doom-for-quantum-collapse-theory-20221020/">ruling out some collapse models</a>.</p>
<p>For all his doubts, Van Raamsdonk agrees that the entropic-gravity approach is worth a try. “Since it hasn’t been established that actual gravity in our universe arises holographically, it’s certainly valuable to explore other mechanisms by which gravity might arise,” he said. And if this long-shot theory does work out, physicists will need to update the artist Gerry Mooney’s famous gravity poster, which reads: “Gravity. It isn’t just a good idea. It’s the law.” Perhaps gravity is not, in fact, a law, just a statistical tendency.</p>

<p>Previously I have covered a relatively obscure now-removed placeholder string in Android that doubles as an easter egg, the fictitious carrier by the name of <a href="https://voxelmanip.se/2024/10/14/el-telco-loco/">El Telco Loco</a>. But this time it is about methods and other parts of the publicly facing Android API that may generally be more humourous than they are useful. Easter eggs, jokes, whatever you want to call them, that are visible to Android app developers rather than regular users.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="activitymanagerisuseramonkey">ActivityManager.isUserAMonkey()</h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ActivityManager#isUserAMonkey()">(reference)</a></p>

<p>While it may initially look like a joke when it’s described as returning true if the UI is “currently being messed with by a monkey” without any further elaboration in the documentation, this is probably the one in the list with the most usefulness attached to it.</p>

<p>It is referring to the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/test/other-testing-tools/monkey">UI Exerciser Monkey</a>, which is a developer tool for Android that simulates random sequences of user input in order to stress-test apps. So this method will return a boolean of whether the Monkey is currently running or not.</p>

<p>The introduction of such a method to detect the usage of the Monkey appears to have an origin in something that happened during Android’s development, as per a quote from the book <em><a href="https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Chet_Haase_Androids">Androids: The Team that Built the Android Operating System</a></em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One day I walked into the monkey lab to hear a voice say, ‘911 -What’s your emergency?” That situation resulted in Dianne adding a new function to the API, <code>isUserAMonkey()</code> which is used to gate actions that monkeys shouldn’t take during tests (including dialing the phone and resetting the device).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, when feeding random and inherently unpredictable input into an app, you would want to have some way of locking away portions of an app that may have unintended real-world consequences such as calling emergency services. As such, <code>isUserAMonkey</code> was implemented and later made its way into the public API in Android 2.2 Froyo (API 8).</p>

<h2 id="usermanagerisuseragoat">UserManager.isUserAGoat()</h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/UserManager.html#isUserAGoat()">(reference)</a></p>

<p>This one is more of a joke. The developer documentation says it is “used to determine whether the user making this call is subject to teleportations”, which in itself is likely a reference to a hidden column in the Chrome task manager that shows how many goats a browser process has teleported.</p>

<p>It was first introduced in Android 4.2 (API 17), and originally just returned false. However in Android 5.0 Lollipop (API 21) it was changed to “automatically identify goats using advanced goat recognition technology”. The game Goat Simulator had released earlier that year and was made available for Android in September during Lollipop’s development, so this method was changed to instead detect the presence of the Android version of Goat Simulator being installed on the device:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>boolean</span> <span>isUserAGoat</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>mContext</span><span>.</span><span>getPackageManager</span><span>()</span>
		<span>.</span><span>isPackageAvailable</span><span>(</span><span>"com.coffeestainstudios.goatsimulator"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Later in Android 11 (API 30), it was changed such that apps targetting API 30 and above will once again always return false when the method is called. According to the developer documentation this was made to “protect goat privacy”.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>mContext</span><span>.</span><span>getApplicationInfo</span><span>().</span><span>targetSdkVersion</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>Build</span><span>.</span><span>VERSION_CODES</span><span>.</span><span>R</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Android 11 is also the version where the <code>QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES</code> permission was introduced, meaning that apps targetting Android 11 would not be able to query for information of other apps through the <code>PackageManager</code> without this permission. So it makes sense to also wall off this method in order to not leak any information about other apps installed on an user’s device, even as a joke.</p>

<h2 id="usermanagerdisallow_fun">UserManager.DISALLOW_FUN</h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/UserManager.html#DISALLOW_FUN">(reference)</a></p>

<p>This constant refers to a device policy added in Android 6 Marshmallow (API 23) which restricts the user from having “fun”. The description given in the developer documentation is, ironically, amusing and reminds me of something GLaDOS would probably say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Specifies if the user is not allowed to have fun. In some cases, the device owner may wish to prevent the user from experiencing amusement or joy while using the device.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is in fact a real device policy that a device owner may change to restrict what users of the device is able to do with it. And third-parties can then hook into this to disable features of their app that are deemed “too fun”. I don’t know if any third-party apps actually make use of it, but in the Android system it is used to disable the Android version easter egg that shows up when pressing the version label in the settings.</p>

<p>Considering that “fun” easter eggs like the Google Chrome “No internet” Dinosaur minigame end up being distractions that e.g. schools want to disable for enrolled devices (<a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/41159706">see Chromium issue #41159706</a>), maybe the Android version easter egg could very much be a distraction depending on the version.</p>

<h2 id="chronometeristhefinalcountdown">Chronometer.isTheFinalCountdown()</h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Chronometer#isTheFinalCountDown()">(reference)</a></p>

<p>The <code>Chronometer</code> class had a new method by the name of <code>isTheFinalCountdown</code> added to it in Android 8 Oreo (API 26). When called, it will send an Intent to open the YouTube video for <em>The Final Countdown</em> by Europe.</p>

<p>No really. That’s what it does:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>try</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>getContext</span><span>().</span><span>startActivity</span><span>(</span>
		<span>new</span> <span>Intent</span><span>(</span><span>Intent</span><span>.</span><span>ACTION_VIEW</span><span>,</span> <span>Uri</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>"https://youtu.be/9jK-NcRmVcw"</span><span>))</span>
			<span>.</span><span>addCategory</span><span>(</span><span>Intent</span><span>.</span><span>CATEGORY_BROWSABLE</span><span>)</span>
			<span>.</span><span>addFlags</span><span>(</span><span>Intent</span><span>.</span><span>FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_DOCUMENT</span>
				<span>|</span> <span>Intent</span><span>.</span><span>FLAG_ACTIVITY_LAUNCH_ADJACENT</span><span>));</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>catch</span> <span>(</span><span>Exception</span> <span>e</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Marvelous.</p>

<h2 id="packagemanagerfeature_touchscreen_multitouch_jazzhand">PackageManager.FEATURE_TOUCHSCREEN_MULTITOUCH_JAZZHAND</h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager.html#FEATURE_TOUCHSCREEN_MULTITOUCH_JAZZHAND">(reference)</a></p>

<p>This constant was added in Android 2.3 Gingerbread (API 8) and is used to describe a device that supports tracking 5 simultaneous touch inputs, with the name being a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_hands">Jazz hands</a>.</p>

<h2 id="logwtf">Log.wtf()</h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Log.html#wtf(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String,%20java.lang.Throwable)">(reference)</a></p>

<p>According to the developer documentation, WTF stands for “What a Terrible Failure” (sure…), and is intended to log things that should <em>never</em> happen. It logs the message at the assertion level.</p>

<h2 id="adapterviewflipperfyiwillbeadvancedbyhostkthx">AdapterViewFlipper.fyiWillBeAdvancedByHostKThx()</h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/AdapterViewFlipper.html#fyiWillBeAdvancedByHostKThx()">(reference)</a></p>

<p>This is a method with an oddly humourous informal name, which was likely caused by some developer coming up blank on naming it and has now ended up in the public Android API, being added in Android 3.0 Honeycomb (API 11). It gets called by an <code>AppWidgetHost</code> when advancing the views inside of the <code>AdapterViewFlipper</code> object.</p>

<p>Indeed, naming things is one of the two hard problems in computer science, the other being off-by-one errors and cache invalidation.</p>

<h2 id="ibindertweet_transaction">IBinder.TWEET_TRANSACTION</h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/IBinder.html#TWEET_TRANSACTION">(reference)</a></p>

<p>The Android Binder system is used for performing IPC and transactions are distinguished using different types, one of them being… <code>TWEET_TRANSACTION</code>. It was added in Android 3.2 Honeycomb (API 13) and claims to be used to send a tweet to a target object.</p>

<p>It does not actually do anything, let alone send a tweet. The document mentions that messages have a limit of 130 characters, referencing Twitter’s old message character limit.</p>

<h2 id="ibinderlike_transaction">IBinder.LIKE_TRANSACTION</h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/IBinder.html#LIKE_TRANSACTION">(reference)</a></p>

<p>In a similar fashion, a new transaction type by the name of <code>LIKE_TRANSACTION</code> was added in Android 4.0.3 ICS (API 15). It’s used to tell an app that the caller likes it, there is no counter to keep track of the amount of likes but it is claimed that sending such transactions will improve the app’s self-esteem.</p>

<h2 id="sensormanagersensor_tricorder">SensorManager.SENSOR_TRICORDER</h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/SensorManager.html#SENSOR_TRICORDER">(reference)</a></p>

<p>I do have to admit I didn’t know what a Tricorder is, but it appears to be a fictional device from Star Trek and the constant was “added” in Android 1.0 (meaning it likely was present since before Android’s first official release).</p>

<p>The SENSOR_* constants in <code>SensorManager</code> have since then been deprecated in API level 15 in favour of the <code>Sensor</code> class, which does not include any equivalent reference to the Tricorder. Unfortunate.</p>

<h2 id="sensormanagergravity_">SensorManager.GRAVITY_*</h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/SensorManager.html#GRAVITY_DEATH_STAR_I">(reference)</a></p>

<p>The <code>SensorManager</code> class has a lot of constants which store the gravitational velocity of various bodies in our solar system ranging from <code>GRAVITY_SUN</code> to <code>GRAVITY_PLUTO</code>. While whether any of these outside of <code>GRAVITY_EARTH</code> is useful in any real-world scenarios is debatable, there are some that are actually just jokes.</p>

<p><code>GRAVITY_DEATH_STAR_I</code> stores the gravity of the first Death Star in SI units (referred to as Empire units). This appears to be a Star Wars reference.</p>

<p><code>GRAVITY_THE_ISLAND</code> stores the gravity of “the island”. Apparently this is a reference to The Island in the 2004 TV show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_(TV_series)">Lost</a>.</p>

<h2 id="blink">&lt;blink&gt;</h2>
<p>Last one, and this one is particularly crazy. Did you know there is a hidden tag inside the Android view layout system by the name of <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code>? Because that is a thing:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// [TAG_1995 = "blink"]</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>.</span><span>equals</span><span>(</span><span>TAG_1995</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>// Let's party like it's 1995!</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>BlinkLayout</span><span>(</span><span>context</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>It makes any children that is wrapped inside of it blink, like the old <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> HTML tag. This one appears to be completely undocumented in the Android Developer reference, but was added <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/9c1223a71397b565f38015c07cae57a5015a6500%5E%21">in a commit in 2011</a> with the title “Improve LayoutInflater’s compliance” (right…) and is still present in the AOSP master branch.</p>

<p>Whether you should actually use it is debatable however.</p>

<p>Though he died in 1995, the late TV painter remains an omnipresent cultural staple. His Chia Pet perm, nap-inducing voice, and meme-worthy sayings — “<em>Happy little trees!</em>” — have transcended time. On <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxcnsr1R5Ge_fbTu5ajt8DQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>, old episodes of his show, <em>The Joy of Painting</em>, boast ~<strong>450m views</strong>.</p>
<p>Online, you can acquire Bob Ross paints, Bob Ross brushes, Bob Ross underwear, Bob Ross coffee mugs, Bob Ross energy drinks, Bob Ross watches, and Bob Ross toasters.</p>
<p>But there’s one thing you won’t often see for sale: his artwork.</p>
<p>During his lifetime, Ross produced <strong>tens of thousands of paintings</strong>. Yet, only a handful of his works have popped up for sale in recent years. When they do appear, they often fetch <strong>$10k+ </strong>and attract dozens of bids.</p>
<p>Why is the work of one of history’s most prolific and accessible artists so scarce on the open market?</p>
<p>To find out, I spoke with art gallery owners, auctioneers, art collectors, ex-colleagues who worked with Ross, and the president of Bob Ross, Inc. — the company that preserves his legacy.</p>
<h4 id="h-the-man-behind-the-canvas"><strong>The man behind the canvas</strong></h4>
<p>Born in Daytona, Florida, in 1942, Ross dropped out of school in 9th grade to work with his father, a carpenter.</p>
<p>At 18, he joined the Air Force and moved to Alaska, where he’d spend the next 20 years as a drill sergeant, screaming at recruits. He was such a hard-ass that he earned the <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/19995/bust-em-bobby-bob-ross" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nickname</a> “Bust ’em up Bobby.”</p>
<p>But his life changed when he discovered art.</p>
<p>Inspired by the TV painter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Alexander_(painter)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill Alexander</a>, he started painting landscapes on gold mining pans and selling them at local markets in Alaska.</p>
<p>His income from painting soon surpassed what he made in the military. So, in 1981, he migrated back to Florida, trained under Alexander, and became a certified painting instructor.</p>

<p><em>Bob Ross strikes a happy pose (Photo: Acey Harper/The LIFE Images Collection via Getty Images)</em></p>
<p>Now, here’s where things took a wild turn for Ross:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of his students, <strong>Annette Kowalski</strong>, was “mesmerized” by the jolly painter and encouraged him to strike out on his own.</li>
<li>They pooled together their life savings, launched <strong>Bob Ross, Inc.</strong>, and set out to make Ross into a TV star.</li>
<li>A PBS executive gave them a shot.</li>
<li>The show — <em>The Joy of Painting</em>, which aired between 1983 and 1994<em> </em>— was a huge hit and was broadcast on <strong>~300 stations</strong> to <strong>80m+</strong> people every day.</li>
</ul>
<p>In each 27-minute episode, Ross would paint one landscape from start to finish, shepherding viewers through his process with a soothing disposition, entertaining commentary, and an occasional guest appearance by his <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/nothing-brought-more-joy-to-the-joy-of-paintings-bob-ross-than-squirrels/2020/04/15/e72c4ee0-7f2e-11ea-9040-68981f488eed_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pet squirrel</a>, Peapod.</p>
<p>Ross didn’t get paid for his shows. But Bob Ross, Inc. — which he partially owned — used the platform to sell paints, art supplies, workshops, instructional videos, and merchandise. By 1991, it was a <strong>$15m/year ($29m today) </strong>enterprise.</p>
<p>The actual paintings, though, were largely an afterthought.</p>
<p>Over the course of his career, Ross filmed <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-statistical-analysis-of-the-work-of-bob-ross/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">381 episodes</a> of <em>The Joy of Painting</em>. For each episode, he painted <strong>3 versions</strong> of the same artwork — one before, one during, and one after taping.</p>
<p>But his TV career only scratched the surface of his total output.</p>
<p>Pre-fame, in Alaska, he sold thousands of paintings. And even while famous, he painted nearly every day at seminars, events, and charity auctions in between tapings.</p>
<p>All told, Bob Ross <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1991/12/22/issue.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=LedeAsset&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">churned out</a> ~<strong>30k paintings</strong> in his lifetime — nearly 3x the output of Picasso, a prolific painter in his own right.</p>

<p><em>Zachary Crockett / The Hustle (painting © Bob Ross Inc.)</em></p>
<p>For years, collectors and fans have clamored to own their own piece of Bob Ross lore. Multiple art dealers told <em>The Hustle </em>that demand for his work is extraordinarily robust.</p>
<p>But Ross paintings are a bit like diamonds: vast in volume, scarce on the open market.</p>
<p>Major auction houses — Christie’s, Sotheby’s, Phillips — have no Bob Ross sales history. Craigslist draws a goose egg. A scan of eBay only turns up <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2334524.m570.l1313&amp;_nkw=bob+ross+painting&amp;_sacat=0&amp;LH_TitleDesc=0&amp;_fsrp=1&amp;_sop=16&amp;_odkw=bob+ross+original+painting&amp;_osacat=0&amp;LH_Sold=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3 sales</a> in the last 6 months, 2 of which are of dubious origin.</p>
<p>Where the heck are those 30k paintings?</p>
<h4 id="h-bob-ross-incorporated"><strong>Bob Ross, Incorporated</strong></h4>
<p>As a part of Ross’s agreement with Bob Ross, Inc., the paintings he created for TV were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_for_hire" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">work for hire</a>, meaning the company maintained ownership of his work.</p>
<p>When Ross died in 1995, Bob Ross, Inc. (and thus, the paintings) became the sole property of Annette Kowalski and her husband, Walt.</p>
<p>Today, <strong>1,165 </strong>Bob Ross originals — a trove worth millions of dollars — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/arts/100000005865824/bob-ross-paintings-mystery.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sit in cardboard boxes</a> inside the company’s nondescript office building in Herndon, Virginia.</p>
<p><strong>Joan Kowalski</strong>, Annette’s daughter, and the current president of Bob Ross, Inc., tells <em>The Hustle</em> that the company had never really given the paintings much thought.</p>
<p>“The paintings have always just sort of been here,” she says, with a chuckle. “We were sort of behind the times… it never occurred to us that anyone would want them.”</p>
<p>The company, which can be reached by dialing 1-800-BOB-ROSS, gets constant inquiries from folks about buying the paintings.</p>
<p>But they’re not for sale.</p>
<p>“Our only mission,” Kowalski says, “is to preserve the mythological wonderment that was Bob Ross.”</p>

<p>Part of the reason Bob Ross, Inc. isn’t interested in selling the paintings is that it has far more lucrative assets on hand — like Bob Ross’s IP.</p>
<p>The company holds <a href="https://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?Search_Arg=bob+ross%2C+inc.&amp;Search_Code=NALL&amp;PID=JM_BQChiUnKP0RLjvDwzN-1Z8DQhp9v&amp;SEQ=20210430171747&amp;CNT=25&amp;HIST=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">154 copyrights</a>, and numerous <a href="https://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=toc&amp;state=4805%3Ad0j3o4.1.1&amp;p_search=searchss&amp;p_L=50&amp;BackReference=&amp;p_plural=yes&amp;p_s_PARA1=&amp;p_tagrepl%7E%3A=PARA1%24LD&amp;expr=PARA1+AND+PARA2&amp;p_s_PARA2=bob+ross&amp;p_tagrepl%7E%3A=PARA2%24OW&amp;p_op_ALL=AND&amp;a_default=search&amp;a_search=Submit+Query&amp;a_search=Submit+Query" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trademarks</a> on Ross’s name and likeness, which they use to sell millions of dollars’ worth of Bob Ross-themed merchandise and instructional courses.</p>
<p>On occasion, Bob Ross, Inc. leases out a few paintings to galleries and exhibits around the country:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>54 paintings</strong> can be seen at <a href="https://www.bobrossartworkshop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Bob Ross Art Workshop &amp; Gallery</a> in New Smyrna, Florida.</li>
<li><strong>27 paintings</strong> are at Minnetrista’s <a href="https://www.minnetrista.net/bobrossexperience" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bob Ross Experience</a> in Muncie, Indiana.</li>
<li><strong>4 paintings</strong> are in the possession of the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington, DC.</li>
</ul>
<p>But this only answers a part of the mystery. What about all the other paintings Ross gave away or sold during his life?</p>
<h4 id="h-the-open-market"><strong>The open market</strong></h4>
<p>Jessica Jenkins, a VP at the Minnetrista exhibit, and a Bob Ross scholar, tells <em>The Hustle </em>that many more Ross paintings are actually hanging in living rooms across the US.</p>
<p>“He was always happy to donate his paintings to fundraisers, or sell his work at a reasonable price,” she says. “Many people who own one acquired it decades ago.”</p>
<p>For years, WIPB-TV — the PBS affiliate station in Muncie, Indiana, where Ross filmed most of his episodes — would auction off a Ross painting at its annual fundraising drive.</p>
<p>According to the town’s paper, <em>The Star Press</em>, these paintings were always “the most anticipated item,” overshadowing tickets to Cancun, diamond necklaces, rare Beanie Babies, and basketballs signed by Magic Johnson.</p>
<p>“We still have 4 of his paintings hanging here at the station,” says Lori Georgi, a director at WIPB. “People come from England just to see them.”</p>

<p><em>An old newspaper clipping advertises an auction for an original Bob Ross painting featuring “majestic snow-covered mountains, a tranquil lake surrounded by towering evergreens, and a beautiful sunset sky.” (The Star Press; Muncie, Indiana, 2000)</em></p>
<p>Before he became a TV star, Ross also sold thousands of his landscape paintings at flea markets, fairs, and malls, often for small sums of cash.</p>
<p>This is how Larry Walton, 82, of Crosslake, Minnesota, acquired his original Bob Ross.</p>
<p>Back in 1980, while working as a flight instructor in Alaska, he <a href="https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/entertainment/art/4684705-Minnesota-couple-learns-painting-bought-40-years-ago-is-Bob-Ross-original" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bought</a> a scene with mountains and blue northern lights from the then-unknown “peculiar artist” at an Anchorage fair for $60.</p>
<p>It spent years sitting in the garage until his son — an avid fan of Bob Ross YouTube videos — thought the signature in the corner looked familiar.</p>
<p>When the couple decided to sell it, they turned to <a href="https://modernartifact.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modern Artifact</a>, an art gallery and dealer in Minneapolis, Minnesota.</p>
<p>Ryan Nelson, the gallery’s owner, tells <em>The Hustle </em>that he’s been buying and flipping Bob Ross paintings for 10 years. To find sellers like Walton, he uses SEO tactics and places “wanted” ads in local newspapers near where Ross spent time.</p>
<p>“We buy and sell more of his paintings than any gallery on the planet,” he writes via email. “To retain that position, we offer more money to buy his paintings than most anyone is willing to risk.”</p>
<p>The Waltons sold the painting to the gallery for <strong>$10k</strong>; Nelson then flipped it on eBay for a small profit.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional art collectors, those who possess Bob Ross paintings tend to be ordinary folks who don’t know what they’re in possession of.</p>
<p>“Most families that have these paintings are not millionaires,” he says, “and the money is very impactful in their lives.”</p>

<p><em>An original Bob Ross painting up for sale on Modern Artifact’s website for $95k (Modern Artifact)</em></p>
<p>Modern Artifact has sold <a href="https://modernartifact.com/search?q=bob+ross" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at least 34</a> Bob Ross paintings over the years.</p>
<p>Nelson wouldn’t divulge the sale prices, but said it’s not uncommon for them to go well beyond $10k. On the site, he currently has a rare ocean scene <a href="https://modernartifact.com/products/bob-ross-original-episode-painted-season-24-we-buy-bob-ross-paintings?_pos=2&amp;_sid=0a6322c89&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">listed</a> for <strong>$94k</strong>.</p>
<p>It may seem odd that Bob Ross paintings fetch that much at market.</p>
<p>After all, Ross often produced a painting in less than 30 minutes (by contrast, it took da Vinci <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4 years</a> to complete the Mona Lisa), and his artwork was, by design, highly replicable.</p>
<p>But Nelson chalks the crazy prices up to a combination of basic economic principles and social capital.</p>
<p>“The bottom line is supply and demand: Bob Ross paintings are extremely tough to find, and more people want them than can have them,” he says. “They’re also the ideal conversation pieces, since they are almost universally recognizable.”</p>

<p><em>A few Bob Ross classics. TOP: Wilderness Way, The Joy of Painting, S31, E13.; BOTTOM: Northern Lights,The Joy of Painting, S8, E13. (both © Bob Ross Inc.)</em></p>
<p>Lindsey Bourret, managing director of the art appraisal site <a href="https://mearto.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mearto</a>, estimates that the fair market value of a Ross painting — the price it <em>should </em>sell for based on precedent — is <strong>$2k to $4k</strong>. But the pop culture element to his work boosts demand.</p>
<p>“I would personally categorize Ross’s work as a hybrid between fine art and entertainment memorabilia,” she says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some buyers are willing to pay a premium for that.</p>
<p>One collector who didn’t wish to be named out of concern for her privacy, owns an extensive cache of artwork, including several six-figure pieces. But she considers her Bob Ross original her “crown jewel.”“I’ve had more guests comment on my Bob than my Picasso,” she tells <em>The Hustle</em>. “It’s really all about the story.”</p>
<h4 id="h-it-s-all-about-the-process"><strong>It’s all about the process</strong></h4>
<p>Ultimately, the real reason there aren’t more Bob Ross paintings up for sale is that the artist never wanted them to be a commodity.</p>
<p>For Ross, the value was in the process, not the finished product.</p>
<p>“He was about as uninterested in the actual paintings as you could possibly be,” says Kowalski. “For him, it was the journey — he wanted to teach people. The paintings were just a means to do that.”</p>

<p dir="auto">Version 0.9.0</p>
<p dir="auto">Twin is text-based windowing environment with mouse support, window manager,
terminal emulator, networked clients and the ability to attach/detach
mode displays on-the-fly.</p>
<p dir="auto">It supports a variety of displays:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>plain text terminals: Linux console, twin's own terminal emulator,
and any termcap/ncurses compatible terminal;</li>
<li>X11, where it can be used as a multi-window xterm;</li>
<li>itself (you can display a twin on another twin);</li>
<li>twdisplay, a general network-transparent display client, used
to attach/detach more displays on-the-fly.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Currently, twin is tested on Linux (i386, x86_64, ARM, ARM64, PowerPC, Alpha, Sparc),
on Mac OS X (x86_64) and on FreeBSD (i386, x86_64).
I had yet no chance to seriously test it on other systems.</p>

<p dir="auto">then run as root</p>

<p dir="auto">on Linux, also remember to run as root:</p>

<p dir="auto">on FreeBSD instead, remember to run as root:</p>

<p dir="auto">To compile twin you need the following programs installed
on your system:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">a Bourne-shell or compatible (for example bash, dash, ash...)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">make (most variants are supported: GNU make, BSD make...)</p>

<li>
<p dir="auto">an ANSI C compiler (for example gcc or clang)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Note: it is STRONGLY recommended to install at least the following packages before compiling twin
(the exact names depend on the operating system or Linux distribution):</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>x11-dev      - may be named x11-devel, libx11-dev ...</li>
<li>xft-dev      - may be named xft-devel, libxft-dev ...</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://telephone-exchanges.org.uk/">https://telephone-exchanges.org.uk/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44284466">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="cz_75334"><p>For more than a century the telephone exchange has formed the backbone of our telecommunications system. A vast array of more than 5,500 mostly nondescript buildings sit unnoticed on city, town or village streets, and quietly link up more than 254 million kilometres of cables and wires – keeping people in the UK connected to each other and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Since the first telephone exchange was established in London in 1879 with just eight subscribers, these anonymous looking buildings have spread the length and breadth of the UK – from the smallest on the remote Shetland Isle of Papa Stour, with just 14 homes, to the largest in Oldham, Manchester, serving more than 45,000.</p>
<p>But the recent explosive growth in new digital fibre based services means the majority of these iconic communication hubs will soon route their last ever call.</p>
<p>The advent of tiny but powerful microprocessors and glass fibres, thinner than the width of a human hair, only need a tiny fraction of the space taken up by miles of copper wires and bulky racks of switching machinery to run the old copper based phone network or Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).</p>
<p>This seismic shift means that today we’re able to provide fibre broadband services to the entire country from just 1,000 ‘super digital exchanges’ or Openreach Handover Points (OHPs).</p>
<p>Sadly, this spells the beginning of the end for the remaining 4,600 exchanges used to support traditional copper based phone and broadband voice services. And these copper customers are dwindling fast as people migrate to faster more efficient fibre</p>
<p>Openreach is now consulting with its communication provider (CP) customers – like Sky, Vodafone, TalkTalk and BT, who use our network to connect their own customers – about how to close these ‘legacy’ exchanges over the next decade or so.</p>
<p>This will be a major undertaking with several million services to be migrated, and the importance of ensuring vulnerable customers and the UK’s Critical National Infrastructure providers are protected along the way.&nbsp; So we’re planning it in stages – with the first 103 exchanges to close by December 2030. These have some of the highest running costs so there’s a clear advantage in targeting them first.&nbsp; Most of the remaining 4,500 exchanges will likely follow in the early 2030s.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span>programming</span>
</h6>
</p><div>
<p>I am a huge fan of Richard Feyman’s famous quote:</p>
<p><strong>“What I cannot create, I do not understand”</strong></p>
<p>I think it’s brilliant, and it remains true across many fields (if you’re willing to be a little creative with the
definition of ‘create’). It is to this principle that I believe I owe everything I’m truly good at. Some will tell you
to avoid reinventing the wheel, but they’re wrong: you <em>should</em> build your own wheel, because it’ll teach you more about
how they work than reading a thousand books on them ever will.</p>
<p>In 2025, the beauty and craft of writing software is being eroded. AI is threatening to replace us (or, at least, the
most joyful aspects of our craft) and software development is being increasingly commodified, measured, packaged, and
industrialised. Software development needs more simple joy, and I’ve found that creating toy programs is a great way to
remember why I started working with computers again.</p>
<p>Further, I’ve been consistently surprised by just how often some arcane nugget of knowledge I’ve acquired when working
on a toy project has turned out to be immensely valuable in my day job, either by giving me a head-start on tracking
down a problem in a tool or library, or by recognising mistakes before they’re made. Understanding the constraints that
define the shape of software is vital for working with it, and there’s no better way to gain insight into those
constraints than by running into them head-first. You might even come up with some novel solutions!</p>
<h2 id="the-list">The list</h2>
<p>Here is a list of toy programs I’ve attempted over the past 15 years, rated by difficulty and time required. These
ratings are estimates and assume that you’re already comfortable with at least one-general purpose programming language
and that, like me, you tend to only have an hour or two per day free to write code. Also included are some suggested
resources.</p>
<p>The list isn’t exhaustive, and I’m deliberately only covering those I have personal experience with.</p>
<h3 id="regex-engine-difficulty--410-time--3-days">Regex engine (difficulty = 4/10, time = 3 days)</h3>
<p>A regex engine that can read a POSIX-style regex program and recognise strings that match it. Regex is simple yet
shockingly expressive, and writing a competent regex engine will teach you everything you need to know about using the
language too.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#Syntax">Wikipedia: Regex</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="x86-os-kernel-difficulty--710-time--1-month">x86 OS kernel (difficulty = 7/10, time = 1 month)</h3>
<p>A multiboot-compatible OS kernel with a simple CLI, keyboard/mouse driver, ANSI escape sequence support, memory manager,
scheduler, etc. Additional challenges include writing an in-memory filesystem, user mode and process isolation, loading
ELF executables, and supporting enough video hardware to render a GUI.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/">OS Dev Wiki</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="gameboynes-emulator-difficulty--610-time--2-weeks">GameBoy/NES emulator (difficulty = 6/10, time = 2 weeks)</h3>
<p>A crude emulator for the simplest GameBoy or NES games. The GB and the NES are classics, and both have relatively simple
instruction sets and peripheral hardware. Additional challenges include writing competent PPU (video) and PSG (audio)
implementations, along with dealing with some of the more exotic cartridge formats.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gbdev.io/">GB Dev</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Nesdev_Wiki">NES Dev Wiki</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="gameboy-advance-game-difficulty--310-time--1-week">GameBoy Advance game (difficulty = 3/10, time = 1 week)</h3>
<p>A sprite-based game (top-down or side-on platform). The GBA is a beautiful little console to write code for and there’s
an active and dedicated development community for the console. I truly believe that the GBA is one of the last game
consoles that can be fully and completely understood by a single developer, right down to instruction timings.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/toc.htm">Tonc</a></li>
<li><a href="https://problemkaputt.de/gbatek.htm">GBATEK</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="physics-engine-difficulty--510-time--1-week">Physics engine (difficulty = 5/10, time = 1 week)</h3>
<p>A 2D rigid body physics engine that implements Newtonian physics with support for rectangles, circles, etc. On the
simplest end, just spheres that push away from one-another is quite simple to implement. Things start to get complex
when you introduce more complex shapes, angular momentum, and the like. Additional challenges include making collision
resolution fast and scaleable, having complex interactions move toward a steady state over time, soft-body interactions,
etc.</p>
<h3 id="dynamic-interpreter-difficulty--410-time--3-days">Dynamic interpreter (difficulty = 4/10, time = 3 days)</h3>
<p>A tree-walking interpreter for a JavaScript-like language with basic flow control. There’s an unbounded list of extra
things to add to this one, but being able to write programs in my own language still gives me child-like elation. It
feels like a sort of techno-genesis: once you’ve got your own language, you can start building the universe within it.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">Crafting Interpreters</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="compiler-for-a-c-like-difficulty--810-time--3-months">Compiler for a C-like (difficulty = 8/10, time = 3 months)</h3>
<p>A compiler for a simply-typed C-like programming language with support for at least one target archtecture. Extra
challenges include implementing some of the most common optimisations (inlining, const folding, loop-invariant code
motion, etc.) and designing an intermediate representation (IR) that’s general enough to support multiple backends.</p>
<h3 id="text-editor-difficulty--510-time--3-weeks">Text editor (difficulty = 5/10, time = 3 weeks)</h3>
<p>This one has a lot of variability. At the blunt end, simply reading and writing a file can be done in a few lines of
Python. But building something that’s closer to a daily driver gets more complex. You could choose to implement the UI
using a toolkit like QT or GTK, but I personally favour an editor that works in the console. Properly handling unicode,
syntax highlighting, cursor movement, multi-buffer support, panes/windows, tabs, search/find functionality, LSP support,
etc. can all add between a week or a month to the project. But if you persist, you might join the elite company of those
developers who use an editor of their own creation.</p>
<h3 id="async-runtime-difficulty--610-time--1-week">Async runtime (difficulty = 6/10, time = 1 week)</h3>
<p>There’s a lot of language-specific variability as to what ‘async’ actually means. In Rust, at least, this means a
library that can ingest <code>impl Future</code> tasks and poll them concurrently until completion. Adding support for I/O waking
makes for a fun challenge.</p>
<h3 id="hash-map-difficulty--410-time--1-week">Hash map (difficulty = 4/10, time = 1 week)</h3>
<p>Hash maps (or sets/dictionaries, as a higher-level language might call them) are a programmer’s bread &amp; butter. And yet,
surprisingly few of us understand how they really work under the bonnet. There are a plethora of techniques to throw
into the mix too: closed or open addressing, tombstones, the robin hood rule, etc. You’ll gain an appreciation for when
and why they’re fast, and also when you should just use a vector + linear search.</p>
<h3 id="rasteriser--texture-mapper-difficulty--610-time--1-week">Rasteriser / texture-mapper (difficulty = 6/10, time = 1 week)</h3>
<p>Most of us have played with simple 3D graphics at some point, but how many of us truly understand how the graphics
pipeline works and, more to the point, how to fix it when it doesn’t work? Writing your own software rasteriser will
give you that knowledge, along with a new-found appreciation for the beauty of vector maths and half-spaces that have
applications across many other fields. Additional complexity involves properly implementing clipping, a Z-buffer, N-gon
rasterisation, perspective-correct texture-mapping, Phong or Gouraud shading, shadow-mapping, etc.</p>

<h3 id="sdf-rendering-difficulty--510-time--2-days">SDF Rendering (difficulty = 5/10, time = 2 days)</h3>
<p>Signed Distance Fields are a beautifully simple way to render 3D spaces defined through mathematics, and are perfectly
suited to demoscene shaders. With relatively little work you can build yourself a cute little visualisation or some
moving shapes like the graphics demos of the 80s. You’ll also gain an appreciation for shader languages and vector
maths.</p>

<h3 id="voxel-engine-difficulty--510-time--1-week">Voxel engine (difficulty = 5/10, time = 1 week)</h3>
<p>I doubt there are many reading this that haven’t played Minecraft. It’s surprisingly easy to build your own toy voxel
engine cut from a similar cloth, especially if you’ve gone some knowledge of 3D graphics or game development already.
The simplicity of a voxel engine, combined with the near-limitless creativity that can be expressed with them, never
ceases to fill me with joy. Additional complexity can be added by tackling textures, more complex procedural generation,
floodfill lighting, collisions, dynamic fluids, sending voxel data over the network, etc.</p>

<p>Writing interpreters is great fun. What’s more fun? <em>Faster interpreters</em>. If you keep pushing interpreters as far as
they can go without doing architecture-specific codegen (like AOT or JIT), you’ll eventually wind up (re)discovering
<em>threaded code</em>. It’s a beautiful way of weaving programs together out highly-optimised miniature programs, and a decent
implementation can even give an AOT compiler a run for its money in the performance department.</p>

<h3 id="your-own-gui-toolkit-difficulty--610-time--2-weeks">Your Own GUI Toolkit (difficulty = 6/10, time = 2 weeks)</h3>
<p>Most of us have probably cobbled together a GUI program using tkinter, GTK, QT, or WinForms. But why not try writing
your GUI toolkit? Additional complexity involves implementing a competent layout engine, good text shaping (inc.
unicode support), accessibility support, and more. Fair warning: do not encourage people to use your tool unless it’s
<em>battle-tested</em> - the world has enough GUIs with little-to-no accessibility or localisation support.</p>
<h3 id="orbital-mechanics-sim-difficulty--1010-time--4-days">Orbital Mechanics Sim (difficulty = 10/10, time = 4 days)</h3>
<p>A simple simulation of Newtonian gravity can be cobbled together in a fairly short time. Infamously, gravitational
systems with more than three bodies cannot be solved analytically, so you’ll have to get familiar with iterative
<em>integration</em> methods. Additional complexity comes with implementing more precise and faster integration methods,
accounting for relativistic effects, and plugging in real numbers from NASA to predict the next high tide or full moon.</p>
<h3 id="bitwise-challenge-difficulty--310-time--1-day">Bitwise Challenge (difficulty = 3/10, time = 1 day)</h3>
<p>Here’s the challenge: write a game that only persists 64 bits of state between subsequent frames. That’s 64 bits for
everything: the entire frame-for-frame game state should be reproducible using only 64 bits of data. It sounds simple,
but it forces you to get incredibly creative with your game state management. More details about the rules on the GitHub
page below.</p>

<h3 id="an-ecs-framework-difficulty--410-time--1-week">An ECS Framework (difficulty = 4/10, time = 1 week)</h3>
<p>For all those game devs out there: try building your own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system">ECS</a>
framework. It’s not as hard as you might think (you might have accidentally done it already!). Extra points if you can
build in safety and correctness features, as well as good integration with your programming language of choice’s type
system features.</p>
<h3 id="chip-8-emulator-difficulty--310-time--3-days">CHIP-8 Emulator (difficulty = 3/10, time = 3 days)</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8">CHIP-8</a> is a beautifully simple virtual machine from the 70s. You can write
a fully compliant emulator in a day or two, and there are an enormous plethora of fan-made games that run on it.

<h3 id="chess-engine-difficulty--510-time--2-days">Chess engine (difficulty = 5/10, time = 2 days)</h3>
<p>Writing a chess engine is great fun. You’ll start off with every move it makes being illegal, but over time it’ll get
smart and smarter. Experiencing a loss to your own chess engine really is a rite of passage, and it feels magical.</p>
<h3 id="posix-shell-difficulty--410-time--3-days">POSIX shell (difficulty = 4/10, time = 3 days)</h3>
<p>We interact with shells every day, and building one will teach you can incredible amount about POSIX - how it works, and
how it doesn’t. A simple one can be built in a day, but compliance with an existing shell language will take time and
teach you more than you ever wanted to know about its quirks.</p>
<h2 id="a-note-on-learning-and-llms">A note on learning and LLMs</h2>
<p>Perhaps you’re a user of LLMs. I get it, they’re neat tools. They’re useful for certain kinds of learning. But I might
suggest resisting the temptation to use them for projects like this. Knowledge is not supposed to be fed to you on a
plate. If you want that sort of learning, read a book - the joy in building toy projects like this comes from an
exploration of the unknown, without polluting one’s mind with an existing solution. If you’ve been using LLMs for a
while, this cold-turkey approach might even be painful at first, but persist. There is no joy without pain.</p>
<p>The runner’s high doesn’t come to those that take the bus.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post">
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader">SumatraPDF</a> is a Windows GUI application for viewing PDF, ePub and comic books written in C++.</p>

<p>A common need in GUI programs is a callback. E.g. when a button is clicked we need to call a function with some data identifying which button was clicked. Callback is therefore a combo of function and data and we need to call the function with data as an argument.</p>

<p>In programming language lingo, code + data combo is called a closure.</p>

<p>C++ has <code>std::function&lt;&gt;</code> and lambdas (i.e. closures). Lambdas convert to <code>std::function&lt;&gt;</code> and capture local variables.</p>

<p>Lambdas can be used as callbacks so problems solved?</p>

<p>Not for me.</p>

<p>I’ve used <code>std::function&lt;&gt;</code> and I’ve used lambdas and what pushed me away from them were crash reports.</p>



<p>The problem with lambdas is that they are implemented as compiler-generated functions. They get non-descriptive, auto-generated names. When I look at call stack of a crash I can’t map the auto-generated closure name to a function in my code. It makes it harder to read crash reports.</p>

<h2 id="simplest-solution-that-could-possibly-work"><p>Simplest solution that could possibly work</p><a href="#simplest-solution-that-could-possibly-work">

<p>You should know up front that my solution is worse than <code>std::function&lt;&gt;</code> in most ways. It’s not as nice to type as a lambda, it supports a small subset of <code>std::function&lt;&gt;</code> functionality.</p>

<p>On the other hand it’s small, fast and I can understand it.</p>

<p>One thing you need to know about me is that despite working on SumatraPDF C++ code base for 16 years, I don’t know 80% of C++.</p>

<p>I get by thanks to sticking to a small subset that I do understand.</p>

<p>I don’t claim I’ve invented this particular method. It seems obvious in retrospect but it did take me 16 years to arrive at it.</p>

<p>A closure is conceptually simple. It combines code (function) and data:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span><span>using</span> <span>func0Ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>void</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)(</span><span>void</span><span>*</span><span>);</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>struct</span> <span>Func0</span> <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>func0Ptr</span> <span>fn</span><span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>data</span><span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>void</span> <span>Call</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>fn</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>);</span> <span>}</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>};</span>
</span></span></code></pre>
<p>There are 2 big problems with this.</p>

<p>First is annoying casting. You have to do:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span><span>struct</span> <span>MyFuncData</span> <span>{</span> <span>};</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>void</span> <span>MyFunc</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>voidData</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>MyFuncData</span><span>*</span> <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>MyFuncData</span><span>*</span><span>)</span><span>voidData</span><span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>auto</span> <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>MyFuncData</span><span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>auto</span> <span>fn</span> <span>=</span> <span>Func0</span><span>{(</span><span>void</span><span>*</span><span>)</span><span>data</span><span>,</span> <span>MyFunc</span><span>}</span>
</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Second is lack of type safety:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span><span>struct</span> <span>MyFuncData</span> <span>{};</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>void</span> <span>MyOhterFunc</span><span>(</span><span>void</span><span>*</span> <span>voidData</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>MyOtherFuncData</span><span>*</span> <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>MyOtherFuncData</span><span>*</span><span>)</span><span>voidData</span><span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>auto</span> <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>MyFuncData</span><span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>auto</span> <span>fn</span> <span>=</span> <span>Func0</span><span>{</span> <span>MyOtherFunc</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>void</span><span>*</span><span>)</span><span>data</span> <span>};</span>
</span></span></code></pre>
<p>We will call <code>MyOtherFunc</code> with data of <code>MyFunc</code>. This will likely crash.</p>

<p>The good thing is that pointer types are compatible. The machine instructions to call <code>void Foo(void*)</code> are exactly the same as calling <code>void Foo(FooData*)</code>.</p>

<p>We can solve the above annoyances with a bit of cleverness in the form of <code>MkFunc0()</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span><span>template</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>typename</span> <span>T</span><span>&gt;</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>Func0</span> <span>MkFunc0</span><span>(</span><span>void</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>fn</span><span>)(</span><span>T</span><span>*</span><span>),</span> <span>T</span><span>*</span> <span>d</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>auto</span> <span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>Func0</span><span>{};</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>res</span><span>.</span><span>fn</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>func0Ptr</span><span>)</span><span>fn</span><span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>res</span><span>.</span><span>userData</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>void</span><span>*</span><span>)</span><span>d</span><span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>return</span> <span>res</span><span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>void</span> <span>MyFunc</span><span>(</span><span>MyFuncData</span><span>*</span> <span>data</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>}</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>auto</span> <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>MyFuncData</span><span>;</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>auto</span> <span>fn</span> <span>=</span> <span>MkFunc0</span><span>(</span><span>MyFunc</span><span>,</span> <span>data</span><span>);</span>
</span></span></code></pre>
<p>We no longer need to cast data from <code>void*</code> in <code>MyFunc</code>.</p>

<p>Trying to to create a mis-matched <code>auto fn = MkFunc0(MyFunc, new MyOtherFuncData)</code> will error out. The compiler will notice that <code>fn</code>and <code>data</code> arguments don’t match.</p>

<p>We’ll make one improvement: ability to also create closure for functions without any arguments:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span><span>void</span> <span>MyFuncNoData</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>};</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>Func0</span> <span>fn</span> <span>=</span> <span>MkFuncVoid</span><span>(</span><span>MyFuncNoData</span><span>);</span>
</span></span></code></pre>
<p>The implementation cleverness: use a special, impossible value of a pointer (-1) to indicate a function without arguments.</p>

<p>The full implementation is:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span><span>using</span> <span>func0Ptr</span> <span>=</span> <span>void</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)(</span><span>void</span><span>*</span><span>);</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>using</span> <span>funcVoidPtr</span> <span>=</span> <span>void</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)();</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>#define kVoidFunc0 (void*)-1
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>
</span></span><span><span><span>// the simplest possible function that ties a function and a single argument to it

<p><code>Func0</code> only addresses a use case of packaging a function and its own data.</p>

<p>Most of use cases for callbacks require passing additional arguments.</p>

<p>For example a list view control has <code>onItemSelected(int itemIndex)</code> callback.</p>

<p>For that we need <code>Func1</code>:</p>

<p>In <code>Func0</code> the argument must be a pointer because the type is forgotten when we put it in a struct. We rely on the fact that <code>void foo(void*)</code> and <code>void foo(Foo*)</code> are compatible and we can cast the argument and function.</p>

<p>But <code>Func1</code> retains the type of second argument so it can be any type and the right call will happen.</p>

<p>We also don’t want to erase the second type to avoid casts when calling it and to serve as documentation.</p>

<p>We could write <code>Func2</code>for 2 arguments, <code>Func3</code> for 3 arguments etc. but I didn’t bother. If I need more than one argument, I can always use <code>struct</code> to pack any number of arguments into a single one.</p>

<p>So is it worth it to use this over <code>std::function&lt;&gt;</code>?</p>

<p>For me it does and I’ve refactored SumatraPDF to get rid of most of <code>std::function&lt;&gt;</code> uses in favor of <code>Func0</code> and <code>Func1</code>.</p>

<p>Yes, <code>std::function&lt;&gt;</code> is better in many ways.</p>

<p>It’s more flexible. My solution only supports <code>void Foo()</code>, <code>void Foo(T*)</code> and <code>void Foo(T1*, T2)</code>. <code>std::function&lt;&gt;</code> supports arbitrary number arguments of any type.</p>

<p>Compared to writing a lambda with variable capture, I need to write more code:</p>

<ul>
<li>define a <code>struct</code> for closure data</li>
<li>allocate and initialize struct</li>
<li>construct <code>Func0</code> or <code>Func1</code></li>
<li>delete the data (typically at the end of closure)</li>
</ul>

<p>I decided writing this boilerplate doesn’t bother me.</p>

<p>There are fringe benefits of my approach.</p>

<p>On MSVC 64-bit <code>std::function&lt;&gt;</code> is 64 bytes. <code>Func0</code> and <code>Func1</code> are 16 bytes.</p>

<p>Templated code is a highway to bloat. For every unique type, the compiler generates a new class definition on set of methods. Implementation of <code>std::function&lt;&gt;</code> is gigantic compared to <code>Func1</code> and <code>Func2</code>.</p>

<p>Templated code is also a highway to slow compilation. Again, <code>std::function&lt;&gt;</code> is at least order of magnitude more complicated so it’ll take order of magnitude longer to compile.</p>

<p>Finally, I understand my implementation. I don’t understand <code>std::function&lt;&gt;</code> implementation. It’s scarier than Freddy Krueger. It’s scarier than Frankenstein’s monster.</p>

<p>In fact, I don’t think anyone understands <code>std::function&lt;&gt;</code> including the 3 people who implemented it.</p>

    <h2>Datalog in miniKanren</h2>
    <p>Having access to an embedded logical programming language makes some tasks really easy.
       One prerequisite for RealTalk is some form of Datalog, and I built one in Scheme using miniKanren so that I had access to all of the internals.
       This page explains the naive Datalog implementation I did before modifying some of it to fit my version of Dynamicland.</p>
    <p>As a typical example we can look at a directed graph with five vertices labeled a through e.
    Using Datalog, we introduce these vertices as separate records, establish facts about directed edges between them, and then introduce rules about what it means for a vertex to be reachable from another vertex.
    In the end we manually trigger fixpoint analysis and run a query against the resulting database of initial and derived facts.</p>
    <p>
(define dl (make-new-datalog))

(define a (dl-record! dl 'vertex))
(define b (dl-record! dl 'vertex))
(define c (dl-record! dl 'vertex))
(define d (dl-record! dl 'vertex))
(define e (dl-record! dl 'vertex))

(define (dl-edge x y) (dl-assert! dl x 'edge y))
(dl-edge a c)
(dl-edge b a)
(dl-edge b d)
(dl-edge c d)
(dl-edge d a)
(dl-edge d e)

(dl-rule! dl (reachable ,?x ,?y) :- (edge ,?x ,?y))
(dl-rule! dl (reachable ,?x ,?y) :- (edge ,?x ,?z) (reachable ,?z ,?y))

(dl-fixpoint! dl)
(define query (dl-find dl ,?id where (,?id reachable ,?id)))
    </p>

    <p>This is roughly the syntax that I want to go for, minus some of the commas (or unquotes) that I did not get rid of.
    Now that we have a goal, let's jump into the implementation!
    We can define a Datalog instance as a record with the following fields:</p>
    <div><p>
(define-record-type </p><datalog>
  (make-datalog edb idb rdb idx-entity idx-attr counter)
  datalog?
  (edb            datalog-edb)
  (idb            datalog-idb set-datalog-idb!)
  (rdb            datalog-rdb set-datalog-rdb!)
  (idx-entity     datalog-idx-entity)
  (idx-attr       datalog-idx-attr)
  (counter        datalog-counter set-datalog-counter!))
    </datalog></div>
    <p>Most of these are internal indices, each a different hash-table.
       Facts are always a 3-tuple of entity-ID, attribute-name and value.
       Whenever we assert a fact we not only update the main entity table (edb), we also update two indices that index facts by entity (idx-entity) and attribute (idx-attr) respectively.
</p>
    <p>
(define (dl-assert! dl entity attr value)
  (hashtable-set! (datalog-edb dl) (list entity attr value) #t)
  (dl-update-indices! dl (list entity attr value)))

(define (dl-update-indices! dl tuple)
   (let ((entity (car tuple))
         (attr (cadr tuple))
         (idx-entity (datalog-idx-entity dl))
         (idx-attr (datalog-idx-attr dl)))
     (let ((m (hashtable-ref idx-entity entity #f)))
       (if m (hashtable-set! m tuple #t)
         (let ((new (make-hashtable)))
           (hashtable-set! idx-entity entity new)
           (hashtable-set! new tuple #t))))
     (let ((m (hashtable-ref idx-attr attr #f)))
       (if m (hashtable-set! m tuple #t)
         (let ((new (make-hashtable)))
           (hashtable-set! idx-attr attr new)
           (hashtable-set! new tuple #t))))))
    </p>
    <p>The dl-record! macro lets us introduce one or more facts in an easy way:</p>
    <p>
(define-syntax dl-record!
   (syntax-rules ()
     ((_ dl type (attr value) ...) (let ((id (dl-next-id! dl)))
       (dl-assert! dl id (list type attr) value) ... id))))
    </p>
    <p>So far so good. Adding facts to hash-tables is maybe not the most exciting part.
       Next we are going to look at rules, and this will get a lot more interesting!
       Applying a rule is the same thing a running a query against the database.
       In our naive Datalog, running fixpoint amounts to applying each rule, introducing each newly found fact into our set of derived facts, and repeat that process until no more new facts are being introduced.
       We'll start by looking at fixpoint, and come back to rules later as they are the most complicated part of this implementation.
    </p><p>
(define (dl-assert-rule! dl rule)
  (hashtable-set! (datalog-rdb dl) rule #t))

(define (dl-apply-rule dl rule)
  (dl-find rule))

(define (dl-find goal) (runf* goal))

(define (dl-fixpoint! dl)
  (set-datalog-idb! dl (make-hashtable))
  (dl-fixpoint-iterate dl))

(define (dl-fixpoint-iterate dl)
  (let* ((facts (map (lambda (rule) (dl-apply-rule dl rule)) (hashtable-keys (datalog-rdb dl))))
         (factset (foldl (lambda (x y) (set-extend! y x)) facts (make-hashtable)))
         (new (hashtable-keys (set-difference factset (datalog-idb dl)))))
    (set-extend! (datalog-idb dl) new)
    (for-each (lambda (fact) (dl-update-indices! dl fact)) new)
    (if (not (null? new)) (dl-fixpoint-iterate dl))))

    </p>
       As you may have guessed, we will use miniKanren to run queries.
       That dl-find function calls runf*, which is the same as the run* macro from miniKanren but written as a normal function.
       This will make it a lot easier to use it within another macro.
       Similarly, the fresh macro is rewritten as a (slightly less ergonomic) function that now needs the amount of fresh vars as an argument.
    <p>
(define (fresh-vars count kont)
  (lambda (s/c)
    (let loop ((n count) (vars '()) (st s/c))
      (if (zero? n)
        ((apply kont (reverse vars)) st)
        (let ((c (cdr st)))
          (loop (- n 1) (cons (var c) vars) `(,(car s/c) . ,(+ c 1))) )))))

(define (runf* goal) (mK-reify (take-all (call/empty-state goal))))
    </p>
    <p>So now we can run miniKanren as follows, not using any macros:</p>
    <p>    
&gt; (runf* (fresh-vars 1 (lambda (x) (disj (equalo x 5) (equalo x 6)))))
&gt; (5 6)
    </p>
    <p>Now that that is done we can rewrite a rule somewhat like this.
       There is a lot of work needed to actually make that work, but lets start with the rough idea:</p>
    <p>
(dl_rule! (reachable ,?x ,?y) :- (edge ,?x ,?z) (reachable ,?z ,?y))

(dl-assert-rule! dl (fresh-vars 2
  (lambda (q x y)
    (conj (equalo q `(reachable ,?x ,?y))
          (dl-findo dl ((edge ,?x ,?z) (reachable ,?z ,?y))) )))))))))

; once more, with problem areas highlighted:
(dl-assert-rule! dl (fresh-vars [numvars]
  (lambda (q [vars])
    (conj (equalo q [head])
          (dl-findo dl [body]) )))))))))
    </p>
    <p>The dl-rule! macro turns the rule into a function that when ran will try to match all of the body clauses against the database and returns the head with bound variables if it succeeds.
    The dl-findo function implements an extra-logical predicate that follows a pretty typical Datalog optimisation.
    If we try to match a tuple (entity attr value) against the database, we can limit the amount of potential matches if the entity or the attribute are already known.</p>
    <p>
(define-syntax dl-findo
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((_ dl (m ...)) (conj+ (dl-findo_ dl `m) ... ))))

(define (dl-findo_ dl m)
   (fresh (x y entity attr db)
   (conso entity x m)
   (conso attr y x)
     (conde
       [(boundo entity)
          (lookupo (datalog-idx-entity dl) entity db) (membero m db)]
       [(unboundo entity) (boundo attr)
          (lookupo (datalog-idx-attr dl) attr db) (membero m db)] )))

(define (boundo v)
    (lambda (s/c)
      (if (var? v)
        (let ((x (walk v (car s/c))))
          (if (var? x) mzero (unit s/c)))
        (unit s/c))))

(define (unboundo v)
    (lambda (s/c)
      (if (var? v)
        (let ((x (walk v (car s/c))))
          (if (var? x) (unit s/c) mzero))
        mzero)))

(define (lookupo m key value)
    (lambda (s/c)
      (let* ((k (if (var? key) (walk key (car s/c)) key))
             (v (hashtable-ref m k #f)))
       (if v ((equalo value (hashtable-keys v)) s/c) mzero))))
    </p>
    <p>The most problematic part of the dl-rule! macro is figuring out all of the variable scoping and hygiene.
       Using syntax-case ended up being the closest I could get to what I wanted.
       Note that right now the database (dl) is captured in a closure, so we do not have to specify it again when running a rule.</p>
    <p>
(define-syntax dl-rule!
  (lambda (stx)
    (define (symbol-with-question-mark? s)
      (and (symbol? s)
           (let ((str (symbol-&gt;string s)))
             (and (positive? (string-length str))
                  (char=? (string-ref str 0) #\?)))))

  (define (collect-vars datum)
        (cond
          [(symbol? datum)
           (if (symbol-with-question-mark? datum) (list datum) '())]
          [(pair? datum)
             (append (collect-vars (car datum))
                     (collect-vars (cdr datum)))]
          [else '()]))

  (define (remove-duplicates syms)
      (define seen '())
      (define (unique s)
        (let ((d (syntax-&gt;datum s)))
          (if (member d seen) #f
              (begin (set! seen (cons d seen)) #t))))
      (filter unique syms))

  (define (replace-symbols datum sym-&gt;gen)
    (cond
      [(symbol? datum)
       (let ((mapped (assoc datum sym-&gt;gen)))
         (if mapped (cdr mapped) (datum-&gt;syntax stx datum)))]
      [(pair? datum)
       (cons (replace-symbols (car datum) sym-&gt;gen)
             (replace-symbols (cdr datum) sym-&gt;gen))]
      [else (datum-&gt;syntax stx datum)]))

  (syntax-case stx (:-)
    ((_ dl (head hx hy) :- (body bx by) ...)

            (gens (generate-temporaries vars))
            (sym-&gt;gen (map cons vars gens))
            (replaced-head (replace-symbols head-datum sym-&gt;gen))
            (replaced-body (replace-symbols body-datums sym-&gt;gen)))

       #`(dl-assert-rule! dl (fresh-vars #,numvars
           (lambda (q #,@gens)
             (conj (equalo q `#,replaced-head)
                   (dl-findo dl #,replaced-body) )))))))))
    </p>
    <p>Now we are ready to run our example!
       The only thing I have changed is that I have not implemented the dl-find macro yet, so in order to query I have to write things out a bit more. It would have the same problems as dl-rule! and the same solution, I imagine.</p>
    <p>
&gt; (define query (dl-find (fresh-vars 1 (lambda (?id) (dl-findo dl ( (,?id reachable ,?id) ))))))
&gt; (3 1 4)
    </p>
    <p>This should print (3 1 4) or a permutation thereof, order depending on the hash-table implementation.
       As a bonus, this page implements and runs all of the above using Guile Scheme and WebAssembly!
       The result of running all of this should be printed below:</p>

<p id="by"><b>By <a href="https://linuxgazette.net/authors/laycock.html">Oscar Laycock</a></b></p>

<p>
Four years ago, I switched on an old PC and found a seven year old (at
that time) copy of Linux on it. I still use parts of the 1998 Red Hat
Linux, today.  </p>

<h3>Red Hat Linux in 1998</h3>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/redhat.png" alt="powered by Red Hat Linux" width="107" height="58"></p><p>
My copy of Red Hat Linux is 5.1, codenamed "Manhattan". It was released
on May 22, 1998. The first Red Hat Linux 1.0 was released on November 3,
1994. Finally, Red Hat Linux merged with Fedora on 22 September 2003,
when Red Hat started Red Hat Enterprise Linux. I bought an official
boxed set with a manual in the autumn of 1998, for £29.95 (British
Pounds), from a mail-order catalogue. The catalogue also listed Slackware
3.5, Debian 1.3, TurboLinux 2.0, Caldera 1.2, FreeBSD 2.2.7, and BSD
Lite 4.4. Before then, I had been using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherent_(operating_system)">Coherent</a>,
a Unix Version 7 clone, originally produced for the PDP-11 in 1980 and
ported to the IBM PC in 1983.  </p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/box.jpg" alt="boxed set of Red Hat 5.1" width="412" height="309"></p><p>
The kernel is 2.0.34. It does not support thread-local storage, so I get
an error when I run a program built with a recent compiler.  </p>

<p>
Red Hat Linux 5.1 includes a "Linux Applications CD", a collection of
third-party programs. It has versions of 
WordPerfect<a href="#1"><strong>[1]</strong></a>, Tripwire, and
several relational databases.  </p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/wordperf.png" alt="Wordperfect" width="600" height="450"></p><h3>Free software in 1998</h3>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/linux.png" alt="Linux logo from LDP Linux Programming Guide" width="110" height="88"></p><p>
Netscape <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/netrev.html">released</a>
the source code of its browser and Communicator suite on March 31, 1998.
</p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/netscape.png" alt="Netscape Navigator" width="600" height="450"></p><p>
The GNU C Library, glibc, for my Red Hat 5.1 is version 2.0.7. Red Hat
Linux 4.2, released in May 1997, was the last Red Hat Linux based on the
Linux libc "libc 5". The Linux kernel developers had forked glibc in the
early 1990's. Their last version was called libc.so.5. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libc6">Wikipedia</a>, "when FSF
released glibc 2.0 in 1996, it had a much more complete POSIX standards
support, better internationalisation/multilingual support, support for
IPv6, 64-bit data access, support for multithreaded applications, future
versions compatibility support, and the code was more portable. At this
point, the Linux kernel developers discontinued their fork and returned
to using FSF's glibc." The new glibc 2.x series was given the internal
name "libc.so.6".  </p>

<p>
It was the time of the EGCS fork of the GNU C compiler. EGCS stood for
"Experimental/Enhanced GNU Compiler System". My Red Hat 5.1 includes an
early version, 1.0.2, released on March 18, 1998. But the default
compiler is gcc for stability.  GCC development followed a "cathedral"
model and had become quite conservative. In 1997, a group of developers,
some from Cygnus, formed EGCS to merge several forks, including g77
(Fortran), Pentium optimizations and many C++ improvements. According to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection">Wikipedia</a>,
"EGCS development proved considerably more vigorous than GCC
development, so much so that the FSF officially halted development on
their GCC 2.x compiler, 'blessed' EGCS as the official version of GCC
and appointed the EGCS project as the GCC maintainers in April 1999." It
was at that time that GCC was renamed the "GNU Compiler Collection".
</p>

<p>
Red Hat 5.1 came with a 2.0.1 version of PHP/FI. Developer Rasmus
Lerdorf warned that it is "quickly going to be superseded by Version
3.0", citing "dramatic improvements".  PHP3 was released on June 19
1998. 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP_(programming_language)">Wikipedia</a>
says, "Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans, two Israeli developers at the
Technion IIT, rewrote the parser in 1997 and formed the basis of PHP 3,
changing the language's name to the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext
Preprocessor<a href="#2"><strong>[2]</strong></a> ... Suraski and
Gutmans then started a new rewrite of PHP's core, producing the Zend
Engine in 1999. They also founded Zend Technologies in Ramat Gan,
Israel." </p>

<p>
KDE 1.0 was released on 12 July 1998. KDE was founded in 1996. In
November 1998, Qt became open source, dual-licensed under the open QPL
and a commercial license for proprietary development.  </p>


<h3>1998 GNOME beta</h3>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/logo.png" alt="GNOME logo" width="150" height="46"></p><p>
Red Hat 5.1 includes a preview of the GNOME desktop environment, a beta
release.  The release notes say, "It is the results of about 4 months of
feverish work by an Internet-based development team." GNOME development
was announced in August 1997. The first major GNOME release, version
1.0, was to be in March 1999.  </p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/gnome.png" alt="GNOME" width="600" height="450"></p><p>
The GNOME distribution's README file says: "It is indisputable that
Linux is a rock-solid server OS, but traditionally Linux has not catered
as much to the typical desktop user, who wants to write email, browse the
web, etc. The GNOME project aims to provide a desktop environment that
will be friendly to novice users, but at the same time provide the power
and flexibility that advanced users expect." </p>

<p>
GNOME did not come with a window manager. You could just run the GNOME
panel from your .xinitrc file, as in:
</p>

<pre>panel &amp;
background-properties --init &amp;
keyboard-properties --init &amp;
mouse-properties --init &amp;
fvwm2 -f .fvwm2rc.gnome     # disable fvwm2 taskbar
</pre>

<p>
The background, keyboard, and mouse properties programs restore your
previous settings for the background image, mouse sensitivity, and so on.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>file manager</strong> is a GNOME version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Commander">GNU Midnight Commander</a>, a clone of Norton Commander. Midnight Commander has a text user interface and is still <a href="http://www.midnight-commander.org/">developed</a> today. 
</p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/gmc.png" alt="GNOME Midnight Commander" width="600" height="480"></p><p>
The <strong>image viewer</strong> is Electric Eyes, developed by "The
Rasterman", Carsten Haiztler, at Red Hat Advanced Development Labs. He
worked on the Enlightenment desktop. It was one of the first
applications to use Imlib, an X-based imaging toolkit. You can crop
images, do simple color table tweaking, and resize or rotate images. It
was superseded by Eye of Gnome and GQView, neither of which had any
image manipulation features. The last release of Electric Eyes seems to
be 0.3.12 in July 2000.<a href="#3"><strong>[3]</strong></a> It last
appeared in Red Hat Linux 7.3, released in May 2002. It still appeared in
Mandriva till 2007.  </p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/ee.png" alt="GNOME Midnight Commander" width="600" height="480"></p><p>
The release notes have a section on "GNOME Tricks", "a preview of the
awesome abilities DnD will bring to your desktop". You can drag an
image from GNOME Midnight Commander or Electric Eyes, onto the panel or
the background-properties dialog, to set their respective backgrounds. You
can also drag an image from GNOME Midnight Commander onto Electric Eyes.
You can print a file by dragging it from Midnight Commander onto the
print applet in the panel.  </p>

<p>
The <strong>GIMP</strong> is on the GNOME "graphics" menu alongside
Electric Eyes. It is version 0.99.28: </p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/gimp.png" alt="The GIMP" width="580" height="480"></p><p>
The <strong>file open dialog</strong> is much simpler than today's:
</p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/fileopen.png" alt="File open dialog" width="385" height="376"></p><p>
A <strong>message box</strong> looks like this: </p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/question.png" alt="Question dialog" width="254" height="194"></p><p>
<strong>GNOME terminal</strong> does not have modern features like tabs
or transparency. It was written by Miguel de Icaza, and used code from
the Zvt terminal widget by Michael Zucchi. Today's GNOME terminal
appears to date from 2002.  </p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/terminal.png" alt="GNOME terminal" width="600" height="480"></p><p>
In the GNOME <strong>audio</strong> menu, there is the Extace Waveform
display, an audio mixer, and a CD player. On my setup, Extace says it
cannot connect to esound, and I cannot get the mixer to work at all. The
CD player does better: </p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/cd.png" alt="CD player" width="600" height="480"></p><p>
The GNOME applications menu includes emacs and <strong>gEdit</strong>
0.4.0, written by Alex Roberts and Evan Lawrence. It is described as a
"small and lightweight text editor for GNOME/Gtk+". You can only open,
save and print files, cut and paste, and search and replace. The options
to change the text font and toggle auto-indenting do not seem to work.
</p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/gedit.png" alt="gEdit" width="600" height="480"></p><p>
The <strong>GNOME Calendar</strong> resembles the calendar app found in
Microsoft Outlook at that time: </p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/cal3.png" alt="Calendar - edit appointment" width="600" height="480">
</p>

<p>
GNOME has <strong>GTimeTracker</strong> by Eckehard Berns. You select a
project and start and stop a timer. You can run a shell command every
time you select or deselect a project. You can create a log of all your
activities.  </p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/timetrack.png" alt="GTimeTracker" width="600" height="480"></p><p>
GnomeCard, an address book application, and the Gnumeric spreadsheet had
been added by the time of Red Hat Linux 6.0, which was released in April
1999.  </p>

<p>
The <strong>GNOME system monitor program</strong> is GTop 0.20 by Radek
Doulik. In the picture below, in the background, is a coloured chart of
memory usage. You can choose to see the total, shared, or resident sizes.
</p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/gtop.png" alt="GTop" width="600" height="480"></p><p>
The <strong>system log monitor program</strong> is Logview 0.1, by Cesar
Miquel. You can choose a day on the calendar and see the relevant log
entries.  </p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/logview.png" alt="Logview" width="600" height="480"></p><p>
The <strong>GNOME Search Tool</strong> has options to specify a last
modified date range, file ownership, to use the "locate" command, to not
descend into mounted filesystems and to add extra "find" options. It
looks like you can search for specific content or apply a command.
Unfortunately, none of these options works.  </p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/search.png" alt="Search Tool" width="600" height="480"></p><p>
The <strong>GNOME Help Browser</strong> says it is "an interface to the
various forms of documentation present on your computer, and from other
computer via the Internet". It can load a GNOME help page for an
application, although "not much documentation in this format exists
currently". It will load HTML across the Web and present man and info
pages. It will do "whatis" queries, and load local files.  </p>


<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/ghelp.png" alt="GNOME Help" width="412" height="309">

<img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/ghelp2.png" alt="GNOME Help" width="600" height="450"></p><p>
The <strong>games</strong> included are a solitaire card game,
minesweeper, mahjongg, and the "same game". Inspiration for the "same
game" came from the KDE game.  </p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/freecell.png" alt="solitaire" width="600" height="498">

<img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/mines.png" alt="minesweeper" width="216" height="234">

<img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/mahjongg.png" alt="mahjongg" width="300" height="239">

<img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/same.png" alt="same game" width="300" height="222"></p><p>
GXSNMP is a basic SNMP <strong>network management</strong> application.
Unfortunately, I do not have a network!  </p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/snmp.png" alt="SNMP application" width="600" height="619"></p><p>
On the GNOME system menu are various <strong>properties</strong> screens:
</p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/background.png" alt="Background properties" width="504" height="474">
<img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/screensaver.png" alt="Screensaver properties" width="504" height="474">
<img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/bell.png" alt="Bell properties" width="504" height="308">
<img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/keyboard.png" alt="Keyboard properties" width="504" height="349">
<img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/mouse.png" alt="Mouse properties" width="504" height="239">
<img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/lookfeel.png" alt="Look and feel properties" width="504" height="176"></p><p>
There are two menu options to run a command. They lead to the
<strong>"grun"</strong> program, which shows a simple dialog with an input
box, which runs the typed command in my root xterm. It does not seem to
do anything else.  </p>

<p>
There is also yagIRC, "Yet Another GTK+ based IRC client" and GHex, a
binary file editor. The browser is Netscape Navigator.  </p>

<p>
The <strong>panel applets</strong> include Wanda the Fish, ready with a
fortune cookie. There are CD player and audio mixer applets. I do not
appear to have a mixer, so it is not shown.  </p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/wandaapps.png" alt="Wanda and CD player panel applets" width="211" height="52"></p><p>
There are four "monitor" applets available in the panel, showing battery
usage, CPU load, disk/memory usage, and disk usage: </p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/monitorapps.png" alt="Monitor panel applets" width="372" height="52"></p><p>
The "network" applets comprise: a PPP dialer, a mailcheck, modem lights,
network load monitor and a "Web control" to launch Netscape Navigator.
(The network load applet says it needs IP accounting turned on in the
kernel, to work.) </p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/networkapps.png" alt="Network panel applets" width="440" height="52"></p><p>
There are several "utility" applets for the panel, including a clock, a
clock and mailcheck together, a floppy drive mounter, and the
drag-and-drop printer applet. There is also a workspace pager (not
shown), which says it needs a window manager with the XA_ extensions. I
am using "twm", which is probably not sufficient.  </p>

<p><img src="https://linuxgazette.net/165/misc/laycock/utilityapps.png" alt="Utility panel applets" width="283" height="52"></p><h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
From switching on, I can get to the 1998 GNOME desktop in two to three
seconds, whereas with a recent kernel and KDE it takes thirty. I like
the simplicity. The programs do most of what I want.  </p>



<p> [1] <span>Rick Moen comments</span>:  That would
be Corel WordPerfect 8.0 Download Personal Edition, which was really
an extraordinary product: a stable, fast, polished, full-featured
word processor running in about 6 MB of RAM, compiled from the fabled
WordPerfect Corporation portable C version that they originated
on NeXTStep.  It's still a credible Linux option to this day (if
barely), which is amazing - although the problem of retrofitting needed
support libs is onto modern Linux distributions, by now, daunting and 
can only get worse.
</p>

<p>
It's poignant to consider how much better Corel might be doing if they'd
stuck with quality portable C code, rather than dallying first with a
buggy and resource-grabbing Java rewrite, and then with yet another
ground-up rewrite in C++ / Microsoft Foundation Classes, which in turn
forced them to abandon all OS platforms other than Win32.  
</p>

<p>Fans of the 1990s WordPerfect for Linux 8.x series can get
information including the fix for the Filtrix bug, language packs, and 
other useful resources via my 
<a href="http://en.tldp.org/FAQ/WordPerfect-Linux-FAQ/">WordPerfect for
Linux FAQ</a>.
</p>

<p>
The version of Tripwire you mention was "Tripwire Academic Source
Release (ASR)", a no-charge for non-commercial usage licence.  About a
year later (October 2000), Tripwire, Inc. converted the product over to
GPL (with a proprietary variant also available with additional features
and support).
</p>

<p> [2] <span>Rick Moen comments</span>:  In the grand
open source tradition of Slightly Dopey Initial Project Names They'd
Rather We No Longer Remember, Rasmus's language and related code were
originally called "Personal Home Page".  (See also "Kool Desktop
Environment".)
</p>

<p> [3] <span>Rick Moen comments</span>:  I hear that
the show-stopper with Electric Eyes was Imlib's limitations:  Rendering
and scaling were primitive and memory-management faulty, and it was
missing too many needed features.  Eye of GNOME was based on gdk-pixbuf, a 
<a href="http://developer.gnome.org/feature/archive/gdkpixbuf/gdk-pixbuf.html">specific
replacement</a>.

<p>I recently found myself needing to change the monitor that a cheap HDMI “dummy plug” pretended to be. It was a random one I had bought on Amazon several years ago that acted as a 4K monitor, and I needed it to be something simpler that didn’t support a 4K resolution. The story behind why is a long one that I’m still figuring out and might eventually become a separate blog post in the future.</p>



<p>If you’re not familiar with dummy plugs, here’s a quick primer: they are tiny dongles you can plug into an HDMI, DVI, etc. port that don’t actually do anything with the video signal. They simply have the minimum circuitry needed for a video source device, like a computer, to think that a monitor is hooked up. In general this entails a pull-up resistor on pin 19 (HPD) to +5V, as well as a little I<sup>2</sup>C EEPROM chip containing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Display_Identification_Data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Extended Display Identification Data (EDID)</a>. This is useful for headless machines to force the OS to think a monitor is attached.</p>

<p>The EDID contains all the info about the monitor: the manufacturer, manufacture date, supported resolutions, audio channels, color space, and stuff like that. My goal was to replace the dummy plug’s EDID with an identical copy of an EDID from one of my many 1080p HDMI capture devices. Then, the computer I plugged it into would think the capture device was plugged in instead of a 4K monitor, and everything would be hunky dory.</p>



<p>I wasn’t sure if the dummy plug’s EDID EEPROM would be programmable, but I decided to give it a shot. There was a chance that it would have its write-protect pin configured to disable programming, but I figured it wouldn’t hurt to try.</p>



<p>Conveniently, I found that my Raspberry Pi Zero has an I<sup>2</sup>C controller wired to the correct pins on its HDMI port. This makes sense — the Pi would need to be able to read the EDID of an attached monitor. <a href="https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=329239#p1970760" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This post on the Raspberry Pi Forums</a> and <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/issues/6207#issuecomment-2149784322" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this GitHub comment</a> were helpful for explaining which I<sup>2</sup>C controller(s) to look at in software on various Pi devices:</p>



<ul>
<li>Pi 0-3:
<ul>
<li><code>/dev/i2c-2</code></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Pi 4:
<ul>
<li><code>/dev/i2c-20</code></li>



<li><code>/dev/i2c-21</code></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Pi 5:
<ul>
<li><code>/dev/i2c-11</code></li>



<li><code>/dev/i2c-12</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Before I go further,<strong> I want to make it clear that it may be possible to screw up a monitor if you follow these instructions while a real monitor is plugged in and it doesn’t have its EDID protected</strong>. Be careful to only run these commands if you have something attached to the HDMI port that you’re not afraid of bricking, such as a dummy plug! <strong>Also, make sure you are confident you’re on the correct I<sup>2</sup>C bus! Always read the EDID and parse it first to make sure it actually contains an EDID before you attempt a write.</strong> If you attempt these commands on a PC, it’s possible that you could accidentally flash hardware that isn’t an EDID, like a RAM module’s SPD EEPROM.</p>



<p>Starting from a fresh Raspberry Pi OS Lite install, I performed the following modifications:</p>



<ul>
<li><code>sudo raspi-config</code>
<ul>
<li>Under Interface Options, enable I<sup>2</sup>C <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as described in the Raspberry Pi documentation</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><code>sudo apt install i2c-tools</code>
<ul>
<li>Unfortunately, this requires network access, which creates a bit of a problem if you are on a Pi Zero. You might need a USB-Ethernet adapter to make this happen. Another slightly crazy option is to temporarily take the SD card out of your Pi, put it into your desktop PC running Debian/Ubuntu, run <code>sudo apt install binfmt-support qemu-user-static</code> on your PC, <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/RaspberryPi/qemu-user-static" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chroot into the SD card’s rootfs</a> (options 1.3 and 2.1 worked for me), and run the apt install command inside of the chroot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>And with those prerequisites out of the way, I was ready to start tinkering with the dummy plug’s EEPROM. Note that I also needed an HDMI-to-Mini-HDMI adapter.</p>

<p>Since I was using a Raspberry Pi Zero, I chose bus 2. You could change the number below to something else on a different model, as listed above (e.g. 20 or 21 on a Pi 4).</p>





<p>I ran i2cdetect to see if the EDID EEPROM was recognized:</p>





<p>This came back with the following result, showing that an I<sup>2</sup>C device was detected at address 0x50, which is exactly the address used for EDID:</p>



<pre>     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f<br>00:                         -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <br>10: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <br>20: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <br>30: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <br>40: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <br>50: 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <br>60: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- <br>70: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --                         </pre>



<p>Interestingly, this particular dummy plug also responds with addresses 0x51 through 0x57 present. These other addresses seem to contain copies of the same EDID. Not all dummy plugs show up like this — another one I have only detects 0x50. Anyway, next, I dumped the original EDID from it:</p>


<div><pre title="">get-edid -b $edid_i2c &gt; edid-orig.bin
</pre></div>


<pre>2<br>This is read-edid version 3.0.2. Prepare for some fun.<br>Attempting to use i2c interface<br>Only trying 2 as per your request.<br>256-byte EDID successfully retrieved from i2c bus 2<br>Looks like i2c was successful. Have a good day.</pre>



<p>Nice! To make sure I got a good dump, I tried it twice and compared the results to make sure they were identical. Then I printed it in a format suitable for copying/pasting to something like <a href="https://www.edidreader.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">edidreader.com</a>:</p>


<div><pre title="">od -v -An -txC edid-orig.bin
</pre></div>


<p>This spit out a nice little hex dump of the EDID that was stored on it:</p>



<pre> 00 ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 1a ae 31 9d 00 00 00 00<br> 01 19 01 04 85 58 31 78 3e a4 fd ab 4e 42 a6 26<br> 0d 47 4a 2f cf 00 e1 c0 d1 c0 b3 00 a9 40 95 00<br> 81 80 81 40 81 c0 02 3a 80 18 71 38 2d 40 58 2c<br> 45 00 e0 0e 11 00 00 1e 4d d0 00 a0 f0 70 3e 80<br> 30 20 35 00 c0 1c 32 00 00 1a 00 00 00 fc 00 48<br> 44 4d 49 20 4d 6f 6e 69 74 6f 72 0a 00 00 00 10<br> 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 4a<br> 02 03 46 70 52 e1 60 5f 5d e6 65 64 62 10 04 03<br> 1f 20 21 22 13 12 01 26 09 7f 07 11 7f 50 83 01<br> 00 00 6e b9 14 00 40 00 18 78 20 00 60 01 02 03<br> 04 67 d8 5d c4 01 78 00 07 6c 03 0c 00 20 00 f0<br> 78 20 00 40 01 04 08 e8 00 30 f2 70 5a 80 b0 58<br> 8a 10 c0 1c 32 00 00 1e b7 e6 ff 18 f1 70 5a 80<br> 58 2c 8a 00 ff 1c 32 00 00 1e 56 5e 00 a0 a0 a0<br> 29 50 30 20 35 00 80 68 21 00 00 1a 00 00 00 e9</pre>



<p>Pasting it into the site linked above, I could see it was a valid EDID:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="465" height="476" src="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image.png 465w, https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-293x300.png 293w" sizes="(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px"></figure>



<p>Now that I was confident I had the dummy plug’s original EDID backed up, I unplugged it from the Pi’s HDMI port and plugged my capture device in instead, and repeated the exact same procedure to dump its EDID:</p>


<div><pre title="">get-edid -b $edid_i2c &gt; edid-capture-card.bin
</pre></div>


<p>I confirmed it was also a valid EDID. Finally, I unplugged the capture device and connected the dummy plug again, and wrote the capture device’s EDID to it with this fun little code snippet. <a href="https://github.com/galkinvv/edid-checked-writer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">There are tools out there</a> that can probably do this more efficiently, but hey, this works and doesn’t require any special packages other than the standard userspace Linux I<sup>2</sup>C tools and bash or dash!</p>


<div><pre title="">edidbytes=($(od -v -An -txC edid-capture-card.bin))
for i in "${!edidbytes[@]}"; do
	byte=0x${edidbytes[$i]}
	echo Writing byte $i: $byte...
	i2cset -f -y $edid_i2c 0x50 $i $byte
done
</pre></div>


<p>As a quick explanation, this reads the entire EDID (probably 256 bytes in size) from the dump file created earlier, and formats it into an array of two-digit hex strings using od. Each entry in the array represents one byte in the EDID. Then it loops over each byte, prepending a “0x” prefix and writing it out to the EEPROM using i2cset.</p>



<p>After running this code, I re-read the EDID from the dummy plug and checked to see if it matched the file I started from:</p>


<div><pre title="">get-edid -b $edid_i2c &gt; edid-test.bin
diff edid-test.bin edid-capture-card.bin
</pre></div>


<p>The diff command produced no output at all, which indicated that the new dump was identical. The dummy plug’s EEPROM had successfully been reprogrammed with the EDID from my capture device!</p>



<p>Of course, at this point I anxiously plugged it into my test computer, powered the computer up, and noticed that everything was great and it acted as though my HDMI capture device was plugged in instead of a 4K monitor. Success!</p>



<p>I thought I’d share this procedure in case it’s useful for someone else in the future. You could probably also use this solution to go in the opposite direction — upgrading an old 1080p dummy plug to add 4K support. <strong>Again, be careful with these commands!</strong> I wouldn’t recommend tinkering with I<sup>2</sup>C writes on an actual PC. Use a Raspberry Pi so you don’t accidentally brick your desktop PC.</p>

<p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang criticized Anthropic head Dario Amodei over his recent claims that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/anthropic-ceo-says-ai-could-cause-up-to-20-percent-unemployment-within-five-years-wipe-out-half-of-all-entry-level-white-collar-jobs" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/anthropic-ceo-says-ai-could-cause-up-to-20-percent-unemployment-within-five-years-wipe-out-half-of-all-entry-level-white-collar-jobs">50% of all entry-level white-collar jobs could be wiped out by artificial intelligence</a>, causing unemployment to jump to 20% within the next five years. Huang disagreed with Amodei’s predictions when he was asked about it during VivaTech in Paris, where he said that he “pretty much disagree[s] with almost everything” the Anthropic CEO said, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://fortune.com/2025/06/11/nvidia-jensen-huang-disagress-anthropic-ceo-dario-amodei-ai-jobs/" data-url="https://fortune.com/2025/06/11/nvidia-jensen-huang-disagress-anthropic-ceo-dario-amodei-ai-jobs/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">Fortune</a>.</p><p>“One, he believes that AI is so scary that only they [Anthropic] should do it. Two, that AI is so expensive, nobody else should do it… and three, AI is so incredibly powerful that everyone will lose their jobs, which explains why they should be the only company building it,” said Huang. “I think AI is a very important technology; we should build it and advance it safely and responsibly. If you want things to be done safely and responsibly, you do it in the open… Don’t do it in a dark room and tell me it’s safe.”</p><p>Dario Amodei founded Anthropic with several former OpenAI employees in 2021 after they left the latter over its direction and safety concerns. The former still works on developing AI, but it’s focused on taking a safer, more ethical approach, helping ensure that humanity does not create a tool that will pose a risk to its existence. Its latest AI model, Claude 4 Opus, was shown to have the capability to write code that approaches the capabilities of humans, as well as scheme, deceive, and manipulate its users, even getting to the point of creating false email threads to blackmail engineers who were attempting to shut it down.</p><p>Anthropic responded to Huang’s claims, telling Fortune that, “Dario has never claimed that ‘only Anthropic’ can build safe and powerful AI. As the public record will show, Dario has advocated for a national transparency standard for AI developers (including Anthropic) so the public and policymakers are aware of the models’ capabilities and risks and prepare accordingly. He has also raised concerns about the economic impact of AI — particularly on entry-level jobs. Dario stands by these positions and will continue to do so.”</p><p>This disagreement shows the two CEOs' different approaches towards artificial intelligence. Amodei is more cautious, and he thinks about the risk that AI poses to the average worker. Furthermore, he’s pushing lawmakers to do something about this disruption to make the transition much smoother for society.</p><p>On the other hand, while Huang agrees that some jobs will be made obsolete and that almost every career will be changed, he also says that there will be more openings and opportunities for people. He believes that as companies become more productive through AI, they will also need to hire more personnel to expand their operations.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" target="_blank" data-url="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em> to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

<p>The Netscape/Microsoft browser wars in the mid-90's were really vicious and competitive. They really had it out for each other.</p><p>Netscape had developed the SSL protocol. The initial version had cryptographic flaws and was broken pretty quickly, and never released. The first production version was SSL 2, which was in use for a few years. (I don't know the exact versions of Navigator it shipped in.)</p><p>SSL 2 had some flaws, both cryptographic and practical; not dramatic enough to make replacing it a crisis, but it clearly needed some work from early on.</p><p>As a part of the cutthroat competition, Microsoft decided to revise the SSL 2 protocol with some additions of their own, and specified a protocol called "PCT" that was derived from SSL 2. It was only supported in IE and IIS.</p><p>Netscape also wanted to address SSL 2 issues, but wasn't going to let Microsoft take leadership/ownership in the standard, so they developed SSL 3.0, which was a more significant departure.</p><p>Various people in the industry &amp; community didn't want a fork, so we (Consensus Development, where I worked with <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/">Christopher Allen</a> at the time, and where I had written the <a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/Security/Security-54/SecureTransport/privateInc/ssltrspt.h">SSL 3.0 reference implementation</a> under contract to Netscape) hosted a meeting between representatives from Netscape and Microsoft; I forget everyone who was there, but I recall that <a href="https://www.schneier.com/">Bruce Schneier</a> was there (before he was famous), and probably <a href="http://www.cryptography.com/company/profiles/paul-kocher.html">Paul Kocher</a>, who had designed the SSL 3 protocol; Barbara Fox represented Microsoft. And we negotiated a deal where Microsoft and Netscape would both support the IETF taking over the protocol and standardizing it in an open process, which led to me editing the RFC.</p><p>As a part of the horsetrading, we had to make some changes to SSL 3.0 (so it wouldn't look the IETF was just rubberstamping Netscape's protocol), and we had to rename the protocol (for the same reason). And thus was born TLS 1.0 (which was really SSL 3.1). And of course, now, in retrospect, the whole thing looks silly.</p>
