<h3>from the <i>told-you-so</i> dept</h3>

<p>Before T-Mobile acquired Sprint, activists, consumer groups, and deal critics (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18634195/t-mobile-sprint-merger-conditions-access-coverage">including me</a>) warned repeatedly that the telecom sector megadeal would result in layoffs, less competition, higher prices, and a lower quality product overall. The Trump FCC and DOJ very clearly didn’t care; they rubber stamped the deal <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/10/22/fcc-approved-t-mobile-sprint-merger-without-even-seeing-full-details/">without even reading deal impact reports</a>. </p>
<p>T-Mobile CEO John Legere, famous for wearing magenta high tops and occasionally saying “fuck,” <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/un-carrier/new-t-mobile-creating-jobs">called deal critics liars</a>, insisting that the combination of the fourth and third biggest carrier would result in lower prices, bold new innovations, untold new synergies, and would be “<a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/un-carrier/new-t-mobile-creating-jobs">jobs positive from day one</a>.” </p>
<p>It didn’t take long before Legere and T-Mobile executives were proven to be liars. T-Mobile quickly moved to lay off <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/12j6vvd/3_years_after_sprint_merger_tmobile_employs_9k/">9,000 employees</a>, and the company’s competitive edge completely evaporated. And a new report by Finland based research firm Rewheel found that the merger immediately <a href="https://research.rewheel.fi/downloads/The_state_of_mobile_and_broadband_pricing_1H2024_PUBLIC_REDACTED_VERSION.pdf">effectively stopped nearly all meaningful price competition in the U.S. wireless market</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Five years on, the Sprint / T-Mobile 4-to-3 mobile merger made the US one of the most expensive mobile markets in the world.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before the merger, deal critics repeatedly pointed out that in every single country where regulators allowed a consolidation from four to three wireless carriers, it effectively stopped price competition dead in its tracks. With less incentive to compete on price, U.S. wireless providers simply stopped trying. Now, U.S. consumers once again pay some of the highest prices for mobile data in the world:</p>

</div>
<p>Keep in mind: these studies often can’t or won’t include all of the various ways telecoms nickel-and-dime you with hidden fees and surcharges post sale (activation fees, etc.), so the <a href="https://community.t-mobile.com/billing-61/t-mobile-bill-keeps-increasing-for-no-reason-52086">real world impact</a> on consumers financially is actually likely worse. Gone also are all the little “uncarrier” pro-consumer efforts T-Mobile attempted to use to differentiate themselves from AT&amp;T and Verizon. </p>
<p>Employees, of which there are 9,000 less of now, will also tell you T-Mobile <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/12j6vvd/3_years_after_sprint_merger_tmobile_employs_9k/">is a shadow of its former self</a>. </p>
<p>Of course T-Mobile knew this would happen. It was the entire point. Less competition allows for greater nickel-and-diming of consumers, higher prices, and fatter profits for investors (at first). Trump regulators obviously knew it would happen as well; to justify approval they proposed the half-assed, doomed effort to pretend Dish would become a viable fourth replacement option (<a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/06/20/dish-network-and-its-new-5g-network-is-probably-doomed/">as predicted</a>, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/03/08/dish-network-the-trump-era-fix-for-the-sprint-t-mobile-merger-heads-into-its-final-death-spiral/">it isn’t</a>). </p>
<p>Trump regulators not only didn’t even read the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/10/22/fcc-approved-t-mobile-sprint-merger-without-even-seeing-full-details/">deal impact reports</a>, the Trump DOJ’s top “antitrust enforcer,” Makan Delrahim, actively worked with the companies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/19/technology/sprint-t-mobile-merger-antitrust-official.html">using his personal devices in his free time</a> to ensure the deal saw government approval. You might recall T-Mobile <a href="https://observer.com/2018/06/corey-lewandowski-t-mobile-womp-womp-immigration-fox-news/">hired Corey Lewandowski</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1QM1ZK/">ramped up the time they spent at Trump hotel properties</a> to help seal the clearly-corrupt deal.</p>
<p>That is all, if you’re unfamiliar, not how “antitrust enforcement” is supposed to work, no matter what “free market” and “Libertarian” telecom sector funded think tanks like to claim. </p>
<p>It’s important to remember that the previously competitive T-Mobile was a direct byproduct of the Obama DOJ’s decision in 2011 to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_purchase_of_T-Mobile_USA_by_AT%26T#:~:text=On%20August%2031%2C%202011%2C%20the,AT%26T%20on%20December%2019%2C%202011.">block AT&amp;T’s attempted acquisition of T-Mobile</a>. That decision, actually based on evidence, protected competition and consumer welfare. That history is usually memory holed by “free market,” telecom-funded think tank apologists for mindless consolidation. </p>
<p>Somewhere former T-Mobile CEO John Legere is sitting on a giant pile of money. Maybe he sometimes experiences a slight twinge of conscience watching the pro-consumer company he helped build steadily turn into AT&amp;T. But so unconcerned are T-Mobile executives with accountability for lying to regulators, they still <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/un-carrier/new-t-mobile-creating-jobs">haven’t bothered to delete Legere’s 2019 pre-merger lies from the T-Mobile website</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Neovim 0.10 was the longest release cycle since the heady days of the 0.5
release. There are a ton of new features in this release (as well as some
breaking changes), so be sure to check the full <a href="https://neovim.io/doc/user/news-0.10.html">release notes</a>. You can
view the release notes directly in Nvim with <code>:h news</code>. The news file includes
information on new features, deprecations, and breaking changes. I especially
urge plugin authors to read this file carefully.</p>
<p>Like <a href="https://gpanders.com/blog/whats-new-in-neovim-0-7/">last time</a>, in this post I’ll cover a subset of the new features.
As I said, it’s a big release, and I won’t write about everything, but these
are some of the highlights.</p>

</h2>
<h3 id="colorscheme">
  <a href="#colorscheme">Colorscheme</a>
</h3>
<p>Nvim has been in need of a new default colorscheme for a long time. While the
default colors have some charm and nostalgia, there are serious accessibility
and aesthetic issues, particular when using Nvim is a diff viewer. The
screenshot below shows the default colorscheme before Nvim 0.10:</p>
<figure><img src="https://gpanders.com/img/nvim-colorscheme-old.png" alt="Neovim's default colorscheme before 0.10">
</figure>

<p>Nvim 0.10 now ships with a new default colorscheme, which you can see below:</p>
<figure><img src="https://gpanders.com/img/nvim-colorscheme-new.png" alt="Neovim's new default colorscheme">
</figure>

<p>The new default colorscheme was heroically contributed by <a href="https://github.com/echasnovski">Evgeni
Chasnovski</a>, who endured seemingly endless bikeshedding and
successfully navigated the treacherous waters of such a subjective change.
There were many constraints imposed on the design of the colorscheme, which
you can read in the <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/26334">PR</a> (and the many follow up PRs and issues linked
therein). It is quite literally impossible to please <em>everyone</em> with a single
colorscheme, and there is no expectation that we have achieved that, but the
new colorscheme does, hopefully, improve the default experience for many
people.</p>
<h3 id="lsp-and-diagnostics-mappings">
  <a href="#lsp-and-diagnostics-mappings">LSP and Diagnostics Mappings</a>
</h3>
<p>Nvim 0.10 adds a new <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/24331">default mapping</a>: <code>K</code> in Normal mode maps to
<code>vim.lsp.buf.hover()</code> whenever a buffer attaches to an LSP client, unless
<code>'keywordprg'</code> is already set to a non-default value. Use this to view
information about the function or variable under the cursor. This in addition
to the existing defaults mentioned in <code>:h lsp-defaults</code> which were added in
the previous release.</p>
<p>In addition, there are new <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/16230">default mappings</a> for navigating
diagnostics:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>[d</code> and <code>]d</code> in Normal mode map to <code>vim.diagnostic.goto_prev()</code> and
<code>vim.diagnostic.goto_next()</code>, respectively. Use these to navigate between
diagnostics in the current buffer.</li>
<li><code>&lt;C-W&gt;d</code> (and <code>&lt;C-W&gt;&lt;C-D&gt;</code>) in Normal mode map to
<code>vim.diagnostic.open_float()</code>. Use this to view information about any
diagnostics under the cursor in a floating window.</li>
</ul>
<p>The diagnostics mappings override builtin mappings. These builtin mappings are
not often used, but if you <em>do</em> use them you can delete the new default
mappings with <code>vim.keymap.del()</code> or <code>:unmap</code>.</p>
<p>The intention behind providing more default mappings is to make it easier to
get started with LSP in Neovim. The hope is that most users should be able to
get up and running with useful LSP features with little to no configuration
and without needing to write a bunch of Lua code. We have plans to add more
defaults in future releases, though as you might imagine this is a fraught
exercise. It is quite difficult to change default behavior in a tool as
extensible and customizable as Nvim without breaking users'
<a href="https://xkcd.com/1172/">workflows</a>.</p>
<p>Two features which many users rely on for their LSP experience are snippets
support and autocompletion. Both of these features are on the roadmap to be
included in Nvim core (see <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/27339">#27339</a>, <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/25696">#25696</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/25670">#25670</a>) which
will, hopefully, make the experience of using LSP in Neovim even smoother in
the future.</p>

<p>Longtime Vim users are likely familiar with the venerable <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary">vim-commentary</a>
plugin, which creates mappings and operators for commenting and uncommenting
text. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/echasnovski">Evgeni Chasnovski</a>, Nvim 0.10 now <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/28176">bundles this
functionality</a> by default, using a from-scratch implementation in
Lua. Unlike vim-commentary, Nvim’s builtin implementation provides a text
object and supports Tree-sitter, which is useful when working in injected
languages (example: if you comment text inside a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag in an HTML
buffer, it will correctly use the Javascript <code>//</code> comment string rather than
HTML’s <code>&lt;!-- --&gt;</code> comment string).</p>
<p>See <code>:h commenting</code> for more details.</p>
<h2 id="terminal-ui-enhancements">
  <a href="#terminal-ui-enhancements">Terminal UI enhancements</a>
</h2>
<p>Nvim 0.10 adds support for many new terminal based capabilities.</p>
<h3 id="synchronized-output">
  <a href="#synchronized-output">Synchronized Output</a>
</h3>
<p>Many modern terminal emulators support <a href="https://gist.github.com/christianparpart/d8a62cc1ab659194337d73e399004036">synchronized output</a> which allows
terminal applications (like Nvim) to “batch” all of their UI updates in the
terminal emulator and display them all at once. This can reduce “flickering”
and “tearing” when a terminal UI (TUI) is being drawn very rapidly. This can
sometimes happen in Nvim when using plugins that perform rapid UI updates
(e.g. spinners, LSP status windows, etc.). Nvim 0.10 introduces a new
<code>'termsync'</code> option (enabled by default) which enables this feature if it is
supported by the terminal emulator.</p>
<h3 id="system-clipboard-synchronization">
  <a href="#system-clipboard-synchronization">System clipboard synchronization</a>
</h3>
<p>Nvim 0.10 can now use the OSC 52 escape sequence to write to (or read from)
the system clipboard. OSC 52 is only used automatically when (1) it is able to
determine that the terminal emulator supports it (via XTGETTCAP), (2) it is
running in an SSH session, and (3) when the <code>'clipboard'</code> option is unset.
Note that some terminal emulators do not support reading from the system
clipboard with OSC 52, or only allow it after prompting the user for
confirmation. It is recommended to use the traditional “paste” key binding
(e.g. <code>Cmd+V</code> on macOS or <code>Ctrl+Shift+V</code> on Linux) to paste into Nvim from the
system clipboard and use <code>"+</code> to copy to the clipboard inside Nvim (see <code>:h quoteplus</code>).</p>
<h3 id="hyperlinks">
  <a href="#hyperlinks">Hyperlinks</a>
</h3>
<p>Nvim 0.10 introduces experimental support for hyperlinks using the OSC 8
sequence. By default, this is used in Markdown for links of the form
<code>[example](https://example.com)</code>. If your terminal emulator supports the OSC 8
escape sequence, then the text <code>example</code> in the Nvim buffer will contain a
hyperlink that can be clicked and will open <code>https://example.com</code> in your web
browser.</p>
<p>This means that users can view Markdown files with <code>:set conceallevel=2</code> and
get an experience much closer to the rendered output:</p>
<figure><img src="https://gpanders.com/img/nvim-readme.png" alt="Screenshot of the Neovim README opened in Nvim">
</figure>

<p>In the screenshot above, the underlined words are clickable link text, just as
you would find in a web browser.</p>
<h3 id="automatic-truecolor-detection">
  <a href="#automatic-truecolor-detection">Automatic truecolor detection</a>
</h3>
<p>Nvim 0.10 will now automatically determine if the terminal emulator supports
24 bit color (“truecolor”) and enable the <code>'termguicolors'</code> option if it does.
It does this through a combination of heuristics (<code>$COLORTERM</code>, terminfo) and
terminal queries (DECRQSS, XTGETTCAP). This detection works even over SSH
connections and when inside a terminal multiplexer such as <code>tmux</code>.</p>

  <a href="#lsp-inlay-hints">LSP inlay hints</a>
</h2>
<p>Nvim 0.10 now supports <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/23984">LSP inlay hints</a> thanks to <a href="https://github.com/p00f">Chinmay
Dalal</a>. A picture here will do more than my words can:</p>
<figure><img src="https://gpanders.com/img/nvim-inlay-hints.png" alt="Screenshot of Nvim showing inlay hints">
</figure>

<p>The dark colored texts which display type annotations for variable declarations
are inlay hints. This text is not part of the actual source file in the
buffer, but is “virtual” text inserted by Nvim and provided by the language
server. These hints can be enabled or disabled dynamically using
<code>vim.lsp.inlay_hint.enable()</code>.</p>
<p>Many other new LSP features were added in Nvim 0.10 as well. Refer to the
“LSP” section in <code>:h news</code> for a full list.</p>
<h2 id="tree-sitter-query-editor">
  <a href="#tree-sitter-query-editor">Tree-sitter query editor</a>
</h2>
<p>Nvim 0.10 adds even more tools for working with Tree-sitter queries. If you
didn’t know already, Nvim bundles an “inspector” which allows you to view the
abstract syntax tree of any source file with the <code>:InspectTree</code> command (so
long as a Tree-sitter parser for the file’s language is installed). Example:</p>
<figure><img src="https://gpanders.com/img/nvim-inspect-tree.png" alt="Screenshot of the :InspectTree command in Nvim">
</figure>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/MariaSolOs">Maria José Solano</a>, Nvim 0.10 adds a powerful
capability to the Tree-sitter inspector: <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/24703">a query editor</a>. The query
editor allows you to write queries and see the matches in a source buffer in
real time. Being able to create and modify queries interactively makes writing
new queries a breeze. Example:</p>
<figure><img src="https://gpanders.com/img/nvim-query-editor.png" alt="Screenshot of the :EditQuery command in Nvim">
</figure>

<p>In the screenshot above, the query editor is open in the top-right window, the
tree inspector is in the bottom-right window, and the source buffer is in the
left window. Notice that the text that is matched by the query in the query
editor is highlighted in the source buffer and that the text <strong>initializer</strong>
(the capture group used in the query) is floating on the line next to the
match. As the query is updated in the editor, the corresponding highlights in
the source buffer change in real time.</p>
<p>The query editor can be opened by pressing <code>o</code> in the <code>:InspectTree</code> window,
with the <code>:EditQuery</code> command, or by calling <code>vim.treesitter.query.edit()</code>
directly.</p>
<p>With <code>:InspectTree</code> and <code>:EditQuery</code>, Neovim is one of the best tools (if not
<em>the</em> best tool) for working with Tree-sitter, even if you don’t actually use
Neovim.</p>
<h2 id="miscellaneous">
  <a href="#miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</a>
</h2>
<p>As I mentioned at the top of this post, there are <em>a lot</em> of new features in
this release, and I am not going to cover all of them. Here I’ll list a few
more that I personally think are worth mentioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <code>:terminal</code> command now accepts modifiers, so you can use e.g. <code>:botright terminal</code> (or <code>:bo te</code>) to open a new terminal window in a split at the
bottom of your screen. In addition, <code>:terminal</code> buffers that are started
with no arguments (and thus open a shell) will close automatically when the
shell exits without an error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>gx</code> in Normal mode calls <code>vim.ui.open()</code> on whatever is under the cursor,
which shells out to your operating system’s “open” capability (e.g. <code>open</code>
on macOS or <code>xdg-open</code> on Linux). For instance, pressing <code>gx</code> on a URL will
open that URL in your browser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tree-sitter based syntax highlighting is enabled by default for Lua, Vimdoc
(<code>:help</code>), and Tree-sitter queries (to revert to traditional regex
based syntax highlighting, create a <code>FileType</code> autocommand or <code>ftplugin</code>
with <code>vim.treesitter.stop()</code> for the respective filetype).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Q</code> and <code>@</code> in Visual mode will execute the last recorded/executed macro for
all visually selected lines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users using a terminal emulator that supports the Kitty keyboard protocol
can create mappings using the “super” and “meta” modifiers with the <code>&lt;D-</code>
and <code>&lt;T-</code> prefixes, respectively (e.g. <code>&lt;D-S&gt;</code> is <code>Cmd+S</code> on macOS).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="roadmap">
  <a href="#roadmap">Roadmap</a>
</h2>
<p>The Neovim project is loosely organized and structured. We follow a “fun
driven development” paradigm: for the most part, contributors and maintainers
work on things that are personally interesting to them. Because of this, it
can be difficult to predict what will happen in future releases. If there is a
feature you want to see implemented, the best way to do it is to take a crack
at it yourself: many of the features mentioned in this very blog post were
contributed by users that are not part of the “core” maintenance team!</p>
<p>There is active chatter about further improving the LSP and Tree-sitter
experience (as mentioned above, builtin snippet and completion support are a
work-in-progress). One of the biggest challenges with Tree-sitter is parser
distribution: currently, parsers are shared object files which must be
compiled on every user’s machine or distributed with a system package manager.
We are already working on implementing the new <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/28415">Tree-sitter WASM
capabilities</a> which will enable distributing Tree-sitter parsers as
portable WASM blobs. This solves the distribution problem and may enable
Neovim to ship more Tree-sitter parsers out of the box.</p>
<p>We would also like to integrate some of the functionality from
<a href="https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig">nvim-lspconfig</a> so that, ideally, nvim-lspconfig is just a “bag of configs”
without any smarts or core logic. How best to do this is still hotly debated,
but it is something that is being discussed.</p>
<h2 id="getting-involved">
  <a href="#getting-involved">Getting Involved</a>
</h2>
<p>There is nothing quite as fun as hacking on your own tools. If you are a
Neovim user, I encourage you to get involved, whether that is through
contributing directly to the Neovim project or a plugin, or simply
participating in community spaces such as the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#neovim:matrix.org">Neovim Matrix room</a>. If you
have pain points or frustrations when using Neovim, please let us know. Many
of us on the core maintenance team have been using Vim/Nvim for so long that
we’ve forgotten what it’s like to be a beginner and, speaking for myself at
least, this can leave blind spots on how things can be improved.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and for using Neovim! Hopefully the next update will come a
little sooner.</p>
<h2 id="one-last-thing">
  <a href="#one-last-thing">One Last Thing</a>
</h2>
<p>The Neovim project now has a merch <a href="https://store.neovim.io/">store</a>! If you
didn’t know that you needed a Neovim branded hoodie or mug, now you do. All
proceeds raised from the store are used to fund project needs and sponsor
full-time development work.</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <hr>

  <p>
  F* (pronounced <it>F star</it>) is a general-purpose proof-oriented
  programming language, supporting both purely functional and
  effectful programming. It combines the expressive power of dependent
  types with proof automation based on SMT solving and tactic-based
  interactive theorem proving.
  </p><p>
  F* programs compile, by default, to OCaml. Various fragments of F*
  can also be extracted to F#, to C or Wasm by a tool
  called <a href="https://github.com/FStarLang/karamel">KaRaMeL</a>,
  or to assembly using
  the <a href="https://github.com/project-everest/vale">Vale</a>
  toolchain. F* is implemented in F* and bootstrapped using OCaml. 
  </p><p>
  F* is open source on <a href="http://github.com/FStarLang/FStar">GitHub</a> and is under 
  active development by <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Research</a>, 
  <a href="http://prosecco.gforge.inria.fr/">Inria</a>, and by the community.
</p></div><div id="download">
 <h2>Download</h2>
 <hr><p>
  F* is distributed under the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FStarLang/FStar/master/LICENSE" target="_blank">Apache 2.0 license</a>.
  Binaries for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X are posted regularly on the <a href="https://github.com/fstarlang/fstar/releases">releases page on GitHub</a>.
  You can also install F* from OPAM, Docker, Nix, or build it from sources, by following the instructions in <a href="https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/blob/master/INSTALL.md">INSTALL.md</a>.

  <h2>Project Everest</h2>
    <p>
    <a href="https://project-everest.github.io/">Project Everest</a> is an umbrella project that develops high-assurance
    secure communication software in F*. A big part of the development of F* has been motivated by the scenarios
    that Project Everest targets. Several offshoots from Project Everest continue as their own projects, including
    some of those listed below.
  </p><h2>HACL*, ValeCrypt, and EverCrypt</h2>
    <p>
    <a href="https://hacl-star.github.io/">HACL*</a> is a library of high-assurance cryptographic primitives, written in F* and extracted to C.
    <a href="https://github.com/hacl-star/hacl-star/tree/main/vale">ValeCrypt</a> provides formally proven implementations of cryptographic primitives in Vale, 
    a framework for verified assembly language programming embedded in F*.
    <a href="https://hacl-star.github.io/EverCryptDoc.html">EverCrypt</a> combines them into a single cryptographic provider.
    Code from these projects is now used in production in several projects,
    including <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2017/09/13/verified-cryptography-firefox-57/">Mozilla Firefox</a>,

  </p><h2>EverParse</h2>
    <p>
    <a href="https://project-everest.github.io/everparse/">EverParse</a> is a parser generator for binary formats that produces C code extracted from formally proven F*.
    Parsers from EverParse are used in production in several projects, including in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/everparse-hardening-critical-attack-surfaces-with-formally-proven-message-parsers/">Windows Hyper-V</a>, 
    where every network packet passing through the Azure cloud platform is parsed and validated first by code generated by EverParse. EverParse is also used in other
    production settings, including <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ebpf-for-windows">ebpf-for-windows</a>.

              <p>The challenge before Johns Hopkins University engineering students: Take a leaf blower, but make it quiet. Make it work as powerfully as ever, but do not allow it to emit the ear-piercing caterwaul that has gotten leaf blowers banned in some communities and cursed in many others.</p>

<p>Shocking their sponsors, their advisers, and even themselves a little, the students did it.</p>

<p>Their improved leaf blower drops the overall noise level by nearly 40% while almost entirely erasing the most obnoxious frequencies. The design is patent-pending and Stanley Black &amp; Decker expects to be selling them in two years.</p>

<p>"We spent many hours on this project, just going through the various versions of it, just constantly iterating and improving and so for that to finally pay off, this was really, really rewarding," said team member Michael Chacon, who like the rest of the four-member team is a senior majoring in mechanical engineering. "We are stoked and super, super proud."</p>

<p>The team started working last September. They hoped to improve an electric or battery-powered leaf blower, which is already much quieter than the notorious gas-powered ones, where the sound can carry over an average suburban block.</p>

<p>They spent months figuring out the leaf blower piece by piece, analyzing all of its the noises and why it made them. They then spent many more months spit-balling possible improvements, refining some ideas, killing even more.</p>

<p>"The sound that comes out of this leaf blower is very complicated and it contains a lot of different frequencies," said team member Andrew Palacio. "A lot of different notes on a piano would be a good analogy."</p>

<p>They workshopped more than 40 versions of the solution they finally settled on: an attachment that cuts the machine's noise almost like a silencer on a gun or a muffler on a car.</p>

<p>"Our product takes in a full blow of air and separates it," said team member Leen Alfaoury. "Some of that air comes out as it is, and part of it comes out shifted. The combination of these two sections of the air makes the blower less noisy."</p>

<p>Adds Chacon: "It ultimately dampens the sound as it leaves, but it keeps all that force, which is the beauty of it."</p>

<p>Their design cuts the most shrill and annoying frequencies by about 12 decibels, which all but removes them, making them 94% quieter. The team reduced the overall leaf blower noise by about two decibels, making the machine sound 37% quieter.</p>

<p>So it's a quieter machine, and what people can hear will sound more pleasant.</p>

<p>"It's the difference between hearing a high-pitched whistle and hearing what you might think of as wind noise," said team member Madison Morrison.</p>

<p>Alfaoury thinks the best way to describe it is "muffled."</p>

<p>"It's suppressed, if that makes sense," she said. "Like the noise is deeper. It is not screechy. There's no high pitch sound that is like really annoying to hear."</p>

<p>Team adviser Stephen Belkoff puts it bluntly: "It's still a leaf blower but it's not nearly as annoying as it was before they got involved."</p>

<p>The design wowed Stanley Black &amp; Decker officials, who can't wait to start manufacturing and selling the new tools.</p>

<p>"It's not just some cool theoretical thing that will sit on a shelf and never be heard from again—this is ready to be mass manufactured," said Nate Greene, senior product manager at Stanley Black &amp; Decker, who graduated from Johns Hopkins in 2017 with an engineering degree. "This is a really rare and dramatic level of success."</p>

<p>The student team expects their solution could be adapted to quiet other similarly loud appliances like vacuums and hairdryers.</p>

<p>Remote work expert <a href="https://twitter.com/mixteenth/status/1390692158240342017">David Tate wrote</a> that <strong>when fearful CEOs talk about workplace culture, they’re really talking about workplace control</strong>. Their insecurities demand that the way work is done by employees is always visible, highly regulated and uses the methods executives prefer, rather than what’s best for everyone’s productivity. Remote work is seen as a threat to many CEOs simply because of their fear of change and resistance to progress. That fear leads to an irrational rejection of remote work, instead of a thoughtful examination of where it has succeeded and what can be learned. </p>



<p>In her May 6th Washington Post opinion article, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/05/06/ceo-i-want-my-employees-understand-risks-not-returning-work-office/">I worry about the erosion of office culture with more remote work</a>, CEO Cathy Merill makes two fundamental mistakes common among fearful executives. First, it shows an ignorance of alternatives, as many organizations have worked remotely for years before the pandemic and <a href="https://scottberkun.com/2017/why-remote-workers-fail/">have solved problems she considers unsolvable</a>. She may not prefer these approaches, but her lack of awareness of them is incompetence. Second, she is infantilizing her employees by presuming they are not capable of and motivated to be productive and collaborate even when the CEO can’t see them down the hallway.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are over a year into a pandemic and an era of great social unrest and uncertainty, yet Merill has chosen remote work, and not other likely psychological or cultural factors, as the singular reason why workplace performance has declined. And if this wasn’t enough of an oversight, her evidence against remote work consists mostly of examples from executive friends of their self-described management incompetence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She offered the story of an anonymous CEO with a new but struggling employee. Yet none of the leadership team did anything about it: </p>



<blockquote><p>&nbsp;A friend at a Fortune 500 company tells of a colleague who was hired just as the pandemic hit. He struggled. He wasn’t getting the job done. It was very hard for the leadership team to tell what the problem was. Was it because he was new? Was he not up to the work? What was the specific issue? Worse, no one wanted to give him feedback over Zoom when they hadn’t even met him. Professional development is hard to do remotely.</p></blockquote>



<p>This is simply a management failure. Does this company not have telephones? Or email? Have they never worked with a vendor or client that wasn’t in the same building? They are responsible for helping this employee regardless of what technologies are available or not. This is inept management hiding behind technological fear. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Merill estimates that 20% of work is helping a colleague or mentoring more junior people, extra work that she feels is impossible to do remotely. This is despite dozens of popular collaboration tools and mentoring programs that work entirely online. It also denies the dozens of remote corporations like <a href="https://scottberkun.com/yearwithoutpants/">Automattic</a> and Citrix that have vibrant work cultures where these “extra” activities are successfully done remotely. </p>



<p>Merill and her peers might not like these alternatives, but she never explains why. She even goes so far as to suggest that remote workers should be paid less and lose their benefits, since in her estimation they will never be able to contribute in these extra ways. She effectively threatened her own staff through the article (she <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2021/05/09/the-cautionary-tale-of-the-washingtonian-magazines-ceo-who-warned-employees-what-would-happen-if-they-didnt-return-to-the-office/?sh=2da183bd6931">apologized later</a> after her staff revolted). </p>



<blockquote><p>If the employee is rarely around to participate in those extras, management has a strong incentive to change their status to “contractor.” Instead of receiving a set salary, contractors are paid only for the work they do, either hourly or by appropriate output metrics. That would also mean not having to pay for health care, a 401(k) match and our share of FICA and Medicare taxes</p></blockquote>



<p>One quality of a great CEO is the ability to look into the future and show their organization the way forward. Instead of blaming employees, they take responsibility for solving problems. For every serious issue that arises they ask themselves what can I do or change in my own behavior that can lead my staff to a better place? They diversify their network to ask “who has solved the problem my organization is facing somewhere else and what can we learn?” Or perhaps most critical of all, they invite their own employees to participate in both defining the problem and exploring ways to solve it, instead of drawing lines in the sand and assuming the only way forward is the one that makes them the most comfortable. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Technology is often seen as a silver bullet, oversold as the magic solution that can solve hard problems. This overestimates what a technology can do, as often it’s the management culture that is the real cause. But in the case of Merill, her CEO peers and remote work, technology is being used as a scapegoat. It’s the safe target to blame as it requires no introspection or accountability. Leaders that do this become fear-driven, allowing their competitors an advantage simply by exercising curiosity and seeking new knowledge. Smart CEOs chose to invest in their work culture and grow it for the future instead of hoping for the past to return.&nbsp;</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/16/eu-opens-child-safety-probes-of-facebook-and-instagram-citing-addictive-design-concerns/">https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/16/eu-opens-child-safety-probes-of-facebook-and-instagram-citing-addictive-design-concerns/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40377154">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook and Instagram are under formal investigation in the European Union over child protection concerns, the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_2664" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Commission announced</a> Thursday. The proceedings follow a raft of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/01/meta-dsa-rfi-2-child-safety/">requests for information to parent entity Meta</a> since the bloc’s online governance regime, the Digital Services Act (DSA), started applying last August.</p>

<p>The development could be significant as the formal proceedings unlock additional investigatory powers for EU enforcers, such as the ability to conduct office inspections or apply interim measures. Penalties for any confirmed breaches of the DSA could reach up to 6% of Meta’s global annual turnover.</p>

<p>Meta’s two social networks are designated as very large online platforms (VLOPs) under the DSA. This means the company faces an extra set of rules — overseen by the EU directly — requiring it to assess and mitigate systemic risks on Facebook and Instagram, including in areas like minors’ mental health. </p>

<p>In a briefing with journalists, senior Commission officials said they suspect Meta of failing to properly assess and mitigate risks affecting children. </p>

	
	


	
	


<p>They particularly highlighted concerns about addictive design on its social networks, and what they referred to as a “rabbit hole effect,” where a minor watching one video may be pushed to view more similar content as a result of the platforms’ algorithmic content recommendation engines.</p>

<p>Commission officials gave examples of depression content, or content that promotes an unhealthy body image, as types of content that could have negative impacts on minors’ mental health.</p>

<p>They are also concerned that the age assurance methods Meta uses may be too easy for kids to circumvent. </p>


	
	


	
	


<p>“One of the underlying questions of all of these grievances is how can we be sure who accesses the service and how effective are the age gates — particularly for avoiding that underage users access the service,” said a senior Commission official briefing press today on background. “This is part of our investigation now to check the effectiveness of the measures that Meta has put in place in this regard as well.”</p>

<p>In all, the EU suspects Meta of infringing DSA Articles 28, 34, and 35. The Commission will now carry out an in-depth investigations of the two platforms’ approach to child protection.</p>

<p>The EU opened a similar probe into addictive design concerns on video sharing social network TikTok <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/22/tiktok-lite-dsa-probe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last month</a>.</p>

<p>Reached for a response to the EU investigation, a Meta spokesperson emailed us this statement: “We want young people to have safe, age-appropriate experiences online and have spent a decade developing more than 50 tools and policies designed to protect them. This is a challenge the whole industry is facing, and we look forward to sharing details of our work with the European Commission.”</p>

	
	


	
	


<p>The company also told us its approach to verifying the age of users of the two social networks relies on a combination of self declared age and AI assessments to try to detect kids who may be lying about their age. Additionally, it said it allows people to report suspected underage accounts, adding that it trains its content reviewers to flag accounts that may be used by underage minors. </p>

<p>Users who are under 18 and attempt to edit their age on its platforms will be challenged to choose and submit to an age verification test, per Meta — however the company did not specify which age verification checks it offers. But it claimed that internal tests of the efficacy of its approach indicate the approach is working to prevent minors from accessing age-appropriate experiences. Since instigating the checks Meta said it has been able to stop 96% of teens who attempted to edit their birthdays from under 18 to over 18 on Instagram from doing so.</p>

<p>The Commission also already opened two DSA investigations on Meta’s social networks. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/30/meta-first-dsa-probes/">Last month</a> it said it would investigate separate concerns related to Facebook’s and Instagram’s approach to election integrity.</p>

<p>So, Jason opens a cold email. The deal seems decent, but not that exciting. Then, he notices that the date on the cover is outdated. Small detail? Yes, but also a red flag that tips the scale. Jason passes.</p>
<p>Congratulations, you just got introduced to the VC "game of inches".</p>
<h2 id="signaling-and-red-flags-vcs-play-a-game-of-inches">Signaling and red flags: VCs play a game of inches</h2>
<p>Founders may be horrified, but look at the investor's point of view.</p>
<p>A VC receives 10 to 50 decks per week. Out of those, 10% are hot: think OpenAI. These deals don't even need a deck to raise. They thrive on FOMO, it's a <a href="https://www.openvc.app/blog/pool-party" target="_blank">pool party</a>. VCs fight for allocation on those cap tables.</p>
<p>Then there's the rest.</p>
<p>The bottom 90%. The normal founders. You and I.</p>
<p>For these ones, it's an elimination process: kill as many decks as fast as possible. Whatever remains gets a second look.</p>
<p>
    <b>This is where "red flags" come into play. Because VCs have zero context on a cold email, they rely on micro-signals:</b>
</p>
<figure>
    <ul>
        <li>"Market size is $200Tn" -&gt; Founder is naive or delusional</li>
        <li>Lots of text written small -&gt; Founder has low empathy, poor marketing skills</li>
        <li>The deck is outdated&nbsp; -&gt; Founder has low attention to details</li>

<p>(By the way, the OpenVC pitch deck tutorial explicitly says to never include the date on your cover. If you haven't read it, it's free and available to all founders <a href="https://openvc.app/blog/startup-pitch-deck" target="_blank">here</a> ).</p>

<p>VCs want to see as many deals as possible. Even if they barely open your deck, they want to increase their "coverage rate" and report a growing top of funnel to their LPs.</p>
<p>
    <b>Founders however, especially first-time founders, rarely get that nuance. They want to believe that there's a bunch of nice people who will support their journey with advice, cheers, and yes, money.</b>
</p>
<p>This is partly true. Most VCs I've met - and I've met 100+ at this point - are good human beings and diligent professionals.</p>
<p>But they remain money allocators. Don't be fooled by the Allbirds, the fleece vest, and the Twitter threads. VCs are investors. They manage millions of dollars, report to their own investors (the LPs) and if they don't deliver the expected returns, they won't raise their next fund.</p>
<p>As much as they want to be your friends, the fund comes first (as it should).</p>

<p>This brings us back to Jason Lemkin's post.</p>
<p>I actually believe Jason's post to be sincere and helpful.</p>
<p>For one thing, he is one the few who actually opens cold emails, replies to them, and invests in them. He famously funded Algolia, Pipedrive, Salesloft, and Talkdesk on a cold email.</p>
<p>
    <b>He also openly shares his decision-making process, which is rare and valuable. Think about it: investment bankers and experienced founders know better than sending an outdated deck. Now, outsiders know about this, too.</b>
</p>
<p>That's why I believe Jason did nothing wrong.</p>
<p>He just gave founders a sense of how ruthless and biased the selection process can be. A few founders got offended, but many more learnt from it and adjusted their decks accordingly.</p>
<p>All in all, it's a net positive.</p>

<p>I work with first-time founders on a daily basis.</p>
<p>I've noticed a typical emotional journey from excitement (pre-raise) to frustration (1-2 months into the raise) to downright anger (3+ months) when they realize VCs don't open their decks, don't reply to their emails, and don't provide <a href="https://openvc.app/blog/investors-honest-feedback" target="_blank">any feedback</a>.</p>
<p>I believe this is due to wrong expectations.</p>
<p>If you've never dealt with professional investors, this is something you have to learn.</p>
<p>
    <b>VCs aren't your teachers nor your managers. They don't have an obligation to provide feedback or even to reply to your emails. They won't give you a second chance. They won't coach you so you can do better next time.</b>

<p>Instead, think of a VC as a sales prospect.</p>

<p>Of course, you can also decide that belly dancing for VCs is not your thing and go another route like bootstrapping. Perfectly reasonable.</p>
<p>Simply remember: VCs are investment professionals before being a founder's best friend.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Infrastructure used to maintain and distribute the Linux operating system kernel was infected for two years, starting in 2009, by sophisticated malware that managed to get a hold of one of the developers’ most closely guarded resources: the /etc/shadow files that stored encrypted password data for more than 550 system users, researchers said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The unknown attackers behind the compromise infected at least four servers inside kernel.org, the Internet domain underpinning the sprawling Linux development and distribution network, the researchers from security firm ESET said. After obtaining the cryptographic hashes for 551 user accounts on the network, the attackers were able to convert half into plaintext passwords, likely through password-cracking techniques and the use of an advanced credential-stealing feature built into the malware. From there, the attackers used the servers to send spam and carry out other nefarious activities. The four servers were likely infected and disinfected at different times, with the last two being remediated at some point in 2011.</p>
<h2>Stealing kernel.org’s keys to the kingdom</h2>
<p>An infection of kernel.org <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2011/08/31/linux_kernel_security_breach/">came to light</a> in 2011, when kernel maintainers revealed that 448 accounts had been compromised after attackers had somehow managed to gain unfettered, or “root,” system access to servers connected to the domain. Maintainers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/09/who-rooted-kernel-org-servers-two-years-ago-how-did-it-happen-and-why/">reneged on a promise</a> to provide an autopsy of the hack, a decision that has limited the public’s understanding of the incident.
</p><p>Besides revealing the number of compromised user accounts, representatives of the Linux Kernel Organization provided no details other than saying that the infection:</p>
<ul>
<li>Occurred no later than August 12, 2011, and wasn't detected for another 17 days</li>
<li>Installed an off-the-shelf rootkit known as Phalanx on multiple servers and personal devices belonging to a senior Linux developer</li>
<li>Modified the files that both servers and end user devices inside the network used to connect through OpenSSH, an implementation of the SSH protocol for securing remote connections.</li>
</ul>                                            
                                                        
<p>In 2014, ESET researchers said the 2011 attack likely infected kernel.org servers with a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/03/10000-linux-servers-hit-by-malware-serving-tsunami-of-spam-and-exploits/">second piece of malware</a> they called Ebury. The malware, the firm said, came in the form of a malicious code library that, when installed, created a backdoor in OpenSSH that provided the attackers with a remote root shell on infected hosts with no valid password required. In a little less than 22 months, starting in August 2011, Ebury spread to 25,000 servers. Besides the four belonging to the Linux Kernel Organization, the infection also touched one or more servers inside hosting facilities and an unnamed domain registrar and web hosting provider.
</p><p>A <a href="https://web-assets.esetstatic.com/wls/en/papers/white-papers/ebury-is-alive-but-unseen.pdf">47-page report</a> summarizing Ebury's 15-year history&nbsp;said that the infection hitting the kernel.org network began in 2009, two years earlier than the domain was previously thought to have been compromised. The report said that since 2009, the OpenSSH-dwelling malware has infected more than 400,000 servers, all running Linux except for about 400 FreeBSD servers, a dozen OpenBSD and SunOS servers, and at least one Mac.</p>
<p>Researcher Marc-Etienne M. Léveillé wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>In our 2014 paper, we mentioned that there was evidence that kernel.org, hosting the source code of the Linux kernel, had been a victim of Ebury. Data now at our disposal reveals additional details about the incident. Ebury had been installed on at least four servers belonging to the Linux Foundation between 2009 and 2011. It seems these servers acted as mail servers, name servers, mirrors, and source code repositories at the time of the compromise. We cannot tell for sure when Ebury was removed from each of the servers, but since it was discovered in 2011 it is likely that two of the servers were compromised for as long as two years, one for one year and the other for six months.</p>
<p>The perpetrator also had copies of the /etc/shadow files, which overall contained 551 unique username and hashed password pairs. The cleartext passwords for 275 of those users (50%) are in possession of the attackers. We believe that the cleartext passwords were obtained by using the installed Ebury credential stealer, and by brute force.</p></blockquote>
<p>The researcher said in an email that the Ebury and Phalanx infections appear to be separate compromises by two unrelated threat groups. Representatives of the Linux Kernel Organization didn’t respond to emails asking if they were aware of the ESET report or if its claims were accurate. There is no indication that either infection resulted in tampering with the Linux kernel source code.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently <a href="https://without.boats/blog/references-are-like-jumps/">Boats wrote a blog post</a> about Rust, mutable aliasing, and the sad story of local reasoning over many decades of computer science. I recommend that post and agree with its main points! Go read it! But I also thought I'd add a little more detail to an area it's less acutely focused on: formal methods / formal verification.</p><p><b>TL;DR</b>: support for <em>local</em> reasoning is a big factor in the ability to do <em>automated</em> reasoning about programs. Formal verification involves such reasoning. Rust supports it better than many other imperative systems languages -- even some impure functional ones! -- and formal verification people are excited and building tools presently. This is not purely by accident, and is worth understanding as part of what makes Rust valuable beyond "it doesn't need a GC".</p><p>The rest of this post is just unpacking and giving details of one or more of the above assertions, which I'll try to address in order of plausible interestingness to the present, but I will also throw in some history because I kinda can't help myself.</p><p><b>What even are formal verification tools?</b></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods">Formal methods</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification">formal verification</a> tools are tools that <em>prove</em> properties hold over large (possibly infinite) amounts of a program's entire possible state space, rather than testing the program on individual paths through that state space. They use <em>computational logics</em> for this, sometimes in very complex ways. They are a very old field in computer science, going back at least 50 years. A certain contingent -- including the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare">Tony Hoare</a> (no relation) -- have maintained since the late 60s that we <em>really ought</em> to be proving all of our programs correct, and that it will be tractable to do so any day now (or perhaps already is if we tried harder). There's way too much to summarize in a blog post, but <a href="http://venge.net/assets/talks/formal-world.pdf">I gave a talk recently covering some of it</a>. It does <em>sometimes</em> work, but it's not yet made it as big as its proponents have always wanted.</p><p>In the <em>best</em> case -- and this is actually approached, sometimes, by some tools today -- the developer experience can be something like "you write an </p><tt>assert!()</tt><p> in your code, and the IDE puts a green squiggly underline when it can prove that that assert always holds over all possible executions, and a red squiggly underline if it has a counterexample possible-execution where the assert won't hold". Absolute <em>magic</em>.</p><p><b>How does local reasoning relate to formal verification?</b></p><p>Formal verification involves inferring, propagating, resolving and relating formulas in sound computational logics (eg. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoare_logic">Hoare logic</a>) that characterize a program's possible states. These formulas start with the literals and variables in a program and are then combined by rules (eg. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_transformer_semantics">Dijkstra's predicate-transformer rules</a>) driven by the composite syntactic and semantic forms of the programming language, including function applications, variable assignments, conditional branching, sequential composition and so forth.</p><p>The rules for combining logical formulas across variable assignments typically have to modify all formulas involving the modified variable to correctly account for the change. This is a problem if the underlying programming language has uncontrolled mutable aliasing: potentially <em>every logical formula</em> might change when you make an assignment through a reference, because the logic has no idea what other variables the reference might write-to in a given run of the program. Essentially "all bets are off" at any write through a pointer.</p><p>There are various partial workarounds -- reasoning about type disjointness, or about sets of disjoint possible-aliases, eventually the development of a whole family of logics (eg. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_logic">separation logic</a>) that account for the disjointness of portions of the heap and the reachable "footprints" of functions -- but for a very, very long time the field has been held back by programming languages with too much mutable aliasing to be tractable.</p><p><b>And Rust makes this better?</b></p><p>Yes. Rust references are subject to the "shared-xor-mutable" rule, which means a write through a reference <em>doesn't</em> invalidate any other variables in existing formulas. This makes it much easier to write a tool that verifies Rust code. Don't just believe me! Here's formal verification hacker Xavier Denis saying as much:</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">rust's avoidance of shared mutable state has deep consequences; when we formally verify programs in Rust we can use FOL and avoid separation logic since the type system protects us from mutable aliasing, while this is not true in caml despite being 'functional'</p>— xavxav (@xldenis) <a href="https://twitter.com/xldenis/status/1790297114519404692?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 14, 2024</a></blockquote> <p><b>What Rust formal verification projects are there?</b></p><p>Tons! And they're very exciting. <a href="https://github.com/viperproject/prusti-dev">Prusti</a>, <a href="https://github.com/model-checking/kani">Kani</a>, <a href="https://github.com/GaloisInc/crucible/tree/master/crux-mir">Crux-Mir</a>, <a href="https://github.com/AeneasVerif/aeneas">Aeneas</a>, <a href="https://github.com/flux-rs/flux">Flux</a>, <a href="https://github.com/creusot-rs/creusot">Creusot</a>, <a href="https://github.com/facebookexperimental/MIRAI">MIRAI</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hacspec/hax">Hax</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hopv/rust-horn">RustHorn</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Rust-Proof/rustproof">Rustproof</a>, <a href="https://github.com/verus-lang/verus">Verus</a> .. plus lots of <a href="https://github.com/newca12/awesome-rust-formalized-reasoning">supporting crates and projects in computational logic</a>.</p><p><b>Was Rust designed for formal verification?</b></p><p><em>Kinda</em>. There are two fairly different ways in which this is partly true, one usually forgotten and one possibly non-obvious: typestate and borrow checking. I will discuss both briefly below. Both are what we'd at best call "lightweight" formal methods, in the sense that the annotation burden is comparatively low, the word "logic" doesn't make much of an appearance, and the verification is fast and reliable, integrated into the normal workflow of programming. Indeed, some people call type systems themselves "lightweight formal methods", and we had no shortage of people on the team who were comfortable (much more comfortable than me!) with this sort of thing.</p><p>Moreover, even before the project was overrun by MIT and CMU folks (j/k I love you all), I was generally aware of Hoare logics when doing early Rust, and the extent to which mutable aliasing was a problem for them, and that limiting mutable aliasing helped. I was aware that pure-functional languages, affine languages, or those with un-observable writes (eg. with Copy-on-Write) could propagate logical formulas more readily. I was aware Butler Lampson and Jim Horning's "verification-oriented" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid_(programming_language)">Euclid systems language</a>, for example, had shipped pointers with disjointness guarantees to support local reasoning as far back as the late 70s. I even registered and maintained the domain name </p><tt>rust-proof.org</tt><p> early on, thinking it might wind up coming in handy if we went further in that direction.</p><p>But in a broader sense it is not true that Rust was "designed for" formal verification. I was <em>not</em> totally fluent in Dijkstra's approach to automatic generation of verification condition formulas in Hoare logics, and I was not closely following the ongoing revolutions in either separation logic or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-driven_clause_learning">CDCL SAT solvers</a> that were pushing the boundary of that approach. I had (wrongly) convinced myself well before Rust that the approach was a bit of a weird dead end, and believed that the future of formal methods was either in stepwise refinement calculi like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-Method">B-method</a>, or interactive dependent-type or higher-order-logic provers like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coq_(software)">Rocq (nee Coq)</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HOL_(proof_assistant)">HOL</a>, or other sorts of pure-functional hybrid logic languages like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACL2">ACL2</a>. I did not think any of these was likely to be usable for the broad audience of systems programmers I was aiming Rust at, and was happy to limit its formal verification ambitions to something I could explain to normal programmers, like a typestate system.</p><p>(And I was actually a bit annoyed at how involved the analysis got for the borrow checker; it's long passed my ability to accurately describe what it's doing, and I apologize for the somewhat mangled explanations to follow.)</p><p><b>Typestate</b></p><p>A usually-forgotten chapter in Rust's history is that it initially had a typestate system. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typestate_analysis">Typestate systems</a> let you annotate a program's variables with n-ary predicates that get checked dynamically when they're initially established, but are also subject to static analysis of their propagation and validity as values flow through the program. For example you can mark a function as requiring a given predicate on its arguments, and then it becomes an obligation for the caller to have established somewhere before the call (or a requirement they can place on their caller, etc.)</p><p>Eventually people figured out that you can emulate typestates fairly well (though a bit awkwardly) with a combination of affine types and phantom types, both of which Rust supports, so the typestate feature was dropped from the language, but this was a part of the original design that lived quite a ways into the project's life, and was part of the motivation for control over mutable aliasing. If you ever see mention of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes_(programming_language)">Hermes</a> and NIL in Rust's influences, this is what is meant: these languages have typestates and prohibit mutable aliasing in order to support it.</p><p><b>Borrow checking</b></p><p>Borrow checking is the other motivation, and it's an interesting case because it both requires <em>and provides</em> local reasoning support. It's a key actor in the story! Its main purpose is to prove that any given access through a </p><tt>&amp;</tt><p> or </p><tt>&amp;mut</tt><p> reference is accessing valid memory. To do this it sets out to prove the property that reference lifetimes are shorter than referent lifetimes: a pointer always points to something live.</p><p>But it turns out mere lifetime nesting isn't enough, because Rust is a language with non-uniform representation: not every pointer points to a separate heap cell, but rather a </p><tt>&amp;</tt><p> or </p><tt>&amp;mut</tt><p> reference can point into the middle of some existing value, and that might be a value like an enum that can change size or shape when it's overwritten. So to ensure memory safety, the borrow checker also needs to know that a referenced value with a variable size or shape <em>doesn't change size or shape while referenced</em>, and so it <em>also</em> enforces the "shared-xor-mutable" property on references. And somewhat coincidentally, this rule in turn provides quite strong local reasoning for <em>any</em> property of Rust programs you might want to formally verify.</p><p>While earlier versions of Rust had a much more limited version of </p><tt>&amp;</tt><p> and </p><tt>&amp;mut</tt><p> references -- they were "second class", could not be returned from functions or embedded in structs, only passed as arguments -- they still provided strong support for local reasoning, for the same memory-safety reasons. But their limited expressivity meant the machinery required to check and enforce their properties was much simpler than the full glory of the modern borrow checker: there was a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/beda82ddf1f482f286a8d9af3402626dc56d6fea#diff-966e2bfbe831a658c4a89ea9bad0a12ec9d85d6dbf46318e7bd59f2e297c2946">simple path-and-type-disjointness pass called the "alias checker"</a>.</p><p><b>How is this related to GC?</b></p><p>One way to look at reference counting is as a sort of eager, optimized form of garbage collection that works in the case that you have strictly acyclic data (or can tolerate leaking cycles). And one way to look at the </p><tt>&amp;</tt><p> and </p><tt>&amp;mut</tt><p> reference types in Rust is as a way to <em>further</em> optimize reference counting, all the way down to nothing: if you prove the referent outlives the reference, you can avoid reference counting altogether. Of course the </p><tt>&amp;</tt><p> and </p><tt>&amp;mut</tt><p> reference types do other things too -- for example they let you abstract over the difference between reference-counted heap allocation pointers and pointers to the interior of the stack or other objects -- but to a first approximation, when people call these references (and the supporting alias-and-later-borrow-checking pass) "compile-time garbage collection" that is not too far from the point. Strong local reasoning support just comes along for the ride.</p><p>Conversely, languages that <em>have</em> a GC have unfortunately often not felt it necessary to bother having strong local reasoning support. Java for example has a GC and also uncontrolled mutable aliasing, so weak local reasoning and consequently more-challenging formal verification. If you write to an object in Java every other variable referencing that object "sees" the change, so any logical formula that held over all those variables might be invalidated by the write unless you use some fancy method of tracking possible write-sets or separating the heap.</p><p><b>Didn't Rust once have a full, tracing, not-just-reference-counting GC?</b></p><p>Yep! Rust had reference counting with a backup tracing GC on <em>part</em> of its memory graph in order to help support the use case of modeling the DOM in a web browser, which was considered an important use case by some early Mozilla reviewers. As it happened, we couldn't get the tracing part performing well enough to take over from the reference counting part entirely, and also people weren't using these shared pointer types as much in idiomatic Rust as they were using the unique pointer types. So we removed the tracing GC from the shared-mutable type, and then eventually pushed both the unique pointer (Box) and shared pointer (Rc and Arc) types <em>and</em> a mutable-cell type (RefCell) into the standard library.</p><p>What's important to understand is that, as with Rust's Rc type today, the shared pointer graph in Rust-with-a-GC was not responsible for the whole pointer graph. It statically differentiated "shared and immutable" parts of the memory graph from the "shared and mutable" parts, and put the shared-and-mutable stuff behind runtime borrow checks to prevent simultaneous mutable aliasing with </p><tt>&amp;</tt><p> references. Essentially it functioned like </p><tt>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</tt><p> today does, which an attentive reader will note can still be tied into reference-cycles, and lacking a GC such a cycle will now just leak! So just imagine that type, but with a cycle collector attached to it automatically by the language runtime to prevent leaks, and a little syntax sugar. You could revive this today if you wanted, and there are even a few Rust libraries that do.</p><p><b>Wait, does that mean <tt>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</tt> is a mutable alias?</b></p><p>It's fair to view it that way! You can also look at unsafe Rust as a way to get mutable aliasing. Arguably so is access to stuff outside the program's memory, such as performing IO against a shared filesystem or whatever; at least if you were trying to do automated reasoning about such things. The main difference with other languages is in the <em>ubiquity</em> of such problematic mutable aliases. The typical Rust program has either no refcells, or a very small number, just as it has either no unsafe code or a very small amount; so it's easier to reason about them as a special case and, say, exclude them from the variables being analyzed or develop <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08372">specialized rules for them</a>.</p><p>Moreover the RefCell type does a dynamic check for the shared-xor-mutable rule, so <em>from the perspective of the borrow checker in particular</em> it's safe (and sound) to assume any execution that actually occurs (i.e. that does not panic) upholds the rule. But from the perspective of a different verifier looking at different properties then yes, a formula that includes an </p><tt>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</tt><p> might be invalidated by a write to some other </p><tt>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;</tt><p> pointing to the same value, which might defeat formal verification of the properties of interest.</p><p>In fact early versions of Rust didn't support this sort of thing <em>at all</em>. It made all shared-mutable allocations Copy-on-Write, so writing to a shared-mutable allocation made the write private, the other observers of the shared allocation would continue to see the old value. This is a fairly common design choice for languages trying to maintain local reasoning while accepting the need to do mutation sometimes. Rust copied it from a fairly old language called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsqueak">Newsqueak</a>, but you will see it also in newer languages like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)">Swift</a>. Unfortunately like pure-functional programming, it's something users of lower-level systems languages tend to reject due to both its unpredictable performance and the fact that some programs really do <em>want</em> some small amounts of mutable aliasing.</p><p><b>How is this related to threading?</b></p><p>Threading in the presence of mutable aliasing usually makes formal verification much harder; or put another way it makes local reasoning much less plausible than just "normal" sequential mutable aliasing. Now you don't just have variable assignments invalidating logical formulas, you have <em>everything that a concurrent thread might write to</em> potentially being invalidated <em>at any time</em>. A lot of formal verification tools limit themselves to a single-threaded model of the language they're working with.</p><p><b>Is this why Rust has Fearless Concurrency (tm)?</b></p><p>To an extent. Rust built up a lot of machinery to restrict the ways concurrent threads can interact in order both to make multithreaded programming in Rust less error-prone in general, but <em>also</em> to just preserve the local reasoning required by its "lightweight formal verification" passes, mentioned above, specifically the borrow checker. The borrow checker couldn't rely on anything if it was racing with other threads everywhere. Neither could typestate.</p><p>Again, thinking about analogies to GC, this is in some ways similar to how runtime automatic memory management -- refcounting or tracing GC -- often has to work harder in the presence of threads, with write barriers or collection restarts or atomic operations or such.</p><p>Earlier versions of Rust didn't actually support multiple threads touching the same memory at all. It was trying to be an Actor Language, so limited communication to messages sent over channels, and leveraged the Copy-on-Write machinery to make shallow copies of messages sent between tasks in the same thread, and deep copies when sending between threads.</p><p><b>Phew, that is a lot of notes</b></p><p>Yeah, this is paraphrasing a bunch from earlier conversations but I've wanted to write about it publicly for a long time. Thanks Boats for the motivation!</p></div></div>]]></description>

Figuring that out was a very interesting discussion that warrants a retrospective, to look at which parts were particularly helpful and which not so much.</p>
<p>Tangentially, I want to highlight that Axel’s comparison is notable because he is interested in <em>efficiency</em>, not mere brute performance. The two are usually correlated but not always the same. He correctly noted that electricity is a major <em>and increasingly large</em> part of server costs (see <a href="https://wadetregaskis.com/the-cost-of-electrical-power-in-servers/" data-wpel-link="internal">my prior post</a> for why it’s even worse than you likely realise). That said, while he did take RAM and power measurements, his benchmark and analysis didn’t go into detail about energy efficiency.</p>
<h2><span id="Benchmark_method_apparatus">Benchmark method &amp; apparatus</span></h2>
<p>Alex wanted to see how a very simple web server performed in:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.fpm.php" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">FPM</a> w/ <a href="https://www.nginx.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">NGINX</a> (PHP).</li>
<li><a href="https://helidon.io/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Helidon</a> (Kotlin).</li>
<li><a href="https://nodejs.org/en" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Node.js</a> (JavaScript).</li>
<li><a href="https://vapor.codes/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Vapor</a> (Swift).</li>
</ul>
<p>He was particularly interested in throughput &amp; latency vs RAM &amp; power usage. All are important metrics in their own right, but are most useful in light of each other.</p>
<p>He chose to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Fibonacci sequence</a> calculation as the load. Choosing a load for any web server benchmark is always highly contentious, and not the focus of this post. Whether you think Fibonacci’s a good choice or not, read on to see why really it didn’t matter.</p>
<div><p>☝️ People get hung up on how well benchmarks represent the so-called real world, but I think that’s often fruitless to argue about and also beside the point. What matters is whether the benchmark is <em>useful</em>. e.g. does it <em>inform</em> and <em>elucidate</em>?</p></div><p>He did use <em>very</em> old hardware, though – an Intel Core i3-550 from over a decade ago. Fortunately it didn’t turn out to materially impact the relative results nor behaviours of the benchmark, but it’s usually unwise to add unnecessary [potential] variables to your setup, like unusual hardware.</p>
<p>In my own debugging and profiling, I used my also very old 10-core iMac Pro. It’s at least a Xeon? 😅</p>
<h2><span id="Benchmark_results">Benchmark results</span></h2>
<p>In words:</p>
<ul>
<li>Helidon (Kotlin) had the highest throughput and lowest latency at low (and arguably more reasonable) loads, but used by far the most RAM, and the most power. Consequently it handled the most load before requests started failing (timing out).</li>
<li>Node.js (JavaScript) was qualitatively very similar to Helidon (Kotlin) but less in all metrics – less throughput, less peak load capacity, but also less RAM and very slightly less power used.</li>
<li>FPM + NGINX (PHP) followed the pattern.</li>
<li>Vapor (Swift) did not – it had higher throughput than PHP yet requests started failing much sooner as load increased. It used the least RAM and least power, though, and kept on trucking irrespective of the load.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many people would have left it at that – obviously the results make sense for the first three (“everyone knows” that Kotlin’s faster than JavaScript that’s faster than PHP) and Vapor / Swift apparently just isn’t fast and has weird reliability behaviours. QED, right?</p>
<div><p>⚠️ Going in with a specific hypothesis can be helpful, but hypotheses can also end up being just biases. Be careful not to blindly accept apparent confirmation of the hypothesis. Similarly, beware subconscious hypotheses like “Kotlin is faster than JavaScript”.</p></div><p>To his credit, Axel wasn’t so sure – he felt that the results he was seeing were suspicious, and <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/standard-vapor-website-drops-1-5-of-requests-even-at-concurrency-of-100/71583" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">he sought help from the Swift Forums</a> in explaining or correcting them.</p>
<div> <p>✅ Question your results. <em>Understand</em> them. It improves the quality, correctness, and usefulness of your work. <em>Why</em> something behaves the way it does is often more interesting and important than merely how it behaves.</p> <p>On most platforms it’s pretty easy to at least do a time profile, and most often that’s all you need to understand what’s going on. On Apple platforms you can use <a href="https://www.avanderlee.com/debugging/xcode-instruments-time-profiler/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Instruments</a>, on Windows &amp; Linux tools like <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/vtune-profiler/user-guide/2024-1/basic-hotspots-analysis.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">VTune</a>, among <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_performance_analysis_tools" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">many other options</a>.</p> <p>If need be, ask others for help, like Axel did.</p></div><p>While Axel did <em>suspect</em> something was wrong – noting the oddly small but persistent failure rate – he missed the most obvious <em>proof</em> of wrongness – logically impossible results. Doing 80,000 continuous concurrent streams of requests with ~98% of those requests completing within the two second time limit means the server must have a throughput of at least 39,000 requests per second. Yet the benchmark tool reported a mere ~8,000 requests per second.</p>
<p>Sadly, though <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/standard-vapor-website-drops-1-5-of-requests-even-at-concurrency-of-100/71583/2" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">I pointed this out as the very first response to the thread</a>, it seemed to be overlooked by everyone (even myself!), even though it clearly fingered the benchmark tool itself as the problem (which is only partially correct, as we’ll see later, but in any case was the exact right place to start looking).</p>
<h2><span id="Debugging_the_benchmark">Debugging the benchmark</span></h2>
<h2><span id="Domain_experts_weigh_in">Domain experts weigh in</span></h2>
<p>The Swift Forum post immediately attracted relevant people: folks that work on Vapor and NIO, and folks that have experience using them. However, ironically this didn’t initially help – they tended to assume the problem was in Vapor (or its networking library, <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-nio" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">SwiftNIO</a>) or how Vapor was being configured. It turned out none of this was really true – there <em>was</em> <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/standard-vapor-website-drops-1-5-of-requests-even-at-concurrency-of-100/71583/49" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">a small optimisation made to Vapor</a> as a result of all this, which did marginally improve performance (in specific circumstances), but ultimately Vapor &amp; NIO were not the problem, nor was the benchmark’s configuration and use of them.</p>
<div> <p>⚠️ It can be all too easy to assume elaborate reasons when you know a lot about something. Don’t jump to conclusions. Check the most basic and foundational things <em>first</em>.</p> <p>I say this with humility and I guess technically hypocrisy, because even as professional performance engineer (in the past) I’ve repeatedly made this mistake myself. We’re all particularly susceptible to this mistake.</p></div><p>There were some assertions that the results <em>were</em> plausible and just how Vapor performs, and that the “problem” was the choice of Vapor rather than some other web server framework (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/hummingbird-project/hummingbird" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Hummingbird</a>).</p>
<div><p>⚠️ It’s not <em>wrong</em> to be interested in additional data, but be careful not to get distracted. Using Vapor was not in any way wrong or unhelpful – it is the most well-known and probably well-used web server framework in Swift. It might well be that other frameworks are better in some respects, but that’s a <em>different</em> comparison than what Axel performed.</p></div><p>Others similarly asserted that the results were plausible because Swift uses <a href="https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/automaticreferencecounting/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">reference-counting</a> for memory management whereas PHP, JavaScript, and Kotlin use garbage collection. It was presented as “common knowledge” that garbage collection has inherent benefits for some programs, like web servers, because it makes memory allocation super cheap.</p>
<div> <p>⚠️ While it can be useful to speculate a little, in a brainstorming sense, don’t presume. A <em>lot</em> of mistakes have been made over the years because of this, like that “linked lists are faster than arrays” or “binary search is faster than linear search”, etc.</p> <p>Remember that intuition is in large part presumptions and generalisations. That doesn’t make intuition useless, but always remember that it’s far from foolproof. Use it to generate hypotheses, not conclusions.</p></div><h2><span id="Examining_the_load">Examining the load</span></h2>
<p>Even though it was clear that something was wrong with the actual measurements, a lot of the early discussion revolved around the load used (Fibonacci sequence calculation), particularly regarding whether it was:</p>
<h3><span id="The_8220right8221_load">The “right” load</span></h3>
<p>A few folks asserted that the CPU-heavy nature of calculating Fibonacci numbers isn’t representative of web servers generally. Multiple people noted that – in the Swift implementation, at least – the majority of the CPU time was spent doing the Fibonacci calculation. Some felt this was therefore not a useful benchmark of Vapor itself.</p>
<p>A lot of this boiled down to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">the “no true Scotsman” problem</a>, which is very common in benchmarking, with a bit of perfect world logical fallacy peppered in, trying to identify the One True Representative Benchmark. See the earlier point about fixating on such matters rather than whether the benchmark is <em>useful</em>.</p>
<div> <p>⚠️ While it’s not necessarily wrong or unwise to evaluate how well a benchmark represents real world usage (whether generally or against specific cases), it’s an exercise that suffers from diminishing returns pretty quickly. It’s usually best to not quibble too much or too long, as long as the benchmark is in the ballpark.</p> <p>You can always develop &amp; present your own benchmark(s), if you feel there are better or additional ways to go about it. Best of all, the existence of <em>both</em> the original benchmark and your benchmark(s) will be more useful than either alone, since you can compare and contrast them.</p></div><h3><span id="A_8220fair8221_load">A “fair” load</span></h3>
<p>Accusations were made pretty quickly that the benchmark is “unfair” to Swift because Swift doesn’t – it was asserted – have a properly-optimised “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">BigInt</a>” implementation, unlike all the other languages tested.</p>
<p>No real evidence was given for this.  Even if it were true, it doesn’t invalidate the benchmark – in fact, it just makes the benchmark <em>more</em> successful because it’s then highlighted an area where Swift is lacking.</p>
<p>The BigInt library that Axel used, <a href="https://github.com/attaswift/BigInt" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">attaswift/BigInt</a>, is by far the most popular available for Swift, as judged by things like GitHub stars, forks, &amp; contributor counts, ranking in web &amp; GitHub searches, etc. There are <a href="https://swiftpackageindex.com/search?query=bigint" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">quite a few others</a>, though.</p>
<div> <p>☝️ There are multiple ways to approach a benchmark, all equally valid because they’re all useful. Axel chose to use popular packages, in <em>all</em> the languages he tested. That’s definitely fair. It’s also useful because it represents what the typical developer will do when building real web servers.</p> <p>It’s often also interesting and useful to search out the <em>best</em> packages (whatever that may mean in context, such as fastest). That could represent what a more heavily optimised implementation might do. It <em>might</em> also better represent what is theoretical possible (<em>if</em> optimal packages exist already). Those are interesting things to explore too, just not what Axel happened to be doing.</p> <p>You can see also more of my thoughts on Axel’s choice here, <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/standard-vapor-website-drops-1-5-of-requests-even-at-concurrency-of-100/71583/39" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">in the Swift Forums thread</a>.</p></div><p>It wasn’t until <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/standard-vapor-website-drops-1-5-of-requests-even-at-concurrency-of-100/71583/46" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">actual evidence was presented</a>, that the discussion made progress.</p>
<div> <p>⚠️ While it’s true that without the initial blind assertions, actual data might never have been gathered, it would have been more effective and efficient to have just gathered the data at the start.</p> <p>Data is better than supposition.</p></div><p>It was shown that in fact the BigInt implementation in question <em>was</em> significantly slower than it could be, because JavaScript’s implementation of addition was much faster. <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/standard-vapor-website-drops-1-5-of-requests-even-at-concurrency-of-100/71583/62" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Some additional simple tests</a> showed even wider performance gaps regarding the other key operation: rendering to strings.

So I had a pretty darn good idea of where I might find a faster package… 😆</p>
<p>You can read more about that specific bit of serendipity <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/standard-vapor-website-drops-1-5-of-requests-even-at-concurrency-of-100/71583/64" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">in the Swift Forums thread</a>.</p>
<p>It was trivial to do the package switch, and it quickly improved Vapor/Swift’s showing in the benchmark manyfold – in combination with some other simple and reasonable tweaks, it was <em>five times faster</em>!</p>
<div>
<p>✅ Axel’s benchmark taught a lot of people that <a href="https://github.com/oscbyspro/Numberick" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Numberick</a> is much more performant than <a href="https://github.com/attaswift/BigInt" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">BigInt</a>, at least in some important operations (addition and string rendering). Granted that knowledge is a little bit niche in its utility, but it’s still a good outcome.</p>
<p>It also demonstrated that modifying in place can be faster than creating a copy, <em>even if</em> it means having to do a swap. i.e.:</p>
<p>…instead of:</p>
<div data-code-block-pro-font-family=""><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>let</span><span> c = a + b</span></span>
<span><span>a = b</span></span>
<span><span>b = c</span></span></code></pre></div><p>That’s a tidbit I had picked up through varied experiences, and <a href="https://wadetregaskis.com/swift-tip-the-swap-function/" data-wpel-link="internal">wrote about previously</a>. The <code><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/swap(_:_:)" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">swap</a></code> function in Swift is under-appreciated and under-utilised. This knowledge may seem esoteric but you’d be amazed how often it applies (a <em>lot</em> of programming is about combining data, after all).</p></div><p>Axel posted <a href="https://tech.phlux.us/Juice-Sucking-Servers-Part-Deux/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">a follow-up with additional data</a> (with the aforementioned changes and optimisations). That showed Swift now beating out the other three frameworks / languages, with the highest throughput and lowest latency (and still the lowest RAM and power usage).</p>

<p>That is yet to be examined. Because only Swift seemed to be producing odd results, Axel only put the benchmark to the Swift community for deeper analysis. It’s quite possible that doing the same with the other web frameworks &amp; languages would similarly reveal potential improvements.</p>
<p>Still, the results are useful as they stand. Some simple and very plausible – even for a Swift beginner – optimisations made a big difference, though of course the biggest difference was simply using a different 3rd party package. There are a lot of useful lessons in that, both in the specifics as already covered and as general best practices.</p>
<div> <p>☝️ Benchmarks are rarely “done”, their results rarely “final”. At least if you permit optimisations or other changes. How do you <em>know</em> there’s not something still “unfair” about one of the cases?</p> <p>Again, this speaks to the potential futility of trying to make “fair” benchmarks, and reiterates the practical benefit of simply trying to learn instead.</p></div><h2><span id="but_why_is_the_success_rate_still_weird">…but… why is the success rate still weird?</span></h2>

<p>Despite all the community’s efforts, we hadn’t actually figured out the real problem. We’d merely made Swift <em>look</em> better, without actually providing confidence in the accuracy of the results.</p>
<p>In fairness to myself, I was well aware that we weren’t done, I was just struggling to understand what was really going on, <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/standard-vapor-website-drops-1-5-of-requests-even-at-concurrency-of-100/71583/74" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">as I noted here</a>.</p>
<h2><span id="Examining_the_benchmark_tool">Examining the benchmark tool</span></h2>
<p>While there’d been some tangential questions about <code><a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">wrk</a></code>, the benchmarking tool Axel used, it had largely been ignored thus far.</p>
<p>Ironically (as you’ll soon see) Axel chose <code>wrk</code> specifically because <a href="https://tech.phlux.us/Juice-Sucking-Servers/#benchmarking-software" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">he didn’t like the behaviour he saw</a> with <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/ab.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">ApacheBench</a>. Mostly its lack of HTTP/1.1 connection reuse (a subjective but valid methodology choice on Axel’s part) but also because it sounds like he saw some inexplicable results from it too. In hindsight, that might have been a clue that something more pervasive was wrong.</p>
<p>In retrospect there were a few tangential comments in the Swift Forums thread that were on the right track, e.g.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…when a new connection comes in, the server needs to make a decision: It can</p>
<ul>
<li>Either accept the new connection immediately, slowing the existing connections down a little (because now there are more connections to service with the same resources as before)</li>
<li>Or it can prioritise the existing connections and slow the connection acceptance (increasing the latency of the first request in the new connection which now has to wait).</li>
</ul>

<p>As a little spoiler, it seems apparent that the other three web frameworks all accept incoming connections virtually immediately with priority over any existing connections &amp; request handling (even though they don’t necessarily attempt to <em>serve</em> all those connections’ requests simultaneously). Vapor does not.</p>
<p>Suspicions did [correctly] develop around the opening of the connections themselves, which triggered testing with longer timeouts in a somewhat blind attempt to cover-up the “spurious” first moments of the test.</p>
<div><p>❌ Trying to essentially just hide inconvenient results is unlikely to help.

<p>Though admittedly I wasn’t <em>fully</em> conscious of what I was doing at the time, the next breakthrough came from simply <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/standard-vapor-website-drops-1-5-of-requests-even-at-concurrency-of-100/71583/85" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">gathering more data and analysing it <em>qualitatively</em></a>. This helped in two key ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>It better defined and pinned down the circumstances in which things appear to go wrong with the benchmark itself.<p>It separated out a whole bunch of test configurations that seemingly weren’t interesting (as they behaved in line with intuition / expectations, and similarly across all four web servers).</p></li>
</ul>
<div><p>✅ When it doubt, try to better define the problem. Eliminate variables. Refine quantitative estimates. Make your life easier by eliminating things that don’t matter.</p></div><ul>
<li>It provided hints and potential insight into the nature of the problem.<p>It showed that there was some kind of variability (in time) in the benchmark’s behaviour, with three very distinct modes (including one which was basically the benchmark actually working as expected, the existence of which had been unknown until that point!).</p></li>
</ul>
<div><p>✅ There are <em>many</em> ways to approach a data set, in terms of analysis methods.

I took that as affirmation that I was onto something real, but in retrospect that should have been an even better clue:  the fact that some people had seen this issue <em>without</em> Vapor involved – the only common denominator was NIO.  Even though it turns out NIO itself wasn’t doing any wrong, it was on the right path to answers.  <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/standard-vapor-website-drops-1-5-of-requests-even-at-concurrency-of-100/71583/87" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">This was <em>specifically</em> pointed out to everyone</a>, even.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don’t test with more than 128 connections. You will get read errors. This is due to the file descriptor limit applied to each process on macOS. As&nbsp;<a href="https://forums.swift.org/u/johannesweiss" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">@johannesweiss</a>&nbsp;mentioned earlier the default for this is 256.

<p>The 128 connections &amp; read errors parts were spot on, in hindsight.  But the rest was incorrect (it’s not about the file descriptor ulimit) and in particular the incorrect statement about having to disable SIP perhaps further distracted readers (corrections were posted in reply, which perhaps steered the thread away from what actually mattered).</p>
<p>I’m not sure what precisely the lesson is here… if Adam had better understood the behaviour he’d seen previously (re. 128 connections being the apparent limit) he might have been able to immediately point out one of the key problems.  But who can say why he didn’t quite understand that limit correctly, or whether he should have.  This sort of thing happens, and <em>maybe</em> it suggests a failure to properly diagnose problems previously, but mostly I’d just point out that the discrepancy here – between 128 and 256 – <em>should</em> have been noticed, and had it been questioned it would have accelerated progress towards the root cause.</p>
<p>Speaking just for myself, I think I (erroneously) dismissed Adam’s comment because I already knew that the default file descriptor limit is <em>not</em> actually 256 (it’s 2,560 on macOS, mostly) and so I assumed the <em>whole</em> comment was wrong and irrelevant.</p>
<div><p>⚠️ Partly wrong is not the same as completely wrong (let-alone useless).</p></div><p>Another clue was put forth, yet again essentially by accident (without understanding its significance, at the time):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, the reason I used&nbsp;<code>wrk</code>, is that it uses pipelining. That’s why ab (apachebench) had such terrible performance: it opened a new socket for each request. And then it overloaded the system by throwing</p>

<li><code>apr_socket_recv: Connection reset by peer&nbsp;</code></li>

<p>This hinted very directly at the second major problem, but it seems nobody in the forum thread realised it.  I think there was still a pre-occupation with the file descriptor ulimit.</p>
<p>A little logic applied at the time of Axel’s comment <em>should</em> have revealed its mistaken presumption: that opening new TCP connections for each HTTP request will inevitably cause connection failures.  Sure, it will if you give it enough concurrent connection attempts, but real-world web servers operate at <em>huge</em> loads that are basically one HTTP request per connection, without any significant reliability problems.  In hindsight, it’s clear that Axel’s dismissal of this behaviour as in any way normal was a mistake – as was everyone else in the thread going along with that dismissal.</p>
<div><p>⚠️ If a tool isn’t working the way you expect, maybe that’s telling you something important. Just switching tools until you find one which doesn’t exhibit the problem doesn’t necessarily mean it’s not still a problem.</p></div><h3><span id="A_misunderstood_workaround">A misunderstood workaround</span></h3>
<p>In parallel to all of the above discussion in the Swift Forums thread, I’d been diving into <code>wrk</code> to see what it was really doing.  I discovered <em>a way</em> to eliminate the errors: by opening all the TCP connections in advance in a way that <em>happened</em> to limit how many were attempted concurrently by <code>wrk</code> thread count which <em>happened</em> to be low enough in my use of <code>wrk</code> to not hit the magic 128 limit (more on that later).  As you can see in <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/standard-vapor-website-drops-1-5-of-requests-even-at-concurrency-of-100/71583/123" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">my forum post on this</a>, I initially misunderstood how <code>wrk</code> functioned and misattributed the root cause as bugs / bad design in <code>wrk</code>.</p>
<p>In my defence, <code>wrk</code> isn’t written very well, eschewing such outrageous and bourgeois software engineering practices as, you know, actually checking for errors.  So it wasn’t unreasonable to believe it was ultimately just broken, given plenty of evidence that it was at least partly broken (which it was &amp; is), but it was ultimately a mistake to let that cloud my judgement of each individual behaviour.</p>
<p>Then again, if I hadn’t been so appalled by the bad code in <code>wrk</code>, and taken it upon myself to rewrite key parts of it, I might not have stumbled onto the above “fix” and therefore also not found the true cause, later.</p>
<div><p>✅ Improving error handling &amp; reporting is practically always a good idea. And when debugging a problem it can be helpful even if it doesn’t feel guided – the whole point of absent or incorrect error reporting is that you don’t know what you’re missing, so you may well reveal an important clue “by accident”.</p></div><h3><span id="It8217s_never_the_compiler_or_the_kernel_except_when_it_is">It’s never the compiler or the kernel… except when it is</span></h3>
<p>At the time I did think I’d actually <em>fixed</em> <code>wrk</code>; I didn’t realise I’d merely found an imperfect workaround.  I’d solved the connection errors (not really)!  But, I was still curious about one thing – something pretty much everyone had kinda ignored this whole time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though those lingering few read/write errors still bother me. I might look into them later.</p>
<cite>Me, <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/standard-vapor-website-drops-1-5-of-requests-even-at-concurrency-of-100/71583/123" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Swift Forums thread</a></cite></blockquote>
<p>Tracing those reported errors to their cause was quite a challenge.  The only known way to reproduce the errors was to use a very high number of concurrent TCP connections (several thousand), which made it hard to follow any <em>single</em> connection through its lifecycle using any low-brow methods (printf debugging etc).  <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/standard-vapor-website-drops-1-5-of-requests-even-at-concurrency-of-100/71583/129" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">I eventually managed</a> using System Trace<sup data-fn="65590619-a219-4fb0-87ea-fd2c98990365"><a href="#65590619-a219-4fb0-87ea-fd2c98990365" id="65590619-a219-4fb0-87ea-fd2c98990365-link">1</a></sup> (lamenting, the entire time I used Instruments, that it would have been <a href="https://leopard-adc.pepas.com/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/SharkUserGuide/SystemTracing/SystemTracing.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">so much easier in Shark</a>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, what I was seeing – while in fact correct – did not make sense to me, so I was hesitant to take it on face value.</p>
<p>The lack of any error reporting on the server side, because Vapor lacks it completely, was also both a known problem at the time and also a problem in hindsight.  Had Vapor/NIO actually reported the errors they were encountering, it would have partially validated what I was seeing in the system traces – in fact, it would probably have saved me from having to capture &amp; analyse system traces.</p>
<div><p>❌ Ignoring errors is always a bad idea. I mean, duh, right? But apparently it has to be reiterated.</p></div><p>Alas I don’t actually remember now precisely what led me to the final answers and root causes.  I know it involved many hours of experimenting, exploring hypotheses, and in generally fiddling with everything I could think of.</p>
<p>Somehow or other, I did finally cotton on to a key configuration parameter:  <code>kern.ipc.somaxconn</code>.</p>
<p>That controls how many connection requests can be pending (not formally accepted by the server) at one time.  It defaults to 128 on macOS.  Remember that number, 128?</p>
<p>Once I had figured out that <code>kern.ipc.somaxconn</code> directly controlled the problematic behaviour, the rest followed pretty naturally and quickly – I realised that what I saw in the system traces was in fact accurate, and that in turn revealed that the macOS kernel contains multiple surprisingly blatant and serious bugs (or at the very least dubious design choices, and lying documentation) regarding TCP sockets in non-blocking mode.  I wrote that up in some detail in the second half of <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/standard-vapor-website-drops-1-5-of-requests-even-at-concurrency-of-100/71583/132" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">this Swift Forums post</a>.</p>
<p>As a sidenote, that darn magic number that everyone kept ignoring – 128 – cropped up yet again, in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man2/listen.2.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">the <code>listen</code> man page</a>, though by the time I saw it there it was merely a confirmation of what I’d already discovered, than a helpful clue.

<p>All told, the major problems identified by the benchmark were (and not all of these were mentioned above, but you can find all the details in <a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/standard-vapor-website-drops-1-5-of-requests-even-at-concurrency-of-100/71583" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">the Swift Forums thread</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>The particular 3rd party library used for BigInt support in Swift, <a href="https://github.com/attaswift/BigInt" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">attaswift/BigInt</a>, performs quite poorly.</li>
<li>Vapor would accept too few connections per cycle of its event loop (promptly fixed, in <a href="https://github.com/vapor/vapor/releases/tag/4.96.0" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">4.96.0</a>).</li>
<li>The benchmark tool used, <code><a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">wrk</a></code>, has numerous bugs:
<ul>
<li>It doesn’t always use the configured number of concurrent connections.</li>
<li>It doesn’t measure latency correctly.</li>
<li>It doesn’t report errors correctly (in the sense both that it miscategorises them, e.g. connect vs read/write, and that it doesn’t provide enough detail to understand what they are, such as by including the errno).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The macOS kernel (and seemingly Linux kernel likewise) has multiple bugs:
<ul>
<li>Connection errors are reported incorrectly (as <code>ECONNRESET</code> or <code>EBADF</code>, instead of <code>ECONNREFUSED</code>).</li>
<li>kqueue (kevents) behaves as if all connections are always accepted, even when they are not. Put another way, you cannot actually tell if a connection was successful when using non-blocking sockets on macOS.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Key network configuration on macOS &amp; Linux is way too restrictive:
<ul>
<li>Maximum file descriptors per process is only 2,560 generally on macOS, and even less (256) in GUI apps. It may vary on Linux, but on Axel’s particular server it was 1,024.</li>
<li>Maximum number of unaccepted connection requests (the <code>kern.ipc.somaxconn</code> sysctl on macOS, <code>/proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn</code> on Linux) is only 128 on macOS.  It may vary on Linux.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It <em>appears</em> that the kernel bugs apply to Linux as well (although it’s not known if kqueue was in use there, as <code>wrk</code> also supports <code>epoll</code> and <code>select</code>), as the behaviour seems to be the same there, but I didn’t test that myself and it’s not completely clear from Axel’s posts.  Also, Axel has not yet done a follow-up with the final fixes &amp; workarounds, to confirm that they do fully fix the benchmark’s results.</p>
<p>And that’s just the <em>problems</em> – there was a whole host of interesting lessons taken away from all this (only a fraction of which were highlighted in this post – many more can be found in Axel’s posts and the Swift Forums thread).</p>
<p>Nominally the end result is also a benchmark that shows Vapor (Swift) out-performing other popular web frameworks in other languages.  <em>Hugely</em> out-performing them, if you factor in not just throughput &amp; latency but RAM &amp; power usage.  But, to reiterate <a href="#do-these-improvements-apply-to-the-other-cases-too">what I pointed out earlier</a>, take that with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>So, for a benchmark that many initially decried as unrealistic or plain poorly conceived, it turned out to be pretty darn useful, I think.  And if that doesn’t make it a successful benchmark, I don’t know what does.</p>

        <p>In 2016, Olympus Camera made some buzz in the photo world when they <a href="https://petapixel.com/2016/09/26/olympus-says-earths-rotation-limits-image-stabilization-6-5-stops-max/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed</a> that their new camera was capable of an impressive 6.5 stops of stabilization and that the limiting factor was in fact the rotation of the Earth.&nbsp; This was rather surprising given the slow and steady improvement since the first such stabilization systems were introduced in lenses in the 1990s.&nbsp; These only provided a couple stops of benefit.&nbsp; Since then the technology has improved dramatically and the move from film to silicon has allowed it to be incorporated into the camera itself as IBIS.</p>
<p>A major driver of this increase in stabilization performance has been in the gyroscopic sensors used to measure the vibration and control electronics used to correct it.&nbsp; For these types of applications, the accuracy of the <a href="https://www.analog.com/en/analog-dialogue/raqs/raq-issue-139.html#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zero offset of the gyro sensor is often the limiting factor</a>.&nbsp; Even when perfectly still, noise will cause the sensor to read a small but non-zero value, which will in turn cause the stabilization system to drift.&nbsp; The smaller the drift, the longer the stabilization system can hold an image steady.&nbsp; If there were no noise on the gyro sensor and the stabilization system worked perfectly, it should in theory be able to provide an infinite number of stops of benefit.&nbsp; However, at somewhere around 6 stops of shutter speed increase, the limiting factor stops becoming the electronics, and instead becomes the rotational motion of the Earth!</p>
<p>To illustrate , lets imagine that you are somewhere on the Earth’s surface, pointing the camera due East or West.&nbsp; For simplicity, lets assume you are on the equator, but your latitude doesn’t actually matter for this analysis.&nbsp; There are 86,400 seconds in a day, so Earth rotates at a rate of 2π/86400 radians/second, or 7.27*10^-5 rad/s.&nbsp; That means that your subject, which is presumably stationary on Earth’s surface as well, is rotating at this rate.&nbsp; Your camera, which is using its IBIS system to attempt to keep everything as still as possible, may not realize that you are rotating with your subject and will instead try to zero out <em>any&nbsp;</em>rotation of the camera, including that of the Earth.&nbsp; More technically, the camera is trying to maintain stability with respect to an inertial reference frame, which by virtue of the Earth’s rotation, you and your subject are not.</p>
<figure id="attachment_3861" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3861"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://thecentercolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/EarthIBIS.png" alt="" width="840" height="442" srcset="https://thecentercolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/EarthIBIS.png 971w, https://thecentercolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/EarthIBIS-300x158.png 300w, https://thecentercolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/EarthIBIS-768x404.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3861">As the Earth rotates during the exposure, a basic IS system will try to maintain the pointing of the camera as if it were in an inertial frame or reference. If the camera is pointed east, this will cause it to gradually point up compared to the subject, which is not on an inertial frame.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The camera will of course move with the Earth and your subject, but will rotate relative to the subject.&nbsp; If the camera is pointed east as shown in the figure above, it will rotate up relative to the subject.</p>
<p>Lets say that you have an exposure time given by the variable T.&nbsp; IBIS will therefore cause the image to move by a distance on the sensor given by:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=FocalLength+%5Ctimes+T+%5Ctimes+7.27%2A10%5E-5&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="FocalLength \times T \times 7.27*10^-5" title="FocalLength \times T \times 7.27*10^-5"></p>
<p>Using our typical standard for the maximum allowable blur to be 1 pixel width, we get the maximum allowable shutter time to be</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7BFocal+Length%7D%5Cfrac%7BPixelWidth%7D%7B7.27e%5E%7B-5%7D%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="T = \frac{1}{Focal Length}\frac{PixelWidth}{7.27e^{-5}}" title="T = \frac{1}{Focal Length}\frac{PixelWidth}{7.27e^{-5}}"></p>
<p>A 24 megapixel full frame camera will have pixels that are 0.0059mm wide.&nbsp; Plugging this into the above equation, we get</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=T+%3D+%5Cfrac%7B81%7D%7BFocal+Length%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="T = \frac{81}{Focal Length}" title="T = \frac{81}{Focal Length}"></p>
<p>If we take 1/Focal Length as the standard advice for the maximum shutter speed you can use to achieve sharp images, this equation says we can use shutter speeds 81 times as long with stabilization before Earth’s rotation blurs the image by one pixel.&nbsp; In more familiar terms:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=log_%7B2%7D%2881%29+%3D+6.3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=000&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" alt="log_{2}(81) = 6.3" title="log_{2}(81) = 6.3"> Stops</p>
<p>Neat.&nbsp; Of course not all cameras have the same 0.0059mm pixel pitch, but the rule for the maximum hand-held shutter speed will vary accordingly, so this 6.3 stops will be consistent across most cameras.&nbsp; We can turn this around and say that in order to provide 6.3 stops of stabilization, the system must be able to measure and compensate for rotations of the camera as slow as the Earth’s, or 360 degrees per day.&nbsp; That’s pretty impressive.</p>
<p>Presumably, a calculation like the one above or very similar was the inspiration for the claim by Olympus Camera:</p>
<blockquote><p>“6.5 stops is actually a theoretical limitation at the moment due to rotation of the earth interfering with gyro sensors”</p></blockquote>
<p>Since then the plot has thickened.&nbsp; Olympus has released the OM-D E-M1X which claims to have 7.5 stops of stabilization, and Panasonic <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/news/5492554426/panasonic-s-new-lumix-s-pro-70-200mm-f2-8-offers-up-to-7-stops-of-shake-reduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">claims</a> their new 70-200 f/2.8 has 7 stops of stabilization.&nbsp; How could this be?&nbsp; Without access to the data used to perform the <a href="http://www.cipa.jp/image-stabilization/index_e.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CIPA stabilization rating test</a> for these pieces of equipment, it’s difficult to say for sure.&nbsp; In theory though, there are some possible ways to work around the limitations placed be Earth’s rotation:</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp; Use the camera’s GPS, accelerometer, and compass to calculate exactly where it is pointed and its latitude.&nbsp; With this information you could calculate the necessary offset and program your stabilization system to compensate accordingly.</li>
<li>&nbsp; Use a high pass filter on your stabilization system.&nbsp; The rotation of the Earth is very constant, so if your gyro sensor should measure a small but constant rotation.&nbsp; In comparison, your hands shake the camera all over the place, so an engineer could tell the sensor to only compensate for this later kind of motion.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first isn’t a good solution for many reasons.&nbsp; Don’t have GPS signal?&nbsp; Shooting next to a magnet?&nbsp; Your system won’t work.&nbsp; The second solution is much more plausible, but still very difficult.&nbsp; The user would have to be pointing the camera at the subject for long enough such that the drift in their aim at the subject is smaller than the drift from the rotation of the earth.&nbsp; This is also implausible.&nbsp; What is concerning though, is that this second method is one that could work very well to cancel out Earth’s rotation on the CIPA specified stabilization test apparatus.</p>
<p>For the CIPA stabilization test, the camera is mounted to a vibration platform.&nbsp; The camera is then moved by the platform in a way that is determined by a CIPA provided waveform designed to mimic the motions from hand-holding a camera.&nbsp; The setup is shown below:</p>
<figure id="attachment_3855" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3855"><img decoding="async" src="https://thecentercolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CIPAStabilizationTestSetup.png" alt="" width="478" height="270" srcset="https://thecentercolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CIPAStabilizationTestSetup.png 583w, https://thecentercolumn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CIPAStabilizationTestSetup-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 478px) 100vw, 478px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-3855">CIPA Image Stabilization Test Setup</figcaption></figure>
<p>In this test setup, the camera is mounted to a very stable platform and held there for a long time before and after the test images are being taken.&nbsp; In theory, this could make it much easier to for the camera to identify and filter out any effects from Earth’s rotation.&nbsp; If the waveform has no very low frequency components, it would be easy to identify any low frequency motion as Earth’s rotation.&nbsp; Without knowing exactly what waveform is given to camera manufacturers to perform this test though, it’s impossible to draw any meaningful conclusions.&nbsp; It would be great if we could get some independent verification of the stated stabilization values, but CIPA seems to make that deliberately difficult.&nbsp; As quoted on their <a href="http://www.cipa.jp/image-stabilization/contents_e/guide_e.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">application guide</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The applicant must be a corporate organization.</li>
<li>The applicant must understand that the standard and measurement kit cannot be provided to individuals, universities, or any other parties for research purposes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems unnecessarily restrictive to me and makes independent verification and analysis of the test impossible.</p>
<p>This has been a long way of saying that I don’t know if Olympus and Panasonic have found a way to compensate for the Earth’s rotation in their stabilization systems, breaking through the 6.3 stop limit, or if they are achieving 7+ stops through oddities of the CIPA rating test.&nbsp;&nbsp;If anyone has one of these cameras with 7+ stops of stabilization and some time on their hands, it would be really cool to show the camera breaking through the Earth rotation barrier.&nbsp; If the cameras can’t, and you could show that Earth’s rotation is actually the limiting factor on the stabilization system, well that would be pretty cool too.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="storywrap-438359">


<h3>from the <i>just-build-it-yourself</i> dept</h3>

<p>Tired of being underserved and overbilled by shitty regional broadband monopolies, back in 2002 a coalition of local Utah governments formed <a href="https://www.utopiafiber.com/faqs/">UTOPIA</a> — (the Utah Telecommunication Open Infrastructure Agency). The inter-local agency collaborative venture then set about building an “open access” fiber network that allows any ISP to then come and compete on the shared network. </p>
<p>As we’ve noted over the years, regional monopolies like Qwest (now Centurylink or Lumen) didn’t much like that. They desperately tried to <a href="https://www.deseret.com/2005/7/22/19903471/utopia-responds-to-qwest-lawsuit/">sue and harass the network out of existence</a> in the early aughts, claiming the concept violated numerous local laws (it didn’t). These efforts failed, in part, because of widespread support among a public extremely tired of being ripped off by shitty monopolies. </p>
<p>Two decades later and the coalition <a href="https://www.utopiafiber.com/2024/05/08/utopia-fiber-adds-three-new-residential-internet-service-providers-to-its-open-access-network/">just announced</a> that 18 different ISPs now compete for Utah resident attention over a network that now covers 21 different Utah cities. In many instances, ISPs on the network are offering symmetrical (uncapped) gigabit fiber for as little as $45 a month (plus $30 network connection fee, so $75). Some ISPs are even offering symmetrical <strong>10 Gbps fiber for around $150 a month</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Sumo Fiber, a veteran member of the UTOPIA Open Access Marketplace, is now offering 10 Gbps symmetrical for $119, plus a $30 UTOPIA Fiber infrastructure fee, bringing the total cost to $149 per month.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a collaborative hybrid that blurs the line between private companies and government, and it works. And the prices being offered here are significantly less than locals often pay in highly developed tech-centric urban hubs like New York, San Francisco, or Seattle. </p>
<p>Yet giant local ISPs like Comcast and Qwest spent decades trying to either sue this network into oblivion, or using their proxy policy orgs (like the “<a href="https://mail.communitynets.org/content/utopia-confronts-critics-continues-new-strategy">Utah Taxpayer Association</a>“) to falsely claim this effort would end in chaos and inevitable taxpayer tears. Yet miraculously UTOPIA is profitable, and for the last 15 years, every UTOPIA project has been paid for completely through subscriber revenues.</p>
<p>As other Utah cities have considered following suit, those same local monopolies have created dark money campaigns and even <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/07/12/charters-running-a-fake-consumer-group-in-maine-thats-killing-community-broadband-with-the-help-of-a-democratic-advisor/">fake consumer groups</a> to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/01/18/telecom-monopolies-are-once-again-funding-covert-sleazy-local-attacks-on-community-broadband-networks/">lie to locals that such efforts are still inevitable government boondoggles</a>. Such sleazy lobbying campaigns are cheaper than actually competing or building the kind of networks these locals have spent several decades clamoring for. </p>
<p>For years, real world experience and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2020/12/04/benton-study-again-shows-how-open-access-broadband-networks-can-drive-competition-improve-service/">several</a> different <a href="https://transition.fcc.gov/stage/pdf/Berkman_Center_Broadband_Study_13Oct09.pdf">studies</a> and reports (including see our <a href="https://copia.is/library/just-a-click-away/">Copia study on this concept</a>) have made it clear that open access networks and policies result in faster, better, more affordable broadband access. UTOPIA is proving it at scale, but numerous other municipalities have been following suit with the help of COVID relief and infrastructure bill funding. </p>
<p>Sometimes such networks are owned by local governments. Sometimes they’re community-owned cooperatives. Sometimes they’re the extension of the local city-owned utility. Sometimes they’re built on the back of public/private partnerships.</p>
<p>According to a&nbsp;<a href="https://communitynets.org/content/community-network-map">database</a>&nbsp;of such networks tracked by the Institute For Local Self Reliance (which I have done research and writing work for), there are now 450 municipal broadband networks in the U.S. Since January 1, 2021, at least 47 new networks have come online, with dozens in the planning or pre-construction phases. And this may be an undercount given the FCC’s failure to track them all.</p>
<p>But because big monopolies (and a bunch of Libertarian think tankers with covert financial ties to those same monopolies) didn’t like the idea for ideological or financial reasons, federal and state policymakers have vacillated between demonizing the idea of municipal broadband, or banned it entirely (17 states <a href="https://broadbandnow.com/report/municipal-broadband-roadblocks#:~:text=17%20states%20currently%20have%20laws,operating%20municipal%20networks%20more%20difficult.">currently prohibit such networks</a>, and House Republicans attempted <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/02/19/new-bill-tries-to-ban-community-broadband-during-pandemic/">a federal ban during COVID</a>). </p>
<p>Again, this could have all been prevented if big ISPs like AT&amp;T, Comcast, Verizon, CenturyLink and others had actually delivered the affordable, ultra-fast access Americans have demanded for decades. It could have been avoided if they’d embraced competition. It could have been avoided if they’d <a href="https://mountainstatespotlight.org/2020/12/09/frontier-has-sucked-up-millions-before-without-giving-w-va-good-broadband-theyre-about-to-get-another-chance/">properly used</a> the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2020/06/22/att-has-now-eliminated-41000-jobs-since-42-billion-trump-tax-cut/">untold billions</a> in taxpayer subsidies they’ve received over the last thirty years to expand access. </p>
<p>Community and municipal broadband sees widespread bipartisan support. It’s an organic, highly local, response to decades of corruption and market failure these companies enabled at every step of the way. Any impact it has on regional telecom monopolies was entirely earned on the back of decades of hubris and greed.</p>

Credit: Livioandronico2013. CC BY-SA 4.0.</span></p><div><p>The <em>Pax Romana—</em>the 200-year “<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2v1yIKNR3jiV94tGi0g5ot">golden age</a>” of the Roman Empire—was a marvel of diversity, connectivity, and unchallenged hegemony. By the middle of the second century AD, imperial Rome ruled territory across three different continents. Roughly one-quarter of the Earth’s population, some 60 million people, lived under Rome’s vast aegis, and the emperors of the age—most notably Marcus Aurelius—enjoyed the consent of those they governed. The Empire’s elites—witnessing the disciplined legions, widespread religiosity, cultural efflorescence, and dominant economy—likely expected their world order to endure forever.</p>
<p>In the year 166 AD, however, seemingly eternal Rome was caught completely off-guard as a deadly novel disease swept across the Eurasian landmass. It ransacked Rome’s cities for at least a decade and preceded centuries of decline. This major biological event—now known as the Antonine plague—appears to have been <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pox-Romana-Turning-Ancient-History/dp/069121915X">the world’s first pandemic</a>.</p>
<p>Historians hotly debate its death toll—with estimates ranging from 2 percent to 35 percent mortality—and its broader social and economic effects. The disease itself remains undiagnosed. The great Greek physician Galen described its main symptoms as fever, throat ulcers, and a pustular rash. Some have suspected it was measles or smallpox, but <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-roman-archaeology/article/smallpoxs-antiquity-in-doubt/B15B505D959E90824B6B9DCFAB1FA124">modern analysis</a> provides reasons to doubt these as the possible culprits. Human remains from the Antonine plague period, meanwhile, have thus far failed to yield genetic evidence sufficient to identify the pathogen.</p>
<p>Although the plague did not on its own cut short Rome’s dominance, it struck an empire that was confronting multiple challenges beneath a veneer of prosperity and growth—factors that modern-day infectious disease experts might recognize as creating the ideal conditions for pandemics. Much remains unknown about the Antonine plague; in some ways, modern scholars are just as in the dark about this first pandemic as its contemporary victims. But interdisciplinary researchers, trying to understand how the plague could have helped push such a powerful empire to the breaking point, have recently been unravelling some of its mysteries.</p><div id="thebu-623384653"><p><a data-no-instant="1" href="https://thebulletin.org/magazine/2024-05/?utm_source=Website&amp;utm_medium=MobileMediumRectangle&amp;utm_campaign=Website_MayMagazine_05072024&amp;utm_content=ClimateChange_MayMagazine_05072024" rel="noopener" target="_blank" aria-label="2024 May Magazine – Mobile Medium Rectangle"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://thebulletin.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-May-Magazine-%E2%80%93-Mobile-Medium-Rectangle.png" alt="" srcset="https://thebulletin.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-May-Magazine-%E2%80%93-Mobile-Medium-Rectangle.png 1250w, https://thebulletin.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-May-Magazine-%E2%80%93-Mobile-Medium-Rectangle-300x250.png 300w, https://thebulletin.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-May-Magazine-%E2%80%93-Mobile-Medium-Rectangle-1024x854.png 1024w, https://thebulletin.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-May-Magazine-%E2%80%93-Mobile-Medium-Rectangle-768x640.png 768w, https://thebulletin.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-May-Magazine-%E2%80%93-Mobile-Medium-Rectangle-444x370.png 444w" sizes="(max-width: 1250px) 100vw, 1250px" width="300" height="250"></a></p></div>

Historians, archaeologists, and scientists have been sharing data and expertise, working together to develop histories of past pandemics—including the Antonine plague—that are surprisingly comprehensive and nuanced. Paleogenetic and paleoclimatological evidence reveal the crucial role of environmental and demographic factors in the pandemic. Insights from modern economics and sociology have improved historians’ understanding of how the institutions of the Roman Empire were affected by disease mortality. Even before the pandemic arrived, the pre-existing ecological, economic, and demographic context of mid-second century Eurasia prepared the way for the disease that would accelerate the end of Rome’s era of efflorescence.</p>
<p>Research assessing the severity of modern anthropogenic climate change, for example, has compiled a vast array of climatological data dating back to the Roman period, and well before. Such research offers historians an increasingly detailed and <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-81103-7_13">comprehensive view</a> of the ecosystems of ancient Eurasia and Africa. The ancient Mediterranean was (and still is) polka-dotted with microclimates; meanwhile, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1721818115">ice cores</a> from Greenland, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-021-00698-0">ancient tree rings</a> from northern Europe, and <a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/roman-empire-cold-climate-plague-archaeology">sediment cores</a> from Egypt and Italy suggest that some regions in and around Roman territory endured cooler temperatures and droughts about a decade ahead of the Antonine plague pandemic. These climatological shifts were hardly severe, nor did they affect the entire Mediterranean Basin. Many of the affected regions, however, happened to play outsized roles in supplying Roman cities with grain.</p>
<p>The annual Nile flood in Egypt, for instance, reliably nourished well-irrigated grainfields with nutrient-rich water from the Ethiopian highlands. The resulting harvests, often abundant, were stored and then shipped in massive vessels across the Mediterranean to Rome for distribution to the city’s masses. But from the 150s onward, a series of droughts near the Nile headwaters in equatorial east Africa disrupted the flood, reducing the productivity of Rome’s main breadbasket. Meanwhile, at the same time, increased storm activity in the western Mediterranean—as confirmed by sediment cores extracted from the coast of southern France—made shipping already scarce grain far riskier than in previous centuries. As a result, denizens of Rome and several other major cities, and possibly also some of Rome’s soldiers, endured greater food insecurity and malnutrition—weakening their bodies ahead of the pandemic’s arrival in the 160s.</p>
<p><strong>An interconnected, vulnerable ancient world.</strong> Historians still don’t know exactly where and when the pandemic entered Roman territory. But, again, historical circumstances conspired in favor of the novel disease.</p>
<p>An outbreak today can <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/parasitology/fulltext/S1471-4922(18)30142-9#%20">jump continents</a> as quickly as an airplane can fly. Travel and transportation can facilitate the spread of infectious diseases. It may not be coincidental, therefore, that by the time of the Antonine plague, the Eurasian landmass was better-connected than ever before. In 166 AD, for the first time in recorded history, the imperial Han court in Luoyang, China, received visitors from the Roman Empire. Merchants from India, sub-Saharan Africa, Arabia, and Egypt rode the trade winds to ports all around the Indian Ocean. Roman soldiers, seeking to police and tax such abundant trade, ventured well outside Roman borders—as Latin inscriptions in the Farasan Islands of southern Arabia attest. In short, there were plenty of opportunities for novel diseases to cross political and geographic barriers into new populations, transforming what might have otherwise been a regional epidemic into a pandemic that spread across three different continents.</p>
<p>In the Roman Empire, an impressive transportation infrastructure—once a source of economic and military power—became a sudden liability once the pandemic breached its borders. Roman roads and ships weren’t themselves responsible, but larger movements and migrations transported the disease from city to city.</p>
<p>Because of the shifts in local climates, and resulting food insecurity, desperate and hungry rural peasants had already flooded into cities in Asia Minor (present day Turkey) and Italy. Beyond Roman borders, nomadic peoples on the Eurasian Steppe in search of food pushed against the Germanic tribes along the Danube River, sending hordes of migrants and invaders into Roman frontier provinces. Contemporary sources from the Han Empire reference a series of epidemics in several Chinese cities, as well as the army. Concerns over ever-present sickness were partly responsible for the famed <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Yellow-Turbans#ref268958">Yellow Turban Rebellion</a>—a peasant rebellion that unleashed decades of civil war and instability in much of eastern China.</p>
<p>At the exact same time, tens of thousands of Roman soldiers were uprooted from their military bases and sent thousands of miles—first to fight a war on the Empire’s eastern frontier in Persia (Iran), then back into Europe to resist the surging tide of Germanic migrants. At multiple points along these journeys, soldiers could have collected the Antonine plague pathogen.</p>
<p><strong>The plague and the capital.</strong> Rome’s large legions might have sustained disease transmission for weeks, if not months, as armies passed back-and-forth through the same densely populated cities of Asia Minor and Italy that were taking on underfed refugees from the budding crisis.</p>
<p>None of these cities, however, were as packed as Rome—a cosmopolis of over one million people. In October of 166 AD, just as the pandemic reached Italy, the city held a massive triumphal parade for the legions, fresh off their victory in Persia. Perhaps 100,000 or more citizens crammed into the city center to celebrate, creating what may have been the world’s first super-spreader event.</p>
<p>Shortly following the triumph, the streets of Rome must have resembled a war zone. Bodies were so strewn about the city that Marcus Aurelius and his co-emperor imposed strict regulations on burials and tombs. They funded corpse removal. They sought out the gods for aid. At some point, perhaps after the first wave abated, the emperors commissioned statues to memorialize elite victims, while the masses were commemorated in remembrance events.</p>
<p>The ancient Romans had limited means to treat the Antonine plague, although they developed many remedies of unknown or suspect effectiveness. Elites, including the emperor Marcus Aurelius, used a concoction called “theriac”—an aged blend of exotic spices and expensive substances, mixed with a dose of opium. Others tried various smell therapies—including smelling laurel leaves. Galen claimed that fresh urine applied directly to the skin could help—the younger the urinator, the better.</p>
<p>The Antonine plague would continue to rage in the cities and military camps of the Roman Empire for at least another decade. A second wave of an undiagnosed epidemic disease hit Rome in 190 AD; if this too was part of the Antonine plague, then the pandemic lasted at least a quarter-century. However long it endured, the plague was an unprecedented test the resilience of Roman systems; Galen named it “the everlasting pestilence.”</p>
<p>Marcus may have rallied Rome during the first wave. But when the plague struck northern Italy a few years later, he abandoned his friends and soldiers to a dark winter of sickness. Officials responded to drought and high grain prices with price controls, most likely disincentivizing production and making shortages even worse. In response to plague and war deaths in the legions, Marcus recruited criminals and slaves into the military. This proved fateful when, a few years later, many of them deserted and, now well-equipped and trained, turned on the cities of the Empire, pillaging and murdering in a crime wave that stretched from Asia Minor to western Europe.</p>
<p>While it might seem like the pandemic single-handedly caused the decline and fall of the Roman Empire, it was clearly more complicated than that. The western Roman Empire would muddle along for over 200 years, but its heyday ended with the Antonine plague. The plague exposed and exacerbated pre-existing fragilities. Many Roman achievements may have been grand, but the Empire was a product of its pre-industrial context, in which weather, famine, and other factors could be destabilizing. The agricultural economy was subject to the vagaries of its ecosystem and the limitations of fledgling markets. Roman cities, for all the attention paid to aqueducts and baths, were contaminated by poor sanitation and grappled with persistent malnutrition. They may have been temporarily well-connected enough to enjoy the commodities of distant regions, but these same populations were simultaneously “immunologically naive” to pathogens from outside their immediate area. While it is no coincidence that the pandemic and the end of the <em>Pax Romana</em> occurred at the same time, exploring the connections between them underscores the interconnectedness and even interdependence of past human societies and their environmental contexts.</p>
<p>Present societies now easily mitigate much of what ailed Rome during the Antonine plague. The wonders of modern medicine—treatments, vaccines, and proven sanitation measures—render once-deadly scourges innocuous or even eradicated. A globalized society is one which collaborates and coordinates—orienting markets, scientific research, and communication channels towards responding to threats and, even better, predicting and preventing them before they occur. And yet, like the Roman Empire, the strengths of the modern world order have inbuilt weaknesses. Travel and transportation are so cheap and easy that pandemic diseases seem virtually impossible to contain.</p>
<p>The collaborative process that permeates most democratic societies nevertheless requires seemingly slow and cumbersome debate and consensus building. Yet all told, the modern world’s capacity to understand and adapt to our natural context—clumsy as it is at times—so far continues to outpace the rapidly evolving diseases that surround us. A vital part of our strategy must be to <a href="https://thebulletin.org/2023/01/deadliest-pandemics/">learn from</a> the pandemics of the past.</p>

        </div><p>Cecil replies:</p><p>Very funny, J.W., and actually not all that far off the mark. Turning to <i>Taber’s Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary,</i> which for an old deve like me is a constant garden of delight, we learn the following:</p><ul><li>An “-ectomy” is the cutting out of something, as in “tonsillectomy.” In other words, hacking it off. This may account for lingering male squeamishness about another well-known operation, the vasectomy. (In reality, of course, only a tiny portion of the vas deferens is removed.)</li><li>An “-ostomy” (actually, “-stomy”) involves cutting a hole in something, or more precisely, furnishing it with a mouth or outlet, as in “colostomy,” in which an opening is cut into the colon to create an artificial anus. (Seems like a waste, considering how many real ones there are already.)</li><li>Finally, there’s “-otomy,” (or “-tomy”), which means to slice it up, i.e., an operation in which cutting is involved. Thus we can distinguish a lobectomy, in which a lobe, typically of the brain, is removed, from a lobotomy, in which they merely jab an ice pick in there and chop things up.</li></ul><p>I’m not kidding, either. You might want to read an engrossing volume entitled <i>Great and Desperate Cures: The Rise and Decline of Psychosurgery and Other Radical Treatments for Mental Illness,</i> by Elliott Valenstein (1986). Valenstein quotes a letter written in the mid-1940s by one prominent lobotomist, Walter Freeman:</p><div data-align-center="">
            <blockquote><p>I have also been trying out a sort of half-way stage between electroshock and prefrontal lobotomy [to treat mental patients]. … This consists of knocking them out with a shock and while they are under the ‘anesthetic’ thrusting an ice pick up between the eyeball and the eyelid through the roof of the orbit [the bony cavity that contains the eye] actually into the frontal lobe of the brain and making the lateral cut by swinging the thing from side to side. I have done two patients on both sides and another on one side without running into any complications, except a very black eye in one case. There may be trouble later on but it seemed fairly easy, although definitely a disagreeable thing to watch. It remains to be seen how these cases hold up, but so far they have shown considerable relief of their symptoms, and only some of the minor behavior difficulties that follow lobotomy. [That is, prefrontal lobotomy, which typically involved boring holes through the front of the skull. The ice pick operation is called a transorbital lobotomy.] They can even get up and go home within an hour or so. If this works out it will be a great advance for people who are too bad for shock but not bad enough for surgery.</p></blockquote>

            
        </div>
<p>Freeman went around the country in the late 1940s demonstrating this technique in mental hospitals. These exhibitions reportedly went well for the most part, except on those occasions when the patient bled too much or the ice pick broke off within the orbit or inside the skull. To remedy this problem, the ice pick was later replaced with a sturdier instrument and an ordinary carpenter’s hammer was used to drive it into the brain.</p><p>The first lobotomy in the United States took place on September 14, 1936. By August 15, 1949, the procedure had been performed 10,706 times. In the mid-1950s the popularity of the operation waned due to the availability of psychotropic drugs, which offered similar benefits without the trauma. One hopes today the practice is extinct, but you never know.</p><p>My point in telling this story is that you’re right to regard -otomies, -ectomies and so on with some skepticism. The majority of medical professionals performing such techniques help their patients, but a few are just mopes with icepicks. The challenge is telling the two apart.</p><p>Cecil Adams</p><p>Send questions to Cecil via <a href="mailto:cecil@straightdope.com" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">cecil@straightdope.com.</a><br></p></div>

<div>
    <p data-block-key="yqqoj">At I/O 2023, we launched <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-project-gameface/">Project Gameface</a>, an open-source, hands-free gaming ‘mouse’ enabling people to control a computer’s cursor using their head movement and facial gestures. People can raise their eyebrows to click and drag, or open their mouth to move the cursor, making gaming more accessible.</p><p data-block-key="c8bt5">The project was inspired by the story of quadriplegic video game streamer Lance Carr, who lives with muscular dystrophy, a progressive disease that weakens muscles. And we collaborated with Lance to bring Project Gameface to life. The full story behind the product is available on the <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-project-gameface/">Google Keyword blog</a>.</p><p data-block-key="7k1tq">We’ve been delighted to see companies like <a href="https://www.playability.gg/">playAbility</a> utilize Project Gameface building blocks, like <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/mediapipe-assets/Model%20Card%20Blendshape%20V2.pdf">MediaPipe Blendshapes</a>, in their inclusive software. Now, we’re open sourcing more code for Project Gameface to help developers build Android applications to make every Android device more accessible. Through the device's camera, it seamlessly tracks facial expressions and head movements, translating them into intuitive and personalized control. Developers can now build applications where their users can configure their experience by customizing facial expressions, gesture sizes, cursor speed, and more.</p><p data-block-key="ca2du">For this release, we collaborated with <a href="https://incluzza.org/">Incluzza</a>, a social enterprise in India that supports people with disability, to learn how Project Gameface can be expanded to educational, work and other settings, like being able to type messages to family or searching for new jobs.</p>
</div>    <div>
    <p data-block-key="yqqoj">While building Project Gameface for Android, we based our product design and development on three core principles:</p><ol><li data-block-key="9t5u7">Give people with disabilities a new additional means to operate Android devices.</li></ol><p data-block-key="drc1o">2. Build a cost-effective solution that’s generally available to enable scalable usage.</p><p data-block-key="64b54">3. Leverage the learnings and guiding principles from the first Gameface launch to make the product user-friendly and customizable.</p><h3 data-block-key="8dm8n"><b><br>Building out a cursor in an Android device</b></h3><p data-block-key="d9s6v">We are launching a novel way to start operating an Android device. Based on the positive feedback on Project Gameface, we realized that developers and users appreciated the idea of moving a cursor with head movement and taking actions through facial expressions.</p><p data-block-key="13v61">We have replicated the same idea to bring a new virtual cursor on an Android device. We are using the Android accessibility service to create a new cursor and are leveraging <a href="https://youtu.be/3NePkYhFkiw?si=dIk4396bp-kVXLQW">MediaPipe’s Face Landmarks Detection API</a> to program the cursor in a way so it moves according to a user’s head movement.</p><p data-block-key="1t503">Within the API, there are 52 face blendshape values which represent the expressiveness of 52 facial gestures such as raising left eyebrow or mouth opening. We use some of these 52 values to effectively map and control a wide range of functions, offering users expanded possibilities for customization and manipulation. We are also leveraging blendshapes coefficients which gives developers an ability to set different thresholds on each specific expression and this helps them customize the experience.</p>

    <h3 data-block-key="yqqoj"><b>Bringing the best of Android Accessibility Service to Project Gameface</b></h3><h4 data-block-key="4dvo5"><i>Mobile actions</i></h4><p data-block-key="a18bh">In the Windows version for Project Gameface, we enabled users to replicate common click actions. However, in Android, there is a wider array of capabilities that users need to perform. There are touch events that are inputted into the OS and there are other global action events like “Go Back”, “Switch to Multitasking”, “Home”. We used the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/accessibilityservice/AccessibilityService">Android Accessibility API supported mobile actions</a> to determine which actions could be provided to the user. Currently, Project Gameface for Android supports GLOBAL_ACTION_HOME, GLOBAL_ACTION_BACK, GLOBAL_ACTION_NOTIFICATIONS, GLOBAL_ACTION_ACCESSIBILITY_ALL_APPS</p><h4 data-block-key="cl7e2"><i><br>Camera Feed</i></h4><p data-block-key="9ug6s">The camera feed significantly enhances the user experience, facilitating accurate threshold settings and a deeper comprehension of gestures. It also sends a clear signal to the user that their camera is being actively used to understand their head movements and gestures.</p><p data-block-key="a6p3">Just creating an overlay of camera feed would have prevented developers from accessing some important sections of their Android device like the Android settings. We use Android accessibility service with Project Gameface to enable the camera to continue floating even in Android settings and any other important sections of a user’s Android device.</p>

</div>
  <div>
    <h3 data-block-key="yqqoj"><b>Enabling users to perform the ‘drag function’</b></h3><p data-block-key="2tps8">The Android accessibility service currently lacks a straightforward method for users to perform real-time interactive screen dragging. However, our product has been upgraded to include drag functionality, allowing users to define both starting and ending points. Consequently, the drag action will be executed seamlessly along the specified path.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/paligemma?ref=blog.roboflow.com"><u>PaliGemma</u></a> is a vision language model (VLM) developed and released by Google that has <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/multimodal-models/"><u>multimodal</u></a> capabilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike other VLMs, such as <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/gpt-4o-vision-use-cases/"><u>OpenAI’s GPT-4o</u></a>, <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/gemini-what-we-know/"><u>Google Gemini</u></a>, and <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/claude-3-opus-multimodal/"><u>Anthropic’s Claude 3</u></a> which have struggled with object detection and segmentation, PaliGemma has a wide range of abilities, paired with the ability to fine-tune for better performance on specific tasks. </p><p>Google’s decision to open source a highly capable multimodal model with the ability to fine-tune on custom data is a major breakthrough for open-source AI. PaliGemma gives you the opportunity to create custom multimodal models which you can self-host in the cloud and potentially on larger edge devices like NVIDIA Jetsons.</p><h2 id="what-is-paligemma">What is PaliGemma?</h2><p>PaliGemma, <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemma-family-and-toolkit-expansion-io-2024/?ref=blog.roboflow.com"><u>released alongside other products</u></a> at the <a href="https://io.google/2024/?ref=blog.roboflow.com"><u>2024 Google I/O event</u></a>, is a combined multimodal model based on two other models from Google research: SigLIP, a vision model, and Gemma, a large language model, which means the model is a composition of a Transformer decoder and a Vision Transformer image encoder. It takes both image and text as input and generates text as output, supporting multiple languages. </p><p>Important aspects of PaliGemma:</p><ul><li>Relatively small 3 billion combined parameter model</li><li><a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemma/terms?ref=blog.roboflow.com"><u>Permissible commercial use terms</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/paligemma/fine-tuning-paligemma?ref=blog.roboflow.com"><u>Ability to fine-tune</u></a> for image and short video caption, visual question answering, text reading, object detection, and object segmentation</li></ul><p>While PaliGemma is useful without fine-tuning, Google says it is “not designed to be used directly, but to be transferred (by fine-tuning) to specific tasks using a similar prompt structure” which means whatever baseline we can observe with the model weights is only the tip of the iceberg for how useful the model may be in a given context. <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/paligemma/model-card?ref=blog.roboflow.com#pre-train_datasets"><u>PaliGemma is pre-trained</u></a> on WebLI, CC3M-35L, VQ²A-CC3M-35L/VQG-CC3M-35L, OpenImages, and WIT.</p><h3 id="links-to-paligemma-resources">Links to PaliGemma Resources</h3><p>Google supplied ample resources to start prototyping with PaliGemma and we’ve curated the highest quality information for those of you who want to jump into using PaliGemma immediately. We suggest getting started with the following resources:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/google-research/big_vision/blob/main/big_vision/configs/proj/paligemma/README.md?ref=blog.roboflow.com"><u>PaliGemma Github README</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/paligemma?ref=blog.roboflow.com"><u>PaliGemma documentation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/paligemma/fine-tuning-paligemma?ref=blog.roboflow.com"><u>PaliGemma fine-tuning documentation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-research/big_vision/blob/main/big_vision/configs/proj/paligemma/finetune_paligemma.ipynb?ref=blog.roboflow.com"><u>Fine-tune PaliGemma in Google Colab</u></a></li><li><a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/publishers/google/model-garden/363?project=roboflow-marketing&amp;ref=blog.roboflow.com"><u>Access PaliGemma in Google Vertex</u></a></li></ul><p>In this post we will explore what PaliGemma can do, compare PaliGemma benchmarks to other LMMs, understand PaliGemma’s limitations, and see how it performs in real world use cases. We’ve put together learnings that can save you time while testing PaliGemma.</p><p>Let’s get started!</p><h2 id="what-can-paligemma-do">What can PaliGemma do?</h2><p>PaliGemma is a single-turn vision language model and it works best when fine-tuning to a specific use case. This means you can input an image and text string, such as a prompt to caption the image, or a question and PaliGemma will output text in response to the input, such as a caption of the image, an answer to a question, or a list of object bounding box coordinates.</p><p>Tasks PaliGemma is suited to perform relate to the <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/paligemma/model-card?ref=blog.roboflow.com#benchmark-results"><u>benchmarking results Google</u></a> released across the following tasks:</p><ul><li>Fine-tuning on single tasks</li><li>Image question answering and captioning</li><li>Video question answering and captioning</li><li>Segmentation</li></ul><p>This means PaliGemma is useful for straightforward and specific questions related to visual data.</p><p>We’ve created a table to show PaliGemma results relative to other models based on reported results on common benchmarks.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2024/05/image-6.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="896" height="146" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/image-6.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2024/05/image-6.png 896w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>While benchmarks are helpful data points, they do not tell the entire story. PaliGemma is <strong>built to be fine-tuned</strong> and the other models are closed-source. For the purposes of showing which options are available, we compare against other, often much larger, models that are unable to be fine-tuned.</p><p>It is worth experimenting to see if fine-tuning with custom data will lead to better performance for your specific use case than out-of-the-box performance with other models.</p><p>Later in this post, we will compare PaliGemma to other <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/gpt-4-vision-alternatives/"><u>open-source VLMs and LMMs</u></a> using a standard set of tests. Continue reading to see how it performs.</p><h2 id="how-to-fine-tune-paligemma">How to Fine-tune PaliGemma</h2><p>One of the exciting aspects of PaliGemma is its ability to finetune on custom use-case data. <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/paligemma/fine-tuning-paligemma?ref=blog.roboflow.com"><u>A notebook</u></a> published by Google’s PaliGemma team showcases how to fine-tune on a small dataset.</p><p>It’s important to note that in this example, only the attention layers are fine-tuned and therefore the performance improvements may be limited.</p><h2 id="how-to-deploy-and-use-paligemma">How to Deploy and Use PaliGemma</h2><p>You can deploy PaliGemma using an open-source <a href="https://inference.roboflow.com/?ref=blog.roboflow.com"><u>Inference package</u></a>. First, we will need to install Inference, as well as some other packages needed to run PaliGemma.</p><div><p>📓</p><div><p>See the PaliGemma inference notebook, which contains the code below </p><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_q09OjR2Ldl1FZnvfqwckvxrW_FIYclC?usp=sharing&amp;ref=blog.roboflow.com"><u>here</u></a><p>.</p></div></div><pre><code>!git clone https://github.com/roboflow/inference.git
%cd inference
!pip install -e .</code></pre><pre><code>!pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git accelerate -q</code></pre><p>Next, we will set up PaliGemma by importing the module from Inference and putting in our <a href="https://docs.roboflow.com/api-reference/authentication?ref=blog.roboflow.com"><u>Roboflow API key</u></a>.</p><pre><code>import inference
from inference.models.paligemma.paligemma import PaliGemma

pg = PaliGemma(api_key="YOUR ROBOFLOW API KEY")</code></pre><p>Last, we can input a test image as a Pillow image, pair it with a prompt, and wait for the result.</p><pre><code>from PIL import Image

Here, PaliGemma gives a close but incorrect result consistently across several attempts.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2024/05/image-12.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="691" height="486" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/image-12.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2024/05/image-12.png 691w"></figure><p>However, on an image with a pizza menu, when asked to provide the cost of a specific pizza, it returned a correct value. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2024/05/image-13.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="690" height="510" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/image-13.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2024/05/image-13.png 690w"></figure><p>This performs similar or equivalent to the experience we had with GPT-4 with Vision, where it failed tax extraction but answered the pizza menu question correctly. Gemini, Claude 3 and the new GPT-4o did answer both questions correctly, as well as <a href="https://roboflow.com/compare/qwenvl-vs-gpt-4-vision?ref=blog.roboflow.com"><u>Qwen-VL-Plus</u></a>, an open-source VLM.</p><h3 id="visual-question-answering-vqa">Visual Question Answering (VQA)</h3><p>Visual Question Answering involves posing a model with an image and a question requiring some form of recognition, identification, or reasoning.</p><p>When posed with a question on how much money was present in a picture with 4 coins, it answered with 4 coins. A technically correct answer, but the question asked for the amount of money in the image.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2024/05/image-14.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="686" height="485" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/image-14.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2024/05/image-14.png 686w"></figure><p>When tasked with identifying a scene featuring Kevin Mcallister from the movie Home Alone, it responded with “christmas”.

However, PaliGemma is reported to have object detection and instance segmentation abilities.</p><p>First, we test with the same prompt we have given other models in the past. Here, it returns an incorrect, likely hallucinated result.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2024/05/image-16.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="691" height="479" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/image-16.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2024/05/image-16.png 691w"></figure><p>However, when prompting with the keyword `detect`, followed by the object `dog` (so `detect dog`) as detailed in the model documentation, it correctly and accurately identifies the dog in the image. Using the keyword `segment dog` also resulted in a correct segmentation.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2024/05/image-17.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="632" height="419" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/image-17.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2024/05/image-17.png 632w"></figure><p>Although it is very impressive that a VLM is able to provide object detection and recognition capabilities, it is worth noting that only basic examples, such as those possible with a traditional object detection model, succeeded. When prompted to find cars, (there is a car present visible through the door of the building in the back) it returned no results.</p><h2 id="use-cases-for-paligemma">Use Cases for PaliGemma</h2><p>Whether using PaliGemma zero-shot or fine-tuned on custom data, there are specific use cases tailored to PaliGemma’s strengths that will open the door to new AI use cases. Let’s take a look at a two of them.</p><h3 id="custom-applications">Custom Applications</h3><p>Models like Claude 3, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and GPT-4o are used out-of-the-box and applied to problems they are suited to solve. PaliGemmi brings multimodal abilities to use cases that are still unsolved by closed-source models because you can fine-tune PaliGemma with proprietary data related to your problem. This is useful in industries like manufacturing, CPG, healthcare, and security. If you have a unique problem that closed-models have not seen, and will never see due to their proprietary nature, then PaliGemma is a great entry point into building custom AI solutions.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="ocr">OCR</h3><p>As shown earlier in this article, PaliGemma is a strong OCR model without any additional fine-tuning. When building OCR applications to scale to billions of predictions, latency, cost, and accuracy can be difficult to balance. Before PaliGemma, closed-source models were the best-in-class option for performance but their cost and lack of model ownership made them difficult to justify in production. This model can provide immediate performance and be improved over time by fine-tuning on your specific data.</p><h2 id="limitations-of-paligemma">Limitations of PaliGemma</h2><p>PaliGemma, and all VLMs, are best suited for tasks with clear instructions and are not the best tool for open-ended, complex, nuanced, or reason based problems. This is where VLMs are distinct from LMMs and you will find the best results if you use the models where they are most likely to perform well.</p><p>In terms of context, PaliGemma has information based on the pre-training datasets and any data supplied during fine-tuning. PaliGemma will not know information outside of this and, barring any weights updates with new data from Google or the open source community, you should not rely on PaliGemma as a knowledge base.</p><p>To get the most out of PaliGemma, and have a reason to use the model over other open source models, you’ll want to train the model on custom data. Its zero-shot performance is not state-of-the-art across most benchmarks. Setting up a custom training pipeline will be necessary to warrant using PaliGemma for most use cases.</p><p>Finally, during various tests, we saw drastic differences in results with slight changes to prompts. This is similar behavior to other LMMs, like <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/yolo-world-prompting-tips/"><u>YOLO-World</u></a>, and takes time to understand how to best prompt the model. Changes in a prompt, like removing an ‘s’ to make a word singular rather than plural, can be the difference between a perfect detection and an unusable output.</p><figure><div><p><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-14-at-8.44.07-PM.png" width="1610" height="1054" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-14-at-8.44.07-PM.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-14-at-8.44.07-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-14-at-8.44.07-PM.png 1600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-14-at-8.44.07-PM.png 1610w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-14-at-8.43.35-PM.png" width="1688" height="946" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-14-at-8.43.35-PM.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-14-at-8.43.35-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-14-at-8.43.35-PM.png 1600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-14-at-8.43.35-PM.png 1688w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-14-at-8.45.12-PM.png" width="1804" height="1138" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-14-at-8.45.12-PM.png 600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-14-at-8.45.12-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/size/w1600/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-14-at-8.45.12-PM.png 1600w, https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-14-at-8.45.12-PM.png 1804w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div><figcaption><p><span>Notice the different results based on plural vs singular nouns</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Google’s release of PaliGemma is incredibly useful for the advancement of multimodal AI. The lightweight open source model built for fine-tuning means anyone can custom train their own large vision-language model and deploy it for any commercial purpose on their own hardware or cloud. </p><p>Previous LMMs have been extremely expensive to fine-tune and often require large amounts of compute to run, making them prohibitive for broad adoption. PaliGemma breaks the mold and offers people building custom AI applications a breakthrough model to create sophisticated applications.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">This project has been decomissioned. I, James Sumners, took it on when it was
languishing without any maintenance as it filled a need in the ecosystem and
I had built things at a prior organization that depended upon this project.
I spent a lot of time triaging issues and reworking things toward a path
that could be more easily maintained by a community of volunteers. But I have
not had the time to dedicate to this project in quite a while. There are
outstanding issues that would take me at least a week of dedicated development
time to solve, and I cannot afford to take time off of work to do that.
Particularly considering that the aforementioned organization was two
jobs ago, and it is extremely unlikely that I will transition to a role again
that will need this project.</p>
<p dir="auto">So, why am I just now deciding to decomission this project? Because today,
2024-05-14, I received the following email:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ldapjs/node-ldapjs/blob/master/dt.png"><img src="https://github.com/ldapjs/node-ldapjs/raw/master/dt.png" alt="Abusive email"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I will not tolerate abuse, and I especially will not tolerate tacit death
threats, over a hobby. You can thank the author of that email for the
decomissioning on this project.</p>
<p dir="auto">My recommendation to you in regard to LDAP operations: write a gateway in a
language that is more suited to these types of operations. I'd suggest
<a href="https://go.dev/" rel="nofollow">Go</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">👋</p>
<p dir="auto">P.S.: if I ever do need this project again, I might revive it. But I'd fight
hard for my suggestion above. Also, I will consider turning it over to an
interested party, but I will require at least one recommendation from a
Node.js core contributor that I can vet with the people that I know on that
team.</p>

Automatic protection the moment your phone is stolen</h2><p data-block-key="an4h1">Having a device stolen is unexpected and stressful and it can be hard to react quickly at the moment it happens. That’s why we created features that can automatically recognize suspicious signals and proactively protect your data on the device.</p><p data-block-key="3jaj2"><b>Automatic AI-powered screen lock for when your phone is snatched.</b> Theft Detection Lock is a powerful new feature that uses Google AI to sense if someone snatches your phone from your hand and tries to run, bike or drive away. If a common motion associated with theft is detected, your phone screen quickly locks – which helps keep thieves from easily accessing your data.</p><p data-block-key="7qjv1"><b>Added protection when a thief has your device.</b> If a thief tries to disconnect your phone for prolonged periods of time, Offline Device Lock automatically locks your screen to help protect your data even when your device is off the grid. Android can also recognize other signs that your device may be in the wrong hands. For example, it will lock your device screen when excessive failed authentication attempts are made.</p><p data-block-key="2p9na">Theft Detection Lock and Offline Device Lock will be available to Android 10+ devices through a Google Play services update later this year.</p></div>
