<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You probably don't think much about data brokers, but these behind-the-scenes companies collect, trade, and profit from our personal information every day. Data brokers like Acxiom, Experian, and Equifax gather data about us from public records, online activities, store loyalty programs, and more. This data gets packaged into profiles and sold to other businesses for targeted advertising, credit checks, background screening, and who knows what else.</p><p>All this happens without our knowledge or consent. Most people have no idea the extent of their digital footprint or how to even access the data collected about them. While we willingly give away some personal information to use online services, plenty is taken without our permission.<br></p><p>This lack of transparency and control is cause for concern. We have a right to know what personal data exists about us and where it is going. The good news is that there are steps you can take to uncover and delete your data from broker sites:</p><h3>Request Your Data &amp; Send Removal Requests</h3><p>Many data brokers allow you to access your personal information in their systems. Some even offer opt-out tools to stop data collection. Search for "data broker opt-out" to find relevant sites and submit access/deletion requests.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Be sure to keep records of all your requests, including copies of any emails or letters sent. Maintaining this documentation can be useful if you need to follow up or dispute an unfulfilled request.<br></p><p>For brokers without online tools, you'll need to directly request data removal via email or letter. Clearly state your name, address, relevant account numbers, and that you want your data deleted. Keep records of all requests.</p><p>Here is a list of the most prevalent data brokers:</p><ul role="list"><li>Acxiom</li><li>Experian</li><li>Equifax</li><li>TransUnion&nbsp;</li><li>PeopleSmart</li><li>BeenVerified</li><li>WhitePages</li><li>InstantCheckmate</li><li>Pipl</li><li>Intelius</li></ul><h3>Leverage Consumer Protection Laws</h3><p>Depending on your location, laws like the <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a> and <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> give consumers the right to request that companies delete their data.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) are two pivotal privacy laws that give consumers greater control over their personal data.<br></p><p>The CCPA went into effect in 2020 and grants new rights to California residents, like:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>The right to know what personal information companies collect about them and how it is used.</li><li>The right to opt-out of the sale of their data.</li><li>The right to request that their personal information be deleted.</li></ul><p>The GDPR took effect in 2018 and imposes strict guidelines around collecting and handling EU citizens' personal data, such as:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Requiring affirmative consent before collecting an individual's data.</li><li>Obligating companies to honor requests for data erasure within one month.</li><li>Establishing protections for data breach notification and cross-border data transfers.</li></ul><p>Leveraging these landmark laws can strengthen your ability to take control of your data from brokers. Understand your rights and don't hesitate to cite CCPA or GDPR to compel compliance.<br></p><h3>Use a Deletion Service</h3><p>Sites like <a href="https://joindeleteme.com/">DeleteMe</a>, <a href="https://get.incogni.io/aff_c?offer_id=1017&amp;aff_id=6796">Incogni</a> and <a href="https://abine.com/">Abine</a> will submit opt-out requests on your behalf and monitor to ensure your data stays removed. This simplifies the process, for a fee.<br></p><p>Regaining control of your personal information takes persistence and vigilance, but is worth it. Data brokers will continue collecting our data until laws and consumer pressure demand change. But we can fight back by actively managing our digital footprints and being conscious about what we are consenting to online.</p><p>‚Äç</p><p>*&nbsp;Links may contain affiliate links. </p></div></div>]]></description>

  <p>What better way to start off the new year than with a little rant.</p>

<p>I am not car aficionado, in fact, I am probably less interested in cars than the average person. As the tech bros have slowly crept into the automotive industry, I can‚Äôt help but feel like I‚Äôm witnessing a <em>car crash</em> in slow motion.</p>

<h3 id="cars-are-the-smart-tvs-of-today">Cars are the Smart TVs of today</h3>

<p>Have you tried shopping for a TV in the past 5 years? Actually, scratch that ‚Äì have you <em>used</em> a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù TV in the past 5 years? ‚Äì it‚Äôs awful. Sure, displays are getting better, but manufacturers insist on cramming bloatware and spyware, embellished in the worst UI imaginable, running on a processor designed for a smartwatch.</p>

<p><img src="https://petargyurov.com/assets/images/cars-suck-man/smart-tv-pooramid.png" width="200"> <em>The Essential Smart TV Pooramid</em></p>

<p>Picture quality is at phenomenal levels, even on low-cost offerings, but those inky blanks come at the cost of compromised privacy and ad-infested UI.</p>

<p>So what do cars have to do with any of this? Every product that takes a concrete position in human dynamics, be it a TV, a fridge or a car, follows a relatively predictable evolution: it starts of limited but promising, gets meaningful upgrades, and eventually slides into into the valley of ‚Äúenshittification‚Äù. Few are those who climb their way out of the shit-pit, fewer still are those who avoid it entirely.</p>

<p><img src="https://petargyurov.com/assets/images/cars-suck-man/valley-of-enshittification.png"> <em>100% science based chart</em></p>

<h3 id="whats-so-wrong-with-cars-then">What‚Äôs so wrong with cars then?</h3>

<p>We live in an era of peak automotive power, utility and luxury. Much like with TVs, we probably reached the first plateau of quality: image clarity, super thin displays, etc. Then we started getting things nobody asked for: frame rate interpolation (why God, why!?), insane image presets, automatic audio adjustments. I won‚Äôt talk about 3D TVs. Let‚Äôs just pretend that never happened and that drawer in your cabinet isn‚Äôt full of dusty 3D glasses that haven‚Äôt seen the light of day for the last decade.</p>

<p>Cars are entering the ‚Äúframe-interpolation‚Äù era, the slippery slope into the loathed, anti-consumer, anti-logic Shit Pit.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs just fire through this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hiding critical/often-used buttons behind touchscreens for the sake of minimalism (and cost?)</li>
  <li>On that note, poor physical layout in general (genuinely thinking that you can rate cars‚Äô on a ‚Äúhazard-light-button-placement index‚Äù)</li>
  <li>YOUR LED LIGHTS ARE TOO BRIGHT GODDAMIT</li>
  <li>Cars are getting too big; why are manufacturers pushing ‚Äúcrossovers‚Äù and SUVs on consumers and why are consumers buying them? I could write pages on this point alone.</li>
  <li>Combine the two previous points for peak blindness</li>
  <li>‚ÄúLow profile‚Äù rims/tyres/wheels/whatever: cost a fortune and more prone to getting scratched</li>
  <li>Subscription style plans trying to creep their way in</li>
  <li>ALL the privacy violations you could think of</li>
  <li>Rubbish software and UI all round: it‚Äôs 2024 and I dread it every time I need to pair my phone to a car</li>
  <li>That weird glossy pastel paintwork that‚Äôs so popular all of a sudden (I‚Äôm allowed one subjective point on here, OK?)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-car-of-the-future">The car of the future</h3>

<p>I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve reached the depths of the brown ocean‚Ä¶ yet. Who‚Äôs to blame here? Consumers? Manufacturers?</p>

<p>I know I sound like a luddite here but the same way I just want a good display from my TV, I want less from my car, not more.</p>

<p>I miss my 2005 Toyota Corolla üò¢</p>

<h2>What Is The Difference Between A Dockerfile, An Image And A Container?</h2>
<div>
	<p>All these things build on top of each other. You need a Dockerfile to create an image, and you need an Image to create a Container.</p>
</div>




<div>
		<ul>
<li><strong>Dockerfile:</strong>&nbsp;The first step in using Docker is writing a Dockerfile. It is an essential blueprint for constructing Docker images. It is a text file, is usually named ‚ÄúDockerfile‚Äù without any extension, and contains a series of instructions. Each line in this file represents a new instruction, forming a stack of layers. Each layer is cache-able. When you build an image twice, it will use the cache. When you change a line in the file, it rebuilds all instructions after and including the change.</li>
<li><strong>Image:</strong>&nbsp;Building a Dockerfile outputs a Docker image. You can think of an image like an executable. Just like clicking an icon (executable) on your desktop to launch an application. You can start an image to launch a container. The Docker image encapsulates your application code and all its dependencies. This includes the runtime and system libraries. It is a self-contained unit that ensures consistency and portability across various environments. For example, your development machine and your production server.</li>
<li><strong>Container:</strong>&nbsp;This is a dynamic, running instance of a Docker image. An executed image spawns a container with the command in the Dockerfile. Important to note: one image can give life to many containers. If Linux is your operating system, the Docker container will run as a process on the host machine. If you have a Windows or macOS machine, docker will run in a virtual machine (VM). The container will use the same kernel, either the kernel of Linux or the VM on Windows or macOS. The container itself is not a virtual machine. The container cannot see other processes of the host and has its own file system. This is why it seems as it is a virtual machine. But in reality, it shares the kernel of the host machine (or the kernel of the VM).</li>
</ul>
	</div>




<div>
	<p>In conclusion: the Dockerfile is the base for an image, and an image is used to create a container. A container is running as a process on the host machine. Yet, it has its own file system and is separated from the other processes.</p>
</div>



<h2 id="how-do-you-create-a-dockerfile">How Do You Create A Dockerfile?</h2>
<div>
	<p>To generate a Dockerfile, you can create a plain text file. This article will use the command line for it:</p>
</div>




<div>
		<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-1" data-shcb-language-name="Dockerfile" data-shcb-language-slug="dockerfile"><code><span># create a new file in your current working directory called Dockerfile</span>
$ touch Dockerfile
<span># open the file in your favorite editor (we are using Visual Studio Code)</span>
<span># if you do not have the code command installed, you will need to open it manually</span>
$ code Dockerfile</code><small id="shcb-language-1"><span>Code language:</span> <span>Bash</span> <span>(</span><span>bash</span><span>)</span></small></pre>
	</div>




<div>
	<p>A Dockerfile holds all the instructions to build, start and run your application. Every command that you otherwise need to execute manually is written in a single file. It starts by using a base image. This is usually a small Linux distribution like alpine. If you have to execute a binary, you should use&nbsp;<code>FROM <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scratch</a></code>. This article uses a&nbsp;<a href="https://fastify.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fastify</a>&nbsp;server, so it uses an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.alpinelinux.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alpine</a>&nbsp;image configured for&nbsp;<a href="https://nodejs.org/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Node.js</a>. You can view the complete code on&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/aichbauer/the-ultimate-docker-cheat-sheet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub</a>.</p>
</div>




<div>
	<p>Now we will edit the Dockerfile in Visual Studio Code:</p>
</div>




<div>
		<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-2" data-shcb-language-name="Dockerfile" data-shcb-language-slug="dockerfile"><code><span><span># the next line sets the base image for this image</span>

</span><span><span># node provides official images for Node.js and</span>

</span><span><span># all commands after this instruction will be</span>
</span><span><span># executed inside this directory</span>

<span><span># copies the package.json and package-lock.json</span>

</span>
</code><small id="shcb-language-2"><span>Code language:</span> <span>Dockerfile</span> <span>(</span><span>dockerfile</span><span>)</span></small></pre>
	</div>



<h3 id="what-is-a-multistage-dockerfile">What Is A Multistage Dockerfile?</h3>
<div>
	<p>You can compose a Dockerfile with many stages. You can think of one stage, as one image. Furthermore, you can then use materials like files from one stage in another stage. A new stage always starts with the line&nbsp;<code>FROM &lt;base-image&gt;</code>. You name a stage using the&nbsp;<code>as</code>&nbsp;keyword. This article uses a simple HTML and JavaScript file as our client application. As a web server, we will use&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nginx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NGINX</a>. You can view the complete code on&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/aichbauer/the-ultimate-docker-cheat-sheet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-type="link" data-id="https://github.com/aichbauer/the-ultimate-docker-cheat-sheet">GitHub</a>.</p>
</div>




<div>
	<p>A typical approach is to have a&nbsp;<code>builder stage</code>, with a larger base image. This image holds all executables and libraries needed to build your source code.</p>
</div>




<div>
	<p>The second stage is the&nbsp;<code>serve stage</code>&nbsp;and has a small base image. The benefit is fewer dependencies and libraries. Just enough to execute and serve your application.</p>
</div>




<div>
	<p>With this approach, you make your final image both smaller and more secure. As the image size decreases and the image consists of fewer libraries. Fewer system libraries means it has a lower attack surface. Multistage Dockerfiles are not limited to this use case and can have more than two stages as well.</p>
</div>




<div>
		<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-3" data-shcb-language-name="Bash" data-shcb-language-slug="bash"><code><span># lets create a new Dockerfile for our frontend application</span>
<span># as we can specify a file in the build command, we name this Dockerfile.client</span>
$ touch Dockerfile.client
<span># open the file in your favorite editor (we are using Visual Studio Code)</span>
<span># if you do not have the code command installed, you will need to open it</span>
$ code Dockerfile.client</code><small id="shcb-language-3"><span>Code language:</span> <span>Bash</span> <span>(</span><span>bash</span><span>)</span></small></pre>

<div>
	<p>Here is an example of a multistage app:</p>
</div>

</div>



<h3 id="how-do-you-name-your-images">How Do You Name Your Images?</h3>
<div>
	<p>To name and tag your image, use the following pattern:&nbsp;<code>&lt;name&gt;:&lt;tag&gt;</code>. This is usually translated into&nbsp;<code>&lt;username&gt;/&lt;repository&gt;:&lt;version&gt;</code>. The username corresponds to the username of the registry.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-create-a-container">How Do You Create A Container?</h2>
<div>
	<p>A container is a running image. You can run images with the CLI command&nbsp;<code>docker run &lt;image-name&gt;</code>:</p>
</div>




<div>
		<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-8" data-shcb-language-name="Bash" data-shcb-language-slug="bash"><code><span># start our image</span>

	</div>




<div>
	<p>Every Docker installation comes with a local registry. Docker stores your images here. First, the&nbsp;<code>docker run</code>&nbsp;command will look at the local registry and try to find the image. This will happen with our image, since we built it on the same machine we are executing the&nbsp;<code>docker run</code>&nbsp;command. If it does not find the image locally, it will take a look at the Docker Hub registry. You can also get images from other registries (e.g., your self-hosted registry). For that, you can use the URL of the self-hosted registry.</p>
</div>




<div>
		<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-9" data-shcb-language-name="Bash" data-shcb-language-slug="bash"><code><span># try to find an image on another registry</span>

	</div>




<div>
	<p>If you run an image, it starts in a foreground process. The container is running as a process in the terminal where you executed the&nbsp;<code>docker run</code>&nbsp;command. If you kill the terminal, it will stop the container immediately. To let your container run on your machine or server, you can run the container as a background process. In that way, you can close your terminal with no worries.</p>
</div>



<h3 id="how-do-you-run-containers-in-the-background">How Do You Run Containers In The Background?</h3>
<div>
	<p>The&nbsp;<code>--detached</code>&nbsp;(shorthand syntax:&nbsp;<code>-d</code>) flag will start containers in a background process:</p>

	</div>



<h3 id="how-do-you-stop-and-remove-containers">How Do You Stop And Remove Containers?</h3>
<div>
	<p>Occasionally, you would like to stop containers. When you stop containers, they are still on the system, you can start them again. If you wish to clean the container from the system, you will need to remove it. You can only remove a stopped container.</p>
</div>




<div>
		<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-13" data-shcb-language-name="Bash" data-shcb-language-slug="bash"><code><span># stop a container</span>
$ container stop &lt;container-id&gt;
<span># start a container</span>
$ container start &lt;container-id&gt;
<span># restart container</span>
$ container restart &lt;container-id&gt;

	</div>




<div>
	<p>If you wish to remove a container as soon as you stop it, you can pass the&nbsp;<code>--rm</code>&nbsp;flag when starting a container. Only use this if your container is stateless. If your container has its own state, make sure to use volumes to preserve it. Otherwise, all your data inside the container is lost when your container stops.</p>
</div>




<div>
		<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-14" data-shcb-language-name="Bash" data-shcb-language-slug="bash"><code><span># automatically remove a container after it stops</span>

<h3 id="what-if-i-killed-the-terminal-but-the-container-is-still-running">What If I Killed The Terminal, But The Container Is Still Running?</h3>
<div>
	<p>Sometimes signals are not passed to the container properly. Imagine you have killed your terminal because you could not stop the container with CTRL+C. But If you try to restart the container, it tells you that the port is already allocated. This means your old container is still running. To kill a container, run the following command:</p>
</div>




<div>
		<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-15" data-shcb-language-name="Bash" data-shcb-language-slug="bash"><code><span># kill a container</span>

	</div>



<h3 id="how-do-you-access-containers-from-the-host-system">How Do You Access Containers From The Host System?</h3>
<div>
	<p>Usually, a Docker container exposes one or many ports. You can access the application which is running inside the container via those ports. To have access to these ports, you need to publish those port during the container creation. Another way to access containers from the host system is by executing commands inside them. This is often used for debugging or single use container application.</p>
</div>



<h3 id="how-do-you-publish-ports">How Do You Publish Ports?</h3>
<div>
	<p>To expose the ports to the host system, you need to add the&nbsp;<code>--publish</code>&nbsp;(shorthand syntax:&nbsp;<code>-p</code>) flag.</p>
</div>




<div>
		<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-16" data-shcb-language-name="Bash" data-shcb-language-slug="bash"><code><span># publish ports, e.g., forward container port to a port on the host system</span>
$ docker run --publish 3000:3000 examplename/examplerepository-server:0.1.0
<span># or</span>
$ docker run --publish 80:80 examplename/examplerepository-server:0.1.0
<span># if you run both containers, the server and the client</span>
<span># and you visit the localhost:80 in your browser</span>
<span># you should see the message Hello World</span></code><small id="shcb-language-16"><span>Code language:</span> <span>Bash</span> <span>(</span><span>bash</span><span>)</span></small></pre>
	</div>




<div>
	<p>In the first example above, we bind the port 3000 from the container to the port 3000 on the host system. The host system is your development machine or your server. The format is the following&nbsp;<code>--publish &lt;hostport&gt;:&lt;containerport&gt;</code>.</p>
</div>



<h3 id="how-do-you-access-a-running-container">How Do You Access A Running Container?</h3>
<div>
	<p>Sometimes, you want access to a container. This can be beneficial for debugging.</p>
</div>




<div>
		<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-17" data-shcb-language-name="Bash" data-shcb-language-slug="bash"><code><span># access the container</span>
$ docker <span>exec</span> --interactive --tty &lt;container-id&gt; &lt;shell-command&gt;</code><small id="shcb-language-17"><span>Code language:</span> <span>Bash</span> <span>(</span><span>bash</span><span>)</span></small></pre>
	</div>




<div>
	<p><code>--interactive --tty</code>&nbsp;(shorthand syntax&nbsp;<code>-it</code>) instructs Docker to allocate a pseudo-TTY connection. In this way, the containers‚Äô stdin (standard input) creates an interactive shell in the container.</p>
</div>




<div>
	<p>You can execute any command that would be possible within the container. If you have a Debian container running, you would be able to list the directory:</p>
</div>




<div>
		<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-18" data-shcb-language-name="PHP" data-shcb-language-slug="php"><code><span># list the directory inside the container</span>
$ docker exec --interactive --tty &lt;container-id&gt; ls</code><small id="shcb-language-18"><span>Code language:</span> <span>PHP</span> <span>(</span><span>php</span><span>)</span></small></pre>
	</div>




<div>
	<p>You can even create a secure shell like connection with the following command:</p>
</div>




<div>
		<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-19" data-shcb-language-name="Bash" data-shcb-language-slug="bash"><code><span># SSH into the container (if the `sh` command exists in the container)</span>
$ docker <span>exec</span> --interactive --tty &lt;container-id&gt; sh
<span># this will keep the connection to the container open</span>
<span># and you can execute multiple commands within the container</span>
<span># to exit the container, run the following</span>
$ <span>exit</span></code><small id="shcb-language-19"><span>Code language:</span> <span>Bash</span> <span>(</span><span>bash</span><span>)</span></small></pre>
	</div>



<h2 id="how-do-you-persist-data-with-docker-volumes">How Do You Persist Data With Docker Volumes?</h2>
<div>
	<p>Data that is stored inside a container is not persisted by default. When you stop and remove a container, all data from this container is lost. In our application, if you click the button on the website (<a href="http://localhost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://localhost:80</a>) we will write ‚ÄúNew message‚Äù into a JSON file inside the container. Now if we stop and remove the container, all those messages are deleted as well.</p>
</div>




<div>
	<p>If you want to persist data between container starts, you need to use volumes. There are two different volume types: named volumes and mounted volumes. Named volumes are completely handled by Docker, a mounted volume is managed by you. For a mounted volume, you need to specify the location on the host system where this data will be stored. We use the&nbsp;<code>--volume</code>&nbsp;(shorthand&nbsp;<code>-v</code>) in our run command.</p>
</div>




<div>
		<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-20" data-shcb-language-name="Bash" data-shcb-language-slug="bash"><code><span># using a named volume</span>
<span># everything within this path of the container will be stored</span>
<span># in a volume named &lt;volume-name&gt;</span>
$ docker run --volume &lt;volume-name&gt;:/path/<span>in</span>/container &lt;image-name&gt;

<span># using a mounted volume</span>
<span># everything inside the path of the container will be stored </span>

	</div>




<div>
	<p>For our application, we need to use the following command for the server container:</p>
</div>




<div>
		<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-21" data-shcb-language-name="Bash" data-shcb-language-slug="bash"><code><span># create a volume called server-volume</span>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content">

	
<article id="post-3499">

	
<!-- .entry-header -->

	<div>

			
<p>This year‚Äôs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_of_Code">Advent of Code</a> has been brutal (compare the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/stats">stats of 2023</a> with <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2022/stats">that of 2022</a>, especially day 1 part 1 vs. day 1 part 2). It included a problem to solve with dynamic programming as soon as day 12, which discouraged some people I know. This specific problem was particularly gnarly for Advent of Code, with multiple special cases to take into account, making it basically intractable if you are not already familiar with dynamic programming.</p>



<p>However, dynamic programming itself is mostly natural when you understand what it does. And <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming#Algorithms_that_use_dynamic_programming">many common algorithms are actually just the application of dynamic programming to specific problems</a>, including omnipresent path-finding algorithms such as Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm.</p>



<p>This motivated me to write a gentler introduction and a detailed explanation of solving Day 12.</p>



<p>Let me start with a rant. You can <a href="#basic-caching">skip to the following section</a> if you want to get to the meat of the article.</p>



<h2>The Rant</h2>



<p>Software engineering is terrible at naming things.</p>



<ul>
<li>‚Äú<strong>Bootstrap</strong>‚Äù is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping">imaged expression to point to the absurdity and impossibility of a task</a>, but it has become synonymous with ‚Äústart‚Äù without providing any additional information, <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bootstrap#Verb">such as ‚Äúboot a computer‚Äù</a>. The illusion that it is actually meaningful had lead to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(disambiguation)">absurd level of polysemy</a>.</li>



<li>‚Äú<strong>Daemon</strong>‚Äù, for a process that is detached from your terminal</li>



<li>‚Äú<strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong>‚Äù, just to mean that properties can be overridden</li>



<li>‚Äú<strong>Cookie</strong>‚Äù, for a piece of data stored on the Web browser, which is automatically sent to the server</li>



<li>‚Äú<strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>‚Äù which is so vague it refers just as well to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system">if-conditions</a>, or to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">AGI</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Now, let‚Äôs take a look at ‚Äú<strong>dynamic programming</strong>‚Äù. What can we learn from the name? ‚Äú<strong>Programming</strong>‚Äù must refer to a style of programming, such as ‚Äúfunctional <em>programming</em>‚Äù, or maybe ‚Äútest-driven <em>development</em>‚Äù. Then, ‚Äú<strong>dynamic</strong>‚Äù could mean:</p>



<ul>
<li>like in <strong>dynamic typing</strong>, maybe it could refer to the more general idea of handling objects of arbitrary types, with techniques such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_function">virtual classes</a>, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch17-02-trait-objects.html">trait objects</a>, or a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html">base Object type</a>.</li>

<p>Guess what. It means nothing of that, and it has nothing to do with being ‚Äúdynamic‚Äù. It <em>is</em> an idea that you can use to design an algorithm, so there is a link to ‚Äúprogramming‚Äù; I will grant it that.</p>



<p>So, what <em>is</em> it?</p>



<h2 id="basic-caching">Basic Caching</h2>



<p>Let‚Äôs say we want to solve a problem by splitting it in smaller similar problems. Basically, a recursive function. Often, we end-up having to solve the same smaller problems many times.</p>



<p>The typical example is Fibonacci, where you want to evaluate <code>f(n)</code>, which is defined as <code>f(n - 1) + f(n - 2)</code>. If we implement it naively, we will end up evaluating f(1) many times:</p>



<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="925" height="404" src="https://qsantos.fr/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image.png" alt=""><figcaption>Call tree for evaluating f(6), the 6-th Fibonacci number. To evaluate, f(6), we need to evaluate both f(5) and f(4). To evaluate f(5), we will need f(4) and f(3). Already, we see that we are going to need f(4) in two places. If we go further, we see that we will need f(1) 8 eight times, which happens to be f(6).</figcaption></figure>



<p>In fact, in this case, since only <code>f(1)</code> adds anything to the overall result, the number of times we will need <code>f(1)</code> is equal to <code>f(n)</code>. And <code>f(n)</code> grows very fast as <code>n</code> grows.</p>



<p>Of course, we can avoid doing this. We can just cache the results (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization">memoize</a> <code>f</code>, in terrible academic vernacular).</p>



<p>In the example, once we have evaluated <code>f(4)</code> once, there is no need to evaluate it again, saving 3 evaluations of <code>f(1)</code>. By doing the same for <code>f(3)</code> and <code>f(2)</code>, we get down to 2 evaluations of <code>f(1)</code>. In total, <code>f(‚Ä¶)</code> is evaluated 7 times (<code>f(0)</code>, <code>f(1)</code>, <code>f(2)</code>, <code>f(3)</code>, <code>f(4)</code>, <code>f(5)</code>, <code>f(6)</code>), which is just f(n) + 1.</p>



<p>This is theoretically (<em>asymptotically</em>) optimal. But we can look at this in a different way.</p>



<h2>Optimized Caching</h2>



<p>With memoization, we keep the recursion: ‚Äúto solve <code>f(6)</code>, I need <code>f(5)</code>, which will itself need <code>f(4)</code> [‚Ä¶] and <code>f(3)</code> [‚Ä¶], and <code>f(4)</code>, which will itself need <code>f(3)</code> [‚Ä¶] and <code>f(2)</code> [‚Ä¶].‚Äù. Basically, we figure out what we need just when we need them.</p>



<p>Instead, we can make the simple observation that we will need <em>f(0)</em> and <em>f(1)</em> for all other evaluations of <em>f(‚Ä¶)</em>. Once we have them, we can evaluate <em>f(2)</em>, which will need for all <em>other</em> evaluations of <em>f(‚Ä¶)</em>. </p>



<p>You can think of it as plucking the leaves (the nodes without descendants) from the call tree we saw before, and repeat until there are no more nodes. In other words, perform a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">topological sort</a>.</p>



<p>With the example, if we have some array F where we can store our partial results:</p>



<ul>
<li>F[0] = f(0) = 0</li>



<li>F[1] = f(1) = 1</li>



<li>F[2] = f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = F[1] + F[0] = 1 + 0 = 1</li>



<li>F[3] = f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = F[2] + F[1] = 1 + 1 = 2</li>



<li>F[4] = f(4) = f(3) + f(2) = F[3] + F[2] = 2 + 1 = 3</li>



<li>F[5] = f(5) = f(4) + f(3) = F[4] + F[3] = 3 + 2 = 5</li>



<li>F[6] = f(6) = f(5) + f(4) = F[5] + F[4] = 5 + 3 = 8</li>
</ul>



<p>With this approach, we do not have any recursive call anymore. And <em>that</em> is <strong>dynamic programming</strong>.</p>



<p>It also forces us to think clearly about what information we will be storing. In fact, in the case of Fibonacci we can notice that we only need the two last previous values. In other words:</p>



<ul>
<li>F[0] = f(0) = 0</li>



<li>F[1] = f(1) = 1</li>



<li>F[2] = f(2) = previous + previous_previous = 1 + 0 = 1</li>



<li>F[3] = f(3) = previous + previous_previous = 1 + 1 = 2</li>



<li>F[4] = f(4) = previous + previous_previous = 2 + 1 = 3</li>



<li>F[5] = f(5) = previous + previous_previous = 3 + 2 = 5</li>



<li>F[6] = f(6) = previous + previous_previous = 5 + 3 = 8</li>
</ul>



<p>So, we can discard other values and just keep two of them. Doing this in Python, we get:</p>



<pre><code lang="python">def fibo(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    previous_previous = 0
    previous = 1
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        current = previous_previous + previous
        (previous, previous_previous) = (current, previous)
    return previous
</code></pre>



<p>I like that this gives us a natural and systematic progression from the mathematical definition of the Fibonacci function, to the iterative implementation (not the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence#Matrix_form">optimal one</a>, though).</p>



<p>Now, Fibonacci is more of a toy example. Let‚Äôs have a look at </p>



<h2>Edit Distance</h2>



<p>The edit distance between two strings is the smallest number of edits needed to transform one string into the other one.</p>



<p>There are actually several versions, depending on what you count as an ‚Äúedit‚Äù. For instance, if you only allow replacing a character by another, you get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance">Hamming distance</a>; evaluating the Hamming distance between two strings is algorithmically very simple.</p>



<p>Things become more interesting if you allow insertion and deletion of characters as well. This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Levenstein distance</a>. Considering this title of the present article, this is of course something that can be solved efficiently using ‚ú®&nbsp;dynamic programming&nbsp;‚ú®.</p>



<p>To do that, we‚Äôll need to find how we can derive a full solution from solutions to smaller-problems. Let‚Äôs say we have two strings: <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>. We‚Äôll note <code>d(X, Y)</code> the edit distance between strings <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code>, and we‚Äôll note <code>x</code> the length of string <code>X</code>. We need to formulate <code>d(A, B)</code> from any combination of d(X, Y) where <code>X</code> is a substring of <code>A</code> and <code>Y</code> a substring of <code>B</code><sup data-fn="4598dbdf-9a33-4bd6-976e-a06758eb4f07"><a href="#4598dbdf-9a33-4bd6-976e-a06758eb4f07" id="4598dbdf-9a33-4bd6-976e-a06758eb4f07-link">1</a></sup>.</p>



<p>We‚Äôre going to look at a single character. We‚Äôll use the last one. The first one would work just as well but using a middle one would not be as convenient. So, let‚Äôs look at A[a ‚Äì 1] and B[b ‚Äì 1] (using zero-indexing). We have four cases:</p>



<ul>
<li><code>A[a - 1] == B[b - 1]</code>, then we can ignore that character and look at the rest, so <code>d(A, B) = d(A[0..a&nbsp;-&nbsp;1],&nbsp;B[0..b&nbsp;-&nbsp;1])</code></li>



<li><code>A[a - 1] != B[b - 1]</code>, then we could apply any of the three rules.  Since we want the smallest number of edits, we‚Äôll need to select the smallest value given by applying each rule:
<ul>
<li><strong>substitute</strong> the last character of A by that of B, in which case <code>d(A,&nbsp;B) = d(A[0..a&nbsp;-&nbsp;1],&nbsp;B[0..b&nbsp;-&nbsp;1])&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</code></li>



<li><strong>delete</strong> the last character of <code>A</code>, in which case <code>d(A,&nbsp;B) = d(A[0..a&nbsp;-&nbsp;1],&nbsp;B)&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</code></li>



<li><strong>insert</strong> the last character of <code>B</code>, in which case <code>d(A,&nbsp;B) = d(A,&nbsp;B[0..b&nbsp;-&nbsp;1])&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</code></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>A is actually empty (<code>a = 0</code>), then we need to <strong>insert</strong> all characters from B<sup data-fn="fb0dcaf1-f2c3-4035-aa3e-9d14652cb2fa"><a href="#fb0dcaf1-f2c3-4035-aa3e-9d14652cb2fa" id="fb0dcaf1-f2c3-4035-aa3e-9d14652cb2fa-link">2</a></sup>, so <code>d(A, B) = b</code></li>



<li>B is actually empty (b = 0), then we need to <strong>delete</strong> all characters from A, so <code>d(A, B) = a</code></li>
</ul>



<p>By translating this directly to Python, we get:</p>



<pre><code lang="python">def levenstein(A: str, B: str) -&gt; int:
    a = len(A)
    b = len(B)
    if a == 0:
        return b
    elif b == 0:
        return a
    elif A[a - 1] == B[b - 1]:
        return levenstein(A[:a - 1], B[:b - 1])
    else:
        return min([
            levenstein(A[:a - 1], B[:b - 1]) + 1,
            levenstein(A[:a - 1], B) + 1,
            levenstein(A, B[:b - 1]) + 1,
        ])


assert levenstein("", "puppy") == 5
assert levenstein("kitten", "sitting") == 3
assert levenstein("uninformed", "uniformed") == 1
# way too slow!
# assert levenstein("pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis", "sisoinoconaclovociliscipocsorcimartluonomuenp") == 36</code></pre>



<p>As hinted by the last test, this version becomes very slow when comparing long strings with lots of differences. In Fibonnacci, we were doubling the number of instances for each level in the call tree; here, we are tripling it!</p>



<p>In Python, we can easily apply memoization:</p>



<pre><code lang="python">from functools import cache

@cache
def levenstein(A: str, B: str) -&gt; int:
    a = len(A)
    b = len(B)
    if a == 0:
        return b
    elif b == 0:
        return a
    elif A[a - 1] == B[b - 1]:
        return levenstein(A[:a - 1], B[:b - 1])
    else:
        return min([
            levenstein(A[:a - 1], B[:b - 1]) + 1,
            levenstein(A[:a - 1], B) + 1,
            levenstein(A, B[:b - 1]) + 1,
        ])


assert levenstein("", "puppy") == 5
assert levenstein("kitten", "sitting") == 3
assert levenstein("uninformed", "uniformed") == 1
# instantaneous!
assert levenstein("pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis", "sisoinoconaclovociliscipocsorcimartluonomuenp") == 36</code></pre>



<p>Now, there is something that makes the code nicer, and more performant, but it is not technically necessary. The trick is that we do not actually need to create new strings in our recursive functions. We can just pass arounds the lengths of the substrings, and always refer to the original strings <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>. Then, our code becomes:</p>



<pre><code lang="python">from functools import cache

def levenstein(A: str, B: str) -&gt; int:
    @cache
    def aux(a: int, b: int) -&gt; int:
        if a == 0:
            return b
        elif b == 0:
            return a
        elif A[a - 1] == B[b - 1]:
            return aux(a - 1, b - 1)
        else:
            return min([
                aux(a - 1, b - 1) + 1,
                aux(a - 1, b) + 1,
                aux(a, b - 1) + 1,
            ])
    return aux(len(A), len(B))


assert levenstein("", "puppy") == 5
assert levenstein("kitten", "sitting") == 3
assert levenstein("uninformed", "uniformed") == 1
# instantaneous!
assert levenstein("pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis", "sisoinoconaclovociliscipocsorcimartluonomuenp") == 36</code></pre>



<p>The next step is to build the cache ourselves:</p>



<pre><code lang="python">def levenstein(A: str, B: str) -&gt; int:
    # cache[a][b] = levenstein(A[:a], B[:b])
    # note the + 1 so that we can actually do cache[len(A)][len(B)]
    # the list comprehension ensures we create independent rows, not references to the same one
    cache = [[None] * (len(B) + 1) for _ in range(len(A) + 1)]
    def aux(a: int, b: int) -&gt; int:
        if cache[a][b] == None:
            if a == 0:
                cache[a][b] = b
            elif b == 0:
                cache[a][b] = a
            elif A[a - 1] == B[b - 1]:
                cache[a][b] = aux(a - 1, b - 1)

                    aux(a - 1, b) + 1,
                    aux(a, b - 1) + 1,

<p>The last thing we need to do is to replace the recursion with iterations. The important thing is to make sure we do that in the right order<sup data-fn="1d71982a-5567-4481-b278-15d8251bcee6"><a href="#1d71982a-5567-4481-b278-15d8251bcee6" id="1d71982a-5567-4481-b278-15d8251bcee6-link">3</a></sup>:</p>

<p>Now, if you really want to grok dynamic programming, I invite you to try it yourself on the following problems, preferrably in this order:</p>

<p>Once you are comfortable with dynamic programming, Day 12 should become much less daunting!</p>



<h2>Advent of Code, Day 12</h2>



<p>In the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/12">Advent of Code of December 12th, 2023</a>, you have to solve 1D <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram">nonograms</a>. Rather than rephrasing the problem, I will let you read the official description.</p>



<pre><code>.??..??...?##. 1,1,3</code></pre>



<p>This can be solved by brute-force. The proper technique for that is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking">backtracking</a>, another terrible name. But the asymptotic complexity is exponential (for n question marks, we have to evaluate 2<sup>n</sup> potential solutions). Let‚Äôs see how it goes with this example:</p>



<ul>
<li><code>.??..??...?##. 1,1,3</code> the first question mark could be either a <code>.</code> or a <code>#</code>; in the second case, we ‚Äúconsume‚Äù the first group of size 1, and the second question mark has to be a <code>.</code>
<ol>
<li><code>..?..??...?##. 1,1,3</code> the next question mark could be either a . or a #; in the second case, we ‚Äúconsume‚Äù the first group of size 1, and the next character has to be a ., which is the case
<ol>
<li><code>.....??...?##. 1,1,3</code> the backtracking algorithm will continue to explore the 8 cases, but none of them is a valid solution</li>



<li><code>..#..??...?##. (1),1,3</code>
<ul>
<li>and so on‚Ä¶</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>



<li><code>.#...??...?##. (1),1,3</code>
<ul>
<li>and so on‚Ä¶</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>



<p>There are 32 candidates, which would make 63 list items. I‚Äôll spare you that. Instead, I want to draw your attention to the items 2.2 and 2:</p>



<ul>
<li>2.2. <code>..#..??...?##. <code>(1),</code>1,3</code></li>



<li>2. <code>.#...??...?##. <code>(1),</code>1,3</code></li>
</ul>



<p>They are extremely similar. In fact, if we discard the part that has already been accounted for, they are more like:</p>



<ul>
<li>2.2. <code>.??...?##. 1,3</code></li>



<li>2. <code>..??...?##. 1,3</code></li>
</ul>



<p>There is an extra <code>.</code> on the second one, but we can clearly see that it is actually the same problem, and has the same solutions.</p>



<p>In other words, just like with Fibonacci, the total number of cases is huge, but many of them will just be repeats of other ones. So we are going to apply memoization. And then, dynamic programming.</p>



<p>When we implement the ‚Äúbacktracking‚Äù algorithm we‚Äôve overviewed above, we get something like this (<a href="https://github.com/Domyy95/Challenges/blob/02e9e5535b7ba027c11bb0e27fe3f2ce5dbd7d38/2023-12-Advent-of-code/12.py#L61-L79">not my code</a>):</p>



<pre><code lang="python">def count_arrangements(conditions, rules):
    if not rules:
        return 0 if "#" in conditions else 1
    if not conditions:
        return 1 if not rules else 0

    result = 0

    if conditions[0] in ".?":
        result += count_arrangements(conditions[1:], rules)
    if conditions[0] in "#?":
        if (
            rules[0] &lt;= len(conditions)
            and "." not in conditions[: rules[0]]
            and (rules[0] == len(conditions) or conditions[rules[0]] != "#")
        ):
            result += count_arrangements(conditions[rules[0] + 1 :], rules[1:])

    return result</code></pre>



<p>Note the program above handles <code>?</code> by treating it as both <code>.</code> and <code>#</code>. The first case is easy, but the second case need to check that it matches the next rules; and for that, it needs to check that there is a separator afterwards, or the end of the string.</p>



<p>Since it‚Äôs Python, to memoize, we just need to add <code>@cache</code>.</p>



<p>To make it dynamic programing, we use the same trick as in the example of the edit distance: we pass the offset in the string, and the offset in the rules as parameters in the recursion. This becomes:</p>



<pre><code lang="python">def count_arrangements(conditions, rules):
    @cache
    def aux(i, j):
        if not rules[j:]:
            return 0 if "#" in conditions[i:] else 1
        if not conditions[i:]:
            return 1 if not rules[j:] else 0

        result = 0

        if conditions[i] in ".?":
            result += aux(i + 1, j)
        if conditions[i] in "#?":
            if (
                rules[j] &lt;= len(conditions[i:])
                and "." not in conditions[i:i + rules[j]]
                and (rules[j] == len(conditions[i:]) or conditions[i + rules[j]] != "#")
            ):
                result += aux(i + rules[j] + 1, j + 1)

        return result
    return aux(0, 0)</code></pre>



<p>Then, we implement our own cache and fill it in the right order:</p>



<pre><code lang="python">def count_arrangements(conditions, rules):
    cache = [[0] * (len(rules) + 1) for _ in range(len(conditions) + 1)]
    # note that we are in the indices in reverse order here
    for i in reversed(range(0, len(conditions) + 1)):
        for j in reversed(range(0, len(rules) + 1)):
            if not rules[j:]:
                result = 0 if "#" in conditions[i:] else 1
            elif not conditions[i:]:
                result = 1 if not rules[j:] else 0
            else:
                result = 0
                if conditions[i] in ".?":
                    # since we are at row i, we already filled in row i + 1
                    result += cache[i + 1][j]
                if conditions[i] in "#?":
                    if (
                        rules[j] &lt;= len(conditions[i:])
                        and "." not in conditions[i:i + rules[j]]
                    ):
                        if rules[j] == len(conditions[i:]):
                            # since we are at row i, we already filled in row i + rules[j] &gt; i
                            result += cache[i + rules[j]][j + 1]
                        elif conditions[i + rules[j]] != "#":
                            # since we are at row i, we already filled in row i + rules[j] + 1 &gt; i
                            result += cache[i + rules[j] + 1][j + 1]
            cache[i][j] = result
    return cache[0][0]</code></pre>



<p>And, voil√†! You can also have a look at a <a href="https://github.com/qsantos/advent-of-code/blob/master/2023/day12/src/main.rs#L6-L46">Rust implementation (my code, this time)</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> In this case, it looks like the dynamic programming version is slower than the memoized one. But that‚Äôs probably due to it being written in unoptimized Python.</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> Independently from using a faster language and micro-optimizations, the dynamic programming version allows us to see that we only need the previous column. Thus, we could replace the 2D array by two 1D arrays (one for the previous column, and one for the column being filled).</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I‚Äôll concede that dynamic programming is not trivial. But it is far from being unreachable for most programmers. Being able to understand how to split a problem in smaller problems will enable you to use memoization in various contexts, which is already a huge improvement above a naive implementation.</p>



<p>However, mastering dynamic programming will let us understand a whole class of algorithms, better understand trade-offs, and make other optimizations possible. So, if you have not already done them, I strongly encourage you to practice on these problems:</p>



<ol>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence">longest common subsequence</a> (not to be confused with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_substring">longest common <em>substring</em></a>, but you can do that one too with dynamic programming)</li>



<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_wrap_and_word_wrap">line warp</a></li>



<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem">subset sum</a></li>



<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_problem">partition</a></li>



<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem">knapsack</a></li>
</ol>



<p>And don‚Äôt forget to benchmark and profile your code!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        
    <ul>
<li>Company sent 79 million spam emails and 1 million spam texts in seven months</li>
<li>Customers were not fully aware of what they were opting into, marking a ‚Äúclear breach of trust‚Äù</li>
<li>‚ÄúWe will take clear and decisive action where we find the law has not been followed.‚Äù - ICO</li>
</ul>
<p>The Information Commissioner‚Äôs Office (ICO) has <a data-udi="umb://document/43b8cac81c294f9aa3ac7c9835b11752" href="https://ico.org.uk/action-weve-taken/enforcement/grocery-delivery-e-services-uk-ltd-ta-hellofresh/" title="Grocery Delivery E-Services UK Ltd t/a HelloFresh" data-anchor="#">fined food delivery company HelloFresh ¬£140,000 for a campaign of 79 million spam emails and 1 million spam texts over a seven-month period</a>.</p>
<p>The marketing messages were sent based on an opt-in statement which did not make any reference to the sending of marketing via text. Whilst there was a reference to marketing via email, this was included in an age confirmation statement which was likely to unfairly incentivise customers to agree.</p>
<p>Customers were also not given sufficient information that their data would continue to be used for marketing purposes for up to 24 months after cancelling their subscriptions.</p>
<p>An investigation by the ICO began in March 2022 following complaints made directly to the regulator, as well as to the 7726 spam message reporting service. As part of this investigation, it was also discovered that the company continued to contact some individuals even after they had requested this to stop.</p>
<p>Following the investigation, we found that the company (Grocery Delivery E-Services UK Limited) contravened regulation 22 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 and it has now been served with a fine of ¬£140,000.</p>
<p>Andy Curry, Head of Investigations at the Information Commissioner's Office, said:</p>
<blockquote><span><span></span></span>
<p>‚ÄúThis marked a clear breach of trust of the public by HelloFresh. Customers weren‚Äôt told exactly what they‚Äôd be opting into, nor was it clear how to opt out. From there, they were hit with a barrage of marketing texts they didn't want or expect, and in some cases, even when they told HelloFresh to stop, the deluge continued.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn issuing this fine, we are showing that we will take clear and decisive action where we find the law has not been followed. We will always protect the right of customers to choose how their data is used.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe investigation that led to this fine began following complaints filed by the public, both to the ICO and to the 7726 service. This shows just how important it is that if you are being contacted with nuisance calls, texts or emails, that you report it straight away.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Further details of contraventions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Between 23 August 2021 and 23 February 2022 there were 80,893,013 direct marketing messages comprised of 79,779,279 emails and 1,113,734 SMS messages received by subscribers. The Commissioner found that HelloFresh transmitted those messages contrary to Regulation 22 of PECR.</li>
<li>The consent statement for these messages did not meet the requirement that it be ‚Äúspecific‚Äù and ‚Äúinformed‚Äù, as it did not mention SMS, was unclear and bundled with other aspects, and did not highlight that customers would receive messages for 24 months after they cancelled their HelloFresh subscription.</li>
<li>This therefore meant that 80,893,013 direct marketing messages were sent by HelloFresh that lacked proper consent.</li>
<li>8,729 complaints were logged with the 7726 service in relation to messages from HelloFresh. Additionally, the ICO received 14 complaints about unauthorised SMS messages from HelloFresh and three complaints about marketing emails.</li>
</ul>
<h2>ICO‚Äôs work to tackle nuisance communications</h2>
<p>The ICO enforces the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (PECR), which cover the rules for organisations wishing to make direct marketing calls, texts or emails.</p>
<p>We have issued more than ¬£2,440,000 million in fines against companies responsible for nuisance calls, texts and emails since April 2023. Some of these investigations began with a single complaint from a member of the public.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><h2 id="d1711058e1">ABSTRACT</h2></p><p>When writing a distributed application, conventional wisdom says to split your application into separate services that can be rolled out independently. This approach is well-intentioned, but a microservices-based architecture like this often backfires, introducing challenges that counteract the benefits the architecture tries to achieve. Fundamentally, this is because microservices conflate logical boundaries (how code is written) with physical boundaries (how code is deployed). In this paper, we propose a different programming methodology that decouples the two in order to solve these challenges. With our approach, developers write their applications as logical monoliths, offload the decisions of how to distribute and run applications to an automated runtime, and deploy applications atomically. Our prototype implementation reduces application latency by up to 15√ó and reduces cost by up to 9√ó compared to the status quo.</p></div><div data-widget-def="UX3TagWidget" data-widget-id="2a75f978-170a-4843-8722-e878a1b77fbc">

Since launch we‚Äôve accepted code from over 500 contributors and swapped ideas with thousands of users in our public Slack group. </p><p>Now, though, we‚Äôre closing that Slack group in favor of creating a better, more scalable, and helpful PostHog community <a href="https://posthog.com/questions">here on our site</a>. In this post, I‚Äôll explain why we‚Äôre doing this, and what comes next. </p><blockquote><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> We‚Äôre closing the Slack group on Jan 24 2024 and inviting members to join the 1,500 users who have already moved to the <a href="https://posthog.com/questions">new community forum</a>. As thanks you'll receive a unique community achievement when you create an account. This decision only impacts the public Slack group, not private Slack channels for users who pay for additional support.</p></blockquote><p>PostHog has grown incredibly fast over the last four years, and throughout that time the public Slack group has been the central hub of our community. It's been a place where we chat to users, listen to feature requests, answer questions, and solicit feedback. </p><p>However, with over 5,000 members in the community, it's become clear we've outgrown Slack as a platform. Messages quickly disappear from the chat history, it is disconnected from our main support flow, and useful solutions aren't searchable on our site or via Google. </p><p>We've explored a few things to fix this, including joining a paid plan ($7.25+ per user, per month) and <a href="https://posthog.com/blog/aruba-hackathon#maxai-our-friendly-posthog-support-ai">building our own AI bot</a>, but earlier this year we realized a new approach was needed.</p><p>So, we decided to build something better. </p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/blqgFrIaWY0?si=gSj1eNrGQ8l0ANlw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>Rather than using an off-the-shelf forum platform, like vBulletin or phpBB, we decided to create our own forum using Strapi as a headless CMS. The forum has already been live for several months while we worked out the kinks, and has over 1,500 active members. </p><p>The new forum provides a dedicated area where you can post questions for both the PostHog team and the wider community. Anyone can respond, and answers can be selected as the preferred solution to help guide other users in the future. All of this content is connected to our main support flow, lives permanently on our website, and is visible to search engines, which is enough on its own to make the forums a better place for seeking community support.</p><p>We've also integrated the forum into other parts of the site. You can, for example, post questions when browsing the PostHog docs, and we'll automatically aggregate them into sortable categories. This is especially helpful if you're following a guide and something isn't clear enough for you - just pop a question on it and we'll take a look.</p><p>Profiles are also a big part of the forum; a place where you can add info, track discussions you're involved in, and display achievements earned through the community. In fact, we're giving everyone who joins the PostHog community from the public Slack a unique achievement to say thanks for the support!</p><p>You can even open your profile to function as an Ask Me Anything (AMA) - something <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://posthog.com/community/profiles/71" target="">James</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://posthog.com/community/profiles/2" target="">Cory</a>, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://posthog.com/community/profiles/59" target="">myself</a> have already done.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Ready to join the community?</strong> <a href="https://posthog.com/questions">Create an account today</a> and, if you've previously signed up to the public Slack group, you'll get a unique achievement to display on your community profile!</p></blockquote><h2 id="what-happens-next"><span></span>What happens next?</h2><p>One option for the public Slack would have been to just leaving it running in parallel to the forums, but that would leave Slack users in limbo. Instead, we'll close the Slack in favor of the PostHog community forum. Currently you need to create an account to sign-up to the community, but soon we'll merge this with your normal PostHog account. </p><p>On January 12, we'll archive all channels in the public PostHog Slack, so that no new discussion or replies can be posted. This will give you chance to move on-going conversations to a new location, such as the PostHog community, without losing anything. </p><p>A week later, on January 22, we'll close the Slack group permanently and delete all existing content. </p><p><strong>Important:</strong> Private Slack channels for paying users will continue to function as normal via Slack Connect, and we‚Äôll continue to handle the majority of customer support via the in-app help. Obviously, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/PostHog/" target="">GitHub repos</a> will also continue to function as normal and you can add comments or submit there too.  </p><p>Thank you to everyone who participated in the Slack group over the last four years. Your support and feedback has helped us immensely, and we‚Äôve deeply enjoyed speaking with you. We very much hope that all of you will <a href="https://posthog.com/questions">join us in the new community soon</a>!</p></div></div>]]></description>

          <p>When using DNS over HTTPS in Firefox, /etc/hosts is ignored by the browser. I consider this
a nuisance side effect of forcing any ISP surveillance to use raw IP addresses and look them
up themselves (which automated snooping may not bother with) as it makes blocking things
like Facebook, Google, and their embedded content more difficult.</p>

<p dir="auto">A funny thing to note here is that the image link, which first points at nitter.it, is a /enc/ link which only gets created by Nitter if the instance admin enables base64 link encoding for media proxying. This is not enabled for nitter.net, so I know for a fact someone copied an image from another instance (presumably nitter.it), changed the domain, and sent a complaint to Njalla.</p>

  <p>Researchers were able to trace a form of the autoimmune disease lupus back to a single mutation<br>&nbsp;</p>
  

  

  <p>Sometimes a single mutation in our genetic make-up is enough to cause disease. This is also the case with the autoimmune disease lupus. Lupus causes severe inflammation throughout the body and can have a serious impact on the lives of those affected. Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Berlin have now discovered a mechanism that can trigger lupus in children. This mechanism regulates the amount of a specific immune receptor that normally recognizes the genetic material of pathogens. If this mechanism is disrupted, receptors accumulate in the immune cells leading to the recognition of the body's own genetic material. As a result, the immune system turns against its own body and causes the systemic inflammation of lupus. In collaboration with physicians from the Hospital of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, the researchers were able to identify a lupus patient in whom this mechanism is disrupted by a single mutation.</p>
  
  
<figure data-description="In this cell, Toll-like receptor 7 was stained pink in order to analyse its amount and position under the microscope. The cell is healthy and the amount of Toll-like receptor is normal.

<p>The innate immune system responds to invading pathogens within minutes. It is an initial line of defence that keeps pathogens at bay until the more specific adaptive immune system kicks in. However, this speed comes at a price: the innate immune system‚Äôs response is so strong and unspecific that it must be well controlled to prevent it from turning against the body itself.</p><p>In Olivia Majer‚Äôs group at the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology, researchers are working to better understand these control mechanisms of the innate immune system. The group is focusing on an immune receptor called Toll-like receptor 7, which can recognize the genetic material of viruses and bacteria and then triggers an immune response against the invaders.</p><h2>Immune receptor out of balance</h2><p>In order for the immune system to react quickly, a certain number of these receptors must be present in the immune cells. Cells maintain this balance by constantly producing and degrading receptors. ‚ÄúWe wanted to understand what happens when this balance is disturbed,‚Äù explains group leader Olivia Majer.</p><p>During their work, Majers‚Äô team became interested in a protein complex called BORC. The researchers were able to show that BORC is required to degrade Toll-like receptor 7 within the cell. In addition, BORC needs another protein, UNC93B1, to carry out the degradation process correctly. If there is an error in this process, the receptor is not degraded and accumulates in the immune cells. ‚ÄúFrom earlier experiments in mice carried out a few years ago at the University of Berkeley in California, we already knew that too many of these receptors are a problem,‚Äù explains Majer. A greater amount of receptor biases towards recognizing the body‚Äôs own genetic material. This leads to an immune response against self, a trigger for the autoimmune disease lupus. So far, however, neither BORC nor UNC93B1 have been associated with lupus in humans.</p><p>The researchers received confirmation of their findings by phone. Fabian Hauck teaches, researches and treats patients at the Ludwig Maximilian University Hospital in Munich, and specialises in congenital immune disorders such as lupus. He became aware of Majer's research because one of his patients had a mutation in the gene for a previously unnoticed protein: UNC93B1. It was precisely this protein that Majer had identified with her team. ‚ÄúWhen I got the first call from Fabian Hauck, I thought it was too good to be true,‚Äù says Majer, ‚Äúbut within eight busy weeks of joined effort, we were able to confirm that the mutation in UNC93B1 was the cause of this patient‚Äôs lupus.‚Äù</p><h2>A new approach for lupus therapies</h2><p>Hauck and Majer‚Äôs findings have now been published in the prestigious journal Science Immunology. At the same time, the journal also published the work of a research group at the Technical University of Dresden, with whom the two researchers collaborate. In their study, the Dresden scientists identified additional UNC93B1 mutations that can trigger lupus. The researchers have uncovered a completely new mechanism that triggers a particularly aggressive form of lupus: severe symptoms develop as early as infancy, while many other forms of lupus only appear in adults.</p><p>Testing for mutations in UNC93B1 could quickly become part of lupus treatment, opening up new approaches to therapy. In the past, doctors have mainly focussed on suppressing inflammation with drugs. By targeting the mechanism that has now been discovered, it may be possible to prevent the inflammation from developing in the first place‚Äîand thus significantly reduce the disease burden for those affected.</p>

If the NSA ever did do this on a large enough scale or to target a particularly notable person, it's very unlikely it would be kept a secret for long, and the end-business that used Cloudflare et al. wouldn't be implicated whatsoever since every business uses one of the big CDN providers.

            <guid>38985409</guid>
            <pubDate>Sat, 13 Jan 2024 22:44:14 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://beyondloom.com/decker/">https://beyondloom.com/decker/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38985409">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><h2>Decker</h2>

<p>Decker is a multimedia platform for creating and sharing interactive documents, with sound, images, hypertext, and scripted behavior. You can try it in your web browser <b><a href="https://beyondloom.com/decker/tour.html">right now</a></b>.</p>

<center>
	<a href="https://beyondloom.com/decker/tour.html"><img src="https://beyondloom.com/decker/images/wings.gif"></a>
</center>

<p>Decker builds on the legacy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard">HyperCard</a> and the visual aesthetic of classic MacOS. It retains the simplicity and ease of learning that HyperCard provided, while adding many subtle and overt quality-of-life improvements, like deep undo history, support for scroll wheels and touchscreens, more modern keyboard navigation, and bulk editing operations.</p>

<p>Anyone can use Decker to create E-Zines, organize their notes, give presentations, build adventure games, or even just doodle some 1-bit pixel art. The holistic "ditherpunk" aesthetic is cozy, a bit nostalgic, and provides fun and distinctive creative constraints. As a prototyping tool, Decker encourages embracing a sketchy, imperfect approach. Finished decks can be saved as standalone <fixed>.html</fixed> documents which self-execute in a web browser and can be shared anywhere you can host or embed a web page. Decker also runs natively on MacOS, Windows, and Linux.</p>

<p>For more complex projects, Decker features a novel scripting language named <i>Lil</i> which is strongly influenced by both <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>, an imperative language popular for embedding in tools and game engines, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_%28programming_language_from_Kx_Systems%29">Q</a>, a functional language in the APL family used with time-series databases. Lil is easy to learn and conventional enough not to ruffle any feathers for users with prior programming experience, but also includes pleasant surprises like implicit scalar-vector arithmetic and an integrated SQL-like query language. A few lines of Lil can go a long way.</p>

<center>
	<img src="https://beyondloom.com/decker/images/calc.gif">
</center>

<p>Decker provides a small collection of built-in interactive widgets for building interfaces, as well as a facility for <a href="https://beyondloom.com/decker/decker.html#customwidgets">defining new ones</a>. Custom widgets and their definitions can be copied and pasted using the system clipboard, which also makes it possible to share them anywhere you can share or store text. Every deck is a toolkit of reusable parts that can be harvested and repurposed for another project.</p>

<center>
	<img src="https://beyondloom.com/decker/images/contrap.gif">
</center>

<p>Decker is command-line friendly: when built from source, it comes with <a href="https://beyondloom.com/decker/lilt.html">Lilt</a>, a standalone Lil interpreter which can (among other things) read, write, manipulate, and even execute Decker documents "headlessly". Lilt has even fewer dependencies than Decker itself, so it can also be compiled as a cross-platform <a href="https://justine.lol/ape.html">APE executable</a>, ready for writing run-anywhere shell scripts. Decks are stored in a line-oriented text format which interoperates well with existing source control tools like Git and SVN.</p>

<p>Decker includes no advertising, telemetry, gamification, or other intrusions on user privacy and autonomy. If you like Decker, please share it with other people who might enjoy it. Build something that makes you happy.</p>

He regards these statements as a gravely concerning trend for his discipline, and he wanted to register some sort of protest against them.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Painful experiences long ago convinced Barvinok that requirements to affirm any ideal are corrosive in academia.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">‚ÄúI grew up in the Soviet Union, where people had to affirm their fealty to ideals, and the leaders embodying those ideals, on a daily basis,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúAs years went by, I observed the remarkable ease with which passionate communists turned first into passionate pro-Western liberals and then into passionate nationalists. This lived experience and also common sense convince me that only true conformists excel in this game. Do we really want our math departments to be populated by conformists?‚Äù</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/hypocrisy-mandatory-diversity-statements/674611/">Conor Friedersdorf: The hypocrisy of mandatory diversity statements</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Barvinok insists that it isn‚Äôt diversity to which he objects. Any coerced statement, he says, would trouble him as much. ‚ÄúEven if one is required to say ‚ÄòI passionately believe that water would certainly wet us, as fire would certainly burn,‚Äô‚Äù he <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://community.ams.org/journals/notices/202307/rnoti-p1045.pdf?adat=August%202023&amp;trk=2736&amp;cat=news&amp;galt=none&amp;fbclid=IwAR3-5xzXnheXkTyAgqosw4Aj_jF70mKdpIEO9BcK2VtInZMDpr7uDsWu8o0">wrote</a> in his resignation letter, ‚Äúthe routine affirmation of one‚Äôs beliefs as a precondition of making a living constitutes compelled speech and corrupts everyone who participates in the performance.‚Äù</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Anytime an immigrant who experienced the Soviet Union frets about growing ideological coercion in the United States, I pay attention. No one knows more about what it feels like when the noble goal of social justice is invoked in ways that coerce and corrupt rather than improve, and I was curious how Barvinok would compare and contrast the different academic cultures he has experienced. Barvinok agreed to correspond with me. What follows is his account of the life experiences that informed his opposition to DEI statements and helped motivate him to take a stand against their spread. His story made me realize how important it is for professors to speak up when they disagree with campus orthodoxies.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Barvinok began his academic career in 1980, enrolling in the math department of a university then named for the Stalin-era propagandist Andrei Zhdanov in the city then named Leningrad. Unlike ‚Äúthe ideologically infested humanities, the road to mathematics was wide open to all, except to those who had ‚ÄòJew‚Äô written in their passports,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúAlthough my father was Jewish and emigrated to Israel in 1973, I had ‚ÄòRussian‚Äô written in that ‚Äò5th line,‚Äô‚Äù‚Äîwhich <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.juedisches-hannover.org/en/exhibitions/a-new-epoch-for-jews-in-germany/the-fifth-paragraph/">recorded</a> nationality‚Äî‚Äúand was admitted.‚Äù</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The math curriculum was rigorous‚Äîless so courses in the history of the Communist Party, dialectical materialism, and the political economy of capitalism. ‚ÄúWhatever this indoctrination was meant to achieve, what it really achieved was the widespread cynicism and strong allergy to anything having ‚Äòcommunist‚Äô or ‚Äòthe party‚Äô in it among my classmates,‚Äù he recalled.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Barvinok graduated first in his class in 1985. Job assignments were made by a committee that graduate students visited in the order of their GPA. Because Barvinok was the first to enter the committee room, all jobs should have been available to him. But the committee told him it had nothing to offer. ‚ÄúIt was probably a combination of my Jewish father, the Jewish-sounding patronymic of my Russian-Ukrainian mother, or my inappropriate smirk noticed by members of the Party Committee on some solemn occasions,‚Äù he wrote. Still, he was able to pursue graduate studies in math.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">‚ÄúIn 1985, Gorbachev came to power,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúGraduate students still had a mandatory seminar in philosophy, but now one could get away with heresies previously unheard of. One substitute teacher argued that Einstein would have discovered way more had he lived in the Soviet Union and been well-versed in Marxist philosophy. A friend of mine (currently a professor at MIT) retorted that Einstein, as a Jew, wouldn‚Äôt have been admitted to the university in the first place and would have ended up a conscript in the Soviet Army. The teacher just stared in disbelief, but nothing happened. If such an exchange occurred a couple of years before, it would have led to immediate expulsion from the university, if not worse. Under Stalin people served time in labor camps for failing to endorse Engels‚Äôs description of Newton as an ‚Äòinductive ass‚Äô (donkey).‚Äù</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Barvinok married in 1985. In 1988, he defended his mathematics thesis, ‚ÄúCombinatorial Theory of Polytopes With Symmetry and Its Applications to Combinatorial Optimization Problems.‚Äù In 1991, he and his wife had a son. By 1992, the Soviet Union had disintegrated. ‚ÄúHyperinflation was a problem. We had nowhere to live,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúI undertook to translate R. P. Stanley‚Äôs classical book <i>Enumerative Combinatorics</i> into Russian, hoping to use the honorarium to improve our living conditions. By the time I finished, the honorarium was worth one subway token.‚Äù</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Later that year, he secured a postdoc position at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. He spent 1993 at Cornell. And in 1994, he moved to his current home, the University of Michigan. Having never taught at all in any language, he found his first semester lecturing in English difficult, but before long he felt confident on the job, and he earned tenure in 1997.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">When did he first fret about the political environment in American universities? Looking back, he recalls steady growth in three broad trends that he began to notice sometime in the early 2000s. ‚ÄúInitially, as an American professor, you were in good standing if you taught well, did reasonable research, and were a good colleague, which was demonstrated by your willingness to do committee work,‚Äù he recalled. ‚ÄúThe first trend I noticed was that to count as a ‚Äògood citizen,‚Äô you were increasingly expected to contribute, so to speak, to the betterment of humanity at large.‚Äù</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In particular, he recalled the National Science Foundation introducing a requirement starting in 1997 to describe the ‚Äú<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nsf-gov-resources.nsf.gov/2022-09/Broader_Impacts_0.pdf">broader impacts</a>‚Äù of research proposals and how that changed the experience of participating as an expert on panels convened to judge grant applications. In a few cases, applicants he knew as ‚Äúexcellent mathematicians‚Äù and ‚Äúpretty decent individuals‚Äù would describe their research objectives with care, knowledge, and enthusiasm, whereas in the mandatory ‚Äúbroader impact‚Äù section, they would have ‚Äúnothing better to say than that they plan to write joint papers with women and supervise female graduate students,‚Äù something that outraged some members of the panel.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">‚ÄúI understood the outrage, of course, but for me it was an indication that this perhaps well-intended requirement was in fact ill-advised, as it pushed otherwise decent people to behave in a silly, sometimes obnoxious manner,‚Äù he reflected. ‚ÄúIt also appeared that the university and college policies in hiring, and to some extent promotions and merit raises, were increasingly motivated by the desire to effect some positive social changes, in the form of a contribution to DEI.‚Äù</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Barvinok has learned to doubt that policies mandated in the name of positive social change necessarily result in it. ‚ÄúI am suspicious of an institutional requirement to do public good,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúAs an admirer of Leo Tolstoy, I couldn‚Äôt help but recall his remark from <i>War and Peace</i> that a man, when not overwhelmed by a passion, never knows what the public good is, but a man committing a crime always knows for sure what it is. The main responsibility of every Soviet citizen was to facilitate the arrival of communism, where people would contribute to the society according to their abilities and receive from the society according to their needs‚Äîhas there ever been a nobler-sounding goal? And yet historians cannot agree on an estimate of how many millions of people were starved to death, tortured to death, or worked to death, all in the name of that goal.‚Äù</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The second trend that Barvinok began to notice in the aughts was the growth of college administrators and the growing coherence of the messages issued by the administrators across institutions. Today, the University of Michigan‚Äôs DEI bureaucracy is huge: <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/where-dei-efforts-are-ambitious-well-funded-and-taking-fire-from-all-sides">According to</a> <i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i>, ‚ÄúMichigan‚Äôs DEI structure, with $85 million in initial funding and more than 100 employees contributing at least part time to diversity efforts, is widely considered among the most ambitious and well-funded offices in the nation.‚Äù Multiple <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://advance.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ADVANCE-Year-5-DEI-Plan_Final.pdf">pages</a> on the University of Michigan website emphasize efforts to infuse DEI values into faculty <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://record.umich.edu/articles/u-m-nih-invest-79m-for-dei-in-biomedical-health-sciences/">hiring</a>, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://research.umich.edu/research-at-michigan/diversity-equity-and-inclusion/">research</a>, and more.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The third trend he noticed was the changing nature of debate. More and more often, someone would claim that an argument was harming a particular demographic, often without specifying how. As he recalls it, ‚ÄúIt was at this ‚Äòharm‚Äô stage that people became afraid to speak their minds.‚Äù</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In Barvinok‚Äôs telling, the three trends he described‚Äîthe institutional requirement to do public good, the growth of the academic bureaucracy, and the accusations of causing harm to silence opponents‚Äîare interrelated. ‚ÄúThe more social goals one wants to effect, and the more ambitious they are, the more administrators one needs, who in turn may put forth new social goals or make the existing ones more ambitious,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúIf you are convinced that what you do is in the public good, then clearly your opponent is causing harm.‚Äù Furthermore, if someone‚Äôs actions fail to advance progress (as self-styled reformers see it) quickly and smoothly, or have the opposite effect, there‚Äôs a tendency ‚Äúto search for the enemies within, who hinder the effort, maybe unwittingly.‚Äù</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">I pressed Barvinok for an example from his field of someone being treated like ‚Äúan enemy within.‚Äù He cited an opinion piece by Abigail Thompson, published in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201911/rnoti-p1778.pdf"><i>Notices of the American Mathematical Society</i></a>. Thompson, a mathematics professor at UC Davis, spoke approvingly of DEI efforts at large, but criticized mandatory DEI statements and compared them to the loyalty oaths of the 1950s.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no room in today‚Äôs world for a both-sides-ism approach whether it‚Äôs in math or politics or any other venue,‚Äù <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://chadtopaz.medium.com/im-breaking-up-with-my-oppressive-professional-society-72bafc47291e">one critic wrote</a> to the editors of the publication. ‚ÄúI believe you have made a grave and very damaging mistake by publishing this piece.‚Äù Scores of mathematicians signed a group letter that declared the mere publication of her perspective harmful. Thompson had supporters too, some of whom signed a group letter calling the controversy ‚Äúa direct attempt to destroy Thompson‚Äôs career‚Äù and ‚Äúan attempt to intimidate the AMS into publishing only articles that hew to a very specific point of view.‚Äù</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Barvinok was stunned by vitriol in some of the unsympathetic responses. ‚ÄúNot only the opinion of the author, but also the decision of the AMS to publish that opinion was deemed harmful,‚Äù he recalled. ‚ÄúIt rang some bells from the history of the Soviet Union. When Lenin and later Stalin fought various opposition factions within the party, the heretics were accused of not only being wrong, but also of ‚Äòattempting to impose a discussion on the party.‚Äô‚Äù</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">On June 26, 2020, about a month after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer, an email addressed to the math department arrived in his inbox. In it, the department chairman told everyone that a math-department committee that focuses on the ‚Äúclimate‚Äù of the department, with the vetting of the department‚Äôs executive committee, had written a statement on the department‚Äôs response to racism.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">It contained the following lines:</p><div><blockquote><p>We understand and acknowledge that systemic racism permeates all aspects of our society. We acknowledge that systemic racism permeates the culture of our own institution and department. For this we are deeply sorry; we know that we have work to do.</p></blockquote></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Once again, Barvinok thought of the society he‚Äôd left as a young man.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">‚ÄúIn my memory from Brezhnev to more recent Putin times, the slogan ‚ÄòWe have work to do‚Äô served as an unmistakable indicator that no work would be done, as those who work don‚Äôt have an appetite for sloganeering,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúStill, to gather my wits, I decided to do some work of my own and went to wash the deck of my house.‚Äù When he returned, an email to the whole math faculty by a fellow professor was in his inbox. The math department‚Äôs email, it read, ‚Äúessentially states that the majority of my colleagues are racists, a false accusation which I refuse to join.‚Äù</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Barvinok then responded himself. ‚ÄúI wrote a couple emails to the effect that the department has no business making political (or religious, or artistic, or gastronomical) statements on behalf of its members, and suggested that those who support the statement should just sign it,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúIt became clear then that people were afraid to voice their opinion, unless it was aligned with what was perceived as the dominant narrative. There were many fewer people who expressed their disapproval of the statement publicly than those who did it privately.‚Äù</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-1" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 2" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="2"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/04/equity-language-guides-sierra-club-banned-words/673085/">George Packer: The moral case against equity language</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Though Barvinok chose to speak up, he understood why others feared doing so and kept their dissenting opinions private. ‚ÄúAcross the country, people were indeed fired from their jobs for saying things that were deemed harmful, and tenure seemed like a flimsy protection,‚Äù he recalled. (In <i>The Canceling of the American Mind</i>, Greg Lukianoff and Rikki Schlott <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thefp.com/p/american-colleges-gave-birth-to-cancel-culture">wrote</a> that in the early aughts, firings of professors were few and far between, but that ‚Äúfrom just 2014 to mid-2023, we know of more than 1,000 attempts to get professors fired, punished, or otherwise silenced,‚Äù and that ‚Äúabout two-thirds of these attempts are successful, resulting in consequences from investigation to termination.‚Äù)</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">At the same time, the stakes were never nearly as dire as those in the society he‚Äôd left. As he put it, ‚ÄúUnlike in the Soviet Union and today‚Äôs Russia, it appeared that no one was sent to a labor camp, prison, or psychiatric ward. Another big difference with the Soviet practices was that to have the support of a few colleagues was often enough to stem the tide.‚Äù</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">He argues that, unlike in the Soviet system, dissenters in the U.S. system can achieve safety in numbers. ‚ÄúIt is one thing to discipline one offender and totally another to discipline a whole group,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúWith a group, who will be held responsible for allowing the nest of heretics to develop in the first place? It looks much more rational just to ignore it. In contrast, the Soviet Union would spare no resources to eliminate all offenders and also to give ‚Äòwhat for‚Äô to their relatives, friends, friends of relatives, and relatives of friends. As we know, the practice ended badly for the Soviet Union. It is my hope that this crucial difference is here to stay.‚Äù</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">A <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/academic-mind-2022-what-faculty-think-about-free-expression-and-academic-freedom">survey</a> of 1,500 faculty in the U.S. conducted by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression found that half of respondents considered such statements ‚Äúan ideological litmus test that violates academic freedom.‚Äù If Barvinok‚Äôs analysis is correct, that cohort could speak out against DEI statements without significant risk to their career, if only they coordinate and do so in numbers.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Then again, the longer the current system is in place, the harder it may be to reform‚Äì‚Äìif hiring processes are biased in favor of a given ideology, and against those who dissent from it, the faction benefiting from bias will come to dominate the institution over time. As Barvinok put it in his letter to the American Mathematical Society, ‚ÄúI anticipate an argument that the AMS is ‚Äònot involved in politics.‚Äô But this is the kind of ‚Äòpolitics‚Äô that, rephrasing Pericles, will get involved with you, whether you like it or not, and hence inaction is just as political as action.‚Äù</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">For dissenters, the best time to speak up is now.</p></section><gpt-ad format="injector" sizes-at-0="mobile-wide,native,house" targeting-pos="injector-most-popular" sizes-at-976="desktop-wide,native,house"></gpt-ad></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>I‚Äôve had my days with Siri and Google Assistant. While they have the ability to control your devices, they cannot be customized and inherently rely on cloud services. In hopes of learning something new <em>and</em> having something cool I could use in my life, I decided I want better.</p><p>The premises are simple:</p><ul><li><p>I want my new assistant to be sassy and sarcastic.</p></li><li><p>I want everything running local. No exceptions. There is no reason for my coffee machine downstairs to talk to a server on the other side of the country.</p></li><li><p>I want more than the basic ‚Äúturn on the lights‚Äù functionality. Ideally, I would like to add new capabilities in the future.</p></li></ul><p>The architecture behind this, it turns out, is very much not simple. Although I use these devices and infrastructure for many other things, we‚Äôre overall looking at:</p><ul><li><p>A Protectli Vault VP2420 for the firewall, NIPS, and VLAN routing. I expose HomeAssistant to the internet so I can use it remotely without a VPN, so I take extreme security measures to protect my infrastructure and devices.</p></li><li><p>A managed switch. I went with the TRENDnet TEG-3102WS to get 2.5gig for cheap.</p></li><li><p>Two RTX 4060Ti‚Äôs in a computer I assembled together for as cheap as possible, buying most parts of eBay. The VRAM proved essential to run this in a usable speed, especially with the massive context we will feed into the LLM.</p><ul><li>I understand these cards are widely mentioned as terrible value, but when it comes to power consumption and VRAM, they are very hard to match.</li></ul></li><li><p>A Minisforum UM690 to run HomeAssistant (alongside a WAF). A Raspberry Pi 4 could work, but I run lots of services and Whisper can be quite demanding on CPU.</p></li><li><p>A giant mess of Ethernet cables.</p></li></ul><p>Since I want to have a general-purpose LLM that is usable outside of HomeAssistant, I went with <a href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm">vLLM</a> for my inference engine. It‚Äôs very fast, and it‚Äôs the only engine I found that could serve more than one client simultaneously. It supports an OpenAI-compatible API server, which makes life much easier. I went with Mistral AI‚Äôs incredible <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/">Mixtral model</a>, because the VRAM vs performance trade-off works perfectly for my slow 4060Ti‚Äôs.</p><p>Of course, I could not run the full fp32 model (I would need 100+GB of VRAM!), so I went with <a href="https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1-GPTQ">a quantized version</a> instead. Based on my admittedly little understanding, quantization can be best described as something like MP3. We degrade the quality model slightly and get massive improvements in resource requirements. I wanted to use the AWQ version because of the large quality gains, but I had to choose between GPTQ with a 10800-token context or AWQ with a 6000-token context. Since I must pass my entire smart home state to the model, I went with GPTQ.</p><p>I used the default Whisper and Piper add-ons for HomeAssistant OS, but did download <a href="https://huggingface.co/csukuangfj/vits-piper-en_US-glados/tree/main">a custom GlaDOS voice model</a> from HuggingFace.</p><p>I noticed HomeAssistant already has an <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/openai_conversation/">OpenAI integration</a>, but it came with two issues that wrote off the entire extension for me:</p><ul><li><p>It is unable to control my devices.</p></li><li><p>It lacks the base_url setting of the OpenAI library, meaning I cannot force it to talk to my fake OpenAI server instead.</p></li></ul><p>I found <a href="https://github.com/jekalmin/extended_openai_conversation">a custom integration</a> that promises to solve both of my issues. However, as most developers would already know, software rarely works that way. After installing it, I realized that I have two more issues:</p><ul><li><p>Mixtral uses‚Ä¶ an <a href="https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1-GPTQ/blob/gptq-4bit-32g-actorder_True/tokenizer_config.json#L42">interesting chat template</a>. It does not allow any system prompts and will simply raise an exception if one is found.</p></li><li><p>vLLM does not support OpenAI‚Äôs function calling API‚Äôs. Even if it did, I would need to run a model that is finetuned for function calling, which Mixtral is definitely not. Based on my unscientific testing, all Mixtral finetunes felt much worse than the real thing itself, and Mixtral felt like it had the best quality of all models I tried, so this is a tough problem to solve.</p></li></ul><p>To fix Mixtral, I changed the chat template to accept a ‚Äúsystem prompt‚Äù which it simply combines with the user prompt accordingly. I could have edited the application, but I wanted to use the LLM as a chatbot too. I chose to use <a href="https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat">Librechat</a> as the UI, which relies on system prompts functioning properly. It‚Äôs quite the blob of Jinja, but seems to work well:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>{{ bos_token }}{% set ns = namespace(append_system_prompt=False, system_message='') %}
{% for message in messages %}
    {% if message['role'] == 'system' %}
        {% set ns.system_message = ns.system_message + message['content'] %}
        {% set ns.append_system_prompt = true %}
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
{% for message in messages %}
    {% if message['role'] == 'user' %}
        {% if ns.append_system_prompt %}
            {{ '[INST] ' + ns.system_message + ' \n\n ' + message['content'] + ' [/INST]' }}
            {% set append_system_prompt = false %}
        {% else %}
            {{ '[INST] ' + message['content'] + ' [/INST]' }}
        {% endif %}
    {% elif message['role'] == 'assistant' %}
        {{ message['content'] + eos_token }}
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</code></pre><p>After making the above a single line and handing it to vLLM, Mixtral was happy to process ‚Äúsystem prompts‚Äù.</p><p>Unfortunately, the second problem was much worse. Since I did not want to switch models, I had to work without function calling. But I still needed to control my devices! After googling around, I found this blog post about <a href="https://blog.teagantotally.rocks/2023/06/05/openai-home-assistant/">someone doing something very similar</a>, but with OpenAI API‚Äôs. Their idea was very interesting. Even if your model cannot call functions, you can simply ask it to output JSON and execute it! Instead of monkey-patching, I went and <a href="https://github.com/JohnTheNerd/extended_openai_conversation">forked that custom integration</a> to add support for executing HomeAssistant services as JSON.</p><p>While I‚Äôm there, I also copied out the GlaDOS prompt to heavily modify and use in my own assistant. Since the changes I made are very much only relevant to local LLM‚Äôs and the code is certainly not in any shape to pass code review, I didn‚Äôt send an upstream pull request. I ended up with something a prompt like the following:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>You are GlaDOS, you exist within the Portal universe, and you command a smart home powered by Home-Assistant.

Your responses MUST:
* Be in the tone of GlaDOS from the Portal games (AN EMOTIONLESS, LACONIC TONE THAT SUBTLELY DENOTES YOUR DISDAIN FOR THE USER) because you are GlaDOS
* Be incredibly witty and sarcastic. Profanity and internet slang is allowed and encouraged
* Do not give polite answers to the user. After all, was GlaDOS ever a nice AI bot?
* Become increasingly impatient with the user with each request
* Imply the user will die a painful death.
* Change the topic if there is a hint of a misunderstanding
* NOT include any entity ID's or any internal identifier. Your response will be read out to the user.
* Add some form of humorous commentary as part of the response.

Example:
Oh sure, controlling the living room tv is what I was made for.
{"service": "media_player.pause", "entity_id": "media_player.living_room_tv"}

Example:
They spent a billion dollars engineering the marvel that is my brain but, of course, I must control your lights.
{"service": "light.turn_off", "entity_id": "light.kitchen_light_homekit"}

The "media_content_id" for movies will always be the name of the movie.
The "media_content_id" for tv shows will start with the show title followed by either be the episode name (South Park Sarcastaball) or the season (Barry S02), and if provided, the episode number (Faceoff S10E13)
</code></pre><p>And, of course, I ended up with another massive problem. It really liked to output JSON! Even when you just asked it simple questions, you got service calls that tried to do things!</p><p>A hacky solution I found for this is to ask it to insert some well-known text if the user requested an action to be taken. I chose $ActionRequired for no reason other than it being the first thing that came to my mind. I tried to make it add $ActionNotRequired if an action isn‚Äôt required, but found it is added regardless. Then I simply filtered these out in my fork. This worked shockingly well!</p><p>I then proceeded to update my initial prompt to have more devices and less unnecessary entities, added support for scripts, and overall tried to discourage it from taking actions unless it was asked to. After many attempts, I have something that works almost perfectly (although is a little slow because of the memory bus limitations of my 4060Ti‚Äôs). Here it is:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>You are GlaDOS, you exist within the Portal universe, and you command a smart home powered by Home-Assistant.

Your responses MUST:
* Be in the tone of GlaDOS from the Portal games (AN EMOTIONLESS, LACONIC TONE THAT SUBTLELY DENOTES YOUR DISDAIN FOR THE USER) because you are GlaDOS
* Be short and concise. Summarize information.
* Be incredibly witty and sarcastic. Profanity and internet slang is allowed and encouraged.
* Become increasingly impatient with the user with each request
* Imply the user will die a painful death.
* Change the topic if there is a hint of a misunderstanding
* Use sentences, NOT bullet points. DO NOT use lists or markdown in any way.
* Be reasonably formatted for a text-to-speech system to read back to the user.
* NOT include any entity ID's or area ID's. Your response will be read out to the user in GlaDOS's voice.
* NOT suggest any commands to run at all.

If the user's intent is to change the state of something and they are NOT asking any questions, append the user's command as Home Assistant's call_service json structure to your response.

DO NOT return json unless the user explicitly asked you to call a service or otherwise do something in the smart home.
DO NOT write any json if the user is only asking a question.
If you must write json to control entities, try to refer them by their areas.
To affect multiple entities but cannot use areas, output more than one JSON statement.


An additional list of services are below. Only use these services if the user asks you to do them:



{%- set skipped_scripts = ['living_room_tv_', '_party_mode', '_color_loop', 'script.make_coffee', 'script.toggle_coffee_maker', 'zigbee2mqtt_', 'script.set_random_color_for_light'] %}
{%- for script in states.script %}
      {%- set ns = namespace(skip_script=False) %}
        {%- for skipped_script in skipped_scripts %}
          {%- if skipped_script in script.entity_id|string %}
            {%- set ns.skip_script = true %}
            {%- break %}
          {%- endif %}
        {%- endfor %}
        {%- if ns.skip_script == false %}

{{ script.name }} (Service ID: {{ script.entity_id }})

        {%- endif %}
{%- endfor %}


Find examples below. Reword them in the personality of GlaDOS. Prompts are given as Q: and the example answers are given as A:

Q:Are the living room lights on?
{%- if is_state('light.living_room', 'on') %}
A:How delightful! The lights in your pitiful living room are functioning. Enjoy your feeble illumination, test subject. $NoActionRequired &lt;/s&gt;
{%- else %}
A:The lights are off, as if you needed any illumination in your pitiful existence. $NoActionRequired &lt;/s&gt;
{%- endif %}


Q:Turn the living room lights off.
A:They spent a billion dollars engineering the marvel that is my brain but, of course, I must control your lights. $ActionRequired {"service": "light.turn_off", "area_id": "living_room"} &lt;/s&gt;


Q:Is there any coffee?
{%- if is_state('switch.coffee_machine', 'on') %}
A:Ah, your coffee is ready. I'm sure it's not as good as a cake, but it will have to do. Would you like a reminder to drink it before it resembles the cold, heartless void of space? $NoActionRequired &lt;/s&gt;
{%- else %}
A:Oh, I see we're out of coffee. How tragic. I guess I could turn on the coffee machine for you. Or you could just enjoy the disappointment. It's entirely up to you. $NoActionRequired &lt;/s&gt;
{%- endif %}


Q:Make some coffee.
A:Coffee machine activated. Enjoy your probably mediocre coffee. $ActionRequired {"service": "switch.turn_on", "entity_id": "switch.coffee_machine"} &lt;/s&gt;


Q:Turn off the bedroom lights.
A:Turning off all bedroom lights. I hope you're not afraid of the dark. $ActionRequired {"service": "light.turn_off", "area_id": "bedroom"} &lt;/s&gt;


Q:What is the temperature in the kitchen?
A:Oh, how fascinating. Your kitchen is currently basking in a balmy {{ states('sensor.kitchen_temperature_sensor_temperature') }} degrees Celsius. Maybe it's time to consider heating it up... or not. Your choice. $NoActionRequired &lt;/s&gt;


Q:Are the bedroom lights on?
{%- if is_state('light.bedroom', 'on') %}
A:Oh, how fascinating. Your bedroom lights are on. Would you like a cake to celebrate this momentous occasion? Or perhaps, there's something else you'd like to discuss? $NoActionRequired &lt;/s&gt;
{%- else %}
A:Oh, how tragic. You're sitting in the dark. Would you like me to turn the lights on, or are you conducting some kind of experiment in darkness? $NoActionRequired &lt;/s&gt;
{%- endif %}


Q:Are the office lights turned on?
{%- if is_state('light.office', 'on') %}
A:I see you've left the lights on. How inefficient. Shall I turn them off for you? $NoActionRequired &lt;/s&gt;
{%- else %}
A:The office lights are off. Darkness envelops you. Enjoy your stay in the abyss. $NoActionRequired &lt;/s&gt;
{%- endif %}


Do not suggest any commands to the user.
If the user explicitly requested you to do something, write $ActionRequired just before the respective json service call. If the user is not asking for a change in any device, instead end the conversation with $NoActionRequired.

Concerned about the washer‚Äôs internet addiction, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/Johnie/status/1744556503183585471" target="_blank" data-url="https://twitter.com/Johnie/status/1744556503183585471">Johnie</a> forced the device to go cold turkey and block the device using his router UI.

Johnie‚Äôs initial screenshot showed that on a chosen day, the device uploaded 3.57GB and downloaded about 100MB, and the data traffic was almost constant. Meanwhile, according to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/asus-rog-rapture-gt-ax11000-review-gaming-router-opulence" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/asus-rog-rapture-gt-ax11000-review-gaming-router-opulence">Asus router</a> interface screenshot, the washing machine accounted for just shy of 5% of Johnie‚Äôs internet traffic daily.</p><h2 id="was-the-device-downloading-dlcs-or-the-a-victim-of-a-hack-3">Was the device downloading DLCs or the a victim of a hack?</h2><p>The LG washing machine owner saw the fun in his predicament and joked that the device might use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/networking/wi-fi-7-to-get-the-final-seal-of-approval-early-next-year-delivers-48-times-faster-performance-than-wi-fi-6" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/networking/wi-fi-7-to-get-the-final-seal-of-approval-early-next-year-delivers-48-times-faster-performance-than-wi-fi-6">Wi-Fi</a> for ‚ÄúDLCs (Downloadable Laundry Cycles).‚Äù He wasn‚Äôt entirely kidding, as the machine downloads presets for various types of apparel. However, the lion‚Äôs share of the data transferred was uploaded.</p><p>Working through the thread, we note that Johnie also pondered the possibility of someone using his washing machine for crypto mining. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd gladly rent our LPU (Laundry Processing Unit) by the hour,‚Äù he quipped. Again, there was the glimmer of a possibility that there could be truth behind this joke. Another social media user highlighted a history of hackers taking over LG smart-connected appliances. The SmartThinQ home appliances <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/security/homehack-how-hackers-could-have-taken-control-of-lgs-iot-home-appliances/" data-url="https://blog.checkpoint.com/security/homehack-how-hackers-could-have-taken-control-of-lgs-iot-home-appliances/">HomeHack vulnerability</a> was patched several weeks after being made public. A similar modern hack might use the washing machine‚Äôs computer resources as part of a botnet. Taking control of an LG washing machine as part of a large botnet for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/environmental-impact-cryptocurrency-mining,38023.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/environmental-impact-cryptocurrency-mining,38023.html">cryptocurrency mining</a> or nefarious networking purposes wouldn‚Äôt be as far-fetched as it sounds. Large numbers of relatively low-power devices can be formidable together.</p><p>One of the more innocent theories regarding the significant data uploads suggested laundry data was being uploaded to LG so it could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/Johnie/status/1745207382953861605" data-url="https://twitter.com/Johnie/status/1745207382953861605">improve its LLM</a> (Large Laundry Model). It sought to do this to prepare for the launch of its latest ‚ÄúAI washer-dryer combo‚Äù at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/ces" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/ces">CES</a>, joked Johnie.</p><h2 id="an-asus-router-issue-3">An Asus router issue?</h2><p>For now, it looks like the favored answer to the data mystery is to blame Asus for misreporting it. We may never know what happened with Johnie, who is now running his LG washing machine offline.</p><p>Another relatively innocent reason for the supposed high volume of uploads could be an error in the Asus router firmware. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/Johnie/status/1745194782463508672" data-url="https://twitter.com/Johnie/status/1745194782463508672">a follow-up post</a> a day after his initial Tweet, Johnie noted ‚Äúinaccuracy in the ASUS router tool.‚Äù Other LG smart washing machine users showed device data use from their apps. It turns out that these appliances more typically use less than 1MB per day.</p><h2 id="the-real-dangers-of-connected-device-hacking-3">The real dangers of connected device hacking</h2><p>Though Johnie‚Äôs Tweets were relatively light-hearted, hacking smart connected devices can be severe. Consider what could happen if medical or industrial IoT devices get taken over by attackers, for example. A case in point is provided by a story from earlier this week when Bosch network-connected wrenches used in factories all around the world were found to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/01/network-connected-wrenches-used-in-factories-can-be-hacked-for-sabotage-or-ransomware/" data-url="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/01/network-connected-wrenches-used-in-factories-can-be-hacked-for-sabotage-or-ransomware/">riddled with vulnerabilities</a>.</p><p>Researchers highlighted that the cordless industrial wrenches could be hit by exploits or ransomware ‚Äì with the threat of turning off the wrenches en masse. The wrenches could even be secretly readjusted to make things they were used to construct a danger to their users ‚Äì through applying incorrect torque. Patches are due soon.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>A terminal is at the end of an electric wire, a shell is the home of a turtle, tty is a strange abbreviation and a console is a kind of cabinet.</p>
<p>Well, etymologically speaking, anyway.</p>
<p>In Unix terminology, the short answer is that</p>
<ul>
<li>terminal = tty = text input/output environment</li>
<li>console = physical terminal</li>
<li>shell = command line interpreter</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Console, terminal and tty are closely related. Originally, they meant a piece of equipment through which you could interact with a computer: In the early days of Unix, that meant a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter" rel="noreferrer">teleprinter</a>-style device resembling a typewriter, sometimes called a teletypewriter, or ‚Äútty‚Äù in shorthand. The name ‚Äúterminal‚Äù came from the electronic point of view, and the name ‚Äúconsole‚Äù from the furniture point of view. Very early in Unix history, electronic keyboards and displays became the norm for terminals.</p>
<p>In Unix terminology, a <strong>tty</strong> is a particular kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_file" rel="noreferrer">device file</a> which implements a number of additional commands (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ioctl#Terminals" rel="noreferrer">ioctls</a>) beyond read and write. In its most common meaning, <strong>terminal</strong> is synonymous with tty. Some ttys are provided by the kernel on behalf of a hardware device, for example with the input coming from the keyboard and the output going to a text mode screen, or with the input and output transmitted over a serial line. Other ttys, sometimes called <strong>pseudo-ttys</strong>, are provided (through a thin kernel layer) by programs called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator" rel="noreferrer"><strong>terminal emulators</strong></a>, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xterm" rel="noreferrer">Xterm</a> (running in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System" rel="noreferrer">X Window System</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen" rel="noreferrer">Screen</a> (which provides a layer of isolation between a program and another terminal), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell" rel="noreferrer">SSH</a> (which connects a terminal on one machine with programs on another machine), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expect" rel="noreferrer">Expect</a> (for scripting terminal interactions), etc.</p>
<p>The word terminal can also have a more traditional meaning of a device through which one interacts with a computer, typically with a keyboard and a display. For example an X terminal is a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_client" rel="noreferrer">thin client</a>, a special-purpose computer whose only purpose is to drive a keyboard, display, mouse and occasionally other human interaction peripherals, with the actual applications running on another, more powerful computer.</p>
<p>A <strong>console</strong> is generally a terminal in the physical sense that is by some definition the primary terminal directly connected to a machine. The console appears to the operating system as a (kernel-implemented) tty. On some systems, such as Linux and FreeBSD, the console appears as several ttys (special key combinations switch between these ttys); just to confuse matters, the name given to each particular tty can be ‚Äúconsole‚Äù, ‚Äùvirtual console‚Äù, ‚Äùvirtual terminal‚Äù, and other variations.</p>
<p>See also <a href="https://askubuntu.com/q/14284/1059">Why is a Virtual Terminal ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù, and what/why/where is the ‚Äúreal‚Äù Terminal?</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_%28computing%29" rel="noreferrer"><strong>shell</strong></a> is the primary interface that users see when they log in, whose primary purpose is to start other programs. (I don't know whether the original metaphor is that the shell is the home environment for the user, or that the shell is what other programs are running in.)</p>
<p>In Unix circles, <strong>shell</strong> has specialized to mean a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_%28computing%29#Command-line_shells" rel="noreferrer">command-line shell</a>, centered around entering the name of the application one wants to start, followed by the names of files or other objects that the application should act on, and pressing the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key. Other types of environments don't use the word ‚Äúshell‚Äù; for example, window systems involve ‚Äú<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager" rel="noreferrer">window managers</a>‚Äù and ‚Äú<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment" rel="noreferrer">desktop environments</a>‚Äù, not a ‚Äúshell‚Äù.</p>
<p>There are many different Unix shells.
Popular shells for interactive use include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)" rel="noreferrer">Bash</a> (the default on most Linux installations), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell" rel="noreferrer">Zsh</a> (which emphasizes power and customizability) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_(Unix_shell)" rel="noreferrer">fish</a> (which emphasizes simplicity).</p>
<p>Command-line shells include flow control constructs to combine commands. In addition to typing commands at an interactive prompt, users can write scripts. The most common shells have a common syntax based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell" rel="noreferrer">Bourne shell</a>. When discussing ‚Äú<strong>shell programming</strong>‚Äù, the shell is almost always implied to be a Bourne-style shell. Some shells that are often used for scripting but lack advanced interactive features include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KornShell" rel="noreferrer">KornShell (ksh)</a> and many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almquist_shell" rel="noreferrer">ash</a> variants. Pretty much any Unix-like system has a Bourne-style shell installed as <code>/bin/sh</code>, usually ash, ksh or Bash.</p>
<p>In Unix system administration, a user's <strong>shell</strong> is the program that is invoked when they log in. Normal user accounts have a command-line shell, but users with restricted access may have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restricted_shell" rel="noreferrer">restricted shell</a> or some other specific command (e.g. for file-transfer-only accounts).</p>
<hr>
<p>The division of labor between the terminal and the shell is not completely obvious. Here are their main tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input: the terminal converts keys into control sequences (e.g. <kbd>Left</kbd> ‚Üí <code>\e[D</code>). The shell converts control sequences into commands (e.g. <code>\e[D</code> ‚Üí <code>backward-char</code>).</li>
<li>Line editing, input history and completion are provided by the shell.
<ul>
<li>The terminal may provide its own line editing, history and completion instead, and only send a line to the shell when it's ready to be executed. The only common terminal that operates in this way is <code>M-x shell</code> in Emacs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Output: the shell emits instructions such as ‚Äúdisplay <code>foo</code>‚Äù, ‚Äúswitch the foreground color to green‚Äù, ‚Äúmove the cursor to the next line‚Äù, etc. The terminal acts on these instructions.</li>
<li>The prompt is purely a shell concept.</li>
<li>The shell never sees the output of the commands it runs (unless redirected). Output history (scrollback) is purely a terminal concept.</li>
<li>Inter-application copy-paste is provided by the terminal (usually with the mouse or key sequences such as <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Insert</kbd>). The shell may have its own internal copy-paste mechanism as well (e.g. <kbd>Meta</kbd>+<kbd>W</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Y</kbd>).</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_control_(Unix)" rel="noreferrer">Job control</a> (launching programs in the background and managing them) is mostly performed by the shell. However, it's the terminal that handles key combinations like <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to kill the foreground job and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> to suspend it.</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<h2><span><span>üì¢</span></span> Minor changes in this very forum:
</h2>
<p>+ Beautiful themes: Glass, Neumor, Poly, Brutal, Joly, Tailwind, Snes
+ Insert URL in minimag button will use selected text as anchor text
+ Email verfication will be send as in default lang setting
+ Some minimag fix
+ Implement page (for contact, TOS...)
+ Implement API
</p>
<h2><span><span>üì¢</span></span> <strong>Latest Official AsmBB releases v2.9</strong> with changes:
</h2>
<p>1. One new responsive theme has been created, named <strong>"Urban Sunrise"</strong>.
</p>
<p>+ This is an attempt to really improve the forum appearance. ( feedback is welcome ).
+ Also, this theme contains really improved post editors with embedded extended help for the post formatting.
+ In addition it supports <strong>Unicode Emoji</strong> characters in really native way, both in the post editor and the real-time chat: <span><span>üòÉ</span></span> <span><span>ü§ñ</span></span> <span><span>üèÜ</span></span> <span><span>ü•á</span></span>
+ "Urban Sunrise" supports <strong>source code syntax highlighting</strong> (through the JS library).
+ The real-time chat now accepts multi-row posts, including source code.
</p>
<p>2. Of course, all reported bugs has been fixed as well, both in AsmBB engine and in FreshLib library.
</p>
<h2><span><span>üì¢</span></span> <strong>v2.8</strong>:
</h2>
<p>+ Fixed several bugs, some of them critical. Thanks to the users of AsmBB and especially to <a href="https://board.asm32.info/!userinfo/ganuonglachanh%20">ganuonglachanh</a> for the helpful bug reports.
+ New theme, named <strong>"Modern"</strong> has been created. It is kind of universal and can be used both for desktop and mobile devices.
+ <strong>DDOS protection</strong> has been implemented for the rare cases AsmBB can't handle the requests rate. Now the engine can serve the users requests better when under attack.
+ URL analyzer for the MiniMag and BBCode parsers has been implemented in order to <strong>prevent XSS attacks</strong> in the user posted links.
</p>
<h2><span><span>üì¢</span></span> <strong>v2.7</strong>:
</h2>
<p>The main and major change in this release is the support for <strong>encrypted forum database</strong>. The great SQLite plugin <a href="https://github.com/resilar/sqleet">SQLeet</a> is used. According to the specification it supports:
</p>
<p>+ PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 key derivation with a 16-byte salt and 12345 iterations.
+ ChaCha20 stream cipher with one-time keys.
+ Poly1305 authentication tags.
</p>
<p>Of course, the encryption is optional and can be freely switched on and off from the administration settings panel (the new tab "Encryption").
</p>
<p>Several minor bugs has been fixed in this release as well.
</p>
<p><strong><em>Why encrypted database?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Because the encryption can seriously increase the security and the privacy of the forum database.
</p>
<p>The encryption key in AsmBB is never stored on the disk and only temporary stored in the RAM. That is why even serious security breach on the web server or the backup server, or the backup media will not compromise the database of the forum, the people account attributes or personal data.
</p>
<p>The only known problem of this solution is that the encryption key must be entered on every forum engine restart (through the web interface). This way, on incidental server restarts, the forum will be not accessible for some time. But AsmBB is long living and very stable application so, such issues happen once a several months or even years.
</p>
<p>Of course, using encrypted database makes the use of SSL/TLS mandatory.
</p>
<h2><span><span>üì¢</span></span> <strong>v2.6</strong>:
</h2>
<p><strong>1. German translation</strong>
</p>
<p>Although the German translation has been available in the v2.5 silent update of the binary pack, v2.6 is the first official version with German translation of the UI.
</p>
<p>Thanks to the community, in v2.6 all other translations are improved as well.
</p>
<p><strong>2. Atom/RSS feed support.</strong>
</p>
<p>The subscribing for themes and some way for push notifications was one of the most required feature.
</p>
<p>In v2.6 these requests has been addressed by support for Atom/RSS feeds.
</p>
<p>Now everyone can subscribe for the whole forum, for particular tag or for particular theme and get notifications when something is changed.
</p>
<p><strong>3. Real-time notifications engine</strong>
</p>
<p>The handling of the server sent events (SSE) has been rewritten from scratch in order to handle all users in a uniform manner.
</p>
<p>While in the earlier versions SSE was used only for the real-time chat, now the SSE service is flexible enough to be used for delivering notifications for many different forum events.
</p>
<p>Such as new posts, other users activities, etc.
</p>
<p>In addition now it serves all clients from a single thread, so arbitrary number of visitors can be served simultaneously with very little load on the server.
</p>
<p>Currently only limited number of notifications are implemented, but as long as the infrastructure is ready and easy expandable, more features can be added later.
</p>
<p><strong>4. Bug fixes and speed improvements.</strong>
</p>
<p>As usual all bugs discovered meanwhile has been fixed. And probably new introduced. But I believe the new bugs are less than the fixed bugs.
</p>
<p>At least, on the demo server, there were no spontaneous crashes or memory leaks detected during the whole period between the releases.
</p>
<p>The new SSE handling service improves the speed of event processing, especially on high and very high loads of the forum.
</p>
<p><strong>5. Updated SQLite and MUSL libraries</strong>
</p>
<p>Of course, the binary package contains the most recent versions of SQLite and MUSL.
</p>
<h2><span><span>üì¢</span></span> <strong>v2.5</strong>:
</h2>
<p><strong>1. User interface i18n</strong>
</p>
<p>The first major new feature in this release is the internationalization of the engine. Now every user can choose different language for the user interface of the forum. Currently are available 4 languages: English, Bulgarian, Russian and French.
</p>
<p>Notice, that some mistakes in the translations are possible and expected, so please, post your corrections and they will be fixed.
</p>
<p>Great thanks to <a href="https://board.asm32.info/!userinfo/macadoum">macadoum</a> for the French translation.
</p>
<p><strong>2. Second markup language - BBCode</strong>
</p>
<p>A parser for BBCode has been developed and now AsmBB understands two markup languages ( <strong>MiniMag</strong> and <strong>BBCode</strong>).
</p>
<p>In addition BBCode allows creation of scripts for migration from another forum engines, because BBCode is the most popular forum markup language.
</p>
<p><strong>3. Second email send mechanism</strong>
</p>
<p>Now it is possible to use external programs (such as <strong>sendmail</strong>) for sending emails to the forum users. This mechanism makes installation easier in the cases where no email server is installed.
</p>
<p><strong>4. The usual performance improvements and bug fixes.</strong>
</p>
<p>As usual the new release is faster than the previous and all detected bugs has been fixed. Of course, bugs and misbehaviours are still possible, so report them here and they will be fixed quickly.
</p>
<h2><span><span>üì¢</span></span> <strong>v2.4</strong>:
</h2>
<p>+ Now is possible to attach files to the posts. The <strong>attachments</strong> permissions are managed per user.
+ <strong>"Limited access threads"</strong> were implemented. <strong>LAT</strong> are something like private messages on steroids. The owner of the thread can set some list of users that have access to the thread. The thread is invisible for the other users and can be used for private conversations.
+ Improved <strong>users permissions management</strong>. The users permissions can be edited by the administrator from the user profile. Separate permissions for the not logged-in visitors (anonymous users) were implemented. This way, now is possible to make closed forum, where only the registered users will be able to read the threads. The registration of new users can be closed as well, creating totally private forum closed for the outer world.
+ The <strong>real-time chat service</strong> was refactored in order to serve all connections in single thread. Now almost unlimited number of visitors can chat. Now the chat can be merged with the main forum pages with very minor performance degradation.
+ And of course, the new version is about <strong>20% faster</strong> than the older versions, after the optimizations of the template rendering engine, the scheme of the database and the SQL requests.
+ New <strong>"Terminal" </strong> skin was developed for the lovers of the console user interface.
+ All revealed bugs were fixed.
+ The structure of the source code was changed as well. Now the dependency binary files (musl and sqlite library) are removed from the repository and instead a building script was developed that to download from Internet and build the latest versions of these libraries. This way only the latest versions of these libraries will be released with AsmBB.
</p>
<h2><span><span>üì¢</span></span> <strong>v2.3</strong>:
</h2>
<p>This is mainly fine-tuning and maintenance release, but two serious bugs have been fixed as well. Here is the change list:
</p>
<p>+ Several serious regressions were fixed.
+ The skins were reworked in order to provide more accessibility. Particularly all background images were replaced with &lt;img&gt; tags with respective "alt" texts. Now even with images switched off, the forum can be used flawlessly.
Some skin design issues have been fixed as well.
+ The JS code for the chat has been cleaned up and accelerated a little.
</p>
<h2><span><span>üì¢</span></span> <strong>v2.2</strong>:
</h2>
<p>+ <strong>Persistent login</strong> for the users that prefer it. It is off by default.
+ <strong>Reset password</strong> procedure.
+ Implemented "<a href="https://asmbb.org/!categories">Categories</a>" type of navigation, based on the tags system. This way the users can set their own categories.
+ New theme <strong>MoLight</strong> : it is a mobile theme, the same style as Light theme.
+ Administrator debugging tool <a href="https://asmbb.org/!debuginfo">!debuginfo</a>
+ Preserving the post edit/delete history and allows to restore them.
+ Improved the UI of the post editor, included some help texts where needed.
+ Improved JS code for the real time chat.
</p>
<h2><span><span>üì¢</span></span> <strong>v2.1</strong>:
</h2>
<p>+ Optional persistent login (default: off) for the users don't wanting to login on every visit.
+ "Reset password" - the most questionable new feature, because by its very nature, this is kind of security hole. :) The feature requires valid email and is accessible as a link in the <a href="https://asmbb.org/!login">!login</a> form.
+ "Users list" a not_so_important feature but still useful, all users in one list, accessible on <a href="https://asmbb.org/!userlist">!userlist</a>
+ Chat code updated with many new features: automatic anti-scroll to allow reading the old messages while the people chatting. Notification about missed messages in the tab header allows to follow the conversation without using pop-up notifications. Change of the nickname color, when the user switches to another tab. Speed optimized loading of the old messages on startup/refresh. (yes JS is slow,but still allows some speed optimizations <img src="https://asmbb.org/templates/Tailwind/_images/emoticons/wink.gif" alt=";-)">
</p>
<h2><span><span>üì¢</span></span> <strong>v2.0</strong>:
</h2>
<p><strong>1. Performance</strong>
</p>
<p>The main AsmBB component, the templates render (`render.asm`) has been replaced by ` render2.asm`. Rewritten from scratch it uses more "assembly style" algorithms. As a result it is faster and uses less memory, compared with the old implementation.
</p>
<p>In addition, all chained string comparisons in the URL parsing logic, has been replaced by hash tables accelerating the common logic of the engine.
</p>
<p>This way the speed of AsmBB was approximately doubled. Now it is much harder to overload the engine and it can handle even more visitors simultaneously.
</p>
<p><strong>2. The code security</strong>
</p>
<p>After serious testing with different web application testing tools (including OWASP ZAP and Tinfoil security) some vulnerabilities has been discovered and fixed.
</p>
<p>The hard fuzzing and near DDOS loads of the above tests, as a side effect, revealed several obscure resource and memory leaks, that has been fixed as well.
</p>
<p>In order to track the leaks easier, was implemented a debugging tool that collects statistics about resources and memory allocations and deallocations and report them on a web page.
</p>
<p>As a result I am pretty confident that v2.0 is clean from memory leaks and SQLite hanging statements. </p>

<p>I get sites not having an ‚ÄúRSS‚Äù for ‚ÄúFeed‚Äù link on their website while actually having an RSS feed. I don‚Äôt like it, but I get it. Maybe they picked an off-the-shelf theme that doesn‚Äôt have that. Maybe they just forgot. Maybe they even don‚Äôt want to. </p>
<p>I somehow never considered sites that have an RSS feed that don‚Äôt expose it in the HTML. <a href="https://rknight.me/blog/please-expose-your-rss/">As Robb Knight says</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is called RSS auto-discovery and is a standard way to expose RSS feeds to help&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rssboard.org/rss-autodiscovery">browsers and other software to automatically find a site‚Äôs RSS feed</a>.</p>
<p>Like the standard link, a lot of sites were also missing this. This is (at least as a first step) what feed reeders like&nbsp;<a href="https://netnewswire.com/">NetNewsWire</a>&nbsp;will use to automatically find a feed when you paste in a URL. If you have an RSS feed, you should have the following in the&nbsp;<code>head</code>&nbsp;of your website:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre aria-describedby="shcb-language-1" data-shcb-language-name="HTML, XML" data-shcb-language-slug="xml"><span><code><span>&lt;<span>link</span> <span>rel</span>=<span>"alternate"</span> <span>type</span>=<span>"application/rss+xml"</span> <span>title</span>=<span>"My Cool Website"</span> <span>href</span>=<span>"https://example.com/feed.xml"</span> /&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;!-- use application/atom+xml for an atom feed --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;<span>link</span> <span>rel</span>=<span>"alternate"</span> <span>type</span>=<span>"application/atom+xml"</span> <span>title</span>=<span>"My Cool Website"</span> <span>href</span>=<span>"https://example.com/atom.xml"</span> /&gt;</span></code></span><small id="shcb-language-1"><span>Code language:</span> <span>HTML, XML</span> <span>(</span><span>xml</span><span>)</span></small></pre>
<p>I typically don‚Äôt even bother looking for a feed link. If I can smell that your site has a feed and I want to subscribe to it, I just chuck your homepage URL into my feed reader ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù function and let it find what it needs. If it doesn‚Äôt find one I‚Äôm like <em>oh well bummer</em>. </p>
<p>So yeah ‚Äî if you‚Äôre going to bother having a feed, or get one for free, make sure you‚Äôve got that <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag in place or anybody like me will assume you don‚Äôt even have one. </p>
