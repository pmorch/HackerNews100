<h3 id="spaced-repetition-recap">Spaced repetition recap</h3>
<p>Mastering any subject is built on a foundation of knowledge: knowledge of facts, of heuristics, or of problem-solving tactics. If a subject is part of your full-time job, then you’ll likely master it through repeated exposure to this knowledge. But for something you’re working on part-time—like myself <a href="https://domenic.me/part-time-japanese">learning Japanese</a>—it’s very difficult to get that level of practice.</p>
<p>The same goes for subjects in school: a few hours of class or homework a week is rarely enough to build up an enduring knowledge base, especially in fact-heavy subjects like history or medicine. Even parts of your life that you might not think of as learning-related can be seen through this lens: wouldn’t all those podcasts and Hacker News articles feel more worthwhile, if you retained the information you gathered from them indefinitely?</p>
<p>Spaced repetition systems are one of the most-developed answers to this problem. They’re software programs which essentially display flashcards, with the prompt on the front of the card asking you to recall the information on the back of the card. You can read more about them <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Spaced_repetition_memory_system">in Andy’s notes</a>, or get a flavor from the images below drawn from my personal collection:</p>

</figure>
<p>What gives these programs their name is how they space out repeatedly prompting you to review the same card, depending on how you self-grade your response. Increasing intervals after correct answers prevents daily reviews from piling up. This is how you can, for example, learn 10 new second-language words a day (3,650 per year!) with only 20 minutes of daily review time.</p>
<p>(If you’re still unconvinced and have some time to spare, I suggest Michael Nielsen’s post <a href="https://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">Augmenting Long-term Memory</a>.)</p>
<h3 id="improving-the-scheduling-algorithm">Improving the scheduling algorithm</h3>
<p>So far, this is all well-known. But what’s less widely known is that a quiet revolution has greatly improved spaced repetition systems over the last couple of years, making them significantly more efficient and less frustrating to use. The magic ingredient is a new scheduling algorithm known as <a href="https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/ABC-of-FSRS">FSRS</a>, by <a href="https://l-m-sherlock.github.io/">Jarrett Ye</a>.</p>
<p>To understand how these systems have improved, first let’s consider how they used to work. Roughly speaking, you’d get shown a card one day after creating it. If you got it right, you’d get shown it again after 6 days. If you get it right a second time, it’d be next scheduled for 15 days later. If you get the card right three times in a row, then it’s 37.5 days later. In general, after the 6-day interval, there’s an exponential backoff, defaulting to 6&nbsp;×&nbsp;2.5<sup>times&nbsp;correct&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</sup>. You can see how, if you keep getting the card right, this can lead to a large knowledge base, with only a small number of reviews per day!</p>
<p>But what if you get it wrong? Then, you’d reset back to day 1! You’d see the card again the next day, then 6 days after that, and so on. (Although missing the card can also adjust its “ease factor”, i.e. the base in the exponential that is by default set to 2.5.) This can be a fairly frustrating experience, as you experience a card ping-ponging between long and short intervals.</p>
<p>If we step back, we realize that this scheduling system (called “SuperMemo-2”) is pretty arbitrary. Where does the rule of 1, 6, 2.5<sup>times&nbsp;correct&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</sup>, reset back on failure come from? It turns out it was <a href="https://super-memory.com/english/ol/sm2.htm">developed by a college student in 1987</a> based on his personal experiments. Can’t we do better?</p>
<p>Recall <a href="https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/Spaced-Repetition-Algorithm:-A-Three%E2%80%90Day-Journey-from-Novice-to-Expert#spaced-repetition">the theory behind spaced repetition</a>: we’re trying to beat the “forgetting curve”, by testing ourselves on the material “just before we were about to forget it”. It seems pretty unlikely that the forgetting curve for every single piece of knowledge is the same: that no matter what I’m learning, I’ll be just about to forget it after 1 day, then 6 more days, then 15, etc. And sure, we can throw in some modifications to the ease factor, but it’s still pretty unlikely that the ideal review schedule is a perfect exponential, even if you let the base vary a bit in response to feedback.</p>
<figure>

  <figcaption>One of many illustrations of the forgetting curve. This one seems to have originated in <a href="https://www.osmosis.org/learn/Spaced_repetition">a lecture on osmosis.org</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The insight of the FSRS algorithm is to concretize our goal (testing “just before we are about to forget”) as a prediction problem: <em>when does the probability of recalling a card drop to 90%?</em>. And this sort of prediction problem is something that machine learning systems excel at.</p>
<h3 id="some-neat-facts-about-how-fsrs-works">Some neat facts about how FSRS works</h3>
<p>The above insight—let’s apply machine learning to find the right intervals, instead of using an arbitrary formula—is the core of FSRS. You don’t really need to know how it works to benefit from it. But here’s a brief explanation of some of the details, since I think they’re cool.</p>
<p>FSRS calls itself a “three-component” model because it uses machine learning to fit curves for three main functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Difficulty, a per-card number between 1 and 10 roughly representing how difficult the card is</li>
<li>Stability, which is how long a card takes to fall from 100% probability of recall to 90% probability of recall</li>
<li>Retrievability, which is the probability of recall after a given number of days</li>
</ul>
<p>For each card, it computes values for these based on <a href="https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/The-Algorithm">various formulas</a>. For example, the retrievability curve has been <a href="https://expertium.github.io/Algorithm.html#r-retrievability">tweaked over time</a> from an exponential to a power function, to better fit observed data.</p>
<p>The curve-fitting is done using 21 parameters. These parameters start with values derived to fit the curves from tens of thousands of reviews people have previously done. But the best results are found when you run the FSRS optimizer over your own set of reviews, which will adjust the parameters to fit your personal difficulty/stability/retrievability functions. (This parameter adjustment is where the machine learning comes in: the parameter values <a href="https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/The-mechanism-of-optimization">are found</a> using techniques you may have heard of, like maximum likelihood estimation and stochastic gradient descent.)</p>
<p>Although the core FSRS algorithm concerns itself with predicting these three functions, as a user what you care about is card scheduling. For that, FSRS lets you pick a desired retention rate, with a default of 90%, and then uses those three functions to calculate the next time you’ll see a card, after you review it and grade yourself.</p>
<p>But if you want, you can change this desired retention rate. And because FSRS has detailed models of how you retain information, with its difficulty/stability/retrievability functions, it can simulate what your workload will be for any given rate. The maintainers <a href="https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/fsrs4anki/wiki/The-Optimal-Retention">suggest</a> that you set the desired retention to minimize your workload-to-knowledge ratio.</p>
<p>This can have fairly dramatic effects: below we see two simulations for my personal Japanese vocab deck, with the orange line being the default 90% desired retention, and the blue line being the 70% desired retention which FSRS has suggested I use to minimize the workload-to-knowledge ratio. The simulation runs for 365 days, adding 10 new cards per day as long as I have less than 200 reviews. As you can see, the 70% desired retention settings have dramatically fewer reviews per day, in less time, while ending with many more cards memorized (because it doesn’t hit the 200 card limit that caps new cards).</p>

  <img src="https://domenic.me/images/fsrs-simulation-time.webp" width="751" height="367" alt="A graph with the orange line (90% target retention) oscillating around 24 minutes, whereas the blue line (70% target retention) slowly trends up from around 13 minutes at the start to 23 minutes by the end.">

  <figcaption>Number of cards memorized</figcaption></figure>

<p>(Note that the 90% number used when calculating the stability function is not the same as desired retention. It’s just used to predict the shape of the forgetting curve. The <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3534678.3539081">original paper</a> used half-life, i.e. how long until the card reaches 50% probability of recall, since that’s more academic.)</p>
<h3 id="fsrs-in-practice">FSRS in practice</h3>
<p>If you want to use FSRS, instead of other <a href="https://github.com/open-spaced-repetition/srs-benchmark/blob/main/README.md#superiority">outperformed</a> algorithms, you have to use software that supports it. Thankfully, the leading spaced repetition software, <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a>, has incorporated FSRS as its default scheduling algorithm since version 23.10, released in 2023-11. You might already be using it!</p>
<p>(The <a href="https://l-m-sherlock.notion.site/The-History-of-FSRS-for-Anki-1e6c250163a180a4bfd7fb1fee2a3043">story</a> of how it got into Anki, by the way, is pretty cool. The creator of FSRS, <a href="https://medium.com/@JarrettYe/how-did-i-publish-a-paper-in-acmkdd-as-an-undergraduate-c0199baddf31">an undergrad at the time</a>, posted on the Anki subreddit about his new algorithm. A commenter challenged him to go implement his algorithm in software, instead of just publishing a paper. He first implemented it as an Anki add-on, and its growing popularity eventually convinced the Anki developers to bring it into the core code!)</p>
<p>Subjectively, I’ve found FSRS to be a huge upgrade to my quality of reviews over the previous, SuperMemo-2–derived Anki algorithm. The review load is much lighter. The feeling of despair when missing a card is significantly minimized, since doing so no longer resets you back to day 1. And the better statistical modeling FSRS provides gives me much more confidence that the cards Anki counts me as having learned, are actually sticking in my brain.</p>
<p>For Japanese language learning specifically, the advantages of FSRS are even stronger when you compare them to the “algorithms” used by two popular subscription services. <a href="https://www.wanikani.com/">WaniKani</a>, a kanji/vocab-learning site, and <a href="https://bunpro.jp/">Bunpro</a>, a grammar-learning site, use <em>extremely</em> unfortunate algorithms, even worse than the 1, 6, 2.5<sup>times&nbsp;correct&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</sup> rule from SuperMemo-2. They instead have picked out other interval patterns, seemingly from thin air:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://knowledge.wanikani.com/wanikani/srs-stages/">For WaniKani</a>: 4 hours, 8 hours, 1 day, 2 days, 7 days, 14 days, 1 month, 4 months, never seen again</li>
<li><a href="https://community.bunpro.jp/t/bunpro-faq-frequently-asked-questions/876/1#heading--21">For Bunpro</a>: 4 hours, 8 hours, 1 day, 2 days, 4 days, 8 days, 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, never seen again</li>
</ul>
<p>These intervals don’t change per user or per card: they don’t even have an adjustable difficulty factor like the 2.5 base. And the idea that you’ll literally never see a card again after the last interval is terrifying, as it means you’re constantly losing knowledge.</p>
<p>But these aren’t even the worst part: the worst thing about these sites’ algorithms is that failing a card <em>moves it down one or two steps in the interval ladder</em>, instead of resetting to the first interval like SuperMemo-2, or predicting the best next interval using machine learning like FSRS. This greatly sabotages retention, wastes a lot of user time, and in general transforms these sites into a daily ritual of feeling bad about what you’ve forgotten, instead of feeling good about what you’ve retained. I wrote about this <a href="https://community.bunpro.jp/t/bunpros-bad-srs-algorithm-is-discouraging/90066">on the Bunpro forums</a> when I decided to ragequit about a year ago, in favor of Anki.</p>
<p>Stepping back, my takeaway from this experience is that Anki is king. People complain about how its UI is created by developers instead of designers, or how you have to find or make your own decks instead of using prepackaged ones. These are all fair complaints. But Anki is maintained by people who actually care about learning efficiently. It receives <a href="https://github.com/ankitects/anki/releases">frequent updates</a> that make it better at that goal. And it’s flexible enough to carry you through any stage of your knowledge-acquisition journey. Putting in the time to master it will provide a foundation that lasts you a literal lifetime.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Something that’s painfully understudied is how experts are more efficient
than novices while achieving better results. I say understudied and not
unstudied, because it’s common knowledge that charging people for their time
results in experts being paid less since they work faster, which is why experts
charge more for their time.</p>
<p>This effect is understudied in the impact it has on novices entering a field. A
Novice will start out being woefully inefficient, putting in incredible amounts
of effort and running through all number of mental hoops in order to maintain
the growing pile of unmaintainable abstractions they’ve developed. An expert
doesn’t have to jump through these hoops. They can more clearly see the actual
problem at hand and will more efficiently put their time and effort towards
making progress against the problem. In contrast, novices will spend more time
battling problems they created for themselves. Let’s explore this idea by
looking at two characters entrapped in a maze, and how they go about escaping.</p>
<h3 id="stuck-in-a-maze-expert-vs-novice">Stuck in a maze: Expert vs Novice</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine a world-class navigator being set in a maze. They come well prepared
with compass and paper, and have previously escaped some of the most
dastardly mazes designed by man. Also, imagine yourself. You’re the Novice in
this scenario. You didn’t realise you were being thrown into a maze. You
don’t even know if the goal is to get out or to find the centre.</p>
<p>As you go deeper and deeper into the maze, you realise that you’re helplessly
lost. Through a miracle of literary convenience, your expert friend calls you
up and offers advice: “As soon as you start, keep track of where you’ve been
using your ball of twine. It’ll help you keep track of the decisions you make”.</p>
<p>You didn’t realise the criticality of feline playthings, and so didn’t bring
a ball of twine. You also don’t remember where you started. You ask your
expert friend for advice on what to do, to which they respond “Oh I’ve got no
idea. I never go anywhere without my ball of twine. You just shouldn’t have
gotten yourself into this mess in the first place.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of the trickiest tangles I’ve tackled haven’t been because the core
problem is difficult, but rather because I was helping someone with less
experience, and they spent several hours getting themselves more and more tied
up. Before asking for help, they made a wrong decision, which maybe solved
their short term problems but shot them in the foot in the long term. This bad
decision made other bad decisions more likely until they were helplessly stuck
in a trap of their own making.</p>
<p>Often this trap is far trickier than anything an expert would let themselves
get into. Novices, on the other hand, can easily make a sequence of bad
decisions that result in an ever increasing cost of solving the problem at
hand. Not only are you lost in the maze without your twine, but you also went
in a mysterious cave that looked kinda interesting at first and now you’re lost
in the dark. Meanwhile, the world-class expert is happily skipping through the
warm sunny parts of the maze, because they knew that the cave would eventually
lead to a dead end.</p>
<p>I’d like to stress at this point that this is in no way the Novice’s fault.
They followed the same policy as any expert: “take best action available to you
at the time”. Telling a Novice to “just be better” is not constructive
feedback. This feedback does not lead to them improving over time, since from
the only perspective that matters in this scenario (the Novice’s), they were
taking the best action available to them. And if you’re giving feedback that
doesn’t lead to improvement, what’s the point of the feedback?</p>
<h3 id="the-novice-has-a-genius-idea">The Novice has a genius idea</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Still lost in the maze, you keep walking. Your friend mentioned the ball of
twine, and after thinking for a bit you realise your woollen jumper, if
carefully dismantled, could be a good replacement. Dutifully and with a
concrete objective, you sit down and begin to unravel your jumper. After an
hour or so, you’ve got your ball of yarn. After some failed attempts at
unspooling the yarn behind you, you realise one strand of yarn is hopelessly
weak. You decide to braid the yarn, and sit down for another hour to do so.
It’s pretty boring, but you assume that this is just what solving mazes is
all about.</p>
<p>A bit later, your expert friend calls you up and lambastes you for wasting
time with this yarn business. “It was clearly never going to work” he says.
He instructs you to use broken branches from the hedge that makes up
the maze as a way of marking your path. You hadn’t realised the maze was made
of hedge until this point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Novices often spend energy fixing things that are orthogonal to the actual
problem they want to solve, whereas experts are able to better direct their
energy towards the problems they want to solve. This leads to novices having an
extremely distorted view of a field, because the problems they end up solving
are both more difficult and less interesting than those being tackled by
experts. Nobody wants to put more effort into figuring out a more boring
problem.</p>
<h3 id="the-novices-search-strategy">The Novice’s search strategy</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, with a means of marking the paths you’ve taken, you set out to
traverse the maze. Or maybe to escape it, you’re still not sure. You stride
along, breaking and placing branches as you go. You’re not really sure which
paths are the best, so you mostly just pick at random.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a Novice, the vast majority of decisions have to be made essentially
randomly, with very little information going into the choice. If all decisions
were sequential and did not depend on any other decision, a dedicated Novice
could come up with a solution better than random chance after thinking hard
about the decision. But the world we live in is fractal and complexly
dependent; many decisions depend on other decisions in ways that a Novice has
no idea about. Even a dedicated Novice will be confronted with situations in
which they must make several inter-dependent decisions before they can get
feedback on the efficacy of those decisions. The Novice is (at first) forced to
make completely arbitrary choices and face the consequences. Hopefully they can
learn which consequences were due to which decisions, but this isn’t always
feasible.</p>
<p>From the perspective of an expert, the decisions taken while solving a problem
are often second nature, and yet are carefully crafted so as to avoid
unnecessary trouble down the road. A Novice looking upon an expert’s work would
be hard-pressed to distinguish these few important decisions (based on years of
hard work and study) from the myriad of far less important decisions (based
largely on personal taste).</p>
<h3 id="novices-dont-even-see-the-decision">Novices don’t even see the decision</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>You’re breezing through a particularly long and straight bit of the maze when
your expert friend calls you up once again. “Why didn’t you take that right a
few meters back?”, they ask. There was none, you assert, and glancing behind
you confirms this fact.</p>
<p>Just in case, you retrace your steps, and sure enough there’s a sliver of a
gap in the hedges which you suppose could be a path to take. It’s terribly
cramped and overgrown compared to the wide clean paths you’ve been taking so
far, but it <em>is</em> a path. Looking around carefully now, you realise the hedges
are actually packed with cracks and gaps and thin spots. Who knows how many
paths you’ve missed?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes the Novice doesn’t even know that there’s a decision to make. When
the decision is pointed out by the friendly expert, the Novice can often either
make the correct decision or appreciate the correct solution when it’s shown to
them. But the Novice <em>didn’t even know there was a decision in the first
place</em>. This makes it incredibly difficult for the ambitious Novice to make
progress without outside help. They cannot just “check their work for
mistakes”, because for any substantial body of work the Novice likely wouldn’t
be able to point out half their decisions.</p>
<h3 id="experts-cant-explain-their-decisions">Experts can’t explain their decisions</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>You squeeze through this gap in the hedge recommended by your expert friend.
Before long, you come to a fork in the maze: one path leads left, the other
right. The left path looks a bit wider and a bit brighter, but having learnt
from your mistakes you decide to call up your expert friend to get their
advice and learn from their wisdom. “The right path is better.”, your friend
declares. You ask for an explanation, but they are unable to give anything
more specific than “The right path is a stronger option, it’s clearly got the
right look about it. There’s no chance it’ll let you down.”</p>
<p>Frustrated at the lack of intelligible wisdom, you take the right path. And
sure enough, it looks like it was the correct decision. The path clears up
and starts to head towards the exit, as far as you can tell. But you still
don’t understand what your expert friend saw, and it seems like they don’t
understand what they saw either.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The expert’s intuition is often formidable, but rarely comprehensible. This
inability to clearly explain their decisions is what makes it so useful for
novices to spend time with experts. Often there’s an underlying pattern that
the novice can pick up through careful observation, even if neither the expert
nor the novice can properly articulate this pattern.</p>
<h3 id="the-experts-ensemble">The Expert’s ensemble</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Your expert friend is chastising you for missing the obvious gap in the
hedge, and for not realising you could climb over hedges, and for not
bringing a hedge trimmer, and for a myriad of other choices that you made
without even realising you had the option to do differently. As your eyes
glaze over, you hear someone call to your friend through the phone. Turns
out, your expert friend has expert friends of their own, and they’re all
helping each other! “I thought I was meant to figure it out on my own” you
cry, but your friend asks whatever gave you that idea.</p>
<p>You ask how you too can get a network of peers who can help you through the
maze. Your friend says to join some online chat rooms. Unfortunately for you,
they’re all speaking incomprehensible jargon or debating optimal twine
spooling techniques.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Experts often have either a network of people, or (more frequently nowadays)
know the online network of websites and usernames which can guide their
thoughts. They can quickly distinguish useful insight from helplessly generic
summaries, and don’t have to spend much time looking for the information
they’re after. But a Novice has <em>no clue</em> about how to distinguish the two, nor
how to find communities who can help them effectively.</p>
<h3 id="escape">Escape</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Eventually, you finish the maze. Not wanting to repeat the experience of
being a complete Novice, you dedicate yourself to learning more and to not
falling ill to the traps of being a Novice. But how, exactly, should you do
that?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a Novice, you <em>need</em> to find a sympathetic expert on your side to help you
out and to whom you can ask all questions, regardless of how trivial the
questions might be. A replacement for this is finding a lot of experts so you
can spread the load amongst them. You can go very far online nowadays, and even
more so with AI tools. But many of the above trappings that novice’s succumb to
do not magically disintegrate because you have access to the internet or to a
chatbot. You still don’t know how to recognise subtle decisions. You still
don’t know how to distinguish good ideas from bad. You still don’t know how to
avoid long-term cascades due to bad choices. The internet helps, for sure, but
having someone by your side is monumentally better.</p>
<p>One thing that can be tricky to convey to your friendly expert, is that
sometimes you just need to be able to show them what you’re doing without any
specific question in mind. I’ve often found that I can feel uneasy about what
I’m doing, and then talking with an expert friend will quickly surface that
I’ve made some error that will cause pain later. Having someone who’s happy to
spend time “just talking”, without any specific goal to solve, will go a long
way.</p>
<p>In the workplace, this style of “just talking” interactions between novices and
experts is critical for knowledge transfer and training. But novices rarely
have a voice with key decision makers, and so promoting these interactions is
often neglected. It is not sufficient to instruct senior employees to answer
the newcomer’s questions, since the vast majority of learning comes from a
novice watching how the expert plies their skills, and not from direct
questions and answers. What makes this scenario even trickier is that the
expert will likely think “just talking” interactions are basically worthless,
but answering concrete questions <em>feel</em> much more useful. The novice, on the
other hand, could likely discover answers to concrete questions on their own,
given enough time. But developing the intuitions that come through while an
expert is “just talking” with a novice is incredibly valuable to the novice.
This explains the difficulty of training new employees when all your experts
are working remotely, as remote work practically eliminates any sort of casual
unguided “water-cooler” interaction.</p>
<p>Something you can do independently (and possibly it’s best done without expert
supervision), is exploration of the field. You know nothing, and have no biases
about what may or may not be useful. <em>Any</em> time you come across something that
feels like it has some depth to it, such as a well-written essay series or a
deep technical dive, you need to invest heavily into it. As a novice, your one
advantage is that <em>everything</em> is new and nobody expects you to be fast.
Because of this, you can afford to spend the time to learn as much as possible.</p>
<p>I honestly don’t think it’s possible to overdo this. Spending a week exploring
some specific arcana of your field is probably going to pay dividends, because
all of a sudden you’re expert-level in this (<em>tiny</em>) aspect of the field. You
can go head-to-head with an expert, since they last read about that weird
subdomain 5 years ago. Don’t study the “common” things, but go all-in on the
niche pockets. The common things are common enough that you’ll learn them
through osmosis regardless of what your main activity is. But the niche things
require active study, and ignoring the niches is how you remain a novice.</p>
<p>Amongst all of this, the novice needs courage (to make decisions without
knowing the consequences) and confidence (so that they whole-heartedly commit
to their decisions and grant them the greatest chance of success). These traits
are not trivial, and confidence can easily be crushed by a snide comment from
an expert. I don’t want to imagine how many promising novices have been spurned
by unimpressive experts. In this way, advice from a sour-hearted expert is
worse than no expert advice at all due to the risk of destroying the novice’s
confidence.</p>
<h3 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h3>
<p>The lack of consistent empathy between experts and novices would suggest that,
despite feeling easy, it is in fact difficult. I’ve written more about this
<a href="https://boydkane.com/hard" data-slug="hard">here</a>.</p>
<p>In the extreme case, this lack of empathy leads to experts deriding the work of
novices as not having the prestige/class/taste/status expressed so deftly by
the work of the experts.</p>
<p>This is self-fulfilling: novices will either conform to the expert’s sense of
aesthetics, dismiss the field of study as “not for them”, or (in rare cases)
work incredibly hard to prove the experts wrong after all. In this last case,
the Novice becomes an expert anyway. Experts tend to have an aesthetic
preference towards technically challenging work rather than
simple-but-interesting work, and I’ve written more about this phenomenon here:

          <p>On Tuesday, the federal government's Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism announced that it had terminated research grants to Harvard totalling $450 million, spread out across eight federal agencies. The move comes on the heels of $2.2 billion in earlier cuts and an announcement that the university will be prevented from receiving any future grants. The ongoing campaign appears to be heading toward a point where no researchers at Harvard will receive federal funding.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/anti-semitism-task-force-statement-on-additional-harvard-grants.html">The announcement</a> reiterates accusations that are familiar from earlier federal funding terminations. It references antisemitic incidents during earlier protests about Israel's actions in Gaza and the fact that the Harvard Law Review has taken steps to diversify the authors it publishes, which the government considers illegal discrimination. Notably, the letter does not mention any more recent events, nor Harvard's efforts to address antisemitism on campus, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Harvard’s campus, once a symbol of academic prestige, has become a breeding ground for virtue signaling and discrimination. This is not leadership; it is cowardice. And it’s not academic freedom; it’s institutional disenfranchisement. There is a dark problem on Harvard’s campus, and by prioritizing appeasement over accountability, institutional leaders have forfeited the school's claim to taxpayer support.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's generally difficult to understand the big picture of these cuts and the reasons for them from this announcement. Instead, it has to be pieced together from the multitude of letters that individual agencies have sent Harvard.</p>
<p>Multiple federal agencies, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.283718/gov.uscourts.mad.283718.59.7.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Energy</a><span>,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.283718/gov.uscourts.mad.283718.59.9.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the National Science Foundation</a><span>,</span> and the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.283718/gov.uscourts.mad.283718.59.8.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Department of Defense</a><span>, </span>also sent letters announcing the grant terminations on Tuesday. These sometimes contain more specific accusations, such as the Department of Energy letter, which specifically terms Harvard's efforts to address past problems as insufficient. "Harvard has refused to take immediate, definitive and appropriate remedial action," the letter said.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<p>If you look for information about the Macintosh Plus and its ROM, you’ll usually find that the ROM has a capacity of 128 KB and that it exists in <a href="https://www.tech-insider.org/mac/research/acrobat/8803-f.pdf">three revisions</a>. But that’s incorrect: there’s a fourth ROM, 256 KB in size, which includes fonts for kanji (Japanese characters). And I found (and preserved) this ROM.<br>
<span id="more-112672"></span><br>
I’m Belgian, and the article was originally written in French before being translated automatically.</p>
<p>I had talked about this mysterious ROM <a href="https://www.journaldulapin.com/2019/05/04/macintosh-plus-rom/">a few years ago</a>. It’s documented by Apple in <a href="https://spinsidemacintosh.neocities.org/tn405#tn138">some old documents</a>, but without much detail. According to Apple, the ROM contains fonts for kanji in 12 and 18 points, and they are loaded at startup by <a href="https://www.journaldulapin.com/2018/05/29/kanjitalk-%E6%BC%A2%E5%AD%97talk/">KanjiTalk</a>. On a regular Macintosh Plus, you need a floppy disk with the files, which slows down startup and uses some RAM, whereas on a Japanese Macintosh Plus, the font is in ROM and doesn’t take up RAM. You also avoid loading files from a floppy disk, theoretically saving 6 seconds during startup. That’s a conservative estimate, as we’ll see—it assumes you’re not switching disks manually.</p>
<div id="attachment_112658"><p><a href="https://www.journaldulapin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/01-4.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-112658" src="https://www.journaldulapin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/01-4-640x360.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.journaldulapin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/01-4-640x360.jpg 640w, https://www.journaldulapin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/01-4-850x478.jpg 850w, https://www.journaldulapin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/01-4-320x180.jpg 320w, https://www.journaldulapin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/01-4-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.journaldulapin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/01-4-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.journaldulapin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/01-4.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-112658">When booting with a Western ROM, it asks for the floppy with the 12-point font</p></div>
<p>Now, one question remained: how to find the ROM? Getting a Japanese Macintosh Plus shipped was out of the question—it’s bulky and heavy, and there was no guarantee that it had the Japanese ROM… or even that it existed. Searching the internet brings up <a href="https://68kmla.org/bb/index.php?threads/unique-japanese-mac-plus-rom.33029/">this thread</a> questioning its existence, and <a href="https://tinkerdifferent.com/threads/the-mac-plus-kanji-rom.1088/">another one</a> explaining that according to failed tests (as we’ll see), the Japanese ROM has the same content as a v2 ROM. A Japanese author <a href="https://note.com/kaigian/n/n40f4c4248e96">tried</a> to find information with no success (he concluded that the ROM was 128 KB, not 256 KB). But <a href="http://tamaru.world.coocan.jp/Tips/ROM/rom.html">this other Japanese site</a> does reference the Japanese ROM (<code>342-0441-A</code> and <code>342-0442-A</code>), and <a href="http://web.kyoto-inet.or.jp/people/s-oga/mac80/index.html">this one</a> confirms a 256 KB capacity.</p>
<p>In short, no one really knew if the ROM existed, but there were quite a few clues. So I kept digging. Instead of looking for a full Macintosh Plus, I searched for a Macintosh Plus motherboard in Japan, hoping a seller would upload photos that showed the chip references. My first purchase failed: the reference wasn’t fully readable, but the yellow sticker misled me.</p>
<div id="attachment_112661"><p><a href="https://www.journaldulapin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/04-3.jpeg"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-112661" src="https://www.journaldulapin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/04-3-640x459.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="459" srcset="https://www.journaldulapin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/04-3-640x459.jpeg 640w, https://www.journaldulapin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/04-3-850x609.jpeg 850w, https://www.journaldulapin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/04-3-320x229.jpeg 320w, https://www.journaldulapin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/04-3-768x550.jpeg 768w, https://www.journaldulapin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/04-3-1536x1101.jpeg 1536w, https://www.journaldulapin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/04-3-2048x1468.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-112661">This time, it’s the right one.</p></div>
<p>With the second one, I had the correct chip reference—and a yellow sticker again. I now had a Macintosh Plus motherboard and its ROM, but no actual Macintosh Plus to test it on. The first step was trying to dump the ROM (two chips), but it didn’t work at first. I used an old device for the dump and ended up with two 64 KB files, which wasn’t what I expected. But I didn’t give up, for a simple reason I noticed with the help <a href="https://x86.fr/">of Doc TB</a>: the markings on the chips indicated a 1,024 kilobit capacity, meaning 128 KB.</p>
<div id="attachment_112660"><p><a href="https://www.journaldulapin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/03-3.jpeg"><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-112660" src="https://www.journaldulapin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/03-3-640x468.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="468" srcset="https://www.journaldulapin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/03-3-640x468.jpeg 640w, https://www.journaldulapin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/03-3-850x622.jpeg 850w, https://www.journaldulapin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/03-3-320x234.jpeg 320w, https://www.journaldulapin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/03-3-768x562.jpeg 768w, https://www.journaldulapin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/03-3-1536x1124.jpeg 1536w, https://www.journaldulapin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/03-3-2048x1498.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-112660">The marking helped, with the 1024 in the reference.</p></div>
<p>I had followed the information on <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Create-Macintosh-Plus-ROMs/">this site</a>, which says the Macintosh Plus can use 27C512 chips (64 KB), and I didn’t understand how you could have a 128 KB ROM with that pinout. Until I found a page that explained it. On <a href="http://www.synack.net/~bbraun/plusrom/index.html">Rob Braun’s site</a>, it’s clearly stated that the Macintosh Plus has a slightly different pinout than a 27C512 chip. It includes one extra address line, allowing it to address 128 KB, placed where the programming voltage pin would normally be. Since the Macintosh Plus socket isn’t meant for writing to an EPROM, this is entirely transparent. Doc TB helped again: <a href="https://x86.fr/the-uca-now-supports-roms-eeproms/">he developed a device</a> that can read many ROM and EPROM types, and he was able to dump my two chips. With a standard adapter, it’s not really possible directly, since it’s a proprietary pinout. That was the earlier cited person’s mistake: the lower half of Apple’s ROM (128 KB) matches a standard ROM.</p>

<p>Before continuing, <a href="http://down.dandu.be/MacPlusROMv4.zip">here’s a link to the files</a>.</p>
<h3>Testing the Japanese ROM</h3>
<p>At this point, I had a 256 KB dump of the Japanese Macintosh Plus ROM… but nothing to test it with. I didn’t have a Macintosh Plus (just two motherboards), and my first emulator tests failed. The reason is simple: they expect a known ROM, and not necessarily a Macintosh Plus ROM. That’s important to remember when it comes to Mac emulation—there are many models, and emulators don’t always emulate a specific Mac. Sometimes it’s more like a clone, as with Basilisk or SheepShaver. Technically, they emulate something close to a compatible machine. Mini vMac is better suited for this, but it checks the ROM’s checksum, so I couldn’t boot with mine—it’s not in the recognized list.</p>
<p>That’s when I asked for help. And I’d like to thank <a href="https://x86.fr/">Samuel</a> (for the ROM dump), <a href="https://www.polysoft.fr/">Gilles</a>—for the Macintosh Plus—and <a href="https://www.downtowndougbrown.com/">Doug</a>, for the software part.</p>
<p>Let’s talk hardware first. I didn’t have a Macintosh Plus, just a <a href="https://www.journaldulapin.com/2017/04/10/usb-souris-m0100/">mouse</a>. Gilles sent me a Macintosh Plus and a keyboard (which didn’t work). But with a <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/lazaj/ps2-keyboard-to-macintosh-plus/">PS/2 adapter</a>, I managed. I had originally considered using the <a href="https://www.journaldulapin.com/2017/02/04/floppy-emu-macintosh/">Floppy Emu</a>, but I got odd results, and the sound of the floppy drive is more satisfying anyway. So I pulled out two 800 KB 3.5″ floppy disks to copy KanjiTalk 1.0 onto them. A tip: KanjiTalk really doesn’t like running from an English system—every time I put the system disk into a newer Mac, I couldn’t boot again on the Macintosh Plus without recreating the disk.</p>
<p>Now for the software part. First, I had to find an old version of KanjiTalk. You can (for example) find it on <a href="https://macintoshgarden.org/apps/kanjitalk">Macintosh Garden</a> or on <a href="https://winworldpc.com/product/mac-os-0-6/system-3x">WinWorld</a>. KanjiTalk 1.0 is based on System 3.1 and comes on two floppies. The first is 800 KB and holds the system itself. The second contains the fonts and is 400 KB (I copied it to an 800 KB disk with no issue).</p>

<p>This is where the Japanese ROM shines. The usual behavior on a Western Macintosh Plus is quite long. After around 10 seconds, the system asks for the font disk to load the 12-point font. After about 6 seconds of loading, it asks again for the system disk. Five seconds later, it loads the 18-point font (13 seconds), and finally it needs 15 more seconds with the system disk. Even if you swap floppies quickly, it still takes over a minute (about 1:14 in my video) and a few steps to get the Macintosh Plus started.</p>

<p>With the Japanese ROM, the system loads the 12-point font from ROM, and asks for the 18-point font disk after a little over 10 seconds. About 12 seconds later, it requests the system disk again, and the rest loads quickly (about 15 seconds). So it avoids a few swaps and the Mac is ready after around 52 seconds.</p>

<p>You can also skip loading the 18-point font entirely, which reduces boot time further—to about 25 seconds. I only tested this with the Japanese ROM because swapping ROMs means disassembling the Macintosh Plus motherboard, and I don’t like getting close to a CRT.</p>
<div id="attachment_112662"><p><a href="https://www.journaldulapin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/05-8.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-112662" src="https://www.journaldulapin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/05-8.png" alt="" width="512" height="342" srcset="https://www.journaldulapin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/05-8.png 512w, https://www.journaldulapin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/05-8-320x214.png 320w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-112662">This checkbox (checked here) prevents loading the 18-point font</p></div>
<p>In any case, it provides a time gain even greater than Apple’s estimate. Booting with the Japanese ROM saves around 15 seconds—and also frees about 113 KB of RAM, which is significant given the Macintosh Plus could be limited to just 1 MB. Skipping the 18-point font saves even more RAM, since it uses slightly more memory.</p>

<h3>The Emulation Case</h3>
<p>This part is a bit tricky. By default, emulators don’t recognize the 256 KB ROM and won’t run it. Doug, much more experienced than I am in development, modified <a href="https://www.mamedev.org/">MAME</a> to allow the Japanese ROM. It works the same as a regular Macintosh: with a standard ROM, you’ll need the font disk. With the Japanese ROM, you’ll only need it for the optional 18-point font. My tests with a manually compiled version were successful, and the necessary changes to use the Japanese ROM with MAME should be integrated into the software soon.</p>

        <h2>Welcome to FreeBASIC</h2>
        <p>
          FreeBASIC is a free/open source (GPL), BASIC compiler for Microsoft Windows, DOS and Linux.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          When used in its "QB" language mode, FreeBASIC provides a high level of support for programs
          written for QuickBASIC. Many programs written for QuickBASIC will compile and run in this mode
          with no changes needed. However, for compilation in the FreeBASIC default language mode,
          most substantial programs will require changes.

          FreeBASIC is a self-hosting compiler which makes use of the GNU binutils programming tools as
          backends and can produce console, graphical/GUI executables, dynamic and static libraries.
          FreeBASIC fully supports the use of C libraries and has partial C++ library support. This lets
          programmers use and create libraries for C and many other languages. It supports a C style
          preprocessor, capable of multiline macros, conditional compiling and file inclusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          FreeBASIC has been rated close in speed with mainstream tools, such as GCC.
        </p>

        <h2>More about FreeBASIC</h2>
        <p>
          The FreeBASIC project is a set of cross-platform development tools, consisting of a compiler, 
          GNU-based assembler, linker and archiver, and supporting runtime libraries, including a software-based 
          graphics library. The compiler, fbc, currently supports building for i386-based architectures on the DOS, 
          Linux, Windows and Xbox platforms. The project also contains thin bindings (header files) to some popular 
          3rd party libraries such as the C runtime library, Allegro, SDL, OpenGL, GTK+, the Windows API and many 
          others, as well as example programs for many of these libraries.
        </p>
        <p>
          FreeBASIC is a high-level programming language supporting procedural, object-orientated and
          meta-programming paradigms, with a syntax compatible to Microsoft QuickBASIC. In fact, the
          FreeBASIC project originally began as an attempt to create a code-compatible, free alternative
          to Microsoft QuickBASIC, but it has since grown into a powerful development tool. FreeBASIC
          can be seen to extend the capabilities of Microsoft QuickBASIC in a number of ways, supporting
          more data types, language constructs, programming styles, and modern platforms and APIs.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Any type of program can be written with FreeBASIC, see our <a href="https://freebasic.net/gallery.html">Gallery of Applications</a>
        	for some notable examples.

            <span>Abstract:</span>We directly compare the persuasion capabilities of a frontier large language model (LLM; Claude Sonnet 3.5) against incentivized human persuaders in an interactive, real-time conversational quiz setting. In this preregistered, large-scale incentivized experiment, participants (quiz takers) completed an online quiz where persuaders (either humans or LLMs) attempted to persuade quiz takers toward correct or incorrect answers. We find that LLM persuaders achieved significantly higher compliance with their directional persuasion attempts than incentivized human persuaders, demonstrating superior persuasive capabilities in both truthful (toward correct answers) and deceptive (toward incorrect answers) contexts. We also find that LLM persuaders significantly increased quiz takers' accuracy, leading to higher earnings, when steering quiz takers toward correct answers, and significantly decreased their accuracy, leading to lower earnings, when steering them toward incorrect answers. Overall, our findings suggest that AI's persuasion capabilities already exceed those of humans that have real-money bonuses tied to performance. Our findings of increasingly capable AI persuaders thus underscore the urgency of emerging alignment and governance frameworks.

            <span>Abstract:</span>Transformer based large-language models (LLMs) display extreme proficiency with language yet a precise understanding of how they work remains elusive. One way of demystifying transformer predictions would be to describe how they depend on their context in terms of simple template functions. This paper takes a first step in this direction by considering families of functions (i.e. rules) formed out of simple N-gram based statistics of the training data. By studying how well these rulesets approximate transformer predictions, we obtain a variety of novel discoveries: a simple method to detect overfitting during training without using a holdout set, a quantitative measure of how transformers progress from learning simple to more complex statistical rules over the course of training, a model-variance criterion governing when transformer predictions tend to be described by N-gram rules, and insights into how well transformers can be approximated by N-gram rulesets in the limit where these rulesets become increasingly complex. In this latter direction, we find that for 79% and 68% of LLM next-token distributions on TinyStories and Wikipedia, respectively, their top-1 predictions agree with those provided by our N-gram rulesets.

<h2 id="chapter-1-the-discovery">Chapter 1: The discovery</h2>

<p>I have a Wacom drawing tablet. I use it to draw cover illustrations for my blog posts, such as this one:</p>

<p><img src="https://robertheaton.com/images/wacom-cover.png"></p>

<p>Last week I set up my tablet on my new laptop. As part of installing its drivers I was asked to accept Wacom’s privacy policy.</p>

<p>Being a mostly-normal person I never usually read privacy policies. Instead I vigorously hammer the “yes” button in an effort to reach the game, machine, or medical advice on the other side of the agreement as fast as possible. But Wacom’s request made me pause. Why does a device that is essentially a mouse need a privacy policy? I wondered. Sensing skullduggery, I decided to make an exception to my anti-privacy-policy-policy and give this one a read.</p>

<p>In Wacom’s defense (that’s the only time you’re going to see that phrase today), the document was short and clear, although as we’ll see it wasn’t entirely open about its more dubious intentions (<a href="https://gist.github.com/robert/9690e0f0cf4f72a9f51e36952c2776e2">here’s the full text</a>). In addition, despite its attempts to look like the kind of compulsory agreement that must be accepted in order to unlock the product behind it, as far as I can tell anyone with the presence of mind to decline it could do so with no adverse consequences.</p>

<p>With that attempt at even-handedness out the way, let’s get kicking.</p>

<p>In section 3.1 of their privacy policy, Wacom wondered if it would be OK if they sent a few bits and bobs of data from my computer to Google Analytics, “[including] aggregate usage data, technical session information and information about [my] hardware device.” The half of my heart that cares about privacy sank. The other half of my heart, the half that enjoys snooping on snoopers and figuring out what they’re up to, leapt. It was a disjointed feeling, probably similar to how it feels to get mugged by your favorite TV magician.</p>

<p><img src="https://robertheaton.com/images/wacom-policy.png"></p>

<p>Wacom didn’t say exactly what data they were going to send themselves. I resolved to find out.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="chapter-2-snooping-on-the-snoopers">Chapter 2: Snooping on the snoopers</h2>

<p>I began my investigation with a strong presumption of chicanery. I was unable to imagine the project kickoff meeting in which Wacom decided to bundle Google Analytics with their device, which - remember - is essentially a mouse, but managed to restrain themselves from also grabbing some deliciously intrusive information while they were at it. I Googled “wacom google analytics”. There were a couple of Tweets and Reddit posts made by people who had also read Wacom’s privacy policy and been unhappy about its contents, but no one had yet tried to find out exactly what data Wacom were grabbing. No one had investigated Wacom’s understanding of the phrase “aggregate usage data” or whether it was anywhere near that of a reasonable person.</p>

<p>I told my son to clear my schedule. He bashed two wooden blocks together in understanding, encouragement, and sheer admiration.</p>

<p>In order to see what type of data Wacom was exfiltrating from my computer, I needed to snoop on the traffic that their driver was sending to Google Analytics. The most common way to do this is to set up a <em>proxy server</em> on your computer (I usually use <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp">Burp Suite</a>). You tell your target program to send its traffic through your proxy. Your proxy logs the data it receives, and finally re-sends it on to its intended destination. When the destination sends back a response, the same process runs in reverse.</p>

<div><pre><code>+-------------------------------+
|My computer                    |
|                               |
|   +------+        +------+    |    +---------+
|   |Wacom +-------&gt;+Burp  +--------&gt;+Google   |
|   |Driver+&lt;-------+Suite +&lt;--------+Analytics|
|   +------+        +-+----+    |    +---------+
|                     | Log requests and responses
|                     v         |
|             /track?data=...   |
|                               |
+---------------------+---------+
</code></pre></div>

<p>Some applications, like web browsers, co-operate very well with proxies. They allow users to explicitly specify a proxy for them to to send their traffic through. However, other applications (including the Wacom tablet drivers) provide no such conveniences. Instead, they require some special treatment.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-3-wireshark">Chapter 3: Wireshark</h2>

<p>I started with a simple approach that was unlikely to work but was worth a try. I opened <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a>, a program that watches your computer’s network traffic. I wanted to use Wireshark to view the raw bytes that the Wacom driver was sending to Google Analytics. If Wacom was sending my data over unencrypted HTTP then I’d immediately be able to see all of its gory details, no extra work required. On the other hand, if Wacom was using <a href="https://robertheaton.com/2014/03/27/how-does-https-actually-work/">encrypted TLS/HTTPS</a> then I would be foiled. The traffic would appear as garbled nonsense that I would be unable to decrypt, since I wouldn’t know the keys used to encrypt it. I closed any noisy, network-connecting programs to reduce the chatter on the line, pressed Wireshark’s record button, and held onto my hat.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, no unencrypted HTTP traffic appeared; only encrypted, garbled TLS. But there was good news amidst this setback. Wireshark also picks up DNS requests, which are used to look up the IP address that corresponds to a domain. I saw that my computer was making DNS requests to look up the IP address of <code>www.google-analytics.com</code>. The DNS response was coming back as <code>172.217.7.14</code>, and lots of TLS-encrypted traffic was then heading out to that IP address. This meant that <em>something</em> was indeed talking to Google Analytics.</p>

<p><img src="https://robertheaton.com/images/wacom-dns.png"></p>

<p>I switched tactics and fired up Burp Suite proxy.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-4-burp-suite">Chapter 4: Burp Suite</h2>

<p>I now had two problems. First, I needed to persuade Wacom to send its Google Analytics traffic through Burp Suite. Second, I needed to make sure that Wacom would then complete a <em>TLS handshake</em> with Burp. To solve the first problem, I configured my laptop’s global HTTP and HTTPS proxies to point to Burp Suite. This meant that every program that respected these global settings would send its traffic through my proxy.</p>

<p><img src="https://robertheaton.com/images/wacom-proxy-settings.png"></p>

<p>Happily, it turned out that Wacom did respect my global proxy settings - my proxy quickly started logging “client failed TLS handshake” messages.</p>

<p>This brought me to my second problem. Since Wacom was talking to Google Analytics over TLS, it required the server to present a valid TLS certificate for  <code>www.google-analytics.com</code>. As far as Wacom is concerned, my proxy was now the server that it is talking to, not Google Analytics itself. This meant that I needed my proxy to present a certificate that Wacom would trust.</p>

<div><pre><code>  (Burp must present a valid cert for www.google-analytics.com)
                      |
+---------------------|---------+
|My computer          |         |
|                     v         |
|   +------+        +------+    |    +---------+
|   |Wacom +-------&gt;+Burp  +--------&gt;+Google   |
|   |Driver+&lt;-------+Suite +&lt;--------+Analytics|
|   +------+        +-+----+    |    +---------+
|                     | Log requests and responses
|                     v         |
|             /track?data=...   |
|                               |
+---------------------+---------+
</code></pre></div>

<p>The most difficult part of presenting such a certificate is that it needs to be <em>cryptographically signed</em> by a <em>certificate authority</em> that the program trusts. Burp Suite can generate and sign certificates for any domain, no problem, but since by default no computer or program trusts Burp Suite as a certificate authority, the certificates it signs are rejected (I’ve written much more about TLS and HTTPS <a href="https://robertheaton.com/2014/03/27/how-does-https-actually-work/">here</a> and <a href="https://robertheaton.com/2018/11/28/https-in-the-real-world/">here</a>).</p>

<p>Once again, the process of persuading a web browser to trust Burp’s root certificate is well-documented, but for a thick application like Wacom I’d need to do something slightly different. I therefore used OSX’s Keychain to temporarily add Burp’s certificate to my computer’s list of root certificates.</p>

<p><img src="https://robertheaton.com/images/wacom-cert.png"></p>

<p>I assumed that Wacom would load its list of root certificates from my computer, and that by adding Burp to this list, Wacom would start to trust Burp and would complete a TLS handshake with my proxy.</p>

<p>I sat and waited. I watched Wireshark and Burp at the same time. If Wacom failed to connect to Burp, I’d see this failure in Wireshark. I was quite excited.</p>

<p>Nothing happened.</p>

<p>I wondered if the data dumping was triggered by a timer, or by some particular activity, or by both. I tried drawing something using my Wacom tablet. Still nothing. I plugged and unplugged it. Nothing. Then I went into the Wacom Driver Settings and restarted the driver.</p>

<p><img src="https://robertheaton.com/images/wacom-restart.png"></p>

<p>Everything happened.</p>

<p>When I restarted the Wacom driver, rather than lose all the data it had accumulated, the driver fired off everything it had collected to Google Analytics. This data materialized in my Burp Suite. I took a look. My heart experienced the same half-down-half-up schism as it had half an hour ago.</p>

<p>Some of the events that Wacom were recording were arguably within their purview, such as “driver started” and “driver shutdown”. I still don’t want them to take this information because there’s nothing in it for me, but their attempt to do so feels broadly justifiable. What requires more explanation is why Wacom think it’s acceptable to record every time I open a new application, including the time, a string that presumably uniquely identifies me, and the application’s name.</p>

<p><img src="https://robertheaton.com/images/wacom-evidence-4.png"></p>

<hr>

<h2 id="chapter-5-analysis">Chapter 5: Analysis</h2>

<p>I suspect that Wacom doesn’t really think that it’s acceptable to record the name of every application I open on my personal laptop. I suspect that this is why their privacy policy doesn’t really admit that this is what that they do. I imagine that if pressed they would argue that the name of every application I open on my personal laptop falls into one of their broad buckets like “aggregate data” or “technical session information”, although it’s not immediately obvious to me which bucket.</p>

<p>It’s well-known that no one reads privacy policies and that they’re often a fig leaf of consent at best. But since Wacom’s privacy policy makes no mention of their intention to record the name of every application I open on my personal laptop, I’d argue that it doesn’t even give them the technical-fig-leaf-right to do so. In fact, I’d argue that even if someone had read and understood Wacom’s privacy policy, and had knowingly consented to a reasonable interpretation of the words inside it, that person would still not have agreed to allow Wacom to log and track the name of every application that they opened on their personal laptop.</p>

<p>Of course, I’m not a lawyer, and I assume that whoever wrote this privacy policy is.</p>

<p>Wacom’s privacy policy does say that they only want this data for product development purposes, and on this point I do actually believe them. This might be naive, since who knows what goes on behind the scenes when large troves of data are involved. Either way, while I do understand that product developers like to have usage data in order to monitor and improve their offerings, this doesn’t give them the right to take it.</p>

<hr>

<p>I care about this for two reasons.</p>

<p>The first is a principled fuck you. I don’t care whether anything materially bad will or won’t happen as a consequence of Wacom taking this data from me. I simply resent the fact that they’re doing it.</p>

<p>The second is that we can also come up with scenarios that involve real harms. Maybe the very existence of a program is secret or sensitive information. What if a Wacom employee suddenly starts seeing entries spring up for “Half Life 3 Test Build”? Obviously I don’t care about the secrecy of Valve’s new games, but I assume that Valve does.</p>

<p>We can get more subtle. I personally use Google Analytics to track visitors to my website. I do feel bad about this, but I’ve got to get my self-esteem from somewhere. Google Analytics has a “User Explorer” tool, in which you can zoom in on the activity of a specific user. Suppose that someone at Wacom “fingerprints” a target person that they knew in real life by seeing that this person uses a very particular combination of applications. The Wacom employee then uses this fingerprint to find the person in the “User Explorer” tool. Finally the Wacom employee sees that their target also uses “LivingWith: Cancer Support”.</p>

<p>Remember, this information is coming from a device that is essentially a mouse.</p>

<p>This example is admittedly a little contrived, but it’s also an illustration that, even though this data doesn’t come with a name and social security number attached, it is neither benign nor inert.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="chapter-6-conclusion">Chapter 6: Conclusion</h2>

<p>In some ways it feels unfair to single out Wacom. This isn’t the dataset that’s going to complete the embrace of full, totalitarian surveillance capitalism. Nonetheless, it’s still deeply obnoxious. A device that is essentially a mouse has no legitimate reasons to make HTTP requests of any sort. Maybe Wacom could hide in the sweet safety of murky territory if they released some sort of mobile app integration or a weekly personal usage report that required this data, but until then I’m happy to classify them as an obligingly clear case of nefariousness.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I’m not about to incinerate my Wacom tablet and buy a different one. These things are expensive, and privacy is hard to put a price on. If you too have a Wacom tablet (presumably this tracking is enabled for all of their models), open up the “Wacom Desktop Center” and click around until you find a way to disable the “Wacom Experience Program”. Then the next time you’re buying a tablet, remember that Wacom tries to track every app you open, and consider giving another brand a go.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>

<p>I finished the first draft of this article three weeks ago. I set up Burp Suite proxy again so that I could grab some final screenshots of the data that Wacom was purloining. I restarted the Wacom driver, as per usual. But nothing happened. Wacom weren’t illegitimately siphoning off my personal usage data any more.</p>

<p>The bastards.</p>

<p>I contemplated pretending I hadn’t seen this and publishing my post anyway. Then I contemplated publishing it with an additional coda explaining this latest development. However, the title “Wacom drawing tablets used to track the name of every application that you open but now seem to have stopped for some reason” didn’t feel very snappy. I decided to do some more investigating.</p>

<p>I had previously noticed that, before sending data to Google Analytics, the Wacom driver sent a <code>HEAD</code> request to the URL <code>http://link.wacom.com/analytics/analytics.xml</code>. I hadn’t been able to work out why, and until now I hadn’t thought much of it. However, now Wacom was responding to this request with a 404 “Not Found” status code instead of 200 “OK”. I realized that the request must be some kind of pre-flight check that allowed Wacom to turn off analytics collection remotely without requiring users to install a driver update. Now that the request was failing, Wacom were not sending themselves my data.</p>

<p>I dug around in the driver’s logfile and found the following snippet that confirmed my suspicions:</p>

<p><img src="https://robertheaton.com/images/wacom-log.png"></p>

<p>I wondered if Wacom had gotten wise to what I was up to and panic-disabled their tracking. This seemed unlikely, although the timing was rather coincidental. I decided that Wacom had probably simply made a boneheaded mistake and accidentally broken their own command-and-control center. I impatiently waited for them to realize their goof and bring their data exfiltration operation back online. I contemplated emailing Wacom to alert them to their problem, but couldn’t come up with a sufficiently innocuous way of doing so.</p>

<p>I decided to wait until the end of the month before doing anything, in case the data was used for generating monthly reports. I hoped that on January 31st Wacom would notice that their graphs were broken and bring their system back online.</p>

<p>On February 3rd I checked in and was elated at what I saw:</p>

<p><img src="https://robertheaton.com/images/wacom-hi-rick.png"></p>

<p>I had no idea who Rick was, but I was glad he was back. Wacom were illegitimately siphoning off my personal data again, and I couldn’t be happier. I grabbed some better screenshots, fixed some grammar, and hit publish. The rest is history.</p>

<p>I wanted to make a programming language that resembled magical circles. This is more like a way to write PostScript that looks like a magical circle, but I will refer to it as Mystical in this document.</p>
<h2>Rings</h2>
<p>The structure of Mystical is based on rings. These are circular bands of text and sigils, with an inner and outer border. The content of the main ring of a program starts at the rightmost (3:00) point and flow continues widdershins (counter-clockwise) both to respect postscript's angles and to reflect the assumption that these rings should be written from the outside.  Subsidiary rings start from their attachment point to their caller.</p>
<p>There are three types of rings in Mystical:</p>
<ul>
<li>executable arrays, written in <code>{</code> <code>}</code> in PostScript, are represented with simple circular borders on the inside and outside of the ring, with a star of some sort inside. The start/end point is marked by a symbol based on the "work complete" symbol from alchemy.</li>
<li>non-executable arrays, written in <code>[</code> <code>]</code> in PostScript, are the same but without the star. The start/end point is marked with a simple triangle.</li>
<li>dictionaries, written in <code>&lt;&lt;</code> <code>&gt;&gt;</code> in PostScript, are polygons with a double outer border and a single inner border. The start/end point is marked the same as the array.</li>
</ul>

<td><code>&lt;&lt; /longname (Mystical) /w 45 /h 8 /x 23 &gt;&gt;</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>(Note that the entries in the dict image are in a different order than the PostScript text since dict insertion order is not preserved in PostScript.)</p>
<p>When one of these structures appear inside a different structure, a small circle or dot at the inclusion point is connected to a line which leads to the subsidiary ring's start/end sigil.</p>
<p><img src="https://suberic.net/~dmm/projects/mystical/images/link_example.png" alt="link example"></p>
<pre><code>[
    0 1 2 1.5 40 360 &lt;&lt;
        /longname (Mystical) /w 45 /h 8 /x 23
    &gt;&gt;
]
</code></pre>
<p>It is theoretically possible to use <code>[ ]</code> and <code>&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;</code> in PostScript in ways that Mystical can't handle:</p>
<pre><code>[ 1 2 3 split { ] /first exch def [ } if 4 5 6 ] /final exch def
</code></pre>
<p>so don't do that.</p>
<p>Other commands like <code>gsave/grestore</code> and <code>begin/end</code> are more likely to be used in non-balanced or loop-crossing ways so those are treated as normal sigils below.</p>
<h2>Text and Sigils</h2>
<p>The rings' rims contain text or sigils.  Sigils are symbols that stand in for operators, variables, or other keywords. Any name, written in PostScript as <code>/name</code>, is instead written with a triangle surrounding or superimposing the text of the name or its sigil.  Any strings, written in () in Postscript, are cartouche-like shapes containing the string text.</p>

<h3>Standard Sigils</h3>
<p>Many built-in operators have been given their own sigils.  These are used in place of the text of the operator if it appears as a name or operator (but not if it appears as a string).  I have generally made these sigils based on the initial of the command and an illustration of the concept, though in some cases I have taken a more fully illustrative route or created some standard visual language.  Some examples are below - see <a href="https://suberic.net/~dmm/projects/mystical/docs/operators.html">Standard Sigils</a> for a full list.</p>

<h3>User Sigils</h3>
<p>Sigils for new functions or names can be added to <code>sigil_bank</code> at runtime.  They should fit into the 1-unit square centered on the origin, so no coordinate should be more than 0.5 (of course, you can transform your coordinate system for convenience).  If you use <code>nstroke</code> instead of <code>stroke</code> you will get the same calligraphic effect as the standard sigils.</p>
<p>Sigils for user variables can be designed with any sigil system.  My examples mostly use letter collision, inspired by Spare's Chaos Magick system, but anything that turns a word into a symbol will work - kameas, wheels, Square Word Calligraphy, Circular Gallifreyan, sitelen sitelen, illustration, puns, etc.  New names based on official operators can incorporate the standard sigils for those operators.</p>

<h2>Ligature for <code>/name { ring } def</code></h2>
<p>There is a sigil for <code>def</code> but a very common pattern is to push a name, push a function, and def the name to the function. To save space and to emphasize this definition, there is special syntax for this case consisting of the usual name triangle with the end of the link line directly below it, and the def sigil is omitted entirely. This is extended to the other two ring types for simplicity. Any other use of <code>def</code> will just use the def sigil as normal.</p>
<table>

<td><code>{ ...  /even { 2 mod 0 eq } def ...  }</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This only applies inside of executable arrays. I considered a similar ligature for /name { ring } in dictionaries but there's too much chance of getting it wrong.</p>
<h2>Sample Algorithms</h2>
<p>Quicksort is the illustration at the top of this page.</p>
<p>Euclid's GCD algorithm (using my <code>/arg {exch def} def</code> function from dmmlib):</p>
<p><img src="https://suberic.net/~dmm/projects/mystical/images/gcd_example.png" alt="gcd example"></p>
<h2>Functions to generate Mystical images</h2>
<p>All of these are defined in "mystical.ps".</p>
<p><code>mystical</code>: takes an array, xarray, or dict and renders it in mystical, descending into substructures as necessary.  The entire image will be scaled to fit into a unit circle.</p>
<p><code>mystical_evoke</code>: The same as <code>mystical</code> but it takes a name that is looked up in the current dictionary.</p>
<p><code>mystical_evoke_label</code>:  Like <code>mystical_evoke</code> but adds a name-def ligature with the name at the top and orients the image so that the name sigil is right-side-up.</p>
<p>All of these have versions with <code>_unscaled</code> appended to them that skip the scaling step.  The rings will be 1 unit thick so the image will be quite large.</p>
<h3>layout issues</h3>
<p>Currently the code figures out the layout of the subcircles so that nothing collides, but it's overly safe so most programs will be very spread out.  For the examples on this page I ran the parsing/layout functions (<code>mystical_get_spell</code> and <code>mystical_make_evocation_ligature</code>) and then adjusted the results before calling the draw functions <code>draw_sigil</code> and <code>draw_link</code>.  I'm intending to improve the default layout somewhat.</p>
<h2>Is this a programming language?</h2>
<p>At the moment it's a way to draw a PostScript program - there's no interpreter that will ingest a Mystical image and perform the appropriate computation.  It could be run and interpreted by a human, or (more likely) a human could read it and turn it into a PostScript program and run that.  I'll leave further philosophical arguments to other people for now.</p>
<h2>Could this work for other languages?</h2>
<p>This approach seems applicable to other language with just operators, such as Forth. Languages with more complicated statements might be more difficult, and I don't know if a new ring for every brace or indent will be overly busy.</p>

<p>Three guys claim that any heavy chunk of matter emits Hawking radiation, even if it’s not a black hole:</p>
<p>• Michael F. Wondrak, Walter D. van Suijlekom and Heino Falcke, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18521">Gravitational pair production and black hole evaporation</a>, <i>Phys. Rev. Lett.</i> <b>130</b> (2023), 221502.</p>
<p>Now they’re getting more publicity by claiming this means that the universe will fizzle out sooner than we expected.  <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2025/05/023">They’re claiming</a>, for example, that a dead, cold star will emit Hawking radiation, and thus slowly lose mass and eventually disappear!</p>
<p>They admit that this would violate baryon conservation: after all, the protons and neutrons in the star would have to go away somehow!  They admit they don’t know how this would work.  They just say that the gravitational field of the star will create particle-antiparticle pairs that will slowly radiate away, forcing the dead star to lose mass <em>somehow</em> to conserve energy.</p>
<p>If experts thought this had even a chance of being true, it would be the biggest thing since sliced bread—at least in the field of quantum gravity.  Everyone would be writing papers about it, because if true it would be revolutionary.   It would overturn calculations by experts which say that a stationary chunk of matter doesn’t emit Hawking radiation.  It would also mean that quantum field theory in curved spacetime can only be consistent if baryon number fails to be conserved!  This would be utterly shocking.</p>
<p>But in fact, these new papers have had almost zero effect on physics.  There’s a short rebuttal, here:</p>
<p>• Antonio Ferreiro José Navarro-Salas and Silvia Pla, <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.229001">Comment on “Gravitational pair production and black hole evaporation”</a>, <i>Phys. Rev. Lett.</i> <b>133</b> (2024), 229001.</p>
<p>It explains that these guys used a crude approximation that gives wrong results even in a simpler problem.   Similar points are made here:</p>
<p>• E. T. Akhmedov, D. V. Diakonov and C. Schubert, <a href="https://link.aps.org/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevD.110.105011">Complex effective actions and gravitational pair creation</a>, <i>Phys. Rev. D.</i> <b>110</b>, 105011.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems the real experts on quantum field theory in curved spacetime have not come out and mentioned the <i>correct</i> way to think about this issue, which has been known at least since 1975.  To them—or maybe I should dare to say “us”—it’s just <em>well known</em> that the gravitational field of a static mass does not cause the creation of particle-antiparticle pairs.</p>
<p>Of course, the referees should have rejected Wondrak, van Suijlekom and Falcke’s papers.  But apparently none of those referees were experts on the subject at hand.  So you can’t trust a paper just because it appears in a supposedly reputable physics journal.  You have to actually understand the subject and assess the paper yourself, or talk to some experts you trust.</p>
<p>If I were a science journalist writing an article about a supposedly shocking development like this, I would email some experts and check to see if it’s for real.  But plenty of science journalists don’t bother with that anymore: they just believe the press releases.  So now we’re being bombarded with lazy articles like these:</p>
<p>• <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/universe-end-much-sooner-than-expected-researchers-say/">Universe will die “much sooner than expected,” new research says</a>, <i>CBS News</i>, May 13, 2025.</p>
<p>• Sharmila Kuthunur, <a href="https://www.space.com/astronomy/scientists-calculate-when-the-universe-will-end-its-sooner-than-expected">Scientists calculate when the universe will end—it’s sooner than expected</a>, <i>Space.com</i>, 15 May 2025.</p>
<p>• Jamie Carter, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2025/05/16/the-universe-will-end-sooner-than-thought-scientists-say/">The universe will end sooner than thought, scientists say</a>, <i>Forbes</i>, 16 May 2025.</p>
<p>The list goes on; these are just three.   There’s no way what I say can have much effect against such a flood of misinformation.  As Mark Twain said, “A lie can travel around the world and back again while the truth is lacing up its boots.”  Actually he probably didn’t say that—but everyone keeps saying he did, illustrating the point perfectly.</p>
<p>Still, there might be a few people who both care and don’t already know this stuff.  Instead of trying to give a mini-course here, let me simply point to an explanation of how things really work:</p>
<p>• Abhay Ashtekar and Anne Magnon, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243683929_Quantum_Fields_in_Curved_Space-Times">Quantum fields in curved space-times</a>, <i>Proceedings of the Royal Society</i>, <b>346</b> (1975), 375–394.</p>
<p>It’s technical, so it’s not easy reading if you haven’t studied quantum field theory and general relativity, but that’s unavoidable.  It shows that in a static spacetime there is a well-defined concept of ‘vacuum’, and the vacuum is stable.  Jorge Pullin pointed out the key sentence for present purposes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Thus, if the underlying space-time admits a everywhere time-like Killing field, the vacuum state is indeed stable and phenomena such as the spontaneous creation of particles do not occur.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This condition of having an “everywhere time-like Killing field” says that a spacetime has time translation symmetry.  Ashtekar and Magnon also assume that spacetime is globally hyperbolic and that the wave equation for a massive spin-zero particle has a smooth solution given smooth initial data.  All this lets us define a concept of energy for solutions of this equation.  It also lets us split solutions into positive-frequency solutions, which correspond to particles, and negative-frequency ones, which correspond to antiparticles.  We can thus set up quantum field theory in way we’re used to on Minkowski spacetime, where there’s a well-defined vacuum which does not decay into particle-antiparticle pairs.</p>
<p>The Schwarzschild solution, which describes a static black hole, also has a Killing field.  But this ceases to be timelike at the event horizon, so this result does not apply to that!</p>
<p>I could go into more detail if required, but you can find a more pedagogical treatment in this standard textbook:</p>
<p>• Robert Wald, <i>Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetime and Black Hole Thermodynamics</i>, University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1994.</p>
<p>In particular, go to Section 4.3, which is on quantum field theory in stationary spacetimes.</p>
<p>I also can’t resist citing this thesis by a student of mine:</p>
<p>• Valeria Michelle Carrión Álvarez, <a href="https://www.arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0412032"><i>Loop Quantization versus Fock Quantization of p-Form Electromagnetism on Static Spacetimes</i></a>, Ph.D. thesis, U. C. Riverside, 2004.</p>
<p>This thesis covers the case of electromagnetism, while Ashtekar and Magnon, and also Wald, focus on a massive scalar field for simplicity.</p>
<p>So: it’s been rigorously shown that the gravitational field of a static object does not create particle-antiparticle pairs.  This has been known for decades.  Now some people have done a crude approximate calculation that seems to show otherwise.  Some flaws in the approximation have been pointed out.  Of course the authors of the calculation <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.133.229002">don’t believe their approximation is flawed</a>.    We could argue about that for a long time.  But it’s scarcely worth thinking about, because no approximations were required to settle this issue.  It was settled over 50 years ago, and the new work is not shedding new light on the issue: it’s much more hand-wavy than the old work.</p>
