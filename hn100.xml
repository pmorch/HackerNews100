<p dir="auto">It's a little ball that lives in your dock. You can drag it and it'll bounce around the screen. You can also swipe on it with two fingers. It comes in red. You can flick it, bounce it, try to make it hit the corner, see how many times it can bounce, count how many times it hits the wall, and more. It's a ball. It's fun. It's a ball.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Download in <a href="https://github.com/nate-parrott/ball/releases">Releases</a></strong></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Credits</h2><a id="user-content-credits" aria-label="Permalink: Credits" href="#credits"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">It's inspired by <a href="https://heagy.com/" rel="nofollow">Nate Heagy's</a> widget for the OS X Dashboard, which I remember fondly because someone put it on our class <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMac" rel="nofollow">eMac</a> in fifth grade. It was a lot bouncier and come in more colors, but it didn't go in the dock!</p>
<p dir="auto">Credit also goes to Wessley Roche, who made this <a href="https://gist.github.com/wonderbit/c8896ff429a858021a7623f312dcdbf9">little Gist</a> explaining how to get the position of the dock. I've <a href="https://github.com/nate-parrott/ball/blob/main/Ball/DockUtils.swift#L65">extended this</a> to try to estimate the position of the app's dock icon when it's clicked, so the ball can animate out of it.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Final words</h2><a id="user-content-final-words" aria-label="Permalink: Final words" href="#final-words"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I hope you enjoy this little ball.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://sansec.io/research/polyfill-supply-chain-attack">https://sansec.io/research/polyfill-supply-chain-attack</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40791829">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Update June 25th</strong>: Google has already started blocking Google Ads for eCommerce sites that use polyfill.io.</p><p>The <code>polyfill.js</code> is a popular open source library to support older browsers. <a href="https://publicwww.com/websites/%22cdn.polyfill.io%22/">100K+ sites</a> embed it using the <code>cdn.polyfill.io</code> domain. Notable users are JSTOR, Intuit and World Economic Forum. However, in February this year, a Chinese company bought the domain and the Github account. Since then, this domain was caught injecting <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240624110153/https://github.com/polyfillpolyfill/polyfill-service/issues/2873">malware</a> on mobile devices via any site that embeds <code>cdn.polyfill.io</code>. Any complaints were quickly removed (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240229113710/https://github.com/polyfillpolyfill/polyfill-service/issues/2834">archive here</a>) from the Github repository.</p><p>The polyfill code is dynamically generated based on the HTTP headers, so multiple attack vectors are likely. Sansec decoded one particular malware (see below) which redirects mobile users to a <a href="https://w9.vty70.net/">sports betting site</a> using a fake Google analytics domain (<code>www.googie-anaiytics.com</code>). The code has specific protection against reverse engineering, and only activates on specific mobile devices at specific hours. It also does not activate when it detects an admin user. It also delays execution when a web analytics service is found, presumably to not end up in the stats.</p><p>The original <a href="https://x.com/triblondon/status/1761852117579427975">polyfill author</a> recommends to not use Polyfill at all, as it is no longer needed by modern browsers anyway. Meanwhile, both <a href="https://community.fastly.com/t/new-options-for-polyfill-io-users/2540">Fastly</a> and <a href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill">Cloudflare</a> have put up trustworthy alternatives, if you still need it.</p><p>This incident is a typical example of a supply chain attack. To get visibility into the code that your users are loading, we recommend our (free) CSP monitoring service <a href="https://sansec.io/watch">Sansec Watch</a>.</p><p>Our <a href="https://sansec.io/#ecomscan">eComscan backend scanner</a> has also been updated with <a href="https://polyfill.io/">polyfill.io</a> detection.</p><h2 id="polyfill-malicious-payload-example" tabindex="-1">Polyfill malicious payload example</h2><p>We added some names for readability, however <code>tiaozhuan</code> came from the original malware (which means "jump" in Chinese).</p><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>isPc</span>(<span></span>) {

Martin Barstow, a professor of astrophysics and space science at the University of Leicester. “Recovering any samples from the moon is difficult, but doing so from the far side, where communications are particularly difficult is a step taken by no other agency. A real technological feat.”</p><p>The US, China and the former Soviet Union have gathered samples from the near side of the moon but China is the first to bring material home from the far side. The intention was to collect up to 2kg of moon rock and soil.</p><p>China previously collaborated with international scientists to study samples it brought back from the near side of the moon but it is unclear whether similar access will be granted to the new material from the far side.</p><p>The latest samples could shed light on longstanding mysteries in the early history of the moon and Earth. Ian Crawford, a professor of planetary science at Birkbeck, University of London, said dating the SPA was a “key objective” of lunar science because it would pin down the timeframe for lunar cratering.</p><p>Understanding the rate at which large asteroids battered the moon in its early history would shed light on the impact history of Earth, he added, as our home planet would be struck by the same kinds of asteroids at the same time. “Constraining this is important for understanding the impact regime under which life first appeared on Earth,” he said.</p><p>The collision that created the SPA basin may have scooped out enough rock to expose areas of the lunar mantle, which researchers believe is crucial to understanding the history, and potentially the origins, of the moon.</p><figure id="e05bd69f-bdb2-48f4-b882-6c605f14ccb2" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:12,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;The new ‘space race’: what are China’s ambitions and why is the US so concerned?&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;e05bd69f-bdb2-48f4-b882-6c605f14ccb2&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/05/the-new-space-race-what-are-chinas-ambitions-and-why-is-the-us-so-concerned&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0,&quot;design&quot;:0}}" config="{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;,&quot;darkModeAvailable&quot;:false,&quot;updateLogoAdPartnerSwitch&quot;:true,&quot;assetOrigin&quot;:&quot;https://assets.guim.co.uk/&quot;}"></gu-island></figure><p>“It is possible that the SPA has excavated deep enough to expose the lunar mantle, and possible that fragments might be found in the Chang’e-6 samples,” Crawford said. “It’s long shot but it’s worth looking.”</p><p>The far side of the moon has fewer ancient lava plains or maria, a thicker crust, and because it is not shielded by Earth, sports more craters from violent impacts.</p><p>“Recovering samples from the far side is tremendously exciting scientifically, as we only have very limited information on the geology there,” Barstow said. “It has been processed very differently to the side of the moon facing us, which has been extensively resurfaced by volcanic activity in the past, creating the maria from which most samples have been obtained.”</p><p>China has more lunar missions planned this decade. They are intended to pave the way for an International Lunar Research base, which it will co-lead with Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, and the eventual landing of a Chinese astronaut on the moon.</p><p>Dr Simeon Barber, a senior research fellow at the Open University, said: “We’re entering a new era of discovery, and getting samples returned from the far side is a milestone achievement that will help us understand the geological history in that region, and why it differs so markedly from the more familiar near side.</p><p>“Specialised laboratories around the world have spent five decades finessing the analytical techniques to tease out the moon’s secrets from within near side samples returned by the Apollo and Luna missions. And now we are on the cusp of applying all that expertise to learn about the enigmatic far side of our nearest neighbour in space.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">Glasskube is an <strong>Open Source package manager for Kubernetes</strong>.
It makes deploying, updating, and configuring packages on Kubernetes <strong>20 times faster</strong> than tools like <strong>Helm or Kustomize</strong>.
Inspired by the simplicity of Homebrew and npm. You can decide if you want to use the Glasskube UI, CLI, or directly deploy packages via GitOps.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">⭐️ Why Glasskube?</h2><a id="user-content-️-why-glasskube" aria-label="Permalink: ⭐️ Why Glasskube?" href="#️-why-glasskube"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We have been working in the Kubernetes ecosystem for over five years.
During this time, we have consistently struggled with package management, configuration, and distribution.
We've spent countless hours templating and writing documentation for commands and concepts that were difficult to grasp.</p>
<p dir="auto">In contrast, tools like Homebrew, apt, and dnf felt easy to use and rarely caused problems.
While we worked on other cloud-native projects, our users consistently highlighted several common pain points.
This realization prompted us to tackle the larger issue of package management in Kubernetes, leading to the development of Glasskube.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://flipdisc.io/">https://flipdisc.io/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40789672">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  
<p><strong>Flipdiscs</strong> (or <em>flip dots</em>) are a display type that utilizes electromagnetic pulses to flip a small disc between two colors. Despite being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-disc_display#History">invented over 80 years ago</a>, the underlying technology is mostly the same today. I chose them because I wanted to design a large interactive wall art for my office, and didn’t like the LED glow of traditional screens. Flip displays are an interesting alternative. They have no moving parts, near limitless lifespan, high readability, and achieves anywhere between 25-60fps. Also, as a pleasant bonus, they emit a sound like rain hitting a window each time one of the disc flips - I find it very soothing. I’ve always wanted unique ways to visualize code, like this <a href="https://github.com/kelly/electroknit-app">pixel knitting app</a> we designed for <a href="https://beckystern.com/2010/11/02/hacking-the-brother-kh-930e-knitting-machine/">electroknit knitting machines</a> or this <a href="https://github.com/simpsoka/atom-crafts">crafting tool</a> for Atom Editor (RIP). Flipdots seemed like a similar fun challenge. I paired with my <a href="https://github.com/kelly">partner</a> to help code and design the board. Who doesn’t love quality hacking time with their partner?! I’m not sure how many people will find this useful since flipdisc displays are sort of an obscure technology, but here we go!</p>

<h3 id="panels">Panels</h3>
<p>We used 9 <a href="https://flipdots.com/en/products-services/flip-dot-boards-xy5/">Alfazeta panels</a> in a 3x3 grid or 84x42 discs. Each board has (2) 28x7 panels. You can see the measurments of the toal design in this diagram. The PCB features an older <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/atmega128">ATMEGA128 microcontroller</a>, a couple hundred MELF diodes (be sure to <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/vishay-general-semiconductor-diodes-division/LL4148-GS08/3104225">buy extras</a>, because they can pop off easily!) charlieplexed together, and two DIP switches. One DIP switch sets the address, and the other sets the baud rate. Find more information about the AlfaZeta boards, here is the <a href="https://github.com/chrishemmings/flipPyDot/blob/master/resources/14x28_7x28_FLIPDOTS%20Sign%20REV9%20-%20Manual.pdf">manual</a>.</p>
<p>It’s relatively difficult to source flipdisc boards or components, so your options are limited. If I were to do the project again, I would consider experimenting with designing my own board or one like <a href="https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/15mm8-8-ledmechanical-interactive-device-flip_1600972947222.html">this design</a> which has a more modular arrangement and custom disc colors. These <a href="https://flipdots.com/en/products-services/small-7-segment-displays/">7-segment flipdiscs</a> also look really neat. Having access to the firmware would be a nice option when tuning performance. I also really wish I could’ve gone larger, but the expense of the panels really adds up fast. Unfortunately, right now, flipdiscs are more catered towards businesses (mostly the transportation industry) than the general consumer. Hopefully that changes.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="power">Power</h3>
<p>To power the board, it needs a total 24V 1A per board, or 9A total to send enough power to flip all the dots. We ended up using a 24V 10A Meanwell power supply. <a href="https://www.jameco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10001&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=10001&amp;productId=2115039">MEAN WELL HLG-240H-24</a></p>
<h3 id="frame">Frame</h3>
<p>We built the frame using <a href="https://8020.net/">80/20 aluminum extrusions</a>, and screwed the PCB standoffs directly onto the frame. Word of caution: the boards and discs are incredibly fragile (My kids love to mess with them!) I read somewhere that flipdiscs are similar to butterfly wings, and I think that’s an appropriate analogy. It’s really easy to lose or break discs in the building process. Make sure to handle by the edges and carefully attach each board one-at-a-time. Here is a list of 80/20 parts that we purchased:</p>
<ul>
<li>(7) <a href="https://8020.net/1010.html">1010</a> - cut to 25.2in</li>
<li>(2) <a href="https://8020.net/1010.html">1010</a> - cut to 49.65in</li>
<li>(12) <a href="https://8020.net/33460.html">33460</a> Corner Connector</li>
<li>(72) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KRRG8HT">M3x16MM screws</a></li>
<li>(72) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BLSRZYJ">M3x10MM spacer</a></li>
</ul>
<p>80/20 is really easy to assemble. I would also recommend the <a href="https://8020.net/6120.html">10-series jig</a> and <a href="https://8020.net/6115.html">bit</a> for drilling mounting holes. We also built a wood frame out of birch. You could easily skip this part and just mount the 80/20 frame. Woodworking is beyond the scope of this article. Here are some <a href="https://flipdisc.io/photos">photos of the final build</a>.</p>

<h3 id="cabling">Cabling</h3>
<p>We connected each column in series, and then chained them all together. The data lines are +/- on the RS485 block terminal. We used 18AWG wire for the power lines and 22 AWG shielded cable for the data. It’s helpful to have some <a href="https://www.wago.com/us/discover-wire-and-splicing-connectors">Wago Wire Lever Nuts</a> for splicing and crimping terminals for the wire ends. If you want to achieve high framerates, make sure you’re using an RS485 line for no more than 6 panels. We used a total of 3 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Serial-Converter-Adapter-Supports-Windows/dp/B076WVFXN8/">USB RS485 devices</a> for the display. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/USR-Usr-Tcp232-410S-Ethernet-Adapter-Converter/dp/B07C1TC165/">RS485 to ethernet servers</a> are also great if you want to serve the content from an external server.</p>

<p>Depending on the type of board that you get, here are some tools and parts that I recommend:</p>
<ul>
<li>(18) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077979RZR/">5.08mm Pitch Male Female PCB Screw Terminal Block</a></li>
<li>(4) <a href="https://www.wago.com/us/discover-wire-and-splicing-connectors/221">Wago 221 Wire Lever Nuts</a></li>
<li>(72) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07R6QQ7MW/">Wire Ferrules</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09Q5DZSHF/">Ferrule Crimping Tool</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CXKOEQ6/">Wire stripper</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="processing">Processing</h3>
<p>We’re using machine learning for processing voice, video, and images so needed a little bit more processing power than a basic single-board computer or microcontroller. We ended up using a <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-orin-nano-devkit">Nvidia Orin Nano</a>. A <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/">Raspberry Pi</a> would likely work too, although the framerate may start to suffer. We paired the Nvidia board with an <a href="https://www.mouser.com/new/raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-camera-module-3/?utm_id=19995600859&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw34qzBhBmEiwAOUQcFzi5DFHjEAI-fjmMZzRsJUR99gucgTf0dsMneAacyxRx6YVRJt8PLRoCegkQAvD_BwE">IMX708 camera</a> and a <a href="https://www.waveshare.com/audio-card-for-jetson-nano.htm">Waveshare audio board</a> for audio input/output. We created a <a href="https://github.com/simpsoka/office-flipdisc/blob/main/Dockerfile">Dockerfile</a> for deploying on <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack-sdk-60dp">Jetson 6.0</a>. Mediapipe has to be compiled from source to enable the GPU. If you’re looking for an easier route, I would recommend a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Desktop-Computer-10%E2%80%91core-Ethernet/dp/B0BSHGHGXR">M2 Mac Mini</a>, or if you want to skip the interaction you can go with a much more inexpensive solution, like a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/">Raspberry Pi</a>.</p>

<h3 id="board">Board</h3>
<div><p><span>Frame Format</span></p><p><span>0x80</span><span>0x83</span><span>0x01</span><span>imageData</span><span>0x8F</span></p></div>
<p>Communication is over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-485">RS485</a>. Each frame starts with a start byte [0x80], followed by either flush [0x83] or buffer [0x84], then the address of your board, then your image data, finally followed by an end byte [0x8F]. Image data is really easy since we only have two states [0, 1]. It also uses RLE for compressing each frame it sends over the wire. We created a basic library for using flipdisc screens in Node.js. It currently works with AlfaZeta and Hanover boards over USB and ethernet. <a href="https://github.com/kelly/flipdisc">Github</a>. You can send data directly from a canvas instance using ctx.getImageData(0, 0, width, height), and it’ll cast the pixel data to either 1 or 0 based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminance">luminance</a>. Here is an example of how it works:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="js"><code><span><span>import</span><span> { createDisplay } </span><span>from</span><span> 'flipdisc'</span><span> </span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> path </span><span>=</span><span> '/dev/tty0'</span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> display </span><span>=</span><span> createDisplay</span><span>([[</span><span>1</span><span>], [</span><span>2</span><span>]], path) </span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>display.</span><span>send</span><span>(frameData)</span></span>
<span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p><a href="https://flipdisc.io/docs">Driver Documentation</a></p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span><span>npm install flipdisc</span></span>
<span><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>We wanted to build something that could run real-time visualations with direct user feedback. This is unlike other low-pixel displays that pre-render assets to display on low-powered devices e.g. <a href="https://github.com/tidbyt/pixlet">Pixlet</a> from <a href="https://tidbyt.com/">tidbyt</a>. We knew we wanted to utilize webgl/canvas. There was no reason to re-invent the wheel with rendering libraries, so we’re leveraging existing web tech that we’ve found to work well - <a href="https://pixijs.com/">PIXI</a> for general 2D rendering, <a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a> for 3D rendering, <a href="https://brm.io/matter-js/%5B">Matter.js</a> for physics engine, and <a href="https://gsap.com/core/">GSAP</a> for animations. We also utilize node-canvas, and node-gl for server-side rendering.</p>
<p>For interactions, we’re using Google’s fantastic <a href="https://mediapipe-studio.webapps.google.com/home">MediaPipe libraries</a> and models. For a quick demo, check of their <a href="https://mediapipe-studio.webapps.google.com/studio/demo/gesture_recognizer">example of Gesture Recognizing</a>. Since many ML libraries use python, we spawn python scripts from node to run most of the ML specific code, and then send the data back via <a href="https://zeromq.org/">ZeroMQ</a> IPC. Maybe we’ll use <a href="https://wasmer.io/posts/py2wasm-a-python-to-wasm-compiler">Python WASM</a> in the future.</p>
<p>Here is an example of using the Gesture Recognizer in this project:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="js"><code><span><span>  const</span><span> e </span><span>=</span><span> new</span><span> GestureEmitter</span><span>()</span></span>
<span><span>  scene.</span><span>add</span><span>(e)</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>  e.</span><span>on</span><span>(</span><span>'move'</span><span>, data </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>    if</span><span> (data.gesture[</span><span>0</span><span>] </span><span>==</span><span> 'Open_Palm'</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>      ball.position </span><span>=</span><span> data.position;</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span><span>  })</span></span>
<span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>We created many different visualisations that can be toggled and customized on-demand. Each of these visualizations is represented as a scene and can be added to a queue. Playing a scene or managing the queue is accessible by a REST API. The live playing data is sent over websockets. Building a scene is straightforward. You can subscribe to events or add to the rendering queue with the <a href="https://flipdot.io/docs/server/#rendering">useLoop function</a>. Each scene file has to return both a scene and a schema and, optionally, a background task. A background task will run at a set interval, and if it returns successfully it’ll add a scene to the queue to play.</p>
<p><a href="https://flipdisc.io/docs/server">Server Documentation</a> | <a href="https://github.com/simpsoka/office-flipdisc/tree/main/scenes">Scene Examples</a></p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span><span>npm install flipdisc-server</span></span>
<span><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>Here is an example of a basic scene that shows an image.</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="js"><code><span><span>import</span><span> { createScene, ImageView } </span><span>from</span><span> 'flipdisc-server'</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> schema </span><span>=</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>  title: </span><span>'Image'</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  properties: {</span></span>
<span><span>    url: {</span></span>
<span><span>      type: </span><span>'string'</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>      default: </span><span>'image.png'</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    },</span></span>
<span><span>  }</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> image</span><span> =</span><span> function</span><span>(opts) {</span></span>
<span><span>  const</span><span> scene </span><span>=</span><span> createScene</span><span>()</span></span>
<span><span>  scene.</span><span>once</span><span>(</span><span>'loaded'</span><span>, () </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>    const</span><span> img </span><span>=</span><span> new</span><span> ImageView</span><span>(opts.url)</span></span>
<span><span>    scene.</span><span>add</span><span>(img)</span></span>
<span><span>  })</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>  return</span><span> scene;</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>export</span><span> { image </span><span>as</span><span> scene, schema }</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>Here is a bit more of what the library helps take care of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A way to import scenes from a directory</li>
<li>Live reload on scene files</li>
<li>Background tasks that add a scene to the queue</li>
<li>Easy UI components for text, images, lists, etc</li>
<li>Flex layout based on <a href="https://github.com/facebook/yoga">Yoga</a>.</li>
<li>Basic getters and setup for pixi/three/matter as well as ability to add additional modules</li>
<li>REST server and websocket for live data</li>
<li>Easy way to use rendering loops, or GLSL shaders</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="interface">Interface</h3>
<p>I’ve built many projects in the past that become unusable because I no longer remember which command to run, or how to operate it. So, we wanted to make sure to build a reliable interface for the display. We settled on an <a href="https://expo.dev/">expo</a> app since it was the quickest way to prototype. As much as I love native apps, I cringe whenever I have to open Xcode. You can control all aspects of the display from the app - pause, start, skip, previous. You can configure scene variables to personalize the experience. You can also freehand draw right on the screen. Download it on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/flipdisc/id6504055618">App Store</a>. Here are some screenshots from the app:</p>

<p>A few of the features are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pause/play a scene</li>
<li>Add or remove from queue</li>
<li>Skip or previous in queue</li>
<li>Watch live screen of what’s being shown on display</li>
<li>Freehand draw on screen</li>
<li>Send configuration variables to each scene</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubSpace_(video_game)">Subspace</a> was one of the first multiplayer games I played as a kid. The game allowed you to have a tiny 12x8 banner that you could design that would appear right next to your ship. I was blown away by what people could create with such limited space. I was soon hooked on designing my own. There was something about the strict limitation of pixels that lent itself to pushing creativity even further - you wanted to see how far you could push the medium. It’s easy to take for granted the sheer number of pixels we have at our disposal when working on the web. Being forced to distill things into the simplest information that you can convey is sometimes a blessing because you have to be very conscious and deliberate with the decisions you make. The 42x84 size of the flipdisc display felt like a similar exercise in constraints.</p>
<p>The basic readable font that we use is a tiny <a href="https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/1404171/cg-pixel-3x5">3x5 pixel font</a>. There is also <a href="https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/1404171/cg-pixel-4x5">4x5</a> and <a href="https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/1404346/cg-pixel-4x5-2-1">mono</a> variants. If you want to go even smaller, there are <a href="https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/670512/tiny3x3a">3x3 fonts</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Michaelangel007/nanofont3x4">3x4 nano fonts</a>, but I feel like they lose too much legibility to be usable in practice. Anything over 12 pixels you can use most fonts with maintaining some legibility. Bitmap fonts are really great for these types of displays - especially since any anti-aliasing isn’t rendered. There are some really interesting <a href="https://github.com/ianhan/BitmapFonts">archives of Bitmap designed fonts</a> that could be fun to integrate.</p>
<astro-island uid="1BVe6Y" component-url="/_astro/FontExperimenter.DqyUpPRB.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.E677JtKR.js" props="{}" ssr="" client="only" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;FontExperimenter&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;react&quot;}"></astro-island>
<p>For images, we use a mixture of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Steinberg_dithering">Floyd-Steinberg dithering</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_dithering">Bayer 4x4 ordered dithering</a>. Below is an example that shows the difference in the two techniques. I prefer Floyd-Steinberg on images since it has a more natural pixel distribution, and Bayer on UI elements since it produces a consistent pattern. If you’re curious to learn more, here is a fantastic article on the subject - <a href="https://surma.dev/things/ditherpunk/">Ditherpunk — The article I wish I had about monochrome image dithering</a></p>
<astro-island uid="1U0Tog" component-url="/_astro/DitherExample.Dgek1gIL.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.E677JtKR.js" props="{}" ssr="" client="only" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;DitherExample&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;react&quot;}"></astro-island>
<p>Finally, below are some of the scenes that we designed for my office. They include a <a href="https://github.com/simpsoka/office-flipdisc/blob/main/scenes/feed.js">New York Times RSS reader</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/simpsoka/office-flipdisc/blob/main/scenes/spotify.js">Spotify client</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/simpsoka/office-flipdisc/blob/main/scenes/weather.js">weather app</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/simpsoka/office-flipdisc/tree/main/scenes">many more</a>. We’ll probably expand on this list as I figure out which stuff I want to casually glance at as I work.</p>
<astro-island uid="15UJ8y" component-url="/_astro/Scenes.D97-rpHx.js" component-export="default" renderer-url="/_astro/client.E677JtKR.js" props="{}" ssr="" client="only" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Scenes&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;react&quot;}"></astro-island>
<h2 id="next-steps-ai-wall">Next Steps: AI Wall</h2>
<p>Our goal is to make a transparent agent interface to AI utilizing new multi-modal input/output. Since a lot of these capabilities are right around the corner, we’re waiting on next-gen models to be released before pursusing this functionality.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I really had a fun time colaborating on this project. I do hope that flipdiscs become more accessible for hobbyists. If anyone wants to collaborate on new affordable flipdisc hardware, let me know! And, if you have any questions about how to build your own feel free to <a href="https://flipdisc.io/contact">reach out</a>.</p>

<p>The wait is over. Starting today, anyone can hail a ride with Waymo in San Francisco. Rain, shine, or Karl the Fog, just <a href="http://waymo.com/app"><u>download the app</u></a>, and ride.</p>
<p>We’ve been operating in San Francisco for years now, deliberately scaling our service over time. With tens of thousands of weekly trips, our Waymo One service provides safe, sustainable, and reliable transportation to locals and visitors to the city alike.</p>
<p>Now it’s available to anyone.</p>
<h4><b>Waymo rides for all, 24/7, across the city</b></h4>
<figure><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pE9DF5_k3ZY" loading="lazy" allowfullscreen="" height="400" width="400"></iframe></figure>
<p>San Franciscans are using Waymo to connect to the city’s social fabric, making fully autonomous rides part of their daily lives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>About 30% of Waymo rides in San Francisco are to local businesses. We’ve provided thousands of rides to and from individual restaurants, live music venues, bars, coffee shops, ice cream parlors, parks, and museums, boosting the local economy. In a recent survey, over half of our riders said they used Waymo in the past couple of months to or from medical appointments, highlighting the value of personal space during these trips. Additionally, 36% of our SF riders used Waymo to connect to other forms of transit, like BART or Muni. Some of our San Francisco riders even use Waymo to depart in style from their <a href="https://twitter.com/Jovanthienen/status/1762870287681687678"><u>weddings</u></a>.</p>
<p>“I'm thankful to be living in a city that embraces technology when it can improve our lives with convenient and safe modes of transit,” says Michelle Cusano, Executive Director at The Richmond Neighborhood Center.</p>
<p>Waymo’s fleet is all-electric and sources 100% renewable energy from the City’s <a href="https://www.cleanpowersf.org/supergreenspotlight"><u>CleanPowerSF program</u></a>. Since the beginning of our commercial operations in August 2023, Waymo’s rides have helped curb carbon <a href="http://waymo.com/waymo-avoided-emissions-methodology"><u>emissions by an estimated 570,000 kg</u></a>, contributing to California’s ride hail emissions goals. This also empowers our riders to travel more sustainably — Waymo’s recent rider survey revealed that 53% of our San Francisco users feel that Waymo has helped them be more environmentally friendly.</p>
<p>Plus, more than half of Waymo riders in SF say that riding with Waymo has improved their sense of personal safety when getting around, according to the survey.</p>
<p>“I enjoy riding in Waymo cars and appreciate the ease of transportation,” says Charles Renfroe, Development Manager at Openhouse SF. “Members of our community, especially transgender and gender non-conforming folks, don’t have to worry about being verbally assaulted or discriminated against when riding with Waymo.”</p>
<p>In addition to improving mobility for locals, Waymo offers a unique way for visitors to experience the city. Thousands of tourists have enjoyed the sightseeing from Waymo vehicles, exploring San Francisco’s iconic landmarks from the Presidio to the Ferry Building. By supporting Spanish and Chinese languages through our app and in-car features, we ensure a more inclusive experience for a diverse group of local riders and visitors to the City by the Bay alike.</p>
<p>In total, nearly 300,000 people, including those who live, work, and visit San Francisco, have signed up to ride with Waymo since we first opened a waitlist —&nbsp;more than a quarter of the city’s population. We’ve been welcoming new riders to the service incrementally, and we are now excited to open it up to everyone.</p>
<h4><b>Scaling our operations safely and responsibly</b></h4>
<p>Safety leads everything we do at Waymo, and this step in our journey builds on over 15 years of experience building safe and convenient autonomous driving, ever since we took our first rides on the streets of Palo Alto back in 2009. With more than 20 million rider-only miles and nearly 2 million paid rider-only public trips under our belt, we’re now bringing the safety benefits of the Waymo Driver to more people in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Road safety is urgent. Thirty nine people were killed on San Francisco’s roads in 2022 and twenty five more in 2023, with thousands reporting injuries every year. Traffic violence kills around 40,000 people in the U.S. annually. The status quo on road safety doesn't serve the people of San Francisco, and the Waymo Driver can help change that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Drunk driving remains the leading cause of fatalities and injuries on American roads, claiming over 13,000 lives in 2021 alone. As drivers increasingly drive while impaired, the need for technological intervention becomes evident,” — says Patricia Rillera, Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) California State Executive Director. “MADD proudly collaborates with autonomous vehicle leaders like Waymo, recognizing their potential to prevent tragedies caused by impaired, distracted, and drowsy driving."</p>
<p>Our track record for safe operations is unparalleled. We’ve been safely transporting passengers for over six years, now providing more than 50,000 rides a week across three major urban areas. Over more than 30 scientific papers, it’s become clear that the Waymo Driver is <a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2023/07/the-waymo-driver-is-already-improving-road-safety/"><u>already</u></a> improving road safety in the cities where we operate. The Waymo Driver <a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2022/09/benchmarking-av-safety/"><u>avoids high-severity collisions</u></a> better than even the most attentive human drivers, and the data shows that we have fewer <a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2023/09/waymos-autonomous-vehicles-are-significantly-safer-than-human-driven-ones/"><u>insurance claims</u></a> and <a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2023/12/waymo-significantly-outperforms-comparable-human-benchmarks-over-7-million/"><u>injuries or police reports</u></a> than human drivers.</p>

<p>Our operations improve safety for other road users, too. Over the 3.8+ million rider-only miles we’ve driven in San Francisco through the end of March, the Waymo Driver was involved in 17 fewer crashes with injuries and 12 fewer police-reportable crashes compared to human drivers*.</p>
<p>We’re committed to growing our service gradually and responsibly. We work closely with city and state officials, first responders, and advocates for road safety to ensure our service helps local communities gain access to reliable, safe, environmentally friendly transportation and has a positive impact on mobility.</p>
<p>A huge thanks to our many riders, community partners, and the residents of San Francisco for their support on this journey. Together, we’re providing locals and visitors to San Francisco with a safe, clean and fun mobility experience, keeping the city on the forefront of technological innovation.</p>
<p>And if you’d like to experience full autonomy for yourself, download the Waymo One app on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/waymo-one/id1343524838"><u>App Store</u></a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.waymo.carapp&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1"><u>Google Play</u></a> and take a ride today.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    

    <div>
      <p>The day after July 4th 🇺🇸, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv/commit/71dabbf27b699fcb7a04714709cecfc6e78892b9">dotenv’s first commit</a> and released <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv/v/0.0.1">version 0.0.1 on npm</a>. It looked like this.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/dotenvx/dotenvx/assets/3848/632a3bf4-50f4-4614-a0c2-12b2f6e64ccc" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>In the 11 years since, it’s become one of the <a href="https://gist.github.com/anvaka/8e8fa57c7ee1350e3491#top-1000-most-depended-upon-packages">most depended-upon packages</a> worldwide 🌎 – adjacent ubiquitous software like TypeScript and ESLint.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/dotenvx/dotenvx/assets/3848/3b93fa70-8204-4563-b5b5-a3a2dcfb3de3" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>It’s an example of “big things have small beginnings”. The <a href="https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv/commit/71dabbf27b699fcb7a04714709cecfc6e78892b9#diff-b335630551682c19a781afebcf4d07bf978fb1f8ac04c6bf87428ed5106870f5">README</a> was short and the <a href="https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv/commit/71dabbf27b699fcb7a04714709cecfc6e78892b9#diff-7934bf411fea192ad8cd69e0a12911648a2842cb0f2409a8fb67b41b7069d757">code was humble</a>, but today it’s beloved by millions of developers.</p>

<p>It’s one of the few security tools that improve your security posture with minimal fuss.</p>

<ul>
  <li>a single line of code - <code>require('dotenv').config()</code>
</li>
  <li>a single file - <code>.env</code>
</li>
  <li>a single gitignore append - <code>echo '.env' &gt; .gitignore</code>
</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s aesthetic, it’s effective, it’s elegant.</p>

<p><strong>But it’s not without its problems!</strong> And that’s what I want to talk about.</p>

<h2 id="the-problems-with-dotenv">The problems with <code>dotenv</code>
</h2>

<p>In order of importance, there are three big problems with <code>dotenv</code>:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>leaking your .env file</em></li>
  <li><em>juggling multiple environments</em></li>
  <li><em>inconsistency across platforms</em></li>
</ol>

<p>All three pose risks to security, and the first does SIGNIFICANTLY.</p>

<p><strong>But I think we have a solution to all three today - with <a href="https://github.com/dotenvx/dotenvx">dotenvx</a></strong>. In reverse problem order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="https://github.com/dotenvx/dotenvx?tab=readme-ov-file#run-anywhere">Run Anywhere</a> -&gt; <em>inconsistency across platforms</em>
</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://github.com/dotenvx/dotenvx?tab=readme-ov-file#multiple-environments">Multiple Environments</a> -&gt; <em>juggling multiple environments</em>
</li>
  <li>
<a href="https://github.com/dotenvx/dotenvx?tab=readme-ov-file#encryption">Encryption</a> -&gt; <em>leaking your .env file</em>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s dig into each. I’ll do my best to show rather than tell.</p>

<h2 id="run-anywhere">Run Anywhere</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dotenvx/dotenvx">dotenvx</a> works the same across every language, framework, and platform – inject your env at runtime with <code>dotenvx run -- your-cmd</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$ echo "HELLO=World" &gt; .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" &gt; index.js

$ node index.js
Hello undefined # without dotenvx

$ dotenvx run -- node index.js
Hello World # with dotenvx
&gt; :-D
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/dotenvx/dotenvx/blob/6f5a91370437716c93ead3e4400d1ee46e2b77ef/src/lib/helpers/parseDecryptEvalExpand.js#L6">.env parsing engine</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dotenvx/dotenvx?tab=readme-ov-file#run-anywhere">variable expansion</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dotenvx/dotenvx?tab=readme-ov-file#run-anywhere">command substitution</a>, and more work exactly the same. Install dotenvx via <a href="https://dotenvx.com/docs/install#npm">npm</a>, <a href="https://dotenvx.com/docs/install#brew">brew</a>, <a href="https://dotenvx.com/docs/install#shell">curl</a>, <a href="https://dotenvx.com/docs/install#docker">docker</a>, <a href="https://docs/install#windows">windows</a>, and <a href="https://dotenvx.com/docs/install">more</a>.</p>

<p>This solves the problem of <em>inconsistency across platforms</em>. ✅ You’ll get the exact same behavior for your <a href="https://dotenvx.com/docs/guides#python">python apps</a> as your <a href="https://dotenvx.com/docs/guides#node-js">node apps</a> as your <a href="https://dotenvx.com/docs/guides#go">rust apps</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dotenvx/dotenvx?tab=readme-ov-file#run-anywhere"><img src="https://github.com/dotenvx/dotenvx/assets/3848/6a43eb52-4b1d-48c2-8c7a-b62cb35b526b" loading="lazy"></a></p>

<h2 id="multiple-environments">Multiple Environments</h2>

<p>Create a <code>.env.production</code> file and use <code>-f</code> to load it. It’s straightforward, yet flexible.</p>

<pre><code>$ echo "HELLO=production" &gt; .env.production
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" &gt; index.js

$ dotenvx run -f .env.production -- node index.js
[dotenvx][info] loading env (1) from .env.production
Hello production
&gt; ^^
</code></pre>

<p>While everything in <a href="https://github.com/dotenvx/dotenvx">dotenvx</a> is inspired by community suggestions, this multi-environment feature particularly is. There were suggestions many times for something similar before I came to understand its usefulness. I’m convinvced now it cleanly solves the problem of <em>juggling multiple environments</em> when built into the command line. ✅</p>

<p>You can even compose multiple environments together with multiple <code>-f</code> flags.</p>

<pre><code>$ echo "HELLO=local" &gt; .env.local
$ echo "HELLO=World" &gt; .env
$ echo "console.log('Hello ' + process.env.HELLO)" &gt; index.js

$ dotenvx run -f .env.local -f .env -- node index.js
[dotenvx] injecting env (1) from .env.local, .env
Hello local
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dotenvx/dotenvx?tab=readme-ov-file#multiple-environments"><img src="https://github.com/dotenvx/dotenvx/assets/3848/8983a359-32f9-459a-861c-66bfdf4e87a1" loading="lazy"></a></p>

<p>Handy! But it’s the next feature, <strong>encryption</strong>, that is the real game changer (and I think merits dotenvx as the <em>next generation of configuration management</em>).</p>

<h2 id="encryption">Encryption</h2>

<p>Add encryption to your .env files with a single command. Run <code>dotenvx encrypt</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$ dotenvx encrypt
✔ encrypted (.env)
</code></pre>

<pre><code>#/-------------------[DOTENV_PUBLIC_KEY]--------------------/
#/            public-key encryption for .env files          /

</code></pre>

<p>A <code>DOTENV_PUBLIC_KEY</code> (encryption key) and a <code>DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY</code> (decryption key) are generated using the same public-key cryptography as <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1">Bitcoin</a>.</p>

<p>Now, even if you leak your .env file, it’s ok. An attacker needs the <code>DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY</code> to make sense of things. This effectively solves the problem of <em>leaking your .env file</em> ✅.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dotenvx/dotenvx?tab=readme-ov-file#encryption"><img src="https://github.com/dotenvx/dotenvx/assets/3848/42aef834-50d9-4187-93e4-b5230ae1253a" loading="lazy"></a></p>

<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> This approach additionally makes it possible for contributors to add config while simultaneously being unable to decrypt config. I anticipate this will be useful for open source projects where you want to allow for contribution of secrets without decryption of prior secrets.</p>

<h2 id="100-release">1.0.0 Release</h2>

<p>With that, we’re pleased to announce the release of <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dotenvx/dotenvx">dotenvx version 1.0.0</a> 🎉.</p>

<p>It is the <em>next generation of configuration management</em>, and I’m looking forward to what you do with it. The next decade (like the last) is bright for dotenv! 🌟</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EU regulators have charged Microsoft with illegally bundling its Teams chat app with its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 subscriptions. It’s the first time Microsoft has been charged with antitrust violations in the EU for 15 years, following two big cases related to Windows Media Player and Internet Explorer bundling.</p><p>“The European Commission has informed Microsoft of its preliminary view that Microsoft has breached EU antitrust rules by tying its communication and collaboration product Teams to its popular productivity applications included in its suites for businesses Office 365 and Microsoft 365,” says the European Commission in a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_3446">statement today</a>.</p><p>Microsoft has now been handed a statement of objections, a list of the EU’s concerns over its Teams bundling. The software giant <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/31/23853517/microsoft-teams-unbundling-europe">unbundled Teams from Office</a> in Europe last year in an attempt to address regulator concerns, and then <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/1/24117785/microsoft-teams-office-split-eu-regulation-antitrust-investigation">spun off Teams from Office 365</a> as its own separate app globally. The unbundling hasn’t been enough to prevent charges, though.</p><p>“We are concerned that Microsoft may be giving its own communication product Teams an undue advantage over competitors, by tying it to its popular productivity suites for businesses,” says Margrethe Vestager, the head of competition policy in Europe. “If confirmed, Microsoft’s conduct would be illegal under our competition rules. Microsoft now has the opportunity to reply to our concerns.”</p><p>Microsoft says it is working with the EU to find solutions. “Having unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today and will work to find solutions to address the Commission’s remaining concerns,” says Microsoft president Brad Smith in a statement to the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/eb83bb45-84b3-4c58-9589-684029d23243"><em>Financial Times</em></a>.</p><p>EU lawmakers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/27/23797305/microsoft-teams-eu-antitrust-investigation-office-bundling-slack">first opened</a> a Microsoft antitrust investigation into Teams bundling last year, following an anti-competitive complaint filed by Slack in July 2020. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21333989/slack-microsoft-eu-competition-complaint-teams-office">Slack’s original complaint</a>&nbsp;alleged that Microsoft had “illegally tied” its Microsoft Teams product to Office and is “force installing it for millions, blocking its removal, and hiding the true cost to enterprise customers.”</p><p>If Microsoft is found guilty of antitrust violations, the firm could face a fine of up to 10 percent of the company’s annual worldwide turnover. The European Commission could also impose remedies to force Microsoft to change its software products, much like it has in the past.</p><p>In 2004 the European Commission ordered Microsoft to offer a version of Windows without Media Player bundled, which resulted in a Windows XP N version available only in EU markets. In 2009 Microsoft was also forced to implement a browser ballot box in its Windows operating system to ensure users were presented with a choice of web browsers, after years of Microsoft bunding Internet Explorer with Windows. Microsoft was then <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/6/4069126/eu-fines-microsoft-for-windows-7-sp1-browser-ballot">fined $730 million</a>&nbsp;in 2013 for failing to include the browser ballot in Windows 7 SP1.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Large language models such as ChaptGPT have proven to be able to produce remarkably intelligent results, but the energy and monetary costs associated with running these massive algorithms is sky high. It costs $700,000 per day in energy costs to run ChatGPT 3.5, according to recent estimates, and leaves behind a massive carbon footprint in the process.</p><p>In a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02528">new preprint paper</a>, researchers from UC Santa Cruz show that it is possible to eliminate the most computationally expensive element of running large language models, called matrix multiplication, while maintaining performance. In getting rid of matrix multiplication and running their algorithm on custom hardware, the researchers found that they could power a billion-parameter-scale language model on just 13 watts, about equal to the energy of powering a lightbulb and more than 50 times more efficient than typical hardware.&nbsp;</p><p>Even with a slimmed-down algorithm and much less energy consumption, the new, open source model achieves the same performance as state-of-the-art models like Meta’s Llama.</p><p>“We got the same performance at way less cost — all we had to do was fundamentally change how neural networks work,” said Jason Eshraghian, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at the Baskin School of Engineering and the paper’s lead author. “Then we took it a step further and built custom hardware.”</p><p><strong>Understanding the cost&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Until now, all modern neural networks, the algorithms that power large language models, have used a technique called matrix multiplication. In large language models, words are represented as numbers that are then organized into matrices. Matrices are multiplied by each other to produce language, performing operations that weigh the importance of particular words or highlight relationships between words in a sentence or sentences in a paragraph. Larger scale language models have trillions of these numbers.&nbsp;</p><p>“Neural networks, in a way, are glorified matrix multiplication machines,” Eshraghian said. “The larger your matrix, the more things your neural network can learn.”&nbsp;</p><p>For the algorithms to be able to multiply matrices together, the matrices need to be stored somewhere, and then fetched when it comes time to compute. This is solved by storing the matrices on hundreds of physically-separated graphics processing units (GPUs), which are specialized circuits designed to quickly carry out computations on very large datasets, designed by the likes of hardware giant Nvidia. To multiply numbers from matrices on different GPUs, data must be moved around, a process which creates most of the neural network’s costs in terms of time and energy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Eliminating matrix multiplication&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The researchers came up with a strategy to avoid using matrix multiplication using two main techniques. The first is a method to force all the numbers within the matrices to be ternary, meaning they can take one of three values: negative one, zero, or positive one. This allows the computation to be reduced to summing numbers rather than multiplying.&nbsp;</p><p>From a computer science perspective the two algorithms can be coded the exact same way, but the way Eshraghian’s team’s method works eliminates a ton of cost on the hardware side.&nbsp;</p><p>“From a circuit designer standpoint, you don't need the overhead of multiplication, which carries a whole heap of cost,” Eshraghian said.&nbsp;</p><p>This strategy was inspired by a paper produced by Microsoft that showed it was possible to use ternary numbers in neural networks, but did not go as far as to get rid of matrix multiplication, or open-sourcing their model to the public. To do this, the researchers adjusted the strategy of how the matrices communicate with each other.</p><p>Instead of multiplying every single number in one matrix with every single number in the other matrix, as is typical, the researchers devised a strategy to produce the same mathematical results. In this approach, the matrices are overlaid and only the most important operations are performed.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s quite light compared to matrix multiplication,” said Rui-Jie Zhu, the paper’s first author and a graduate student in Eshraghian’s group. “We replaced the expensive operation with cheaper operations.”&nbsp;</p><p>Although they reduced the number of operations, the researchers were able to maintain the performance of the neural network by introducing time-based computation in the training of the model. This enables the network to have a “memory” of the important information it processes, enhancing performance. This technique paid off — the researchers compared their model to Meta’s state-of-the-art algorithm called Llama, and were able to achieve the same performance, even at a scale of billions of model parameters.</p><p><strong>Custom chips</strong></p><p>The researchers designed their neural network to operate on GPUs, as they have become ubiquitous in the AI industry, allowing the team’s software to be readily accessible and useful to anyone who might want to use it.</p><p>On standard GPUs, the researchers saw that their neural network achieved about 10 times less memory consumption and operated about 25 percent faster than other models. Reducing the amount of memory needed to run a powerful large language model could provide a path forward to enabling the algorithms to run at full capacity on devices with smaller memory like smartphones.</p><p>Nvidia, the dominant producer of GPUs worldwide, designs their hardware to be highly optimized to perform matrix multiplication, which has enabled them to dominate the industry and launched them to be one of the most profitable companies in the world. However, this hardware is not fully optimized for ternary operations.</p><p>To push the energy savings even further, the team collaborated with Assistant Professor Dustin Richmond and Lecturer Ethan Sifferman in the Baskin Engineering Computer Science and Engineering department to create custom hardware. Over three weeks, the team created a prototype of their hardware on a highly-customizable circuit called a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). This hardware enables them to take full advantage of all the energy-saving features they programmed into the neural network.</p><p>With this custom hardware, the model surpasses human-readable throughput, meaning it produces words faster than the rate a human reads, on just 13 watts of power. Using GPUs would require about 700 watts of power, meaning that the custom hardware achieved more than 50 times the efficiency of GPUs.&nbsp;</p><p>With further development, the researchers believe they can further optimize the technology for even more energy efficiency.</p><p>“These numbers are already really solid, but it is very easy to make them much better,” Eshraghian said. “If we’re able to do this within 13 watts, just imagine what we could do with a whole data center worth of compute power. We’ve got all these resources, but let’s use them effectively.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>It has been nearly a decade since hackers dumped huge amounts of personal data from Ashley Madison, the infamous dating site which, back in 2015, catered mostly to men who wanted to cheat on their wives. Now, that story is back in the media, partly because of a recent <a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81602884">Netflix</a> documentary about it.</p>
<p>You can see me in that series, a nerdy talking head in clips from various TV news shows from 2015, because I was one of the journalists breaking the story. But neither the Netflix series nor the handful of other documentaries still in the works get at what was truly revolutionary – and chilling – about the Ashley Madison affair.</p>
<p>Generally, the media has focused on the (mainly) men whose names and desires were taken from the company’s subscriber database and shared with the world. But that isn’t a new story. People have been trying to have affairs with strangers for thousands of years. Ashley Madison was never really about that. Avid Life Media, its parent company, wasn’t in the business of sex, it was in the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ashleymadison-cyber-idUSKCN0ZL09J/">business</a> of bots. Its site became a prototype for what social media platforms such as Facebook are becoming: places so packed with AI-generated nonsense that they feel like spam cages, or information prisons where the only messages that get through are auto-generated ads.</p>
<span></span><p>After a rebrand, Ashley Madison is now owned by Ruby Life and bills itself as a spicy dating site for married people. But back then, it marketed itself as a social networking site for men seeking affairs with women. In late 2015, a group calling itself Impact Team got angry at the site and hacked into its servers. The group grabbed a bunch of user data and code, then posted it on Reddit with the claim that 95 per cent of the people on the site were men. I was intrigued. How could all those men be having affairs, if there were virtually no women on the site?</p>
<p>With the help of two hackers and a database expert, I decided to find out. What I <a href="https://gizmodo.com/ashley-madison-code-shows-more-women-and-more-bots-1727613924">discovered</a> was a bizarre scam – though it was far more like <i>Westworld</i> than US reality show <i>Cheaters</i>. The company had systematically created an army of fake women, mostly very simple chatbots called engagers, who would flirt with men to lure them into paying for a subscription to the site. As I <a href="https://gizmodo.com/almost-none-of-the-women-in-the-ashley-madison-database-1725558944">wrote</a> in 2015, “it’s like a science fictional future where every woman on Earth is dead, and some Dilbert-like engineer has replaced them with badly-designed robots”. Back then, I repeatedly contacted Avid Life Media for comment, but it wouldn’t reply.</p>
<p>As we pored over the code, we found that, although there were a few human women on the site, more than 11 million interactions logged in the database were between human men and female bots. And the men had to pay for every single message they sent. For most of their millions of users, Ashley Madison affairs were entirely a fantasy built out of threadbare chatbot pick-up lines like “how r u?” or “whats up?”</p>
<p>There were real women behind the curtain, though. We found company emails in the data dump and discovered that Avid Life Media was also <a href="https://gizmodo.com/ashley-madison-code-shows-more-women-and-more-bots-1727613924#_ga=1.211307349.1523925811.1419643295">paying</a> a small number of workers to generate fake profiles for more than 70,000 engager bots.</p>
<p>One of these workers <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/ex-employees-lawsuit-over-wrist-injury-frivolous-dating-website-for-cheaters-says/article15380399/">sued</a> the company in 2013, arguing that she had been required to type up so many fake profiles that she permanently injured her wrists (the lawsuit was dropped in 2015). It gets weirder: we found an internal email where employees discussed a <a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-ashley-madison-hid-its-fembot-con-from-users-and-in-1728410265">tool</a> they had built called fraud-to-engager, which automatically converted fraudulent profiles from other Avid Life Media sites into Ashley Madison bot profiles. “Should tweak it and rename it,” one employee suggested.</p>
<p>At the time, I was shocked by the sheer number of fake women. I <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-fembots-of-ashley-madison-1726670394">wrote</a>: “Instead of looking at Ashley Madison as a dating site, I think it’s more accurate to call it an anti-community—a hugely popular social site where it’s impossible to be social, because the men can’t talk to each other, most of the women are fake, and the only interaction available is with credit card payments.”</p>
<p>Nine years later, this could describe any number of social media sites that have become swamped with bots and AI-generated absurdity – and charge you for the privilege of interacting with techno-phantoms. Currently, Facebook is trying to figure out how to deal with millions of fake images generated by AI, while Google’s AI bot Overviews is telling users to <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2433133-can-google-fix-its-disastrous-new-ai-search-tool/">glue cheese to pizza</a>. The problem is, human beings are interacting with these AI images and suggestions, in some cases imagining they are engaging with real people.</p>
<p>It is like the whole world has become the Ashley Madison of 2015, and the more we want to talk to each other about it, the less likely we are to find a human to talk to.</p>

<p>One of Windows 11's more contentious changes is that, by default, both the Home and Pro editions of the operating system require users to sign in with a Microsoft account during setup. Signing in with an account does get you some benefits, at least if you're a regular user of other Microsoft products like OneDrive, GamePass, or Microsoft 365 (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/rip-to-microsoft-office-henceforth-to-be-known-as-microsoft-365/">aka Office</a>). But if you don't use those services, a lot of what a Microsoft account gets you in Windows 11 is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/windows-11-has-made-the-clean-windows-install-an-oxymoron/">repeated ads and reminders</a> about signing up for those services. Using Windows with a traditional local account is still extremely possible, but it does require a small amount of know-how beyond just clicking the right buttons.</p>

<p>On the know-how front, Microsoft has taken one more minor, but nevertheless irritating, step away from allowing users to sign in with local accounts. This <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-from-a-local-account-to-a-microsoft-account-395203bf-9f1b-eb24-b042-5b8dae6c1d20">official Microsoft support page</a> walks users with local accounts through the process of signing in to a Microsoft account. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240612104753/https:/support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-from-a-local-account-to-a-microsoft-account-395203bf-9f1b-eb24-b042-5b8dae6c1d20">As recently as June 12</a>, that page also included instructions for converting a Microsoft account into a local account. But according to Tom's Hardware and the Internet Wayback Machine, those instructions <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240617103839/https:/support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-from-a-local-account-to-a-microsoft-account-395203bf-9f1b-eb24-b042-5b8dae6c1d20">disappeared on or around June 17</a> and haven't been seen since.</p>
<p>Despite the documentation change, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/what-i-do-to-clean-up-a-clean-install-of-windows-11-23h2-and-edge/">most of the workarounds</a> for creating a local account still work in both Windows 11 23H2 (the publicly available version of Windows 11 for most PCs) and 24H2 (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/windows-11-24h2-is-released-to-the-public-but-only-on-copilot-pcs-for-now/">available now on Copilot+ PCs</a>, later this fall for everyone else). The easiest way to do it on a PC you just took out of the box is to press Shift+F10 during the setup process to bring up a command prompt window, typing <code>OOBE\BYPASSNRO</code>, rebooting, and then clicking the "I don't have Internet" button when asked to connect to a Wi-Fi network.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Other workarounds include using the Rufus tool to create a USB installer that will automatically bypass the Microsoft account sign-in requirement, or (for Windows 11 Pro users) indicating that you want to join the PC to a corporate domain and then not actually joining it to a domain. Setting the PC up with a Microsoft account and then signing out afterward is also still an option.</p>
<p>There is one workaround that has allegedly stopped working—it used to be that trying to "sign in" with a nonexistent email account would get you a local sign-in option. But as of earlier this month, <a href="https://x.com/zacbowden/status/1797496910737252744">according to Windows Central editor Zac Bowden</a>, it looks like the Windows 11 setup screen will just ask you to try another email address instead.</p>
<p>To be fair to Microsoft, all the big tech companies want you to sign in with an account before you can use all the features of the software, but neither Apple nor Google goes as far as to <em>mandate</em> account sign-in to access basic functionality. Macs, iPhones, and iPads will all let you complete the setup process without signing in, though you do have to know which buttons to click. Google will allow you to use Chromebooks in guest mode, and Android phones and tablets are still usable without signing in (though this does make it more difficult to find and install apps). Microsoft's pushiness remains unique; there's definitely a difference between a company that would&nbsp;<em>really</em> prefer that you sign in and one that forces you to.</p>

                                        <p>LONDON (AP) — Microsoft violated European Union antitrust rules with “possibly abusive” practices by tying its Teams messaging and videoconferencing app to its widely used business software, the bloc said.</p><p>The European Commission said Monday it informed Microsoft of its preliminary view that the U.S. tech giant has been “restricting competition” by <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/microsoft-office-teams-slack-antitrust-europe-b6c2a18f5420ddd553a4cb6ab79f838f">bundling Teams</a></span> with core office productivity applications such as Office 365 and Microsoft 365. </p><p>The commission, the 27-nation bloc’s top antitrust enforcer, said it suspects Microsoft might have granted Teams a “distribution advantage” by not giving customers a choice on whether to have Teams when they purchased the software. The advantage might have been widened by limits on the ability of rival messaging apps to work with Microsoft software, it said. </p><p>“We are concerned that Microsoft may be giving its own communication product Teams an undue advantage over competitors, by tying it to its popular productivity suites for businesses,” Margrethe Vestager, the commission’s executive vice-president for competition policy, said in a statement. </p>
    

<p>“And preserving competition for remote communication and collaboration tools is essential as it also fosters innovation on these markets.” </p>



<p>The commission took aim at Microsoft a day after <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/apple-european-union-digital-regulation-rules-app-store-07c34a80a5c98d0014e1c669a86af6a4">accusing Apple</a></span> of breaching the bloc’s new <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/digital-markets-act-european-union-rules-apple-5162872791b985e794df9b3a7b46aed1">digital competition rulebook</a></span>, in a flurry of regulatory action underlining Brussels’ leading role as a watchdog for Big Tech companies. </p>
    
<p>Microsoft made some changes last year in an effort to head off an penalty, including offering the software <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/microsoft-office-teams-slack-antitrust-europe-b6c2a18f5420ddd553a4cb6ab79f838f">packages without Teams</a></span> for European customers. But the commission said Tuesday the changes are not enough to address its concerns and that it needs to do more to “restore competition.”</p><p>“Having unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today and will work to find solutions to address the Commission‘s remaining concerns.” Microsoft President Brad Smith said in a prepared statement. </p>
    

<p>In April, the company also gave customers worldwide the option to get Microsoft 365 and Office 365 without Teams. The two software suites include programs like Word, Excel and Outlook. </p><p>Microsoft now has a chance to respond to the accusations, formally known as a statement of objections, before the commission makes its final decision. The company could face a fine worth up to 10% of its annual global revenue, or be forced to carry out “remedies” to satisfy the competition concerns. </p><p>The commission <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/eu-microsoft-antitrust-investigation-teams-office-d7a6f5727387bae9b427d560218be84f">opened its investigation</a></span> in July 2023 after rival Slack Technologies, which makes popular workplace messaging software, filed a complaint with Brussels. Alfaview, which makes videoconferencing software, also filed a separate complaint. </p><p>Slack, owned by business software maker Salesforce, had alleged that Microsoft abused its market dominance to eliminate competition — in violation of EU laws.</p><p>“The Statement of Objections issued today by the European Commission is a win for customer choice and an affirmation that Microsoft’s practices with Teams have harmed competition,” Salesforce President Sabastian Niles said. “We appreciate the Commission’s thorough investigation of Slack’s complaint and urge the Commission to move towards a swift, binding, and effective remedy that restores free and fair choice and promotes competition, interoperability, and innovation in the digital ecosystem.”</p>

          <li>That prefers keeping your data local.</li>
          <li>But it still goes to the internet occasionally to sync with other users, fetch data, back up, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If it doesn’t go to the internet at all, it’s just local software.</p>
        <p>If it doesn’t work offline with data it already has, then it’s just normal cloud software. You all know the type — sorry, Dave, I can’t play the song I just downloaded because your internet disappeared for one second...</p>
        <p>But somewhere in the middle — local-first. We love it because it’s good for the end user, you and me, not for the corporations that produce it.</p>
        <h2 id="whats-the-problem-with-local-first">What’s the problem with local-first?</h2>
        <p>The goal of local-first software is to get control back into the hands of the user, right? You own the data (literally, it’s on your device), yada-yada-yada. That part works great.</p>
        <p>However, local-first software still has this online component. For example, personal local-first software still needs to sync between your own devices. And syncing doesn’t work without a server...</p>
        <p>So here we have a problem: somebody writes local-first software. Everybody who bought it can use it until the heat death of the universe. They <em>own</em> it.</p>
        <p>But if the company goes out of business, syncing will stop working. And companies go out of business all the time.</p>

        <p>What do we do?</p>
        <h2 id="cue-dropbox">Cue Dropbox</h2>
        <p>The solution is to use something widely available that will probably outlive our company. We need something popular, accessible to everyone,  has multiple implementations, and can serve as a sync server.</p>
        <p>And what’s the most common end-user application of cloud sync?</p>
        <p>Dropbox! Well, not necessarily Dropbox, but any cloud-based file-syncing solution. iCloud Drive, OneDrive, Google Drive, <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/syncthing/">Syncthing</a>, etc.</p>
        <p>It’s perfect — many people already have it. There are multiple implementations, so if Microsoft or Apple go out of business, people can always switch to alternatives. File syncing is a commodity.</p>
        <p>But file syncing is a “dumb” protocol. You can’t “hook” into sync events, or update notifications, or conflict resolution. There isn’t much API; you just save files and they get synced. In case of conflict, best case, you get two files. Worst — you get only one :)</p>
        <p>This simplicity has an upside and a downside. The upside is: if you can work with that, it would work everywhere. That’s the interoperability part from Martin’s talk.</p>
        <p>The downside is: you can’t do much with it, and it probably won’t be optimal. But will it be enough?</p>
        <h2 id="version-1-super-naive">Version 1: Super-naive</h2>
        <p>Let’s just save our state in a file and let Dropbox sync it (in my case, I’m using Syncthing, but it’s the same idea. From now on, I’ll use “Dropbox” as a common noun).</p>
        <p>Simple:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/crdt-filesync/naive.webp?t=1719240073" width="685" height="280">        </figure>
        <p>But what happens if you change the state on two machines? Well, you get a conflict file:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/crdt-filesync/naive_conflict.webp?t=1719240073" width="685" height="280">        </figure>
        <p>Normally, it would’ve been a problem. But it’s not if you are using CRDT!</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>CRDT is a collection of data types that all share a very nice property: they can always be merged. It’s not always the perfect merge, and not everything can be made into a CRDT, but IF you can put your data into a CRDT, you can be sure: all merges will go without conflicts.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>With CRDT, we can solve conflicts by opening both files, merging states, and saving back to <code>state.xml</code>. Simple!</p>
        <p>Even in this form, Dropbox as a common sync layer works! There are some downsides, though:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>conflicting file names are different between providers,</li>
          <li>some providers might not handle conflicts at all,</li>
          <li>it needs state-based CRDT.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="version-2-a-file-per-client">Version 2: A file per client</h2>
        <p>The only way to avoid conflicts is to always edit locally. So let’s give each client its own file!</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/crdt-filesync/file_per_client.webp?t=1719240073" width="685" height="280">        </figure>
        <p>Now we just watch when files from other clients get changed and merge them with our own.</p>
        <p>And because each file is only edited on one machine, Dropbox will not report any conflicts. Any conflicts inside the data will be resolved by us via CRDT magic.</p>
        <h2 id="version-3-operations-based">Version 3: Operations-based</h2>
        <p>What if your CRDT is operation-based? Meaning, it’s easier to send operations around, not the whole state?</p>
        <p>You can always write operations into a separate append-only file. Again, each client only writes to its own, so no conflicts on the Dropbox level:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/crdt-filesync/ops.webp?t=1719240073" width="685" height="280">        </figure>
        <p>Now, the operations log can grow quite long, and we can’t count on Dropbox to reliably and efficiently sync only parts of the file that were updated.</p>
        <p>In that case, we split operations into chunks. Less work for Dropbox to sync and less for us to catch up:</p>
        <figure>
<img src="https://tonsky.me/blog/crdt-filesync/ops_batches.webp?t=1719240073" width="685" height="280">        </figure>
        <p>You can, of course, save the position in the file to only apply operations you haven’t seen. Basic stuff.</p>
        <p>Theoretically, you should be able to do operational transformations this way, too.</p>
        <h2 id="demo">Demo</h2>
        <p>A very simple proof-of-concept demo is at <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/crdt-filesync" target="_blank">github.com/tonsky/crdt-filesync</a>.</p>
        <p>Here’s a video of it in action:</p>
        <figure>
          <video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" preload="auto" playsinline="" controls="" width="720" height="721">
            <source src="https://tonsky.me/blog/crdt-filesync/demo.mp4?t=1719240073" type="video/mp4">
          </video>
        </figure>
        <p>Under the hood, it uses Automerge for merging text edits. So it’s a proper CRDT, not just two files merging text diffs.</p>
        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>If you set out to build a local-first application that users have complete control and ownership over, you need something to solve data sync.</p>
        <p>Dropbox and other file-sync services, while very basic, offer enough to implement it in a simple but working way.</p>
        <p>Sure, it won’t be as real-time as a custom solution, but it’s still better for casual syncs. Think Apple Photos: only your own photos, not real-time, but you know they will be everywhere by the end of the day. And that’s good enough!</p>
        <p>Imagine if Obsidian Sync was just “put your files in the folder” and it would give you conflict-free sync? For free? Forever? Just bring your own cloud?</p>
        <p>I’d say it sounds pretty good.</p>

</figure><p>Technology giants such as Meta and Microsoft are describing their artificial intelligence (AI) models as ‘open source’ while failing to disclose important information about the underlying technology, say researchers who analysed a host of popular chatbot models.</p><p>The definition of open source when it comes to AI models is not yet agreed, but advocates say that ’full’ openness boosts science, and is crucial for <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05707-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05707-8" data-track-category="body text link">efforts to make AI accountable</a>.

The legislation will apply less strict regulations to models that are classed as open.</p><p>Some big firms are reaping the benefits of claiming to have open-source models, while trying “to get away with disclosing as little as possible”, says Mark Dingemanse, a language scientist at Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. This practice is known as open-washing.</p><p>“To our surprise, it was the small players, with relatively few resources, that go the extra mile,” says Dingemanse, who together with his colleague Andreas Liesenfeld, a computational linguist, created a league table that identifies the most and least open models (see table). They published their findings on 5 June in the conference proceedings of the 2024 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>.</p><p>The study cuts through “a lot of the hype and fluff around the current open-sourcing debate”, says Abeba Birhane, a cognitive scientist at Trinity College Dublin and adviser on AI accountability to Mozilla Foundation, a non-profit organization based in Mountain View, California.</p><h2>Defining openness</h2><p>The term ’open source’ comes from software, where it means access to source code and no limits on a program’s use or distribution. But given the complexity of large AI models and the huge volumes of data involved, making them open source is far from straightforward, and experts are still <a href="https://opensource.org/deepdive/drafts" data-track="click" data-label="https://opensource.org/deepdive/drafts" data-track-category="body text link">working to define open-source AI</a>. Revealing all facets of a model is not always desirable for companies, because it can expose them to commercial or legal risks, says Dingemanse. Others argue that releasing models completely freely risks misuse.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>But being labelled as open source can also bring big benefits. Developers can already reap public-relations rewards from presenting themselves as rigorous and transparent. And soon there will be legal implications. The EU’s AI Act, which passed this year, will exempt open-source general-purpose models, up to a certain size, from extensive transparency requirements, and commit them to lesser and as-yet-undefined obligations. “It’s fair to say the term open source will take on unprecedented legal weight in the countries governed by the EU AI Act,” says Dingemanse.</p><p>In their study, Dingemanse and Liesenfeld assessed 40 large language models — systems that learn to generate text by making associations between words and phrases in large volumes of data. All these models claim to be ‘open source’ or ‘open’. The pair made an openness league table by assessing models on 14 parameters, including the availability of code and training data, what documentation is published and how easy the model is to access. For each parameter, they judged whether the models were open, partially open or closed.</p><p>This sliding-scale approach to analysing openness is a useful and practical one, says Amanda Brock, chief executive officer of OpenUK, a London-based not-for-profit company that focuses on open technology.</p><p>The researchers found that many models that claim to be open or open source — including Llama from Meta and Google DeepMind’s Gemma — are, in fact, just ‘open weight’. This means that outside researchers can access and use the trained models, but cannot inspect or customize them. Nor can they fully understand how they were fine-tuned for specific tasks; for example, using human feedback. “You don’t give a lot away … then you get to claim openness credits,” says Dingemanse.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>Particularly worrying, say the authors, is the lack of openness about what data the models are trained on. Around half of the models that they analysed do not provide any details about data sets beyond generic descriptors, they say.</p><p>A Google spokesperson says that the company is “precise about the language” it uses to describe models, choosing to label its Gemma LLM as open rather than open source. “Existing open-source concepts can’t always be directly applied to AI systems,” they added. Microsoft tries to be “as precise as possible about what is available and to what extent”, a spokesperson says. “We choose to make artifacts like models, code, tools, and datasets publicly available because the developer and research communities have an important role to play in the advancement of AI technology.” Meta did not respond to a request for comment from <i>Nature</i>.</p><p>Models made by smaller firms and research groups tended to be more open than those of their big-tech counterparts, the analysis found. The authors highlight BLOOM, built by an international, largely academic collaboration, as an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01705-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01705-z" data-track-category="body text link">example of truly open-source AI</a>.</p><h2>Peer review ‘out of fashion’</h2><p>Scientific papers detailing the models are extremely rare, the pair found. Peer review seems to have “almost completely fallen out of fashion”, being replaced by blog posts with cherry-picked examples, or corporate preprints that are low on detail. Companies “might release a nice, flashy looking paper on their website, which all looks very technical. But if you pore over it, there is no specification whatsoever of what data went into that system”, says Dingemanse.</p><p>It is not yet clear how many of these models will fit the EU’s definition of open source. Under the act, this would refer to models that are released under a “free and open” licence that, for example, allows users to modify a model but says nothing about access to training data. Refining this definition will probably form “a single pressure point that will be targeted by corporate lobbies and big companies”, the paper says.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>And openness matters for science, says Dingemanse, because it is essential for reproducibility. “If you can’t reproduce it, it’s a hard sell to call it science,” he says. The only way for researchers to innovate is by tinkering with models, and to do this they need enough information to build their own versions. Not only that, but <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00530-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00530-0" data-track-category="body text link">models must be open to scrutiny</a>. “If we cannot look inside to know how the sausage is made, we also don’t know whether to be impressed by it,” Dingemanse says.

    </div><p>A biofriendly new material made from barley starch blended with fiber from sugarbeet waste—a strong material that turns into compost should it end up in nature—has been created at the University of Copenhagen. In the long term, the researchers hope that their invention can help put the brakes on plastic pollution while reducing the climate footprint of plastic production.</p>


										      
																																	<p>Enormous islands of plastic float in our oceans and microscopic particles of it are in our bodies. The durability, malleability and low cost of plastics has made them ubiquitous, from packaging to clothing to aircraft parts. But plastics have a downside. Plastics contaminate nature, are tough to recycle and their production emits more CO<sub>2</sub> than all air traffic combined.</p>
<p>Now, researchers at the University of Copenhagen's Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences have invented a new material made from modified starch that can completely decompose in nature—and do so within only two months. The material is made using natural plant material from crops and could be used for food packaging, among many other things.</p>
<p>"We have an enormous problem with our plastic waste that recycling seems incapable of solving. Therefore, we've developed a new type of bioplastic that is stronger and can better withstand water than current bioplastics. At the same time, our material is 100% biodegradable and can be converted into compost by microorganisms if it ends up somewhere other than a bin," says Professor Andreas Blennow of the Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences.</p>
<p>Only about 9% of plastic is recycled globally, with the rest being either incinerated or winding up in nature or dumped into enormous plastic landfills.</p>
<p>Bioplastics already exist, but the name is misleading says Blennow. While today's bioplastics are made of bio-derived materials, only a limited part of them is actually degradable, and only under special conditions in industrial composting plants.</p>
<p>"I don't find the name suitable because the most common types of bioplastics don't break down that easily if tossed into nature. The process can take many years and some of it continues to pollute as microplastic. Specialized facilities are needed to break down bioplastics. And even then, a very limited part of them can be recycled, with the rest ending up as waste," says the researcher.</p>

																																						
																																			<h2>Starch from barley and sugar industry waste</h2>
<p>The new material is a so-called biocomposite and composed of several different substances that decompose naturally. Its main ingredients, amylose and cellulose, are common across the plant kingdom. Amylose is extracted from many crops including corn, potatoes, wheat and barley.</p>
<p>Together with researchers from Aarhus University, the research team founded a spinoff company in which they developed a barley variety that produces pure amylose in its kernels. This new variety is important because pure amylose is far less likely to turn into a paste when it interacts with water compared to regular starch.</p>
<p>Cellulose is a carbohydrate found in all plants and we know it from cotton and linen fibers, as well as from wood and paper products. The cellulose used by the researchers is a so-called nanocellulose made from local sugar industry waste. And these nanocellulose fibers, which are one thousand times smaller than the fibers of linen and cotton, are what contribute to the material's mechanical strength.</p>
<p>"Amylose and cellulose form long, strong molecular chains. Combining them has allowed us to create a durable, flexible material that has the potential to be used for shopping bags and the packaging of goods that we now wrap in plastic," says Blennow.</p>
<p>The new biomaterial is produced by either dissolving the raw materials in water and mixing them together or by heating them under pressure. By doing so, small "pellets" or chips are created that can then be processed and compressed into a desired form.</p>
<p>Thus far, the researchers have only produced prototypes in the laboratory. But according to Blennow, getting production started in Denmark and many other places in the world would be relatively easy.</p>
<p>"The entire production chain of amylose-rich starch already exists. Indeed, millions of tons of pure potato and corn starch are produced every year and used by the food industry and elsewhere. Therefore, easy access to the majority of our ingredients is guaranteed for the large-scale production of this material," he says.</p>

																																			<h2>Could reduce plastic problem</h2>
<p>Blennow and his fellow researchers are now processing a <a href="https://phys.org/tags/patent+application/" rel="tag">patent application</a> that, once it has been approved, could pave the way for production of the new biocomposite material. Because, despite the huge sums of money being devoted to sorting and recycling our plastic, the researcher does not believe that it will really be a success. Doing so should be seen as a transitional technology until we bid fossil-based plastics a final farewell.</p>
<p>"Recycling plastic efficiently is anything but straightforward. Different things in plastics must be separated from each other and there are major differences between plastic types, meaning that the process must be done in a safe way so that no contaminants end up in the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/recycled+plastic/" rel="tag">recycled plastic</a>.</p>
<p>"At the same time, countries and consumers must sort their plastic. This is a massive task that I don't see us succeeding at. Instead, we should rethink things in terms of utilizing new materials that perform like plastic, but don't pollute the planet," says Blennow.</p>
<p>The researcher is already collaborating with two Danish packaging companies to develop prototypes for food packaging, among other things. He envisions many other uses for the material as well, such as for the interior trims of cars by the automotive industry. Though it is difficult to say when this biofriendly barley-based plastic will reach the shelves, the researcher predicts that the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/new+material/" rel="tag">new material</a> may become a reality in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>"It's quite close to the point where we can really start producing prototypes in collaboration with our research team and companies. I think it's realistic that different prototypes in soft and hard packaging, such as trays, bottles and bags, will be developed within one to five years," concludes Blennow.</p>

    </div><p>Titan, Saturn's largest moon, is the only other planetary body in the solar system that currently hosts active rivers, lakes, and seas. These otherworldly river systems are thought to be filled with liquid methane and ethane that flows into wide lakes and seas, some as large as the Great Lakes on Earth.</p>


										      
																																	
<p>The existence of Titan's large seas and smaller lakes was confirmed in 2007, with images taken by NASA's Cassini spacecraft. Since then, scientists have pored over those and other images for clues to the moon's mysterious liquid environment.</p>
<p>Now, MIT geologists have studied Titan's shorelines and shown through simulations that the moon's large seas have likely been shaped by <a href="https://phys.org/tags/waves/" rel="tag">waves</a>. Until now, scientists have found indirect and conflicting signs of wave activity, based on remote images of Titan's surface.</p>
<p>The MIT team took a different approach to investigate the presence of waves on Titan, by first modeling the ways in which a lake can erode on Earth. They then applied their modeling to Titan's seas to determine what form of erosion could have produced the shorelines in Cassini's images. Waves, they found, were the most likely explanation.</p>
<p>The researchers emphasize that their results are not definitive; to confirm that there are waves on Titan will require direct observations of wave activity on the moon's surface.</p>
<p>"We can say, based on our results, that if the coastlines of Titan's seas have eroded, waves are the most likely culprit," says Taylor Perron, the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at MIT.</p>
<p>"If we could stand at the edge of one of Titan's seas, we might see waves of liquid methane and ethane lapping on the shore and crashing on the coasts during storms. And they would be capable of eroding the material that the coast is made of."</p>
<p>Perron and his colleagues, including first author Rose Palermo, a former MIT-WHOI Joint Program graduate student and a research geologist at the U.S. Geological Survey, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adn4192" target="_blank">published</a> their study in <i>Science Advances</i>. Their co-authors include MIT research scientist Jason Soderblom, former MIT postdoc Sam Birch, now an assistant professor at Brown University, Andrew Ashton at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and Alexander Hayes of Cornell University.</p>

																																						
																																			<h2>'Taking a different tack'</h2>
<p>The presence of waves on Titan has been a somewhat controversial topic ever since Cassini spotted bodies of liquid on the moon's surface.</p>
<p>"Some people who tried to see evidence for waves didn't see any, and said, "These seas are mirror-smooth," Palermo says. "Others said they did see some roughness on the liquid surface but weren't sure if waves caused it."</p>
<p>Knowing whether Titan's seas host wave activity could give scientists information about the moon's climate, such as the strength of the winds that could whip up such waves. Wave information could also help scientists predict how the shape of Titan's seas might evolve over time.</p>
<p>Rather than look for direct signs of wave-like features in images of Titan, Perron says the team had to "take a different tack, and see, just by looking at the shape of the shoreline, if we could tell what's been eroding the coasts."</p>
<p>Titan's seas are thought to have formed as rising levels of liquid flooded a landscape crisscrossed by river valleys. The researchers zeroed in on three scenarios for what could have happened next: no <a href="https://phys.org/tags/coastal+erosion/" rel="tag">coastal erosion</a>; erosion driven by waves; and "uniform erosion," driven either by "dissolution," in which liquid passively dissolves a coast's material, or a mechanism in which the coast gradually sloughs off under its own weight.</p>
<p>The researchers simulated how various shoreline shapes would evolve under each of the three scenarios. To simulate wave-driven erosion, they took into account a variable known as "fetch," which describes the physical distance from one point on a shoreline to the opposite side of a lake or sea.</p>

																																			<p>"Wave erosion is driven by the height and angle of the wave," Palermo explains. "We used fetch to approximate wave height because the bigger the fetch, the longer the distance over which wind can blow and waves can grow."</p>
<p>To test how shoreline shapes would differ between the three scenarios, the researchers started with a simulated sea with flooded river valleys around its edges. For wave-driven erosion, they calculated the fetch distance from every single point along the shoreline to every other point, and converted these distances to wave heights.</p>
<p>Then, they ran their simulation to see how waves would erode the starting shoreline over time. They compared this to how the same shoreline would evolve under erosion driven by uniform erosion. The team repeated this comparative modeling for hundreds of different starting shoreline shapes.</p>
<p>They found that the end shapes were very different depending on the underlying mechanism. Most notably, uniform erosion produced inflated shorelines that widened evenly all around, even in the flooded river valleys, whereas wave erosion mainly smoothed the parts of the shorelines exposed to long fetch distances, leaving the flooded valleys narrow and rough.</p>
<p>"We had the same starting shorelines, and we saw that you get a really different final shape under uniform erosion versus wave erosion," Perron says. "They all kind of look like the flying spaghetti monster because of the flooded <a href="https://phys.org/tags/river+valleys/" rel="tag">river valleys</a>, but the two types of erosion produce very different endpoints."</p>
<p>The team checked their results by comparing their simulations to actual lakes on Earth. They found the same difference in shape between Earth lakes known to have been eroded by waves and lakes affected by uniform erosion, such as dissolving limestone.</p>

																																						
																																			<h2>A shore's shape</h2>
<p>Their modeling revealed clear, characteristic <a href="https://phys.org/tags/shoreline/" rel="tag">shoreline</a> shapes, depending on the mechanism by which they evolved. The team then wondered: Where would Titan's shorelines fit, within these characteristic shapes?</p>
<p>In particular, they focused on four of Titan's largest, most well-mapped seas: Kraken Mare, which is comparable in size to the Caspian Sea; Ligeia Mare, which is larger than Lake Superior; Punga Mare, which is longer than Lake Victoria; and Ontario Lacus, which is about 20 percent the size of its terrestrial namesake.</p>
<p>The team mapped the shorelines of each Titan sea using Cassini's radar images, and then applied their modeling to each of the sea's shorelines to see which erosion mechanism best explained their shape. They found that all four seas fit solidly in the wave-driven erosion model, meaning that waves produced shorelines that most closely resembled Titan's four seas.</p>
<p>"We found that if the coastlines have eroded, their shapes are more consistent with erosion by waves than by uniform erosion or no erosion at all," Perron says.</p>
<p>The researchers are working to determine how strong Titan's winds must be in order to stir up waves that could repeatedly chip away at the coasts. They also hope to decipher, from the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/shape/" rel="tag">shape</a> of Titan's shorelines, from which directions the wind is predominantly blowing.</p>
<p>"Titan presents this case of a completely untouched system," Palermo says. "It could help us learn more fundamental things about how coasts erode without the influence of people, and maybe that can help us better manage our coastlines on Earth in the future."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Twonkie - a USB-PD sniffer based on Google's <a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/twinkie" rel="nofollow">Twinkie</a></h2><a id="user-content-twonkie---a-usb-pd-sniffer-based-on-googles-twinkie" aria-label="Permalink: Twonkie - a USB-PD sniffer based on Google's Twinkie" href="#twonkie---a-usb-pd-sniffer-based-on-googles-twinkie"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Twonkie is a USB-PD sniffer/injector/sink based on a Google project called Twinkie, re-engineered to be made in one-off quantities by mere mortals.</p>
<p dir="auto">Twinkie is a great and pretty low-cost solution, and it's open-source so anyone could make their own, but unfortunately the Twinkie design uses a six-layer PCB and all BGA/wafer-scale parts - both of which are usually unavailable to the humble hobbyist.</p>
<p dir="auto">So I designed the Twonkie, a slightly wonky sibling of Twinkie. It uses a four-layer PCB that can be manufactured cheaply by lots of services like OSHPark, and it makes a point to use only leaded parts for easier soldering (though the main microcontroller can optionally be QFN too via a dual footprint). The most difficult parts are likely the passives which are all 0402, and the USB-C connectors which are used in an unconventional way by misusing 90° upright connectors as 1.6mm straddle mounts (living up to the concept of being wonky).</p>

<p dir="auto">The PCB is exactly 1 inch squared, so $10 will get you three at OSHPark. In fact, let me take care of that for you:</p>

<p dir="auto"><em>(Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with OSHPark, I just love their service to bits and they've been super helpful chaps time and time again.)</em></p>
<p dir="auto">The v1.0 and v2.0 Gerbers in this repo no longer need the botch wires around Q4 either, I'll update the photo as soon as I get the next board revision back.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What's changed compared to the original Twinkie?</h2><a id="user-content-whats-changed-compared-to-the-original-twinkie" aria-label="Permalink: What's changed compared to the original Twinkie?" href="#whats-changed-compared-to-the-original-twinkie"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>A bootloader button in addition to the USB_ID pin based bootloader selection.</li>
<li>Uses the INA237 part which supports the higher supply voltages of USB-PD Extended Power Range (EPR)</li>
<li>The microcontroller pins are rearranged for easier routing, so you'll need a different firmware. Binaries are provided and the firmware is easy to build from source.</li>
<li>The USB-C connectors are attached in a hair-raising straddle mount configuration. The way they're soldered to the PCB makes them rock solid though, maybe even more solid than the original Twinkie, and they transfer TB3 20Gbit/s lanes just fine.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">I see there's a v2.0 now - what's different?</h2><a id="user-content-i-see-theres-a-v20-now---whats-different" aria-label="Permalink: I see there's a v2.0 now - what's different?" href="#i-see-theres-a-v20-now---whats-different"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The 2.0 version uses a different voltage/current monitor chip compared to Twonkie v1.0, the <a href="https://github.com/dojoe/Twonkie/blob/master/ref/ina237.pdf">INA237</a>, which supports higher bus voltages and therefore makes the Twonkie hardware ready for Extended Power Range (EPR). The INA260 used by Twonkie v1.0 (and the INA231 used by Twinkie) will take damage if subjected to the up to 48V specified by EPR.</p>

<p dir="auto">I'm glad you asked! Get the board made via the OSH Park link above, or supply the v2.0 Gerbers in this repository to a PCB fab of your choice, get the parts from Digikey or Mouser or what have you, and follow the <a href="https://github.com/dojoe/Twonkie/blob/master/hw/README.md">Assembly instructions</a> to build the device. I recommend ordering a few extra parts: Get one more of each Type-C connector since you're going to modify them in ways that might end up with a broken connector, and generously round up the number of 0402 passives since you're going to drop some of them and you will <em>never</em> find them again :)</p>
<p dir="auto">For the firmware, there are <a href="https://github.com/dojoe/Twonkie/blob/master/fw/README.md">Instructions for building and flashing</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/dojoe/Twonkie/blob/master/fw">fw</a> directory.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">None of the parts are available 😭 What do I do?</h2><a id="user-content-none-of-the-parts-are-available--what-do-i-do" aria-label="Permalink: None of the parts are available 😭 What do I do?" href="#none-of-the-parts-are-available--what-do-i-do"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Here are some ideas about replacements for some parts that are most likely to be unavailable. None of these have been tested so you're on your own!</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>INA237:</strong> The INA237 is part of a device family and has two siblings with higher specs that TI claims are drop-in replacements: INA228 and INA238.</li>
<li><strong>STM32F072CB:</strong> For one, the Twonkie has a dual footprint that will fit both the TQFP and QFN variants, i.e. the STM32F072CBT and STM32F072CBU. And if you are willing to sacrifice the PD sink functionaliy and only need the sniffer functionality you could also try the variants with 64k flash instead of 128k (STM32F072C8*) and only flash the first half of the firmware binary. Other device families than the F072 would require extensive firmware changes so I can't recommend that.</li>
<li><strong>USB-C plug / receptacle:</strong> These might be a little trickier. Basically you need one that's meant for being mounted standing up on a board, has all USB-C pins wired out to L shaped pins and doesn't have any metal mounting prongs protruding into the board plane (or if it has you'll have to cut them off).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">I am a noob trying to solder and replicate the Twonkie. Got any beginner tips?</h2><a id="user-content-i-am-a-noob-trying-to-solder-and-replicate-the-twonkie-got-any-beginner-tips" aria-label="Permalink: I am a noob trying to solder and replicate the Twonkie. Got any beginner tips?" href="#i-am-a-noob-trying-to-solder-and-replicate-the-twonkie-got-any-beginner-tips"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The KiCad schematic file contains the vendor part numbers and DigiKey order numbers for each part designator, and I exported the full list into a .csv file too - those are commonly called "Bill of materials" or BOM for short, and <a href="https://github.com/dojoe/Twonkie/blob/master/hw/v2.0/twonkie.bom.csv">this is the one for Twonkie 2.0</a>. You should be able to punch those part numbers into a parts supplier of your choice (I usually use <a href="https://digikey.com/" rel="nofollow">DigiKey</a> but there are plenty others) to find the parts you need. If they have parts in stock they'll happily sell you small quantities, though at an increased price. Take care to order more of most parts than you need - especially the tiny passives (resistors, capacitors...) are easy to lose during assembly.</p>
<p dir="auto">As for reading the schematic, it probably helps to have some familiarity with <a href="https://www.usb.org/document-library/usb-power-delivery" rel="nofollow">USB-PD</a> and the <a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/twinkie" rel="nofollow">original project description</a>, and then read up on the <a href="https://github.com/dojoe/Twonkie/blob/master/ref">device datasheets</a> to understand which part does what.</p>
<p dir="auto">Having said all that, please be warned that the Twonkie is not exactly a noob project - unless you're already familiar with hand-soldering fine pitch SMT parts you may be in for a frustrating experience. Don't let that keep you from trying, but you should know what you're signing up for :)</p>

<p>Microsoft’s team of hardware wizards have spent the last couple of years practicing their Reparo spell and it’s really starting to show. And we’ve noticed, it’s hard not to. It wasn’t that long ago that the Surface team surprised us with a tablet that went from <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Microsoft+Surface+Pro+Teardown/12842">1/10 in 2013</a> to<a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/68671/does-the-surface-pro-9-mark-a-turning-point-for-repairability-at-microsoft"> a stunning 7/10</a> in 2022. Needless to say, the new CoPilot+ devices definitely warranted a check in to see how repair was fairing over at Microsoft.</p>



<p>We weren’t disappointed.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>This time around we decided to take a look at both Surface Pro and Surface Laptop devices. The first time we tore down a Surface Laptop it received an <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Microsoft+Surface+Laptop+Teardown/92915">abysmal 0/10</a>. Some claimed the score was too harsh, our Teardown Engineers thought it wasn’t harsh enough.</p>

<h2>Surface Laptop 7</h2>



<p>The Surface Laptop 7 is an astonishingly repair friendly device, almost the antithesis of the original Surface Laptop. It’s no Framework 13, but it clearly draws inspiration from it.</p>



<p>One of the first things you’ll see when removing the magnetically secured bottom plate is a QR code taking you to the service manuals on Microsoft’s website. The manuals were made available the very day the device was released, something we rarely see in any product category.</p>



<p>The next things you’ll notice are tiny symbols (Microsoft calls them Wayfinders) indicating which component is being secured by the type and quantity of screws. You could easily disassemble this device without using the manual thanks to these Wayfinders.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="3585" height="2390" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/06/21164657/wayfinders.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/06/21164657/wayfinders.jpg 3585w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/06/21164657/wayfinders-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/06/21164657/wayfinders-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/06/21164657/wayfinders-1350x900.jpg 1350w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/06/21164657/wayfinders-300x200.jpg 300w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/06/21164657/wayfinders-600x400.jpg 600w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/06/21164657/wayfinders-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/06/21164657/wayfinders-768x512.jpg 768w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/06/21164657/wayfinders-324x216.jpg 324w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/06/21164657/wayfinders-450x300.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 3585px) 100vw, 3585px"><figcaption>The battery is secured by eight 5IP Torx screws.</figcaption></figure>



<p>A special mention should be made of how most components are accessible without the need to remove additional layers. Need to replace the battery? No problem, it’s just a few screws and a bracket. What if you need to clean the fan? Easy. Just peel back the Surflink cable and undo three screws.</p>



<p>This might seem small to some but it shouldn’t be taken for granted. Take the MSI GS65, a laptop that had its fair share of fan failures. You have to remove <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MSI+GS65+Stealth+Thin+8RE+Fan++Assembly++Replacement/130584">the entire motherboard and thermal management system</a> just to replace a wonky fan!</p>



<h2>Surface Pro 11</h2>



<p>Thankfully the Surface Pro 11 also contained many of the same repairability improvements. A tablet PC will inherently be more difficult to repair when compared to a laptop, purely because the screen removal process can feel a bit hairy.</p>



<p>But if we consider it as its own distinct category of device—comparing it relative to other tablet-like devices and not laptops, which we do in our scoring process—the Surface Pro holds up well for repairability.</p>



<p>As with past generation Surface Pro’s, we have access to the M.2 drive via a small magnetic cover underneath the kickstand. Access to anything else requires some disassembly. With the screen off, we find QR codes and Wayfinder markers to aid in the disassembly process.</p>



<p>There are more layers of components, which is to be expected when you have half the space to work with. The Surflink cable and the thermal management system need to be removed before we can remove the battery. But all in all, the process isn’t too onerous, especially with manuals to hand.</p>

Not a drop of glue in sight.</figcaption></figure>



<p>A note on that Surflink cable, the two screws holding the port in place are non-magnetic. It’s such a small detail but it will be appreciated by anyone who’s ever had to reassemble a magnetic component while dealing with the frustration of having to hold a screw in place with tweezers to prevent it from flying towards the magnet right next to it.</p>



<p>Overall, we were extremely pleased with Microsoft’s continued commitment to repairability. The Surface line of devices have performed such a stunning and swift U-turn from unrepairable to very repairable that we can’t help but be impressed, even if they don’t score a perfect 10/10.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, after careful consideration and much lively debating, we decided to award both the Surface Laptop 7 and Surface Pro 11 an 8/10 for repairability in their respective device categories. </p>



<p>Microsoft’s journey from the unrepairable Surface Laptop to the highly repairable devices on our teardown table should drive home the importance of designing for repair. The ability to create a repairable Surface was always there but the impetus to design for repairable was missing. I’ll take that as a sign that Right to Repair advocacy and legislation has begun to bear fruit.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Jarun Laws lived in his car in a restaurant parking lot near downtown Denver. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/denver-guaranteed-basic-income-gbi-ubi-housing-security-homeless-rent-2024-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">He worked there as a cook</a><strong> </strong>until 2020, and had only $400 a month left after paying bills and child support. That was barely enough to cover his car payments and child support — and not even close to what he would need for rent.</p><p>The 51-year-old<strong> </strong>occasionally spent part of his paycheck on weekend stays at a cheap hotel, where he could spend time with his children. He struggled to afford food, clothes, and medicine — and he had been experiencing homelessness for nearly a decade.</p><div><p>That changed when Laws enrolled in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ubi-cash-payments-reduced-homelessness-increased-employment-denver-2023-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">The Denver Basic Income Project</a>. The pilot program allowed Laws to secure a temporary apartment with furniture, spend more time with his children, and find a better-paying job.</p><p>"I had questioned myself: if I was going to be a good father to my children because I was suffering," Laws previously told Business Insider. "When I got accepted, it changed my life."</p><p>Denver's basic income pilot — which first started payments in fall 2022 — focused on over 800 Coloradans experiencing homelessness, including people living in cars, temporary shelters, the outdoors, or other non-fixed living situations. Participants like Laws were given direct cash payments, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/which-states-cities-have-guaranteed-basic-income-programs-low-income-2024-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">no strings attached</a>, and could spend the money on whatever they needed.</p><p>Denver released the project's one-year report on<strong> </strong>June 18, showing that 45% of participants secured their own house or apartment after receiving basic income for 10 months. They also experienced fewer emergency room visits, nights spent in a hospital or a temporary shelter, and jail stays. The report estimates that this reduction in public service use saved the city $589,214.</p><p>Denver's program initially lasted one year and was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/denver-basic-income-project-ubi-extended-homelessness-poverty-2024-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">extended in January for another six months</a>. Participants were sorted into random groups: one received $1,000 a month for a year; another got $6,500 upfront, followed by $500 a month; and a third got $50 a month as a control group.</p><p>The city of Denver, the Colorado Trust, and an anonymous foundation funded the project and has already provided more than $9.4 million to participants.</p><p>Basic income programs like Denver's have become <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/basic-income-gbi-ubi-low-income-americans-afford-housing-food-2024-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">a popular strategy to reduce poverty</a> in US cities.

Participants in each payment group reported increased financial stability and reduced reliance on emergency financial assistance programs.</p><p>Basic income puts low-income families on "an equal playing field," Nick Pacheco, participant engagement coordinator, said at a press conference. He said the cash payments also help participants get the training and resources they need to establish careers.</p><p>Individuals who received the lump sum or $1,000 a month payments were more likely to find a stable, full-time job than before they received basic income.</p><p>"It's freedom," Pacheco said.

She lived in public housing with her kids, all of whom have intellectual disabilities, though they were displaced shortly after.</p><p>She received monthly Social Security payments, just enough to care for her kids. While staying with a friend, she learned about the pilot program.</p><p>Rodriguez used the payments to fix her truck, transport her kids to school and work, buy new clothing, and secure a lifelong public housing voucher. She also used some of the money to pay $400 for rent, $500 on gas, $100 on hygiene, and $100 on her credit card bill. In addition to returning to school to get her GED, she brought her credit score into the 700s.</p><p>"The program gave me more time to focus on their education and their mental health," Rodriguez said, referring to her children, and added that the program's extension was another lifeline. "I had the space to get them tested and get them diagnosed and connected with the support they need."</p><p>Similarly, Dia Broncucia, 53, and Justin Searls, 45, could also afford essentials like an apartment, a new car, and mental health resources through basic income. They had previously lived in a temporary shelter but could secure a studio apartment for $1,300 a month, along with clothing, hygiene products, and furniture.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/universal-basic-income-ubi-denver-participants-turn-their-lives-around-2023-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Broncucia and Searls said last October</a> that though they had some uncertainties about their future, they felt much stronger and less stressed because of basic income.</p><p>"Starting with nothing and then being able to receive a lump sum of money and then get our payments once a month is why we were able to get on track and stay on track," Broncucia previously told BI.</p><h2 id="fcf290b8-de5d-44fd-9e88-4430ad78df2a" data-toc-id="fcf290b8-de5d-44fd-9e88-4430ad78df2a">Basic income pilots can provide poverty solutions</h2><p>As the basic income pilot<strong> </strong>continues to be successful in cities like Denver, local leaders and economic security experts are looking to translate pilots into policy.

"People are really seeing the power of those pilots, and the power of giving people money and trusting them."</p><p>Denver leaders also hope to extend the city's basic income for a third year. The project is currently raising the millions of dollars necessary to continue efforts in Colorado.</p><p>Donovan said he's paying close attention to results from basic income programs across the country. It's a "really exciting time in the movement," he said.</p><p>"If we're able to move people into housing and out of homelessness at a lower cost and generate better long-term outcomes, why wouldn't we try to expand and build upon that?" Donovan said.</p><p><em>Have you benefited from a guaranteed basic income program? Are you willing to share how you spent the money?
