<p>The week of Donald Trump’s inauguration, Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, stood tall next to the president as he made a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/21/tech/openai-oracle-softbank-trump-ai-investment/index.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (dramatic announcement)">dramatic announcement</a>: the launch of Project Stargate, a $500 billion supercluster in the rolling plains of Texas that would run OpenAI’s massive artificial-intelligence models. Befitting its name, Stargate would dwarf most megaprojects in human history. Even the $100 billion that Altman promised would be deployed “immediately” would be much more expensive than the Manhattan Project ($30 billion in current dollars) and the COVID vaccine’s Operation Warp Speed ($18 billion), rivaling the multiyear construction of the Interstate Highway System ($114 billion). OpenAI would have all the computing infrastructure it needed to complete its ultimate goal of building humanity’s last invention: artificial general intelligence (AGI).</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Art for this story was created with Midjourney 6.1, an AI image generator.</strong></p>

<hr>
<p>But the reaction to Stargate was muted as Silicon Valley had turned its attention west. A new generative AI model called DeepSeek R1, released by the Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer, sent a threatening tremor through the balance sheets and investment portfolios of the tech industry. DeepSeek’s latest version, allegedly trained for just $6 million (though <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/106612-deepseek-ai-costs-far-exceed-55-million-claim.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (this has been contested)">this has been contested</a>), <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12948" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (matched)">matched</a> the performance of OpenAI’s flagship reasoning model o1 <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/open-source-deepseek-r1-uses-pure-reinforcement-learning-to-match-openai-o1-at-95-less-cost/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (at 95 percent lower cost)">at 95 percent lower cost</a>. R1 even learned o1 reasoning techniques, OpenAI’s much-hyped “secret sauce” to allow it to maintain a wide technical lead over other models. Best of all, R1 is open-source down to the model weights, so anyone can download and modify the details of the model themselves for free.</p>

<p>It’s an existential threat to OpenAI’s business model, which depends on using its technical lead to sell the most expensive subscriptions in the industry. It also threatens to pop a speculative bubble around generative AI inflated by the Silicon Valley hype machine, with hundreds of billions at stake.</p>

<p>Venture capital (VC) funds, drunk on a decade of “growth at all costs,” have poured <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/ai-trends-q2-2024/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (about $200 billion into generative AI)">about $200 billion into generative AI</a>. Making matters worse, the stock market’s bull run is deeply dependent on the growth of the Big Tech companies fueling the AI bubble. In 2023, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-chart-shows-how-the-magnificent-7-have-dominated-the-stock-market-in-2023-203250125.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (71 percent of the total gains)">71 percent of the total gains</a> in the S&amp;P 500 were attributable to the “Magnificent Seven”—Apple, Nvidia, Tesla, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft—all of which are among the biggest spenders on AI. Just four—Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta—<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/634b7ec5-10c3-44d3-ae49-2a5b9ad566fa" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (combined)">combined</a> for $246 billion of capital expenditure in 2024 to support the AI build-out. Goldman Sachs <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/images/migrated/insights/pages/gs-research/gen-ai--too-much-spend%2C-too-little-benefit-/TOM_AI%202.0_ForRedaction.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (expects)">expects</a> Big Tech to spend over $1 trillion on chips and data centers to power AI over the next five years. Yet OpenAI, the current market leader, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/openai-reportedly-in-talks-to-raise-6-5-billion-at-150-billion-valuation" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (expects)">expects</a> to lose $5 billion this year, and its annual losses to swell to $11 billion by 2026. If the AI bubble bursts, it not only threatens to wipe out VC firms in the Valley but also blow a gaping hole in the public markets and cause an economy-wide meltdown.</p>

<h3><b>OpenAI’s Ever-Increasing Costs</b></h3>

<p>The basic problem facing Silicon Valley today is, ironically, one of growth. There are no more digital frontiers to conquer. The young, pioneering upstarts—Facebook, Google, Amazon—that struck out toward the digital wilderness are now the monopolists, constraining growth with onerous rentier fees they can charge because of their market-making size. The software industry’s spectacular returns from the launch of the internet in the ’90s to the end of the 2010s would never come back, but venture capitalists still chased the chance to invest in the next Facebook or Google. This has led to what AI critic Ed Zitron calls the “<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-rot-economy/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (rot economy)">rot economy</a>,” in which VCs overhype a series of digital technologies—the blockchain, then cryptocurrencies, then NFTs, and then the metaverse—promising the limitless growth of the early internet companies. According to Zitron, each of these innovations failed to either transform existing industries or become sustainable industries themselves, because the business case at the heart of these technologies was rotten, pushed forward by wasteful, bloated venture investments still selling an endless digital frontier of growth that no longer existed. Enter AGI, the proposed creation of an AI with an intelligence that dwarfs any single person’s and possibly the collective intelligence of humanity. Once AGI is built, we can easily solve many of the toughest challenges <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2025/01/30/the-stargate-project-trump-touts-500-billion-bid-for-ai-dominance/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (facing humanity)">facing humanity</a>: climate change, cancer, new net-zero energy sources.</p>

<p>And no company has pushed the coming of AGI more than OpenAI, which has ridden the hype to incredible heights since its release of generative chatbot ChatGPT. Last year, OpenAI <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/technology/openai-chatgpt-investors-funding.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (completed)">completed</a> a blockbuster funding round, raising $6.6 billion at a valuation of $157 billion, making it the third most valuable startup in the world at the time after SpaceX and ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company. OpenAI, which released ChatGPT in November 2022, now <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-nearly-doubles-valuation-to-157-billion-in-funding-round-ee220607" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (sees)">sees</a> 250 million weekly active users and about 11 million paying subscribers for its AI tools. The startup’s monthly revenue hit $300 million in August, up more than 1,700 percent since the start of 2023, and it expects to clear $3.7 billion for the year. By all accounts, this is another world-changing startup on a meteoric rise. Yet take a deeper look at OpenAI’s financial situation and expected future growth, and cracks begin to show.</p>

<p>To start, OpenAI is burning money at an impressive but unsustainable pace. The latest funding round is its third in the last two years, atypical for a startup, that also <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/03/openai-gets-4-billion-revolving-credit-line-on-top-of-latest-funding.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (included)">included</a> a $4 billion revolving line of credit—a loan on tap, essentially—on top of the $6.6 billion of equity, revealing an insatiable need for investor cash to survive. Despite $3.7 billion in sales this year, OpenAI expects to lose $5 billion due to the stratospheric costs of building and running generative AI models, which includes $4 billion in cloud computing to run their AI models, $3 billion in computing to train the next generation of models, and $1.5 billion for its staff. According to its own numbers, OpenAI loses $2 for every $1 it makes, a red flag for the sustainability of any business. Worse, these costs are expected to increase as ChatGPT gains users and OpenAI seeks to upgrade its foundation model from GPT-4 to GPT-5 sometime in the next six months.</p>

<p>Financial documents reviewed by <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/openai-reportedly-in-talks-to-raise-6-5-billion-at-150-billion-valuation" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (The Information)">The Information</a> confirm this trajectory as the startup predicts its annual losses will hit $14 billion by 2026. Further, OpenAI sees $100 billion in annual revenue—a number that would rival Nestlé and Target’s returns—as the point at which it will finally break even. For comparison, Google’s parent company, Alphabet, only cleared $100 billion in sales in 2021, 23 years after its founding, yet boasted a portfolio of money-making products, including Google Search, the Android operating system, Gmail, and cloud computing.</p>

<p>OpenAI is deeply dependent on hypothetical breakthroughs from future models that unlock more capabilities to boost its subscription price and grow its user base. Its GPT-5 class models and beyond must pull godlike capacities for AI out of the algorithmic ether to create a user base of hundreds of millions of paid subscribers. Yet, with the release of the open-source DeepSeek R1 model earlier this month, OpenAI has no moat for its increasingly expensive products. The R1 matched its performance across math, chemistry, and coding tasks, independently learned OpenAI’s reasoning techniques, and can be downloaded, modified, and deployed for free. Why would people continue to pay $20, let alone the $200 tier OpenAI reserves for its latest, greatest models, rather than use something that can deliver the same performance at a 95 percent lower price?</p>

<blockquote><p>Venture capital funds, drunk on a decade of “growth at all costs,” have poured about $200 billion into generative AI.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><b>Silicon Valley Is All In on AI</b></h3>

<p>Wall Street asked itself the same question after the release of DeepSeek R1 and panicked, wiping more than 15 percent ($600 billion) off Nvidia’s stock price, the largest single-day loss for a company ever. And that’s not the only bad sign Altman received about OpenAI’s future. OpenAI <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openaiin-talks-for-huge-investment-round-valuing-it-up-to-300-billion-2a2d4327" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (is in talks again)">is in talks again</a> to raise more money (less than a year after raising $10 billion) at a proposed $340 billion valuation. In most cases, a startup doubling its valuation would be great news. But for OpenAI, the money may make things worse. It signals a desperate need for cash and puts more pressure on a company that today loses $2 for every dollar it makes. As Zitron pointed out, at $340 billion, few companies have the liquidity to acquire OpenAI, and public investors expect strong returns and profitability to justify an IPO anywhere near that price. Plus, the latest round of funding is being led by Masayoshi Son, a billionaire investor known more for losing money than making it. Given Son’s Vision Fund’s disastrous investing record, Zitron said, it’s as bearish a signal as you could find. Hanging over all this for OpenAI <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/subprimeai/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (is the fact that)">is the fact that</a> Microsoft’s investments in the company, which run north of $10 billion, are not standard equity investments but “profit participation units” that will convert to debt in a year and a half.</p>

<p>It’s not just OpenAI that’s burning through billions. Silicon Valley has hyped AI as the next internet or iPhone, and has invested like it cannot afford to miss out on the next big tech revolution. In 2021, with the last gasp of zero-interest-rate loans paired with trillions in COVID relief spending, venture capitalists <a href="https://www.ccn.com/analysis/ai-companies-raised-50b-2023-vc/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (poured a record $78.5 billion)">poured a record $78.5 billion</a> into the AI space. And, despite a broader slowdown in venture activity, the second quarter of 2024 set the record for quarterly venture investing in AI <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/ai-trends-q2-2024/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (at $23.3 billion)">at $23.3 billion</a>. In fact, 33 percent of VC portfolios <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/33346/ai-share-of-vc-investments-in-the-us/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (are committed)">are committed</a> to AI, another worrying sign of concentration.</p>

<p>Even so, Big Tech companies are the biggest spenders on AI. While VCs dropped approximately $200 billion into AI between 2021 and 2024, Big Tech is on pace to surpass that amount this year alone. According to Goldman Sachs research, cloud computing giants are expected to plow over $1 trillion over the next five years into graphics processing units (GPUs) and to build data centers to power generative AI. AI is an expensive technology like few before it.</p>

<p>All those racks of GPUs and supercluster data centers need power, and the power industry is also embarking on a once-in-a-generation investment spree to keep up. The scale of expected data centers to power generative AI is difficult to wrap your head around. Oracle recently <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/10/oracle-is-designing-a-data-center-that-would-be-powered-by-three-small-nuclear-reactors.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (announced)">announced</a> plans to build a gigawatt-scale data center just for AI, powered by a trio of nuclear reactors, while OpenAI <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/openai-asked-us-to-approve-energy-guzzling-5gw-data-centers-report-says/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (pitched)">pitched</a> the White House on the necessity of five-gigawatt data centers, which would be enough power for about three million homes consumed by a single AI data center. A recent report from McKinsey <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/private-capital/our-insights/how-data-centers-and-the-energy-sector-can-sate-ais-hunger-for-power" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (expects)">expects</a> the electricity going to fuel AI data centers will triple from 3 to 4 percent of the country’s electricity to 11 to 12 percent by 2030. The power industry typically grows 2 to 3 percent a year, far too little to meet the predicted jump in demand. McKinsey estimates that power utilities would have to spend $500 billion on top of their planned capital expenditure to keep up with AI needs. If true, this presents a serious bottleneck for not just OpenAI but the expected growth of the AI industry.</p>

<h3><b>Where’s the Money, Lebowski?</b></h3>

<p>Between VCs, Big Tech, and power utilities, the bill for generative AI comes out to close to $2 trillion in spending over the next five years alone. Adding all this up, some are starting to question the economic fundamentals of generative AI. Jim Covello, head of global equity research at Goldman Sachs, <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/images/migrated/insights/pages/gs-research/gen-ai--too-much-spend%2C-too-little-benefit-/TOM_AI%202.0_ForRedaction.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (doubts)">doubts</a> the technology can recoup what’s been invested as, unlike the internet, it fails to solve complex business problems at a lower cost than what’s available today. Plus, he argues, the most expensive inputs for generative AI, GPUs and energy, are unlikely to decline meaningfully for the tech industry over time, given how far demand outstrips supply for both. While AI-fueled coding could definitely boost productivity, it’s hard to see how it could become a multitrillion-dollar industry.</p>

<p>Surveys confirm that for many workers, AI tools like ChatGPT <i>reduce</i> their productivity by increasing the volume of content and steps needed to complete a given task, and by frequently introducing errors that have to be checked and corrected. A <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3540579/devs-gaining-little-if-anything-from-ai-coding-assistants.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (study by Uplevel Data Labs)">study by Uplevel Data Labs</a> tracked 800 software engineers using Copilot on GitHub and found no measurable increase in coding productivity, despite this exact use case being the one pointed to the most by AI companies. And even productivity gains may come at a cost: Microsoft researchers <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2025/01/lee_2025_ai_critical_thinking_survey.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (concluded)">concluded</a> that workers became more productive using generative AI tools but their critical thinking skills declined, presumably because they were offloading the thinking to AI. Looking past the hype, the business case for generative AI two years after the stunning success of ChatGPT appears weaker by the day.</p>

<p>Even worse, as AI expert Gary Marcus <a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/five-things-most-people-dont-seem" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (pointed out)">pointed out</a>, DeepSeek’s R1 model <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/openai-is-highly-overvalued-and-deepseek-just-blew-up-their-business-model-says-nyu-s-gary-marcus/vi-AA1y0qgI" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (spells serious trouble)">spells serious trouble</a> for OpenAI and the cloud giants. The only way OpenAI could hope to recoup the billions it was spending on GPUs to train bigger and bigger models was to maintain a large enough technical lead over other AI companies to justify charging up to $200 for paid subscriptions to its models. That lead <a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/the-race-for-ai-supremacy-is-over" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (just vaporized)">just vaporized</a> and was given to the entire industry for free. In response, Altman has already twice cut the prices of his subscriptions in an effort to stay competitive. But without millions of paid subscriptions, it’s difficult to see the pathway to profitability for a company that loses $2 for every $1 it brings in and expects costs to continue to grow approximately tenfold in five years. OpenAI has set $100 billion as its break-even point, which would require it to increase its revenue by a factor of 25 in just five years, an incredible feat of scale that its current business model does not justify.</p>

<p>OpenAI is, however, the perfect kind of growth-at-all-costs story investors need to think still exists—capable of not only achieving Meta- or Amazon-like growth again, but becoming an indispensable part of growth and innovation in every industry in the future, too. No industry could escape, and software would close its jaws around the world, finally, as Marc Andreessen <a href="https://a16z.com/why-software-is-eating-the-world/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (predicted)">predicted</a> in 2011.</p>

<p>For his part, Gary Marcus has taken to calling OpenAI the WeWork of AI—WeWork, of course, is the poster boy for wasteful, nearly fraudulent, growth-at-all-costs investing that led to a spectacular downfall. Marcus is so confident current approaches cannot take us to the promised land of AGI that he bet Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei $100,000 that AGI would not be achieved by the end of 2027. Without AGI, the valuations of leading AI startups like OpenAI ($340 billion) and Anthropic (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/24/anthropic-closes-in-on-3point5-billion-funding-round-.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window ($61.5 billion))">$61.5 billion)</a> stop making sense. If GPUs are no longer the most capital-efficient or effective way to build better AI models, then the expected AI computing “supercycle” that the hundreds of billions in capital expenditure is premised on never arrives. Instead, the underlying asset bubble of a multitrillion-dollar bet on GPUs as the necessary component to an internet-like era of growth vanishes into thin air.</p>

<blockquote><p>For many workers, AI tools reduce their productivity by increasing the volume of steps needed to complete a given task.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><b>Just How Big Will the Blast Be?</b></h3>

<p>OpenAI’s incredible burn rate, the trillions in capital expenditure by cloud giants and utilities to build out the infrastructure necessary to support AI, the supply bottlenecks ahead from the power and semiconductor industries, and the questionable economic gains from these tools all point to a generative AI bubble. Should the bubble burst, startups and venture funds alike face possible extinction, and a big enough drop from the Magnificent Seven could spark skittish markets to panic, leading to wider economic contagion, given how dependent on the growth of the top technology companies the public markets have become.</p>

<p>In 2024, the Magnificent Seven <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/how-magnificent-7-affects-sp-500-stock-market-concentration.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (were responsible)">were responsible</a> for the lion’s share of the growth of the S&amp;P 500, with the returns of the other 493 companies flat. When Nvidia hit its peak valuation of $3 trillion over the summer, just five of the seven—Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Amazon—accounted for 29 percent of the total index’s value, <a href="https://www.inc.com/phil-rosen/stock-market-outlook-nvidia-apple-microsoft-amazon-recession-fed-rates.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (surpassing)">surpassing</a> the concentration of the five top technology companies just before the dot-com crash. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/echoes-dotcom-bubble-haunt-ai-driven-us-stock-market-2024-07-02/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (Nvidia)">Nvidia</a> has been on an incredible bull run over the last five years, its shares <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/echoes-dotcom-bubble-haunt-ai-driven-us-stock-market-2024-07-02/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (gaining a dizzying 4,300 percent)">gaining a dizzying 4,300 percent</a>, reminiscent of how network equipment maker Cisco grew about 4,500 percent in the five years leading up to its peak just before the dot-com crash in 2000.</p>

<p>Nvidia and the other Magnificent Seven members are in a codependent relationship when it comes to AI hype. They are Nvidia’s biggest customers, feeding the bull run by pushing demand for GPUs beyond even what chipmaker TSMC can supply. At the moment, Nvidia can pass those prices on to their customers, the only clusters big enough for AI computing. But should demand for AI fall, all seven will tumble with it.</p>

<p>For the tech industry, DeepSeek is a threat to its incredible bull run because it proved three things. First, frontier AI models could be trained much more cheaply and efficiently than the current Silicon Valley approach of building massive models requiring hundreds of thousands of GPUs to train. From a capital perspective, the U.S. strategy is wasteful, relying on at least ten times the investment to make similar model progress. Second, DeepSeek showed you could train a state-of-the-art model without the latest GPUs, calling into question the current demand for the latest GPUs that is so hot customers have been facing delays of six months to a year to get their hands on them. Finally, the high valuations of leading AI startups depend on a technical lead in their models to charge prices anywhere near what they need to recoup their computing costs, but that technical lead, enabled by a combination of closed-source models, billions in capital expenditure, and export controls blocking Chinese companies like DeepSeek from accessing the latest GPUs, is gone. Should demand for GPUs fall or even not hit the exponential increases the billions invested are betting on, the bubble will pop.</p>

<p>Given the stock market’s dependence on tech companies for growth, the trigger may not come from the AI industry itself, but any pullback in spending will crater the current trajectory of the AI industry. Many potential triggers abound: a crypto crash; President Trump’s trade wars with Canada, Mexico, and China; the stated goal to cut more than $1 trillion of government spending by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency; or a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, where <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/taiwan-makes-the-majority-of-the-worlds-computer-chips-now-its-running-out-of-electricity/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (nearly 70 percent)">nearly 70 percent</a> of the world’s advanced computer chips are manufactured. You can tell Wall Street is worried about a bubble, because Nvidia is hit the hardest by any bearish AI news, and even when the market panic has nothing to do with the tech industry, like when the Japan currency trade happened last summer, the Magnificent Seven suffer punishing losses.</p>

<p>The AI bubble wobbles more precariously by the day. Some bubbles, like that of the dot-com crash, end up being positive in the long run, despite the short-term economic pain of it bursting. But some, like the 2008 housing bubble, leave permanent scars on the economy and can knock an entire industry off its growth trajectory for years. To date, the U.S. housing industry <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/home-building-in-the-u-s-still-hasnt-recovered-from-the-last-recession-heres-why-51568282700" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (has not recovered)">has not recovered</a> to pre-2008 growth trend lines, a major contributor to the housing crisis gripping the U.S. That is the fire that the tech industry is playing with today.</p>

<p>This is not the Silicon Valley of lore. Venture investors, for all their tech manifestos celebrating “<a href="https://a16z.com/the-little-tech-agenda/" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (little tech)">little tech</a>” and entrepreneurship, have come to <a href="https://www.irmagazine.com/shareholder-targeting-id/how-sovereign-wealth-funds-are-inflating-silicon-valley-bubble" target="_blank" aria-label="Link opens in new window (resemble)">resemble</a> more traditional financial firms, raising money from pension funds, hedge funds, and sovereign wealth funds. Silicon Valley has gone corporate and managerial; even private equity invests in the Valley today. The fusion of venture capital and Wall Street threatens to bring the unbridled speculation of unregulated finance and the breathless tech industry hype together in a single, massive bubble. Inimical to the old ethos of the Valley and emblematic of a bloated, rotten investing strategy, in Silicon Valley now the money chases founders rather than founders chasing money. Maybe, after the fallout of the AI bubble is felt and the sun sets on Silicon Valley for a bit, the tech world can do a hard reset and return to its more innovative days again.</p>

<p>The official numbers from ACEA are out, and they confirmed that Tesla deliveries have crashed by 43% in Europe so far this year.</p>



<p>It should be concerning for Tesla as electric vehicle sales are up 31% during the period.</p>



<p>Based on the main European auto markets already having reported vehicle registrations earlier this month, we already had <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/03/05/tesla-tsla-sales-crash-continues-in-europe-with-germany-down-70/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a good idea of Tesla’s performance in the market</a>, but now the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) has made it official.</p>



<p>ACEA has released February registration numbers confirming that Tesla only delivered 16,888 units in the EU, EFTA, and UK markets in February 2025, compared to 28,182 units in 2024.</p>	
	



<p>For the first two months of the year, it totals 26,619 units, or 42.6% less than the 46,343 units delivered during the same period in 2024.</p>



<p>This is amid a 3.4% decline in automotive sales in Europe, but Tesla can hardly use that as an excuse since ACEA is reporting a 28.4% (31% in EU, EFTA, and UK) increase in battery-electric vehicle (BEV) sales this year despite Tesla’s erosion in the market:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Across the first two months of 2025</strong>, new battery-electric car sales grew by 28.4%, to 255,489 units, capturing 15.2% of total EU market share. Three of the four largest markets in the EU, accounting for 64% of all battery-electric car registrations, recorded robust double-digit gains: Germany (+41%), Belgium (+38%), and the Netherlands (+25%). This contrasted with France, which saw a slight decline of 1.3%.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the EU, EFTA, and UK markets, BEVs account for 17% of the entire auto market, with PHEVs adding another 7%.</p>



<p>Tesla had the worst performance of all automakers in the market:</p>

<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>Tesla fans are holding on to the idea that this is not a real problem because it is mostly due to the Model Y changeover, but that’s simply not true.</p>



<p>Model 3 registrations are also down in most European markets, despite Tesla having a similar situation as Model Y for Model 3 during this time last year.</p>



<p>In fact, Model 3 is down 29.4% in Europe so far this year despite plenty of inventory.</p>



<p>The shift to the new Model Y design is certainly having an effect, but it cannot account for the 43% drop in deliveries.</p>



<p>With deliveries of the new Model Y having started this month in Europe, we can see Tesla is still suffering in markets that report registration daily.</p>



<p>Tesla has only delivered 655 cars so far in March in Sweden compared to 2,524 for the whole month of March in 2024.</p>



<p>In Norway, Tesla is at 1,444 deliveries compared to 2,334 units for the whole month of March in 2024.</p>



<p>Tesla is already down 20,000 units in Europe for the first two months of the year compared to its 2024 performance, and that number could grow to 30,000 units by the end of the quarter.</p>

In 2022, he officially became the company's Vice Chairman and CEO.

More recently, he was seen internally as X’s defacto head of engineering and product, especially with Musk recently focusing more of his time on xAI and DOGE.

Their LinkedIn profiles show that they also work at xAI, which has become <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/10/24339249/elon-musk-xai-x-twitter">increasingly intertwined</a> with X over the last year.</p><div><div><p id="do-you-work-at-x-or-xai"><h2><strong>Do you work at X or xAI?</strong></h2></p></div><p> I’d love to chat.

<p>The year was 2010.  “Ke$ha's Tik Tok”  was topping the Billboard charts.  Steve Jobs has just introduced a goofy new oversized iPhone called an “iPad”.  And in running forums across the internet far and wide, hoards of enthusiasts preached the gospel of a new way of running: without shoes.</p><figure><img src="https://api.needto.run/content/images/2024/01/barefoot.png" alt="A graph of Google search interest in barefoot running showing a huge spike around 2010, which trails off by 2013" loading="lazy" width="1136" height="580" srcset="https://api.needto.run/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/barefoot.png 600w, https://api.needto.run/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/barefoot.png 1000w, https://api.needto.run/content/images/2024/01/barefoot.png 1136w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Google Trends interest in "Barefoot Running" from 2004 to present</span></figcaption></figure><p>The “Great Barefoot Running Hysteria of 2010”, as I call it, took the amateur running world by storm.  Propelled by dramatic claims of performance improvements and injury prevention, barefoot running gave rise to a vocal (and often militant) contingent of enthusiasts and entirely new classes of footwear.  And then over the course of a several years, it faded away almost as quickly as it came, leaving behind changes in running shoes and culture forever.  In this post, we'll explore the history and legacy of the barefoot running movement.</p><h3 id="the-barefoot-running-movement-how-it-started">The Barefoot Running Movement &amp; How It Started</h3><p>Barefoot running is–of course–as old as humanity itself. In fact, people have run barefoot throughout most of human history, with the practice continuing today in several cultures, such as Kenya and indigenous peoples in Mexico.  </p><p>In this sense, before addressing the modern origins of <em>barefoot </em>running, we need to talk about the origins of <em>shod </em>running<em>.</em>  The concept of running shoes as we understand them today, specifically designed to improve running efficiency and comfort, did not emerge until the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This evolution coincided with the rise of organized sports and recreational running, which spurred the development of footwear tailored to the specific needs of runners. </p><figure><img src="https://api.needto.run/content/images/2024/05/lord-spencers-shoes-the-first-specialized-running-shoes-ever-made-from-1865-2.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="460" height="347"></figure><p>The first breakthrough came in 1865 when an English shoemaker brilliantly suggested adding spikes to otherwise normal-looking dress shoes to make them suitable for cross-country running. Later, in the early 20th century, shoes with rubber soles were introduced, offering improved grip and shock absorption, marking a significant advancement in the design of running shoes.</p><blockquote>The result of these running shoe trends was running shoe stores filled with bulky, over-engineered clown shoes that promised to prevent running injuries, but probably didn't.</blockquote><p>Into more modern times, running shoes continued to evolve past their humble beginnings into heavier, more complex footwear with exotic materials like plastics &amp; EVA foam.  In the 80s and 90s, many shoemakers became fixated on <em>stability </em>and the notion that pronation, the natural roll of the foot after it lands, was a cause for running injuries.  Running shoes were increasingly designed to try to prevent this movement with wedges of foam that support and stabilize the arch of the foot, a high heel-to-toe drop, and other questionable features like plastic air bubbles in the heel to cushion the foot with each step.</p><p>The result of these running shoe trends was running shoe stores filled with bulky, over-engineered clown shoes that promised to prevent running injuries, but probably didn't, and were mostly just uncomfortable to use. You can see an example of this kind of design in action in the Nike Air Max 90, which is now also available in a more tasteful re-issue.  While the original was marketed as a running shoe, the modern re-issue is a nostalgic fashion shoe that you should definitely <em>not </em>run in.</p><figure><img src="https://api.needto.run/content/images/2024/03/geqhdlqounif1d4bvgz2.jpg" alt="A bulky black leather running shoe from the 90s with an air bubble in the heel" loading="lazy" width="670" height="464" srcset="https://api.needto.run/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/geqhdlqounif1d4bvgz2.jpg 600w, https://api.needto.run/content/images/2024/03/geqhdlqounif1d4bvgz2.jpg 670w"><figcaption><span>The original Nike Air Max 90</span></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://api.needto.run/content/images/2024/03/air-max-90-mens-shoes-Bd2qnn.png-copy.png" alt="A blue &amp; whit modern re-issue of the Air Max 90 running shoe with an air bubble in the heel" loading="lazy" width="1580" height="877" srcset="https://api.needto.run/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/air-max-90-mens-shoes-Bd2qnn.png-copy.png 600w, https://api.needto.run/content/images/size/w1000/2024/03/air-max-90-mens-shoes-Bd2qnn.png-copy.png 1000w, https://api.needto.run/content/images/2024/03/air-max-90-mens-shoes-Bd2qnn.png-copy.png 1580w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>A modern re-issue of the Nike Air Max 90 (from </span><a href="https://nike.com/?ref=api.needto.run" rel="noreferrer"><span>Nike.com</span></a><span>)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The barefoot running renaissance can thus be understood as a backlash to the dominant running shoe trends at the time.  The revival was driven by a growing dissatisfaction with traditional running shoes, which many believed contributed to injuries and impeded natural foot movement. Proponents of barefoot running argued that it encouraged a more natural gait, reducing the impact on the legs and back and enhancing the overall running experience.</p><p>In 2004, inspired by Stanford athletes training barefoot, Nike introduced the <em>Nike Free</em>, a running shoe that bucked the bulky running shoe trends of the time with a super flexible sole and a minimal heel-to-toe offset.</p><figure><img src="https://api.needto.run/content/images/2025/03/Nike_Free-_3_running_shoe.jpg" alt="A picture of blue Nike running shoes with a flexible sole and a small height difference between the toe and heel" loading="lazy" width="400" height="280"><figcaption><span>The original Nike Free (via Wikipedia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Then, in 2006, Vibram launched the 5-Fingers: a shoe intended to be as close to barefoot as possible, with a thin rubber sole and glove-like fit for the toes.  This was the shoe that truly ushered in the <em>minimalist </em>mindset: running shoes should enable a "natural" gait and that <em>less is more</em>. </p><figure><img src="https://api.needto.run/content/images/2024/03/vibram.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1101" height="695" srcset="https://api.needto.run/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/vibram.jpg 600w, https://api.needto.run/content/images/size/w1000/2024/03/vibram.jpg 1000w, https://api.needto.run/content/images/2024/03/vibram.jpg 1101w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Vibram 5 Fingers (via Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The barefoot-inspired <em>Nike Free </em>and <em>Vibram 5 Fingers</em> set the stage, but the real barefoot running revolution began not with a pair of shoes, but with a book about an indigenous tribe of Native Mexicans.</p><h3 id="christopher-mcdougalls-born-to-run">Christopher McDougall's "Born to Run"</h3><p>While the over-engineered running shoe backlash had already started with shoes like the Nike Free and the Vibram 5 Fingers, the spark that lit the barefoot running powder keg was Christopher McDougall's 2009 bestseller, "Born to Run". The book, which explores the running habits of the Tarahumara Native Mexican tribe, known for their long-distance running ability, captivated the imagination of runners–and non-runners–everywhere. </p><figure><img src="https://api.needto.run/content/images/2024/01/51-Ry-ireXL._SL500_.jpg" alt="A book cover for &quot;Born to Run&quot; featuring an illustration of a barefoot and a man running" loading="lazy" width="500" height="500"><figcaption><span>Book cover for "Born to Run" by Christopher McDougall</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Tarahumara, or Rarámuri, as they refer to themselves, are an indigenous people who reside in the rugged and remote Copper Canyon region of Northwestern Mexico. Renowned for their extraordinary long-distance running abilities, the Tarahumara have garnered international attention and admiration from runners and researchers alike. Their running habits, deeply embedded in their culture and lifestyle, are not merely for sport but serve practical and ceremonial purposes as well.</p><p>McDougall's narrative suggested that modern running injuries were virtually non-existent among the Tarahumara.  They often ran barefoot or in minimal footwear, sandals crafted from leather and tire strips called <em>huaraches.  </em>The sandals provide minimal cushioning and protection, promoting a natural running form that many attribute to their low incidence of running-related injuries according to McDougall.  </p><p>The popularity of McDougall's book sparked widespread curiosity and enthusiasm for barefoot running, and many readers happily ditched their bulky running shoes for new, minimalist alternatives.  As the barefoot running movement evolved, so did the market for running footwear, leading to the development of minimalist shoes designed to mimic the barefoot running experience while providing some protection from the hazards of rough terrain. </p><p>Bolstered by the popularity of "Born to Run", barefoot running was suddenly <em>everywhere.  </em>This period saw a surge in barefoot running clinics, forums, and social media groups where enthusiasts shared tips and experiences.  </p><p>And as often happens, what started as a perfectly reasonable idea took on a life of its own and became dogmatic: barefoot running was <em>the way to run</em>.  The movement gave rise to a series of increasingly lofty and strongly worded claims: barefoot running prevented injuries; barefoot running was more efficient; heel striking was evil; barefoot running was the natural and therefore "correct" way to run.  The idea transcended running communities and seeped into popular culture prompting lofty headlines like this New York Times article, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/magazine/running-christopher-mcdougall.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;ref=api.needto.run">The Once and Future Way to Run</a>.</p><p>The idea even transcended the sport of running itself.  To many, the barefoot running movement was not merely about the act of running without shoes; it represented a broader philosophy seeking to embrace simplicity, natural form, and mindfulness in the pursuit of physical fitness and well-being.  The fervor around barefoot running bordered on religious.</p><p>Despite the smug sense of superiority that some barefoot proponents projected, many of the most enthusiastic adopters of barefoot running were, in fact, novice and inexperienced runners.  While barefoot running enthusiasts were eager to point out elite runners training or racing barefoot, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zola_Budd?ref=api.needto.run">Zola Budd</a>, these barefoot elites are the exception rather than the rule.  Most serious and elite runners generally sat out the barefoot trend, or at least took a more nuanced approach.  Many advanced runners already gravitated towards less bulky shoes, and many that did adopt barefoot running did so as part of isolated workouts on soft surfaces.</p><p>It's difficult to quantify this claim, but my personal memory of this period was that online discourse around running form and footwear was dominated by an aggressive mob mentality around barefoot running.   If you were running with shoes on, you were–according to the online mob–"doin' it wrong", as the internet was fond of saying at the time.  </p><p>Though it generally didn't represent the opinions of more experienced runners, the barefoot running crowd was certainly the loudest. Opinions that didn't completely jive with the all-minimalist approach were often brutally and violently downvoted.</p><p>Despite the enthusiasm and claims of the benefits of barefoot running, research into the practice was thin.  While some of the claims seemed logical, most of the evidence around the benefits of barefoot running was anecdotal.  Much of the argument hinged around barefoot running being the <em>natural </em>and thus correct way to run, and that running with over-engineered running shoes was <em>unnatural</em> and thus incorrect.</p><p>Some will recognize this line of reasoning as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature?ref=api.needto.run#Examples"><em>appeal to nature fallacy</em></a>: a logical fallacy in which a subject is claimed to be <em>good </em>simply because it is <em>natural</em>.  The fallacy pops up frequently in health &amp; medical settings when people extol the virtues of "all-natural" products or alternative medicines.  Sure, some natural products are healthy and beneficial; but so are a lot of deadly poisons.  Similarly, diet, where the appeal to nature is used to justify all sorts of sometimes conflicting food choices (throughout history humans have eaten wildly versatile diets).  This doesn't mean that natural is <em>bad, </em>it simply means that it's not a valid argument in and of itself for the benefits of barefoot running.</p><p>As time went on and the research caught up with the trend, the results were mixed at best: some studies showed potential benefits, while others highlighted increased risks. Critics of barefoot running point to evidence showing an increased incidence of certain types of injuries, such as Achilles tendinitis and metatarsal stress fractures, among runners transitioning to barefoot or minimalist running without proper adaptation. Additionally, there's an obvious concern about the lack of protection from environmental hazards (e.g., sharp objects, rough terrain) when running without traditional footwear, which can lead to acute injuries. </p><p>At the same time, many fledgling barefoot runners soon faced a reality check. Reports of injuries began to surface, casting doubt on the benefits of running without shoes. Podiatrists and sports medicine professionals started warning about the potential risks, especially for those with pre-existing foot conditions, those who transitioned too quickly, or those who tried to run too much. </p><p>Many who stuck with the sport and aspired to run longer distances such as the marathon soon learned that it's simply difficult to put in the mileage required to excel at these distances without proper footwear.  Though you're sure to find counterexamples (I still see a small handful of barefoot runners at major running events like the Boston Marathon), most runners who are putting in 50, 60, 70, or more miles a week to race a marathon are doing so with shoes designed to help cushion the impact.</p><h2 id="long-lasting-changes-to-running-shoes">Long-Lasting Changes to Running Shoes</h2><p>Despite the decline in barefoot running's popularity, its impact on the running shoe industry was undeniable. Recognizing the demand for a more natural running experience, shoe manufacturers began developing more lightweight, minimalist running shoes with less cushioning and a lower heel-to-toe drop. </p><p>More importantly, the minimalist movement helped end the dominance of needlessly overbuilt running shoes.  Of course, highly supportive &amp; motion control running shoes are still available, and some runners prefer to run in them, but it's no longer the dominant paradigm.</p><p>Ironically, the minimalist shoe movement triggered its own backlash with the <em>maximalist </em>shoe movement of mega-cushioned shoes, ushered in by brands like HOKA.  But the maximalist trend is not a return to the <em>overbuilt </em>shoes of the 90s–in fact, it still incorporates minimalist concepts like lower heel-to-toe drop, lightweight materials, and placing less emphasis on the support and motion control that earlier running shoes relied on.  </p><p>These innovations aimed to combine the benefits of barefoot running with the protection and support of traditional running shoes. Today, many of these features remain integral in modern running shoe design, marking a lasting legacy of the barefoot running movement.</p><p>So in the end, while the barefoot running hysteria of 2010 may have been a short-lived trend, it sparked crucial conversations about running health and led to significant advancements in running footwear. Though no longer in the limelight, its impact continues to influence how we run and think about our running gear.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-7528406150771042207" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>The C++ standard library (also know as the STL) is, without a doubt, an astounding piece of work. Its scope, performance and incredible backwards compatibility have taken decades of work by many of the world's best programmers. My hat's off to all those people who have contributed to it.</p><p>All of that is not to say that it is not without its problems. The biggest one being the absolutely abysmal compile times but unreadability, and certain unoptimalities caused by strict backwards compatibility are also at the top of the list. In fact, it could be argued that most of the things people really dislike about C++ are features of the STL rather than the language itself. Fortunately, using the STL is not mandatory. If you are crazy enough, you can disable it completely and build your own standard library in the best Bender style.</p><p>One of the main advantages of being an unemployed-by-choice open source developer is that you can do all of that if you wish. There are no incompetent middle damagers hovering over your shoulder to ensure you are "producing immediate customer value" rather than "wasting time on useless polishing that does not produce immediate customer value".</p><p>It's <i>my</i> time, and I'll waste it if I want to!</p><h2>What's in it?</h2><p>The biggest design questions of a standard library are scope and the "feel" of the API. Rather than spending time on design, we steal it. Thus, when in doubt, read the Python stdlib documentation and replicate it. Thus the name of the library is <span>pystd</span>.</p><h2>The test app</h2><p>To keep the scope meaningful, we start by writing only enough of stdlib to build an app that reads a text file, validates it as UTF-8, splits the contents into words, counts how many time each word appears in the file and prints all words and how many times it appears sorted by decreasing count.</p><p>This requires, at least:</p><ul><li>File handling</li><li>Strings</li><li>UTF8 validation</li><li>A hash map</li><li>A vector</li><li>Sorting</li></ul><h2>The training wheels come off</h2><p>The code is available in <a href="https://github.com/jpakkane/pystd">this Github repo</a> for those who want to follow along at home.</p><p>Disabling the STL is fairly easy (with Linux+GCC at least) and requires only these two Meson statements:</p><blockquote><p><span><span>add_global_arguments('-nostdinc++', language: 'cpp')
</span><br>add_global_link_arguments('-nostdlib++', '-lsupc++', language: 'cpp')<br></span></p></blockquote><p>The <span>supc++</span> library is (according to stackoverflow) a support library GCC needs to implement core language features. Now the stdlib is off and it is time to implement everything with sticks, stones and duct tape.</p><h2>The outcome</h2><p>Once you have implemented everything discussed above and auxiliary stuff like a hashing framework the main application looks like this.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiEpKmdPLSQOlvqiROHQIOEFf96ejCzNHnIReu06sLvUVAtlIcenIWOKCBcT0smhJHsxktrgR63nzQsU3ZrW_-JNnwd3b-rOw-nn6pEilsioc-G2LuMKR4LHYnbUOAo_uVfRRBpFgyEMv_z7vEHbAkFwovyH_RWWPd6-A6sk9qlZeLOKl6Dgczt8ORMBeo/s728/pystd_main.png"><img data-original-height="529" data-original-width="728" height="233" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiEpKmdPLSQOlvqiROHQIOEFf96ejCzNHnIReu06sLvUVAtlIcenIWOKCBcT0smhJHsxktrgR63nzQsU3ZrW_-JNnwd3b-rOw-nn6pEilsioc-G2LuMKR4LHYnbUOAo_uVfRRBpFgyEMv_z7vEHbAkFwovyH_RWWPd6-A6sk9qlZeLOKl6Dgczt8ORMBeo/s320/pystd_main.png" width="320"></a></p><p>The end result is both Valgrind and Asan clean. There is one chunk of unreleased memory, but that comes from <span>supc++</span>. There is probably UB in the implementation. But it should be the good kind of UB that, if it would actually not work, would break the entire Linux userspace because <i>everything</i> depends on it working "as expected".</p><p>All of this took fewer than 1000 lines of code in the library itself (including a regex implementation that is not actually used). For comparison merely including <span>vector</span> from the STL brings in 27 thousand lines of code.</p><h2>Comparison to an STL version</h2><p>Converting this code to use the STL is fairly simple and only requires changing some types and fine tuning the API.&nbsp; The main difference is that the STL version does not validate that the input is UTF-8 as there is no builtin function for that. Now we can compare the two.</p><p>Runtime for both is 0.001 to 0.002 seconds on the small test file I used. Pystd is not noticeably slower than the STL version, which is enough for our purposes. It almost certainly scales worse because there has been zero performance work on it.</p><p>Compiling the pystd version with <span>-O2</span> takes 0.3 seconds whereas the STL version takes 1.2 seconds. The measurements were done on a Ryzen 7 3700X processor.&nbsp;</p><p>The executable's unstripped size is 349k for STL and 309k for pystd. The stripped sizes are 23k and 135k. Approximately 100 k of the pystd executable comes from <span>supc++</span>. In the STL version that probably comes dynamically from <span>libstdc++</span>&nbsp;(which, on this machine, takes 2.5 MB).</p><h2>Perfect ABI stability</h2><p>Designing a standard library is exceedingly difficult because you can't ever really change it. Someone, somewhere, is depending on every misfeature in it so they can never be changed.</p><p>Pystd has been designed to both support perfect ABI stability <i>and</i> make it possible to change it in arbitrary ways in the future. If you start from scratch this turned out to be fairly simple.</p><p>The sample code above used the <span>pystd</span> namespace. It does not actually exist. Instead it is defined like this in the cpp file:</p><blockquote><p><span>#include &lt;pystd2025.hpp&gt;</span>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><span>namespace pystd = pystd2025;</span></p></blockquote><p>In pystd all code is in a namespace with a year and is stored in a header file with the same year. The idea is, then, that every year you create a new release. This involves copying all stdlib header files to a file with the new year and regexping the namespace declarations to match. The old code is now frozen forever (except for bug fixes) whereas the new code can be changed at will because there are&nbsp;<i>zero existing lines of code that depend on it</i>.</p><p>End users now have the choice of when to update their code to use newer pystd versions. Even better, if there is an old library that can not be updated, any of the old versions can be used in parallel. For example:</p><p><span>pystd2030::SomeType foo;<br>pystd2025::SomeType bar(foo.something(), foo.something_else());</span></p><p>Thus if no code is ever updated, everything keeps working. If all code is updated at once, everything works. If only parts of the code are updated, things can still be made to work with some glue code. This puts the maintenance burden on the people whose projects can not be updated as opposed to every other developer in the world. This is as it should be, and also would motivate people with broken deps to spend some more effort to get them fixed.</p>

						If you want to research people's personal experiences of or deep-dives into certain topics, hobbies or interests, then you may find the searchmysite.net public search useful to avoid having to wade through all the marketing websites and blog spam that fill the big search engines. It differs from the commercial search engines because it:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Indexes only user-submitted and moderated sites, rather than indexing the entire internet with all of its spam, "search engine optimisation" and "click-bait" content.</li>
						<li>Does not show adverts and promotes advert-free results pages, to remove the incentives for spam and surveillance capitalism.</li>
						<li>Aims to have a sustainable and user-aligned operating model, planning to pay running costs via the "search as a service" features, rather than relying on advertising which could put it in conflict with user needs.</li>
						<li>Offers an unusually high level of privacy for a search engine, thanks to the operating model which is not based on advertising or collecting personal information for sale to advertisers (see the Privacy Policy for full details).</li>
						<li>Is fully open source, for even greater transparency of the searching, ranking and indexing processes, and for greater community involvement in improving the service.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-event-module="article body" data-flatplan-body="true"><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><small><i>This is an edition of </i>The Atlantic<i> Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. </i><a data-event-element="inline link" data-gtm-vis-first-on-screen31117857_899="351" data-gtm-vis-has-fired31117857_899="1" data-gtm-vis-recent-on-screen31117857_899="351" data-gtm-vis-total-visible-time31117857_899="100" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/atlantic-daily/"><i>Sign up for it here.</i></a></small></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The Trump administration has provided many jaw-dropping moments, but few have been as shocking as editor in chief <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/">Jeffrey Goldberg’s scoop</a> published today. Goldberg reported on how he was inadvertently added to a discussion of a military strike on Houthi militias in Yemen, conducted over the encrypted messaging app Signal. In essence, a reporter was invited to listen while the nation’s top security officials weighed and debated a military action, and was sent detailed information about the strike.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Even President Donald Trump seemed unaware of the breach. “You’re saying that they had what?” he replied when asked about the news. Trump added that he is “not a big fan of <i>The Atlantic</i>,” something he’s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/10/trump-attacks-atlantics-jeffrey-goldberg-over-hitler/680422/">previously made clear</a>, and which makes the unintentional leak all the more remarkable. A spokesperson for the National Security Council said, “This appears to be an authentic message chain, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">I called Goldberg this afternoon to learn more about how the story came about and what the disclosure reveals about the Trump administration. This interview has been condensed and edited.</p><hr><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><b>David A. Graham: </b>Has anything like this ever happened to you before?</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><b>Jeffrey Goldberg:</b> I think that on one level, this is very relatable. Everyone has sent a text or an email to an unintended recipient, and sometimes they’ve embarrassed themselves by doing that. This is, I would say, at a different level—but it kind of proves a point, which is that there’s a reason people who work on sensitive issues in the government aren’t supposed to use Signal, even though it is end-to-end encrypted. Anyone can use Signal, so if you’re not careful, you might pull into your conversation a Houthi sympathizer or a magazine editor.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Our colleague <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/shane-harris/">Shane Harris</a> points out that the phones of top senior defense and national-security and intelligence officials are targets of intelligence operations. Imagine what you can do if you saw everything that the CIA director may be texting, even on a secure phone—especially on a secure phone. I’m mindful of the fact that the Trump team has already dealt with a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/01/classified-documents-trump-case/681327/">serious issue</a> in the securing of sensitive documents in Mar-a-Lago. If you’re going to make a big deal about <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/07/but-his-emails/533274/">Hillary Clinton’s emails</a>, you may want to have excellent communication hygiene.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><b>David:</b> Tell me how you came to conclude that this group was real.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><b>Jeffrey: </b>It was actually chilling: 11:44 a.m., Saturday the 15th, eastern time, in my car in a parking lot, just checking my phone, and I see a text from Pete Hegseth, or somebody who’s hoaxing me as Pete Hegseth. It provides information about upcoming military operations with timings attached: <em>T</em><i>his is going to happen. Then this happens, then this happens, and this happens.</i> I’m sitting there in my car and thinking I’m about to find out if this was an elaborate scam or not. So I thought to myself,<i> I’m sitting here for the next two hours with my hands around my phone.</i> I check on X around 1:55, and yes, Sanaa is being bombed, so then I have the realization that this is almost certainly a real channel and not just an elaborate fakery of some sort. And that’s when I began to realize that I had to write about this massive security breach.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><b>David: </b>You have done a lot of sensitive national-security reporting. Have you ever received any information like this?</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><b>Jeffrey: </b>No, nothing like this. This was like an intravenous drip of information that no one in the government thinks journalists should have. Until almost the very last minute, I could not believe that this was actually happening, that there could be a Mack-truck-size breach, that somehow, the editor in chief of <i>The Atlantic</i> was invited into a conversation with the intelligence agencies, secretaries, the national security adviser. Like most reporters, I’ve been a recipient of leaks. A leak is a totally different thing. That’s a whistleblower trying to make complaints. This is just reckless.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><b>David: </b>There’s the horror that something like this would happen on an operational level, but in terms of what we learn from the substance of the conversation, what are the most important things that people should take away?</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><b>Jeffrey: </b>The actual conversation that they have is fascinating, and in a certain way impressive. It’s nice to see that they’re disagreeing with one another. It’s very useful for the public to know that the vice president has a more hands-off approach than other members of the administration. One of the things that I found interesting was that when a person named “S M” in the chat, who I took to be Stephen Miller, comes in and says, “As I heard it, the president was clear,” this kind of shuts down the conversation. It suggests that Stephen Miller can be in a conversation with, among others, the vice president of the United States and still can get his way. (Miller did not reply to a request for comment or confirm that he is “S M.”)</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><b>David: </b>In addition to the question of how secure Signal is, this is also notable, because without this report, none of these conversations might be preserved for posterity. You note that National Security Adviser Michael Waltz set some messages to disappear after a week or so.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><b>Jeffrey: </b>This is an interesting question: Are they using Signal because it’s convenient? Are they using Signal because it disappears? According to the experts Shane interviewed, the administration should not have established a Signal thread for such conversations in the first place, but once it did, what one is supposed to do legally is copy an official government account, and that government account will then send these threads to the National Archives for posterity, for research, for accountability. But if you’re using a disappearing-text app, I don’t know. That’s one of the questions that I’ve asked and have not gotten answered yet.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><b>David:</b> It is remarkable that this would happen with any reporter. It’s even more remarkable that this would happen with someone like you, and with a publication that has been specifically singled out by the president. Do you have any sense of how this happened?</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><b>Jeffrey: </b>I literally have no idea. The remarkable thing is that no one in the group asked, <i>Who’s JG?</i>, and when I removed myself from the group, seemingly nobody said, <i>Hey, why did JG leave?</i></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><b>David:</b> Are you concerned about retaliation from the Trump administration because of this story?</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><b>Jeffrey: </b>It’s not my role to care about the possibility of threats or retaliation. We just have to come to work and do our jobs to the best of our ability. Unfortunately, in our society today—we see this across corporate journalism and law firms and other industries—there’s too much preemptive obeying for my taste. All we can do is just go do our jobs.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/"><b>Read the full article he</b></a><b><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/">re</a></b><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/"><b>.</b></a></p></section></div>]]></description>

    <p>Every day, researchers search for optimal solutions. They might want to figure out where to build a major airline hub. Or to determine how to maximize return while minimizing risk in an investment portfolio. Or to develop self-driving cars that can distinguish between traffic lights and stop signs.</p>
<p>Mathematically, these problems get translated into a search for the minimum values of functions. But in all these scenarios, the functions are too complicated to assess directly. Researchers have to approximate the minimal values instead.</p>
<p>It turns out that one of the best ways to do this is by using an algorithm that Isaac Newton developed over 300 years ago. This algorithm is fairly simple. It’s a little like searching, blindfolded, for the lowest point in an unfamiliar landscape. As you put one foot in front of the other, the only information you need is whether you’re going uphill or downhill, and whether the grade is increasing or decreasing. Using that information, you can get a good approximation of the minimum relatively quickly.</p>
<p>Although enormously powerful — centuries later, Newton’s method is still crucial for solving present-day problems in logistics, finance, computer vision and even pure math — it also has a significant shortcoming. It doesn’t work well on all functions. So mathematicians have continued to study the technique, figuring out different ways to broaden its scope without sacrificing efficiency.</p>
<p>Last summer, three researchers <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06374">announced the latest improvement</a> to Newton’s method. <a href="https://aaa.princeton.edu/">Amir Ali Ahmadi</a> of Princeton University, along with his former students <a href="https://chaudhrya.github.io/">Abraar Chaudhry</a> (now at the Georgia Institute of Technology) and <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/jeffrey-zhang/">Jeffrey Zhang</a> (now at Yale University), extended Newton’s method to work efficiently on the broadest class of functions yet.</p>
<p>“Newton’s method has 1,000 different applications in optimization,” Ahmadi said. “Potentially our algorithm can replace it.”</p>

<h2><strong>A Centuries-Old Technique</strong></h2>
<p>Mathematical functions transform inputs into outputs. Often, the most important feature of a function is its minimum value — the combination of inputs that produces the smallest possible output.</p>
<p>But finding the minimum is hard. Functions can have dozens of variables raised to high powers, defying formulaic analysis; graphs of their solutions form high-dimensional landscapes that are impossible to explore from a bird’s-eye view. In those higher-dimensional landscapes, said <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/coralia.cartis">Coralia Cartis</a> of the University of Oxford, “We want to find a valley. Some are local valleys; others are the lowest point. You’re trying to find these things, and the question is: What info do you have to guide you to that?”</p>
<p>In the 1680s, Newton recognized that even when you’re dealing with a very complicated function, you’ll still always have access to at least two pieces of information to help you find its deepest valley. First, you can calculate the function’s so-called first derivative, or slope: the steepness of the function at a given point. Second, you can compute the rate at which the slope itself is changing (the function’s second derivative).</p>

<p>Say you’re trying to find the minimum of some complicated function. First, choose a point on the function that you think might be close to the true minimum. Compute the function’s first and second derivatives at that point. These derivatives can be used to construct a special quadratic equation — a parabola if your function lives in a 2D plane, and a cuplike shape called a paraboloid if your function is higher dimensional. This quadratic equation, which is called a Taylor approximation, roughly resembles your function at the point you chose.</p>
<p>Now calculate the minimum of the quadratic equation instead of the original — something you can do easily, using a well-known formula. (That’s because quadratic equations are simple; it’s when equations get more complicated that calculating the minimum becomes prohibitive.) You’ll get a point. Then plug the coordinates of that point back into your original function, and you’ll get a new point on the function that is, hopefully, closer to its true minimum. Start the entire process again.</p>
<p>Newton proved that if you keep on repeating this process, you’ll eventually home in on the minimum value of the original, more complicated function. The method doesn’t always work, especially if you start at a point that’s too far away from the true minimum. But for the most part, it does. And it has some desirable attributes.</p>

<p>Other iterative methods, like gradient descent — the algorithm used in today’s machine learning models — converge toward the true minimum at a linear rate. Newton’s method converges toward it much faster: at a “quadratic” rate. In other words, it can identify the minimum value in fewer iterations than gradient descent. (Each iteration of Newton’s method is more computationally expensive than an iteration of gradient descent, which is why researchers prefer gradient descent for certain applications, like training neural networks. But Newton’s method is still enormously efficient, making it useful in all sorts of contexts.)</p>
<p>Newton could have written his method to converge toward the true minimum value even faster if, instead of taking just the first and second derivatives at each point, he had also taken, say, the third and fourth derivatives. That would have given him more complicated Taylor approximations, with exponents greater than 2. But the whole crux of his strategy was to transform a complicated function into a simpler one. These more complicated Taylor equations were more than Newton could handle mathematically.</p>

<p>“Newton did it for degree 2. He did that because nobody knew how to minimize higher-order polynomials,” Ahmadi said.</p>
<p>In the centuries since, mathematicians have worked to extend his method, to probe how much information they can squeeze out of more complicated Taylor approximations of their functions.</p>
<p>In the 19th century, for instance, the Russian mathematician Pafnuty Chebyshev proposed a version of Newton’s method that approximated functions with cubic equations (which have an exponent of 3). But his algorithm didn’t work when the original function involved multiple variables. Much more recently, in 2021, Yurii Nesterov (now at Corvinus University of Budapest) demonstrated <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-019-01449-1">how to approximate functions</a> of any number of variables efficiently with cubic equations. But his method couldn’t be extended to approximate functions using quartic equations, quintics and so on without losing its efficiency. Nevertheless, the proof was a major breakthrough in the field.</p>
<p>Now Ahmadi, Chaudhry and Zhang have taken Nesterov’s result another step further. Their algorithm works for any number of variables and arbitrarily many derivatives. Moreover, it remains efficient for all these cases — something that until now wasn’t possible.</p>
<p>But first, they had to find a way to make a hard math problem a lot easier.</p>
<h2><strong>Finding Wiggle Room</strong></h2>
<p>There is no fast, general purpose method for finding the minima of functions raised to high exponents. That’s always been the main limitation of Newton’s method. But there are certain types of functions that have characteristics that make them easy to minimize. In the new work, Ahmadi, Chaudhry and Zhang prove that it’s always possible to find approximating equations that have these characteristics. They then show how to adapt these equations to run Newton’s method efficiently.</p>
<p>What properties make an equation easy to minimize? Two things: The first is that the equation should be bowl-shaped, or “convex.” Rather than having many valleys, it has just one — meaning that when you try to minimize it, you don’t have to worry about mistaking an arbitrary valley for the lowest one.</p>

<p>The second property is that the equation can be written as a sum of squares. For example, 5<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + 16<em>x</em> + 13 can be written as the sum (<em>x</em> + 2)<sup>2</sup> + (2<em>x</em> + 3)<sup>2</sup>. In recent years, mathematicians have developed techniques for minimizing equations with arbitrarily large exponents so long as they are both convex and a sum of squares. However, those techniques were of little help when it came to Newton’s method. Most of the time, the Taylor approximation you use won’t have these nice properties.</p>
<p>But Ahmadi, Chaudhry and Zhang figured out how to use a technique called semidefinite programming to wiggle the Taylor approximation just enough to make it both a sum of squares and convex, though not so much that it became unmoored from the original function it was supposed to resemble.</p>
<p>They essentially added a fudge factor to the Taylor expansion, turning it into an equation that had the two desired properties. “We can change the Taylor expansion a bit to make it simpler to minimize. Think of the Taylor expansion, but modified a little bit,” Ahmadi said. He and his colleagues then showed that, using this modified version of the Taylor expansion — which involved arbitrarily many derivatives — their algorithm would still converge on the true minimum of the original function. Moreover, the rate of convergence would scale with the number of derivatives used: Just as using two derivatives allowed Newton to approach the true minimum at a quadratic rate, using three derivatives enabled the researchers to approach it at a cubic rate, and so on.</p>
<p>Ahmadi, Chaudhry and Zhang had created a more powerful version of Newton’s method that could reach the true minimum value of a function in fewer iterations than previous techniques.</p>
        
        
<p>Like the original version of Newton’s method, each iteration of this new algorithm is still computationally more expensive than methods such as gradient descent. As a result, for the moment, the new work won’t change the way self-driving cars, machine learning algorithms or air traffic control systems work. The best bet in these cases is still gradient descent.</p>
<p>“Many ideas in optimization take years before they are made fully practical,” said <a href="https://jasonaltschuler.github.io/">Jason Altschuler</a> of the University of Pennsylvania. “But this seems like a fresh perspective.”</p>
<p>If, over time, the underlying computational technology needed to run Newton’s method becomes more efficient — making each iteration less computationally expensive — then the algorithm developed by Ahmadi, Chaudhry and Zhang could eventually surpass gradient descent for all sorts of applications, including machine learning.</p>
<p>“Our algorithm right now is provably faster, in theory,” Ahmadi said. He’s hopeful, he added, that in 10 to 20 years, it will also be so in practice.</p>

<h3 id="level-up-to-reach-agi">Level Up to Reach AGI</h3>

<p>Good AGI benchmarks act as useful progress indicators. Better AGI benchmarks clearly discern capabilities. The best AGI benchmarks do all this and actively inspire research and guide innovation.</p>

<p>At ARC Prize, our mission is to serve as a North Star towards AGI through enduring benchmarks, directing efforts towards systems capable of general intelligence and significantly compressing the timeline for scientific breakthroughs.</p>

<p>ARC-AGI-1 has measured progress towards AGI since 2019 and was the only benchmark to <a href="https://arcprize.org/oai-o3-pub-breakthrough">pinpoint the exact moment in late 2024</a> when AI moved beyond pure memorization. OpenAI used ARC-AGI-1 to demonstrate this progress with their o3 system which combines deep learning-based LLMs with reasoning synthesis engines.</p>

<p>ARC Prize 2024 inspired thousands of independent <a href="https://arcprize.org/blog/2024-university-tour-recap">students</a> and <a href="https://arcprize.org/2024-results">researchers</a> to work alongside frontier labs on new test-time adaption ideas.</p>

<p>But there is more work to do to reach AGI. AGI still needs new ideas.</p>

<p>We can characterize systems like o3 as going from "zero to one" on the fluid intelligence spectrum. But these systems are highly inefficient and currently require significant human supervision during the training process to adapt to new domains.</p>

<h4 id="announcements">Announcements</h4>

<p>Today we’re excited to launch ARC-AGI-2 to challenge the new frontier. ARC-AGI-2 is even harder for AI (in particular, AI reasoning systems), while maintaining the same relative ease for humans. Pure LLMs score 0% on ARC-AGI-2, and public AI reasoning systems achieve only single-digit percentage scores. In contrast, every task in ARC-AGI-2 has been solved by at least 2 humans in under 2 attempts.</p>

<p>Alongside it, today we're announcing <a href="https://arcprize.org/competition">ARC Prize 2025</a> (going live on Kaggle this week), designed to drive open-source progress on highly efficient, general systems capable of beating ARC-AGI-2.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="easy-for-humans-hard-for-ai">Easy for Humans, Hard for AI</h3>

<p>All other AI benchmarks focus on superhuman capabilities or specialized knowledge by testing "PhD++" skills. ARC-AGI is the only benchmark that takes the opposite design choice – by focusing on tasks that are relatively easy for humans, yet hard, or impossible, for AI, we shine a spotlight on capability gaps that do not spontaneously emerge from "scaling up".</p>

<p>The ARC Prize Foundation adapts this into our definition for measuring AGI: the gap between the set of tasks that are easy for humans and hard for AI. When this gap is zero, when there are no remaining tasks, we can find that challenge AI, we will have achieved AGI.</p>

<p>Addressing these capability gaps requires novel insight and new ideas. Importantly, ARC-AGI does not exist purely to measure AGI progress. It also exists to inspire researchers to work on new ideas.</p>

<p>Intelligence requires the ability to generalize from limited experience and apply knowledge in new, unexpected situations. AI systems are already superhuman in many specific domains (e.g., playing Go and image recognition.) However, these are narrow, specialized capabilities. The "human-ai gap" reveals what's missing for general intelligence - highly efficiently acquiring new skills.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="introducing-arc-agi-2">Introducing ARC-AGI-2</h3>

<p>The ARC-AGI-2 benchmark launches today. This second edition in the ARC-AGI series raises the bar for difficulty for AI while maintaining the same relative ease for humans.</p>

<p>Every ARC-AGI-2 task was solved by at least 2 humans in 2 attempts or less in a controlled study with hundreds of human participants. This matches the rules we hold for AI, which gets two attempts per task.</p>

<p>ARC-AGI-1, introduced in 2019, was designed to challenge deep learning. Specifically, it was designed to resist the ability to simply "memorize" the training dataset. ARC-AGI comprises a training dataset and several evaluation sets, including a private eval set used for the ARC Prize 2024 contest. The training set is intended to teach the Core Knowledge Priors required to solve tasks in the evaluation sets. To solve the evaluation tasks, AI systems must demonstrate basic fluid intelligence or the ability to adapt to novel, never-before-seen tasks.</p>

<p>As an analogy, think of the training set as a way to learn grade school math symbols, and the evaluation set requires you to solve algebra equations using your knowledge of those symbols. You cannot simply memorize your way to the answer, you must apply existing knowledge to new problems.</p>

<p>Any AI system capable of beating ARC-AGI-1 demonstrates a binary level of fluid intelligence. In contrast, ARC-AGI-2 significantly raises the bar for AI. To beat it, you must demonstrate <em>both</em> a high level of adaptability and high efficiency.</p>

<p>While designing ARC-AGI-2, we studied these properties of frontier AI reasoning systems. Below are example tasks to illustrate some of what we discovered. All of the following tasks are part of ARC-AGI-2 and were (1) solved by at least 2 humans in under 2 attempts and (2) unsolved by any frontier AI reasoning system.</p>

<p><em>Note: special thank you to the ARC Prize community for contributing to this analysis, including <a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-153619775">Mace</a>, <a href="https://anokas.substack.com/p/llms-struggle-with-perception-not-reasoning-arcagi">Mikel</a>, and many members in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1237180803335720961/1319729162466099290">ARC Prize Discord</a>.</em></p>

<h3 id="still-hard-for-ai">Still Hard for AI</h3>

<h4 id="symbolic-interpretation">Symbolic Interpretation</h4>

<p>We found that frontier AI reasoning systems struggle with tasks requiring symbols to be interpreted as having meaning beyond their visual patterns. Systems attempted symmetry checking, mirroring, transformations, and even recognized connecting elements, but failed to assign semantic significance to the symbols themselves.</p>

</figure>

<h4 id="compositional-reasoning">Compositional Reasoning</h4>

<p>We found AI reasoning systems struggle with tasks requiring simultaneous application of rules, or application of multiple rules that interact with each other. In contrast, if a task only has one, or very few, global rules, we found these systems can consistently discover and apply them.</p>

</figure>

<h4 id="contextual-rule-application">Contextual Rule Application</h4>

<p>We found AI reasoning systems struggle with tasks where rules must be applied differently based on context. Systems tend to fixate on superficial patterns rather than understanding the underlying selection principles.</p>

<h3 id="datasets">Datasets</h3>

<p>ARC-AGI-2 is comprised of the following datasets:</p>

<table>
    <tbody><tr>
        <th>Dataset</th>
        <th>Task Quantity</th>
        <th>Calibration</th>
        <th>Visibilty</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><a href="https://github.com/arcprize/ARC-AGI-2/tree/main/data/training">Training</a></td>
        <td>1000</td>
        <td>Uncalibrated</td>
        <td>Public</td>
        <td>A spectrum of difficulty ranging from very easy to very difficult for both humans and AI, designed to expose and teach Core Knowledge Priors; use to train your system.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><a href="https://github.com/arcprize/ARC-AGI-2/tree/main/data/evaluation">Public Eval</a></td>
        <td>120</td>
        <td>Calibrated</td>
        <td>Public</td>
        <td>All tasks solved pass@2 by at least two humans; use to test your system.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><a href="https://arcprize.org/guide#semi-private">Semi-Private Eval</a></td>
        <td>120</td>
        <td>Calibrated</td>
        <td>Private</td>
        <td>All tasks solved pass@2 by at least two humans, used for the Kaggle live contest leaderboard and ARC Prize leaderboard. "Semi" means these tasks may have been exposed to limited third-parties (e.g., via API.)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><a href="https://arcprize.org/guide#private">Private Eval</a></td>
        <td>120</td>
        <td>Calibrated</td>
        <td>Private</td>
        <td>All tasks solved pass@2 by at least two humans, used for Kaggle final contest leaderboard. "Private" means these tasks have not been exposed to third-parties.</td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p><code>Calibrated</code> means that these tasks are IDD (independent and identically distributed). In principle, non-overfit scores across the public, semi-private, and private eval sets should be directly comparable. To gather these data, we tested with over 400 humans live in a controlled setting. Human solvability data for public tasks will be open-sourced alongside the ARC-AGI-2 paper in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Like ARC-AGI-1, ARC-AGI-2 uses a <code>pass@2</code> measurement system to account for the fact that certain tasks have explicit ambiguity and require two guesses to disambiguate. As well as to catch any unintentional ambiguity or mistakes in the dataset. Given controlled human testing with ARC-AGI-2, we are more confident in the task quality compared to ARC-AGI-1.</p>

<p>Here's the official <code>changelog</code> for ARC-AGI-2:</p>

<ol>
    <li>All eval sets (public, semi-private, private) now contain 120 tasks (up from 100).</li>
    <li>Removed tasks from eval sets that were susceptible to brute force search (all solved tasks from the original <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/abstraction-and-reasoning-challenge">2020 Kaggle contest</a>).</li>
    <li>Performed controlled human testing to calibrate eval set difficulty to ensure IDD and verify pass@2 solvability by at least 2 humans (to match AI rules).</li>
    <li>Designed new tasks to challenge AI reasoning systems based on study (symbolic interpretation, compositional reasoning, contextual rules, and more).</li>
</ol>

<p>We've also re-evaluated ARC-AGI-2 against all public AI systems. Here are the starting scores.</p>

</tbody></table>

<p><em>Scores labeled with * are in-progress estimates based on partial results we've been able to aggregate so far and o1-pro pricing. Full results will be published once available.</em></p>

<p>All scores reported pass@2 and on the semi-private eval set (except ARC-AGI-1 human panel and ARChitects, which used public and private eval, respectively).</p>

<p>Human panel efficiency is based upon a $115-150 show-up fee, plus a $5/task solve incentive. We optimized costs to produce show-ups (only 70% of registrations actually showed up). Even though we believe the true limit to human intelligence cost efficiency is likely in the $2-5/task range, we report $17/task to reflect the actual data we collected.</p>

<p>We are looking forward to testing the production version of OpenAI o3 low/high once API access is available. Using ARC-AGI-1 tasks that transferred to ARC-AGI-2, we estimate that o3-low would score ~4% and o3-high would potentially score up to 15-20% with very high compute (thousands of dollars per task).</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="intelligence-is-not-just-capability">Intelligence Is Not Just Capability</h3>

<p>Going forward, all ARC-AGI reporting will come along with an efficiency metric. We are starting with cost because it is the most directly comparable between human and AI performance.</p>

<p>Intelligence is not solely defined by the ability to solve problems or achieve high scores. The efficiency with which those capabilities are acquired and deployed is a crucial, defining component. The core question being asked is not just, "Can AI acquire skill to solve a task?" but also, "At what efficiency or cost?"</p>

  <figcaption>Frontier AI system scores on ARC-AGI-1 vs. ARC-AGI-2</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We know that brute-force search could eventually solve ARC-AGI (given unlimited resources and time to search). This would not represent true intelligence. Intelligence is about finding the solution efficiently, not exhaustively.</p>

<p>This focus on efficiency is a core principle behind the ARC-AGI. We will now explicitly quantify the cost of intelligence, requiring solutions to demonstrate not just capability, but also the efficient use of resources that defines general intelligence.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://arcprize.org/leaderboard">new leaderboard page</a> reports progress along both a score and cost axis.</p>

<p>Alongside ARC-AGI-2, we're excited to announce <a href="https://arcprize.org/competition">ARC Prize 2025 is back</a>! The contest will be again hosted on Kaggle between March and November. The competition goes live later this week, sign up <a href="#" data-modal-id="signup">here</a> to get notified.</p>

<p>There is $125K in guaranteed progress prizes, with an additional $700K Grand Prize (up $100k from last year!) waiting to be unlocked by a solution that scores greater than 85%, as well as $175K to-be-announced prizes.</p>

<p>Unlike the <a href="https://arcprize.org/leaderboard">public leaderboard</a> on arcprize.org, Kaggle rules restrict you from using internet APIs, and you only get ~$50 worth of compute per submission. In order to be eligible for prizes, contestants must open source and share their solution and work into the public domain at the end of the competition.</p>

<p>Last year's competition saw incredible success — over 1,500 teams participated, generating 40 influential research papers. ARC Prize-winning researchers introduced innovations now adopted across the AI industry.</p>

<p>What progress can you unlock and share with the world this year?</p>

<h4 id="prize-categories">Prize Categories</h4>

<p><strong>Grand Prize ($700K)</strong><br>
Unlocked once first team reaches 85% within Kaggles efficiency limits.</p>

<p><strong>Top Score Prize ($75K)</strong><br>
Awarded to the highest-scoring submissions.</p>

<p><strong>Paper Prize ($50K)</strong><br>
Awarded to the submission demonstrating the most significant conceptual progress toward solving ARC-AGI. Papers must be tied to a scored submission, but innovative ideas matter more than achieving a high score.</p>

<p><strong>To-be-announced Prizes ($175k)</strong><br>
More details on these coming during the 2025 competition.</p>

<p>You can find more details on our <a href="https://arcprize.org/competition">Competition page</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://tjmorley.com/blogposts/cottagecoreprogrammers.html">https://tjmorley.com/blogposts/cottagecoreprogrammers.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43464914">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="Essay">
    <p>
    Every programmer I know has at some point longingly expressed how “[they] want to work with [their] hands”. Some say they wish they were a carpenter, some want to be in the fields on a farm, some want to raise chickens, or milk cows. It is however inevitable that I either hear someone say it or agree with it at some point. Often, the sentiment is accompanied by a general dissatisfaction with the impact of the speaker’s work or profession. Maybe someone just got a particularly mind-numbing feature request, or spent several weeks arguing in meetings about several pixels of padding for text on a button on a support page in a single app.
    </p>
    <p>
    One of the first examples that got me to notice this ongoing trend was back around the end of 2020, when a number of my friends shared and commented on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24541964">a hackernews thread</a> about someone who had responded to a request to add an RSS feed to a DBMS with the news that he had quit programming and switched to carpentry, in a particularly pithy manner (as an aside, I took a look at his <a href="https://www.longwalkwoodworking.com/">woodworking shop</a> while writing this up, and it is quite beautiful, you should definitely check it out).
    </p>
    <p><img src="https://tjmorley.com/assets/rss_dbms_github.png" alt="Screenshot of a githhub post saying that the author missed a comment of many months ago because they no longer build software, but instead make furniture out of wood."></p><p>
    Now the relevant part here isn’t necessarily this particular post or person (It seems to me that he really prefers and loves woodworking over software which is of course completely valid, and I honestly understand it in many ways), but the reactions to it, many of which were wistful among people I knew as well as among the comments online. Though there was certainly debate between commenters(see the thread linked earlier if curious). If I had to sum up the reactions, they fell into two camps. It was split between a group who mainly expressed admiration and a desire to be doing similar work, interspersed with condemnations leveled towards modern software practices and businesses, and a second group who mainly saw the flaws in modern development as being similar to those in any other job, or who thought that other jobs were even worse off. My real interest in writing this post is exploring why people – especially tech workers – seem to resonate so strongly with stories such as this one, where other tech workers leave behind their positions to return to work based in crafts, agriculture, or homesteading. This is particularly interesting to me given the seeming stability of this fascination regardless of the economic situation for tech workers (in 2020, the market was quite strong, though there’s been noted layoffs in recent years). In fact, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1bjsan7/i_think_i_get_the_whole_drop_out_of_tech_and_do/">here</a> is another thread on reddit from a year ago referencing the same phenomenon. Another one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/p85p6b/this_guy_actually_did_leave_the_tech_life_to_be_a/?rdt=43971">here</a> I've only looked through the comments of, but many discuss their desire to leave IT for farming. If you aren't a tech worker, trust me in that you will hear people say how much they want this if you are a tech worker.
    </p>
    <p>
    ebd2’s post was just one particularly salient example, but if you’ve been online enough over the last decade or so, you’ve probably seen plenty of these kinds of posts in the same way I have, and not just from software developers or general tech workers. Across tech, it appears that many people are tired of working in offices, with computers, with meetings or emails, and want to abandon this life and start anew in more meaningful labor. In fact, over the last few years, there’s been a noted increase(see <a href="https://fox8.com/news/homesteading-taking-off-in-popularity-particularly-among-younger-generations/">here</a> or <a href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20201208-cottagecore-and-the-rise-of-the-modern-rural-fantasy">here</a>) in a style of content that portrays idyllic lifestyles in times perceived as simpler, especially in short form video content. I can’t help but propose this “cottagecore” type content as deriving from the same zeitgeist.  For popular examples, take a look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nara_Smith">Nara Smith</a> making all sorts of odd things from scratch, or at the popular but ominous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheBallerinaFarm/shorts">ballerina farm</a>, which inspired significant discussion over it’s formation (discussed <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/magazines/the-sunday-times-magazine/article/meet-the-queen-of-the-trad-wives-and-her-eight-children-plfr50cgk">here</a> among other places). If this content is so wildly popular, there’s certainly some form of backlash against modernity and a desire to turn back the clock.
    </p>
    <p>
    After hearing this desire to return to a more hands-on type of labor once again recently, I began to ask myself why it was so common. Why does everyone who sits behind a computer long to be out in the fields or workshops? Is this specific to some subgroup in tech that I happen to cross paths with regularly, or is it a broader modern ennui? To understand why I find the topic so interesting though, you’ll probably require a bit of background on me. I currently work as a researcher in the application of machine learning to problems in healthcare and genetics, but I was raised on a farm in a very rural area of Vermont. My mother’s side of the family have been farmers in the area for generations, generally growing and selling hay, as well as sheep and some amount of dairy farming. As a child on a farm, I of course helped work on the farm – throwing hay bales, carrying water buckets, shoveling massive piles of manure. I also worked in the associated side industries, like basic construction. I appreciate what I learned from this work, and the lessons were deeply valuable ones, but at the same time I would be lying if I didn’t admit that the intensity of it was a serious motivator for me to study harder than I otherwise would have and focus on technical skills, precisely so that I wouldn’t have to do physical labor anymore. I dreamed about the idea of getting paid to sit in an air conditioned office, free of clouds of dust, never having to deal with the constant little cuts and pricks from the blades of dried grass in the air of a hayloft slicing my arms over and over. Personally, I still like gardening, and there are parts of farming I enjoy quite a lot. If I lived in an area with more space, I would likely still farm as a hobby, but having your income or food supply come from it is a very different concept in terms of stress.
    </p>
    <p>
    Considering that, I hope it makes sense as to why I find this trend puzzling. Why would people who are so comfortable, whose job was to me a lifelong goal, want to do exactly what I worked so hard to move away from? I suspect the answer is tied up in the nature of our work in the modern world, as well as in the inspection of who has been mythologized in American history. So we’ll be taking a short departure from the modern day to look into this, if you’ll excuse the seeming change in subject. In the following sections, I’ll largely focus on this from the perspective of farming in terms of verbiage and discussion, but I believe many of these psychological yearnings and trends in the American populace in relation to manual craftsperson or homesteading type work have some similarities.
    </p>
    <h3>The Homesteader within the American Mythos</h3>
    <p>
    Farmers and small landowners in general have been largely lionized in American history, where examples abound of political figures extolling the virtues, necessity of, and unique individualism belonging to farmers. I’ll admit it’s a little flattering when people talk about the sort of work I did for so long as uniquely virtuous, but I’m left feeling unsure as to how healthy it is for a society to degrade some types of work in order to raise up others. For an example, think of William Jennings Bryan, an American politician popular among farmers in the late 19th century and after its turn. He had a large effect on the views of many rural Americans and regularly espoused the idea that agrarian work was inherently superior to other forms of labor. The classic example of his views is his famous “Cross of Gold” speech, where he said the following:
    </p>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5354/">
        “You come to us and tell us that the great cities are in favor of the gold standard. I tell you that the great cities rest upon these broad and fertile prairies. Burn down your cities and leave our farms, and your cities will spring up again as if by magic. But destroy our farms and the grass will grow in the streets of every city in the country.” 
    </blockquote>
    <p><cite>William Jennings Bryan: “<a href="https://www.historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5354/">Cross of Gold” July 9, 1896, Chicago</a></cite></p>
    <p>The idea expressed here is clear – farms power the existence of the cities, so they should be shown more respect.</p>
    <p>
    Stepping back another century, think of Thomas Jefferson. He was arguably the primary supporter for the United States to be an agrarian republic during its founding, through his writings such as “Notes on the State of Virginia.” In mentioning this book, I must note that many viewpoints he expresses in it are clearly and deeply reprehensible, primarily his comments on race, and those on the law. Still, the views of Jefferson were advanced by many in the early days of the United States and he influenced much of the national consciousness, regardless of my opinion on him. Richard Hofstadter, an American historian has written thoroughly on the subject of this phenomenon and its impact on American values. His work includes much discussion of the social establishment of virtues in the United States around agrarianism, with one example being his essay “The Myth of the Happy Yeoman.” In it, he gives an excellent and concise description of the manner in which people such as Jefferson or Bryan argued about the superiority of rural life:
    </p>
    <blockquote cite="">
        “Like any complex of ideas, the agrarian myth cannot be defined in a phrase, but its component themes form a clear pattern. Its hero was the yeoman farmer, its central conception the notion that he is the ideal man and the ideal citizen. Unstinted praise of the special virtues of the farmer and the special values of rural life was coupled with the assertion that agriculture, as a calling uniquely productive and uniquely important to society, had a special right to the concern and protection of government. The yeoman, who owned a small farm and worked it with the aid of his family, was the incarnation of the simple, honest, independent, healthy, happy human being. Because he lived in close communion with beneficent nature, his life was believed to have a wholesomeness and integrity impossible for the depraved populations of cities.”
    </blockquote>
    <p><cite>Richard Hofstadter: “<a href="https://www.americanheritage.com/myth-happy-yeoman">The Myth of the Happy Yeoman</a>”, 1956</cite></p>
    <p>
    To me, this feels almost as if it could have been written today, in description aimed towards the varying videos and posts on social media waxing poetically on the forgotten idyllic lifestyles of life on the farm. Yet this was written almost seventy years ago, about topics which were in heavy discussion more than fifty years prior. Hofstadter even seems to imply in the essay that this ideal of the yeoman had declined, and says that “agrarian myth” was subsumed and replaced by an “even stronger ideal, the notion of opportunity, of career, of the self-made man.” If the agrarian myth declined and was subsumed, why does it seem to be re-energized today? The key here is the ideal of the self-made man, which brings our focus back to the present day. Though I think the feelings of ennui expressed by many tech workers that inspired me to write this are most pronounced in the field of programming, I don’t think they are limited solely to them.
    </p>
    <h3>Psychological Shifts in American Ideals</h3>
    <p>
    My general opinion is that the ideal of the “self-made man” has made a transition from a widely accepted goal to one viewed as contentious, and to many, unrealistic. The average American citizen no longer views stability in this way as a plausible concept, disheartened by <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/01/09/trends-in-income-and-wealth-inequality/">rising income inequality</a> and disillusioned by the proliferation of easily accessed get-rich-quick schemes (with obviously low rates of success) such as cryptocurrency, app-based stock trading within meme stocks, and exploitation of audiences by sudden social media stars. These feelings of despair often center around the idea of homeownership – central to the ideal of the yeoman and of any independent citizen is the idea of owning a residence, and of setting roots in an area. Whether or not owning housing is as achievable as it was in the past in the US is a complicated question – the rate of increase in housing costs has been significantly higher than the rate of increase in average wage over the last <a href="https://www.thezebra.com/resources/home/housing-trends-visualized/">60 years</a>, so housing is unarguably taking up a larger percentage of our income. Though data prior to 1980 on homeownership by age group is harder to come by, it appears that it has not changed dramatically for most groups (the main difference being a slight downward trend and a significant drop during and after the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis for most groups which are not older than age 65, while the 65+ group has over time increased their homeownership rates by about 5%).
    </p>
    <p><img src="https://tjmorley.com/assets/censushousing.png" alt="U.S. Census Bureau Housing and Vacancy survery showing 5 age categories percent homeownership rate remaining relatively stable from 1980s to today, with the only exceptions being those mentioned above."></p><p>
    One could argue, as many have, that some of this increase in housing cost is offset by decreased costs in other expenditures such as food or technology. However, the important point here is not about whether the material reality has effectively changed, but in how individuals currently perceive both the current reality and the past. As recently as two years ago, Americans polled on whether they believe that life for people like now compared to 50 years ago was better or worse generally said that they <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/04/24/americans-take-a-dim-view-of-the-nations-future-look-more-positively-at-the-past/">believed life was now worse.</a> There is a pervasive belief that life was better in the past and I believe that individuals who feel this way tend to move themselves towards social values that they see as indicative of the past, such as agrarian lifestyles. They retreat to an earlier part of the American psyche, to that of the independent farmer, escaping from the confusion and fear they see in a modern economy and impersonality of technology.
    </p>
    <p>
    One counterpoint to this is as follows – if this is prevalent in individuals employed in tech, could it truly be linked to income inequality? Many tech workers enjoy high incomes relative to the average worker in this country. This is true, but it draws us to our next point, that of alienation. This is a topic which is less grounded in surveys or statistics, but one which is more readily understood simply through discussion of how we view the nature of work. Many individuals find satisfaction from being appreciated for what they contribute in their work, a simple enough proposition. However, direct service and interaction with the individuals who benefit from your work is generally not an efficiency within a market. One baker making bread for his neighbors may find more satisfaction in that, but wouldn’t it be more efficient to have a centralized bread distribution factory, staffed by hundreds of bakers, who have their pooled effort in the form of hearty loaves of glutenous manna distributed efficiently across multiple communities? As we create more and more efficient economies across a variety of fields of work, we continually disentangle and alienate individuals from the effects and recipients of their labor. When you become detached from the meaning behind your work in this way though, it becomes difficult to assign meaning to your work.
    </p>
    <p>
    It is difficult to think of any field more forcibly disentangled from any sort of understanding of the impact of your labor than the majority of positions in tech. Through a series of entirely digital processes you are completing tasks which often, upon reflection, feel almost imaginary. Programs pushed through layers of committees work well to distribute responsibility for potential bugs or issues, but they have a secondary effect of  stripping much of the individual ownership of a given product. If you were some engineer working on a large corporate website, it’s less that you made the whole experience, and more that you contributed to it. You likely never see any indication of whether people appreciate or like the things that you made beyond abstract visit rates and click-through statistics, as opposed to a person acknowledging that you created something that they appreciate. Of course people in this position would feel deeply alienated from the work that they do over time, even when they logically understand the economic or personal value of what they create, the emotional connection they seek to find value through work is lacking. This is exactly where it ties back into the rising income inequality though – say you’re a programmer working at a company that you feel is draining your soul. You feel no connection to your work. But what else can you do? You’re fully aware that other careers pay far less, so why would you work in a different position, especially when you’ve already worked your way up the ladder within this one? This choice could feel even worse if you had a family depending on you. So instead many people detach, they start to feel more apathetic and they simply step through the motions. Some others instead start to yearn to turn back the clock to an almost mythical time period that they see depicted in popular media as better. It is exactly this combination of alienation from the meaning of one’s labor, a lack of confidence in the viability of a stable career-driven path to “success” or becoming “self-made” without luck, and a view of craft-based or agricultural labor as existing in a different time period possessing greater intrinsic meaning and inherent nobility which combine together within the American psyche to form a fascination with these types of work across social strata. Idealization of farming seems much more likely now that it almost feels mythical as compared to when most individuals likely either were engaged in it or knew someone who was.
    </p>
    <p><img src="https://tjmorley.com/assets/percent_labor_force_agricultural.png" alt="A chart with percent and year, with percent dropping from ~74% to ~2%-3% from the years 1800 to 2000."></p><p><cite>Image: Percent of the Labor Force Employed in Agriculture, United States, 1800 to 2000. Source: Ruggles, Steven. (2007). The Decline of Intergenerational Coresidence in the United States, 1850 to 2000. American sociological review. 72. 964-989. 10.1177/000312240707200606.</cite></p>
    <p>
    In the above chart, Dr. Ruggles demonstrates as part of his paper on the decline of intergenerational coresidence in the US the astronomical change in the amount of agricultural workers in the country, dropping from it being the occupation of the vast majority of the labor force to only a tiny percent over the last few decades. Importantly, there is now no American alive who remembers the country when more than a 20%-30% of its workers were employed in agriculture. The median American by age, in their late 30s currently, has only ever known a world where a single-digit proportion of the US workforce was working agriculturally.
    </p>
    <p>
    In fact, given these statistics I would take the point of these sort of agrarian type jobs seeming mythical a step further, given that so few Americans are familiar with the actual work behind jobs in the agricultural sector or related ones, I would argue that for many Americans the reality of this type of work is almost indistinguishable from fables or myth in their psychological context, due to lack of exposure. Due to that seeming separation from their mental context of what work is, it enhances the feeling of escapism which this work-fantasy provides, though the conception many hold of it is even more accurately described as a fable due to the significant difference between reality and the projection which many seem to aim for in their cottagecore fantasy. Certainly on Instagram or TikTok you can find depictions of women waltzing through their gardens, baby in their arms, cheery-faced while their husband walks around with flannel and chops wood and their goats bleat in the distance and a chicken pecks in the yard. This idyllic view certainly leaves out the part where she has to take a pick and scrape dirt and feces out of those goats hooves and trim them on a regular basis to prevent foot-rot (They certainly didn’t evolve to walk in dirt all day, but to jump around on rocks). It doesn’t touch on when they hadn’t realized that they had too high a rooster hen ratio, and woke up to find one rooster pulling the eyes of another one out of its skull. It certainly doesn’t display the economic difficulties inherent in these agricultural endeavors: checking your fruit trees and seeing half your apples have one large bite out of them from deer, looking in your coop and seeing that several of your hens got dragged off by foxes or coyotes, having one of your prime dairy cows die due to complications after a stillbirth, going to water your large tomato crop and finding that blister beetles have started stripping all the foliage from your plants. The possibilities are endless and the situations are often dirty and difficult, and while for a hobby farm these are just unfortunate setbacks, if your ability to put food on the table for your family is determined by the outcome of these sort of situations, then they’re less of a setback and more of a devastating blow to whether or not you can remain economically solvent.
    </p>
    <p>
    The idealization of farmers and craftsmen is not unique to the USA either(see Tolstoy’s opinions on agrarianism as well), but I can primarily speak to how people feel about the current climate of work within our country. I will say that I think many people yearning to turn back many changes in society are largely misguided in this – though there is absolutely value in hands on work, in serving one’s community, turning back the clock in all aspects risks erasing so many true gains we’ve made as a society, especially if the core of the issue is in our relationship with work as a society. Personally, I can’t deny that seeing someone doing work with their own two hands feels more authentic and true to me. I find the idea of others in my field who have never experienced physical labor very strange to consider. There is a clear flaw with some of this idealization though. The ideal of finding our value in work and making something of ourselves through the sweat of our brow is a noble one in many ways but contains a corrosive core as well. If you center your value entirely in how appreciative others are of the contributions you make, and in what you can provide, you ignore the actual concept of community, and you potentially build a worldview that denigrates those who you view as not contributing “enough” in your manner. This is purely my opinion, but I think the healthier way to approach this concept is one of sacrifice and service. If you have the capability to contribute work in some way – physical strength, knowledge, or mental acuity, then you have a moral responsibility to do so – yet not having as much capability as some other person is not something that should negate your self-worth. Instead, the act of doing what you can is what should be seen as virtuous, rather than the absolute economic output of your personal capability. Do what you can, build a community through simple acts of socialization and giving to others, and improve the lives of everyone around you. That is how we find fulfillment in a world such as this one.

<a href="https://discord.gg/yPEP2vHTu4" target="_blank">DISCORD</a></p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>At the end of January this year, we launched the Qwen2.5-VL series of models, which received widespread attention and positive feedback from the community. Building on the Qwen2.5-VL series, we continued to optimize the model using reinforcement learning and open-sourced the new VL model with the beloved 32B parameter scale under the Apache 2.0 license — <strong>Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct</strong>. Compared to the previously released Qwen2.5-VL series models, the features of this 32B VL model are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Responses More Aligned with Human Preferences</strong>: Adjusted the output style to provide more detailed, better-formatted answers that align more closely with human preferences.</li><li><strong>Mathematical Reasoning</strong>: Significant improvement in the accuracy of solving complex mathematical problems.</li><li><strong>Fine-grained Image Understanding and Reasoning</strong>: Enhanced accuracy and detailed analysis in tasks such as image parsing, content recognition, and visual logic deduction.</li></ul><h2 id="performance">Performance</h2><p>Extensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art (SoTA) models of comparable scale, <strong>Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct</strong> has demonstrated superiority over baselines, e.g., Mistral-Small-3.1-24B and Gemma-3-27B-IT, even surpassing the larger <strong>Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct</strong>. Notably, it achieves significant advantages in multimodal tasks such as <strong>MMMU</strong>, <strong>MMMU-Pro</strong>, and <strong>MathVista</strong>, which focus on complex, multi-step reasoning. On <strong>MM-MT-Bench</strong>, a benchmark emphasizing subjective user experience evaluation, <strong>Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct</strong> outperforms its predecessor <strong>Qwen2-VL-72B-Instruct</strong> by a substantial margin.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-VL-32B/qwen2.5vl-32b-vision.jpg" width="100%"></figure><p>In addition to excelling in visual capabilities, Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct has also achieved top-tier performance in pure text capabilities at the same scale.</p><figure><img src="https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen2.5-VL-32B/qwen2.5vl-32b-text.jpg" width="100%"></figure><h2 id="demo-cases">Demo Cases</h2><div><p><span>Fine-grained Image Understanding and Reasoning</span>

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]
Given:</p><ul><li>Distance = 110 km</li><li>Maximum Speed = 100 km/h</li></ul><p>Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{110 \text{ km}}{100 \text{ km/h}} = 1.1 \text{ hours}
\]</p><h4 id="2-convert-time-to-hours-and-minutes">2. <strong>Convert Time to Hours and Minutes</strong></h4><p>1.1 hours is equivalent to:
\[
1 \text{ hour} + 0.1 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 1 \text{ hour} + 6 \text{ minutes} = 1 \text{ hour and } 6 \text{ minutes}
\]</p><h4 id="3-determine-arrival-time">3. <strong>Determine Arrival Time</strong></h4><p>If you start at 12:00 and it takes 1 hour and 6 minutes to travel 110 kilometers, your arrival time will be:
\[
12:00 + 1 \text{ hour and } 6 \text{ minutes} = 13:06
\]</p><h4 id="4-compare-with-target-time">4. <strong>Compare with Target Time</strong></h4><p>You want to arrive before 13:00. However, based on the calculations, you will arrive at 13:06, which is <strong>after</strong> 13:00.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h3><p>Given the speed limit of 100 km/h for trucks, it is <strong>not possible</strong> to reach a place 110 kilometers away before 13:00.</p><p>Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\text{No}}
\]</p></div></div></div><h2 id="next-step">Next Step</h2><p>While <strong>Qwen2.5-VL-32B</strong> has focused on optimizing subjective experience and mathematical reasoning through reinforcement learning—operating within the paradigm of <strong>“fast thinking”</strong>. Our next research direction will prioritize <strong>long and effective reasoning processes</strong> to push the boundaries of visual models in tackling highly complex, multi-step visual reasoning tasks.</p><h2 id="citation">Citation</h2><p>If you find our model helpful, feel free to cite it:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>@article{Qwen2.5-VL,
