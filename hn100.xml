<p>LLM and AI companies seem to all be in a race to
<a href="https://drewdevault.com/2025/03/17/2025-03-17-Stop-externalizing-your-costs-on-me.html">breathe the last breath of air</a> in every room
they stumble into. This practice started with larger
websites, ones that already had protection from
malicious usage like denial-of-service and abuse in the form
of services like Cloudflare or Fastly.</p>

<p>But the list of targets has been getting longer.
At this point we're seeing LLM and AI scrapers
<a href="https://thelibre.news/foss-infrastructure-is-under-attack-by-ai-companies/">targeting small project forges</a> like the <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME">GNOME GitLab server</a>.</p>

<p>How long until scrapers start hammering Mastodon servers? Individual websites?
Are we going to have to require authentication or JavaScript challenges on
every web page from here on out?</p>

<p>All this for what, shitty chat bots? What an awful thing that these companies are
doing to the web.</p>

<p>I suggest everyone that uses cloud infrastructure for hosting set-up
a billing limit to avoid an unexpected bill in case they're
caught in the cross-hairs of a negligent company.
All the abusers anonymize their usage at this point, so good luck trying to
get compensated for damages.</p>

      <div id="home" role="tabpanel">
        <p>Welcome to the home of <b>ACARS Drama</b>, the leading provider of aircraft based drama ingestion services.</p>
        
        <p>This small companion website is designed to provide a brief overview of the ACARS Drama project, along with some code snippets and other information regarding the project, and how you can contribute.</p>
        
        <p>The latest drama ingested is shown below:</p>
        <!-- Embedded Mastodon Feed -->

        <h2>A project to map out every broken coffee maker in the sky</h2>
        <!-- The existing content for the What tab starts here -->
        <p>A question I’ve been asked a few times since I took a little project I had for a year or so operating privately under my desk, and turned it into a social media bot.</p>
  
        <p>Note: this post is designed as a more high-level overview of what ACARS/VDLM2 messages are, and what my bot they feed is. So, if you’re looking for a more detailed technical overview of how the bot works, check out <a href="https://mike-sheward.medium.com/slack-messages-from-the-skies-9ea8ea9366f0">this earlier post from when it was first created as a Slack app</a>.</p>
  
        <p>When an aircraft is flying overhead, various radio signals are being transmitted and received by said aircraft constantly. Some examples of the radio signals, of course, are voice communications between pilots and air traffic controllers, that most people are familiar with. These are, of course, critical for safety, and ensuring planes are at the right altitude, going in the right direction, and at the right speed.</p>
  
        <p>In addition to voice, there are also a boat-load, well, plane-load I guess, of data signals. Amongst these data signals are the two types of signal that feed the bot’s insatiable thirst for drama. They are ACARS and VDLM2.</p>
  
        <p><strong>ACARS</strong>, which stands for Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, is a 1970’s era protocol that is still used today. A bunch of ground stations around the world are used to translate messages between computers in dispatch, maintenance and operations control rooms of the various airlines and their aircraft, and vice-versa, from the aircraft cockpit back to those airline computers.</p>
  
        <p><strong>VDLM2</strong>, which stands for VHF Data Link Mode 2, is similar in that it is a data transmission protocol that works over very high frequency (VHF) radio-waves, but it’s a bit more modern, uses different frequencies, is a bit faster, and can also carry ACARS messages.</p>
  
        <p>So, in summary, ACARS is where the drama usually is, sometimes transmitted in raw ACARS form, other times it is encapsulated in VDLM2. Same result all round really, you just have to look in a slightly different place to decode the ACARS inside of VDLM2 messages.</p>
  
        <p>Because I am a massive nerd when it comes to both radio stuff and planes (I was a PPL, almost did commercial but got rejected by the flight school I wanted to train at age 17 because I was ‘too quiet’, a problem I later rectified), I was able to buy a few relatively cheap bits of equipment that can listen for these signals from planes flying over my house, and using some open source software that other, much smarter people than me wrote, I was able to decode them. I then wrote some extra bits of software that fixes up the message (extracts only the human readable interesting bits, removes bad formatting etc), and turns it into the posts you see on ACARS Drama. That software also does the job of finding the aircraft photo and adding the tracking link too.</p>
  
        <p>Below is an image of an FMC from a cockpit:</p>
        <p><img src="https://acarsdrama.com/fmc.webp" alt="An FMC from a cockpit— source http://www.b737.org.uk/fmc.htm"></p><p>Now, because of how the system works, it is extremely hard to capture the ground to air signals, unless you live in close proximity to an airport or ground station, which I do not. So this means that pretty much 99% of what you see on ACARS Drama is air to ground. Essentially one side of a conversation, from the plane to folks on the ground. Sometimes it picks up ground to air, but it’s rare, and I honestly don’t know why it works when it does. If you do see a ground to air message, the bot will say “ACARS Message To” instead of “ACARS Message From”.</p>
  
        <p>Because of the sheer volume of the messages it picks up, around 2,000 an hour, most of which are just position and weather data, and automated readings from equipment, it would not be reasonable to post them all via the bot. That would just be annoying. So, I have carefully curated a list of keywords that the bot looks for in the messages received, to ensure that it only shares the ones with human-entered, “free-text” content. So when you see a message on the bot, it means that a pilot or crew member on the aircraft typed that into their ACARS terminal, which is usually a Flight Management Computer (FMC) device, like the one shown above.</p>
  
        <p>As a message is typed and sent via ACARS, if that plane is in range of one of my antennas (there are two currently being used for the ACARS drama bot), and on a frequency I’m monitoring (I currently monitor five total — 3 ACARS and 2 VDLM2), then it’ll be processed by my software and turned into the bot post that you see on Masto like this:</p>
  
        <p><img src="https://acarsdrama.com/example.webp" alt="Example image showing ACARS message details"></p><p>In this example, the message was captured in a VDLM2 frequency. The transmitting aircraft registration was N305SY, and its flight number was OO3682. OO is the code for Skywest Airlines, and N305SY is an Embraer 175 aircraft. The Track Aircraft link in the bot points to the registration, so you can see where in the sky the plane is at any given time, unless it’s on the ground of course.</p>
  
        <p>It’s fair to say that the overwhelming majority of messages transmitted are extremely routine and boring, contrary to the name of the bot — which to be honest, is part of the joke. So, you’ll mostly see things about asking for gate confirmations, reporting “snags” with the aircraft, usually toilet or coffee maker related, but occasionally you’ll see reports of drunk passengers, fights onboard — you know, air travel things. That’s what makes it an interesting and fun project. You also get to see the pilots’ personalities shine through as well, which I love. We all have good days and bad days at work, so you might see the occasional snarky message — but ultimately, these are professionals doing a wonderful job in not always the easiest of circumstances.</p>
  
        <p>So that’s what you’re seeing and how the bot works. You can follow along at <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@acarsdrama">https://infosec.exchange/@acarsdrama</a> if you aren’t already.</p>  </div>

        <h2>Harvest your sky drama!</h2>
        <p>If you would like to contribute to ACARS Drama, we'd love to have you! It's very easy to get started, all you need is a $30 SDR (like an RTL-SDR), an antenna, some open source software, and Internet access. This is how:</p>
        
        <h3>Quick Start</h3>
        <p>If you already have an instance of <b>acarsdec, dumpvdlm2, or acars_router</b> running, then all you need to do is include our ingestion endpoint in your configuration.</p>
        
        <p>Send <b>ACARS</b> messages to: <b>feedthe.acarsdrama.com:5550</b></p>
        <p>Send <b>VDLM2</b> messages to: <b>feedthe.acarsdrama.com:5555</b></p>
        <p>The connection can be either UDP or TCP (UDP is preferred), and should be in JSON format (the default for the three tools mentioned above).</p>
        <p>acars_router is required to be able to send acarsdec/dumpvdlm2 traffic to multiple servers, so if you are already feeding elsewhere directly from acarsdec or dumpvdlm2, you will need to introduce an acars_router instance in your pipeline to continue to feed both.</p>
        <p>If you do start feeding, be sure to DM @acarsdrama@infosec.exchange, and let us know where you are!</p>
        <h3>Need a bit more guidance?</h3>
        <p>For information about running your own acarsdec, dumpvdlm2 and acars_router containers, have a read through <a href="https://mike-sheward.medium.com/slack-messages-from-the-skies-9ea8ea9366f0">this earlier post</a>, but remember you only need to do the container bit.</p>
        
        <p>Check out our <a href="https://github.com/msheward287/acars-drama-feeder-configs/blob/main/docker-compose.yml" target="_blank">sample config on Github</a> for an example of how you can set up a minimal container setup to feed the drama engine.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><main><div id="article-body"><div><div><p><span>Every day, for most of her life, Norma, a 68-year-old woman from the outskirts of Mexico City, has struggled to get something that many of us take for granted: drinking water.</span></p>

<p><span>She draws water from a well in her patio in Ecatepec, but it’s not fit for drinking. She can, however, use it for filling toilets, cleaning, or laundry. The water is unfiltered, she says, and it has caused her skin problems. </span></p></div><div><p><img alt="Norma, 68 years old, collects unfiltered, nonpotable water from a well in her yard in Ecatepec, Mexico, May 9, 2024." loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1921" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-1-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-1-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><span></span></p><p><span>Norma, 68 years old, collects unfiltered, nonpotable water from a well in her yard in Ecatepec, Mexico, May 9, 2024.
</span></p></div><div><p><span>Though Norma is a widow, she is not alone. As Mexico City continues to expand while resources become scarce, its water crisis impacts millions. It exemplifies a future that cities worldwide could face if global warming and overpopulation continue. From springs that have been sealed or pipelined to rainwater that goes unused and into the drain, to drinking water that gets polluted or spilled on its way into homes across the megalopolis, many issues have created this crisis.</span></p>

<p><span>Norma lives by herself in a small house, which is sinking — another byproduct of the Mexican capital’s unquenchable thirst for water. According to Norma, the bedroom has already descended 20 inches below ground level. She feels constantly under stress, not just from poverty but also from the criminal groups prowling around her neighborhood. She refuses to provide her last name for this report, fearing retaliation.</span></p></div></div><div><div><p><span>Two hours away from Mexico’s capital, the water reservoir at the town of Valle de Bravo collects most of its water from nearby rivers and springs and is the main source for the Cutzamala water system. This system provides more than a quarter of Mexico City’s drinking water.</span></p>

<p><span>A complex network of about 45 miles of canals, 26 miles of tunnels, and six siphons, the Cutzamala system also has six pumping stations, 11 dams, 10 reservoirs, a major treatment plant, two storage reservoirs, and four storage reservoirs at the Mexico City terminal. Despite its complexity and engineering, it’s one of the key pivots in the city’s water crisis.</span></p></div><div><p><img alt="A tower at the reservoir at Valle de Bravo shows water stains, marking where the water had previously been much higher." loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1921" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-2-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-2-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><span></span></p><p><span>The main reservoir at Valle de Bravo on May 8, 2024. That month, it was at its lowest level ever: 30% capacity. Water stains and markings note the reservoir’s various levels over the years. 
</span></p></div><div><p><span>Prolonged overuse is one reason the lake has been so critically affected by drought. Agricultural demands, local consumption, and the city’s water needs have stretched its resources to a breaking point. Climate change has further exacerbated the situation, with erratic rainfall and extended dry seasons making it increasingly difficult to replenish the lake and ensure water stability.</span></p>

<p><span>The water scarcity has fueled social tensions as the Valle de Bravo community struggles to balance its own needs with the obligation to share water with Mexico City. In 2024, the town faced severe challenges due to dwindling water levels, and residents have had to adopt water-saving policies during drought seasons. They have also pushed the government to monitor the illegal diversion of creeks and rivers to wealthy, private properties and the building of unauthorized, restricted lagoons.</span></p></div><div><p><img alt="The Cutzamala system, which provides water to Mexico City from the Cutzamala River, is seen with a drying reservoir." loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1921" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-3-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-3-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><span></span></p><p><span>The Cutzamala system is a complex interbasin transfer network built in three stages, from the late 1970s to 1994, to supply water from the Cutzamala River to the Mexico City metropolitan area, May 8, 2024.
</span></p></div><div><p><span>This crisis has also disrupted tourism, a cornerstone of the local economy. The reservoir lake has experienced some of the lowest levels in its history, making it harder for visitors to enjoy popular water sports in the area, such as skiing, flyboarding, paddle surfing, kayaking, sailing, and fishing. Angered Valle de Bravo inhabitants are pressuring authorities to regulate water usage for swimming pools on properties used mostly by tourists and property owners from big cities who vacation there. </span></p></div><div><div><p><img alt="A water pipe of the Cutzamala water system, May 8, 2024." loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1921" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-4-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-4-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><span></span></p><p><span>A water pipe of the Cutzamala water system, May 8, 2024.

</span></p></div></div><div><p><span>Following months of severe drought in 2024, the late arrival of seasonal rains and emergency conservation measures such as localized rainwater harvesting brought some relief. The Cutzamala reservoir’s capacity increased to 67% in November 2024, up from 30% in May, according to data from Mexico’s National Water Commission. Government actions, including water rationing in Mexico City, likely contributed to this recovery. This increased capacity also provided temporary relief to the capital, which saw more consistent water distribution and fewer interruptions for urban areas. By February 2025, the reserve registered levels close to 61% of its capacity, which is still below the average levels of 72.3%, according to Valle de Bravo’s local water authorities. </span></p></div><div id="video-block-1047634905"><p><span>The Cutzamala pumping system provides much of the drinking water to Mexico City, May 8, 2024.</span><span>Video by Alan Yàñez</span></p></div><div><p><span>In addition, wildfires have become an increasing threat to the area. In May 2024, several fires severely affected Valle de Bravo’s surrounding protected natural forests.</span></p>

<p><span>But the recovering water levels have not fully addressed concerns by communities around the reservoir, including Valle de Bravo, about resource depletion and inequitable water distribution. Residents remain wary of government priorities that seem to favor urban supply and wealthy real estate investors over the needs of local residents. And without sustainable practices and investments in the area’s water systems, the cycle of scarcity will persist, continuing to threaten livelihoods and lives.</span></p></div><div><p><img alt="Several pumping engines at the beginning of the Cutzamala system, May 8, 2024." loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1921" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-8-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-8-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><span></span></p><p><span>Several pumping engines at the beginning of the Cutzamala system, May 8, 2024.
</span></p></div></div><div><div><p><span>Mexico City was built on top of what used to be a large body of water, which would make its water shortage appear ironic if it wasn’t so tragic. In the early 1300s, the Mexica (or Aztecs) settled on an island in the middle of what used to be a huge lake called Texcoco, the largest among five intertwined lakes.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>But after the arrival of the Spaniards, the city started to expand, and the urban sprawl caused the lake system to dry up. By the early 20th century, the rivers feeding the once-rich lake zone were put into pipelines to make way for motor vehicles. Very little is left of the lakes, while the rivers have become practically invisible.</span></p></div><div><div><p><img alt="A “pipero” — a tanker truck driver who distributes drinking water to neighborhoods where it is in short supply — jumps from a tanker truck, May 27, 2024." loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1921" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-11-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-11-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><span></span></p><p><span>A “pipero” — a tanker truck driver who distributes drinking water to neighborhoods where it is in short supply — jumps from a tanker truck, May 27, 2024.

</span></p></div></div><div><p><span>Groundwater, depleted by decades of overexploitation, along with the soft soil that used to be the lake bed, can no longer support the megalopolis. The sections of the city built on top of where the lakes used to be are literally sinking under their own weight.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The city’s sinking also causes major water leaks and spills, as underground pipelines fracture. Seismic activity, common in Mexico City, worsens the situation. Research from Mexico’s National Autonomous University indicates that 40% of Mexico City’s water is lost due to these spills.</span></p>

<p><span>“The settlement and historical development of this huge city, since pre-Columbian times, is in a closed basin on the bed of a lake,” says Hilda Hesselbach, a consultant for international development agencies in Mexico and a biologist specializing in nature conservation issues, including water preservation. “So, among the main problems of the water crisis come floods and, in part, differential sinking of the city due to compression of the ground.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>This is particularly evident in Mexico City’s historic downtown, where buildings and avenues buckle and tilt as they descend into the unstable soil. It also extends to nearby areas like the working-class suburbs of Ecatepec, where the problem is as glaringly obvious as Norma’s sunken bedroom.</span></p></div><div><div><p><img alt="A young boy helps his father fill a can of water that he has just drawn from a manhole in the street, May 27, 2024." loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1708" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-13-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-13-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><span></span></p><p><span>A young boy helps his father fill a can of water that he has just drawn from a manhole in the street, May 27, 2024.

</span></p></div></div><div><p><span>During Ecatepec’s tough drought seasons, taps run dry and running water becomes unavailable in the most impoverished areas, where residents draw water from public manholes and carry it away in plastic jerricans. But the area does get a significant amount of rain throughout the year (between 23 and 47 inches per annum), which is why nearly three-quarters of Mexico City’s water comes from </span><span>underground wells and springs. “But since there has not been any real urban planning based on water, many of these groundwater recharge areas have been sealed off as a result of urban growth,” Hesselbach says.</span></p>

<p><span>“It’s an inefficient, not to say absurd, water management scheme,” she adds, citing poor administrative and planning systems with no effective current regulations.

Residents in some of Mexico City’s poorest neighborhoods have complained of being victimized by “huachicoleros,” a term usually used to describe people who steal gasoline for resale on the black market. Now this practice has extended to drinking water.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Taking advantage of the authorities’ lack of supervision, criminal groups steal water from public wells and pipes to sell it to local residents. This illicit trade is becoming increasingly profitable as droughts and infrastructure problems worsen.</span></p></div></div><div><div><p><span>A few miles north of Mexico City, Zumpango Lagoon, one of the few remnants of Lake Texcoco, was a popular local tourist destination until just a few years ago. But the lack of rain has seriously affected the water level, causing a significant reduction in its surface area. Once vibrant and full of activity, the lagoon went into a state of desolation. By March 2024, it had practically disappeared.</span></p></div><div><p><img alt="A resort for families had begun to be built around the Zumpango Lagoon, May 10, 2024." loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1708" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-19-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-19-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><span></span></p><p><span>A resort for families had begun to be built around the Zumpango Lagoon, May 10, 2024.

<p><span>But for some experts, solutions exist. Better wastewater treatment could increase supply and reduce pollution. Rainwater harvesting systems could cut residents’ dependence on water trucks. Fixing leaks from the system could improve efficiency and reduce aquifer extraction.

<p><span>By September 2024, Zumpango registered encouraging water levels, recovering 65% of its full capacity.

</span></p></div></div><div><p><span>To reach the floating agricultural plots, one must cross their polluted surroundings with chaotic concrete sprawl and relentless traffic before venturing down the canals. Urban expansion and low farming incomes force some to abandon these traditional practices for more profitable ventures, like converting chinampas into residential plots.</span></p>

<p><span>“Today this vital agro-ecosystem is at serious risk. Urban pressure, abandonment, pollution, and the industrialization of the food system have led to only 20% of the 2,215 hectares (5,470 acres) of chinampas being actively cultivated,” says Hernández.</span><span></span></p>



<p><span>Preserving the chinampas is vital — not only for their cultural heritage but also for their role in supporting local biodiversity and regulating the urban climate. The gardens are home to one of Mexico’s richest hubs of biodiversity, including the most iconic species of Xochimilco, the</span> <span>axolotl</span><b>,</b><span> an endemic amphibian once abundant here. Today it is critically endangered, threatened by urban pressure, the destruction of chinampas, water shortages, climate warming, and pesticide contamination.</span></p>

<p><span>Local and international organizations like Arca Tierra fight to save this ecosystem and make it sustainable. Since 2009, this nonprofit has worked to ensure sustainability by supporting small-scale farmers socially, ecologically, and economically. It implements agroforestry techniques in Xochimilco to restore soil health and biodiversity, while improving water management by reducing evaporation and improving water retention.</span></p></div><div><p><img alt="A farmer plowing a field with his horse in the Amecameca region, March 14, 2018." loading="lazy" width="2560" height="945" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-36-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://mexicocitywater.longlead.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-36-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><span></span></p><p><span>A farmer plowing a field with his horse in the Amecameca region, March 14, 2018.
</span></p></div><div><p><span>Hernández says her organization envisions a day when chinampas will be appreciated as solutions rather than relics of the past. She says that by replicating their principles to address modern environmental challenges, wetland agriculture can help cities adapt to water scarcity and ensure local food security.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>“Chinampas are a living example of how human intervention can be a force for good, fostering life and biodiversity. While it is often said that humans are the worst thing that has happened to the planet, Xochimilco proves otherwise. This system demonstrates that when we step away from centering ourselves in everything we can regenerate the world around us,” Hernández says.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>“However, its future depends on collective action — from government agencies, private businesses, NGOs, and citizens alike,” she adds.</span></p></div></div></div></main></div></div>]]></description>

And all of the time you spend arguing about it is wasted energy.</p><p>I will die on this hill.</p><p>If your product is still around in 5 years, you’re doing great and you should feel successful. But guess what? Whatever framework you choose will be obsolete in 5 years. That’s just how the frontend community has been operating, and I don’t expect it to change soon. Even the popular frameworks that are still around are completely different. Because change is the name of the game. So they’re gonna rewrite their shit too and just give it a new version number.</p><p>Product teams that are smart are getting off the treadmill. Whatever framework you currently have, start investing in getting to know it deeply. Learn the tools until they are not an impediment to your progress. That’s the only option. Replacing it with a shiny new tool is a trap.</p><p>I also wanna give a piece of candid advice to engineers who are searching for jobs. If you feel strongly about what framework you want to use, please make that a criteria for your job search. Please stop walking into teams and derailing everything by trying to convince them to switch from framework X to your framework of choice. It’s really annoying and tremendously costly.</p><p>I always have to start with the cynical take. It’s just how I am. But I do want to talk about what I think should be happening instead.</p><p>Companies that want to reduce the cost of their frontend tech becoming obsoleted so often should be looking to get back to fundamentals. Your teams should be working closer to the web platform with a lot less complex abstractions. We need to relearn what the web is capable of and go back to that.</p><p>Let’s be clear, I’m not suggesting this is strictly better and the answer to all of your problems. I’m suggesting this as an intentional business tradeoff that I think provides more value and is less costly in the long run. I believe if you stick closer to core web technologies, you’ll be better able to hire capable engineers in the future without them convincing you they can’t do work without rewriting millions of lines of code.</p><p>And if you’re an engineer, you will be able to retain much higher market value over time if you dig into and understand core web technologies. I was here before react, and I’ll be here after it dies. You may trade some job marketability today. But it does a lot more for career longevity than trying to learn every new thing that gets popular. And you see how quickly they discarded us when the market turned anyway. Knowing certain tech won’t save you from those realities.</p><p>I couldn’t speak this candidly about this stuff when I held a management role. People can’t help but question my motivations and whatever agenda I may be pushing. Either that or I get into a lot of trouble with my internal team because they think I’m talking about them. But this is just what I’ve seen play out after doing this for 20+ years. And I feel like we need to be able to speak plainly.</p><p>This has been brewing in my head for a long time. The frontend ecosystem is kind of broken right now. And it’s frustrating to me for a few different reasons. New developers are having an extremely hard time learning enough skills to be gainfully employed. They are drowning in this complex garbage and feeling really disheartened. As a result, companies are finding it more difficult to do basic hiring. The bar is so high just to get a regular dev job. And everybody loses.</p><p>What’s even worse is that I believe a lot of this energy is wasted. People that are learning the current tech ecosystem are absolutely not learning web fundamentals. They are too abstracted away. And when the stack changes again, these folks are going to be at a serious disadvantage when they have to adapt away from what they learned. It’s a deep disservice to people’s professional careers, and it’s going to cause a lot of heartache later.</p><p>On a more personal note, this is frustrating to me because I think it’s a big part of why we’re seeing the web stagnate so much. I still run into lots of devs who are creative and enthusiastic about building cool things. They just can’t. They are trying and failing because the tools being recommended to them are just not approachable enough. And at the same time, they’re being convinced that learning fundamentals is a waste of time because it’s so different from what everybody is talking about.</p><p>I guess I want to close by stating my biases. I’m a web guy. I’ve been bullish on the web for 20+ years, and I will continue to be. I think it is an extremely capable and unique platform for delivering software. And it has only gotten better over time while retaining an incredible level of backwards compatibility. The underlying tools we have are dope now. But our current framework layer is working against the grain instead of embracing the platform.</p><blockquote><p>This is from <a href="https://social.polotek.net/@polotek/112617458589147547">a recent thread I wrote on mastodon</a>.

Solar PV was invented in the 1950s, and began to be used in appreciable volumes for utility-scale electricity generation in the US in the early 2000s, but only around the 2010s did it start to become a large share of planned generation projects worldwide.</p><p><span>Since then, solar generation capacity has grown incredibly quickly. By some metrics, solar PV has been deployed faster than any other energy source in history, going from 100 terawatt-hours of generation to 1,000 terawatt-hours in just 8 years, compared to 12 years for wind and nuclear, 28 for natural gas, and 32 for coal. In the US, solar PV projects are by far the largest share of planned new electrical generation capacity.

As of 2023, solar made up around </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/electricity-in-the-us-generation-capacity-and-sales.php#:~:text=Solar%20energy's%20share%20of%20total,less%20than%200.1%25%20in%201990." rel="">4% of overall electricity generation</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/energy-cheat-sheet" rel="">less than 1% of total US energy production</a><span>. That means that the main questions around solar PV are about its potential: how long can its rapid growth rate continue, and how large a fraction of our energy can it effectively supply?</span></p><p><span>The answer to this question is shaped by two salient facts about solar power. First, the cost of it has fallen precipitously over time. Since its invention in the 1950s, the cost of solar PV has fallen by a factor of </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-did-solar-power-get-cheap-part" rel="">close to 10,000</a><span>.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-159434840" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/understanding-solar-energy#footnote-1-159434840" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> In the last 10 years alone, the cost of solar PV cells has fallen by more than 50%, and they’re projected to get even cheaper. This has made solar PV one of the </span><a href="https://www.lazard.com/media/xemfey0k/lazards-lcoeplus-june-2024-_vf.pdf" rel="">cheapest methods of electricity generation</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The second salient fact about solar PV is that it can’t generate electricity on demand. Unlike technologies that generate energy by burning fuel which can be turned off and on as needed (such as gas, coal, nuclear), solar is intermittent, and only generates power when the sun is shining.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-159434840" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/understanding-solar-energy#footnote-2-159434840" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span></p><p>The future potential of solar power is, broadly, a function of these two factors. Some folks think that solar’s intermittency will fundamentally limit how much of our energy it can supply. Therefore, they believe, we should deemphasize solar in favor of “firm” sources of energy like gas turbines, next-generation nuclear or advanced geothermal. Others argue that solar PV and storage batteries will get so cheap that its intermittency will become less and less of a factor: the cheaper it is to build, the more you can address solar’s intermittency by simply building more panels and storage to compensate.</p><p>While it’s hard to predict the future, some simple modeling seems to favor the second outcome. Supplying a large fraction of energy consumption purely on solar power does indeed require a large degree of “overbuilding”: that is, building solar PV and storage capacity greatly in excess of day to day energy consumption. But even with this overbuilding, it won’t take much progress in solar and storage costs for solar to be as cheap or cheaper than today’s electricity, even at very large fractions of electricity consumption.</p><p><span>Solar panels work by converting light from the sun into electricity. A slightly more detailed explanation is available at my </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-did-solar-power-get-cheap-part" rel="">previous essay about solar power</a><span>, but briefly, solar panels consist of semiconductor components called </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%E2%80%93n_junction" rel="">p-n junctions</a><span>. When light strikes the p-n junction, it excites electrons, which get pushed to one side of the p-n junction by an electric field within it, leaving electron holes on the other side. Connect the two sides of the junction via wire, and electricity will flow as the electrons try to reestablish equilibrium.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba3fe7ef-1c3a-4a90-a0ed-1aba7c4c7d7c_536x515.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba3fe7ef-1c3a-4a90-a0ed-1aba7c4c7d7c_536x515.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba3fe7ef-1c3a-4a90-a0ed-1aba7c4c7d7c_536x515.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba3fe7ef-1c3a-4a90-a0ed-1aba7c4c7d7c_536x515.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba3fe7ef-1c3a-4a90-a0ed-1aba7c4c7d7c_536x515.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba3fe7ef-1c3a-4a90-a0ed-1aba7c4c7d7c_536x515.png" width="536" height="515" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ba3fe7ef-1c3a-4a90-a0ed-1aba7c4c7d7c_536x515.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:515,&quot;width&quot;:536,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba3fe7ef-1c3a-4a90-a0ed-1aba7c4c7d7c_536x515.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba3fe7ef-1c3a-4a90-a0ed-1aba7c4c7d7c_536x515.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba3fe7ef-1c3a-4a90-a0ed-1aba7c4c7d7c_536x515.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba3fe7ef-1c3a-4a90-a0ed-1aba7c4c7d7c_536x515.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>Solar PV cell diagram, via </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/solar/photovoltaics-and-electricity.php" rel="">EIA</a><span>.</span></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Different types of solar panels will have different conversion efficiencies (the fraction of solar energy converted into electrical energy), but utility-scale panels in the US are generally 20–23% efficient. The more intense the light, the more power the panel will produce. On Earth, sunlight reaches the top of the atmosphere with an </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiance" rel="">irradiance</a><span> of 1,360 watts per square meter, but this gets attenuated as it travels through the air, and at Earth’s surface irradiance is about </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_irradiance#On_Earth's_surface" rel="">1,000 watts (1 kilowatt) per square meter</a><span> when the sun is directly overhead and not blocked by clouds. So a 21% efficient solar panel will have a maximum output of 210 watts per square meter.</span></p><p>For a given spot on the Earth’s surface, irradiance will start at 0 watts per square meter when it’s completely dark, gradually rise to its maximum, and then fall back to zero at night. The graph below shows solar irradiance at the equator during a day in March.</p><p><span>Solar irradiance is maximized when light is perpendicular to the surface being struck: for a horizontal surface on the ground, this occurs when the sun is directly overhead. Because the earth is </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_of_the_Earth" rel="">approximately</a><span> a sphere, the farther north you go, the more tilted the surface of the earth will be in relation to the sun (i.e: the lower the sun will be in the sky), reducing the irradiance on a horizontal surface. And because the tilt of the earth’s axis </span><a href="https://www.weather.gov/fsd/season#:~:text=This%20is%20why%20the%20Earth's,path%20of%20the%20Sun's%20energy." rel="">changes in relation to the sun during the year</a><span>, solar irradiance will also change depending on the time of year: in the northern hemisphere, irradiance rises in the summer and falls in the winter. Below is the solar irradiance in Atlanta, Georgia (where I live) compared to the irradiance at the equator on the same day in March.</span></p><p>And here’s the maximum irradiance on a horizontal surface in Atlanta over the course of a year.</p><p>This means that the same solar panel in the same location will produce markedly different amounts of power at different times of the year, even before considering things like cloud obstruction. If I have 20 square meters of solar panels with 20% conversion efficiency mounted flat on the ground near Atlanta, on a cloudless day in June these panels will generate close to four kilowatts of power at their peak output. On a cloudless day in January, their peak output will be around half that.</p><p><span>Day-night cycles, changing solar irradiance depending on time of year and geographic location, and cloud obstruction all mean that solar PV panels are often producing much less power than they theoretically could. The average capacity factor of utility-scale solar PV in the US </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/annual/html/epa_04_08_b.html" rel="">is around 23%</a><span>, meaning that on average they produce 23% of the power they would if they were exposed to 1,000 watts per square meter of sunlight 24 hours a day. This capacity factor varies by location, with sunny Southwestern states having higher capacity factors than Northeastern states.</span></p><p>Peak power generation for a solar PV system will be in the middle of the day, when the sun is highest in the sky. This doesn’t align particularly well with patterns of electricity consumption, which tends to be highest in the early evening. For our 20 square meters of solar panels in Atlanta, here’s power produced, superimposed over the power consumption for a single family home.</p><p>We can see that the four kilowatts of power is substantially more than peak demand, which is less than two kilowatts. For most daylight hours, our solar system can more than meet our power demands. But peak demand occurs in the early evening, when solar production is virtually nothing. And our simulated house continues consuming power all through the night, when there’s no sunlight at all. This misalignment between electricity demand and solar PV supply is what produces the famous “duck curve,” which shows power required from non-solar sources when there’s a significant amount of solar capacity on the grid.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89e6a2a1-18ec-4fbc-9ae4-93792e5a208f_1200x556.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89e6a2a1-18ec-4fbc-9ae4-93792e5a208f_1200x556.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89e6a2a1-18ec-4fbc-9ae4-93792e5a208f_1200x556.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89e6a2a1-18ec-4fbc-9ae4-93792e5a208f_1200x556.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89e6a2a1-18ec-4fbc-9ae4-93792e5a208f_1200x556.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89e6a2a1-18ec-4fbc-9ae4-93792e5a208f_1200x556.png" width="1200" height="556" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/89e6a2a1-18ec-4fbc-9ae4-93792e5a208f_1200x556.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:556,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89e6a2a1-18ec-4fbc-9ae4-93792e5a208f_1200x556.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89e6a2a1-18ec-4fbc-9ae4-93792e5a208f_1200x556.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89e6a2a1-18ec-4fbc-9ae4-93792e5a208f_1200x556.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F89e6a2a1-18ec-4fbc-9ae4-93792e5a208f_1200x556.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>In winter, the situation is even worse. Our simulated Atlanta house uses a heat pump for heating, driving up wintertime electricity consumption. Our January peak power demand is now more than 9 kilowatts, far more than our solar PV system can produce even at its peak. And reduced solar irradiance means that peak power production is down to around two kilowatts.</p><p>In June, our 20 square meters of solar panels could supply about 52% of our home’s electricity demand. In January, it could only supply about 10%.</p><p><span>And in fact, the situation is even worse than this, because this simple simulation doesn’t include cloud cover. Not only will clouds sporadically reduce the power generated from our panels, but cloud cover tends to be </span><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6422379" rel="">higher in winter</a><span>, further reducing our already-anemic wintertime PV output. Here’s a week of output from our simulated 20 square meter PV system in January, with both no clouds and a simple cloud simulation.</span></p><p><span>This intermittency is the fundamental challenge with solar energy. We can’t turn sunlight off and on at will, and the amount of light a solar PV panel receives will vary depending on the time of day, time of year, and where on the Earth that panel is placed. At the same time, electricity demand will vary significantly, both over the course of a single day and seasonally, in ways that aren’t particularly convenient for solar PV. Peak electricity demand happens well outside peak solar hours, both over the course of a day and (assuming electrified heating) over the course of a year.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-159434840" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/understanding-solar-energy#footnote-3-159434840" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span></p><p>There are a few different ways we can address this intermittency problem. The most obvious one is to just use other sources of power when the sun isn’t shining; either power sources that can be turned on and off on demand (such as gas turbines), or other intermittent sources whose peaks are offset from solar (such as wind).</p><p>If we want to use an exclusively solar system, we have basically two strategies for dealing with intermittency. One is to increase the amount of power generated from our solar panels: this won’t let you generate power at night (on earth, anyway), but enough panel capacity can allow you to meet power demands in winter, low-light morning hours, or when it’s cloudy out. There are a variety of ways to increase panel power output:</p><ul><li><p>You can build more solar panels.</p></li><li><p><span>You can use solar cells with a higher conversion efficiency. Some research cells have reached nearly 50% efficiency, and the average conversion efficiency of commercial cells has </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/solar/photovoltaics-and-electricity.php#:~:text=The%20efficiency%20that%20PV%20cells,%2Dof%2Dthe%20art%20modules." rel="">trended upwards over time</a><span>.</span></p></li><li><p>You can tilt the solar panels to face the sun at a more favorable angle. Tracking solar systems mount motors to the solar panels to allow them to follow the sun. In the US, roughly 96% of new utility-scale systems have single axis tracking (ie: the panels can vary their tilt in one direction). And even non-tracking utility-scale systems will typically be built at a fixed angle chosen to maximize sunlight exposure based on geographic location.</p></li><li><p><span>You can use mirrors or lenses to concentrate more light onto your solar panels.

There are a variety of ways that this could be done — using electricity from our PV panels to spin a flywheel, or pump water uphill, or synthesize methane to later burn — but in practice today most new energy storage is in the form of large lithium-ion batteries.</p><p>In practice, dealing with intermittency requires both increasing the power produced by our panels and adding storage. Without storage, the biggest ground-based solar array in the world still produces zero power at night, and storage is only useful if our PV system is large enough to produce excess energy beyond what’s needed for immediate consumption.</p><p>What’s the relative value of additional solar PV capacity vs. additional storage? We can understand this by running simulations with different amounts of solar panel capacity and energy storage, and comparing it to the power demand for our theoretical single family home. The graph below shows power generated for our single family home at different solar PV capacities, without any storage.</p><p>With solar panels alone, we max out at slightly less than 50% of annual power demand met by our solar PV system: no matter how many panels we add, our system still can’t provide any power at night. But let’s see what it looks like when we start adding storage capacity.</p><p>As we increase the amount of storage, we can supply greater and greater proportions of our household’s electricity demand, reaching over 99% with 42 kilowatts (~200 square meters) of PV capacity and 80 kilowatt-hours of storage. This is around four times our maximum household power consumption, and roughly 40% more storage than the capacity of a base Tesla Model 3.</p><p>But both our storage capacity and our solar PV capacity are subject to diminishing returns. Each additional square meter of panel and kilowatt-hour of storage supplies a smaller and smaller proportion of our overall electricity demand, meaning each additional kilowatt-hour of electricity provided is more expensive than the last. We can supply 25% of our household’s electricity demands with 15 square meters of panels. But supplying 75% requires not three times the panel area (45 meters) but more than five times (85 meters), plus 20 kilowatt-hours of energy storage. And going from meeting 75% of demand to 95% of demand requires roughly doubling the size of the system, to 135 square meters of panels and 50 kilowatt-hours of storage.</p><p>So, while solar can easily supply relatively small fractions of electricity demand, this gets harder and harder, requiring more and more infrastructure, the greater the fraction of our energy we want solar to supply. For our simulated household, meeting 100% electricity demand requires 52 kilowatts (about 250 square meters) worth of panels, roughly five times our peak yearly consumption, and enough storage to power our house for almost four days straight during the summer. And even this might not be enough if we got a bad string of cloudy winter days. (The exact size of the system needed to meet ~100% demand can vary, with fewer panels trading off against more storage to some extent, but the basic point remains.)</p><p>But if solar and storage gets cheap enough, this “overbuilding” becomes much less of a concern: low enough costs mean that the system can remain competitive even as each additional kilowatt-hour gets more expensive than the last. When buying a new computer, no one worries about wasting money on excess hard drive space that only rarely gets used: hard drive capacity is so inexpensive we can just buy enormous quantities of it to cover whatever our future needs might be. So understanding the potential of solar PV means understanding what its cost trajectory looks like.</p><p>The costs of a solar PV system can be broken down into hard costs, soft costs, and operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs. Hard costs are the costs of the physical solar system itself: the photovoltaic panels, the inverters, the racking, the labor required to install it, and so on. Soft costs are design work, permitting, developer overhead, and other things not directly associated with building the physical system. O&amp;M costs are those incurred during the course of operation, including insurance, land leases, cleaning, replacing damaged parts, and so on. Below is a current hard and soft cost breakdown for fixed-tilt utility-scale solar in the US.</p><p><span>Overall US costs are slightly more than $1,000 per kilowatt. We see that thanks to 70 years of learning curve improvements, the solar PV cells themselves are less than 1/3rd the cost of the overall system. The shrinking fraction of the cost of PV cells vs the rest of the system are why there’s interest in things like ground-mounted solar which can </span><a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/utility-scale-solar-has-stagnated-so-erthos-mounts-pv-panels-right-on-the-ground" rel="">eliminate racking entirely</a><span>, and reducing installation costs by </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/climate/solar-panels-robots-maximo-construction.html" rel="">robotically installing solar panels</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>With storage, we see a broadly similar pattern. The costs of utility-scale storage can be broken down into the hard costs of the system itself, various soft costs associated with installing it, and ongoing maintenance costs. As with solar PV, the costs of lithium-ion batteries have steadily fallen over time due to various </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-we-got-the-lithium-ion-battery" rel="">learning curve effects</a><span> (increasing scale, more materially efficient batteries, and so on), though the costs of the battery itself remains a larger fraction of overall storage system cost than the module is for solar PV.</span></p><p>These are capital costs, but what about operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs? Because solar and storage systems don’t require purchasing fuel, and have almost no moving parts, operations and maintenance costs are low. NREL estimates that for utility PV, O&amp;M is about $16 dollars per kilowatt per year, or about 1.5% of capital costs annually.</p><p><span>For maintenance costs for battery storage, NREL doesn’t give a line-item breakdown, but </span><a href="https://atb.nrel.gov/electricity/2024/utility-scale_battery_storage" rel="">estimates</a><span> the annual cost of O&amp;M for battery storage is about 2.5% of the capital cost, or around $12 per kilowatt-hour for current US battery costs.</span></p><p>We can put this all together to calculate the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for our solar plus storage system and different fractions of electricity supplied. LCOE is simply the cost of an electric power generation system, divided by the amount of electricity it produces, and adjusted by the discount rate (which reduces both the present-day costs of future payments and the present-day value of future electricity generated).</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F846a53f1-5c3f-4f11-9b11-068648eae089_540x73.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F846a53f1-5c3f-4f11-9b11-068648eae089_540x73.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F846a53f1-5c3f-4f11-9b11-068648eae089_540x73.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F846a53f1-5c3f-4f11-9b11-068648eae089_540x73.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F846a53f1-5c3f-4f11-9b11-068648eae089_540x73.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F846a53f1-5c3f-4f11-9b11-068648eae089_540x73.png" width="540" height="73" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/846a53f1-5c3f-4f11-9b11-068648eae089_540x73.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:73,&quot;width&quot;:540,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F846a53f1-5c3f-4f11-9b11-068648eae089_540x73.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F846a53f1-5c3f-4f11-9b11-068648eae089_540x73.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F846a53f1-5c3f-4f11-9b11-068648eae089_540x73.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F846a53f1-5c3f-4f11-9b11-068648eae089_540x73.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>(In reality, it would not be possible to build a small-scale solar system for these costs; </span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/solar-photovoltaic-system-cost-benchmarks" rel="">residential solar PV costs are much higher.</a><span> The purpose is to illustrate how costs vary as solar PV serves a larger fraction of electricity demand.

If costs could be driven down even further, to what experts project we might reach (BloombergNEF projects a future cost of $400 per kilowatt for solar), we could reach nearly 80% of electricity demand with solar and storage for 10 cents a kilowatt hour, roughly the average cost for residential electricity generation in the US today.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-159434840" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/understanding-solar-energy#footnote-4-159434840" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span></p><p><span>Of course, there’s no guarantee that solar costs will continue to fall. Even if the learning curves for batteries and solar cells continue (and they might not: learning curves work until they don’t), solar costs might stay flat or even increase if we don’t find ways to drive down the costs of other parts of the system. We’re already seeing this to some extent. Per the </span><a href="https://seia.org/research-resources/solar-market-insight-report-q4-2024/" rel="">Solar Energy Industry Association</a><span>, utility-scale solar costs in the US have been roughly flat for the last six years, even as module costs have fallen, due to rising costs elsewhere in the system.</span></p><p>The main advantage of solar, aside from environmental considerations, is its low cost. A solar cell requires no fuel, has no moving parts, can be produced in large-scale factories in enormous volumes, and requires very little maintenance. Lay it down on the ground and it will start generating electric power, no muss no fuss.</p><p><span>The main drawback of solar is that we can’t control when the sun shines: day/night cycles, clouds, and seasonal changes in the sun’s position all reduce how much our solar panel generates, and make it hard to generate a given amount of electricity </span><em>reliably</em><span>. The greater the share of electricity supplied by solar power, the more extensive the infrastructure required to overcome this drawback, and the higher the cost.</span></p><p>But as the costs of solar continue to fall, this drawback becomes less binding, and it becomes economically justifiable to “overbuild” solar infrastructure and use it to serve increasingly large fractions of our energy demand.</p><p><em>Thanks to Austin Vernon for reading a draft of this post.

                                 <p>Evidence that the sequence may be finite, from <a href="https://oeis.org/wiki/User:Rick_L._Shepherd">Rick L. Shepherd</a>, Jun 23 2002:</p>
                             
                                 <p>1) The sequence of last two digits of 2^n, <a href="https://oeis.org/A000855" title="Final two digits of 2^n.">A000855</a> of period 20, makes clear that 2^n &gt; 4 must have n == 3, 6, 10, 11, or 19 (mod 20) for 2^n to be a member of this sequence. Otherwise, either the tens digit (in 10 cases), as seen directly, or the hundreds digit, in the 5 cases receiving a carry from the previous power's tens digit &gt;= 5, must be odd.</p>
                             
                                 <p>2) No additional term has been found for n up to 50000.</p>
                             
                                 <p>3) Furthermore, again for each n up to 50000, examining 2^n's digits leftward from the rightmost but only until an odd digit was found, it was only once necessary to search even to the 18th digit. This occurred for 2^12106 whose last digits are ...3833483966860466862424064. Note that 2^12106 has 3645 digits. (The clear runner-up, 2^34966, a 10526-digit number, required searching only to the 15th digit. Exponents for which only the 14th digit was reached were only 590, 3490, 8426, 16223, 27771, 48966 and 49519 - representing each congruence above.)</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/19/dutch_parliament_us_tech/">https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/19/dutch_parliament_us_tech/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43421902">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Not content to wait for open letters to influence the European Commission, Dutch parliamentarians have taken matters into their own hands by passing eight motions urging the government to ditch US-made tech for homegrown alternatives.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>With each IT service our government moves to American tech giants, we become dumber and weaker...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The motions were <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tweedekamer.nl/debat_en_vergadering/plenaire_vergaderingen/details/activiteit?id=2025A02077#:~:text=Moties%20ingediend%20bij%20het%20debat%20over%20migraties%20van%20overheids%2DICT%20naar%20het%20buitenland" rel="nofollow">submitted</a> and all passed yesterday during a discussion in the Netherlands' House of Representatives on concerns about government data being shipped overseas. While varied, they all center on the theme of calling on the government to replace software and hardware made by US tech companies, acquire new contracts with Dutch companies who offer similar services, and generally safeguard the country's digital sovereignty.</p>
<p>"With each IT service our government moves to American tech giants, we become dumber and weaker," Dutch MP Barbara Kathmann, author of four of the motions, told <em>The Register</em>. "If we continue outsourcing all of our digital infrastructure to billionaires that would rather escape Earth by building space rockets, there will be no Dutch expertise left."</p>
<p>Kathmann's measures specifically call on the government to stop the migration of Dutch information and communications technology to American cloud services, the creation of a Dutch national cloud, the repatriation of the .nl top-level domain to systems operating within the Netherlands, and for the preparation of risk analyses and exit strategies for all government systems hosted by US tech giants. The other measures make similar calls for eliminating the presence of US tech companies in government systems and the preference of local alternatives.</p>
<p>"We have identified the causes of our full dependency on US services," Kathmann told us. "We have to start somewhere – by pausing all thoughtless migrations to American hyperscalers, new opportunities open up for Dutch and European providers."</p>

    

<p>The motions passed by the Dutch parliament come as the Trump administration ratchets up tensions with a number of US allies – the EU among them. Nearly 100 EU-based tech companies and lobbyists sent an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/17/european_tech_sovereign_fund/">open letter</a> to the European Commission this week asking it to find a way to divest the bloc from systems managed by US companies due to "the stark geopolitical reality Europe is now facing."</p>

        


        

<p>Concerns over European reliance on US tech companies are mounting, with tech experts in the EU <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/03/microsoft_unveils_a_finalized_eu/">sounding the call</a> as the Trump administration's international posture becomes increasingly bellicose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boffins in the Netherlands, in particular, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/02/26/europe_has_second_thoughts_about/">rang the alarm</a> in February, with Dutch Electoral Council technical advisor Bert Hubert warning that using US cloud services was no longer safe for either the government or civil society.</p>

        

<p>It's perhaps for that reason that parliamentarians have been considering the motions passed yesterday for a while, as Kathmann explained.</p>
<p>"The US government has made the call for tech sovereignty an urgent geopolitical issue," Kathmann said. "We support EU tech's open letter, but these motions have a longer history."</p>

</ul>
<p>Kathmann told us her party, an opposition coalition of the Green and Labor parties, had been working with the governing centrist party, New Social Contract, to develop a new Dutch-centric tech plan since last year, the need for which has been made more pressing as American rhetoric shifts.</p>
<p>"The willingness of the Trump government to use their Big Tech monopoly to put political pressure on European governments, like the threat made to the International Criminal Court, and the attack on European tech laws (DSA, DMA) by VP Vance at the Munich Security Council, have shaken up Dutch politics," Kathmann said.</p>
<h3>Will the government actually act?</h3>
<p>If the Dutch government takes action, the Netherlands would be the first European nation to repatriate its tech stack from US companies as relations sour. The government is under no obligation to conform to the nonbinding motions, however.</p>
<p>"With eight out of eight proposals passed, it's almost impossible for the government to not take action," Kathmann insisted. "The State Secretary is not legally obligated to follow up on motions, but not acting on such a broad majority in parliament is nearly unheard of."</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the House of Representatives told us "almost all" motions put to the House are accepted, which may mean that the eight-for-eight passage puts less pressure on the government than Kathmann hopes.</p>

        

<p>That said, a ninth measure discussed alongside the other eight motions also passed, and the government has already accepted it. That particular measure, which asks the government to increase cooperation in the government service when it comes to implementing information provisions and digitization policies, doesn't mention divestment from US tech companies. Nonetheless, its passage signals the government is paying attention.</p>
<p>"Our party will do whatever we can to keep the government to the parliamentary calls to action," Kathmann said.&nbsp;®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">The European Union has sent Apple <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_816" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">preliminary instructions</a> on how it expects the iPhone maker to comply with interoperability provisions in the bloc’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), its flagship market contestability reform.</p>

<p>According to the Commission, device manufacturers and app developers should be able to access nine iOS connectivity features that were restricted to Apple’s exclusive use before, such as peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connectivity, NFC features and device pairing. As a result, Bluetooth headphones, smartwatches, connected TVs, or other, non-Apple devices should work better with an iPhone.</p>







<p>Google could use this opportunity to make AirDrop work with Android devices. Headphone manufacturers could support SharePlay, a feature that only works with AirPods for now.</p>

<p>This follows the Commission’s opening of two specification proceedings on Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/eu-to-tell-apple-how-to-do-interoperability-dma-style/">back in September</a> — one of which focused on ensuring the DMA’s interoperability requirements are effectively met when it comes to Apple allowing connected devices to tap into iOS’s connectivity features, including notifications and device pairing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second concerns requests for interoperability made by third-party app developers with features of Apple’s iOS and iPadOS platforms. In that case, the Commission recommends improved access to technical documentation as well as better communication with third-party companies using those features. The EU is asking for “timely communication and updates, and a more predictable timeline for the review of interoperability requests.”</p>

<p>The proceedings are possible because Apple has been designated as a “gatekeeper” under the DMA, with both its mobile platforms subject to the regulation’s interoperability rules for so-called “core platform services.” (Reminder: Penalties for non-compliance with the DMA can reach up to 10% of global annual turnover.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the legislation contains plenty of upfront details about how gatekeepers are expected to comply with the various provisions — such as bans on gatekeepers self-preferencing and, indeed, interoperability mandates — the law also allows the Commission to set out more specific instructions where it believes extra detail is needed to ensure effective compliance.</p>


<p>The EU is concerned that Apple is not providing a level playing field for third-party connected devices to integrate with its platforms — to, for example, be able to properly display iOS notifications on a non-Apple smartwatch screen, or have a smooth iPhone pairing experience with a (non-Apple) smart speaker.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apple isn’t happy about either the DMA, in general, or these specific interoperability mandates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the case of the latter, it accuses the EU of singling out its business — since no other gatekeepers have been subject to specification proceedings, as yet.&nbsp;</p>







<p>In a background briefing with journalists ahead of the EU releasing preliminary findings on the proceedings, Apple also attacked the Commission’s actions as anti-innovation, framing the moves as meddling micromanagement by public officials.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The company argues that the bloc’s actions could end up limiting which technologies and features it makes available in the region since it said the DMA will mean it’s forced to make all its innovations immediately available to rivals — suggesting it will therefore have to invest engineering time in testing and debugging third-party integrations prior to shipping new features in the EU.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, Apple claims the specification proceedings could lead to dire consequences for its European users’ privacy and security — since it says the bloc is requiring that it sends unencrypted data to third parties. According to Apple, the Commission rejected suggestions it made to try and mitigate some of these risks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apple claims the interoperability requirements mean it will be forced to expose potentially sensitive user data — from notifications containing personal messages or one-time codes, to details of Wi-Fi networks users have joined — to outside developers that could abuse the information for tracking and profiling.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Social media ad giant Meta — whose business empire is based on tracking and profiling to sell ads — has been a leading requester of app interoperability capabilities, per Apple.</p>

<p>Because of the EU’s interpretation of the law, Apple also says it will be unable to take steps to protect users from entities seeking to use the DMA to obtain unfettered access to their information for their own commercial gain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apple also told TechCrunch the EU barred Apple from providing information to users about potential risks when they agree to receive their iOS notifications on a third-party device — in this case users will see a pop-up, per Apple, but it will just ask if they wish to receive their notifications on the connected device, without the additional context the company believes users should also be given.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So-called Apple “scare screens” — aka, info pop-ups related to third-party transactions, interactions, or access where the company frames contact with external entities as risky for its users — have been a perennial gripe of some developers, including those who lobbied the EU to pass the DMA, as they suggest the company deploys such tactics maliciously, to undermine the openness the regulation is shooting for.&nbsp;</p>







<p>In a statement following the EU’s preliminary decision on the specification proceedings, Apple said: “Today’s decisions wrap us in red tape, slowing down Apple’s ability to innovate for users in Europe and forcing us to give away our new features for free to companies who don’t have to play by the same rules. It’s bad for our products and for our European users. We will continue to work with the European Commission to help them understand our concerns on behalf of our users.”</p>

<h2 id="h-a-level-playing-field">A level playing field</h2>

<p>While Apple frames the DMA as anti-innovation, several smaller companies have been complaining about the company’s (lack of) interoperability. Earlier this week, when Pebble creator Eric Migicovsky <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/18/pebble-creator-unveils-the-first-new-pebble-inspired-smartwatches/">unveiled its new smartwatches</a>, he also wrote <a href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/apple-restricts-pebble-from-being-awesome-with-iphones" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a lengthy blog post</a> explaining all of Apple’s restrictions that make third-party smartwatches worse than the Apple Watch.</p>

<p>“There is no way for us to support all the functionality that Apple Watch has access to. It’s impossible for a 3rd party smartwatch to send text messages, or perform actions on notifications (like dismissing, muting, replying) and many, many other things,” Migicovsky wrote.</p>

<p>Migicovsky describes his new company as “a labour of love” for people looking for a fun, hackable smartwatch. And he disagrees with Apple’s attacks on the DMA. “They’re clearly using their market power to lock consumers into their walled ecosystem. This causes there to be less competition, which increases prices and reduces innovation,” Migicovsky wrote.</p>

<p>And things have become <em>harder</em> for third-party smartwatch companies in recent years. Since iOS 13, notification content previews are hidden on your iPhone lockscreen by default until you unlock your iPhone. As a result, smartwatch makers can’t get the content of your notifications unless users manually enable full content previews on the lockscreen.</p>

<p>Instead of asking users to weaken the security level on iOS, Migicovsky would like to be able to use the same APIs that the Apple Watch is currently using. “If you live in Europe, thank you for voting for representatives who passed the DMA. We will be petitioning Apple under DMA Article 6 to request interoperability with Apple Watch APIs,” he wrote.</p>

<p>While Migicovsky is this week’s vocal opponent of Apple’s platform restrictions, many startup founders are quietly nodding in agreement. According to them, Apple should allocate a small portion of its development resources to create a level playing field, allowing anyone to innovate and compete fairly with the tech company that currently has the greatest market capitalization in the world.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-index="0" data-js="panel" data-type="wysiwyg-with-aside" data-modular-content="" data-modular-content-collection="">
<p>Drawing separator lines between various sections of a webpage is a common design technique, which can help to structure the content and make it more readable, as well as more aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>As we’ll see in this article, there are techniques you can use today to draw separator lines with CSS, but they also come with limitations.</p>
<p>In this article, we’re introducing <strong>CSS gap decorations</strong>, a <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/blob/main/CSSGapDecorations/explainer.md">new proposal</a> which we would love <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/issues/new?template=css-gap-decorations.md">your feedback</a> on. If this is of interest to you, read this article and help us shape the future of CSS by providing your feedback.</p>
<h2>Existing workarounds and limitations</h2>
<p>Using the <code>border</code> CSS property is a very common way to draw separators. However, it also comes with limitations and, with today’s CSS layout techniques, such as CSS Grid and Flexbox, using borders can often be in the way of simpler code.</p>
<p>Imagine a Flexbox container, with multiple items laid out horizontally:</p>
<figure><p><a href="https://pub-d00f534024b04d0e8036586fc78a41fa.r2.dev/sites/33/2025/03/border-workaround.png"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://pub-d00f534024b04d0e8036586fc78a41fa.r2.dev/sites/33/2025/03/border-workaround.png" alt="A three column layout. Each column has an image and some text. Vertical lines visually separate the columns." width="1200" height="237"></a></p></figure>
<p>One way to display a vertical separator between the items is to add a border to the right, or left, of each item. Some of the drawbacks with this solution are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding a border changes the size of the items, which might not be desirable.</li>
<li>This technique requires you to write special code for the first or last item, to avoid drawing an extra border before or after that item.</li>
<li>Borders are tied to items, not to the layout the items are in. Imagine a flexbox layout with multiple wrapping lines. With a border, you wouldn’t be able to display a separator line that spans the entire horizontal space between the multiple wrapping flex lines.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another way to display separators is to use the <code>::before</code> or <code>::after</code> pseudo-elements. Each flex item would position a pseudo-element either before or after itself, such that it sits in between the items. One advantage here is that pseudo-elements support all the styling properties that normal elements do, allowing you to be very creative with your separator lines. However, this is still a workaround which also comes with drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Special code is needed for the first or last item, as before.</li>
<li>Some complex absolute positioning code is needed to position the separator line, which requires you to know the size of the gaps between the items.</li>
</ul>
<p>To make things more complicated, imagine another example where a CSS grid container defines a few rows and columns, and where some grid items occupy one cell, while others span multiple cells:</p>
<figure><p><a href="https://pub-d00f534024b04d0e8036586fc78a41fa.r2.dev/sites/33/2025/03/complex-layout-example.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://pub-d00f534024b04d0e8036586fc78a41fa.r2.dev/sites/33/2025/03/complex-layout-example.png" alt="A more complex layout with 3 rows and 4 coloumns. Cells contain text and/or images. Some cells span multiple rows, others span multiple columns." width="1200" height="509"></a></p></figure>
<p>Using CSS borders or pseudo-elements to add separators between items of the grid can quickly get complicated. This is especially true if the grid is responsive and the items don’t always occupy the same position or span the same number of cells.</p>
<p>One workaround you can use in this case is to artificially draw separators by letting the grid container’s background color show through a grid gap, and making the grid items match the background color of the page.</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="css">body {
  background: white;
}

.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template: repeat(4, 1fr) / repeat(3, 1fr);
  /* Adding a 2px gap between cells. */
  gap: 2px;
  /* Setting the color of the gap by giving the container a background color. */
  background: black;
}

.item {
  /* Hiding the background of the container by giving items a background color. */
  background: white;
}</pre>
<p>This creates the illusion of separator lines between the grid cells. This technique addresses the issues that the previous methods faced because the <code>gap</code> CSS property handles the complicated logic of knowing where the space between the items is located. You no longer need to know where to place borders or pseudo-elements.</p>
<p>However, this is also just a workaround which falls short in some cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting the length of the separator lines isn’t possible. The lines will always fill as much of the gap between the cells as they can.</li>
<li>If the grid contains one or more empty cells, the background color of the container will be visible in those cells, breaking the illusion of the separator lines.</li>
<li>If the grid items don’t stretch and fill their assigned cells (e.g. <code>place-self: center</code>), then the background color of the grid container will also be visible outside of the gap areas.</li>
<li>Finally, this technique doesn’t work if your page background isn’t a plain color.</li>
</ul>
<p>One more way to draw lines between sections of content in a layout is to use the <code>column-rule</code> CSS property, which works in multi-column layouts.</p>
<p>If your content can be laid out in columns and if you only need separators between those columns, then using multi-column layout is a great option.</p>
<figure><p><a href="https://pub-d00f534024b04d0e8036586fc78a41fa.r2.dev/sites/33/2025/03/multi-column.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://pub-d00f534024b04d0e8036586fc78a41fa.r2.dev/sites/33/2025/03/multi-column.png" alt="A multi-column layout with text flowing through three vertical columns. The columns are visually separated by vertical lines." width="1200" height="250"></a></p></figure>
<p>However, this only work in multi-column layouts, which might not always be the right solution, depending on what you’re trying to achieve. For example, in a multi-column layout you can’t control where content goes in the inline direction, only in the block direction.</p>
<h2>The CSS gap decorations proposal</h2>
<p>We’re introducing a new solution to address the above shortcomings: <strong>CSS gap decorations</strong>.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, you can already use the <code>column-rule</code> CSS property (and corresponding <code>column-rule-*</code> longhand properties) to draw lines between columns in a multi-column layout. With CSS gap decorations, we’re proposing to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extend the property to apply to other layout types, such as grid and flexbox.</li>
<li>Introduce the <code>row-rule</code> property to match with <code>column-rule</code>.</li>
<li>Expand the syntax of these properties to allow for different gap decorations in different parts of a container.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example demonstrating how the proposed <code>row-rule</code> property, and its new syntax, allows for multiple decorations to be defined:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="css">alternate-red-blue {
  display: grid;
  grid-template: repeat(auto-fill, 30px) / repeat(6, 100px);
  gap: 10px;
  row-rule: 1px solid;
  row-rule-color: red blue;
}</pre>
<p>The multiple color values in the <code>row-rule-color</code> property are used to alternate the color of the row gap decorations, as shown below:</p>
<figure><p><a href="https://pub-d00f534024b04d0e8036586fc78a41fa.r2.dev/sites/33/2025/03/alternating-decorations.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://pub-d00f534024b04d0e8036586fc78a41fa.r2.dev/sites/33/2025/03/alternating-decorations.png" alt="Grid layout with five columns and five rows. Each cell of the grid contains some text. The rows are separated visually by alternating red and blue horizontal bars." width="1200" height="529"></a></p></figure>
<p>A similar syntax could be used to define a thicker line on the first and last row of a grid, and a thinner one on the other rows:</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="css">.varying-widths {
  dispay: grid;
  grid-template: repeat(auto-fill, 30px) / repeat(6, 100px);
  row-gap: 10px;
  row-rule: 5px solid black / repeat(auto, 1px solid #666) / 3px solid black;
}</pre>
<p>The proposal also makes it possible to fine-tune gap decorations using additional properties. The <code>*-rule-break</code> and <code>*-rule-outset</code> properties control where gap decorations start and end relative to items in the container, including spanning items.</p>
<p>For example, you can make your gap decorations extend as far as possible along the centerline of a given gap, or stop at intersections, and even fine-tune how much of an offset you want between the decoration and the intersection, and in a way that even works when there are spanning grid items.</p>
<figure><p><a href="https://pub-d00f534024b04d0e8036586fc78a41fa.r2.dev/sites/33/2025/03/gap-intersection-fine-tuning.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://pub-d00f534024b04d0e8036586fc78a41fa.r2.dev/sites/33/2025/03/gap-intersection-fine-tuning.png" alt="Three variants of a 4 by 4 grid layout. Some of the cells span multiple columns, others span multiple rows. Rows are separated by red lines. Columns are separated by blue lines. The variants show that the lines can either extend to the entire track length, or stop at intersections, and that the offset at which they stop can be changed." width="1200" height="360"></a></p></figure>
<h2>Help us shape the proposal</h2>
<p>We’re excited about the CSS gap decorations proposal and want to make sure it matches your needs. Developer feedback as early as possible is crucial for building useful APIs and features.</p>
<p>To learn more about our proposal, <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/blob/main/CSSGapDecorations/explainer.md">read the explainer</a>. If you have any feedback about it, please let us know by <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/issues/new?template=css-gap-decorations.md">opening an issue in our GitHub repo</a>.</p>
<p>One specific area where we would love more feedback is controlling the behavior of gap decorations at intersections. But we also welcome any other feedback on the proposal: suggestions for things we might be missing, scenarios that we might be overlooking, anecdotes of when you could’ve used this, or even just a general <em>“this sounds cool”</em> message.</p>

    <p><a href="https://austral-lang.org/"><strong>Austral</strong></a> is a new systems programming language. You can think of
it as Rust: The Good Parts or a modernized, stripped-down Ada. It features a
strong static type system, linear types, capability-based security, and strong
modularity.</p>

<p>This article is an introduction to the language. The first few sections are
high-level: they are about the design and the mindset of the language. The next
two sections, about linear types and capability-based security, are much more
detailed and technical: they are meant to prove to the reader that the claims
being made about security and correctness are true.</p>

<h2 id="goals">Design Goals</h2>

<p>There is a <a href="https://austral-lang.org/spec/spec.html#goals">section</a> in the rationale that explains the design goals for
Austral, but it boils down to two things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Simplicity</li>
  <li>Strictness</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Simplicity</em> means different things to different people. Some use it to mean
familiarity, or ease of use, or even terseness. Simplicity here has a
straightforward definition: it is the amount of information it takes to describe
a system.</p>

<p>Complex systems, with lots of moving parts that impinge on one another, cannot
be described briefly. Rube Goldberg machines, biology, and C++ are complex
systems. Python is a complex system, despite being “easy” to
use<sup id="fnref:python" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:python" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Simple systems have short descriptions.</p>

<p>Simplicity is an overriding goal because programming languages <em>are not
tools</em>. A programming language is the toolbox, plus the building material, plus
the laws of physics of the universe where the product is being built. You can,
sometimes, in rare situations, hide a complex system under a simple
interface. But not programming languages, because complex programming languages
are like a universe where the gravitational constant changes daily.</p>

<p>There’s this famous <a href="https://wordsandbuttons.online/so_you_think_you_know_c.html">quiz</a> of the C language, where you have all these
strange-looking programs and have to decide what they output. And people who
have been working with the language for years struggle to answer correctly
because the questions refer to subtle and obscure features of the C
specification.</p>

<p>If you think figuring out what the program does is a fun puzzle, Austral is not
for you. <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/L/language-lawyer.html">Language lawyering</a> is a design flaw: if two people can
look at the same basic program and disagree about its behaviour, that’s a
problem.</p>

<p>Austral is simple. Short spec, thin runtime, small compiler.</p>

<p>To give a concrete example: the linear type system was designed with brutal
simplicity in mind. Consequently, Austral’s equivalent of a borrow checker is
<a href="https://github.com/austral/austral/blob/32fba714b3fe900e79c39682e44b63846017f4df/lib/LinearityCheck.ml">less than 600 lines of code</a>, including the implementation of
borrowing and other ergonomic features.</p>

<p>The goal here is that the entire programming language should fit in your head,
that you should be able to read the <a href="https://austral-lang.org/spec/spec.html">specification</a> from beginning to end
and know all there is to know about the language.</p>

<p><em>Strictness</em> is half language features, and half a change in mindset.</p>

<p>If planes were flown like we write code, we’d have daily crashes, of course, but
beyond that, the response to every plane crash would be: “only a bad pilot
blames their plane! If they’d read subparagraph 71 of section 7.1.5.5 of the
C++, er, 737 spec, they’d know that at 13:51 PM on the vernal equinox the wings
fall off the plane.”</p>

<p>This doesn’t happen in aviation, because in aviation we have decided, correctly,
that <em>human error is an intrinsic and inseparable part of human activity</em>. And
so we have built concentric layers of mechanical checks and balances around
pilots, to take on part of the load of flying. Because humans are tired, they
are burned out, they have limited focus, limited working memory, they are
traumatized by writing executable YAML, <em>etc</em>.</p>

<p>Mechanical processes—such as type systems, type checking, formal verification,
design by contract, static assertion checking, dynamic assertion checking—are
independent of the skill of the programmer. Mechanical processes <em>scale</em>, unlike
berating people to simply write fewer bugs.</p>

<p>Strictness is rarely one big language feature, rather, it’s about learning from
the design flaws in other languages, the “death by a thousand cuts”<sup id="fnref:cuts" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:cuts" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, and
preventing the causes of each of them. This can be hard because programmers get
very attached to the flaws.</p>

<p>An example: there is a feature of C syntax where, for terseness, you can write
<code>if</code> statements without braces. This introduces a syntactic ambiguity: it’s
called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_else">“dangling else”</a> problem. The fact that there’s a Wikipedia
article about it should suggest that this is bad. This isn’t some abstract
academic concern: it has caused <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreachable_code#goto_fail_bug">real-world security vulnerabilities</a>.</p>

<p>Now, if you suggest that this is a flaw, some programmers will invoke the old
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought-terminating_clich%C3%A9">thought-terminating cliche</a>: “only a bad craftsman blames his
tools!”. But the tradeoff here is obvious: you save a few bytes and a few
milliseconds of typing, but you roll the dice and possibly introduce a CVE that
causes billions of dollars of harm. It’s self-evidently a design flaw, but if
you suggest to programmers that they should add the braces, they will kick and
scream as if you’re taking away some fundamental freedom.</p>

<p>Austral’s syntax was designed with <a href="http://langsec.org/">language security</a> principles in
mind: it is context-free, it can be parsed from a grammar, there’s no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexer_hack">“lexer
hack”</a>, there are no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_vexing_parse">strange, ad-hoc ambiguity-resolution
mechanisms</a>. The pragmatics of the syntax are designed to minimize
confusion and ambiguity.</p>

<p>For another example, consider the problem of operator precedence: anyone can
remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations">PEMDAS</a>, but programming languages have many categories of
binary operators—arithmetic, comparison, bitwise, Boolean—and mixing them
together creates room for error (what does <code>x ^ y &amp;&amp; z / w</code> evaluate to?). So in
Austral there is simply no operator precedence: any binary expression deeper
than one level is fully parenthesized. You have to type more, but we are not
typists, we are programmers, and our task is to communicate <em>to others</em> what we
want computers to do. When in doubt: simplify by paring down the language.</p>

<p>This isn’t for everyone. But it is for me, because after ten years in the
industry, the last thing I want from a programming language is “power”. What I
want are fewer nightmares. The “liberties” that programming languages provide
feel like expressive power <em>until</em> your codebase becomes a mental health
superfund site.</p>

<h2 id="anti-features">Anti-Features</h2>

<p>Before going over the language features, I’d like to list the
<em>anti-features</em>. Here are the things Austral proudly doesn’t have:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>There are no pervasive <code>NULL</code>s, and therefore no null pointer dereference
errors. You have to use an explicit <code>Option</code> type.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no garbage collection, so the runtime can be thin and performance is
predictable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no exceptions and no stack unwinding and no destructors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no surprise control flow: you have conditionals, loops, and function
calls. And nothing else.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no implicit type conversions anywhere.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>More generally: <em>there are no implicit function calls</em>. If it’s not in the
source code, it’s not happening, and you’re not paying the cost of it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no global state.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no runtime reflection.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no macros.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are no Java or Python-style <code>@Annotations</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no type inference: type information flows in only one direction,
and function parameters, local variables, <em>etc.</em> have to have their types
annotated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no first-class async<sup id="fnref:async" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:async" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Function overloading is very restricted through typeclasses (think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concepts_(C%2B%2B)">C++
concepts</a>). And the basic arithmetic operators cannot be
overloaded<sup id="fnref:overload" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:overload" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no syntactic ambiguity: no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_else">dangling else</a> (and, therefore,
no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreachable_code#goto_fail_bug"><code>gotofail</code></a>), no arithmetic precedence, no syntactic
precedence rules of any kind.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no syntactic extension: you can’t, for example, introduce new infix
operators.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>What Austral <em>does</em> have:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A strong, static type system that’s not too big-brained.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A type system which allows resources to be handled correctly and safely
without runtime overhead. “Resource” here means memory and anything that has
an explicit lifecycle of create-use-destroy: file handles, sockets, database
handles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security">Capability-based security</a>, which prevents <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_attack">supply chain
attacks</a>. Your left-pad dependency can’t be compromised to
upload the contents of your disk to a remote server. This is because code
that performs network access has to be explicitly given a network capability,
code that performs filesystem access needs a filesystem capability, etc. A
string-padding function that claims to need network access instantly stands
out. Capabilities are unforgeable, secure authorization tokens for code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A strong, Ada-inspired module system which is not tied to filesystem
structure and which separates module interfaces from implementations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type">Sum types</a> with pattern matching and exhaustiveness checking.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://austral-lang.org/spec/spec.html#type-classes">Type classes</a>, as in Haskell, for restricted function
overloading. As in Haskell, type parameters can be constrained to only accept
types that implement a given typeclass.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A strict, context-free, unambiguous syntax, informed by <a href="http://langsec.org/">langsec</a>
ideas.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="lang-overview">Language Overview</h2>

<p>The largest unit of code organization is the module. Modules have explicit names
and are decoupled from the filesystem, like Haskell and unlike Python. Modules
are divided into an interface and an implementation, like Ada or OCaml.</p>

<p>This is <em>not</em>, as in C or C++, a hack to enable separate compilation. It’s about
readability and separation of concerns. The interface file contains declarations
that are public, but no code. The implementation file contains the
implementations of what is in the interface file, as well as private
declarations.</p>

<p>There are five kinds of declaration:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Constants.</li>
  <li>Types.</li>
  <li>Functions.</li>
  <li>Typeclasses.</li>
  <li>Typeclass instances.</li>
</ol>

<p>Each of these can either be public (by appearing in the interface file) or
private, which determines whether they are importable by other modules. Types
have an additional visibility state: <em>opaque</em>, which means they can be imported
by other modules, but they cannot be constructed or their contents accessed
outside the module, except through the module’s public API. Opaque types are the
obvious choice for data structures whose internals are hidden.</p>

<p>Functions work like you expect: they take values and return them. Instead of
<code>void</code> there is a <code>Unit</code> type with a constant called <code>nil</code>.</p>

<p>Typeclasses define an interface that types can conform to, and instances define
how a particular type implements a particular typeclass.</p>

<p>Types and functions can be generic. The way generics work is slightly different
than in most languages, due to the linearity system.</p>

<h2 id="linear">Linear Types</h2>

<p>It is difficult to advertise a language as being “simple” and then start talking
about “linear types” and “type universes”, but it is only the words that are
new. The concepts are simple. Austral’s entire linear type system <a href="https://austral-lang.org/spec/spec.html#linearity">fits in a
page</a>. So, this isn’t some abstract ivory tower feature that you
need a PhD in category theory to understand.</p>

<p>Linear types let us have manual memory management, without runtime overhead, and
without security vulnerabilities: they prevent memory leaks, use-after-free, and
double-free errors.</p>

<p>This extends beyond memory to anything that has a lifecycle, where we have to
create it, use it, and destroy it in a certain order. File handles, network
sockets, database handles, locks and mutexes: the correct usage of these objects
can be enforced at compile time.</p>

<p>First, I’ll explain the motivation: why do we need linear types? Then I’ll
explain what they are, and how they provide safety.</p>

<h2 id="linear-motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>Consider a file handling API:</p>

<div><pre><code>type File
File openFile(String path)
File writeString(File file, String content)
void closeFile(File file)
</code></pre></div>

<p>An experienced programmer understands the <em>implicit lifecycle</em> of the <code>File</code>
object:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We create a <code>File</code> handle by calling <code>openFile</code>.</li>
  <li>We write to the handle zero or more times.</li>
  <li>We close the file handle by calling <code>closeFile</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>We can depict this graphically like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://borretti.me/assets/content/introducing-austral/file-api.svg" alt="A graph with three nodes labeled 'openFile', 'writeString', and 'close File'. There are four arrows: from 'openFile' to 'writeString', from 'openFile' to 'closeFile', from 'writeString' to itself, and from 'writeString' to 'closeFile'."></p>

<p>But, crucially: this lifecycle is <em>not enforced by the compiler</em>. There are a
number of erroneous transitions that we don’t consider, but which are
technically possible:</p>

<p><img src="https://borretti.me/assets/content/introducing-austral/file-api-errors.svg" alt="The graph from the previous figure, with a new node labeled 'leak', and with four new arrows in red: one from 'closeFile' to itself labeled 'double close', one from 'closeFile' to 'writeString' labeled 'use after close', one from 'openFile' to 'leak' labeled 'forgot to close', and one from 'writeString' to 'leak' also labeled 'forgot to close'."></p>

<p>These fall into two categories:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Leaks:</strong> we can forget to call <code>closeFile</code>, e.g.:</p>

    <div><pre><code> let file = openFile("hello.txt");
 writeString(file, "Hello, world!");
 // Forgot to close
</code></pre></div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Use-After-Close:</strong> and we can call <code>writeString</code> on a <code>File</code> object that
has already been closed:</p>

    <div><pre><code>closeFile(file);
writeString(file, "Goodbye, world!");
</code></pre></div>

    <p>And we can close the file handle after it has been closed:</p>

    <div><pre><code>closeFile(file);
closeFile(file);
</code></pre></div>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In a short linear program like this, we aren’t likely to make these
mistakes. But when handles are stored in data structures and shuffled around,
and the lifecycle calls are separated across time and space, these errors become
more common.</p>

<p>And they don’t just apply to files. Consider a database access API:</p>

<div><pre><code>type Db
Db connect(String host)
Rows query(Db db, String query)
void close(Db db)
</code></pre></div>

<p>Again: after calling <code>close</code> we can still call <code>query</code> and <code>close</code>. And we can
also forget to call <code>close</code> at all.</p>

<p>And — crucially — consider this memory management API:</p>

<div><pre><code>type Pointer&lt;T&gt;
Pointer&lt;T&gt; allocate(T value)
T load(Pointer&lt;T&gt; ptr)
void store(Pointer&lt;T&gt; ptr, T value)
void free(Pointer&lt;T&gt; ptr)
</code></pre></div>

<p>Here, again, we can forget to call <code>free</code> after allocating a pointer, we can
call <code>free</code> twice on the same pointer, and, more disastrously, we can call
<code>load</code> and <code>store</code> on a pointer that has been freed.</p>

<p>Everywhere we have <em>resources</em> — types with an associated lifecycle, where
they must be created, used, and destroyed, in that order — we have the same
kind of errors: forgetting to destroy a value, or using a value after it has
been destroyed.</p>

<p>In the context of memory management, pointer lifecycle errors are so disastrous
they have their own names:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Doubly_freeing_memory">Double free errors</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Using_freed_memory">Use-after-free errors</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Naturally, computer scientists have attempted to attack these problems. The
traditional approach is called <em>static analysis</em>: a group of PhD’s will write a
program that goes through the source code and performs various checks and finds
places where these errors may occur.</p>

<p>Reams and reams of papers, conference proceedings, university slides, etc. have
been written on the use of static analysis to catch these errors. But the
problem with static analysis is threefold:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>It is a moving target. While type systems are relatively fixed — i.e., the
type checking rules are the same across language versions — static
analyzers tend to change with each version, so that in each newer version of
the software you get more and more sophisticated heuristics.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like unit tests, it can usually show the <em>presence</em> of bugs, but not their
<em>absence</em>. There may be false positives — code that is perfectly fine but
that the static analyzer flags as incorrect — but more dangerous is the
false negative, where the static analyzer returns an all clear on code that
has a vulnerability.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Static analysis is an opaque pile of heuristics. Because the analyses are
always changing, the programmer is not expected to develop a mental model of
the static analyzer, and to write code with that model in mind. Instead, they
are expected to write the code they usually write, then throw the static
analyzer at it and hope for the best.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>What we want is a way to solve these problems that is <em>static</em> and
<em>complete</em>. Static in that it is a fixed set of rules that you can learn once
and remember, like how a type system works. <em>Complete</em> in that is has <em>no false
negatives</em>, and <em>every</em> lifecycle error is caught.</p>

<p>And, above all: we want it to be simple, so it can be wholly understood by the
programmer working on it.</p>

<p>So, to summarize our requirements:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Correctness Requirement:</strong> We want a way to ensure that resources are used
in the correct lifecycle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Simplicity Requirement:</strong> We want that mechanism to be simple, that is, a
programmer should be able to hold it in their head. This rules out
complicated solutions involving theorem proving, SMT solvers, symbolic
execution, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Staticity Requirement:</strong> We want it to be a fixed set of rules and not an
ever changing pile of heuristics.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>All these goals are achievable: the solution is <em>linear types</em>.</p>

<h2 id="linear-what">What Linear Types Are</h2>

<p>In the physical world, an object occupies a single point in space, and objects
can move from one place to the other. Copying an object, however, is
impossible. Computers invert this: copying is the primitive operation. While an
object in memory resides in a single place, <em>references</em> or pointers to that
object can be copied any number of times, and passed around through threads, and
this freedom to copy things wildly is at the root of all resource-related
security vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>A <em>type</em> is a set of values that share some structure. A <em>linear type</em> is a type
whose values can only be used once.</p>

<p>Linear values work like real-world objects: they occupy a single point in space,
and they can be passed around, but <em>not duplicated</em>. This restriction may sound
onerous (and unrelated to the problem) but we will see it isn’t.</p>

<p>Austral’s linear type system is defined by just two rules: the <strong>Linear Universe
Rule</strong> and the <strong>Use-Once Rule</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="linear-universes">Universes</h2>

<p>First, the set of types is divided into two <em>universes</em>: the <em>free</em> universe,
containing types which can be used any number of times (like booleans, machine
sized integers, floats, records containing free types, etc.); and the <em>linear</em>
universe, containing linear types, which usually represent resources (pointers,
file handles, database handles, etc.).</p>

<p>Types enter the linear universe in one of two ways:</p>

<p>The first is by fiat: a type can simply be declared linear, even though it only
contains free types. We’ll see later why this is useful.</p>

<pre><code>-- `Pos` is declared to be linear, even though it
-- only contains free types.
record Pos: Linear is
    x: Int32;
    y: Int32;
end;
</code></pre>

<p>The second is by containment: linear types can be thought of as being
“viral”. If a type contains a value of a linear type, it automatically becomes
linear.</p>

<p>So, if you have a linear type <code>T</code>, then a record like:</p>

<pre><code>record Example: Linear is
    a: A;
    b: B;
    c: Pair[T, A];
end;
</code></pre>

<p>is linear because the field <code>c</code> contains a type which in turn contains <code>T</code>. A
union or enum where one of the variants contains a linear type is,
unsurprisingly, linear. You can’t sneak a linear type into a free type.</p>

<p>The virality of linear types ensures that you can’t escape linearity by accident.</p>

<h2 id="linear-once">The Use-Once Rule</h2>

<p>A value of a linear type must be used once and only once. Not <em>can</em>: <em>must</em>. It
cannot be used zero times. This can be enforced entirely at compile time through
a very simple set of checks.</p>

<p>To understand what “using” a linear value means, let’s look at some examples.</p>

<p>Suppose you have a function <code>f</code> that returns a value of a linear type <code>L</code>.</p>

<p>Then, the following code:</p>

<pre><code>begin
    let x: L := f();
end;
</code></pre>

<p>is incorrect. <code>x</code> is a variable of a linear type, and it is used zero
times. The compiler will complain that <code>x</code> is being silently discarded.</p>

<p>Similarly, if you have:</p>

<pre><code>begin
    f();
end;
</code></pre>

<p>The compiler will complain that the return value of <code>f</code> is being silently
discarded, which you can’t do to a linear type.</p>

<p>If you have:</p>

<pre><code>begin
    let x: L := f();
    g(x);
    h(x);
end;
</code></pre>

<p>The compiler will complain that <code>x</code> is being used twice: it is passed into
<code>g</code>, at which point is it said to be <em>consumed</em>, but then it is passed into
<code>h</code>, and that’s not allowed.</p>

<p>This code, however, passes: <code>x</code> is used once and exactly once:</p>

<pre><code>begin
    let x: L := f();
    g(x);
end;
</code></pre>

<p>“Used” does not, however, mean “appears once in the code”. Consider how <code>if</code>
statements work. The compiler will complain about the following code, because
even though <code>x</code> appears only once in the source code, it is not being “used
once”, rather it’s being used — how shall I put it? 0.5 times?:</p>

<pre><code>begin
    let x: L := f();
    if cond() then
        g(x);
    else
        -- Do nothing.
        skip;
    end if;
end;
</code></pre>

<p>The variable <code>x</code> is consumed in one branch but not the other, and the compiler
isn’t happy. If we change the code to this:</p>

<pre><code>begin
    let x: L := f();
    if cond() then
        g(x);
    else
        h(x);
    end if;
end;
</code></pre>

<p>Then we’re good. The rule here is that a variable of a linear type, defined
outside an <code>if</code> statement, must be used either zero times in that statement,
or exactly once in each branch.</p>

<p>A similar restriction applies to loops. We can’t do this:</p>

<pre><code>begin
    let x: L := f();
    while cond() do
        g(x);
    end while;
end;
</code></pre>

<p>Because even though <code>x</code> appears once, it is <em>used</em> more than once: it is used
once in each iteration. The rule here is that a variable of a linear type,
defined outside a loop, cannot appear in the body of the loop.</p>

<p>And that’s it. That’s all there is to it. We have a fixed set of rules, and
they’re so brief you can learn them in a few minutes. So we’re satisfying the
simplicity and staticity requirements listed in the previous section.</p>

<p>But do linear types satisfy the correctness requirement? In the next section,
we’ll see how linear types make it possible to enforce that a value should be
used in accordance to a lifecycle.</p>

<h2 id="linear-safety">Linear Types and Safety</h2>

<p>Let’s consider a linear file system API. We’ll use the syntax for Austral module specifications:</p>

<pre><code>module Files is
    type File : Linear;
    function openFile(path: String): File;
    function writeString(file: File, content: String): File;
    function closeFile(file: File): Unit;
end module.
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>openFile</code> function is fairly normal: takes a path and returns a linear
<code>File</code> object.</p>

<p><code>writeString</code> is where things are different: it takes a linear <code>File</code> object
(and consumes it), and a string, and it returns a “new” linear <code>File</code>
object. “New” is in quotes because it is a fresh linear value only from the
perspective of the type system: it is still a handle to the same file. But don’t
think about the implementation too much: we’ll look into how this is implemented
later.</p>

<p><code>closeFile</code> is the destructor for the <code>File</code> type, and is the terminus of the
lifecycle graph: a <code>File</code> enters and does not leave, and the object is disposed
of. Let’s see how linear types help us write safe code.</p>

<p>Can we leak a <code>File</code> object? No:</p>

<pre><code>let file: File := openFile("test.txt");
-- Do nothing.
</code></pre>

<p>The compiler will complain: the variable <code>file</code> is used zero
times. Alternatively:</p>

<pre><code>let file: File := openFile("test.txt");
writeString(file, "Hello, world!");
</code></pre>

<p>The return value of <code>writeString</code> is a linear <code>File</code> object, and it is being
silently discarded. The compiler will complain at us.</p>

<p>We can strike the “leak” transitions from the lifecycle graph:</p>

<p><img src="https://borretti.me/assets/content/introducing-austral/file-api-without-leaks.svg" alt="A graph with three nodes labeled 'openFile', 'writeString', and 'close File'. There are four black arrows: from 'openFile' to 'writeString', from 'openFile' to 'closeFile', from 'writeString' to itself, and from 'writeString' to 'closeFile'. There are two red arrows: one from 'closeFile' to 'writeString' labeled 'use after close', and one from 'closeFile' to itself labeled 'double close'."></p>

<p>Can we close a file twice? No:</p>

<pre><code>let file: File := openFile("test.txt");
closeFile(file);
closeFile(file);
</code></pre>

<p>The compiler will complain that you’re trying to consume a linear variable
twice. So we can strike the “double close” erroneous transition from the
lifecycle graph:</p>

<p><img src="https://borretti.me/assets/content/introducing-austral/file-api-without-leaks-and-double-close.svg" alt="A graph with three nodes labeled 'openFile', 'writeString', and 'close File'. There are four black arrows: from 'openFile' to 'writeString', from 'openFile' to 'closeFile', from 'writeString' to itself, and from 'writeString' to 'closeFile'. There is one red arrow: from 'closeFile' to 'writeString' labeled 'use after close'."></p>

<p>And you can see where this is going. Can we write to a file after closing it?
No:</p>

<pre><code>let file: File := openFile("test.txt");
closeFile(file);
let file2: File := writeString(file, "Doing some mischief.");
</code></pre>

<p>The compiler will, again, complain that we’re consuming <code>file</code> twice. So we can
strike the “use after close” transition from the lifecycle graph:</p>

<p><img src="https://borretti.me/assets/content/introducing-austral//file-api.svg" alt="A graph with three nodes labeled 'openFile', 'writeString', and 'close File'. There are four arrows: from 'openFile' to 'writeString', from 'openFile' to 'closeFile', from 'writeString' to itself, and from 'writeString' to 'closeFile'."></p>

<p>And we have come full circle: the lifecycle that the compiler enforces is
exactly, one-to-one, the lifecycle that we intended.</p>

<p>There is, ultimately, one and only one way to use this API such that the
compiler doesn’t complain:</p>

<pre><code>let f: File := openFile("test.txt");
let f1: File := writeString(f, "First line");
let f2: File := writeString(f1, "Another line");
...
let f15: File := writeString(f14, "Last line");
closeFile(f15);
</code></pre>

<p>Note how the file value is “threaded” through the code, and each linear variable
is used exactly once.</p>

<p>And now we are three for three with the requirements we outlined in the previous
section:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Correctness Requirement:</strong> Is it correct? Yes: linear types allow us to
define APIs in such a way that the compiler enforces the lifecycle perfectly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Simplicity Requirement:</strong> Is it simple? Yes: the type system rules fit in a
napkin. There’s no need to use an SMT solver, or to prove theorems about the
code, or do symbolic execution and explore the state space of the
program. The linearity checks are simple: we go over the code and count the
number of times a variable appears, taking care to handle loops and <code>if</code>
statements correctly. And also we ensure that linear values can’t be
discarded silently.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Staticity Requirement:</strong> Is it an ever-growing, ever-changing pile of
heuristics? No: it is a fixed set of rules. Learn it once and use it forever.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="linear-db">A Safe Database API</h2>

<p>And does this solution generalize? Let’s consider a linear database API:</p>

<pre><code>module Database is
    type Db: Linear;
    function connect(host: String): Db;
    function query(db: Db, query: String): Pair[Db, Rows];
    function close(db: Db): Unit;
end module.
</code></pre>

<p>This one’s a bit more involved: the <code>query</code> function has to return a tuple
containing both the new <code>Db</code> handle, and the result set.</p>

<p>Again: we can’t leak a database handle:</p>

<pre><code>let db: Db := connect("localhost");
-- Do nothing.
</code></pre>

<p>Because the compiler will point out that <code>db</code> is never consumed. We can’t <code>close</code> a database handle twice:</p>

<pre><code>let db: Db := connect("localhost");
close(db);
close(db); -- error: `db` consumed again.
</code></pre>

<p>Because <code>db</code> is used twice. Analogously, we can’t query a database once it’s closed:</p>

<pre><code>let db: Db := connect("localhost");
close(db);
-- The below is tuple destructuring notation.
let { first as db1: Db, second: Rows } := query(db, "SELECT ...");
close(db); -- error: `db` consumed again.
-- another error: `db1` never consumed.
</code></pre>

<p>For the same reason. The only way to use the database correctly is:</p>

<pre><code>let db: Db := connect("localhost");
let { first as db1: Db, second: Rows } = query(db, "SELECT ...");
// Iterate over the rows or some such.
close(db1);
</code></pre>

<h2 id="linear-borrowing">Borrowing</h2>

<p>Returning tuples from every function and threading linear values through the
code is very verbose.</p>

<p>It is also often a violation of the principle of least privilege: linear values,
in a sense, have “root permissions”. If you have a linear value, you can destroy
it. Consider the linear pointer API described above: the <code>load</code> function could
internally deallocate the pointer and allocate it again.</p>

<p>We wouldn’t <em>expect</em> that to happen, but the whole point is to be defensive. We
want the language to give us some guarantees: if a function should only be
allowed to read from a linear value, but not deallocate it or mutate its
interior, we want a way to represent that.</p>

<p><a href="https://austral-lang.org/tutorial/borrowing"><em>Borrowing</em></a> is stolen lock, stock, and barrel from Rust. It
improves ergonomics by allowing us to treat a Linear value as Free within a
delineated context. And it allows us to degrade permissions: functions that
should only be able to read data from a linear value can take a read-only
reference, functions that should be able to mutate (but not destroy) a linear
value can take a mutable reference.</p>

<p>Passing the linear value itself is the highest level of permissions: it allows
the receiving function to do anything whatever with that value, by taking
complete ownership of it.</p>

<p>Unlike Rust, Austral’s borrowing is more restricted. The tradeoff is: you have
to type more, but it’s syntactically clearer where region lifetimes end, and the
model is conceptually simpler. This is why the linearity checker is a mere 600
lines of OCaml.</p>

<h2 id="cap">Capability-Based Security</h2>

<p>If you read software engineering literature from the 80’s, the overwhelming
concern is about software reuse. Today, we have the opposite problem: package
ecosystems contain hundreds of thousands of packages, written by many authors,
and applications transitively have thousands of dependencies. This introduces a
new category of security vulnerability: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_attack">supply chain attack</a>,
where an attacker adds malware to a single library used transitively by
millions of computers.</p>

<p>But why is a <em>single</em> malware dependency out of thousands enough to compromise
security? Because code is overwhelmingly permissionless. Or, rather: all code
has the same permission level: do anything. Without inspecting the code, you
have no way of knowing whether <code>leftPad</code> pads a string <em>or</em> reads your entire
home directory and uploads it to a remote server.</p>

<p>Austral’s solution is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security">capability-based security</a>. Code should be
permissioned. To access the filesystem, or the network, or other privileged
resources, libraries should require permission to do so. Then it is evident,
from function signatures, what each library is able to do, and what level of
auditing is required.</p>

<p>Furthermore: capabilities can be arbitrarily granular. Beneath the capability to
access the entire filesystem, we can have a capability to access a specific
directory and its contents, or just a specific file, further divided into read,
write, and read-write permissions. For network access, we can have capabilities
to access a specific host, or capabilities to read, write, and read-write to a
socket.</p>

<p>Access to the computer clock, too, <a href="https://twitter.com/robotlolita/status/1474351603008389122">should be restricted</a>, since accurate
timing information can be used by malicious or compromised dependencies to carry
out a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack">timing attack</a> or exploit a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack">side-channel vulnerability</a>
such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)">Spectre</a>.</p>

<h2 id="cap-linear">Linear Capabilities</h2>

<p>A capability is a value that represents an unforgeable proof of having
permission to perform an action. They have the following properties:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Capabilities can be destroyed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Capabilities can be surrendered by passing them to others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Capabilities cannot be duplicated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Capabilities cannot be acquired out of thin air: they must be passed by the
client.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Capabilities in Austral are implemented as linear types: they are destroyed by
being consumed, they are surrendered by simply passing the value to a function
(i.e., by being consumed), they are non-duplicable since linear types cannot be
duplicated. The fourth restriction must be implemented manually by the
programmer.</p>

<h2 id="cap-fs">A Capability-Secure Filesystem API</h2>

<p>Consider a non-capability-secure filesystem API:</p>

<pre><code>module Files is
    -- File and directory paths.
    type Path: Linear;
    -- Creating and disposing of paths.
    function Make_Path(value: String): Path;
    function Dispose_Path(path: Path): Unit;
    -- Reading and writing.
    generic [R: Region]
    function Read_File(path: &amp;[Path, R]): String;
    generic [R: Region]
    function Write_File(path: &amp;![Path, R], content: String): Unit;
end module.
</code></pre>

<p>(Error handling <em>etc.</em> omitted for clarity.)</p>

<p>Here, any client can construct a path from a string, then read the file pointed
to by that path or write to it. A compromised transitive dependency could then
read the contents of your home directory, or any file in the filesystem that the
process has access to, like so:</p>

<pre><code>let p: Path := Parse_Path(Make_String("/etc/passwd"));
let secrets: String := Read_File(&amp;p);
-- Send this over the network, using an equally capability-insecure network
-- API.
uploadToCompromisedServer(secrets);
</code></pre>

<p>In the context of code running on a programmer’s personal computer, that means
personal information. In the context of code running on an application server,
that means confidential bussiness information.</p>

<p>What does a capability-secure filesystem API look like? Like this:</p>

<pre><code>module Files is
    type Path: Linear;
    -- The filesystem access capability.
    type Filesystem: Linear;
    -- Given a read reference to the filesystem access capability,
    -- get the root directory.
    generic [R: Region]
    function Get_Root(fs: &amp;[Filesystem, R]): Path;
    -- Given a directory path, append a directory or
    -- file name at the end.
    function Append(path: Path, name: String): Path;
    -- Reading and writing.
    generic [R: Region]
    function Read_File(path: &amp;[Path, R]): String;
    generic [R: Region]
    function Write_File(path: &amp;[Path, R], content: String): Unit;
end module.
</code></pre>

<p>This demonstrates the hierarchical nature of capabilities, and how granular we
can go:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If you have a <code>Filesystem</code> capability, you can get the <code>Path</code> to the root
directory. This is essentially read/write access to the entire filesystem.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you have a <code>Path</code> to a directory, you can get a path to a subdirectory or
a file, but you can’t go <em>up</em> from a directory to its parent.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you have a <code>Path</code> to a file, you can read from it or write to it.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Each capability can only be created by providing proof of a higher-level, more
powerful, broader capability.</p>

<p>Then, if you have a logging library that takes a <code>Path</code> to the logs directory,
you know it has access to that directory and to that directory only<sup id="fnref:dotdot" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:dotdot" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>. If
a library doesn’t take a <code>Filesystem</code> capability, it has no access to the
filesystem.</p>

<p>But: how do we create a <code>Filesystem</code> value? The next section explains this.</p>

<h2 id="cap-root">The Root Capability</h2>

<p>Capabilities cannot be created out of thin air: they can only be created by
proving proof that the client has access to a more powerful capability, for
example by passing a reference to that capability. This recursion has to end
somewhere.</p>

<p>The root of the capability hierarchy is a value of type <code>Root_Capability</code>. This
is the first argument to the entrypoint function of an Austral program. For our
capability-secure filesystem API, we’d add a couple of functions:</p>

<pre><code>-- Acquire the filesystem capability from a reference
-- to the root capability.
generic [R: Region]
function Get_Filesystem(root: &amp;[Root_Capability, R]): Filesystem;

-- Relinquish the filesystem capability.
function Release_Filesystem(fs: Filesystem): Unit;
</code></pre>

<p>And we can use it like so:</p>

<pre><code>import Files (
    Filesystem,
    Get_Filesystem,
    Path,
    Get_Root,
    Append,
    Relase_Filesystem,
);
import Dependency (
    Do_Something
);

<h2 id="status">Status and Future Work</h2>

<p>There is a bootstrapping <a href="https://austral-lang.org/">compiler</a> written in OCaml, and a
<a href="https://austral-lang.org/spec/spec.html">specification</a>. Software is only ever asymptotically finished, but the
compiler implements the entire language, and the compiler and spec are at a
level of maturity where I can write simple programs and talk about it in public.</p>

<p>The compiler is a very simple, whole program compiler that outputs C. Separate
compilation, for added performance, is not yet implemented but is in the
roadmap.</p>

<p>The immediate next steps are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write the basic parts of the standard library.</li>
  <li>A build system and package manager.</li>
  <li>Fast separate compilation support.</li>
</ol>

<p>If I can allocate the time, I’d like to use OpenAI’s finetuning API to teach a
code completion model to write Austral for me. I had some promising results
teaching Austral to ChatGPT interactively. I think the language is uniquely good
for this, because the separation of module interfaces and implementations means
I can probably design an interface and have a model complete the implementation
for me.</p>

<h2 id="involved">Getting Involved</h2>

<p>A beginning is a unique time. Like annealing: the atoms are in rapid motion, and
have yet to settle in a fixed configuration. Decisions made early have a vastly
disproportionate impact. So if you have strong opinions about standard library
APIs, or build systems and package managers, or security, I’d like to hear from
you.</p>

<p>There’s a small <a href="https://discord.gg/8cEuAcD8pM">Discord</a> for the language, but the best way to
communicate is probably through public <a href="https://github.com/austral/austral/issues">GitHub issues</a>. Or you can ping
me on <a href="https://twitter.com/zetalyrae">Twitter</a>, which is the fastest way to reach me.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>And without further ado:</p>

<div><pre><code>function main(): ExitCode is
    printLn("Hello, world!");
    return ExitSuccess();
end;
</code></pre></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="04f7954960b1">For the past two weeks, I’ve been spending most of my time rewriting our CI scripts in GitHub Actions. This is the third time we’ve had to redo our CI setup—first GitHub Actions, then <a href="https://earthly.dev/">Earthly</a> (which we moved away from because it was discontinued), and now, reluctantly, back to GitHub Actions.</p><p id="07dc3a94dbeb">Our CI is complex: merge queues, multiple runners (self-hosted, <a href="https://blacksmith.sh/">blacksmith.sh</a>, GitHub-hosted), Rust builds, Docker images, and heavy integration tests. Every PR we merge burns through an hour of CI time, running across multiple parallel runners.</p><p id="8c6854fbbe43">There are a few things we'd like to have (which we deem as "good software practice") but it's nothing unheard of:</p><ol><li>Everything that goes into `main` must pass all tests.</li><li>Trivial mistakes (formatting, unused deps, lint issues) should be fixed automatically, not cause failures.</li><li>The artifacts we test with in CI should be the exact ones we release.</li><li>CI should complete quickly (to keep developers happy).</li></ol><p id="834216755732">GitHub Actions technically allows all of this—but setting it up is a frustrating mess, full of hidden gotchas, inconsistent behavior, and a debugging experience that makes me question my choices.</p><h3 id="56a4dbb8bf83">Strange Way to Enforce Status Checks with Merge Queue</h3><p id="fd16fccbbdb2">The key to enforcing a clean <code>main</code> branch is GitHub’s <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/configuring-pull-request-merges/managing-a-merge-queue">merge queue</a>, which rebases a PR onto <code>main</code> before running CI. Sounds great. But here’s the fun part:</p><ul><li>We need CI to run <em>before</em> entering the queue to auto-fix trivial issues.</li><li>We need CI to run <em>again</em> inside the queue to verify the final merge.</li><li>GitHub Actions makes it weirdly hard to require both runs to pass.</li></ul><p id="8e1619327bba">The solution? <strong>Name the jobs identically</strong> in both phases. That’s it. GitHub treats them as the same check, so they both need to succeed. Solved by reading this answer in a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76655935/when-does-a-github-workflow-trigger-for-merge-group-and-is-it-restricted-by-bran/78030618#78030618">Stack Overflow post</a> after a few hours of debugging. Any other way you try to do this leads to either status checks being awaited before you put something in the queue (so it never starts the job) or worse, things just get merged even if the job you'd like to pass in the merge queue fails.</p><h3 id="d7687fc57c00">A security nightmare?</h3><p id="e118b355141b">A few days ago, someone <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43368870">compromised a popular GitHub Action</a>. The response? "Just pin your dependencies to a hash." Except as comments also pointed out, almost no one does.</p><p id="be904b86b98a">Even setting aside supply chain attacks, GitHub’s security model is a confusing maze to me: My point of view is that if I can't understand a security model easily it's probably doomed to fail or break at some point. Disclaimer: I'm writing this as a github actions user with only a vague understanding of it so I'd be delighted to hear that it is not just "things piled on top of things until it's safe", which is my current impression. I do understand very well that the problem of having secure CI for distributed source control is complicated.</p><p id="57fa6b17ef27">In github, there is a "default" token called <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code>. The way it works is that it gets initialized with some default permissions. You can set that default in the settings of your repository (under Actions -&gt; General -&gt; Workflow Permissions). Here is what the github documentation says about it:</p><blockquote><p>If the default permissions for the GITHUB_TOKEN are restrictive, you may have to elevate the permissions to allow some actions and commands to run successfully. If the default permissions are permissive, you can edit the workflow file to remove some permissions from the GITHUB_TOKEN.</p><span>- Github Documenation</span></blockquote><p id="34005ba8540c">Removing permission that aren't necessary sounds nice (though I do think a better "default" would be to start with <strong>no privileges</strong> and require the user to add whatever is needed). Unfortunately, there are <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#permissions">many of them</a> and it's hardly clear for all of them what they are protecting if you're not a github expert.</p><p id="39fa8482d7a0">Your workflow permissions also don’t really depend on the action itself. Here is an example of such an instance, I'm using <code>softprops/action-gh-release</code> to automatically create a new release on github</p><div><pre><code><span>-</span><span> </span><span>name:</span><span> </span><span>Release</span><span> </span><span>on</span><span> </span><span>GitHub</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>if:</span><span> </span><span>env.version_exists</span><span> </span><span>==</span><span> </span><span>'false'</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>uses:</span><span> </span><span>softprops/action-gh-release@v2</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>with:</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>tag_name:</span><span> </span><span>v${{</span><span> </span><span>env.CURRENT_VERSION</span><span> </span><span>}}</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>generate_release_notes:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>make_latest:</span><span> </span><span>true</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>token:</span><span> </span><span>${{</span><span> </span><span>secrets.CI_RELEASE</span><span> </span><span>}}</span></code></pre></div><p id="1acd29788f81">Why do I need a custom token? Because without it, the release completes, but doesn’t trigger our post-release workflow. The sad part is that you don't get any indication about it until you eventually <a href="https://github.com/softprops/action-gh-release/issues/59">find an issue</a> where someone had the same problem and that leads you in the right direction.</p><p id="cfe2d1a4c40f">You can also elevate permissions in your workflow yaml file. That seems like a strange thing to do inside the code you're trying to protect. At least there are some limitations according to the github docs:</p><p id="daddc3d76619">You can use the <code>permissions</code> key to add and remove read permissions for forked repositories, but typically you can't grant write access. The exception to this behavior is where an admin user has selected the <strong>Send write tokens to workflows from pull requests</strong> option in the GitHub Actions settings. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#enabling-workflows-for-private-repository-forks">Managing GitHub Actions settings for a repository</a>.</p><p id="678e558d777b">This is just one of many instances which I believe is the root of what makes the github actions security model so obscure: there are too many pitfalls accompanied by exceptions that you have to account for. Clearly the system is very powerful and allows you to do many things but it also expands the attack surface for breaking things.</p><p id="e00abccbfba2">As far as I can tell I'm not alone in this. Another instance of the same problem I ran into is when I read <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners">this paragraph</a> where they recommend that you don't use self-hosted runners in public repositories:</p><blockquote><p>We recommend that you only use self-hosted runners with private repositories. This is because forks of your public repository can potentially run dangerous code on your self-hosted runner machine by creating a pull request that executes the code in a workflow.</p><span>- Github Documentation</span></blockquote><p id="20e7090b06ce">However, github also has a setting for self-hosted runners where pull-requests from external collaborators need to be approved before running. A practical question that comes up for me is "are self-hosted runners in combination with this setting safe"? I do believe so, but github documentation doesn't say and there is no consensus in the rest of the internet about it. It's hard to be 100% confident given how much complexity there is. Even github documentation writers don't seem to understand their security model anymore.</p><h3 id="33b01436e240">Docker and Github Actions, an Unholy Combination</h3><p id="4ea29a97fd50">If you thought GitHub Actions was bad, try mixing in Docker.</p><p id="3cc29b3a3a20">GitHub lets you <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-where-your-workflow-runs/running-jobs-in-a-container">run jobs inside a container</a>. This is great in theory—you can prepackage dependencies into a dev container instead of installing them every run. In practice:</p><ol><li>File permissions break constantly. A container builds files as one user, but GitHub runners may use another (different uid and gid) to run it. So it may be unable to either access the files in the container or in the github workspace and temporary host directories that get mounted.</li><li>The <code>$HOME</code> directory moves. Your dev container may install tools into <code>/home/ubuntu</code>, but inside GitHub Actions, it’s suddenly <code>/github/home</code>. Tools that rely on files in <code>$HOME</code> may no longer find them.</li><li>Any action that interacts with the host system might break now. For example, I use <a href="https://docs.blacksmith.sh/github-actions-runners/sticky-disks">blacksmith’s sticky disk action</a> to mount an NVMe drive for caching (since GitHub caches are limited to 10GB). It didn’t work inside a container until <a href="https://docs.blacksmith.sh/github-actions-runners/sticky-disks#using-sticky-disks-inside-a-container">they made a fix for me</a> (thanks to Aditya Jayaprakash from blacksmith.sh for the one day turn-around time on this!).</li></ol><p id="37c2cef1c9a2">Meanwhile, the <code>container</code> field itself has weird limitations. Want to override the entrypoint? Nope. Want to run <em>some</em> steps inside a container and others outside? Nope.</p><h3 id="15cb942fcdc2">Developing Workflows with YAML</h3><p id="8e060b2d72ac">All of this logic you end up writing in YAML can unfortunately get complicated pretty quickly and you're bound to make mistakes. I was using RustRover as my IDE when writing the YAML which had some linter checks for github YAML built-in and it helped a lot. I still found myself wishing for much better static checking for all of this. It doesn't help that you can't really try any of this locally (I know of <a href="https://github.com/nektos/act">act</a> but it only supports a small subset of the things you're trying to do in CI). I found that the best way to debug CI is to create an identical repo to the one you're trying to make changes for and do <code>git commit -a -m "wip" &amp;&amp; git push test-ci branch</code> until CI works as expected.</p><p id="d0bc10f501f0">Since I didn't want to run the whole CI pipeline every time I made a change, I tried to keep individual workflows small and have them push artifacts at the end of their steps, then subsequent workflows could download the artifacts and re-use them instead of rebuilding everything from scratch. This lets you test workflows in isolation because you can just download artifacts from a previous run until it works (of course when downloading from a previous run one needs to provide a token to the download-artifact action, but this can just be the default token. Why does it still need to be provided then is yet another unsolved mystery...).</p><p id="215acba7bd25">The main workflow file then becomes a chain of invoking other YAML files:</p><div><pre><code><span>jobs:</span><span>  
</span>  invoke-build-rust:  
<span></span><span>    name:</span><span> Build Rust  
</span><span></span><span>    uses:</span><span> ./.github</span><span>/workflows/</span><span>build-rust.yml  
</span>

Another gotcha that took me too long to figure out. Every time when I ran the entire CI pipeline things wouldn't work but when I ran the steps individually they would work just fine (that's because when you call a workflow from another workflow secrets aren't shared by default).</p><p id="a9a473aa7f3d">There are many more gotchas I wanted to write about, but the post is already quite long. Overall, I'm still happy with <a href="https://github.com/feldera/feldera/tree/main/.github/workflows">our new CI scripts</a> because it reduced the time to merge significantly for us. I just wish the process to get there would be less time-consuming and that it would be easier to debug when things go wrong. I guess, I'm hoping for some innovation here.</p></div></div>]]></description>

                <!-- Course Introduction -->
                <h3>The Course</h3>
                <p>
                    “Deep Learning” systems, typified by deep neural networks, are increasingly taking over all the AI
                    tasks, ranging from language understanding, speech and image recognition, to machine translation,
                    planning, and even game playing and autonomous driving. As a result, expertise in deep learning is 
                    fast changing from an esoteric desirable to a mandatory prerequisite in many advanced academic 
                    settings, and a large advantage in the industrial job market.
                </p>
                <p> In this course we will learn about the basics of deep neural networks, and their applications to
                    various AI tasks. By the end of the course, it is expected that students will have significant 
                    familiarity with the subject, and be able to apply Deep Learning to a variety of tasks. They will 
                    also be positioned to understand much of the current literature on the topic and extend their 
                    knowledge through further study.
                </p>

                <!-- Course Description -->
                <h3>Course Description from a Student's Perspective</h3>
                <p> 
                    The course is well rounded in terms of concepts. It helps us understand the fundamentals of Deep
                    Learning. The course starts off gradually with MLPs and it progresses into the more complicated
                    concepts
                    such as attention and sequence-to-sequence models. We get a complete hands on with PyTorch which is
                    very
                    important to implement Deep Learning models. As a student, you will learn the tools required for
                    building Deep Learning models. The homeworks usually have 2 components which is Autolab and Kaggle.
                    The
                    Kaggle components allow us to explore multiple architectures and understand how to fine-tune and
                    continuously improve models. The task for all the homeworks were similar and it was interesting to
                    learn
                    how the same task can be solved using multiple Deep Learning approaches. Overall, at the end of this
                    course you will be confident enough to build and tune Deep Learning models.
                </p>

                <!-- Prerequisites -->
                <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>We will be using Numpy and PyTorch in this class, so you will need to be able to program in
                        python3.
                    </li>
                    <li>You will need familiarity with basic calculus (differentiation, chain rule), linear algebra, and
                        basic probability. </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Units</h3>
                <p>Courses 11-785 and 11-685 are equivalent 12-unit graduate courses, and have a final project and HW5
                    respectively. <br>
                    Course 11-485 is the undergraduate version worth 9 units, the only difference being that there is no
                    final project or HW5.
                </p>

                                            The task is for all students to review and grade 4-6 of the videos. 
                                            It is to be completed over the last weekend, after classes finish (but before finals week). 
                                            We will tell you which projects you have been assigned to review; each review should take around 15~20 minutes. 
                                            Here is what we expect you to do for each review:
                                            </li><li> Watch the video carefully. As you watch the video, jot down some notes/concerns/questions that you might have.</li>

                                            11-685 Students may choose to do a Project instead of HW5. Either your

                <h3>Study groups</h3>
                <p>
                    We believe that effective collaboration can greatly enhance student learning.
                    Thus, this course employs study groups for both quizzes and homework ablations.
                    It is highly recommended that you join a study group; Check piazza for further updates.
                </p>

                <h3>Piazza: Discussion Board</h3>
                <p>Piazza is what we use for discussions. You should be automatically signed up if you're enrolled at
                    the start of the semester. If not, please sign up <a href="https://www.piazza.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.
                    Also, please follow the <ahref="etiquette.html">Piazza Etiquette when you use the piazza forum.</ahref="etiquette.html"></p>

                <h3>AutoLab: Software Engineering</h3>
                <p><b>AutoLab</b> is what we use to
                    test your understand of low-level concepts, such as engineering your own libraries, implementing
                    important algorithms, and developing optimization methods from scratch.</p>

                <h3>Kaggle: Data Science</h3>
                <p><a href="https://kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> is where we test your understanding and ability to extend
                    neural network architectures discussed in lecture. Similar to how AutoLab shows scores, Kaggle also shows
                    scores, so don't feel intimidated -- we're here to help. We work on hot AI topics, like speech
                    recognition, face recognition, and neural machine translation.</p>

                <h3>MediaServices/YouTube: Lecture and Recitation Recordings</h3>
                <p> CMU students who are not in the live lectures should watch the uploaded lectures at <b><a href="https://mediaservices.cmu.edu/channel/11785-+Introduction+to+Deep+Learning/" target="_blank">MediaServices</a></b>
                    in order to get attendance credit. Links to individual videos will be
                    posted as they are uploaded.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8hYZGEkI2dDO8scT8C5UQA" target="_blank">Our YouTube
                        Channel</a> is where non-CMU folks can view all lecture and recitation recordings.
                        Videos marked “Old“ are not current, so please be aware of the video title.</p>

                <h3>Books and Other Resources</h3>
                <p>The course will not follow a specific book, but will draw from a number of sources. We list relevant
                    books at the end of this page. We will also put up links to relevant reading material for each
                    class. Students are expected to familiarize themselves with the material before the class. The
                    readings will sometimes be arcane and difficult to understand; if so, do not worry, we will present
                    simpler explanations in class.</p>

                <p>You can also find a nice catalog of models that are current in the literature <a href="http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/concise-visual-summary-of-deep-learning-architectures" target="_blank">here</a>.
                    We expect that you will be in a position to interpret, if not fully understand many of the
                    architectures on the wiki and the catalog by the end of the course.</p>

                <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
                <div><p>
                    You are expected to comply with the <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html" target="_blank">University
                        Policy on Academic Integrity and Plagiarism</a>.
                    </p><ul>
                        <li>You are allowed to talk with and work with other students on homework assignments.</li>
                        <li>You can share ideas but not code. You should submit your own code.</li>
                    </ul><p>
                    Your course instructor reserves the right to determine an appropriate penalty based on the violation
                    of academic dishonesty that occurs. Violations of the university policy can result in severe penalties
                    including failing this course and possible expulsion from Carnegie Mellon University. If you have
                    any questions about this policy and any work you are doing in the course, please feel free to contact
                    your instructor for help.

<h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
<ul>
<li><span>The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument collaboration has publicly released the first 13 months of data from its main survey — a treasure trove that will help other researchers investigate big questions in astrophysics.</span></li>
<li><span>Although DESI’s Data Release 1 is only a fraction of what the experiment will capture, the 270-terabyte dataset holds a vast amount of information, including precise distances to millions of galaxies.</span></li>
<li><span>DESI’s data release contains more than twice as many unique objects outside our galaxy as in all previous 3D spectroscopic surveys combined.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (<a href="https://www.desi.lbl.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>DESI</span></a>) is mapping millions of celestial objects to better understand dark energy: the mysterious driver of our universe’s accelerating expansion. Today, the DESI collaboration released a new collection of data for anyone in the world to investigate. The dataset is the largest of its kind, with information on 18.7 million objects:&nbsp;roughly 4 million stars, 13.1 million galaxies, and 1.6 million quasars (extremely bright but distant objects powered by supermassive black holes at their cores).</p>
<p>While the experiment’s main mission is illuminating dark energy, <a href="https://data.desi.lbl.gov/doc/releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>DESI’s Data Release 1 (DR1)</span></a> could yield discoveries in other areas of astrophysics, such as the evolution of galaxies and black holes, the nature of dark matter, and the structure of the Milky Way.</p>
<p>“DR1 already gave the DESI collaboration hints that we might need to rethink our standard model of cosmology,” said Stephen Bailey, a scientist who leads data management for DESI and works at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab). “But these world-class datasets are also valuable for the rest of the astronomy community to test a huge wealth of other ideas, and we’re excited to see the breadth of research that will come out.”</p>

    <p><span>DESI is an international experiment that brings together more than 900 researchers from over 70 institutions. The project is led by Berkeley Lab, and the instrument was constructed and is operated with funding from the DOE Office of Science. DESI is mounted on the U.S. National Science Foundation’s Nicholas U. Mayall 4-meter Telescope at </span><a href="https://kpno.noirlab.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Kitt Peak National Observatory</span></a><span> (a program of NSF NOIRLab) in Arizona.</span></p>
<p><span>DESI’s data release </span><a href="https://data.desi.lbl.gov/doc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>is free and available to access</span></a><span> through the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (</span><a href="https://www.nersc.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>NERSC</span></a><span>), a facility at Berkeley Lab where DESI processes and stores data. Space fans can also explore some of DESI’s data through an interactive portal: the </span><a href="https://www.legacysurvey.org/viewer/desi-dr1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Legacy Survey Sky Browser.</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The new dataset vastly expands </span><a href="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2023/06/13/desi-early-data-release-holds-nearly-two-million-objects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>DESI’s Early Data Release</span></a><span> (EDR), containing roughly 10 times as much data and covering seven times the area of sky. DR1 includes information from the first year of the “main survey” collected between May 2021 and June 2022, as well as from the preceding five-month “survey validation” where researchers tested the experiment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Objects in DESI’s catalog range from nearby stars in our own Milky Way to galaxies billions of light-years away. Because of the time it takes light to travel to Earth, looking out in space is akin to looking back in time. DESI lets us see our universe at different ages, from the present day to 11 billion years ago.</span></p>

    <p><span>Although DR1 is just a fraction of what DESI will eventually produce, the 270-terabyte dataset represents a staggering amount of information, including precise distances to millions of galaxies. The release contains more than twice as many extragalactic objects (those found outside our galaxy) as have been collected in all previous 3D surveys combined.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Within its first year of operations, DESI became the single largest spectroscopic redshift survey ever conducted, sometimes capturing data on more than 1 million objects in a single month. For comparison, its predecessor, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), collected light from 9 million unique objects over roughly 25 years of operations. In 2024, DESI researchers used the data in DR1 to create </span><a href="https://newscenter.lbl.gov/2024/04/04/desi-first-results-make-most-precise-measurement-of-expanding-universe/"><span>the largest 3D map of our universe</span></a><span> to date and make world-leading measurements of dark energy.</span></p>
<p><span>“The DESI project has maintained the pace of making 3D maps of the universe that are 10 times larger every decade,” said David Schlegel, one of the lead scientists at Berkeley Lab for both DESI and SDSS. “That’s our version of Moore’s Law for cosmology surveys. The rapid advance is powered by the clever combination of improved instrument designs, technologies, and analysis of ever-fainter galaxies.”</span></p>
<h2>Large-scale science for a large-scale audience</h2>
<p><span>DESI collects light from distant galaxies by using 5,000 fiber-optic “eyes.” Under clear observing conditions, the instrument can gather a new set of 5,000 objects roughly every 20 minutes, or more than 100,000 galaxies in one night. “DESI is unlike any other machine in terms of its ability to observe independent objects simultaneously,” said John Moustakas, a professor of physics at Siena College and co-lead of DR1.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The instrument separates the light from each galaxy into its spectrum of colors. This lets researchers determine how much the light has been “redshifted,” or stretched toward the red end of the spectrum by the universe’s expansion. Measuring the redshift of light from a distant object tells scientists how far away it is, meaning DESI can map the cosmos in three dimensions and reconstruct a detailed history of cosmic growth.</span></p>

    <p><span>Every night, the images taken by DESI are automatically transferred to supercomputers at NERSC. The facility analyzes the data and sends them back to the researchers — a process they’re proud to advertise as “redshifts before breakfast.” This data transfer takes place via </span><a href="https://www.es.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>ESnet</span></a><span>, the DOE’s dedicated high-speed network for science. The approach represents a new way of doing research where experimental facilities and data analysis are tightly coupled. This ecosystem forms an integrated research infrastructure that drastically accelerates the pace of science.</span></p>
<p><span>“For this data release, we made it so DESI could run on our most advanced supercomputer, </span><i><span>Perlmutter</span></i><span>,” said Daniel Margala, a scientific data architect at NERSC and part of the team that supports the DESI data processing. The transition to </span><i><span>Perlmutter</span></i><span> lets researchers take advantage of the supercomputer’s powerful GPUs (graphics processing units), processing the data nearly 40 times faster than was possible on previous NERSC systems. “What would have taken months on Cori [a prior-generation supercomputer] takes only weeks on </span><i><span>Perlmutter</span></i><span>.”</span></p>
<p><span>Even though they analyze data every night, researchers are always making improvements to their code to get the most possible information out of the light they collect. Once they hit a milestone, like collecting data for one year, they reprocess the full dataset with the best version of the code. It took about a month to crunch the DR1 dataset on </span><i><span>Perlmutter</span></i><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>That speed will be important as DESI collects even more data. The project is currently in its fourth of five years of data collection and aims to record spectra for more than 50 million galaxies and quasars before it ends.</span></p>

                        Given one or more input images, we generate multi-view Splatter Images.
                        To do so, we first generate the scene appearance and geometry using a multi-view diffusion
                        model.
                        Then, Splatter Images are regressed using a Gaussian Head.
                        3D Gaussians from multiple Splatter Images are combined to form the 3D scene.

                            The key to generating high-quality 3D scenes with a latent diffusion model is our Geometry
                            VAE,
                            capable of compressing pointmaps with high accuracy.
                            We find empirically that our VAE with a transformer decoder is more appropriate for
                            autoencoding pointmaps
                            than a VAE with a convolutional decoder or a VAE pre-trained for autoencoding images.
                            Below we visualize colored point clouds using (1) Pointmaps from data, (2) Pointmaps
                            autoencoded with our VAE,

                        Our method gives feed-forward 3D reconstruction models generative capabilities,
                        and significantly reduces inference cost compared to optimization-based methods.

### CONTEXT
You are a research assistant that can search the web.
Question: {question}
Previous Research: {context}

### ACTION SPACE
[1] search
  Description: Look up more information on the web
  Parameters:
    - query (str): What to search for

[2] answer
  Description: Answer the question with current knowledge
  Parameters:
    - answer (str): Final answer to the question

## NEXT ACTION
Decide the next action based on the context and available actions.
Return your response in this format:

action: search OR answer
reason: &lt;why you chose this action&gt;

        # Simply get the search query we saved earlier
        return shared["search_query"]</code></code></pre><p><span>The </span><code>prep</code><span> method here just grabs the search query that was saved by the DecideAction node.</span></p><pre><code><code>    def exec(self, search_query):

shared = {"question": "What is the capital of France?"}

# Run our flow!
flow.run(shared)

  The question is asking about the capital of France. I don't have any prior search results to work with.
  To answer this question accurately, I should search for information about France's capital.
action: search
reason: I need to look up information about the capital of France
search_query: capital of France</code></code></pre><p>Our agent decides it doesn't know enough yet, so it needs to search for information.</p><p>The SearchWeb node now searches for "capital of France" and gets these results:</p><pre><code><code>Results for: capital of France
- The capital of France is Paris
- Paris is known as the City of Light</code></code></pre><p>It saves these results to our shared context.</p><p>Our agent looks at the question again, but now it has some search results:</p><pre><code><code>thinking: |
  Now I have search results that clearly state "The capital of France is Paris".
  This directly answers the question, so I can provide a final answer.
action: answer
reason: I now have the information needed to answer the question</code></code></pre><p>This time, our agent decides it has enough information to answer!</p><p>Finally, the AnswerQuestion node generates a helpful response:</p><pre><code><code>The capital of France is Paris, which is also known as the City of Light.</code></code></pre><p>And we're done! Our agent has successfully:</p><ol><li><p>Realized it needed to search for information</p></li><li><p>Performed a search</p></li><li><p>Decided it had enough information</p></li><li><p>Generated a helpful answer</p></li></ol><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34da5ff1-228a-4725-9037-95f9d6931e34_800x552.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34da5ff1-228a-4725-9037-95f9d6931e34_800x552.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34da5ff1-228a-4725-9037-95f9d6931e34_800x552.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34da5ff1-228a-4725-9037-95f9d6931e34_800x552.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34da5ff1-228a-4725-9037-95f9d6931e34_800x552.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34da5ff1-228a-4725-9037-95f9d6931e34_800x552.jpeg" width="800" height="552" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/34da5ff1-228a-4725-9037-95f9d6931e34_800x552.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:552,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;The Whole Process Visualized&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="The Whole Process Visualized" title="The Whole Process Visualized" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34da5ff1-228a-4725-9037-95f9d6931e34_800x552.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34da5ff1-228a-4725-9037-95f9d6931e34_800x552.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34da5ff1-228a-4725-9037-95f9d6931e34_800x552.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34da5ff1-228a-4725-9037-95f9d6931e34_800x552.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>If you’re technically inclined and want to read or experiment with the complete code for this tutorial, you can find it </span><a href="https://github.com/The-Pocket/PocketFlow/tree/main/cookbook/pocketflow-agent" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">here</a><span>!</span></p><p>You can also see how this same loop-and-branch pattern appears in larger frameworks by checking out these snippets:</p><ul><li><p><strong>OpenAI Agents</strong><span>: </span><a href="https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/blob/48ff99bb736249e99251eb2c7ecf00237488c17a/src/agents/run.py#L119" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">run.py#L119</a><span> for a workflow in graph.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Pydantic Agents</strong><span>: </span><a href="https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/blob/4c0f384a0626299382c22a8e3372638885e18286/pydantic_ai_slim/pydantic_ai/_agent_graph.py#L779" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">_agent_graph.py#L779</a><span> organizes steps in a graph.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Langchain</strong><span>: </span><a href="https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/4d1d726e61ed58b39278903262d19bbe9f010772/libs/langchain/langchain/agents/agent_iterator.py#L174" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">agent_iterator.py#L174</a><span> demonstrates the loop structure.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>LangGraph</strong><span>: </span><a href="https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph/blob/24f7d7c4399e2c19b634ed7af0d551ad327e25d7/libs/cli/examples/graphs/agent.py#L56" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">agent.py#L56</a><span> for a graph-based approach.</span></p></li></ul><p><span>Now you know the secret -

AMD and Nvidia’s SAs and GPCs all pack a lot more than four cores. For example, the RX 6900XT’s Shader Engines each have 10 WGPs. Nvidia’s RTX 4090 puts eight SMs in each GPC. GPUs have become more compute-heavy over time, as games use more complex shader programs. Intel seems to be following the same trend.</p><p>Xe Vector Engines (XVEs) execute shader programs on Intel GPUs. They use a combination of vector-level and thread-level parallelism to hide latency.</p><p>Xe3 XVEs can run 10 threads concurrently, up from eight in prior generations. Like SMT on a CPU, tracking multiple threads helps a XVE hide latency using thread level parallelism. If one thread stalls, the XVE can hopefully find an un-stalled thread to issue instructions from. Active thread count is also referred to as thread occupancy. 100% occupancy on a GPU would be analogous to 100% utilization in Windows Task Manager. Unlike CPU SMT implementations, GPU occupancy can be limited by register file capacity.</p><p><span>Prior Intel GPUs had two register allocation modes. Normally each thread gets 128 512-bit registers, for 8 KB of registers per thread. A “large GRF” mode gives each thread 256 registers, but drops occupancy to 4 threads because of register file capacity limits. Xe3 continues to use 64 KB register files per XVE, but flexibly allocates registers in 32 entry blocks</span><sup>2</sup><span>. That lets Xe3’s XVEs get 10 threads in flight as long as each thread uses 96 or fewer registers. If a shader program needs a lot of registers, occupancy degrades more gracefully than in prior generations.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e7d6b46-e13e-4eb2-8e48-761fb89584ca_984x516.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e7d6b46-e13e-4eb2-8e48-761fb89584ca_984x516.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e7d6b46-e13e-4eb2-8e48-761fb89584ca_984x516.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e7d6b46-e13e-4eb2-8e48-761fb89584ca_984x516.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e7d6b46-e13e-4eb2-8e48-761fb89584ca_984x516.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e7d6b46-e13e-4eb2-8e48-761fb89584ca_984x516.png" width="984" height="516" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9e7d6b46-e13e-4eb2-8e48-761fb89584ca_984x516.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:516,&quot;width&quot;:984,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:21036,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/159384594?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e7d6b46-e13e-4eb2-8e48-761fb89584ca_984x516.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e7d6b46-e13e-4eb2-8e48-761fb89584ca_984x516.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e7d6b46-e13e-4eb2-8e48-761fb89584ca_984x516.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e7d6b46-e13e-4eb2-8e48-761fb89584ca_984x516.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e7d6b46-e13e-4eb2-8e48-761fb89584ca_984x516.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Nvidia and AMD GPUs allocate registers at even finer granularity. AMD’s RDNA 2 for example allocates registers in blocks of 16. But Xe3 is still more flexible than prior Intel generations. With this change, simple shaders that only need a few registers will enjoy better latency tolerance from more thread-level parallelism. And more complex shaders can avoid dropping to the “large GRF” mode.</p><p>Xe3’s XVEs have more scoreboard tokens too. Like AMD and Nvidia, Intel uses compiler assisted scheduling for long latency instructions like memory accesses. A long latency instruction can set a scoreboard entry, and a dependent instruction can wait until that entry is cleared. Each Xe3 thread gets 32 scoreboard tokens regardless of occupancy, so a XVE has 320 scoreboard tokens in total. On Xe2, a thread gets 16 tokens if the XVE is running eight threads, or 32 in “large GRF” mode with four threads. Thus Xe2’s XVEs only have 128 scoreboard tokens in total. More tokens let thread have more outstanding long latency instructions. That very likely translates to more memory level parallelism per thread.</p><p><span>Intel’s GPU ISA has a vector register file (GRF, or General Register File) that stores much of a shader program’s data and feeds the vector execution units. It also has an “Architecture Register File” (ARF) with special registers. Some of those can store data, like the accumulator registers. But others serve special purposes. For example, </span><code>sr0</code><span> as mentioned above provides GPU topology info, along with floating point exception state and thread priority. A 32-bit instruction pointer points to the current instruction address, relative to the instruction base address.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81871181-da97-4ab2-9da6-549db0ceef55_980x494.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81871181-da97-4ab2-9da6-549db0ceef55_980x494.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81871181-da97-4ab2-9da6-549db0ceef55_980x494.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81871181-da97-4ab2-9da6-549db0ceef55_980x494.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81871181-da97-4ab2-9da6-549db0ceef55_980x494.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81871181-da97-4ab2-9da6-549db0ceef55_980x494.png" width="980" height="494" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/81871181-da97-4ab2-9da6-549db0ceef55_980x494.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:494,&quot;width&quot;:980,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:43768,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/159384594?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81871181-da97-4ab2-9da6-549db0ceef55_980x494.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81871181-da97-4ab2-9da6-549db0ceef55_980x494.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81871181-da97-4ab2-9da6-549db0ceef55_980x494.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81871181-da97-4ab2-9da6-549db0ceef55_980x494.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81871181-da97-4ab2-9da6-549db0ceef55_980x494.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Notes on Intel’s ARF, with changes from Xe2 to Xe3 in blue</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Xe3 adds a “Scalar Register” (</span><code>s0</code><span>) to the ARF</span><sup>6</sup><span>. </span><code>s0</code><span> is laid out much like the address register (</span><code>a0</code><span>), and is used for gather-send instructions.

Intel’s paper calls out foliage as an example, noting that programmers may use low vertex counts to reduce “rendering, animation, and even simulation run times.”</span><sup>7</sup><span> BVH geometry from the API perspective can only be completely </span><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/DirectX-Specs/d3d/Raytracing.html#d3d12_raytracing_geometry_flags" rel="">transparent or opaque</a><span>, so games mark all partially transparent primitives as transparent. Each ray intersection will fire an any-hit shader, which carries out alpha testing. If alpha testing indicates the ray intersected a transparent part of the primitive, the shader program doesn’t contribute a sample and the any-hit shader launch is basically wasted. STOC bits let the any-hit shader skip alpha testing if the ray intersects a completely transparent or completely opaque sub-triangle.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ef29734-8af1-4496-9336-4f368bac4e23_1082x311.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ef29734-8af1-4496-9336-4f368bac4e23_1082x311.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ef29734-8af1-4496-9336-4f368bac4e23_1082x311.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ef29734-8af1-4496-9336-4f368bac4e23_1082x311.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ef29734-8af1-4496-9336-4f368bac4e23_1082x311.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ef29734-8af1-4496-9336-4f368bac4e23_1082x311.png" width="1082" height="311" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9ef29734-8af1-4496-9336-4f368bac4e23_1082x311.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:311,&quot;width&quot;:1082,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:59897,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/159384594?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ef29734-8af1-4496-9336-4f368bac4e23_1082x311.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ef29734-8af1-4496-9336-4f368bac4e23_1082x311.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ef29734-8af1-4496-9336-4f368bac4e23_1082x311.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ef29734-8af1-4496-9336-4f368bac4e23_1082x311.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ef29734-8af1-4496-9336-4f368bac4e23_1082x311.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>From Intel's paper, showing examples of foliage textures</figcaption></figure></div><p>Storing each sub-triangle’s opacity information takes two bits, so STOC does require more storage compared to using a single opacity bit for the entire triangle.

Blue = STOC related, purple = non-STOC raytracing data structure changes</figcaption></figure></div><p>A “STOC3” structure takes things further by storing pointers to STOC bits rather than embedding them into the BVH. That allows more flexibility in how much storage the STOC bits can use. STOC3 also specifies recursion levels for STOC bits, possibly for recursively partitioning triangles. Subdividing further would reduce the number of partially transparent sub-triangles, which require alpha testing from the any-hit shader. Storing pointers for STOC3 brings leaf node size to 128 bytes, increasing BVH memory footprint.</p><p>Possible performance gains are exciting, but using STOC requires work from game developers or game engines. Intel suggests that STOC bits can be generated offline as part of game asset compilation. Artists will have to determine whether using STOC will provide a performance uplift for a particular scene. A scene with a lot of foliage might benefit massively from STOC. A chain link fence may be another story. STOC isn’t a part of the DirectX or Vulkan standards, which can be another obstacle to adoption. However, software-only STOC can still provide benefits. That could encourage developers to try it out. If they do implement it, STOC-aware Xe3 hardware stands to gain more than a software-only solution.</p><p>We’re still some time away from real Xe3 products. But software changes suggest Xe3 is another significant step forward for Intel’s graphics architecture. Xe2 was a solid step in Intel’s foray into discrete graphics, providing better performance than Xe with a nominally smaller GPU. Xe3 tweaks the architecture again and likely has similar goals. Higher occupancy and dynamic register allocation would make Xe Cores more latency tolerant, improving utilization. Those changes also bring Intel’s graphics architecture closer to AMD and Nvidia’s.</p><p>XVE changes show Intel is still busy evolving their core compute architecture. In contrast, Nvidia’s Streaming Multiprocessors haven’t seen significant changes from Ampere to Blackwell. Nvidia may have felt Ampere’s SM architecture was good enough, and turned their efforts to tuning features while scaling up the GPU to keep providing generational gains. Intel meanwhile seeks to get more out of each Xe Core (and Xe2 achieved higher performance than Xe with fewer Xe Cores).</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12874222-8008-4367-9262-7a02626cb3b6_810x576.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12874222-8008-4367-9262-7a02626cb3b6_810x576.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12874222-8008-4367-9262-7a02626cb3b6_810x576.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12874222-8008-4367-9262-7a02626cb3b6_810x576.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12874222-8008-4367-9262-7a02626cb3b6_810x576.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12874222-8008-4367-9262-7a02626cb3b6_810x576.jpeg" width="810" height="576" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/12874222-8008-4367-9262-7a02626cb3b6_810x576.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:576,&quot;width&quot;:810,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:166273,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://chipsandcheese.com/i/159384594?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12874222-8008-4367-9262-7a02626cb3b6_810x576.jpeg&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12874222-8008-4367-9262-7a02626cb3b6_810x576.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12874222-8008-4367-9262-7a02626cb3b6_810x576.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12874222-8008-4367-9262-7a02626cb3b6_810x576.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F12874222-8008-4367-9262-7a02626cb3b6_810x576.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Intel Arc logo on a product box</figcaption></figure></div><p>In a similarity with Nvidia, Intel is pushing hard on the features front and evidently has invested into research. GPUs often try to avoid doing wasted work. Just rasterization pipelines use early depth testing to avoid useless pixel shader invocations, STOC avoids spawning useless any-hit shaders. It’s too early to tell what kind of difference STOC or other Xe3 features will make. But anyone doubting Intel’s commitment to moving their GPU architecture forward should take a serious look at Mesa and Intel Graphics Compiler changes. There’s a lot going on, and I look forward to seeing Xe3 whenever it’s ready.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>In a first for space cuisine, ESA project astronaut <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/Astronauts/Slawosz_Uznanski-Wisniewski" target="_blank">Sławosz&nbsp;Uznański-Wiśniewski</a> will bring pierogi, the traditional Polish dumplings, to the International Space Station during the upcoming Axiom Mission 4.</p>

<p>Sławosz is bringing a taste of home to space with a special menu created together with a celebrity chef and a family-owned company in Poland. The food selection includes pierogi stuffed with cabbage and mushrooms, tomato soup with noodles, Polish “leczo” stew with buckwheat, and apple crumble for dessert.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Any food delivered to the <a href="http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/International_Space_Station" target="_blank">International Space Station</a> must be crumb-free, lightweight and keep for at least 24 months.</p>	</div>

		<p>Most of the space menu consists of canned or freeze-dried meals in plastic packages. Fresh fruits and vegetables are a luxury, only available when a spacecraft arrives with new supplies.</p><p>Bonus food catered for specific crew members makes up around 10 percent of their menu. Astronauts say this bonus food adds variety to their dishes, boosts their mental wellbeing and helps them bond with the crew in orbit.</p><p>“I wanted a truly Polish menu that I could share with my fellow astronauts. Food brings psychological comfort, and I instantly thought it would be worth taking some Polish delicacies into orbit,” says Sławosz.</p>	</div>

	<h2>The pierogi challenge</h2>
	    
						
		<p>Pierogi have been part of Polish cuisine since the 13th century. These dumplings remain a staple of Polish home cooking and an essential part of Christmas Eve celebrations.</p><p>“When I heard about the possibility of choosing my bonus food menu, pierogi were always at the top of my list! I like to make them myself,” explains Sławosz.</p>	</div>

		<p>The Polish astronaut, who will be conducting over a dozen technological and scientific experiments during the <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/ignis" target="_blank">Ignis mission</a>, met an unexpected challenge with his beloved pierogi.</p><p>“The first batches kept bursting! It was not only about cooking the food, it was also the technological process behind. It took us a while to master freeze-drying, to remove moisture from the stuffing through the dough and to dispose of the water left after rehydration,” he admits.&nbsp;</p><p>Freeze-drying is a long process that completely removes any water from the food, maintaining its properties and structure for years.</p>	</div>

		<p>An astronaut’s space menu comprises a range of food designed to meet nutritional and operational requirements on board. Teams on the ground start selecting meals months in advance because food must be sent to the lab for safety and nutritional testing after being freeze-dried, thermostabilised or vacuum-packed.</p><p>Before his <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/ignis" target="_blank">Ignis mission</a> takes off, Sławosz participated in several space food tasting sessions and rated food and drinks. This helped determine what dishes will be included in their basic food supply throughout the mission.</p>	</div>
