The futuristic video game by the makers of The Witcher depicts a world full of neon lights and cybernetic enhancements, and it had recently received a big content update. Controller in hand, Park vividly recalls directing a digital Keanu Reeves to try and stop a murder, all while medical tubes protruded from his body. The tubes plugged into a port on his torso, and they were ready to pump chemicals inside. Unlike the digital augments that buffed his video game character, chemotherapy is corrosive in a way that makes the experience invasive, even as it was helping.

In the “mind” of Claude, we found millions of concepts that activate when the model reads relevant text or sees relevant images, which we call “features”.</p><p>One of those was the concept of the Golden Gate Bridge. We found that there’s a specific combination of neurons in Claude’s neural network that activates when it encounters a mention (or a picture) of this most famous San Francisco landmark.</p><p>Not only can we identify these features, we can tune the strength of their activation up or down, and identify corresponding changes in Claude’s behavior.</p><p>And as we <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/scaling-monosemanticity/index.html#:~:text=For%20instance%2C%20we%20see%20that%20clamping%20the%20Golden%20Gate%20Bridge%20feature%2034M/31164353%20to%2010%C3%97%20its%20maximum%20activation%20value%20induces%20thematically%2Drelated%20model%20behavior">explain in our research paper</a>, when we turn up the strength of the “Golden Gate Bridge” feature, Claude’s responses begin to focus on the Golden Gate Bridge. Its replies to most queries start to mention the Golden Gate Bridge, even if it’s not directly relevant.</p><p>If you ask this “Golden Gate Claude” how to spend $10, it will recommend using it to drive across the Golden Gate Bridge and pay the toll. If you ask it to write a love story, it’ll tell you a tale of a car who can’t wait to cross its beloved bridge on a foggy day. If you ask it what it imagines it looks like, it will likely tell you that it imagines it looks like the Golden Gate Bridge.</p><p>For a short time, we’re making this model available for everyone to interact with. You can talk to “Golden Gate Claude” on <a href="https://claude.ai/">claude.ai</a> (just click the Golden Gate logo on the right-hand side). Please bear in mind that this is a research demonstration only, and that this particular model might behave in some unexpected—even jarring—ways.</p><p>Our goal is to let people see the impact our interpretability work can have. The fact that we can find and alter these features within Claude makes us more confident that we’re beginning to understand how large language models really work. This isn’t a matter of asking the model verbally to do some play-acting, or of adding a new “system prompt” that attaches extra text to every input, telling Claude to pretend it’s a bridge. Nor is it traditional “fine-tuning,” where we use extra training data to create a new black box that tweaks the behavior of the old black box. This is a precise, surgical change to some of the most basic aspects of the model’s internal activations.</p><p><a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/scaling-monosemanticity/index.html">As we describe in our paper</a>, we can use these same techniques to change the strength of <em>safety-related</em> features—like those related to dangerous computer code, criminal activity, or deception. With further research, we believe this work could help make AI models safer.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Gordon Moore’s famous prediction about computing power must count as one of the most astonishingly accurate forecasts in history. But it may also have been badly misunderstood — in a way that now looks like a near-catastrophic missed opportunity. If we had grasped the details behind Moore’s Law in the 1980s, we could be living with an abundance of clean energy by now. We fumbled it. </p>



<p>A refresher on Moore’s Law: in 1965, electronics engineer Gordon Moore published an article noting that the number of components that could efficiently be put on an integrated circuit was roughly doubling every year. “Over the short term this rate can be expected to continue, if not increase,” he wrote. “There is no reason to believe it will not remain nearly constant for at least 10 years. That means, by 1975, the number of components per integrated circuit for minimum cost will be 65,000.” </p>



<p>That component number is now well into the billions. Moore adjusted his prediction in 1975 to doubling every two years, and the revised law has remained broadly true ever since, not only for the density of computer components but for the cost, speed and power consumption of computation itself. The question is, why? </p>



<p>The way Moore formulated the law, it was just something that happened: the sun rises and sets, the leaves that are green turn to brown, and computers get faster and cheaper. </p>



<p>But there’s another way to describe technological progress, and it might be better if we talked less about Moore’s Law, and more about Wright’s Law. Theodore Wright was an aeronautical engineer who, in the 1930s, published a Moore-like observation about aeroplanes: they were getting cheaper in a predictable way. Wright found that the second of any particular model of aeroplane would be 20 per cent cheaper to make than the first, the fourth would be 20 per cent cheaper than the second, and every time cumulative production doubled, the cost of making an additional unit would drop by a further 20 per cent. </p>



<p>A key difference is that Moore’s Law is a function of time, but Wright’s Law is a function of activity: the more you make, the cheaper it gets. What’s more, Wright’s Law applies to a huge range of technologies: what varies is the 20 per cent figure. Some technologies resist cost improvements. Others, such as solar photovoltaic modules, become much cheaper as production ramps up. </p>



<p>In a new book, <a href="https://amzn.to/3UAE3Jp">Making Sense of Chaos</a>, the complexity scientist Doyne Farmer points out that both Moore’s Law and Wright’s Law provide a good basis for forecasting the costs of different technologies. Both nicely describe the patterns that we see in the data. But which one is closer to identifying the underlying causes of these patterns? Moore’s Law suggests that products get cheaper over time, and because they are cheaper they then are demanded and produced in larger quantities. Wright’s Law suggests that rather than falling costs spurring production, it’s mass production that causes costs to fall. </p>



<p>And therein lies the missed opportunity. We acted as though Moore’s Law governed the cost of photovoltaics. While there were of course subsidies for solar PV in countries such as Germany, the default view was that it was too expensive to be much use as a large-scale power source, so we should wait and hope that it would eventually become cheap. If instead we had looked through the lens of Wright’s Law, governments should have been falling over themselves to buy or otherwise subsidise expensive solar PV, because the more we bought, the faster the price would fall. </p>



<p>PV is now so cheap that the question is moot. Yet if we had acted more boldly 40 years ago, solar PV might have been cheap enough to put fossil fuels out of business at the turn of the millennium. </p>



<p>That, of course, presupposes that Wright’s Law really does apply. It might not. Perhaps technological progress depends more on a stream of results from university research labs, and cannot be rushed — in which case, patience is the relevant virtue and a huge splurge on new technologies would be a waste of money. </p>



<p>So — Moore’s Law, or Wright’s Law? Farmer and his colleagues Diana Greenwald and François Lafond turned to the second world war for data. After 1939, the US vastly expanded production of military hardware, from radar to blankets. We can be confident that this was because of the wartime needs of the US and its allies, not because President Roosevelt noticed that tank manufacturers were offering some great discounts. Across a large range of products, Farmer, Greenwald and Lafond found that Wright’s Law explained about half of the fall in production costs during the war. </p>



<p>As Farmer writes, “we can say with some confidence that increasing cumulative production can drive prices down, even if this is not the full story”. Buy more, and they get cheaper. </p>



<p>Wright’s Law isn’t magic, and although it seems to apply to many products, it is rare for the price declines on offer to be as spectacular as those for aeroplanes, solar PV and computer chips. Still, where the data suggest that Wright’s Law holds strongly, governments can drive down prices by subsidising production or demand, one way or another. The individual incentive, after all, is to be a late adopter. </p>



<p>Moore himself saw his own prediction as a challenge, and co-founded the chip manufacturer Intel. Ironically, Moore seems to have been more of a follower of Wright’s Law. Moore’s Law suggests that good things come to those who wait. Wright’s Law says that good things come to those who act.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Spotify’s brief attempt at being a hardware company wasn’t all that successful: the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/27/23280357/spotify-stops-manufacturing-car-thing-q2-2022-earnings">stopped producing its Car Thing</a> dashboard accessory less than a year after it went on sale to the public. And now, two years later, the device is about to be rendered completely inoperable. Customers who bought the Car Thing are receiving emails warning that it will stop working altogether as of December 9th.</p><p>Unfortunately for those owners, Spotify isn’t offering any kind of subscription credit or automatic refund for the device — nor is the company open-sourcing it. Rather, it’s just canning the project and telling people to (responsibly) dispose of Car Thing.</p><p>“We’re discontinuing Car Thing as part of our ongoing efforts to streamline our product offerings,” Spotify wrote in <a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/article/car-thing-discontinued/">an FAQ on its website</a>. “We understand it may be disappointing, but this decision allows us to focus on developing new features and enhancements that will ultimately provide a better experience to all Spotify users.”</p><p>The company is recommending that customers do a factory reset on the product and find some way of responsibly recycling the hardware. Spotify is also being direct and confirming that there’s little reason to ever expect a sequel. “As of now, there are no plans to release a replacement or new version of Car Thing,” the FAQ reads.</p><div><p>Car Thing was initially made available on an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22380014/spotify-car-thing-release-voice-control-data-interactive-ads">invite-only basis in April 2021</a>, with Spotify later opening a public waitlist to buy the accessory&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22726497/spotify-car-thing-hardware-waitlist">later that year</a>. The $90 device went on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/22/22945403/spotify-car-thing-price-release-date">general sale in February 2022</a> — and production was halted five months later.</p></div><p>The Car Thing hardware was quite nice considering it was Spotify’s first go, but the product was more of a remote control for Spotify on your mobile phone than any kind of standalone player. That limited its appeal, though the device <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CarThing/">still found a niche community</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>“We held a series of workshops with members of the construction industry on how we could reduce emissions from the sector,” said <a href="https://www.uselessgroup.org/">Professor Julian Allwood</a> from Cambridge’s Department of Engineering, who led the research. “Lots of great ideas came out of those discussions, but one thing they couldn’t or wouldn’t consider was a world without cement.”</p>
                <p>Concrete is made from sand, gravel, water, and cement, which serves as a binder. Although it’s a small proportion of concrete, cement is responsible for almost 90% of concrete emissions. Cement is made through a process called clinkering, where limestone and other raw materials are crushed and heated to about 1,450°C in large kilns. This process converts the materials into cement, but releases large amounts of CO₂ as limestone decarbonates into lime.</p>
                <p>Over the past decade, scientists have been investigating substitutes for cement, and have found that roughly half of the cement in concrete can be replaced with alternative materials, such as fly ash, but these alternatives need to be chemically activated by the remaining cement in order to harden.</p>
                <p>“It’s also a question of volume – we don’t physically have enough of these alternatives to keep up with global cement demand, which is roughly four billion tonnes per year,” said Allwood. “We’ve already identified the low hanging fruit that helps us use less cement by careful mixing and blending, but to get all the way to zero emissions, we need to start thinking outside the box.”</p>
                <p>“I had a vague idea from previous work that if it were possible to crush old concrete, taking out the sand and stones, heating the cement would remove the water, and then it would form clinker again,” said first author Dr Cyrille Dunant, also from the Department of Engineering. “A bath of liquid metal would help this chemical reaction along, and an electric arc furnace, used to recycle steel, felt like a strong possibility. We had to try.”</p>
                <p>The clinkering process requires heat and the right combination of oxides, all of which are in used cement, but need to be reactivated. The researchers tested a range of slags, made from demolition waste and added lime, alumina and silica. The slags were processed in the Materials Processing Institute’s EAF with molten steel and rapidly cooled.</p>
                <p>“We found the combination of cement clinker and iron oxide is an excellent steelmaking slag because it foams and it flows well,” said Dunant. “And if you get the balance right and cool the slag quickly enough, you end up with reactivated cement, without adding any cost to the steelmaking process.”</p>
                <p>The cement made through this recycling process contains higher levels of iron oxide than conventional cement, but the researchers say this has little effect on performance.</p>
                <p>The<a href="https://cambridgeelectriccement.com/"> Cambridge Electric Cement</a> process has been scaling rapidly, and the researchers say they could be producing one billion tonnes per year by 2050, which represents roughly a quarter of current annual cement production.</p>
                <p>“Producing zero emissions cement is an absolute miracle, but we’ve also got to reduce the amount of cement and concrete we use,” said Allwood. “Concrete is cheap, strong and can be made almost anywhere, but we just use far too much of it. We could dramatically reduce the amount of concrete we use without any reduction in safety, but there needs to be political will to make that happen.</p>
                <p>“As well as being a breakthrough for the construction industry, we hope that Cambridge Electric Cement will also be a flag to help the government recognise that the opportunities for innovation on our journey to zero emissions extend far beyond the energy sector.”</p>
                <p>The researchers have filed a patent on the process to support its commercialisation. The research was supported in part by Innovate UK and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). Julian Allwood is a Fellow of St Catharine’s College, Cambridge.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://wasmer.io/posts/running-php-blazingly-fast-at-the-edge-with-wasm">https://wasmer.io/posts/running-php-blazingly-fast-at-the-edge-with-wasm</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40457229">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PHP currently powers <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl-php">~75% of the websites</a> on the internet. It may not be the “sexy boi” of programming languages… but it has been an important actor since the internet's birth and our pulse to use it for sharing memes and cat images.
Starting today, in open beta, you’ll be able to run PHP fully in Wasmer and <a href="https://wasmer.io/products/edge">Wasmer Edge</a>.</p>
<p><em>But …why is running PHP in WebAssembly important?</em> Thanks to the properties of WebAssembly, we can safely restrict the resources that the program can access, and as such… we can run PHP safely without the overhead of OS or hardware virtualization.</p>
<p>The support for PHP in WebAssembly arrives after countless hours of work from the Wasmer team (Arshia and Amin in particular!) working to make PHP run flawlessly and as fast as possible.
<em>TL;DR: we got up to 3x faster speeds by enabling opcode caching inside WebAssembly, a feat never achieved before!</em></p>
<p>Bringing serverless-like scalability to any PHP app can unlock immense value, allowing you to run your PHP apps in the Edge and pay a fraction of the price that cloud providers charge.</p>
<p>This also means that you can run every PHP application out there with Wasmer without ever worrying that the app will break sandboxing and do harmful things they shouldn’t be able to.</p>
<p>You can now run the most popular PHP frameworks in Wasmer and Wasmer Edge:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wasmer.io/templates/wordpress-starter">WordPress</a> (<a href="https://wordpress-wasmer-examples.wasmer.app/">demo in Wasmer Edge</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://wasmer.io/templates/symfony-starter">Symfony</a> (<a href="https://symfony-wasmer-examples.wasmer.app/">demo in Wasmer Edge</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://wasmer.io/templates/laravel-starter">Laravel</a> (<a href="https://laravel-wasmer-examples.wasmer.app/">demo in Wasmer Edge</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>All PHP templates: <a href="https://wasmer.io/templates?language=php">https://wasmer.io/templates?language=php</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Wasmer Edge support for custom filesystem volumes is on the way. The deployed apps that are using SQLite (such as Wordpress or Symfony), currently only store database changes memory, not yet permanently.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To squeeze the max out of WebAssembly and PHP we have been able to enable opcode caching, allowing Wasmer to run WordPress without any modification, at 3x the speed… going from 600ms to a reasonable 200ms to render a basic blogpost page.</p>
<p><img src="https://wasmer.io/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.wasmer.io%2Fimages%2FScreenshot_2024-05-23_at_3.09.40_PM.original.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75" alt="WebAssembly in PHP Wasm vs Native with opcode cache enabled"></p>
<p>Do you want to try it?</p>
<p>If normally you would do:</p>
<pre><code> php -S localhost:8000 .
</code></pre>
<p>You can now simply run it fully sandboxed via Wasmer with:</p>
<pre><code>wasmer run php/php --mapdir:/app:. -- /app -S localhost:8000
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>You can also run wordpress locally easily. Just clone the Wordpress repo: <a href="https://github.com/wasmer-examples/wordpress-wasmer-starter">https://github.com/wasmer-examples/wordpress-wasmer-starter</a> and run <code>wasmer run . --net</code> on the root! Note: you’ll need Wasmer 4.3.1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And there you go… a fully functional PHP CLI running in your server, and fully sandboxed! You don’t have to worry anymore that the app will have access to your <code>/etc/passwd</code> or your precious bitcoins!</p>
<p>Welcome to the new frontier, where the software that we know and love can be compiled and run in a way that is fully sandboxed.</p>
<h2>Technical feats</h2>
<p>Getting PHP to work flawlessly in Wasm with Wasmer was not an easy feat. We solved many problems along the process:</p>
<ul>
<li>We found an obscure bug in our <code>longjmp</code>/<code>setjmp</code> implementation (required to have try/catch statements within PHP), where the stack was being overwritten and not properly restored</li>
<li>We discovered and fixed a bug slowing down outgoing HTTP calls by a 10x factor</li>
<li>We enabled PHP <code>opcache</code> by default, allowing up to 3x faster PHP times</li>
<li>Many small fixes on the filesystem virtualization layer and networking (oh, IPv6 our dear friend!)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have followed our previous blogpost on running WordPress with Wasmer, you may have realized that we have had to do countless code adaptations (a.k.a. <em>hacks</em>) in WordPress to change its behavior and not trigger a blocking edge case. Namely, these are all the <em>hacks</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>We had to standardize calls to the <code>exit</code> function: <a href="https://github.com/wasmerio/wcgi-wordpress-demo/commit/9116a7ba25bb14cc50f1a18b81490929347c8462">https://github.com/wasmerio/wcgi-wordpress-demo/commit/9116a7ba25bb14cc50f1a18b81490929347c8462</a></li>
<li>We had to comment out any fetch calls: <a href="https://github.com/wasmerio/wcgi-wordpress-demo/commit/ef1550ba3cce4fb6882a738d8409aacbc09784f0">https://github.com/wasmerio/wcgi-wordpress-demo/commit/ef1550ba3cce4fb6882a738d8409aacbc09784f0</a></li>
<li>We served the static assets using the PHP interpreter (there’s code I’ve been more proud of than this one! <a href="https://github.com/wasmerio/wcgi-wordpress-demo/blob/main/app/hacks.php#L44-L150">https://github.com/wasmerio/wcgi-wordpress-demo/blob/main/app/hacks.php#L44-L150</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>As of today, none of those <em>hacks</em> are needed any longer.</p>
<p>The good news is that on the latest release of Wasmer, <strong>WordPress, Laravel, and Symfony run in Wasmer without any code modification</strong> whatsoever.</p>
<p>We are incredibly happy with this because running those frameworks successfully with no modifications required also means that Wasmer will likely be able to run every PHP program out there.</p>
<h2>But… how fast is it?</h2>
<p>Just running PHP at baseline speeds was not enough for our use case, we wanted to run it as fast as humanly possible in WebAssembly.</p>
<p>Thankfully for us, PHP has one module that makes its execution much faster: the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.opcache.php">Zend Opcache</a>. The Opcode caching module works by optimizing and caching the bytecode that the PHP source is transformed into, thus saving time by not parsing the AST of the files that have already been processed.</p>
<p>Opcode caching can bring a 3x speed up to the number of requests an app can handle, so it seemed obvious to enable it on WebAssembly.</p>
<p>However, opcode caching (and Zend module loading) was disabled by default (as it requires <code>dlopen</code>, <code>dlsym</code>, and more support in Wasm, which is not available).</p>
<p>So we set on a unique quest: enabling opcode caching in PHP.</p>
<p>After some research, we found one novel way of doing it, and we were up for the races: we found a way to statically link it, and had to fix a bunch of things along the way… but we got it running at the end!</p>
<p>Here are the timings of WordPress without Opcache in Wasm: ~620ms</p>
<p>And the timings of WordPress with Opcache enabled in Wasm: ~205ms</p>
<p><strong>That’s a 3x speedup just by enabling Opcache!</strong></p>
<p>While doing the work, we also realized there are even further improvements that we can make to PHP to bring it close to native speeds. Stay tuned!</p>
<p>Our work opens up even more avenues for projects that are currently relying on Emscripten to run PHP in the browser, such as the <a href="https://wordpress.org/playground/">WordPress playground</a>, allowing those projects to work with packages that can run both in the browser and in the Edge!</p>
<hr>
<p>But this is not all: we are working on a completely revolutionary approach to cold-starts that will supersede any other provider by a big factor (Cloudflare &amp; Fly.io, we are looking at you!)… exciting times are coming to the Edge market.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hi HN! Porter Cloud (<a href="https://porter.run/porter-cloud">https://porter.run/porter-cloud</a>) is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) like Heroku, but we make it easy for you to migrate to AWS, Azure, or GCP when you're ready.</p><p>Like Heroku, Porter takes care of a lot of generic DevOps work for you (like setting up CI/CD, containerizing your applications, autoscaling, SSL certificates, setting up a reverse proxy) and lets you deploy your apps with a few clicks — saving you a lot of time while developing. However, as you probably know, there’s a downside: platforms like this become constraining if and when your app takes off and you need to scale. The time you saved while developing can get pretty expensive once you’re paying for a lot of users — and the platforms tend to try to keep you locked in!</p><p>Our idea is to give you the best of both worlds: use Porter Cloud for as long as it saves you time and development cost, but at any time you can press the “eject button” to migrate your app to your own AWS, Azure, or GCP account as you please. We make it seamless to break out, so you’re no longer subject to the rigid constraints of a conventional PaaS. You can migrate in a few simple steps outlined here: <a href="https://docs.porter.run/other/eject">https://docs.porter.run/other/eject</a>.</p><p>A bit of background: we first launched on HN almost 3 years ago with our original product (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26993421">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26993421</a>, <a href="https://porter.run/">https://porter.run</a>), which deploys your applications to your own AWS, Azure, or GCP account with the simple experience of a PaaS.</p><p>Since then, we’ve helped countless companies migrate from a PaaS to one of the big three cloud providers. Most of them had gotten started on a PaaS in the early days to optimize for speed and ease of use, but ultimately had to go through a painful migration to AWS, Azure, or GCP as they scaled and ran into various constraints on their original PaaS.</p><p>Interestingly, we learned that many companies that start on a PaaS are fully aware that they’ll have to migrate to one of the big three public clouds [1] at some point. Yet they choose to deploy on a PaaS anyway because outgrowing a cloud platform is a “champagne problem” when you’re focused on getting something off the ground. This, however, becomes a very tangible problem when you need to migrate your entire production infrastructure while serving many users at scale. It’s a “nice problem to have”, until it isn’t.</p><p>We’ve built Porter Cloud so that the next generation of startups can get off the ground as quickly as possible, with a peace of mind that you can effortlessly move to one of the tried and true hyperscalers when you are ready to scale.</p><p>We are excited to see what people build on Porter Cloud. If you’ve ever dealt with a migration from a PaaS to one of the big three cloud providers, we’d also love to hear about your experience in the comments. Looking forward to feedback and discussion!</p><p>[1] By “big three clouds” we mean the lower-level primitives of each cloud provider. We don’t mean their higher level offerings like AWS App Runner, Google Cloud Run, or Azure App Service, since those run into the same PaaS problems described above.</p></div></td></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
<p>Two years ago we launched iFixit’s Samsung Repair Hub with the goal of building an incredible, repair-friendly ecosystem. We aimed to set the gold standard for repair documentation and empower local independent repair businesses with the tools and parts they needed to thrive, all while keeping Galaxy devices running.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite our best efforts, we have not been able to deliver on that promise.</p>



<p>As we tried to build this ecosystem we consistently faced obstacles that made us doubt Samsung’s commitment to making repair more accessible. We couldn’t get parts to local repair shops at prices and quantities that made business sense. The part prices were so costly that many consumers opted to replace their devices rather than repair them. And the design of Samsung’s Galaxy devices remained frustratingly glued together, forcing us to sell batteries and screens in pre-glued bundles that increased the cost.</p>



<p>It’s with a heavy wrench that we have decided to end our <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/62839/were-building-a-galaxy-of-repair-with-samsung">partnership with Samsung</a>. Despite a huge amount of effort, Samsung’s approach to repairability does not align with our mission. This means:</p>



<ul>
<li>Starting June 2024, iFixit will no longer be Samsung’s designated third-party parts and tools distributor.</li>



<li>Also starting next month, we will no longer have a quantity limit of seven Samsung parts per repair shop per quarter.</li>



<li>No existing information will be removed from iFixit, but we will not collaborate directly with Samsung to develop new manuals.</li>



<li>We will continue to <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Parts/Samsung_Android_Phone">sell parts and repair fix kits</a> for Samsung devices, sourcing OEM parts when available and clearly indicating whether parts are original or aftermarket. Just like we do for <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Parts/iPhone">Apple repair parts</a>.</li>
</ul>






<p><strong>Continuing Our Mission</strong></p>



<p>Though we are sad that Samsung isn’t coming along, we’re continuing our march into a more-repairable future. We’re shipping more parts to people all over the world, expanding awareness of third-party repair, and proving to <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/56078/ifixit-works-with-microsoft-to-manufacture-service-tools-for-repair-techs">manufacturers</a> of <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/89540/how-teenage-engineering-designed-a-barcelona-factory-to-build-its-new-k-o-ii-sampler">all</a> <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/60131/how-valve-is-changing-game-console-design">stripes</a> that <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/80311/repair-makes-cents">repair is good business</a>.</p>

<p>The tide is shifting in favor of more repairable gadgets and our other partnerships have been fruitful. We just launched repair parts with <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/collaborations/kobo">e-reader manufacturer Kobo</a> and have more announcements in the works. So far this year we’ve added over 10,000 new repair parts ranging from <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Parts/PC_Laptop/Batteries">laptop batteries</a> to <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Parts/Refrigerator">refrigerator ice makers</a>.</p>



<p>Independent repair businesses are the lifeblood of our economy, but <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/89674/how-monopolies-make-repair-harder">monopolization</a> has driven small repair businesses out of the market. Some companies hinder repair by blocking the distribution of essential parts and tools, requiring proprietary software to complete repairs, insisting on suffocating contracts, requiring expensive certifications, and pricing out the competition. This makes repairs cost more and take longer, and we won’t abide by unfriendly repair practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve been trying to counteract this trend by working to pass <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/right-to-repair-progress">repair-friendly legislation</a> and advocating for the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/88739/tell-the-ftc-we-need-right-to-repair-rules">Federal Trade Commission</a> and the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/49993/we-told-the-copyright-office-that-repair-should-be-legal-period">Copyright Office</a> to take common sense steps to protect everyone’s Right to Repair. When manufacturers reach out to us seeking to make their products last longer we are excited to help them unlock a galaxy of repair.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Samsung Didn’t Work Out</strong></p>

We still think true upcycling of old phones is a great idea—but we don’t trust Samsung to deliver.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Despite skepticism from the repair community, we tried to work with Samsung to create repair documentation for a few initial devices. However, flashy <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-galaxy-upcycling-programrepurpose-galaxy-smartphones-smart-home-devices/">press releases</a> and <a href="https://galaxyupcycling.github.io/">ambitious initiatives</a> don’t mean much without follow-through. We’ve <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/50450/samsung-galaxy-upcycling-unlocked-smartphone-smarthome-project">been through this</a> with Samsung before with Galaxy Upcycling, the amazing device reuse idea that we helped them announce. Then they ghosted us and never released it. We clearly didn’t learn our lesson the first time, and two years ago we let them convince us they were serious about embracing repair.</p>



<p>We tried to make this work. Gosh, we tried. But with such divergent priorities, we’re no longer able to proceed. So what does that mean for our community?&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Samsung phones are popular devices, we’ve tried to cover them with our in-house repair guides. But as the devices continued to decline in repairability, it made less and less sense. Having repair guides is a crucial part of repairability, but if Samsung is just profiting from unpaid work, do they really deserve that credit? We will be turning our limited guide-making bandwidth onto more deserving tech. Teardowns will proceed as normal—if the device is noteworthy enough (no pun intended), we’ll tear it down, and we still won’t pull punches on our <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/repairability">repairability scorecard</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That said, Samsung phones clearly need repair. No worries on that front: we will continue selling Samsung parts just as we have since 2015, well before our partnership. Although we won’t be making in-house Galaxy guides, we invite our community to keep sharing what you know about repairing Samsung devices. Anyone can make an iFixit guide—in fact, over half of our 100,000+ guides were not written by our in-house team. And for our repair shop customers, we’re no longer beholden to the miserly quantity limits you’ve been so frustrated by.</p>



<p>We’re bummed but we won’t apologize for our initial optimism. Nor will we let one bad apple spoil the bunch; instead, we’re tossing it out before it can do so. But we also won’t stop you from a chorus of “I told you so”s—honestly that’s fair. The warning signs were there—<a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/8464/batteries-explode-note7">we reported on them, after all</a>.</p>



<p>But that mix of criticism and optimism is what iFixit is here for. We’re pushing the envelope and pulling all the levers we can to make repair universal.</p>



<p><strong>What Now</strong></p>



<p>Looking ahead, we’re excited to continue our fight for a more repairable world and introduce new manufacturers and enhancements to the iFixit platform:</p>



<ul>
<li>Throughout the summer, iFixit will expand our Repair Hubs with existing partners to support more devices.&nbsp;</li>



<li>We’ll launch more parts in more countries for more devices.&nbsp;</li>



<li>We will release repairability scorecards for more device categories.</li>



<li>For repair service providers, iFixit will be partnering with third-party point-of-sale providers to make accessing repair content easier.</li>



<li>We’ve <strong>expanded our parts catalog</strong> with over 10,000 new parts to support an even broader range of devices. Our new offerings include parts for televisions, PC desktops and laptops, coffee makers, appliances, and video game consoles. This expansion is just the beginning.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Repair, not replacement should be the default. If fixing things was as easy as buying new ones, more people would do it.</p>



<p>We remain obsessively focused on creating a fantastic experience for our customers and enabling independent repair businesses to thrive. We’ll only maintain business relationships with manufacturers that share our vision. As Right to Repair laws take effect this summer, we will be helping more manufacturers roll out repair solutions for their products.</p>

    <em>matcha.css</em> is meticulously crafted to ensure compatibility with all modern browsers.
  </p>
  <form>
    <b>Methodology:</b>
    <ol>
      <li>Generate <em>matcha.css</em> stylesheet.</li>
      <li>
        Generate report table using <a href="https://jsr.io/@libs/bundle">jsr.io/@libs/bundle</a>, which performs the following tasks:
        <ol>
          <li>Retrieves the browsers list using <a href="https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist">browserslist.</a></li>
          <li>Parses the stylesheet using <a href="https://github.com/csstree/csstree">csstree.</a></li>
          <li>Checks the support of each CSS feature across browser versions using <a href="https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data">MDN browser compatibility data.</a></li>
          <li>Generates a summary <code><span>&lt;<span>table</span>&gt;</span></code> for easy reference.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <b>Notes:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Browser list adheres to <code>defaults</code> (<code>&gt; 0.5%, last 2 versions, Firefox ESR, not dead</code>).</li>
      <li>The first row displays the overall support for each browser.</li>
      <li>Please note that the auto-generated table may contain minor inaccuracies due to the complexity of mapping CSS features against compatibility data.</li>
      <li>Thus, browsers scoring 90% and above are considered fully supported.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can toggle verbosity to display additional information, such as specific CSS features and rules reported as partially supported or unsupported.
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Unsupported feature</li>
      <li>Partially supported feature</li>
      <li>Prefixed supported feature</li>

        <h3>Tales of the last Lorekeeper</h3>
      </header>
      <p>
        The paintings that cover the walls of this tower...
        These are the history of humanity and of nature itself.
        They're the tales that have been passed down by my ancestors for thousands of years.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Thousands of years ago, in the primal age long lost, the world was overflowing with natural energy.
        People could do nothing.
        The only choice was to watch as disaster upon disaster swept over them.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was in such a time that a great many meteoroids poured from the darkness of space, from a place higher even than the heavens.

    It's advisable to utilize the <code><span>&lt;<span>label</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;<span>input</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>label</span>&gt;</span></code> pattern so <em>matcha.css</em>
    can automatically detect whether the <code><span>&lt;<span>input</span>&gt;</span></code> is required or not (which is not possible
    when using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label#for"><code><span>&lt;<span>label</span> <span>for</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;<span>input</span>&gt;</span></code></a> pattern instead).

    The <code><span>@media</span> (default)</code> will hide <code><span>aside</span><span>:nth-of-type</span>(<span>1</span>)</code> on small screens, but it can be made visible again by adding a <code>data-expand</code> attribute.
    To make it collapsible, use a <code>data-expandable</code> attribute instead.
    The latter accepts a value to customize the text (e.g. <code>☰ Menu</code>).

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>There is nothing unusual about the outside of these disks, but there is something unique about the data that is stored on them, something that Sierra On-Line would have been totally unaware of and certainly wouldn’t have wanted them to include.</p>

<p><img src="https://lanceewing.github.io/images/Space_Quest_2.0D_Disk_1_small.jpg" width="100%"></p>

<p>If you happen to have one of these 720KB floppy disks lurking somewhere in your Sierra adventure game collection, then chances are you are not alone. Versions 2.0D and 2.0F of Space Quest II were not exactly uncommon.</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-directory-listing">A simple directory listing</h2>

<p>Listing the files on the disk doesn’t reveal anything unusual:</p>

<p><img src="https://lanceewing.github.io/images/sq2_directory_listing.png" width="100%"></p>

<p>The listing shown is from version 2.0D. There are no mysterious additional files, in fact it looks like any other Sierra game disk. Nothing is out of place.</p>

<p>The timestamps show that the game’s main data files, i.e. PICDIR, LOGDIR, VIEWDIR, SNDDIR, VOL.0 and VOL.1, were built on the 14th March 1988. The .OVL files are dated the 15th March 1988, and the AGI interpreter code itself is dated the 18th March 1988. These file timestamps capture a week of activity during which someone in the Sierra office was focused on preparing the 2.0D version of Space Quest II.</p>

<p>One thing that is a little curious about the directory listing above is that the “free” space on the disk is greater than the used space. 302,918 bytes are used and 402,432 bytes are supposedly free.</p>

<h2 id="using-a-hex-editor">Using a hex editor</h2>

<p>To take a closer look at what is on the disk, and to peek into that supposedly unused part, we need a tool called a hex editor. Back in the 1980s, a commonly used tool for this came with Norton Utilities. These days a great modern equivalent is the excellent HxD Hex Editor written by Maël Hörz.</p>

<p>For a freshly formatted DOS floppy disk, we’d expect all of the unused sectors to be filled with the 0xF6 byte value (i.e. DOS’s default format ‘filler’ byte), which is indeed the case for Disk 2 of Space Quest II version 2.0D, as shown below:</p>

<p><img src="https://lanceewing.github.io/images/Fully_Formatted_Sector.png" width="100%"></p>

<p>There isn’t, however, a single unused sector on Disk 1 that is filled with the 0xF6 byte, in fact the longest string of consecutive 0xF6 bytes on Disk 1 is only two. Given that over half the disk is “free” space, then clearly the disk had not been formatted prior to being prepared as a SQ2 master disk. The following shows an example of a section of the SQ2 Disk 1 disk that is marked as unused:</p>

<p><img src="https://lanceewing.github.io/images/Space_Quest_2_C_Code_Sector.png" width="100%"></p>

<p>Rather than being filled with the 0xF6 byte, it is instead filled with something that looks like C source code. This strongly suggests that the master disk was used for some other purpose prior to being the SQ2 Disk 1 master disk. The files were then deleted, but the disk was not properly formatted afterwards. Due to the way the DOS FAT file system works, deleting a file does not actually remove the data. Instead it simply marks the sectors as no longer being in use, so that in the future they could be used for a new file. If those sectors are never used again for a new file, then they will keep what they previously had stored on them, and so it was important that people fully formatted a floppy disk after storing sensitive files on them.</p>

<h2 id="agi-interpreter-source-code">AGI interpreter source code</h2>

<p>It is difficult to see exactly what the above data looks like when viewed in a hex editor, but it clearly looks like text, so let’s copy and paste the ASCII text on the right hand side into a text editor to see what we have:</p>

<p><img src="https://lanceewing.github.io/images/AGI_Interpreter_Source_Code.png" width="100%"></p>

<p>As we can see, it certainly does look like C source code. There are two functions defined, one called DisplayStatusLine and another called StatusLineOn. In the case of DisplayStatusLine, it appears to be displaying a line of text that includes the current score and whether the sound is on or off. Does this look familiar? You bet it does. Take a look at the top of the Space Quest II screen shot below:</p>

<p><img src="https://lanceewing.github.io/images/SQ2.png" width="100%"></p>

<p>That particular piece of C source code is responsible for displaying the white status bar at the top of the game screen, with the black text that shows the user what their current score is. This source code is a part of the AGI interpreter itself!</p>

<p>This is just one small example. Scrolling through more of the unused sectors in the hex editor reveals that there is a large amount of such source code. Not only that but the code is stored over consecutive sectors, i.e. it is not fragmented as you might expect, so it is relatively easy to extract this data from the disk and then split it up into separate C source files. The split points are easy to determine, since each file has a comment at the top saying what the name of the source file is. Splitting into the separate files gives us 93 files in total, made up of 75 C source files, 16 assembly language source files, and 2 DOS BAT files:</p>

<p><img src="https://lanceewing.github.io/images/List_of_AGI_Source_Files.png" width="100%"></p>

<p>In total, there are over 15000 lines of code and most of these files are complete.</p>

<p>It turns out that this Space Quest 2 game disk contains about 70% of the source code of Sierra On-Line’s AGI interpreter, complete with comments and change history. We will look at how that 70% figure was calculated later in the article.</p>

<p>When we say “the AGI interpreter”, what we are referring to is the file named “AGI” in the directory listing that was shown earlier, along with the the .OVL files. The “AGI” file is the executable that performs the actual interpretation of the game data contained in the LOGDIR, PICDIR, VIEWDIR, SNDDIR, OBJECT, WORDS.TOK and VOL files.</p>

<h2 id="source-file-change-history">Source file change history</h2>

<p>Some of the source files contain a change history within the header comment at the top. The following is an example from the ANIMATE.C source file:</p>

<p><img src="https://lanceewing.github.io/images/Source_File_Header_Comment.png" width="100%"></p>

<p>The header comment starts by stating the name of the source file. It then gives a short description of what it does, in this case to “Handle one cycle of animation in an adventure game”. Next we have a line that says “compile: MWC”. This appears to state the name of the C compiler that was used to compile the C source. MWC was a C compiler from the Mark Williams company that was very popular in those days. After that, the header has a “Change History” section and this makes for very interesting reading. It mentions the date, time, initials of the person making the change, and a description of the change.</p>

<p>The programmers have identied themselves using their initials, including their middle name initial. JAS is none other than Jeff Stephenson, the main programmer who was working on the AGI interpreter code, and DCI is Chris Iden. If you look at the game credits for the AGI games from 1985-89, you will see that Jeff and Chris were always credited with working on the game development system.</p>

<p><img src="https://lanceewing.github.io/images/Space_Quest_2_Credits.png" width="100%"></p>

<p>Robert Heitman is also listed, but his focus was mainly on the graphics tools (i.e. the Picture Editor (PE) and View Editor (VE)), whereas Jeff and Chris worked primarily on the interpreter code. So it isn’t surprising to see their initials in the change history for the C source code of the AGI interpreter.</p>

<h2 id="agiexe-memory-map">AGI.EXE memory map</h2>

<p>In addition to the 93 AGI interpreter source code files, the SQ2 2.0D 720KB Disk 1 disk also contains over 2000 lines of a Memory Map of the AGI.EXE executable. For production releases of AGI games, the interpreter executable is called simply AGI, and is not directly executable, but during the development of the games, Sierra On-Line used a version of the interpreter that had the .EXE extension and could be run directly. Someone at Sierra generated a memory map of the AGI.EXE executable, i.e. the AGI interpreter, on the 7th October 1987. A small section of it is shown below:</p>

<p><img src="https://lanceewing.github.io/images/AGI_Memory_Map.png" width="100%"></p>

<p>This gives a potential date to the collection of source code files. It ties in with the most recent change history comment in the code, which is from September 1987.</p>

<p>The memory map also gives us a fairly complete list of the modules and source files that make up the AGI interpreter. Each module specifies the file that it is defined in. If we count the number of distinct source files mentioned, it comes to 98. The number of those source files that are present in full on the SQ2 disk is 71. This is where we get the figure of roughly 70% for the amount of AGI interpreter source code that is on the SQ2 disk. For some of the modules, only the C header file is included, and so those modules are not included in this calculation.</p>

<h2 id="sierras-intellectual-property">Sierra’s intellectual property</h2>

<p>In 1984, Sierra On-Line was lucky to survive as a business. Some time around the release of King’s Quest, in May/June of that year, Ken Williams had to lay off around 100 of his employees, reducing the head count from approximately 130 down to about 30. Although it was a struggle, part of what turned their fortunes around was the success of the AGI adventure game system and the games that were built using it. By the end of 1984, King’s Quest had entered the top 20 on the software sales charts for computer games. It would stay there for the next half year, right up until the release of King’s Quest II, and it wasn’t long until King’s Quest II was also in the charts. This was helped a lot by the deal that Sierra made with Tandy Radio Shack to sell Tandy versions of the games in the Radio Shack stores.</p>

<p>The AGI games continued to be best sellers from 1985 to 1988. Over those years, the AGI interpreter was Sierra On-Line’s primary means of making money and therefore a core part of their intellectual property. They not only invented the 3D animated graphic adventure game genre but also had a head start on their competitors that lasted several years. It is safe to say that the source code for the AGI interpreter is something that Sierra would have preferred didn’t fall into the hands of their competitors.</p>

<p>For 70% of the source code to end up being copied en masse and sent out to tens, if not hundreds of thousands of their customers, was a big blunder.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-this-happen">How did this happen?</h2>

<p>When a new release version of a game was prepared by Sierra, it involved creating a “production copy” master disk to be used by the FormMaster disk duplication machine. This machine did not simply copy files from the the master disk to each copy but instead copied every byte of every sector of the disk, regardless of whether the sectors were currently being used or not. What this meant in the case of the version 2.0D and 2.0F SQ2 Disk 1 disks is that it also copied the supposedly unused 402,432 bytes, despite there being no reason to. This is why the preparation of a master disk involved ensuring that it started out fully formatted before the game was copied on to it, and for the most part, Sierra On-Line got this step right. Most original Sierra game disks were formatted before use. It would seem that someone forgot to do this for the Space Quest II version 2.0D Disk 1 disk, and the same disk was then also used for version 2.0F of SQ2.</p>

<p>This meant that potentially hundreds of thousands of SQ2 disks sent to customers and retail stores had a copy of 70% of the AGI interpreter source code hidden on them.</p>

<h2 id="dodged-a-bullet">Dodged a bullet</h2>

<p>It was almost certainly an unintentional mistake. Surprisingly, no one appeared to have noticed that this happened, not Sierra, not their competitors or their customers, and it was only discovered decades later, the first known discovery of it by online user NewRisingSun in October 2016.</p>

<p>It is also fortuitous that this happened at the end of the AGI era. In March 1988, Sierra had already developed their SCI adventure game system and were about to release the first game using it, which would be King’s Quest IV. So “losing” the AGI interpreter source code into the public domain, should someone have noticed it, may not have been the issue it could have been only a year or two before that.</p>

<p>It makes for an interesting digital archeaology story though, and it allows us, 36 years later, to see how our heros at Sierra On-Line wrote their AGI interpreter.</p>

		<p>Southwest Airlines famously doesn’t show up when searching online travel agency websites. Historically if you’ve wanted to buy a ticket on Southwest, you’ve had to go directly to Southwest to make the purchase.
</p><p>That saves money on distribution costs since they aren’t paying third parties<br>
But it means many consumers aren’t considering Southwest since they don’t even know about the option<br>
The Southwest Airlines website became one of the first five e-commerce sites to hit a billion dollars in revenue, nearly a quarter century ago.</p>
<p>If you go to Expedia to find out about flights, you assume you’re finding out about all of the flights on a route.  Yet Southwest even <a href="https://viewfromthewing.com/southwest-airlines-wins-court-ruling-to-stop-website-from-publishing-its-schedules-and-fares/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sues websites that display its schedules and fares</a> without authorization.  </p>
<p>Now, however, <u>Southwest Airlines flights appear</u> in results at <a href="http://www.google.com/flights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Flights</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://viewfromthewing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-22-112403.png"></p>	<!-- /1019006/BoardingArea_DynamicContent -->
	
	
<p>When a Chrome browser extension let you see Southwest itineraries on Google flights a year and a half ago, <a href="https://viewfromthewing.com/how-to-see-southwest-airlines-flights-in-your-search-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the airline killed it</a>.</p>
<p>Two things have changed since then.</p>
<ol><li><b>Southwest is struggling.</b>  <a href="https://viewfromthewing.com/big-changes-coming-to-southwest-airlines-expect-extra-legroom-seats-and-some-assigned-seating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">They are working on a number of changes to their business model</a> to better meet customers where they are and deliver a product that customers are demanding.  They need revenue anywhere they can get it as their losses have been surprising.  
</li><li><b>Airfare displays will have to include some fees</b> like checked bag fees under new Department of Transportation rules.  Southwest doesn’t sell basic economy fares, and hasn’t had change fees.  Other airlines largely matched the lack of change fees on non-basic economy tickets during the pandemic.  Southwest also includes two checked bags with each ticket.  <i>Competitor fares will have to show the cost of checked bag fees</i>.  Previously, displays disadvantaged Southwest but new government rules will make them look cheaper to many customers.</li></ol>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://viewfromthewing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/new-southwest-cabin.jpg"></p>
<p>Southwest Airlines didn’t like price comparisons with other carriers on third party websites because they were often more expensive, especially given their more bundled model – in addition to the added distribution costs selling through other systems.</p>
<p>New government rules will make those same Southwest tickets appear more competitive, and Southwest is willing to allow their fares to be displayed next to those of other airlines.  And with the airline struggling they’re willing to revisit past orthodoxies.</p>

            <pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 14:31:36 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://depot.dev/blog/faster-ec2-boot-time">https://depot.dev/blog/faster-ec2-boot-time</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40455208">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It is possible to increase the speed at which EC2 instances boot! This can be critical for certain types of workloads, where a fresh EC2 instance is needed to process some request or task. At Depot, we accelerate builds, so the
EC2 boot time directly equals the lag time for a build to start processing.</p>
<p>It can seem like EC2's boot time is fixed, that the time taken to start an instance depends solely on Amazon. However, this turns out not to be the case, there are several ways to speed up the process, especially if you know the workload that will execute on the machine after boot, like a Docker image build or GitHub Actions runner.</p>
<p>We managed to <strong>reduce EC2 boot time from 40 seconds to 5 seconds</strong> by optimizing each step in the instance launch process.</p>
<h2 id="what-takes-so-long">What takes so long?</h2>
<p>When a new EC2 instance is requested with <code>RunInstances</code>, AWS performs several different operations to prepare and boot that instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating the root EBS volume from the chosen AMI</li>
<li>Assigning the instance a private IP address</li>
<li>Choosing a target host for the instance</li>
<li>Actually booting the machine</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the instance hardware is powered on, there's also a bootloader, kernel, and userspace processes that need to start. Each of those steps happens with each instance that you launch and before your application or service starts on it.</p>
<h2 id="avoiding-the-problem">Avoiding the problem</h2>
<p>In the past, we've optimized the time to start a build by <a href="https://depot.dev/blog/infrastructure-provisioner-v3">running a pool of standby compute</a>, where incoming build requests are routed to already-running EC2 instances if available. This works well for container builds, where many incoming builds for the same project are routed to the same pool of machines.</p>
<p>While this hides the EC2 start lag from users, it's not economically viable for all workloads. For <a href="https://depot.dev/blog/depot-github-actions-runners">managed GitHub Actions runners</a>, each job in a workflow is routed to a dedicated EC2 instance. And with matrix workflows, it's possible to launch many jobs in parallel. It's not possible to keep 50 EC2 instances online just to handle one customer's incoming 50-job matrix workflow.</p>
<p>But, launching 50 concurrent EC2 instances with a 40-second boot time is also not acceptable either. So, we had to look at ways to reduce the time it takes to boot an EC2 instance.</p>
<h2 id="faster-boot-times">Faster boot times</h2>
<p>One thread became common, <strong>not doing something is always faster than doing something</strong>, if that's an option for the specific workload.</p>
<p>We used this theme by systematically optimizing each step of the EC2 instance creation, boot, and application start, to reduce the time to running application from nearly 40 seconds to 5 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> — boot the instance once, shut the instance down, then boot it again when needed.</p>
<h3 id="ebs-root-volume-streaming">EBS root volume streaming</h3>
<p>Preparing the EBS root volume for use is one of the longest and most impactful aspects of EC2 instance boot time and subsequent application performance once the instance has started. When an EBS volume is created from an AMI, the following happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>The EBS volume is created, pointing at the AMI snapshot</li>
<li>When empty blocks are accessed, they receive the full performance of the volume type</li>
<li>However when data blocks are accessed for the first time, they must be pulled from S3 and written to the volume before they are returned to the instance</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that the creating of the EBS root volume is "fast", because it does not need to actually copy the contents of the AMI into the volume. But it also means that every file operation that accesses a data block for the first time will experience a large performance reduction as that data is lazily loaded from S3 in the background.</p>
<p>This can especially affect kernel and application start time. Without optimizations, our GitHub Actions runner AMI's first boot can take 5 seconds for the kernel + 5 seconds just for systemd to <em>load unit files</em>, before any processes actually start. Then on restart, since the files are already loaded from S3, that whole process takes <em>less than 400 ms!</em></p>
<h4 id="awss-recommended-solution">AWS's recommended solution</h4>
<p>AWS <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ebs/latest/userguide/ebs-initialize.html">documents this behavior</a> and mentions a possible solution: it's possible to preload all data blocks by forcing each of them to be read once. They recommend using <a href="https://fio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fio_doc.html"><code>fio</code></a> to access each block in parallel:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="shell" data-theme="Depot"><code data-language="shell" data-theme="Depot"><span data-line=""><span>#!/bin/bash</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>volume</span><span>=</span><span>/dev/xvdf</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>sudo</span><span> fio</span><span> --filename=</span><span>$volume</span><span> --rw=read</span><span> --bs=1M</span><span> --iodepth=32</span><span> \</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  --ioengine=libaio</span><span> --direct=1</span><span> --name=volume-initialize</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>This will cause each data block to be accessed and fully streamed from S3 onto the EBS volume. There are however two potential issues with this approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It's slow to access every block - for a 100 GB gp3 volume, which has a default throughput of 125 MB/s, running the <code>fio</code> above would take <em>over 13 minutes</em>! (800 seconds)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's not possible to launch a new EC2 instance with an existing EBS volume. Instead a new EBS volume is always created with the instance is launched.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>However, we can combine this solution with the next approach: booting the instance once before it's actually needed.</p>
<h3 id="start-the-instance-once">Start the instance once</h3>
<p>While it's not possible to launch a new EC2 instance with an existing EBS volume, it is possible to stop an EBS-backed instance and then start it again.</p>
<p>From a billing perspective, AWS does not charge for the EC2 instance itself when stopped, as there's no physical hardware being reserved; a stopped instance is just the configuration that will be used when the instance is started next. Note that you do pay for the root EBS volume though, as it's still consuming storage.</p>
<p>Therefore, it's possible to boot an EC2 instance once, let it perform whatever initialization it needs, then stop the EC2 instance, and this creates a "warmed" EBS root volume!</p>
<p>Besides warming the EBS volume, this also caches two other steps of the boot process:</p>
<ol>
<li>The configuration for the instance (tags, launch options, user data, security groups, etc)</li>
<li>The private IP address assigned to the instance</li>
</ol>
<p>This means that when the instance is started again, not only will it start with a pre-warmed EBS root volume, but also with a pre-cached instance and network configuration.</p>
<p><strong>Booting the EC2 instance is equivalent to an optimized version of <code>fio</code> pre-warming!</strong> The first time the instance starts, it will access just the data blocks that are relevant to booting the instance. Then for the next boot, those data blocks will already be loaded on the volume!</p>
<p>This makes warming very fast, rather than spending 11 minutes to read <em>every</em> data block, it takes less than 30 seconds to perform the initial boot / warming.</p>
<h4 id="autoscaling-warm-pools">Autoscaling warm pools</h4>
<p>AWS offers something very similar to this approach called <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ec2-auto-scaling-warm-pools.html">warm pools for EC2 Auto Scaling</a>. This allows you to define a certain number of EC2 instances inside an autoscaling group that are booted once, perform initialization, then shut down, and the autoscaling group will pull from this pool of compute first when scaling up.</p>
<p>While this sounds like it would serve our needs, autoscaling groups are <em>very slow</em> to react to incoming requests to scale up. From experimentation, it appears that autoscaling groups may have a slow poll loop that checks if new instances are needed, so the delay between requesting a scale up and the instance starting can exceed 60 seconds. For us, this negates the benefit of the warm pool.</p>
<p>Since we need the best launch performance, we launch EC2 instances directly with the <code>LaunchInstances</code> and <code>StartInstances</code> API calls instead.</p>
<h3 id="resizing-the-instance">Resizing the instance</h3>
<p>The final boot time optimization involves changing the instance type of a warmed and stopped instance. Since a stopped EC2 instance is "just" an EBS volume + the instance configuration that will be used whenever the instance is started again, it's possible to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-resize.html">change that instance's type</a> with <code>UpdateInstance</code> before starting it again.</p>
<p>This is important for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You can use cheaper instance types to perform the warming and avoid consuming AWS capacity for the warming process - we use <code>t3.large</code> instance types when first launching the instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When AWS has capacity issues and a particular instance type is unavailable, it's possible to update the instance type to another one with availability and still use the pre-warmed EBS root volume.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It's also possible to update the provisioned IOPS and throughput for certain EBS volume types, including gp3, if different performance profiles are needed during the warming or running phases.</p>
<h2 id="the-whole-flow">The whole flow</h2>
<p>For us, that means that our GitHub Actions runner instances go through the following flow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Created as a <code>t3.large</code> instance with a root EBS volume</li>
<li>Assigned a private IP address in the target VPC</li>
<li>The kernel and userspace processes start once, causing the relevant data blocks to stream from S3 onto the EBS volume</li>
<li>The instance is stopped</li>
<li>When a GitHub job request arrives, the instance type is updated to a <code>m7a</code> instance type, depending on how many CPUs were requested, and the instance is started</li>
<li>If AWS responds that there is no current capacity for <code>m7a</code> instances, the instance is updated to a backup type (like <code>m7i</code>) and started again</li>
</ol>
<p>That flow reduces the time the instance for a job <strong>from over 40 seconds to under 5 seconds!</strong></p>
<h2 id="followup-work">Followup work</h2>
<p>Besides the above, it's possible to further reduce the time from instance start to application running by optimizing what software actually needs to start — for instance, we removed cloud-init from our GitHub Actions AMI as it was unused and contributed heavily to both boot and reboot time. This depends on the specific application and workload though.</p>
<p>Probably the subject of another post, but we also need to handle specific quirks of the GitHub Actions agent API - while we can boot the Actions runner within 5 seconds of a job starting, it can take GitHub 10+ seconds to actually deliver that job to the runner. We've optimized this process already, but there may be further tricks here.</p>

                  <p>As someone who has obligations to provide for a family in the USA, I can't imagine leaving dev work without an absolute clear passion and burning drive to do something specific. Giving up a six figure income I use to feed and house my family that demands I use my brain while sitting in a comfortable indoor environment, doing nothing more physically taxing than use a keyboard? Sure, I have fantasies from time to time about doing something with more dynamism in meatspace, but let's get real: it's a fantasy. I can't imagine recommending anyone with a stable career in data work upset that apple cart unless they already have a clear aim in mind, which they think about day and night - not with the unsureness of this post.</p>

                  <p>I'm glad you love your career! I found myself getting increasingly unfit, sad, daylight-deprived and in need of doing something - anything! - else that involved me moving my body. (Bandaids like a standing desk or regular breaks or gym work or a SAD lamp couldn't really detract from the fact I was spending 8 hours a day (the brightest daylight hours too!), in the prime of my life, cooped up at a desk. After a career in live sound, I now design and install high-end A/V hardware and I love it.</p>

When your life is unsatisfying for reasons that are your fault (or just very hard to fix) and hard to grapple with (e.g., your romantic life is awful, you hate your physical apperance, you antagonized your family, you're an addict, etc.), your working hours can feel intensely oppressive with that other stuff weighing on you and the newness of scenery and focus can appear like an attractive chance to escape.

                  <p>I got burnt out as a SWE at a startup from stress and health issues. Bought a cafe and turned it into a bookstore cafe. Annual revenue is around 600k. Seller's discretionary earnings is around 220k. In hindsight, I should have done this earlier. Not having to deal with office politics, insane on-call rotations, stress. On top of that, it helped me qualify for E-2 investor visa, which is far less of a headache than OPT/H-1B. It was a major help having an experienced business broker/commercial real estate agent.</p>

Now days, that still exists, but the action is also on Discord, Instagram, and Tiktok.</p><p>Once I had a little bit of a following, Casey Reas reached out about doing a group exhibition with Feral File that he was curating. That was a big moment. The release was very successful, and I saw that this path could be viable. It took me another year to fully commit to full time art though.</p><p>I think just immersing yourself and starting from the ground up is really important.

This attracted the attention of a new friend who was inspired by my work to put a startup together, seeing real estate mass appraisal as the most important missing piece for policy reasons, but also a potentially great business idea.</p><p>Investors agreed with him and a startup was formed. This gave me an alternative to game dev when I needed it most.</p><p>As for the actual work transition, I had a lot of subject matter to learn which we facilitated by hiring experts from the field, including former IAAO researchers (that’s the relevant standards body) as well as local appraisers.</p><p>I’m still learning but a lot of my skills transferred. The biggest difference is this is typically a pretty low tech field so many essential skills are soft — all the tech in the world doesn’t matter if you can’t explain things in simple terms to a citizen. As I like to say “Prepare for a property tax protest defense, not a PhD thesis defense.”</p><p>The other big difference is cost structure and expectations and competition. Game development is essentially selling one of the hardest kinds of programs to write, to the world’s best served audience, under maximum competition, for the lowest prices.</p><p>In local government you can charge what felt to me like large prices and still be genuinely considered cheap compared to what existing vendors charge. And people are used to software that doesn’t work and customer support that never responds. So if you can exceed expectations that is an edge here.</p><p>But many tech people have failed in this field, because they can’t master the soft skills and they can’t communicate simply; that part is deceptively hard.</p></div></td></tr>

Someone who can learn about, and educate others about, building proper observers and reporters into C++ codebases, and building proper dashboards with data coming out is <i>always really valuable</i>. From there it's a short hop into roboticsy systemsy things itself. But beware, large shops will have these silo'd. Think smallish labs for large companies. You do <i>not</i> want to get stuck building reports for product teams - stick to engineering teams.</p><p>2. Manufacturing, at the highest levels, is metrics driven, so again, getting in and helping to establish data-driven process refinements, then moving "down" the stack into the software is a good way to make your pivot into embedded systems or industrial IoT.  But beware, large shops will have these very much silo'd.</p><p>3. Science / academia. A good analyst for a research lab is impossible to find, because of pay differentials. But if you can take the hit, and are willing to grovel a little, you can easily become the most valuable person in a large enough academic lab.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>   
<span>Thursday, 23 May 2024</span>


<p>The <a href="https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2023/11/Euclid_s_view_of_the_Perseus_cluster_of_galaxies">first scientific pictures</a> from the Euclid satellite mission have revealed more than 1,500 billion orphan stars scattered throughout the Perseus cluster of galaxies.</p>

<p>Led by astronomers from the University of Nottingham, this discovery sheds light on the origins of these celestial wanderers.</p>
<p>The Perseus cluster, located 240 million light-years away from Earth, is one of the Universe's most massive structures, boasting thousands of galaxies. However, amidst this cosmic ensemble, the Euclid satellite captured faint ghostly light - the orphan stars - drifting between the cluster's galaxies.</p>
<p>Stars naturally form within galaxies, so the presence of orphan stars outside these structures raised intriguing questions about their origins.</p>            <div>
                    <blockquote>
                        We were surprised by our ability to see so far into the outer regions of the cluster and discern the subtle colours of this light. This light can help us map dark matter if we understand where the intracluster stars came from. By studying their colours, luminosity, and configurations, we found they originated from small galaxies.
                        
                    </blockquote>
                </div>
<p>The orphan stars are characterised by their bluish hue and clustered arrangement. Based on these distinctive features the astronomers involved in the study suggest that the stars were torn from the outskirts of galaxies and from the complete disruption of smaller cluster galaxies, known as dwarfs.</p>
<p>After being torn from their parent galaxies, the orphaned stars were expected to orbit around the largest galaxy within the cluster. However, this study revealed a surprising finding: the orphan stars instead circled a point between the two most luminous galaxies in the cluster.</p>            <figure>

Cuillandre (CEA Paris-Saclay)

<p>Dr Jesse Golden-Marx, a Nottingham astronomer involved in the study, commented, "This novel observation suggests that the massive Perseus cluster may have recently undergone a merger with another group of galaxies. This recent merger could have induced a gravitational disturbance, causing either the most massive galaxy or the orphan stars to deviate from their expected orbits, thus resulting in the observed misalignment."</p>
<p>Dr Matthias Kluge, from the Max-Planck institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Munich, Germany, stated: "This diffuse light is more than 100,000 times fainter than the darkest night sky on Earth. But it is spread over such a large volume that when we add it all up, it accounts for about 20% of the luminosity of the entire cluster."</p>
<p>ESA's Euclid mission is designed to explore the composition and evolution of the dark Universe. The space telescope will create a great map of the large-scale structure of the Universe across space and time by observing billions of galaxies out to 10 billion light-years, across more than a third of the sky. Euclid will explore how the Universe has expanded and how structure has formed over cosmic history, revealing more about the role of gravity and the nature of dark energy and dark matter.</p>
<p>Dr Mireia Montes, an astronomer from the Institute of Astrophysics on the Canary Islands involved in the study said, “This work was only possible thanks to Euclid’s sensitivity and sharpness”. Euclid’s revolutionary design means that it can take images with similar sharpness as the Hubble Space Telescope, but covering an area that is 175 times larger.</p>

In 1937 the U.S. produced around 3,100 aircraft, most of which were small private planes. Prior to the war the value of aircraft made in the U.S. was about one-fourth the value of cans produced, and just 3.5% of the value of cars produced. Despite the continuing escalation of the war in Europe, the U.S. was reluctant to prepare for large-scale mobilization. Existing mobilization plans assumed that any future war would be smaller in scale than World War I had been, and that only half of the already-small existing aircraft manufacturing capacity would be devoted to war production. As late as 1940 the U.S. military had just 2,665 aircraft, around a tenth of what Germany’s Luftwaffe fielded. And the aircraft the U.S. did have were out of date: Though the airplane was invented in the U.S. in 1903, by the late 1930s the most advanced aircraft were being produced in other countries, and there was little urgency to close this gap. Military orders for Boeing’s advanced B-17, of which more than 12,000 would ultimately be built, were canceled in 1937 after a crash during testing in favor of the cheaper and less capable B-18, nearly driving Boeing into bankruptcy.</p><p>Producing the aircraft needed to win the war required a complete transformation of the aircraft industry. Between 1939 and 1944, the value of aircraft produced annually in the U.S. increased by a factor of 70, and the total weight of aircraft produced (a common measure of aircraft industry output) increased by a factor of 64. In 1940, the airframe industry employed just 59,000 people; three years later that reached 939,000, with another 339,000 building aircraft engines. Factories of unprecedented size, enclosing millions of square feet were built; by the end of the war aircraft engine factory floor space had increased from 1.7 million square feet to 75 million, and a single large engine factory encompassed more space than had been used by the entire pre-war engine industry.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06ba333e-9f33-407c-9890-aa8139b3e051_620x341.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06ba333e-9f33-407c-9890-aa8139b3e051_620x341.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06ba333e-9f33-407c-9890-aa8139b3e051_620x341.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06ba333e-9f33-407c-9890-aa8139b3e051_620x341.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06ba333e-9f33-407c-9890-aa8139b3e051_620x341.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06ba333e-9f33-407c-9890-aa8139b3e051_620x341.png" width="620" height="341" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/06ba333e-9f33-407c-9890-aa8139b3e051_620x341.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:341,&quot;width&quot;:620,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06ba333e-9f33-407c-9890-aa8139b3e051_620x341.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06ba333e-9f33-407c-9890-aa8139b3e051_620x341.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06ba333e-9f33-407c-9890-aa8139b3e051_620x341.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06ba333e-9f33-407c-9890-aa8139b3e051_620x341.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Not only did the aircraft industry grow in size, but it also adopted entirely novel methods of production, modifying mass-production methods used in cars and other products for the needs of aircraft manufacturing. And while it seems rapid in hindsight, in fact the process took years. In part because the U.S. government and the aircraft industry were unprepared for the requirements of large-volume production, and in part because developing new aircraft and scaling up manufacturing were difficult and time-consuming activities that could only be accelerated so much, even in an emergency. Had conditions been slightly different — if Britain and France hadn’t kickstarted the industry with enormous aircraft orders, or if people like GM President Bill Knudsen hadn’t pushed for early industrial mobilization — the outcome might have been very different.</p><p><span>The first push to grow the U.S. aircraft industry came well before the U.S. entered the war. Desperate for more planes to counter Hitler’s territorial ambitions, both Britain and France placed large orders with U.S. aircraft manufacturers in 1938 and 1939. In 1938 Britain placed an order for up to 250 of Lockheed’s </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Hudson" rel="">Hudson</a><span> bombers, worth $25 million.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-144851894" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-to-build-300000-airplanes-in#footnote-2-144851894" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> The order, then the largest order ever received by a U.S. aircraft manufacturer, was several times Lockheed’s annual revenues of $2-3 million, and Lockheed quickly doubled its workforce to fulfill it. Engine manufacturer Pratt &amp; Whitney was rescued from the brink of bankruptcy by a French order for engines worth $2 million in 1938, followed by an even larger order worth $85 million in 1939. North American Aviation grew from 150 employees in 1935 to 3,400 employees in 1939, partly due to British orders for its AT-6 “Texan” training aircraft.</span></p><p>By 1940 Britain and France had together ordered more than 6,000 planes from U.S. manufacturers for roughly $573 million ($12.8B in 2024 dollars), or around seven times what the U.S. aircraft industry produced in 1936 by dollar value. This allowed U.S. aircraft manufacturers to greatly expand their workforces, and industry employment tripled between 1938 and 1940. The orders also enabled manufacturers to build new, larger factories. French upfront payments allowed Pratt &amp; Whitney to build a new facility at its Connecticut factory (dubbed “the French Wing”) which doubled its floor space, and a similar French investment allowed Wright to triple its factory space. Altogether, by 1940 the British and French had invested $72 million ($1.6B in 2024 dollars) in U.S. aircraft factories, estimated to have sped up the process of scaling up aircraft production by a year.</p><p><span>The next great push for aircraft production came in 1940, after Germany invaded western Europe. On April 9th Germany invaded Norway and Denmark, and on May 10th Germany </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_France" rel="">invaded </a><span>Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and France. On May 16th Roosevelt asked Congress for $1.2 billion in additional defense funding ($26.8B in 2024 dollars) and called for the U.S. to build 50,000 aircraft a year, roughly as many aircraft as the U.S. industry had produced in the entire history of aviation to that point. This was 25 times what had been built in 1939, and more than eight times existing aircraft expansion plans. By July Congress had authorized funds to build 24,000 aircraft, and over the next year Congress appropriated $12 billion in total defense spending, roughly 10 times what the U.S. had spent annually in the 1930s. By 1941, while not planning on building 50,000 aircraft a year (a number Roosevelt had seemingly selected out of thin air), plans were in motion to expand U.S. air forces to more than 63,000 aircraft by 1944, as well as to continue supplying Allied nations with aircraft. A 1934 law, which prevented the U.S. from extending credit to countries that had defaulted on their WWI debt, threatened to derail further foreign sales. But in 1941 the U.S. passed the Lend-Lease Act, which authorized $7 billion ($149 billion in 2024 dollars) to supply Allied nations with supplies and military equipment, including aircraft.</span></p><p>After Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and the U.S. formally entered the war, Roosevelt raised aircraft production targets again, to 60,000 aircraft in 1942 and 125,000 aircraft in 1943. Though many doubted these production levels could be achieved, (and indeed, they weren’t), they nevertheless became the targets the U.S. aimed to hit.</p><p>Initially it was hoped that aircraft manufacturers would be able to build the factories needed themselves, and several measures were taken to try to reduce the burdens of plant construction. The Vinson-Trammell Act limited profits on government contracts to just 12% (later reduced to 8%), and required an extensive audit of the contract to ensure the profits were correct prior to production beginning. This Act was suspended, and nearly every aircraft contract during the war was structured as cost plus fixed fee (ultimately resulting in low, single-digit profits for the aircraft manufacturers). And the allowable tax amortization period for new factories was reduced from 20 years to 5 years to reduce the financial burden of new, large factories that might only be needed briefly. While these measures were being debated in Congress, aircraft procurement slowed to a standstill: 100 days after Roosevelt’s demand for 50,000 airplanes and congressional funding of $400 million worth of aircraft, just 343 aircraft had been ordered.</p><p>It was soon realized that the scale of expansion required was far too much for the existing industry to finance (in part because banks were reluctant to provide loans), and ultimately most new aircraft factories were built by the government as GOCO (government-owned, contractor-operated) facilities. While some factories were built by the War and Navy Departments directly, much of the expansion was financed by the Defense Plant Corporation (DPC), the brainchild of Bill Knudsen, who had left his job as president of General Motors at the request of President Roosevelt to work for free helping U.S. industrial mobilization. North American Aviation, for instance, used DPC financing to construct a new factory in Dallas, and DPC leased the company machine tools to expand its Los Angeles factory. Thanks in part to DPC financing, by the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, North American had expanded from 3,400 to 23,000 employees, and had enlarged its factory space by a factor of six.</p><p><span>The DPC was a subsidiary of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, a government-owned corporation formed during the Great Depression to provide emergency lending for businesses, and in the years since had become the government’s “</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Destructive-Creation-American-Business-Politics/dp/0812248333" rel="">biggest bailout machine, infrastructure bank, and multipurpose source of credit and finance.”</a><span> As a result of government funding the industry’s expansion, by the end of the war the federal government owned roughly 90% of the aircraft manufacturing capacity in the U.S.</span></p><p>Many of the new plants were built in the Midwest, both because it would be easier to find workers and to keep the factories out of reach of enemy attack. To build the plants quickly and minimize the use of critical materials, novel construction methods were often used. A factory for Chrysler was redesigned to use reinforced concrete instead of steel, and constructed using movable rolling forms known as “Trojan Horses,” where concrete would be poured, set, and then the forms rolled into the next position. Some factories were built in as little as 30 days.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b6f8112-f971-4525-a410-6c00272b58bf_450x435.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b6f8112-f971-4525-a410-6c00272b58bf_450x435.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b6f8112-f971-4525-a410-6c00272b58bf_450x435.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b6f8112-f971-4525-a410-6c00272b58bf_450x435.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b6f8112-f971-4525-a410-6c00272b58bf_450x435.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b6f8112-f971-4525-a410-6c00272b58bf_450x435.png" width="450" height="435" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2b6f8112-f971-4525-a410-6c00272b58bf_450x435.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:435,&quot;width&quot;:450,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b6f8112-f971-4525-a410-6c00272b58bf_450x435.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b6f8112-f971-4525-a410-6c00272b58bf_450x435.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b6f8112-f971-4525-a410-6c00272b58bf_450x435.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b6f8112-f971-4525-a410-6c00272b58bf_450x435.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Dodge Chicago aircraft engine plant, the largest factory in the world when it was constructed, superimposed over lower Manhattan.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Many of these factories were designed by Albert Kahn, the famous industrial architect responsible for the design of Ford’s enormous Rouge Facility. Over the course of the war Kahn’s firm designed nearly 100 million square feet of factory space. Kahn favored large, single-story factory buildings with wide bays to maximize the flow of material through the factories and minimize interruptions. To accommodate the thousands of factory workers while still allowing material to flow smoothly, many of Kahn’s factories were designed to have locker rooms, cafeterias, and other worker services in the basement of the factory below the production floor. Workers would enter the factory from below and then climb stairs to their work area, minimizing the need to cross the production floor and interrupt material travel paths.</p><p>Roosevelt’s production targets were far greater than what the existing aircraft industry could handle, even after they greatly expanded their workforces, and manufacturers in a variety of different industries ultimately contributed to wartime aircraft manufacturing. Final assembly of aircraft themselves mostly remained the purview of existing aircraft manufacturers scaling up their operations, though several different manufacturers produced the same aircraft (Boeing’s B-17, for instance, was also made by Douglas and Lockheed). Ford was the only non-aircraft manufacturer that delivered fully assembled aircraft in any appreciable quantity, building roughly 6,800 aircraft during the war.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27790d95-8a47-40d2-8403-07a2951aaeb5_339x300.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27790d95-8a47-40d2-8403-07a2951aaeb5_339x300.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27790d95-8a47-40d2-8403-07a2951aaeb5_339x300.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27790d95-8a47-40d2-8403-07a2951aaeb5_339x300.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27790d95-8a47-40d2-8403-07a2951aaeb5_339x300.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27790d95-8a47-40d2-8403-07a2951aaeb5_339x300.png" width="339" height="300" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/27790d95-8a47-40d2-8403-07a2951aaeb5_339x300.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:300,&quot;width&quot;:339,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27790d95-8a47-40d2-8403-07a2951aaeb5_339x300.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27790d95-8a47-40d2-8403-07a2951aaeb5_339x300.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27790d95-8a47-40d2-8403-07a2951aaeb5_339x300.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F27790d95-8a47-40d2-8403-07a2951aaeb5_339x300.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Wartime output of aircraft by company, via “Buying Aircraft”</figcaption></figure></div><p>But for aircraft parts and subassemblies, manufacturers outside the aircraft industry were used heavily as subcontractors and licensees. Car manufacturers like Studebaker built aircraft engines, and appliance manufacturers Nash-Kelvinator and Frigidaire built airplane propellers. Chrysler built a variety of aircraft components including engines, nose sections, and wing edges for the B-29 and cockpit enclosures for the B-17. Roughly half of the weight of aircraft produced during the war was produced by subcontractors and licensees, compared to about 10% in 1940. The car industry alone produced about 56% of the more than 800,000 aircraft engines built during the war.</p><p><span>Expanding aircraft manufacturing also required scaling up manufacturing in related industries. Thousands of aircraft required millions of tons of aluminum (e.g., a single B-17 used about 10 tons of aluminum), and between 1940 and 1943 aluminum manufacturing capacity </span><a href="https://eh.net/encyclopedia/the-american-economy-during-world-war-ii/" rel="">more than quadrupled</a><span> thanks to DPC financing. The aircraft also created an enormous demand for aviation gasoline, and refiners spent nearly a billion dollars of their own money (roughly half of what was spent on the Manhattan Project) to expand aviation gas refining capacity. And the aircraft industry was just one of many industries demanding huge quantities of machine tools, and during the war annual production of machine tools increased by a factor of 50.</span></p><p>Prior to the war, aircraft were produced using small scale, job-shop type manufacturing methods: Individual aircraft were assembled in place piece by piece, largely by hand, not unlike the way cars had been built prior to Ford’s Model T. It was a slow, expensive, and labor-intensive process: On a per-pound basis, it cost about 30 to 40 times as much to build an aircraft than it did a car. And while the auto industry produced 1,500 times the number of cars as the aircraft industry did planes, it did so with just eight times as many workers. In other words, it took almost 200 times as many workers to build an aircraft as it did a car.</p><p><span>In part this was due to the comparatively small volumes of aircraft being built, which precluded the use of capital-intensive manufacturing methods with high upfront costs but low unit costs. But it was also due to the unique challenges of aircraft themselves, which made adopting efficient mass production methods difficult. For one, aircraft were far more complex than other mass-produced goods. While a car had around 5,000 parts, a B-25 bomber had around 165,000, not including the tens of thousands of parts in the engines, instruments, and other equipment, or the 150,000 rivets needed to stitch the plane together. And the performance requirements for aircraft were much higher: An aircraft piston engine, for instance, was much more powerful, much lighter per horsepower, and was pushed much harder than a car engine. A 1930s-era Ford V8 could generate about 85 horsepower, while aircraft engines generated 1,000 to 2,000 horsepower, and a car engine weighed about 6.9 pounds for every horsepower it generated, compared to 1 to 2 pounds for an aircraft engine. And while a car engine rarely exceeded 22% of its maximum power, an aircraft engine regularly ran at maximum power, or even </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_emergency_power" rel="">above maximum power</a><span>.</span></p><p>This meant that aircraft manufacturing had much tighter production tolerances than car manufacturing, and much more machining was required to make parts as light as possible. It also meant using lightweight materials like aluminum sheets and magnesium castings that other manufacturers had limited experience using. Meeting these strict tolerances required greater control over the production environment: Aircraft engine factories were air conditioned to minimize heat fluctuations and kept at constant 50% humidity to minimize surface rust.</p><p>Ensuring aircraft would meet their demanding performance standards also required much more inspection than other types of manufacturing. An aircraft engine and its constituent parts might undergo 70,000 inspections during the manufacturing process. When Ford engineers visited a Pratt &amp; Whitney factory to learn about aircraft engine manufacturing, they initially thought the job “looked easy” and that the quality and precision requirements were excessive, but as they studied the engines, their performance requirements, and the need for reliability, they changed their minds. At a Ford aircraft engine plant that eventually employed around 15,500 workers, 3,000 of them were inspectors.</p><p>Aircraft were also designed and built differently than other mass-produced goods. With most products, parts are heavy and rigid enough that assembly can be done by simply holding them together and fastening them. But aircraft were built from thin sheets of aluminum bent into complex curves, and “mating surfaces,” areas where parts overlap and can be attached, were much smaller. Defining these curves couldn't be done with normal dimensioned drawings, and an elaborate process called “lofting” was used where contours were defined by taking a section of the airplane at uniform spacing, using those contours to build a steel skeleton, and using that skeleton to create a plaster mockup that could be used to create tooling. And during assembly, aircraft required large, elaborate workholding devices to keep the sheets of aluminum aligned in their proper shape as they were fastened together.</p><p>The unique characteristics of aircraft manufacturing meant that new tooling was required not only for existing aircraft manufacturers (to speed up and mechanize their processes), but it was also needed for manufacturers outside the industry already using mass-production methods. When Ford built a facility to manufacture Pratt &amp; Whitney engines at its Rouge plant, its existing tools were only suitable for 10% of the tools needed; the other 90% had to be built new.</p><p>In addition to the new tooling required, existing aircraft drawings were completely unsuitable for large-volume production. Small-volume, job-shop type manufacturing meant that aircraft drawings and production control systems — the system for telling the factory what it should build and when — could be somewhat informal, with much of the critical information kept in factory foremen’s heads. Aircraft designs were often updated by changing factory tooling and templates, without updating the actual drawings, and drawings were often found to be inconsistent. Drawings were also often missing critical information, such as manufacturing tolerances, on the assumption that skilled workers would be able to fill in the blanks.</p><p>Even the seemingly simple task of assembling a complete set of drawings and parts list for an aircraft to be built proved monumentally difficult. When Ford first began work to produce the B-24, it found that drawings only existed for about 80% of the aircraft, and the ones that did exist had numerous inconsistencies. Ford ultimately redid the entire set of drawings, turning the original 7,500 drawings into more than 20,000 that could be more easily understood by workers inexperienced in aircraft manufacturing. Similar efforts were required by nearly every airframe manufacturer as they scaled up operations and transferred their designs to other companies.</p><p>One of the reasons for this poor state of production control, and another difference between aircraft manufacturing and other types of manufacturing, was that aircraft designs were constantly changing. With conventional manufacturing, design of the factory took place once designs were “frozen” and no more major changes to the design would take place. Mass-production factories achieved their high efficiencies by having carefully arranged and timed flows of material, which would be disrupted by major design changes that might require new tools, different parts, and changed material routing.</p><p>But while attempts were made to “freeze” aircraft designs to make manufacturing easier, ultimately this proved infeasible. Designs had to be constantly improved to address deficiencies, improve performance, and deliver aircraft that were capable of overcoming the enemy. Engines were upgraded to be more powerful, parts that were found to fail frequently were redesigned, and new guns and other equipment was installed.&nbsp;</p><p>The P-47 Thunderbolt, for instance, of which more than 15,000 were made, went through five major design revisions (the P-47B, C, D, G, M, and N) and numerous smaller updates. The P-47C had, among other things, a redesigned rudder to prevent failures, the P-47D added more cockpit armor, the M added a new, more powerful engine, and the N had longer wings which held more fuel. Making these improvements required numerous individual changes. Flight testing of the B-29 resulted in 900 design changes before it even began large-scale production. When Chrysler manufactured the Cyclone engine for Pratt &amp; Whitney it had to incorporate more than 6,000 changes over the course of the war, resulting in nearly 50,000 separate change orders. North American’s B-25 first flew in 1940, but over the next five years the company spent roughly two million engineering hours redesigning the aircraft and incorporating changes.</p><p>To balance the need for high-volume production with the need for constant aircraft improvements, the industry adopted an awkward, stopgap measure: the modification center. After leaving the factory, aircraft were flown to another facility that would make the necessary changes.; recent design changes would be incorporated, and any mission-specific customizations would be added. Modification centers were first used in Britain to modify arriving U.S.-built aircraft for British needs, but eventually became widely used in the U.S. to cope with the flood of aircraft changes. Ultimately there were 20 modification centers built in the U.S., and anywhere from 25 to 50% of the labor spent building military aircraft during the war was spent at the modification centers. In part this figure is so high because the work done at modification centers was incredibly inefficient. Not only was it difficult to do work on a completed aircraft, but the modification centers were also often just open, outdoor spaces with tarps covering the cockpit to provide a makeshift working area. A part installation that could be done in minutes in a factory might take hundreds of hours at a modification center. In one case, 8,000 man-hours were spent modifying an aircraft that had only taken 9,000 hours to build in the first place.</p><p>As manufacturing scaled up, aircraft builders had to constantly address bottlenecks that were slowing down production, and as time went on these bottlenecks shifted. Early on the main problem was simply the lack of factories and machine tools to produce the necessary aircraft. As more factories came online, the problem became one of finding sufficient material: The huge increase in output and the fact that manufacturers were incentivized to hoard materials created constant shortages. And finally, the primary bottleneck became finding enough labor to fill the factories. Not only did the aircraft industry need to hire a huge number of workers, but so did every other major war industry, made worse by the fact that the workers they did have were constantly being drafted or volunteering for service.&nbsp;</p><p>The biggest source of untapped labor proved to be women. Though aircraft manufacturers were initially reluctant to hire women, women eventually made up roughly 40% of the aircraft labor force, and in some plants were as high as 90%. But using large numbers of female workers required completely redesigning the production process. Not only were women typically inexperienced in aircraft factory work (as were most male new workers recruited), but they also weren’t as physically strong as men.&nbsp;</p><p>To accommodate inexperienced female factory workers, a variety of changes were implemented. Processes were broken down into simple steps that unskilled workers could do. Part tolerances were relaxed where possible. Tasks were rearranged to be less physically taxing, and aids like trunnion jigs, which parts could be mounted to and freely rotated, were more widely adopted. Tools were redesigned to make them easier to use. Rivet guns, for instance, were redesigned to have counterbalances, which not only reduced the strength required to use them but made it possible to rivet with a single worker where it had previously required two. These redesigns not only made it possible to use women and other unskilled laborers, but also simplified and streamlined the production process — factory managers realized that if a women could do a job swiftly and easily, a man could too, and “practically every job in the catalog was revolutionized”.</p><p>More generally, though the complexities of aircraft manufacturing meant that mass production methods couldn’t be adopted directly, high-volume production did require a transition from job-shop methods to “line” or flow production, where material moved along a production line, smoothly and steadily being transformed into a finished aircraft. Not only was this more efficient at high production volumes, but previous job-shop methods required a highly-skilled labor force that wasn’t available. The pool of labor available — unskilled workers with no experience in aircraft manufacturing — in a very real sense “chose” the production system.</p><p>In addition to changes in shop floor work, expansion forced aircraft industry management to change. In 1935, the five largest aircraft manufacturers employed an average of 1,400 employees each. By 1943, that had ballooned to 100,000 each. Accommodating this required adding many new layers of management, and executives who had previously spent much of their time on the factory floor now found themselves spending most of their time in meetings, or dealing with the endless amounts of paperwork that the government required. Many managers failed to make the transition.</p><p>Making these changes inevitably took time: Nearly every aircraft produced during the war took more than a year to go from the 5th aircraft produced to the 500th aircraft produced. Even manufacturers familiar with mass production methods took time to ramp up. Despite the enormous amount of attention given to Ford’s Willow Run factory that mass-produced B-24 bombers, its performance was mediocre at best. For the first two years the plant produced virtually nothing as it struggled with the difficulties of aircraft production, and the time it took to reach volume production was slower than many existing aircraft manufacturers. At one point operations were going so poorly that the government considered taking over the factory).

Though much attention is given to the incredible increase in production efficiency that occurred during the war for things like Liberty Ships, in large part the efficiency gains were so great because the starting point was so bad: manufacturers were producing things they had never built before, using production methods they didn’t understand. (Indeed, despite the improvements, U.S. manufacturing productivity was </span><a href="https://conversableeconomist.com/2023/02/22/how-wwii-reduced-us-productivity/" rel="">lower at the end of the war than it was in 1941</a><span>).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But manufacturers quickly improved. The job-shop methods of aircraft manufacturing were replaced with line production: Manufacturers installed conveyors and monorails to quickly move material through the factory, and new factories were designed and built with line production in mind to maximize material flow. Work was more finely divided into individual subassemblies to allow increased subcontracting and to have many different people working on portions of the aircraft simultaneously. Manufacturers adopted new, improved high-accuracy machine tools that could automate work and be operated by unskilled labor. Some manufacturers adopted transfer machines, an innovation from the auto industry that combined many separate machines into one, automatically moving material to different steps in the production process. The aircraft themselves were redesigned to be easier to manufacture, and novel production processes (such as </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_casting_(industrial)" rel="">centrifugal casting</a><span>, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroforming" rel="">hydroforming</a><span>, and the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_pad_forming" rel="">Guerin process</a><span>) were developed or more widely adopted to speed up work. Novel inspection methods, such as </span><a href="https://www.twi-global.com/what-we-do/services-and-support/asset-management/non-destructive-testing/ndt-techniques/radiography-testing" rel="">radiographic inspection</a><span>, were also developed. Better tools and workholding systems were developed, tasks were redesigned, and material routing along the factory floor was improved to reduce travel distances. Production and material control systems were improved, eventually making it possible to incorporate major design changes on the factory floor and eliminate the need for modification centers. Standardized procedures for things like quality control were developed, and best practices were shared between different manufacturers.&nbsp;</span></p><p>As a result of these improvements, the time it took to build an aircraft steadily fell as manufacturers advanced along the learning curve. In 1941 Boeing required more than 140,000 hours of labor to assemble a B-17. By 1944, that had fallen to less than 20,000. The cost to produce aircraft fell on average by 32% over the course of the war.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5fbb3f0-53ff-4fb4-abe4-691d8b34bf4d_701x342.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5fbb3f0-53ff-4fb4-abe4-691d8b34bf4d_701x342.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5fbb3f0-53ff-4fb4-abe4-691d8b34bf4d_701x342.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5fbb3f0-53ff-4fb4-abe4-691d8b34bf4d_701x342.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5fbb3f0-53ff-4fb4-abe4-691d8b34bf4d_701x342.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5fbb3f0-53ff-4fb4-abe4-691d8b34bf4d_701x342.png" width="701" height="342" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d5fbb3f0-53ff-4fb4-abe4-691d8b34bf4d_701x342.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:342,&quot;width&quot;:701,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5fbb3f0-53ff-4fb4-abe4-691d8b34bf4d_701x342.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5fbb3f0-53ff-4fb4-abe4-691d8b34bf4d_701x342.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5fbb3f0-53ff-4fb4-abe4-691d8b34bf4d_701x342.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5fbb3f0-53ff-4fb4-abe4-691d8b34bf4d_701x342.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Via Buying Aircraft</figcaption></figure></div><p>As late as 1941, the U.K. was building more planes per year than the U.S. But by 1942, the U.S. was building roughly as many aircraft as Germany, Japan, the U.K. and Italy combined. And by 1944, U.S. aircraft production was so voluminous that the Army and Navy were having trouble dealing with them all. Not wanting to shut down the plants for fear of losing the expertise contained within them, the U.S. simply began to dispose of old planes to make way for new ones.</p><blockquote><p><em><span>As a measure of the industrial might of the United States in 1944 and 1945, the subsequent whirl of destruction told a better story than a thousand pages of statistics. If a plane needed minor repairs, it was pulled off the flight line and junked, and a shiny new replacement unit flew in to take its place. Hundreds of airplanes were flown into remote Pacific island airstrips, parked in a vacant clearing, and abandoned. Many such aircraft “boneyards” were later used for target practice by U.S. bombers on training missions. Scrapped airplanes were bulldozed into pits, and the wreckage compacted by running tanks over them. Marginally damaged carrier planes were pushed off the flight decks into the sea, and new replacement units flown in from escort carriers. This mass-junking of perfectly serviceable warplanes occurred </span><strong>at the height of the war</strong><span>, when the Japanese were falling well short of aircraft production targets and struggling to keep their assembly lines in operation at all. - Twilight of the Gods</span></em></p></blockquote><p>By the end of the war, some aircraft were being flown directly from the factory to junkyards for scrap.</p><p><span>When the war ended, this enormous production machine was dismantled. Tens of thousands of excess aircraft were flown to boneyards and left to rot. The enormous aircraft plants built at government expense were far larger than the aircraft industry needed outside of wartime, and few manufacturers wanted them. Plants were sold off by the government, often at a tiny fraction of what it cost to build them, and repurposed for a variety of endeavors. Some became airports, like the Douglas factory that eventually became </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Hare_International_Airport" rel="">O’Hare</a><span>. Others were used for car manufacturing: Ford’s Willow Run factory was sold to Henry Kaiser for his </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser-Frazer" rel="">Kaiser-Frazer</a><span> automobile company, and the failed </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_48" rel="">Tucker</a><span> and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy_Automobile_Company" rel="">Playboy Motors</a><span> also set up shop in former aircraft factories. What had been the largest factory in the world, the Dodge Chicago aircraft plant was used to briefly produce a factory-built house, the </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/the-lustron-home" rel="">Lustron Home</a><span>.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-144851894" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-to-build-300000-airplanes-in#footnote-3-144851894" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>A similar fate befell much of the tooling used to build the aircraft. The tools, jigs, and fixtures were often specific to certain aircraft and couldn’t be repurposed, and the machinery was often only useful for high-volume production. It too, was scrapped.</p><p>Looking back 70 years later, U.S. aircraft manufacturing during WWII looks like an unqualified success. The U.S. turned itself from a tiny producer of aircraft to manufacturing an unending, overwhelming stream of planes that proved critical to the war effort.</p><p>But this success was highly contingent. The U.S. was woefully unprepared to expand its aircraft industry. The U.S. didn’t have the proper aircraft developed going into the war, and the medium and heavy bombers that proved crucial to victory couldn’t be produced in large numbers until relatively late in the war. Neither the government nor the industry had the organizational infrastructure in place to handle the scale up, or plans for creating it: Most army mobilization plans implicitly assumed that industrial mobilization was like flipping a switch, and that on “M-Day” the industry would immediately switch to wartime production.</p><p>But scaling up an industry doesn’t work like that. It wasn’t until 1942, three years after Germany invaded Poland and France and Britain declared war on Germany in response, that U.S. aircraft production truly ramped up, and even this was only possible because of enormous early orders from Britain and France, and the work of far-sighted folks like Bill Knudsen who knew how long it took to scale up manufacturing operations. Had events occurred slightly differently, the outcome of the aircraft industry scale-up, and perhaps the war itself, might have looked very different.</p><p>World War II aircraft production shows that it's possible for a complex manufacturing industry to grow incredibly rapidly. But it also shows the limits of that scale up; that even in an emergency some things can only be accelerated so much, and success depends on what preparations have been taken beforehand.</p></div></div>]]></description>

</p><p>QED</p>

<h3 id="exact-values">Exact Values</h3>

<p>Through what appears to be a remarkable series of coincidences, there is a relatively simple closed form evaluation of \(g_k\) using only Knuth up-arrows and arithmetic:</p>

<p>Theorem: For all \(k \ge 0, m \ge 0\):</p><p>

\[2 g_{k+1}(m) + 4 = 2 \uparrow^k (2m+4)\]

</p><p>(where we define \(a \uparrow^0 b = ab\))</p>

<p>Proof by Induction on \(k\):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Base case (\(k = 0\)):</li>
</ul><p>

\[\begin{array}{l}
  g_1(m)        &amp; = &amp; g_0^{2m+2}(0) &amp; = &amp; 2m+2 \\
  2 g_1(m) + 4  &amp; = &amp; 2 (2m+2) + 4 &amp; = &amp; 4m + 8 &amp; = &amp; 2 \uparrow^0 (2m+4) \\
\end{array}\]

</p><ul>
  <li>Inductive case: Assume \(\forall m \ge 0: 2 g_{k+1}(m) + 4 = 2 \uparrow^k (2m+4)\):</li>
</ul><p>

\[\begin{array}{l}
  2 g_{k+1}(m) + 4    &amp; = &amp; 2 \uparrow^k (2m+4) \\
  2 g_{k+1}^n(m) + 4  &amp; = &amp; (2 \uparrow^k)^n (2m+4) \\
  2 g_{k+2}(m) + 4    &amp; = &amp; g_{k+1}^{2m+2}(0) = (2 \uparrow^k)^{2m+2} 4 = (2 \uparrow^k)^{2m+2} (2 \uparrow^k 2) \\
                      &amp; = &amp; 2 \uparrow^{k+1} (2m+4) \\
\end{array}\]

</p><p>QED</p>

<p>Note: This depends upon the coincidence that \(2 \uparrow^k 2 = 4\) for all \(k\). If the parameters had been slightly different and we’d ended up with \((2 \uparrow^k)^{2m+2} 5\) above, I don’t think it would have been possible to get a closed form expression.</p>

<p>Corollary: For all \(k \ge 0, n \ge 0\):</p><p>

\[2 g_k^n(0) + 4 = 2 \uparrow^k (n+2)\]

</p><p>From which it follows directly that:</p><p>

\[\sigma = 2 g_{15}^{3}(0) + 18 = (2 \uparrow^{15} 5) + 14\]

</p><h2 id="permutations">Permutations</h2><p>

\[\begin{array}{lcl}
  0^\infty \;\; \text{B&gt;} \;\; 0^\infty &amp; \xrightarrow{86} &amp; B(7, 3, 0) \;\; 2 \;\; 0^\infty \\
  0^\infty \;\; \text{C&gt;} \;\; 0^\infty &amp; \xrightarrow{20} &amp; B(1, 3, 0) \;\; 2 \;\; 0^\infty \\
\end{array}\]

</p><p>Therefore, we can see that if we switch to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Starting in state <code>B</code>, the TM halts with a score of \(\sigma_B = 2 g_6^3(0) + 9 = (2 \uparrow^6 5) + 5\)</li>
  <li>Starting in state <code>C</code>, the TM halts with a score of \(\sigma_C = 2 g_0^3(0) + 3 = (2 \uparrow^0 5) - 1 = 9\) (which it does at step 72).</li>
</ul>

<p>This first permutation (start state <code>B</code>) appears to be the second best known BB(3, 4) TM. Converted into TNF it is:</p>

<p><code>1RB3RB1LC2LA_2LA2RB1LB3RA_3LA1RZ1LC2RA</code></p>

<h2 id="not-collatz">Not Collatz</h2>

<p>One interesting thing about this TM is how surprisingly simple it is. For example, the fact that it does not have any Collatz-like rules (rules which act differently depending on the remainder of some value). Is this the end of the domination of Collatz-like TMs? It is far too early to know, but my guess is that there are Collatz-like Ackermann-level TMs waiting for us, but we are not seeing them right away because of selection bias. Perhaps this was the first Ackermann-level TM found because it is simple enough to be proven halting without having to implement modular arithmetic on Ackermann-level functions.</p>

<h2 id="inductive-proof-validator">Inductive Proof Validator</h2>

<p>This TM was the perfect test case for an “inductive proof” validator I am currently developing. The goal of this project is to develop a standardized certificate format for “inductive proofs” (an umbrella term for all the sort of forward-reasoning, rule-based analyses that are ubiquitous on this blog). The idea is that anyone with an “inductive decider” could write out their rules in this format and then this validator can check these proofs. The system is still very clunky and not ready for prime time, but I have been able (with a little elbow grease) to use it to prove the behavior of many TMs including <a href="https://github.com/sligocki/busy-beaver/blob/49864afd99263b6f18bec0dee028a3b56aa70936/rust/src/validator.rs#L978">this one</a>.</p>

        <h2>Disappointment</h2>
      <p>Danny Calegari</p></section>
  
    <section id="ltxid3" data-ams-doc="section" data-ams-doc-level="1">
      <p>In high school I took part in many math competitions; the hardest (and therefore to my teenage mind the only ones that counted) were the competitions relating to the international mathematical olympiad (IMO). In Melbourne there was a program of competition and training that culminated in a nine hour exam spread over two days to determine the makeup of the Australian IMO team. I remember very well the first time I took the exam. It was 1987, and the IMO was to be held that year in Cuba. As I sat at my carrel in the Morris library, I took the February sunlight for fortune smiling on me, inspiration spilled liberally from my Pelikano steel nib fountain pen, and I went home at the end of the second day in a blur of fatigue and self-congratulation. Six weeks later a pregnant manila envelope arrived in the mail. From its girth alone I knew I had aced the exam and won my rightful spot on the team. Before even opening the envelope I could see myself in the green woolen team blazer with the Australian coat of arms embroidered on the breast pocket, and by the time I found a letter opener I was shaking hands with Fidel Castro.</p>
      <p>The envelope contained…sixty-odd sheets of loose-leaf paper, no invitation, no cover letter: my exam papers, bloodstained with question marks, lines through paragraphs, squiggles of uncomprehension, Xs and Os. My stomach fell. I blushed. In a fraction of a second I rewrote or recolored dozens of memories and fantasies from the recent past and future, and became intensely conscious of and embarassed by my vanity and foolishness. What I now find remarkable was the speed and scope of my transformation; the analogy that comes to mind is being struck by a speeding car.</p>
      <p>So how does one deal with disappointment? Freud, in <em>Civilization and Its Discontents</em> identifies three typical measures:</p>
      <blockquote data-ams-style="null">
        <p>powerful deflections, which cause us to make light of our misery; substitutive satisfactions, which diminish it; and intoxicating substances, which make us insensible to it.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>If these are the typical responses, are there any others? Before trying to answer this it might be helpful first to articulate what disappointment actually <em>is</em>, and then to ask what it’s <em>for</em>. Evidently, disappointment is a form of mental suffering. It is so unpleasant that we can experience it in a host of physiological dimensions. Profound mental suffering involves a complex array of interactions between any number of processes and subsystems, both conscious and unconscious, involving both the brain and the limbic system. The suffering that arises from disappointment is that that accompanies disruption: disappointment causes a certain kind of shake-up or realignment of our worldview and self-image and consequently of our priorities; this disruption can be so great that we sometimes emerge from it a very different person.</p>
      <p>According to certain schools of cognitive science (e.g., Minsky’s <em>Society of Mind</em> model) the idea of a “self” as a unified, indivisible entity is an oversimplification; rather (they suggest) a self is an uneasy federation of simpler subsystems (sometimes termed “agents”) with their own local goals and interests, which are frequently in competition with one another. Under ordinary circumstances stability is achieved by a complicated system of temporary alliances, detentes, three-way standoffs, and so forth. Our subjective sense of the unified self is—in itself!—also a source of stability. Sometimes a dramatic change in (real or perceived) external circumstances—an unforseen event, an unpleasant discovery—can lead to a cascade of disruptions to this order. This is the mechanism of disappointment, and why it is so painful; it is both a crisis and an opportunity—in Homer Simpson’s inspired terminology, a crisitunity.</p>
      <p>Disappointment measures in pain the gap between reality and what we want the world to be. Disappointment matters. It matters because we don’t actually live in the real world. We live in our heads, in a mental world of assumptions, recollections, anticipations, desires and conjectures. And even when we do meet reality, it’s a mistake to think that what our senses feed us is objective, unfiltered, unsorted. Rather we operate according to an interrogative protocol—we ask the world questions to confirm what we already “know” (or, more accurately: hope), and only when we get an unpleasant surprise do we take a closer look. As Proust says,</p>
      <blockquote data-ams-style="null">
        <p>The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes. Happiness is beneficial for the body, but it is grief that develops the powers of the mind.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In his famous paper, “How not to prove the Poincaré Conjecture,” John Stallings writes about an adventure in his mathematical life, how he discovered a proof of the Poincaré Conjecture but later found it to be mistaken. He goes so far as to describe this episode as a “sin;” but the sin was not in the mistake per se, rather it was his resistance to recognizing it as such. He writes,</p>
      <blockquote data-ams-style="null">
        <p>There are two points about this incorrect proof worthy of note …(t)he second…is that I was unable to find flaws in my ‘proof’ for quite a while, even though the error is very obvious. It was a psychological problem, a blindness, an excitement, an inhibition of reasoning by an underlying fear of being wrong. Techniques leading to the abandonment of such inhibitions should be cultivated by every honest mathematician.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Few mathematicians are as honest or as generous as Stallings in sharing their own stories of disappointment. This is because disappointment often comes wrapped in shame, because our goals are inextricable from our personal and social attachments and relationships. Convention and social norms dictate that any display of human weakness or failing is “unprofessional.” We’re not supposed to admit it when we feel stupid, or underappreciated, or jealous, or that we cared so much about something that when it didn’t go our way we felt shattered. Techniques leading to the abandonment of such inhibitions should be cultivated by every honest mathematician.</p>
      <p>Disappointment takes many forms; a partial list from my personal history includes:</p>
      <dl data-ams-content-type="enumerate">
        <div><dt id="ltxid4">(1)</dt> <dd><p>being un- or under-acknowledged in a colleague’s paper or talk;</p></dd></div>

      </dl>
      <p>The last one, perhaps, deserves elaboration. Some acute disappointments in my career were the result of getting what I thought I wanted: a paper in a fancy journal; a job offer; tenure; an invitation to talk at a fancy conference. I don’t mean to diminish the value of such things at all, or the challenges (personal or structural) many people must overcome to achieve them; much about the way such “rewards” are distributed in academic culture is unfair, often in systematic ways, and it should be the goal of all of us to point this out and work to change it wherever we can. I also don’t mean to suggest that success has been joyless; the opposite is true. Nevertheless it is the case that sometimes when we get what we think we want, we discover that these things weren’t what we thought they were, and (more importantly) that we are not who we though we were. When disappointment accompanies success it is worth paying special attention to. If we get what we want but it doesn’t bring us fulfillment, then what’s really going on? In my experience, it has only been at the point of my posing this question that I have acquired insight, and the agency to really change things or come to terms with them.</p>
      <p>It took a month of pain after the manila envelope arrived before curiosity got the better of me and I opened it again. And a remarkable thing happened. The exam pages: my answers, the blots, the corrections, the red ink, the comments, were exactly as before. But time and some strange alchemy of which disappointment itself was the catalyst had altered their meaning. An actual human being had taken the time to read my work and share valuable feedback with me. My annotated exam was no longer a certificate of failure, it was a how-to manual: it was about how to prove an inequality by leveraging the convexity of a cleverly chosen auxiliary function, or how to recast a geometric figure in terms of complex numbers and understand it with algebra. These math problems weren’t “problems” at all: they were windows into mathematics itself. And the manila envelope wasn’t a slap in the face, it was a gift; but to see it as a gift I had to see it with new eyes. I never got to Cuba, but I’d taken my first steps on a longer and far more interesting and rewarding journey that continues to this day.</p>

<p>WAITS V. FRITO-LAY, INC., 978 F.2D 1093</p>

<p>In September and October 1988, some 250 American radio-stations aired a commercial to introduce a new&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fritolay.com/">Frito-Lay</a>&nbsp;product (SalsaRio Doritos corn chips) featuring a song very similar to Waits's "Step Right Up" (performed by Waits impersonator Stephen Carter).</p>

<p>&lt;object classid="CLSID:22d6f312-b0f6-11d0-94ab-0080c74c7e95" codebase="http://activex.microsoft.com/activex/controls/mplayer/en/nsmp2inf.cab#%20Version=5,1,52,701" height="46" id="MediaPlayer1" standby="Loading Microsoft Windows� Media Player components..." type="application/x-oleobject" width="320"&gt;&lt;embed autostart="0" height="46" name="MediaPlayer1" pluginspage="http://www.microsoft.com/Windows/MediaPlayer/" showcontrols="1" src="http://www.tomwaitslibrary.info/audio/fritolay.m3u" type="application/x-mplayer2" volume="-300" width="320"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/object&gt;</p>

<p>Waits himself apparently first heard the commercial when he was at the Los Angeles radio station KCRW to do an interview (KCRW-FM: Morning Becomes Eclectic. October 3, 1988). Since the mid- 1970's Waits had spoken out against doing commercials. As a matter of fact, the song "Step Right Up" itself was condemning business talk in the music industry and in general. One can imagine Waits was not amused when he heard Carter sing: "<i>It's buffo, boffo, bravo, gung ho, tallyho, but never mellow / Try 'em, buy 'em, get 'em, got 'em!</i>" Waits was outraged. He realized "immediately that whoever was going to hear this and obviously identify the voice would also identify that Tom Waits in fact had agreed to do a commercial for Doritos."<sup>(5)</sup></p>

<p>In November 1988 Waits sued&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fritolay.com/">Frito-Lay Inc</a>. and its advertising agency&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tlp.com/">Tracy-Locke Inc</a>., alleging claims of:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>-&nbsp;<b>False endorsement&nbsp;</b>(under the Lanham (Federal trademark) Act. This act prohibits the use of false designations of origin, false descriptions, and false representations in the advertising and sale of goods and services)<br>
-&nbsp;<b>Misappropriation of his voice</b>&nbsp;(under California law)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>A false endorsement claim based on the unauthorized use of a celebrity's identity is a type of false association claim, for it alleges the misuse of a trademark, i.e., a symbol or device such as a visual likeness, vocal imitation, or other uniquely distinguishing characteristic, which is likely to confuse consumers as to the plaintiff's sponsorship or approval of the product.<sup>(5)</sup></p>

<p>Waits testified that when he heard the Doritos commercial, "this corn chip sermon," he was shocked and very angry. These feelings "grew and grew over a period of a couple of days" because of his strong public opposition to doing commercials. Waits testified, "It embarrassed me. I had to call all my friends, that if they hear this thing, please be informed this is not me. I was on the phone for days. I also had people calling me saying, Gee, Tom, I heard the new Doritos ad." Added to this evidence of Waits' shock, anger, and embarrassment is the strong inference that, because of his outspoken public stance against doing commercial endorsements, the Doritos commercial humiliated Waits by making him an apparent hypocrite.<sup>(5)</sup>&nbsp;The jury could have inferred from the evidence that the commercial created a public impression that Waits was a hypocrite for endorsing Doritos. Moreover, it also could have inferred damage to his artistic reputation, for Waits had testified that "part of my character and personality and image that I have cultivated is that I do not endorse products."<sup>(5)</sup></p>

<p>Tom Waits did not sue Frito-Lay for copyright infringement. At the time Waits didn't own the copyright (in the work of authorship) to the song "Step Right Up". This was, and is, owned by Fifth Floor Music Inc (controlled by Martin/ Herb, Evan Cohen). One might assume Frito-Lay did indeed obtain the "synch" license from Fifth Floor Music to use the song in the commercial. And as they were not using the song as recorded by Waits himself, they didn't have to worry about copyright in the musical work (owned by Elektra/ Asylum). Had Waits at that time owned the copyrights to the song, he would surely have sued for copyright infringement. Publicity rights allow a person to control the use of his name or likeness in association with the sale of a commercial product. Waits sued for "false endorsement" (the public was led to believe that Waits was singing, and this deception violated Waits' publicity rights by associating him with a commercial product he did not want to endorse) and "misappropriation of his voice" (suggesting there was as a matter of fact something recognizable and distinctive as: "his voice"). Had Frito-Lay used the music only or used a voice that sounded nothing like Waits', Waits would probably not have had a case. But Frito-Lay somehow wanted the "real thing."</p>

<p><b>Jay S. Jacobs</b>&nbsp;(2000): "<em>Waits's song "Step Right Up," on Small Change is a parody of hucksterism, couched in the same angry language Waits used when he spoke to interviewers about art peddling. The mystery product that the song's persona is hustling does everything and nothing. It'll shine your car. Get rid of embarrassing stains. Lie to your wife. Pay off your credit cards. Walk the dog and pick up the kids at school. Make you six foot five, blond, and beautiful. Do your taxes. Return your tapes to the video store. And then, when you're done with it, it'll turn into a six-pack of beer and a pizza. Who in the world could take "Step Right Up" seriously as a sales pitch? Well, Frito-Lay did. The snack-food giant actually hit on the notion that "Step Right Up" would make the perfect jingle to introduce their newest corn-chip flavor, Salsa Rio Doritos. A hot and spicy song for a hot and spicy chip. They couldn't use their old corporate spokescartoon, the Frito Bandito; he'd been forced to retire during the seventies when a Mexican group protested that he was nothing but a racist stereotype. So, since they couldn't have their Bandito, the Frito-Lay people wanted the next best thing: Tom Waits</em>."&nbsp;<sup>(1)</sup></p>

<p><img alt="cop" height="250" src="http://www.tomwaitslibrary.info/images/imagesextras/fritobandito.jpg" width="224"><br>
Waits's predecessor&nbsp;<a href="http://64.41.109.149/school/bandito.html">Frito Bandito</a>: "The bandito character was created by animation legend Tex Avery<br>
for a commercial ad campaign in the late 1960's"</p>

<p>The 9th Circuit Court decision documents some entertaining background information on how Frito-Lay came to this particular commercial:</p>

<p>"<i>The story of Tracy-Locke's search for a lead singer for the commercial suggests that no one would do but a singer who could not only capture the feeling of "Step Right Up" but also imitate Tom Waits' voice. The initial efforts of the ad agency's creative team, using a respected professional singer with a deep bluesy voice, met with disapproval from executives at both Tracy- Locke and Frito-Lay. Tracy-Locke then auditioned a number of other singers who could sing in a gravelly style. Stephen Carter was among those who auditioned. A recording engineer who was acquainted with Carter's work had recommended him to Tracy-Locke as someone who did a good Tom Waits imitation. Carter was a professional musician from Dallas and a Tom Waits fan. Over ten years of performing Waits songs as part of his band's repertoire, he had consciously perfected an imitation of Waits' voice. When Carter auditioned, members of the Tracy-Locke creative team "did a double take" over Carter's near-perfect imitation of Waits, and remarked to him how much he sounded like Waits. In fact, the commercial's musical director warned Carter that he probably wouldn't get the job because he sounded too much like Waits, which could pose legal problems. Carter, however, did get the job. At the recording session for the commercial David Brenner, Tracy-Locke's executive producer, became concerned about the legal implications of Carter's skill in imitating Waits, and attempted to get Carter to "back off" his Waits imitation. Neither the client nor the members of the creative team, however, liked the result. After the session, Carter remarked to Brenner that Waits would be unhappy with the commercial because of his publicly avowed policy against doing commercial endorsements and his disapproval of artists who did. Brenner acknowledged he was aware of this, telling Carter that he had previously approached Waits to do a Diet Coke commercial and "you never heard anybody say no so fast in your life." Brenner conveyed to Robert Grossman, Tracy-Locke's managing vice president and the executive on the Frito-Lay account, his concerns that the commercial was too close to Waits' voice. As a precaution, Brenner made an alternate version of the commercial with another singer. On the day the commercial was due for release to radio stations across the country, Grossman had a ten-minute long-distance telephone consultation with Tracy-Locke's attorney, asking him whether there would be legal problems with a commercial that sought to capture the same feeling as Waits' music. The attorney noted that there was a "high profile" risk of a lawsuit in view of recent case law recognizing the protectability of a distinctive voice. Based on what Grossman had told him, however, the attorney did not think such a suit would have merit, because a singer's style of music is not protected. Grossman then presented both the Carter tape and the alternate version to Frito-Lay, noting the legal risks involved in the Carter version. He recommended the Carter version, however, and noted that Tracy-Locke would indemnify Frito-Lay in the event of a lawsuit. Frito-Lay chose the Carter version</i>."<sup>(5)</sup></p>

<p>The case was tried before a jury in April and May 1990. Waits did not include Stephen Carter in the suit because Carter had only been paid scale for his participation. In fact, Carter became one of Waits's strongest witnesses. He felt badly about his part in the fiasco and wanted to redeem himself.<sup>(1)</sup></p>

<p><b>Tom Waits</b>&nbsp;(1992): "<i>They imitated my voice. The guy who did the voice was like a fan of mine who does an impersonation of me and lives in Texas; plays in a band... He felt so bad that he did this. He knew when he did it he was doing a bad thing. But he vindicated himself by helping us win the case</i>."<sup>(3)</sup></p>

<p><b>Tom Waits</b>&nbsp;(1999): "<i>This guy from Texas got paid 300 bucks to do me. That was his specialty, anyway, that he does this perfect impersonation of me. And they did this whole thing around "Step Right Up," and every now and then they would say "Fritos" or whatever. And afterward, the guy felt so bad, he came out as our star witness.</i>"<sup>(2)</sup></p>

<p>After (a four week) trial before Judge James Ideman in the United States District Court (Central District of California)<sup>(4)</sup>, the jury returned a $2.6 million verdict in Waits' favor comprised of:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>-&nbsp;<b>$375,000 in actual compensatory damages</b>, for infringement of the right of publicity/ false endorsement (including $100,000 for the fair market value of Waits' services under the Lanham Act claim. $200,000 for injury to his peace, happiness, and feelings. $75,000 for injury to his goodwill, professional standing, and future publicity value);<br>
-&nbsp;<b>$2,000,000 in punitive damages</b>&nbsp;for voice misappropriation ($1.5 million against Tracy-Locke and $500,000 against Frito- Lay);<br>
-&nbsp;<b>$100,000 damages for violation of the Lanham Act</b><br>
-&nbsp;<b>$125,000</b>&nbsp;Attorney fees</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Tom Waits</b>&nbsp;(1992): "<i>I haven't seen a dime. These things go on forever and forever. Never get involved in litigation. Your hair will fall out, your bones will turn to sand. And it will still be going on. "It was like throwing a rock through a window-but you wait for five years to hear the sound. Litigation is like picking up a glass of water with a prosthetic hand. It's very frustrating, and you'll never get it to your lips. But when you have to, you have to. If somebody burned your house down, you'd have to do something about it.</i>"<sup>(3)</sup></p>

<p>Defendants Frito-Lay Inc. and Tracy-Locke Inc. appealed on December 3, 1991.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In challenging the judgment on Waits'&nbsp;<b>false endorsement claim</b><sup>(5)</sup><br>
- that Waits lacks standing to sue for false endorsement. Asserting that because he is not in competition with the defendants, he cannot sue under the Lanham Act.<br>
- that Waits did not establish his claim at trial, and that damages and attorney's fees were improperly awarded. Because it is duplicative</p>

<p>In challenging the judgment on Waits' voice&nbsp;<b>misappropriation claim</b><sup>(5)</sup><br>
- that the decision, recognizing voice misappropriation as a California tort, is no longer good law.<br>
- that the district court erred in instructing the jury on the elements of voice misappropriation.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Discussing the right of publicity, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the jury's verdict that the defendants had committed the "Midler tort" by misappropriating Tom Waits' voice for commercial purposes. The Midler tort is a species of violation of the right of publicity that protects against the unauthorized imitation of a celibrity's voice which is distinctive and widely known, for commercial purposes.<sup>(6)</sup>&nbsp;On August 5, 1992 the 9th Circuit Court vacated the award of damages under the Lanham Act as duplicative of the damages awarded for infringement of the right of publicity, but affirmed all other aspects of the verdict and judgment. Waits had won...</p>

<p><i><b>Waits v. Frito-Lay, Inc., 978 F.2d 1093 (9th Cir. 1992):</b></i><br>
"<i>Waits' voice misappropriation claim and his Lanham Act claim are legally sufficient. The court did not err in instructing the jury on elements of voice misappropriation. The jury's verdict on each claim is supported by substantial evidence, as are its damage awards. Its award of damages on Waits' Lanham Act claim, however, is duplicative of damages awarded for voice misappropriation; accordingly we vacate it. Finally, the court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorneys' fees under the Lanham Act. Waits is awarded his costs on appeal.</i>"<sup>(5)</sup></p>

<p><b>Tom Waits&nbsp;</b>(2002): "<i>... Yeah, we nailed 'em. It was David and Goliath... They were lame. The problem with a big company like that is that its hands don't talk to its feet, and nobody knows what anyone else is doing. In this case, it was an ad agency that hired a fan of mine actually, in Texas. And they paid him like 60 bucks to come in and do an impersonation of me. Then, a little later, I was doing a radio interview, and the guy says we have to break for a commercial, so he punches that ad in... I said that guy sounds just like me. I mean, there's a lot of things I can't remember, but I think I would have remembered doing that. I had an excellent attorney that went to bat for us.</i>"<sup>(7)</sup></p>

<p><b>Tom Waits</b>&nbsp;(1999): "<i>Two and a half million bucks. Spent it all on candy. My mom told me I was foolish. I've always been foolish when it comes to money....</i>"<sup>(8)</sup></p>

<p><b>Perception of Doors</b><sup>(9)</sup>&nbsp;<br>

<p>Woodland Hills, Calif.</p>

<p><i>Thank you for your&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20020708&amp;s=densmore">eloquent "rant" by John Densmore</a>&nbsp;of The Doors on the subject of artists allowing their songs to be used in commercials ["Riders on the Storm," July 8]. I spoke out whenever possible on the topic even before the Frito Lay case (Waits v. Frito Lay), where they used a sound-alike version of my song "Step Right Up" so convincingly that I thought it was me. Ultimately, after much trial and tribulation, we prevailed and the court determined that my voice is my property.</i></p>

<p><i>Songs carry emotional information and some transport us back to a poignant time, place or event in our lives. It's no wonder a corporation would want to hitch a ride on the spell these songs cast and encourage you to buy soft drinks, underwear or automobiles while you're in the trance. Artists who take money for ads poison and pervert their songs. It reduces them to the level of a jingle, a word that describes the sound of change in your pocket, which is what your songs become. Remember, when you sell your songs for commercials, you are selling your audience as well.</i></p>

<p><i>When I was a kid, if I saw an artist I admired doing a commercial, I'd think, "Too bad, he must really need the money." But now it's so pervasive. It's a virus. Artists are lining up to do ads. The money and exposure are too tantalizing for most artists to decline. Corporations are hoping to hijack a culture's memories for their product. They want an artist's audience, credibility, good will and all the energy the songs have gathered as well as given over the years. They suck the life and meaning from the songs and impregnate them with promises of a better life with their product.</i></p>

<p><i>Eventually, artists will be going onstage like race-car drivers covered in hundreds of logos. John, stay pure. Your credibility, your integrity and your honor are things no company should be able to buy.</i></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Next</span> Global stock-market share registry operator Computershare looks like it has just decided to bail from VMware rather than suffer Broadcom’s latest licensing regime and price hikes.</p>
<p>Speaking during the closing keynote of Nutanix’s Next conference in Barcelona on Wednesday, Computershare's CTO Kevin O’Connor was asked how he feels Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware has played out.</p>
<p>O’Connor replied that when he arrived 18 months ago he found the IT department using two hypervisors: Nutanix AHV, and another from what he described as coming from “a well-known competitor." Cough, VMware. The CTO felt two hypervisors was one too many and considered a consolidation, but the numbers didn’t stack up and no project was initiated.</p>

    

<p>He later received a phone call he said took place after what he described as “the change.” And in that conversation he was quoted a future price for Computershare’s non-Nutanix hypervisor that represented an increase by a factor of between 10 and 15.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/21/nutanix_vmware_migrations/">CIO who dropped VMware 18 months ago now feeling thoroughly chuffed</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/15/veeam_adds_support_for_vmware/">Veeam adds support for VMware alternative Proxmox to its backup software</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/14/vmware_workstation_pro_fusion_pro/">VMware giving away Workstation Pro, Fusion Pro free for personal use</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/12/hyperv_maximums_windows_server_2005/">Microsoft gives Hyper-V ceilings a Herculean hike</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Migrating to AHV suddenly made a lot more sense and O’Connor has pulled the trigger. Over the next year, before that massively inflated bill falls due, Computershare will migrate 24,000 VMs to Nutanix.</p>
<p>O’Connor said the project will pay for itself in “single digit months.”</p>

        


        

<p>“Surprisingly, we've come out of this a lot stronger and leaner with cost base lower than it was before the acquisition,” he said without specifying which acquisition. “We're actually quite delighted it's spurred us to do what we should have done anyway.”</p>
<h3><em>Register</em> comment</h3>
<p>The facts mentioned by O’Connor and the Nutanix emcee in the keynote give <i>The Register</i> a very high degree of confidence that Computershare is quitting VMware.</p>
<p>If so, this smells like a little bit of trouble for Broadcom because earlier today, Steve McDowell, chief analyst at NAND research, told <i>The Register</i> that VMware by Broadcom is “laser focused on high-revenue, high-margin business” and has priced its wares “just below the pain threshold for customers they care about.”</p>
<p><i>The Register</i> has no insight into whether Broadcom cares about Computershare, but we do know it has concentrated its efforts on working with business that want to go all in on its Cloud Foundation stack - and the breadth of that bundle means customers are nearly always large entities.</p>

        

<p>Computershare is certainly large: The Australian company had revenue of $3.3 billion last year, its 14,000-plus staff work across more than 20 countries, serving 40,000 clients and 75 million end-customers. All of which requires 24,000 VMs, which isn't the largest fleet around but also certainly isn't trivial.</p>
<p><i>The Register</i> imagines that calculating pain thresholds is an imprecise science. If Broadcom consistently gets it wrong then Computershare’s experience shows customers of its size and ilk will seek relief. ®</p>

<section id="M2dir-treating-mails-as-files-without-going-crazy">

<p>Sometime <del>recently</del> <ins><a href="https://bitfehler.srht.site/posts/2023-09-07_sorry--maildir--i-am-breaking-up-with-you.html">in the past</a></ins> I complained about Maildir.
You can go read the post, but the executive summary is that I think Maildir
uses an actively user-hostile directory structure and extremely convoluted
filenames that do not convey any meaning at all. For good measure, I will also
reiterate that Maildir does this for a good reason, and is simply often being
used for a purpose it wasn’t designed for - storing your mails locally.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there seem to be no real alternatives. The only other common
format for storing mails locally is <em>mbox</em>. But it stores all messages in a
single file, which is unacceptable if you’d like to access them with regular
tools.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> if you have never had the desire or need to access your mails like a
regular file, this post is likely not of interest to you. If you did, or at
least find the idea intriguing, read on, because I am looking for feedback! 😎</p>
<p>And so, without further ado, I present to you: <a href="https://man.sr.ht/~bitfehler/m2dir">m2dir</a>. If you like
specifications, just go and read the whole thing, why not. But for those only
mildly curious so far, I’ll spell out the basic idea and provide an example
here.</p>
<section id="The-gist-of-it">
<h2>The gist of it</h2>
<p>To get you started, the main design principles of m2dir are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
each message is a file, with a static <a id="fnref1" href="#fn1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> filename
</li>
<li>
support for arbitrary message flags <a id="fnref2" href="#fn2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
</li>
<li>
a simple and standardized directory structure
</li>
<li>
a customizable, human-centric part of the filename
</li>
</ol>
<p>I think the first two are pretty self-explanatory.</p>
<p>About the third one, I’ll just say: if some mail is in a folder
<code>INBOX/subfolder</code>, then the file is in <code>$MAIL/INBOX/subfolder</code>. There is no
<code>cur</code> or <code>new</code>, no <code>.INBOX.subfolder</code>, or any such shenanigans. Plain and
simple, and much more strict about it <a id="fnref3" href="#fn3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>What I am most excited about, though, is number four. The spec only dictates
that each filename must end a certain way. Since it can be parsed from the end,
the beginning of the filename is up to the application, and by extension to the
user. The spec provides an example, which I will also use here for
illustration. A user might choose a naming scheme such that they may end up
with the following filename:</p>
<p><code>2023-09-04_13:47_builds@sr.ht:GTfrlwJfN5vyR28R</code></p>
<p>For any spec-compliant application, only the part <code>:GTfrlwJfN5vyR28R</code> is
relevant - that’s the message’s unique ID. In fact, the spec even <em>forbids</em>
applications from attempting to parse the other part. That part is called the
<em>human-centric</em> part of the filename. It is - in this example - chosen to be a
representation of the messages <code>Date</code> and <code>From</code> headers.</p>
<p>Note that this is merely a <em>subjective</em> example. So, what value would such a
naming scheme provide (for me)? First and foremost, lexicographical ordering,
which many tools readily provide (<code>ls</code>, <code>| sort</code>, etc.) also establishes
<em>chronological</em> order, which matches <em>my</em> mental model of my mails. In
combination with the “from” address, I am confident that, given a moderate
amount of file names, I could pin-point the one I am looking for just from the
filename.</p>
<p>An example use case might be grepping through all mails. Imagine it returns
20-30 matches, and the filenames provide enough context that you can spot the
one you’re after. How nice would that be?</p>
<p>Or how about cleaning up? Deleting (or moving) all mails from the previous
year would just be a simple shell glob away. The same could be true for
restoring backups, for example.</p>
<p>I mean, I know very few people get excited about using dusty CLI tools on their
mails, but given that there is no reason <em>not to</em>, why not at least make it
possible?</p>
<p>And again, this is just an example of how <em>I</em> would like it. The spec lets you
go crazy. Prefer the time with seconds? No problem. Fancy your dates in roman
numerals? Be my (weird) guest. More seriously, of course, you might live
someplace that uses a different calendar, doesn’t use Arabic numerals, or maybe
you just don’t want any date in the filename at all. The spec has you covered,
by not covering this part.</p>
</section>
<section id="Now-what">
<h2>Now what?</h2>
<p>“Cool”, you might think, “where do I sign up?”. Well…</p>
<p>There is work ongoing, but frankly, nothing is done yet. In fact, I wanted to
get this out now, because maybe someone out there has some really valuable
feedback that should be incorporated before I declare the spec done. So if you
find this interesting, have questions or comments, why not reach out to the
<a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~bitfehler/m2dir">mailing list</a>?</p>
<p>Just to set expectations, though: drastic changes are very unlikely. This has
been through quite some iterations, and many things are now the way they are
for pretty good reasons. But any arguments may still be worth having, so if in
doubt, I’d like to hear from you!</p>
<p>That of course also means: if you think this might be something you’d like to
implement in a project you maintain, there is probably not much harm in
starting with some prototype - any potential changes <em>should</em> be minor. And of
course, let me know about it!</p>
<p>So, there, I did it. I’d like to thank Drew and Simon for their very early
feedback, which tremendously helped me finding the right direction, and Knut
for his enthusiasm, which helped me to finally kick this out the door!</p>
