<p>The company started in 1969 as a subsidiary of Golden United Life Insurance. It was initially a computer time-sharing service. It offered data processing power to businesses that didn't have their own mainframe computers.</p><p>Rich Baker started working in the marketing department for CompuServe in 1976 and was director of corporate communications when he left in 1996. (Baker is currently a co-host on WOSU's <a href="https://www.wosu.org/show/bluegrass-ramble" data-cms-ai="0">Bluegrass Ramble</a>.)</p><p>"They were giant computers. They'd be like having 10 refrigerators stacked next to each other," Baker said. "It had flashing lights. They had spinning tape reels." </p><p>Baker said the company’s data processing business was doing very well in the late 1970's.</p><p>"It was serving some of the largest corporations in the country. But, you know, we still had those large mainframe computers that sat relatively idle in the evenings," Baker said.</p><p>So CompuServe tested the idea of giving that access to tech enthusiasts who were using these new devices called microcomputers. That developed into a business plan.</p><div data-align-center="">

<p>On September 24, 1979, CompuServe launched its online service for consumers. </p><p>In the beginning, RadioShack stores were key in reaching early computer users.  Their TRS-80 desktop microcomputer was a popular choice when home computers first became available.</p><p>RadioShack marketed MicroNet, later rebranded CompuServe Information Service, alongside new computers and modems. In 1980, H&amp;R Block acquired the company.</p><p>Former tech journalist Dylan Tweney covered the industry for decades and was an early Compuserve user. He still remembers his first email address, 72241.443@compuserve.com. He also remembers the first email he sent.</p><p>"I sent an email to my dad," Tweney said. His father, who was a professor at a university, had email access relatively early. "I was so proud," he said.</p><p>In those days, users would sit at their computers and dial a phone number with their modems, sometimes placing an actual phone receiver onto the device.</p><p>"The modem would make this hellacious noise. It would kind of screech and squawk," Tweney said.</p><p>Once the connection was made, users would see the CompuServe menu.</p><p>"You'd be online and on your computer screen was a bunch of text," Tweney said. "So you'd get a menu of options that would appear as green text on your black monitor and you would type commands or press numbers to indicate which menu item you wanted."</p><p>Those options included email, weather maps, stock quotes, online shopping and even booking airline tickets.</p><p>The speed was slow—about 30 or 40 million times slower than what we’re used to today. But for the first time, users could read the newspaper online. In fact, <i>The Columbus Dispatch</i> was the first online newspaper. The Associated Press and other major newspapers soon followed.</p><p>Tweney said that while those features were impressive, CompuServe learned quickly that what computer users really wanted was<i> </i>human connection.</p><p>"But it turned out that what was most popular is not reading reliable news sources, but just shooting the breeze with your friends or arguing with strangers over politics," Tweney said.&nbsp;</p><p>On CompuServe, this took place on something called the CB Simulator. It was basically an online chat. The name, “CB”, referred to the CB radios that gained popularity in the 70s.</p><div data-align-center="">

<p>Will Cowman started using CompuServe as a teenager and later went to work for the company. He said he would often use up his weekly allowance for an hour of time online, which cost $5 an hour. </p><p>Cowman said he enjoyed playing CompuServe's interactive text-based adventure games, but it was the CB Simulator that really grabbed him.</p><p><b>"</b>I was very intrigued by my ability to communicate with people all around the world who didn't make any judgments about the fact that I was 14," Cowman said.</p><p>CompuServe also had popular forums that were divided into various areas of interest, everything from needlepoint to NASA. Cowman said that there were thousands of these forums.</p><p>"These communities I connected to were really supportive and really interesting," Cowman said. "People were very eager to help out and share and expand their online community."</p><p>CompuServe remained competitive with the other big online services, such as Prodigy and AOL, through the mid-1990s. However, none of these services were able to fully adapt to the huge shift that came with the internet and the World Wide Web, which was a wilder place where anyone could create their own website.</p><p>AOL acquired the CompuServe service in 1997 from H&amp;R Block. After that, remnants of the brand would survive for many years, but its heyday had passed.</p><p>According to Dylan Tweney, CompuServe should be remembered as a pioneer of digital community.</p><p>"For a lot of people, CompuServe was a connection to the world and their first introduction to the idea that their computer could be more than a computer. It was a communications device, an information device,” Tweney said.</p><p><i>Thanks to Chris Marshall for submitting this question to </i><a href="https://www.wosu.org/curious-cbus" data-cms-ai="0"><i>Curious Cbus</i></a><i>.

<p dir="auto">Winamp is a multimedia player launched in 1997, iconic for its flexibility and wide compatibility with audio formats. Originally developed by Nullsoft, it gained massive popularity with still millions of users. Its development slowed down, but now, its source code was opened to the community, allowing developers to improve and modernize the playerto meet current user needs.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Building of the Winamp desktop client is current based around Visual Studio 2019 (VS2019) and Intel IPP libs (You need to use exactly v6.1.1.035).
There are different options of how to build Winamp:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Use a build_winampAll_2019.cmd script file that makes 4 versions x86/x64 (Debug and Release). In this case Visual Studio IDE not running.</li>
<li>Use a winampAll_2019.sln file to build and debug in Visual Studio IDE.</li>

<p><a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/halide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halide</a> may have been featured during the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/iphone-16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iPhone 16</a> keynote, but it seems that wasn’t enough to protect it from an over-zealous App Store reviewer. <a href="https://www.lux.camera/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lux</a> co-founder Ben Sandofsky shared that the latest version of Halide was rejected from <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">App Store</a> …</p>



<p>The reason? Because it seemingly wasn’t clear why a camera app needs access to the camera in order to take photos.</p>



<p>When you run Halide, the app of course requests access to the camera. Developers are required to explain why they require access to features like this, and Lux’s explanation seems reasonably clear:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The camera will be used to take photographs</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But it appears that Apple decided that wasn’t sufficiently clear, as <a href="https://mastodon.social/@sandofsky/113181384256449181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sandofsky explained</a> on Mastodon.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The latest Halide update was rejected because, after seven years, a random reviewer decided our permission prompt wasn’t descriptive enough.</p>



<p>I don’t know how to explain why a camera app needs camera permissions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em><a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2466517/app-store-review-is-still-broken.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Macworld’s</a></em> Macolope suggested clearer, if less grammatical, text:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The camera will be used to take photographs for the app that you just downloaded to take photographs for.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Halide is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/09/16/halide-gets-camera-control-support-also-available-from-lock-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the apps to support</a> the new <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/09/19/familiarize-yourself-with-the-camera-control-button-before-your-iphone-16-arrives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Camera Control button</a> on the iPhone 16.</p>

    <h3><i>Almost</i>-Rans</h3>
    <p>
        Maybe it’s the change of weather. Fall often finds me looking backward, to the past —&nbsp;and anyway it is as 
        good excuse as any as to why I have found myself peering into old hard drives trying to recover old bits and bytes from games that 
        I wrote some thirty-five years ago or so. 
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
        Shareware games that I released all those years ago I gathered onto a disk image and posted to GitHub as 
        <a href="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/SoftDorothy-SharewareProjects">Soft Dorothy Software — Early Shareware Projects</a>. 
        I wrote about the sometimes extraordinary work I needed to employ in order to recover some of these in 
        <a href="https://engineersneedart.com/blog/shareware/shareware.html">a blog post</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The disk image is the kind you can drag to a 68K or PPC Mac emulator such as <a href="https://basilisk.cebix.net/">Basilisk II</a>, 
            <a href="https://sheepshaver.cebix.net/">Sheepshaver</a> or <a href="https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/">MiniVMac</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I followed up the shareware disk image with a disk image of <a href="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/SoftDorothy-CasadyGreeneProjects">Casady &amp; Greene Projects</a>. 
            Casady &amp; Greene was the name of the company that published my <b>Glider 4.0</b> game back in 1991 and so the sources and build tools 
            used to create <b>Glider 4.0</b> are on that disk image.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        The thing that I enjoyed the most about this trip down memory lane was rediscovering and revisiting the <i>almost-rans</i>. 
        While the paper airplane game I released is what people might know, there were plenty of game experiments that never even 
        made it beyond the <i>Hello World</i> stage —&nbsp;for various reasons. What I rediscovered on the old hard drives were many of 
        those early experiments. In trying to recover them, get them to compile again, I was reminded that there are so many 
        indefinable things that go into making a <i>good</i> game. Some of these abandoned experiments may in fact have been gems 
        in the rough had I spent a little more time trying to facet them, polish them. Or maybe not.

        I was really excited to also find a document that I had created in 1991 or so listing the games and “creator codes” that I 
        had used in these games. <i>Creator codes</i> were like a very crude “bundle identifier” back in the pre-OS-X era of the 
        Macintosh. They were supposed to be unique from all other application creator codes. The document is interesting to me today 
        because in it I had cataloged the projects that I had worked on up to that point.
    </p>
    <p>
        What follows is the list I created containing a creator code followed by the name and then the state of the game:
    </p>
    <figure>
		<img width="524" src="https://engineersneedart.com/blog/movefast/creator_codes.jpg" alt="List of creator codes.">
	</figure>
    <p>
        Out of twenty-seven titles, five of them I released (highlighted above). What were the other applications? Quick prototypes. And these 
        represent the projects over about an eighteen-month period. <i>(At the time I created this list I was apparently “working on” 
        three titles.)</i>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        I guess to be precise, I did release <i>UnMask</i> —&nbsp;a utility I spent ten minutes writing. I would dismiss it from the data though.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        I was very prolific during that time —&nbsp;staying up well past midnight coding every night. I also developed a kind of 
        “shell” for the type of sprite-based games that I was experimenting with so that the cost of a new “sketch”, a prototype 
        game, was primarily paid for in <b>MacPaint</b> —&nbsp;creating the sprites, artwork. A little code for unique input methods, 
        some game mechanics or physics would also be needed. Sounds, high scores, saved games —&nbsp;these are the things we could 
        kick down the road, implement only for the deserving games.
    </p>

    <p>
        But I was developing a methodology of prototyping ideas quickly in order to determine (quickly) if an idea had legs —&nbsp;if 
        it stuck to the wall so to speak.
    </p>
    <h3>Prototype Things</h3>
    <p>
        Games are funny things. When I consider games that I liked, the reasons the game hooked me are often nuanced. I’m not sure 
        you can just set out and <i>make</i> a good game. Serendipity seems to plays a role. Or maybe it’s just that <i>I</i> have 
        found myself unable to just conjure up a great game the first go.
    </p>
    <p>
        Want to know if a kite-fighting game would be fun? Knock out enough of the game in a few days to where you can play with the 
        physics and control of the kite. If flying the kite is too difficult to master, probably no one is going to enjoy the game. 
        On the other hand if just flying the kite is fun, even without the combat element, you’re probably on to something.
    </p>
    <figure>
        <img width="512" src="https://engineersneedart.com/blog/movefast/K-10.png" alt="Another unfinished game, K-10.">
        <figcaption>
            Another racing game, <b>K-10</b> (Kansas highway 10) never moved beyond the prototype stage.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        Maybe you have played the arcade game, <b>Joust</b>. Even before enemies <i>rez in</i> it was fun just hitting the flap 
        button to fly —&nbsp;sometimes having to pace your flapping, sometimes flapping frenetically to climb quickly. Quite fun.
    </p>
    <p>
        I found that a simple game where a paper airplane in a cluttered house had to make use of floor vents to get lift was kind 
        of fun as well —&nbsp;even before you realize you should be making progress through the rooms and avoiding toast or whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
        But as I say, there’s only one way to find out if what you <i>thought</i> would be fun on paper is in fact fun.
    </p>
    <h3>Abandon Them</h3>
    <p>
        Some games make it out of the starting gate but then you find there’s nowhere to go with the game. In my list at the top 
        of this post I had brutally noted <b>&lt;no point&gt;</b> for some games. Like the platformer game I began, 
        <b>Thief of Baghdad</b>, where you could ride a magic carpet and leap about. That was kind of fun, but … then what?
    </p>
    <figure>
        <img width="512" src="https://engineersneedart.com/blog/movefast/Carpet.png" alt="Unfinished game, Thief of Baghdad.">
        <figcaption>
            <b>Thief of Baghdad</b> never got off the ground.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        Consider too that I was a solitary programmer. So some games seemed to have potential but it became clear very quickly 
        that I would need to invest a year or more to get the game to a finished state. I loved <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i> and 
        would have loved to write a sprite-based adventure game. But, man, when I consider all the sprite-work that would be 
        required for the player, wielding all the weapons they might wield, all the monsters and their moves, all the spell 
        effects, etc. Never mind coding all the spells, varied combat, etc.

    </figure>
    <h3>Not Really Dead</h3>
    <p>
        But this is not a case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem">The Marriage Problem</a>, you can 
        always go back and revisit a game you had previously shelved. <i>(Assuming you can still find the sources, resources, and 
        project files.)</i> I did revisit <b>Thief of Baghdad</b> eighteen or so months later (in color and renamed <b>Scheherazade</b>) 
        and it even started to get “a point”.
    </p>
    <figure>
        <img width="640" src="https://engineersneedart.com/blog/movefast/Scheherazade.jpg" alt="Unfinished game, <b>Scheherazade</b>.">
    </figure>
    <blockquote>
        Alas though, maybe you can’t go back after all —&nbsp;or perhaps <i>should</i> not. While I got further with the game in 
        its second incarnation, it never really attained that <i>indescribable something</i> and so was abandoned again.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Never mind that you can also <i>harvest</i> code from any of your shelved projects. I mean why rewrite the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle">Fisher–Yates shuffle algorithm</a> if you have it already 
        in a shelved game? Code for switching the monitor depth (on those early Macs) I moved from game to game… Polygon-point 
        collision code, a sine lookup-table for quick trig functions, a dot-product routine, cross-product routines…
    </p>
    <p>
        I never regarded these prototyping efforts as wasted ones.
    </p>
    <h3>Salaryman</h3>
    <p>
       The era of the indie Mac game developer felt to me like it was coming to a close as the 1990’s decade proceeded. In any 
       event when I was presented with a job offer to come out to California and work at Apple I eagerly took it —&nbsp;even though 
       I understood that from that point on I would not be allowed to work on non-Apple projects in my spare time.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Not strictly true —&nbsp;to code outside of work though you did have to get written permission from management. 
        I mean it’s part of that whole <i>non-compete</i> clause —&nbsp;tech companies having been burned throughout history 
        by employees creating  start-ups that eventually take over their business. Apple was not in the <i>games business</i> 
        so perhaps I would have gotten a pass. It’s that fear that: what if I ask for permission and they say no?
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Finding myself in a world of whiteboards and conference rooms made no difference —&nbsp;I found that I continued to take a 
        quick-prototyping approach to any project that landed on my desk (though, perhaps needless to say, the projects were no 
        longer games).
    </p>
    <p>
        Other programmers that I worked with (maybe I should call them <i>software engineers</i>) <i>designed</i> software. And they 
        made better use of the whiteboards than I did. Rather than iterate at compile-time like I was want to do, they would 
        instead carefully plan and design their software before ever typing a line of code —&nbsp;iterating I suppose on a whiteboard.
    </p>
    <figure>
        <img width="640" src="https://engineersneedart.com/blog/movefast/Ropter.jpg" alt="Unfinished game, ‘Ropter.">
        <figcaption>
            I wrote flight-sim code following a book and I soon had a steam-punk project … shelved (too much still to do).
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        From my approach of diving in rather than planning I began to regard myself at Apple as a “blue-collar” programmer 
        working among “white-collar” professionals (imposter syndrome maybe?). But to give myself some credit, after having 
        written code for seven years or so at this point, my instinct as to which direction to dive in with a task was at least 
        an informed one.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        There’s a guy on GitHub, his status is “I am typing on the keyboard to do the job.” Story of my life —&nbsp;I like it.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        No doubt though, often enough, this freewheeling approach might send me into the weeds. But with the speed at which I 
        pulled the code together, I often found the bottlenecks fairly quickly —&nbsp;quick enough that I could more or less start 
        the whole project over. If you find this narrator reliable, I will say that I often would start and then restart a project 
        perhaps three times and, when all was said and done, have the project in as good a state at about the same time that my 
        white-collar cohorts would have their more carefully designed code also running.
    </p>
    <p>
        So was the whole exercise of my guerilla programming technique a wash? Maybe. But it always served <i>me</i> well 
        (or was perhaps the only way I knew to program effectively). Often though my last code <i>revision</i> was in fact to 
        simplify the code —&nbsp;generally to make it easier to follow, easier to understand, easier to maintain. <i>(The insight on 
        how at last to organize the code having come out of treating the whole thing as wildly mutable from the beginning.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        There were times too when a coworker might have said, “You should have used a Bloom Filter” and I was able to come back with, 
        “Yeah, already tried that but the typical data we are seeing is so small that the performance gains were negligible and added 
        unnecessary complexity to the code base so I tossed it.” Boom!
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>(Okay, maybe something like that happened only once —&nbsp;but it was awesome when it did!)</i>
    </p>
    <h3>A.B.I.</h3>
    <p>
        By the time I finally retired I had slowly come around to feeling like I had in fact been a contributing employee at Apple. 
        To be clear, it was important to me to be a contributing <i>co-worker</i> really. The engineers on the teams that I worked 
        on were the highlight of working as a salaryman (no longer coding solo in a monitor-lit corner of the bedroom all night). 
        I worked with the smartest people I have ever come to know. There were people I worked with that were an order of magnitude 
        better programmer than I will ever be. And it was important to me to feel like I was helping too in my way.
    </p>
    <p>
        I think I did rank among the <i>fastest</i> programmers. <i>(Is that a category?)</i> You wanted something prototyped to show as a 
        demo for a meeting this week, I’ll have two versions for you then (one with and without a Bloom Filter, ha ha).
    </p>
    <p>
        And this bit is for my daughters. I have always told them growing up, “A. B. I.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “‘A’ — Always. ‘B’ — Be. ‘I’ — Iterating.”
    </p>
    <p>
        “Always Be Iterating.”
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            I put together disk images of these <i>games-that-never-were</i> —&nbsp;projects, sources, tools —&nbsp;and posted them to GitHub. 
            The pixel art of that early Macintosh era, especially the B&amp;W era, resonates with nostalgia for a lot of people. There might 
            too be a lesson to game devs in all the times that a game has <i>not</i> launched. For me, as I stated at the outset, 
            I assembled these relics for the memories —&nbsp;or maybe to close that chapter.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have posted the disk images I have assembled to date as 
            <a href="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/SoftDorothy-UnfinishedTales-Vol1">Soft Dorothy Software: Unfinished Tales (Vol. 1)</a> and 
            <a href="https://github.com/EngineersNeedArt/SoftDorothy-UnfinishedTales-Vol2">Soft Dorothy Software: Unfinished Tales (Vol. 2)</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            There will be a Volume 3. It’s a bit of work though to get each project in shape for “release” so I can’t promise when a  
            follow-on volume will appear.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <article>
  
  <time datetime="2024-09-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Sep 2024</time>
  <p><a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky</a> recently saw a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:q6gjnaw2blty4crticxkmujt/post/3l2zpatdkjx2f">massive spike</a> in activity in response to Brazil’s ban of Twitter.</p>

<p>As a result, the AT Proto event firehose provided by Bluesky’s Relay at <code>bsky.network</code> has increased in volume by a huge amount. The average event rate during this surge increased by ~1,300%.</p>

<p>Before this new surge in activity, the firehose would produce around 24 GB/day of traffic. After the surge, this volume jumped to over 232 GB/day!</p>

<p><img src="https://jazco.dev/public/images/2024-09-24/firehose_traffic.png" alt="Graph of firehose traffic vs a week prior"></p>

<p>Keeping up with the full, verified firehose quickly became less practical on cheap cloud infrastructure with metered bandwidth.</p>

<p>To help reduce the burden of operating bots, feed generators, labelers, and other non-verifying AT Proto services, I built <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/jetstream">Jetstream</a> as an alternative, lightweight, filterable JSON firehose for AT Proto.</p>

<h2 id="how-the-firehose-works">How the Firehose Works</h2>

<p>The AT Proto firehose is a mechanism used to keep verified, fully synced copies of the <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/data-repos">repos</a> of all users.</p>

<p>Since repos are represented as Merkle Search Trees, each firehose event contains an update to the user’s MST which includes all the changed blocks (nodes in the path from the root to the modified leaf). The root of this path is signed by the repo owner, and a consumer can keep their copy of the repo’s MST up-to-date by applying the diff in the event.</p>

<p>For a more in-depth explanation of how Merkle Trees are constructed, check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240901220955/https://www.baeldung.com/cs/merkle-trees">this explainer</a>.</p>

<p>Practically, this means that for every small JSON record added to a repo, we also send along some number of MST blocks (which are content-addressed hashes and thus very information-dense) that are mostly useful for consumers attempting to keep a fully synced, verified copy of the repo.</p>

<p>You can think of this as the difference between cloning a git repo v.s. just grabbing the latest version of the files without the <code>.git</code> folder. In this case, the firehose effectively streams the diffs for the repository with commits, signatures, and metadata, which is inherently heavier than a point-in-time checkout of the repo.</p>

<p>Because firehose events with repo updates are signed by the repo owner, they allow a consumer to process events from any operator without having to trust the messenger.</p>

<p>This is the “Authenticated” part of the Authenticated Transfer (AT) Protocol and is crucial to the correct functioning of the network.</p>

<p>That being said, of the hundreds of consumers of Bluesky’s production Relay, &gt;90% of them are building feeds, bots, and other tools that don’t keep full copies of the entire network and don’t verify MST operations at all.</p>

<p>For these consumers, all they actually process is the JSON records created, updated, and deleted in each event.</p>

<p>If consumers already trust the provider to do validation on their end, they could get by with a much more lightweight data stream.</p>

<h2 id="how-jetstream-works">How Jetstream Works</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/jetstream">Jetstream</a> is a streaming service that consumes an AT Proto <code>com.atproto.sync.subscribeRepos</code> <a href="https://atproto.com/specs/event-stream">stream</a> and converts it into lightweight, friendly JSON.</p>

<p>If you want to try it out yourself, you can connect to my public Jetstream instance and view all posts on Bluesky in realtime:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>websocat <span>"wss://jetstream.atproto.tools/subscribe?wantedCollections=app.bsky.feed.post"</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><em>Note: the above instance runs on a $5/mo VPS and is just run by me personally, official public Jetstream instances are coming soon</em></p>

<p>Jetstream converts the CBOR-encoded MST blocks produced by the AT Proto firehose and translates them into JSON objects that are easier to interface with using standard tooling available in programming languages.</p>

<p>Since Repo MSTs only contain records in their leaf nodes, this means Jetstream can drop all of the blocks in an event except for those of the leaf nodes, typically leaving only one block per event.</p>

<p>In reality, this means that Jetstream’s JSON firehose is nearly 1/10 the size of the full protocol firehose for the same events, but lacks the verifiability and signatures included in the protocol-level firehose.</p>

<p>Jetstream events end up looking something like:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>

  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Each event lets you know the DID of the repo it applies to, when it was seen by Jetstream (a time-based cursor), and up to one updated repo record as serialized JSON.</p>

<p>Check out this 10 second CPU profile of Jetstream serving 200k evt/sec to a local consumer:
<img src="https://jazco.dev/public/images/2024-09-24/no_comp_cpu.png" alt="pprof of Jetstream showing CPU without compression"></p>

<p>By dropping the MST and verification overhead by consuming from relay we trust, we’ve reduced the size of a firehose of all events on the network from 232 GB/day to ~41GB/day, but we can do better.</p>

<h3 id="jetstream-and-zstd">Jetstream and <code>zstd</code></h3>

<p>I recently read a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240921070907/https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-reduced-websocket-traffic-by-40-percent">great engineering blog</a> from Discord about their use of <code>zstd</code> to compress websocket traffic to/from their Gateway service and client applications.</p>

<p>Since Jetstream emits marshalled JSON through the websocket for developer-friendliness, I figured it might be a neat idea to see if we could get further bandwidth reduction by employing <code>zstd</code> to compress events we send to consumers.</p>

<p><code>zstd</code> has two basic operating modes, <a href="https://facebook.github.io/zstd/zstd_manual.html#Chapter3">“simple”</a> mode and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/zstd/zstd_manual.html#Chapter7">“streaming”</a> mode.</p>

<h4 id="streaming-compression">Streaming Compression</h4>

<p>At first glance, streaming mode seems like it’d be a great fit. We’ve got a websocket connection with a consumer and streaming mode allows the compression to get more efficient over the lifetime of the connection.</p>

<p>I went and implemented a streaming compression version of Jetstream where a consumer can request compression when connecting and will get <code>zstd</code> compressed JSON sent as binary messages over the socket instead of plaintext.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this had a massive impact on Jetstream’s server-side CPU utilization. We were effectively compressing every message once per consumer as part of their streaming session. This was not a scalable approach to offering compression on Jetstream.</p>

<p>Additionally, Jetstream stores a buffer of the past 24 hours (configurable) of events on disk in <a href="https://github.com/cockroachdb/pebble">PebbleDB</a> to allow consumers to replay events before getting transitioned into live-tailing mode.</p>

<p>Jetstream stores serialized JSON in the DB, so playback is just shuffling the bytes into the websocket without having to round-trip the data into a Go struct.</p>

<p>When we layer in streaming compression, playback becomes significantly more expensive because we have to compress outgoing events on-the-fly for a consumer that’s catching up.</p>

<p>In real numbers, this increased CPU usage of Jetstream by 23% while lowering the throughput of playback from ~200k evt/sec to ~28k evt/sec for a single local consumer.</p>

<p>When in streaming mode, we can’t leverage the bytes we compress for one consumer and reuse them for another consumer because <code>zstd</code>’s streaming context window may not be in sync between the two consumers. They haven’t received exactly the same data in the session so the clients on the other end don’t have their state machines in the same state.</p>

<p>Since streaming mode’s primary advantage is giving us eventually better efficiency as the encoder learns about the data, what if we just taught the encoder about the data at the start and compress each message statelessly?</p>

<h4 id="dictionary-mode">Dictionary Mode</h4>

<p><code>zstd</code> offers a mechanism for initializing an encoder/decoder with pre-optimized settings by providing a <a href="https://facebook.github.io/zstd/#small-data">dictionary</a> trained on a sample of the data you’ll be encoding/decoding.</p>

<p>Using this dictionary, <code>zstd</code> essentially uses it’s smallest encoded representations for the most frequently seen patterns in the sample data. In our case, where we’re compressing serialized JSON with a common event shape and lots of common property names, training a dictionary on a large number of real events should allow us to represent the common elements among messages in the smallest number of bytes.</p>

<p>For take two of Jetstream with <code>zstd</code>, let’s to use a single encoder for the whole service that utilizes a custom dictionary trained on 100,000 real events.</p>

<p>We can use this encoder to compress <em>every</em> event as we see it, before persisting and emitting it to consumers. Now we end up with two copies of every event, one that’s just serialized JSON, and one that’s statelessly compressed to <code>zstd</code> using our dictionary.</p>

<p>Any consumers that want compression can have a copy of the dictionary on their end to initialize a decoder, then when we broadcast the shared compressed event, all consumers can read it without any state or context issues.</p>

<p><em>This requires the consumers and server to have a pre-shared dictionary, which is a major drawback of this implementation but good enough for our purposes.</em></p>

<p>That leaves the problem of event playback for compression-enabled clients.</p>

<p>An easy solution here is to just store the compressed events as well!</p>

<p>Since we’re only sticking the JSON records into our PebbleDB, the actual size of the 24 hour playback window is &lt;8GB with sstable compression. If we store a copy of the JSON serialized event <em>and</em> a copy of the <code>zstd</code> compressed event, this will, at most, double our storage requirements.</p>

<p>Then during playback, if the consumer requests compression, we can just shuffle bytes out of the compressed version of the DB into their socket instead of having to move it through a <code>zstd</code> encoder.</p>

<h2 id="savings">Savings</h2>

<p>Running with a custom dictionary, I was able to get the average Jetstream event down from 482 bytes to just 211 bytes (~0.44 compression ratio).</p>

<p>Jetstream allows us to live tail all posts on Bluesky as they’re posted for as little as ~850 MB/day, and we could keep up with all events moving through the firehose during the Brazil Twitter Exodus weekend for 18GB/day (down from 232GB/day).</p>

<p>With this scheme, Jetstream is required to compress each event only once before persisting it to disk and emitting it to connected consumers.</p>

<p>The CPU impact of these changes is significant in proportion to Jetstream’s incredibly light load but it’s a flat cost we pay once no matter how many consumers we have.</p>

<p><img src="https://jazco.dev/public/images/2024-09-24/after_cpu.png" alt="Jetstream CPU pprof with compression"></p>

<p><em>(CPU profile from a 30 second pprof sample with 12 consumers live-tailing Jetstream)</em></p>

<p>Additionally, with Jetstream’s shared buffer broadcast architecture, we keep memory allocations incredibly low and the cost per consumer on CPU and RAM is trivial. In the allocation profile below, more than 80% of the allocations are used to consume the full protocol firehose.</p>

<p><img src="https://jazco.dev/public/images/2024-09-24/after_allocations.png" alt="Jetstream allocation pprof with compression"></p>

<p>The total resident memory of Jetstream sits below 16MB, 25% of which is actually consumed by the new <code>zstd</code> dictionary.</p>

<p><img src="https://jazco.dev/public/images/2024-09-24/after_ram.png" alt="Jetstream in-use memory pprof with compression"></p>

<p>To bring it all home, here’s a screenshot from the dashboard of my public Jetstream instance serving 12 consumers all with various filters and compression settings, running on a $5/mo OVH VPS.</p>

<p><img src="https://jazco.dev/public/images/2024-09-24/jetstream_dash.png" alt="jetstream dashboard screenshot"></p>

<p>At our new baseline firehose activity, a consumer of the protocol-level firehose would require downloading ~3.16TB/mo to keep up.</p>

<p>A Jetstream consumer getting all created, updated, and deleted records without compression enabled would require downloading ~400GB/mo to keep up.</p>

<p>A Jetstream consumer that only cares about posts and has <code>zstd</code> compression enabled can get by on as little as ~25.5GB/mo, &lt;99% of the full weight firehose.</p>

<p>Feel free to join the conversation about Jetstream and <code>zstd</code> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:q6gjnaw2blty4crticxkmujt/post/3l4rlbynavw2y">on Bluesky</a>.</p>

						<p>Note that the code on this site is not David Braben's original source code, as that hasn't been released. Instead, it is a fully buildable source that's been lovingly reconstructed from a disassembly of the original game binaries, and which produces 100% identical game files. All of the variable and routine names are my own invention, but the code itself matches the original source.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="3D-Stacked CMOS Takes Moore’s Law to New Heights"><p><strong>Perhaps the most</strong> far-reaching technological achievement over the last 50 years has been the steady <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/a-better-way-to-measure-progress-in-semiconductors" target="_self">march toward ever smaller transistors</a>, fitting them more tightly together, and reducing their power consumption. And yet, ever since the two of us started our <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/careers/">careers</a> at <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/intel">Intel</a> more than 20 years ago, we’ve been hearing the alarms that the descent into the infinitesimal was about to end. Yet year after year, brilliant new innovations continue to propel the semiconductor industry further.
</p><p>
	Along this journey, we engineers had to change the transistor’s architecture as we continued to scale down area and power consumption while boosting performance. The “planar” <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/transistor">transistor</a> designs that took us through the last half of the 20th century gave way to 3D fin-shaped devices by the first half of the 2010s. Now, these too have an end date in sight, with a new gate-all-around (GAA) structure rolling into production soon. But we have to look even further ahead because our ability to scale down even this new transistor architecture, which we call RibbonFET, has its limits.
</p><hr><p>
	So where will we turn for future scaling? We will continue to look to the third dimension. We’ve created experimental devices that stack atop each other, delivering logic that is 30 to 50 percent smaller. Crucially, the top and bottom devices are of the two complementary types, NMOS and PMOS, that are the foundation of all the logic circuits of the last several decades. We believe this 3D-stacked complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS), or CFET (complementary field-effect transistor), will be the key to extending Moore’s Law into the next decade.
</p><h2>The Evolution of the Transistor </h2><p><strong>Continuous innovation is an essential underpinning of Moore’s Law</strong>, but each improvement comes with trade-offs. To understand these trade-offs and how they’re leading us inevitably toward 3D-stacked CMOS, you need a bit of background on transistor operation.
</p><p>
	Every metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor, or MOSFET, has the same set of basic parts: the gate stack, the channel region, the source, and the drain. The source and drain are chemically doped to make them both either rich in mobile electrons (
	<em>n</em>-type) or deficient in them (<em>p</em>-type). The channel region has the opposite doping to the source and drain.
</p><div id="rebelltitem19" data-id="19" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-cmos/particle-19" data-basename="particle-19" data-post-id="2657807330" data-published-at="1669929004" data-use-pagination="False"><p>In the planar version in use in advanced microprocessors up to 2011, the MOSFET’s gate stack is situated just above the channel region and is designed to project an electric field into the channel region. Applying a large enough voltage to the gate (relative to the source) creates a layer of mobile charge carriers in the channel region that allows current to flow between the source and drain.</p><p>As we scaled down the classic planar transistors, what device physicists call short-channel effects took center stage. Basically, the distance between the source and drain became so small that current would leak across the channel when it wasn’t supposed to, because the gate electrode struggled to deplete the channel of charge carriers. To address this, the industry moved to an entirely different transistor architecture called a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-the-father-of-finfets-helped-save-moores-law" target="_self">FinFET</a>. It wrapped the gate around the channel on three sides to provide better electrostatic control.</p></div><p><img id="e1679" data-rm-shortcode-id="19f1ce24c1d6d33cec903b159c775a2f" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/blocks-of-grey-silver-and-black-with-a-stripe-of-gold-dots-on-one-and-a-fin-shaped-structure-of-gold-dots-on-the-other.jpg?id=30541824&amp;width=980" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/blocks-of-grey-silver-and-black-with-a-stripe-of-gold-dots-on-one-and-a-fin-shaped-structure-of-gold-dots-on-the-other.jpg?id=30541824&amp;width=980" width="1300" height="1300" alt="Blocks of grey, silver, and black with a stripe of gold dots on one and a fin-shaped structure of gold dots on the other."></p><div id="rebelltitem4" data-id="4" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-cmos/particle-4" data-basename="particle-4" data-post-id="2657807330" data-published-at="1669927851" data-use-pagination="False"><p><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/intels-new-transistors-enter-the-third-dimension" target="_self">Intel introduced its FinFETs</a> in 2011, at the 22-nanometer node, with the third-generation Core processor, and the device architecture has been the workhorse of Moore’s Law ever since. With FinFETs, we could operate at a lower voltage and still have less leakage, reducing power consumption by some 50 percent at the same performance level as the previous-generation planar architecture. FinFETs also switched faster, boosting performance by 37 percent. And because conduction occurs on both vertical sides of the “fin,” the device can drive more current through a given area of silicon than can a planar device, which only conducts along one surface.</p><p>However, we did lose something in moving to FinFETs. In planar devices, the width of a transistor was defined by lithography, and therefore it is a highly flexible parameter. But in FinFETs, the transistor width comes in the form of discrete increments—adding one fin at a time–a characteristic often referred to as fin quantization. As flexible as the FinFET may be, fin quantization remains a significant design constraint. The design rules around it and the desire to add more fins to boost performance increase the overall area of logic cells and complicate the stack of interconnects that turn individual transistors into complete logic circuits. It also increases the transistor’s capacitance, thereby sapping some of its switching speed. So, while the FinFET has served us well as the industry’s workhorse, a new, more refined approach is needed. And it’s that approach that led us to the 3D transistors we’re introducing soon.</p></div><div id="rebelltitem6" data-id="6" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-cmos/particle-6" data-basename="particle-6" data-post-id="2657807330" data-published-at="1669927940" data-use-pagination="False"><p>This advance, the RibbonFET, is our first new transistor architecture since the FinFET’s debut 11 years ago. In it, the gate fully surrounds the channel, providing even tighter control of charge carriers within channels that are now formed by nanometer-scale ribbons of silicon. With these nanoribbons (also called <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-nanosheet-transistor-is-the-next-and-maybe-last-step-in-moores-law" target="_self">nanosheets)</a>, we can again vary the width of a transistor as needed using lithography.</p><p>With the quantization constraint removed, we can produce the appropriately sized width for the application. That lets us balance power, performance, and cost. What’s more, with the ribbons stacked and operating in parallel, the device can drive more current, boosting performance without increasing the area of the device.<br></p><p>We see RibbonFETs as the best option for higher performance at reasonable power, and we will be introducing them in 2024 along with other innovations, such as PowerVia, our version of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/next-gen-chips-will-be-powered-from-below" target="_self">backside power delivery</a>, with the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/intel">Intel</a> 20A fabrication process.</p></div><div id="rebelltitem7" data-id="7" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-cmos/particle-7" data-basename="particle-7" data-post-id="2657807330" data-published-at="1669928096" data-use-pagination="False"><h2>Stacked CMOS</h2><p>One commonality of planar, FinFET, and RibbonFET transistors is that they all use CMOS technology, which, as mentioned, consists of <em>n</em>-type (NMOS) and <em>p</em>-type (PMOS) transistors. CMOS logic became mainstream in the 1980s because it draws significantly less current than do the alternative technologies, notably NMOS-only circuits. Less current also led to greater operating frequencies and higher transistor densities.</p><p>To date, all CMOS technologies place the standard NMOS and PMOS transistor pair side by side. But in a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8993462/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">keynote</a> at the <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/8971803/proceeding" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM) in 2019</a>, we introduced the concept of a 3D-stacked transistor that places the NMOS transistor on top of the PMOS transistor. The following year, at IEDM 2020, we presented <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9372066" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the design for the first logic circuit using this 3D technique</a>, an inverter. Combined with appropriate interconnects, the 3D-stacked CMOS approach effectively cuts the inverter footprint in half, doubling the area density and further pushing the limits of Moore’s Law.</p></div><div id="rebelltitem9" data-id="9" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-cmos/particle-9" data-basename="particle-9" data-post-id="2657807330" data-published-at="1669928096" data-use-pagination="False"><p>Taking advantage of the potential benefits of 3D stacking means solving a number of process integration challenges, some of which will stretch the limits of CMOS fabrication.</p><p>We built the 3D-stacked CMOS inverter using what is known as a self-aligned process, in which both transistors are constructed in one manufacturing step. This means constructing both <em>n</em>-type and <em>p</em>-type sources and drains by epitaxy—crystal deposition—and adding different metal gates for the two transistors. By combining the source-drain and dual-metal-gate processes, we are able to create different conductive types of silicon nanoribbons (<em>p</em>-type and <em>n</em>-type) to make up the stacked CMOS transistor pairs. It also allows us to adjust the device’s threshold voltage—the voltage at which a transistor begins to switch—separately for the top and bottom nanoribbons.</p></div><p><img id="be20b" data-rm-shortcode-id="6b57a2642594eb748f7a1356e29d79ac" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/three-pairs-of-two-grey-rectangles-float-above-three-more-pairs-of-grey-rectangles-in-a-black-and-white-micrograph.png?id=30542655&amp;width=980" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/three-pairs-of-two-grey-rectangles-float-above-three-more-pairs-of-grey-rectangles-in-a-black-and-white-micrograph.png?id=30542655&amp;width=980" width="1498" height="1060" alt="Three pairs of two grey rectangles float above three more pairs of grey rectangles in a black-and-white micrograph."><small><p>In CMOS logic, NMOS and PMOS devices usually sit side by side on chips. An early prototype has NMOS devices stacked on top of PMOS devices, compressing circuit sizes.</p></small><small><p>Intel</p></small></p><p>How do we do all that? The self-aligned 3D CMOS fabrication begins with a silicon wafer. On this wafer, we deposit repeating layers of silicon and silicon germanium, a structure called a superlattice. We then use lithographic patterning to cut away parts of the superlattice and leave a finlike structure. The superlattice crystal provides a strong support structure for what comes later.</p><p>Next, we deposit a block of “dummy” polycrystalline silicon atop the part of the superlattice where the device gates will go, protecting them from the next step in the procedure. That step, called the vertically stacked dual source/drain process, grows phosphorous-doped silicon on both ends of the top nanoribbons (the future NMOS device) while also selectively growing boron-doped silicon germanium on the bottom nanoribbons (the future PMOS device). After this, we deposit dielectric around the sources and drains to electrically isolate them from one another. The latter step requires that we then polish the wafer down to perfect flatness.</p><p>Finally, we construct the gate. First, we remove that dummy gate we’d put in place earlier, exposing the silicon nanoribbons. We next etch away only the silicon germanium, releasing a stack of parallel silicon nanoribbons, which will be the channel regions of the transistors. We then coat the nanoribbons on all sides with a vanishingly thin layer of an insulator that has a high dielectric constant. The nanoribbon channels are so small and positioned in such a way that we can’t effectively dope them chemically as we would with a planar transistor. Instead, we use a property of the metal gates called the work function to impart the same effect. We surround the bottom nanoribbons with one metal to make a <em>p</em>-doped channel and the top ones with another to form an <em>n</em>-doped channel. Thus, the gate stacks are finished off and the two transistors are complete.</p><div id="rebelltitem14" data-id="14" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-cmos/particle-14" data-basename="particle-14" data-post-id="2657807330" data-published-at="1669928471" data-use-pagination="False"><p>The process might seem complex, but it’s better than the alternative—a technology called sequential 3D-stacked CMOS. With that method, the NMOS devices and the PMOS devices are built on separate wafers, the two are bonded, and the PMOS layer is transferred to the NMOS wafer. In comparison, the self-aligned 3D process takes fewer manufacturing steps and keeps a tighter rein on manufacturing cost, something we demonstrated in research and reported at IEDM 2019.<br></p><p>Importantly, the self-aligned method also circumvents the problem of misalignment that can occur when bonding two wafers. Still, sequential 3D stacking is being explored to facilitate integration of silicon with nonsilicon channel materials, such as germanium and III-V semiconductor materials. These approaches and materials may become relevant as we look to tightly integrate optoelectronics and other functions on a single chip.</p></div><div id="rebelltitem17" data-id="17" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-cmos/particle-17" data-basename="particle-17" data-post-id="2657807330" data-published-at="1669928814" data-use-pagination="False"><p>The new self-aligned CMOS process, and the 3D-stacked CMOS it creates, work well and appear to have substantial room for further miniaturization. At this early stage, that’s highly encouraging. Devices having a gate length of 75 nm demonstrated both the low leakage that comes with excellent device scalability and a high on-state current. Another promising sign: We’ve made wafers where the smallest distance between two sets of stacked devices is only <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9720633" target="_blank">55 nm</a>. While the device performance results we achieved are not records in and of themselves, they do compare well with individual nonstacked control devices built on the same wafer with the same processing.</p><p>In parallel with the process integration and experimental work, we have many ongoing theoretical, simulation, and design studies underway looking to provide insight into how best to use 3D CMOS. Through these, we’ve found some of the key considerations in the design of our transistors. Notably, we now know that we need to optimize the vertical spacing between the NMOS and PMOS—if it’s too short it will increase parasitic capacitance, and if it’s too long it will increase the resistance of the interconnects between the two devices. Either extreme results in slower circuits that consume more power.</p><p>Many design studies, such as one by <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9720577/" target="_blank">TEL Research Center America presented at IEDM 2021</a>, focus on providing all the necessary interconnects in the 3D CMOS’s limited space and doing so without significantly increasing the area of the logic cells they make up. The TEL research showed that there are many opportunities for innovation in finding the best interconnect options. That research also highlights that 3D-stacked CMOS will need to have interconnects both above and below the devices. This scheme, called <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/next-gen-chips-will-be-powered-from-below" target="_self">buried power rails</a>, takes the interconnects that provide power to logic cells but don’t carry data and removes them to the silicon below the transistors. Intel’s PowerVIA technology, which does just that and is scheduled for introduction in 2024, will therefore play a key role in making 3D-stacked CMOS a commercial reality.</p><h2>The Future of Moore’s Law</h2><p>With RibbonFETs and 3D CMOS, we have a clear path to extend Moore’s Law beyond 2024. In a <a href="https://large.stanford.edu/courses/2012/ph250/lee1/docs/Excepts_A_Conversation_with_Gordon_Moore.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2005 interview</a> in which he was asked to reflect on what became his law, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/gordon-moore">Gordon Moore</a> admitted to being “periodically amazed at how we’re able to make progress. Several times along the way, I thought we reached the end of the line, things taper off, and our creative engineers come up with ways around them.”</p><p>With the move to FinFETs, the ensuing optimizations, and now the development of RibbonFETs and eventually 3D-stacked CMOS, supported by the myriad packaging enhancements around them, we’d like to think Mr. Moore will be amazed yet again.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

I've worked for an electrical contractor and I've built countless solutions to crazy problems using EMT conduit, usually by welding which is difficult and dangerous because of the zinc galvanize. I no longer have access to a welder so I began to search "conduit fittings" which led me to Maker Pipe which is the coolest concept ever!</p> <p>
