<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-component="">
      <p>Imagine having never ridden a broom with the <em>chosen one</em> they call Harry Potter, or stumbled through a closet and into the mystical land of Narnia. For kids that discover the magic of reading through books like <em>Harry Potter</em> or <em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em>, reading is a gateway to otherworldly realms where your only limitation is your imagination. But, reading isn’t easy for everyone. It’s estimated that 1 in 10 people have some form of dyslexia, often undiagnosed. Children with dyslexia struggle with simple reading tasks like sounding out words, making it difficult for them to read.</p>
<p>To help young readers of all skill levels, we’re introducing Kermit, a child-friendly typeface created by the type design studio <span><a href="https://underware.nl/">Underware</a></span>. Kermit is a friendly and approachable font that encourages children of all skill levels to read, even if they are anxious about their abilities. It is a powerful example of just how much design decisions matter: Associating boldness and letter widths with verbal inflections could improve a child’s comprehension, or employing Variable Fonts for animation may help severe dyslexics start their reading journey. Combining science and design creativity can improve a child’s confidence in reading, changing their trajectory in life. Kermit is, therefore, more than just a typeface, it is a platform for exploring new, science-based methods of helping children read.</p>
<p>Learning to read is difficult: the process involves nearly every part of your brain, and you have to train for years to do it effortlessly. For some people, though, reading can be like navigating a confusing highway filled with detours. Children who struggle to read often have low self-esteem and give up, limiting their creative potential and intellectual curiosity. Any help we can give children can be huge – even if it’s simply making words look more friendly.</p>
    </div><div data-block-component="">
      <h2>Designing for early readers</h2>
<p>Ever had your mood lifted, your burdens lightened, and your confidence boosted by someone’s encouraging words, or a stranger’s smile? We’ve all experienced that boost and science proves it. Being in a <a href="https://microsoft.design/articles/the-hidden-power-of-typography/">good mood</a> improves our performance on creative cognitive tasks.</p>
<p>For Underware designers Bas Jacobs, Akiem Helmling, and <span><a href="https://underware.nl/about_us/sami">Sami Kortemäki</a></span>, making Kermit fun and playful was a way to put kids in a good mood, making them interested in reading. Therefore, the design had to be informal and relatable like handwriting.</p>
    </div><div data-block-component="">
      <p>Kermit was designed for children to easily read, making legibility a priority. Underware imbued Kermit with a large x-height, thick strokes, generous spacing, and familiar letter shapes, striking a perfect balance between the informality of handwriting fonts and the structure and readability of classic book typefaces like Garamond or Avenir.</p>
<p>Making Kermit enjoyable—and with support for 426 languages based on Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic alphabets—is good but we wanted to do more by trying new ideas coming out of the scientific community. Take a look at the <span><a href="https://kermit-font.com/">online specimen site</a></span> for more details on Kermit’s design.</p>
<h2>Showing how to read expressively</h2>
<p>Remember when you were a kid having to clean your room, mow the lawn, or maybe take out the garbage? You probably heard your parent or guardian ask one of the following questions:</p>
<p>Did you take out the <strong>garbage</strong>?<br>
Did <strong>you</strong> take out the garbage?<br>
<strong>Did</strong> you take out the garbage?</p>
<p>All three questions use the same words, yet they have different meanings. When we speak, we inflect our voice to add more meaning. You might make your voice louder, or pronounce a word slowly, or raise your pitch. These inflections are called prosody. Unfortunately, almost all prosody gets lost when we write because we have no notation for it.</p>
<p>Ever had an email misunderstanding because people couldn’t tell you were being ironic? That confusion doesn’t happen as much in conversation because prosody makes the irony clear.</p>
<p>Researcher Ann Bessemans wondered if there was a way to represent prosody in written text. She <span><a href="https://journals.uc.edu/index.php/vl/article/view/4653">found</a></span> that when you represent pitch, volume, and duration typographically, children read out loud more expressively, with correct prosody. She also <a href="https://journals.uc.edu/index.php/vl/article/view/4603"><span>found</span></a> that it even worked for children and adults who had hearing impairments. Even better, a preliminary, yet unpublished study is finding that adding prosody to text improves children’s comprehension.</p>
<p>Inspired by the possibility of helping kids read expressively and improve their comprehension, we designed Kermit to represent prosody: employing boldness to represent volume, width to represent duration, and shifts letters vertically to represent pitch. It looks unconventional, but once you get used to it, it’s easy to read text and hear all the nuance that a performer would add.</p>
    </div><div data-block-component="">

    
    <p>Great oratory is very expressive. When we caption videos such as President John F. Kennedy’s inaugural speech using conventional text, all his passion is lost in translation. Adding prosody to the captions enables you to experience the full power of the performance—even if you have a hearing impairment and can’t hear a single word.</p>

    
  </div><div data-block-component="">
      <p>While we haven’t implemented automatic prosody yet, Kermit allows us to explore expressive writing to elevate comprehension for children and adults alike.</p>
<h2>Helping severe dyslexics</h2>
<p>Dyslexia is a very active area of research. Fifty years ago, people thought dyslexics saw letters backwards. Now, it’s primarily seen as a phonological problem in which dyslexics have difficulty with sounds in language. The most successful dyslexia programs to date focus on teaching phonemic awareness (e.g. that the spoken word “cat” has three sounds) and phonics (mapping letters to sounds). This success might make it seem like dyslexia is all about sounds, but it’s not clear yet if phonological problems are dyslexia’s <em>cause</em>.</p>
<p>In 2010, researchers Trichur Vidyasagar and Kristen Pammer suggested a new <a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/abstract/S1364-6613(09)00283-6">theory</a> on the cause of dyslexia: dyslexic brains might have issues with visuo-spatial processing. In other words, dyslexic brains may process visual information differently, making the order of letters unclear and reading difficult.</p>
<p>To understand this, let’s take a trip inside your brain. Light enters your eyes and shines on the retina. The retina processes the light, sending neural signals on a long journey from your eyes to the back of your head where your brain processes images, forwarding them through the visual cortex.</p>
<p>This journey takes two parallel paths: the high road and the low road, literally. The high road, or dorsal pathway, physically runs along the top path through your brain, carrying information about where things are, such as the sky is up, pavement is down, or the order of letters on a page. It is the “where” signal.</p>
<p>The low road, or ventral pathway, runs below the high road, carrying information about what objects are, e.g. the blue thing is the sky, the grey thing, pavement, and the two lines leaning against each other with a crossbar is an A. It is the “what” signal.</p>
<p>These two roads meet at a little neural town called the Visual Wordform Area, which combines the “what” and “where” signals to form words—hence the name. This is where we recognize words.</p>
<p>This neural town has a big spotlight in it, controlled partially by signals from the high road. As we read, the spotlight should smoothly move from one letter to the next, focusing our attention on a letter from the low road, identifying it, then moving to the next. If anything goes wrong along the high road—and there are many things that can go wrong—the spotlight will not move smoothly or focus attention as well, disrupting reading.</p>
<p>According to Vidyasagar &amp; Pammer’s theory, dyslexics may have something wrong in their high road, weakening signals about letter locations. That in turn makes it hard to understand the order that letters are coming in on the low road, making it more challenging to recognize words.</p>
<p>This smooth spotlight movement is something we have to learn. Before we learn to read, our eyes and attention unconsciously flit about, painting a picture of our world. The more we read, the more we train our brain to control our spotlight smoothly. But, if a child can’t recognize words due to weak high road signals, they won’t read as much. The neurological systems needed for proficient reading won’t get exercised, but they will get exercised in neurotypical classmates who read more. The dyslexic child gets left behind.</p>
<p>When these systems are underdeveloped, a child may not develop strong phonological associations or smooth visual scanning (remember, our eyes and brains have to be trained to do this; it isn’t natural). The number of potential issues along the high road might explain the variety of dyslexia subtypes.</p>
<p>So, what does all of this have to do with a font?</p>
<p>The high road doesn’t just carry location information; it carries motion signals, too. Adding motion to letters might boost the high road signal, helping dyslexics get control of their spotlight of attention and improve their reading. To help, we created a special version of Kermit that is animated, with letters that draw themselves.</p>
<h2>A font that draws itself</h2>
<p>How do you create an animated font?</p>
<p>Because Kermit is built as a Variable Font, it is not limited to Light, Regular, or Bold styles. It can produce any level of boldness thanks to Variable Font technology.</p>
    </div><div data-block-component="">
      <p>But the technology isn’t just for typography. It can vary in color, style, or even change a letter’s shape over time, making the font animated.</p>
<p>The math behind Variable Fonts, called linear interpolation, makes animation awkward because points on the letter’s outline must move in a straight line at a constant speed. Natural-looking animation through curves needs to use a higher order of mathematics.</p>
    </div><div data-block-component="">
      <p><em>An animation showing the advantage of HOI interpolation versus linear interpolation. Press play to show the animation or use the slider to control it yourself.</em></p>
<p>As a workaround, you could move points along many tiny lines so they seem to flow around a curve naturally. That, however, would require designers to draw dozens of versions of each letter like cartoon animators of the 1930’s–1970’s, painstakingly drawing 24 pictures for every second of film.</p>
<p>Luckily, Kermit’s designers had a clever mathematical idea: to combine independent linear parts of a Variable Font to create higher order math. They call it Higher Order Interpolation, or HOI for short. (Fun fact: In the Netherlands, where Underware is based, “Hoi” means “Hi”).</p>
<p>That breakthrough enabled the designers to create smooth animations that accelerate, decelerate, and turn corners with the control of an old school animator, without having to draw thousands of pictures. This makes Kermit’s animation feel like it’s naturally drawing itself with a pen.</p>
    </div><div data-block-component="">
      <p>An animation showing how Kermit can draw itself smoothly using HOI and variable font technologies. Press play to start the animation or use the slider to control it yourself.</p>
<p>We hope this animation will strengthen the high road signal in dyslexics, helping them better understand letter order and more easily recognize words. That could enable them to spend more time reading and training the neural pathways for reading. We are still testing this idea and will release the animated version only when we can scientifically prove its benefits.</p>
<h2>Empowering children</h2>
<p>Writing systems, which are over 5,500 years old, are one of humanity’s greatest inventions. Like magic or telepathy, they transmit ideas and creativity across the globe and across generations. It is one of the ways that we express our humanity. Now, it’s time for an upgrade. Time to take advantage of our latest technologies and research to empower more children to read.</p>
<p>In designing a child-centric font for reading, we hope to support children learning to read while also making it more enjoyable, valuable, and accessible for <em>everyone</em> to read. We explore new frontiers with the animated version of Kermit, new methods of research-based expressiveness, and new ways of making reading look fun and easy to all kids, regardless of reading skill.</p>
<p>The power of reading sets a child’s imagination on fire, and no movie or technology can surpass the theater of the mind. Reading gives children agency and, ultimately, confidence. It impacts the trajectory of their lives, from their academic performance across subjects, to future job prospects, to their self-image and whether or not they feel incompetent or capable. Every child deserves the opportunity to thrive, and we are dedicated to trying ideas new and old to help them. We hope that this first release of Kermit is the next step on that journey.</p>
<p>The basic styles of Kermit (Regular, Bold, Italic, and Bold Italic) are available today in Office, with the remaining 38 styles arriving in early May. <span data-teams="true">If you want to try out the font online in the meantime, you can go to the demo site at <a id="menur72k" title="https://kermit-font.com/" href="https://kermit-font.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Link Kermit-font.com"><span>Kermit-font.com</span></a>.</span></p>

            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              Between May 2023 and March 2025, Tract attempted to build a
              venture-backed company to address Britain’s housing crisis by
              improving the planning permission process. After raising a
              £744,000 pre-seed round in April 2024, we explored several
              business models: a site-sourcing tool for developers (Tract
              Source), a free land-appraisal tool for landowners (Attract),
              becoming tech-enabled land promoters ourselves, and finally, an
              AI-powered platform to assist with drafting planning documents
              (Tract Editor).
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite significant technical progress, building tools like Scout
              and the well-received Tract Editor, our journey taught us critical
              lessons from failing to secure a viable, venture-scale business
              model in the British property market. We learned the difficulty of
              selling software into a conservative sector, experienced the
              operational complexities and timelines of land promotion, and
              encountered a low willingness to pay for useful tools.
              Furthermore, we came to understand how the market's conservatism
              and fragmentation limited its potential for venture-backed
              disruption. After nearly two years without revenue or committed
              paying customers, we realised we lacked a clear path to the
              necessary scale and returns. This prompted the decision to cease
              operations and return capital, sharing our experience as a case
              study.
            </p>
            <p>
              In retrospect, it's easy to see ways we could have approached
              things differently. This document is a post mortem, explaining
              what happened and why it went wrong. Our aim in writing this is:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Codify and share what we’ve learned for our benefit and
                hopefully others.
              </li>
              <li>Document the story for posterity.</li>
              <li>
                Produce an artifact to explain, if not justify, the time and
                money spent.
              </li>
              <li>Exorcise our demons.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              We want to stress from the start that the ultimate failure of the
              company lies with us. Some issues were within our control and some
              were beyond it. At times, we’ll describe external factors in ways
              that sound negative. This isn’t an attempt to pass blame. We want
              to tell the story as matter-of-factly as possible. Most
              importantly, we’re extremely grateful to everyone who supported us
              over the last couple of years, in money and in time.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Housing in Britain is expensive because getting planning
                permission is difficult.
              </li>
              <li>
                Granting permission takes the median hectare of land from
                £20,000 to £2.4 million - a 139x uplift.
              </li>
              <li>
                If we can reduce the costs and uncertainty of this process by
                any reasonable amount, we can build a business and help solve
                the housing crisis.

              <p>
                Many young people have had to delay forming families and often
                take poorly paid, insecure jobs that can barely cover rent and
                living costs as the price for living in culturally attractive
                cities. They see opportunity as limited and growth as barely
                perceptible. Meanwhile, older generations sit on housing
                property worth many times what they paid and, stuck in a
                zero-sum mindset, often prioritise the protection of their own
                neighbourhoods over the need to build more homes. Can you blame
                young people who resent older people, and the West’s economic
                system itself, when this is what it offers them?

            <p>
              Housing in Britain is expensive because of artificial supply
              constraints - specifically, the difficulty of obtaining planning
              permission to build more. Planning permission is Britain’s
              regulatory approval that landowners must secure before developing
              land or changing a building's use. When permission is granted to
              build homes on agricultural land, its value increases dramatically
              (often 140x or more), creating enormous wealth for landowners.
            </p>

            <p>
              This looked like a business opportunity: if we could help more
              sites get planning permission, we could capture some of that
              uplift. The market size looked compelling - billions in Britain
              alone, the political winds seemed favourable, and there seemed to
              be few modern software solutions.
            </p>

            <p>
              We were driven by a mix of moral outrage and technological
              optimism. It seemed absurd that bureaucratic obstacles were
              holding back so much potential value, especially when millions
              were being spent on documentation that could be automated. With
              the rise of LLMs, we believed we could transform this inefficient
              process.

            <p>
              Strategic land teams are groups within property development
              companies responsible for identifying and acquiring land with
              long-term development potential. They focus on finding sites that
              don’t yet have permission for development but possess
              characteristics that suggest it could be obtained in the future.
              The earlier they can identify and secure control of these sites,
              the greater their competitive advantage and profit potential.
            </p>
            <p>
              This felt like a software-shaped problem and could form the basis
              of a larger platform for planning, moving elsewhere along the
              value chain. When Jamie began working on Tract, this site sourcing
              problem was the first thing he looked at.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some sourcing tools existed, but the popular options seemed poorly
              built: badly designed, built atop untrustworthy data sources, and
              not built around the sourcing workflow.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jamie had ideas to improve the product experience and began
              building them out. He started to lean on industry advisors for
              introductions. He read <em>The Mom Test</em> (more on which later)
              and had dozens of calls with whoever would take them.
            </p>
            <p>
              During these calls, he realised his intuitions about the existing
              products’ problems were correct (“I don’t trust it”, “I need to
              check the numbers, it’s annoying”). This was exciting: he thought
              he was onto something.
            </p>
            <p>
              But he didn’t ask why users tolerated it (“It’s fine”, “Does what
              I need”, “We went with [competitor] because, to be honest, they’re
              nice guys”). It was unlikely whatever he built could be 10-100x
              better at solving this problem without radically changing their
              workflow, which was tough for a solo developer working on savings

              Jamie also began to find <em>more</em> competitors, some
              well-resourced, all of whom appeared to be competing on price.
              These were already cheap contracts: a few hundred pounds per month
              for a small/medium-sized team. And they were getting cheaper.
            </p>
            <p>
              We concluded that this was a difficult market to sell into, with
              race-to-the-bottom pricing dynamics, and no obvious way to make a
              SaaS tool that helped strategic land teams do site selection so
              well that these factors wouldn’t matter. It was time to pivot.

              However, it took <strong>too long</strong> to reach the pivot
              point. A more thorough competitor analysis would have revealed the
              market problems earlier, rather than being distracted by writing
              code. None of what we needed to learn required writing code to get

              Interlude: Attract (October 2023 - November 2023)
            </h3>
            <p>
              Our site appraisal tool, Attract, emerged from discussions with
              our design partner Paul and from Tract Source's challenges. The
              concept was simple but promising: instead of selling land
              information to developers, we’d provide it to landowners for free.
              The greatest constraint for any promoter or developer is access to
              developable land, so we imagined a tool encouraging landowners to
              reveal their openness to development would be valuable. The
              generated appraisals would allow us to rapidly qualify sites and
              identify potential opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Initially, we considered selling this tool to developers and land
              promoters seeking strategic land opportunities. However, we
              quickly recognised two fatal flaws in this approach:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The economics didn't work—we couldn't charge more than
                £50/month/customer, and there weren’t many customers.
              </li>
              <li>
                We'd face the same sales challenges as Tract Source, compounded
                by the fact that this was an unconventional solution with no
                market precedents.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Despite this, Jamie completed the conversion work and launched a
              white-labelled version on Paul’s company’s website in early
              November. It delivered impressive results: he received more
              submissions and higher-quality leads. This quick win validated our
              technical approach, but the underlying business model remained
              insufficient to build our company.
            </p>
            <p>
              This experience taught us something valuable: we could create
              genuinely useful tools that solved real problems. However, we
              still hadn't cracked how to transform that utility into a
              venture-scale business model.
            </p>

              November 2023 - January 2024
            </h3>
            <p>
              With the white-labelled version of Attract online, we entered a
              period of exploration and uncertainty. We had a call with a major
              surveyor where we showed them a mocked-up tool for writing a
              planning application using an LLM and the information about a site
              in our database. But after the demo, we were ghosted.
            </p>
            <p>
              Market concerns loomed large. The pricing dynamics made us
              question our ability to raise capital with our current approach.
              In retrospect, we may have been closer to viable products than we
              realised. Multiple British prop-tech companies have been funded,
              including in the US, during the lifetime, suggesting alternative
              paths we could have taken.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite challenges, we continued experimenting. In December, we
              created a ‘Tinder for Buildings’ demo with inpainting models that
              received positive feedback. We continued scoping ways to build a
              business on our planning data work. We were awarded an
              <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/02/emergent-ventures-winners-32nd-cohort.html" target="_blank">Emergent Ventures grant</a>, validating our mission if not our approach.

            <h3 id="timeline-jan-2024-may-2024">January 2024 - May 2024</h3>
            <p>
              In January, we began fundraising while working on extracting Local
              Planning Authority validation checklists—technical work to support
              our evolving vision.
            </p>
            <p>
              A February visit to a developer proved illuminating, though not as
              hoped. Their skeptical in-house planner admitted: "To be honest,
              the system being broken helps us." This comment crystallised a
              tension in our market: many established players benefited from the
              inefficiencies we aimed to solve.
            </p>
            <p>
              This realisation prompted us to revisit our fundamental problem
              statement. The facts were compelling: land with planning
              permission becomes dramatically more valuable, and this value
              creation stems from the friction and uncertainty in the planning
              process—friction that good software could reduce.
            </p>
            <p>
              We faced a dilemma. Selling software into this market would be
              tough, and it seemed wasteful to capture only a small slice of the
              value we could create. If we could facilitate 100x value increases
              in land, why sell this capability to others for modest SaaS fees?
              What B2B model could compete with capturing that uplift directly?
            </p>
            <p>
              We considered a radical pivot: becoming land promoters ourselves.
              We’d partner with landowners or acquire land, secure planning
              permission using our technology, and sell with permission
              granted—capturing the value uplift directly.
            </p>
            <p>
              We found another opportunity: promotion costs don't scale linearly
              with site size, making many smaller sites economically unviable
              for traditional promoters. We could counterposition by targeting
              these ignored sites and sell them to SME developers.
            </p>
            <p>This model offered significant advantages:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>We avoided selling software to a resistant market.</li>
              <li>
                The potential revenue and profit margins were substantial,
                especially if we could reduce costs through automation.
              </li>
              <li>
                We had a clear technological roadmap: automate the existing site
                selection and planning application processes.
              </li>
              <li>
                As our own customer, we could optimise an industry that
                underutilised modern technology.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Implementation would be challenging—some aspects like site visits
              couldn't be fully automated—but we believed we could create a
              durable advantage by controlling the critical fulcrum point where
              planning permission is granted.
            </p>
            <p>This became our fundraising narrative:</p>

              </a>
            </figure>

            <p>
              During the fundraising process however, we identified a
              bottleneck: access to land. Without reliable land access, our
              growth would be constrained. How would we:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>put ourselves in front of landowners,</li>
              <li>identify the ones open to selling,</li>
              <li>get them over the line?</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              One investor – who ultimately passed – described this challenge as
              requiring extensive "hand-cranking"—an apt analogy. But at the
              time, we thought Attract could solve our top of funnel problem.
            </p>

            <p>
              Rather than white-labelling the tool for strategic land teams, we
              could own it, market aggressively to landowners, keep the sites we
              want to develop ourselves and pass the rest to strategic land
              teams for a referral fee. Appraising land and advising on its
              development potential is part of what a land agent does. We would
              be automating that.
            </p>

            <p>
              Why would a landowner use our tool? Partly out of curiosity like
              taking personality quizzes, but also because our information was
              genuinely useful. Land agents bill hundreds of pounds for
              appraisals with the same information we could pull
              programmatically. Henry had recently commissioned two appraisals
              for sites following advice his family had received. They were £600
              each and contained:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                A summary of planning constraints for the site (e.g.
                conservation areas, nearby listed buildings, where the village
                sat in the settlement hierarchy).
              </li>
              <li>
                Relevant local plan policies (e.g. what development to
                encourage/discourage).
              </li>
              <li>Previous planning applications for the site.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              We already had this information or plans to collect it. We could
              generate these appraisals, give them to landowners for free, and
              use this to solve the top-of-the-funnel problem.
            </p>

            <p>
              We made a subtle but critical error here - we assumed the problem
              was limited to the top of our funnel (identifying landowners and
              sites). In reality, as we'd discover, no part of the funnel was
              robust enough to build a venture-scale business in our required
              timeframe.
            </p>

            <p>
              Had we recognised this earlier, we might have concluded this
              business lacked venture-scale potential, or we could have examined
              how to modify our approach.

            <p>
              We still agree with the principle behind this pivot; that the next
              generation of billion-dollar companies may
              <a href="https://www.sarahtavel.com/p/ai-startups-sell-work-not-software" target="_blank">sell work</a>, not just software, and that this is especially true in UK
              proptech. We’re happy with the reasoning. But we were entering an
              industry to do something we had no experience in, and without any
              commercial traction.
            </p>
            <p>
              Paul Graham has an essay where he says the most efficient question
              to ask founders is “What have you learnt from users?”. One problem
              this question would have exposed if we’d asked it was that we
              hadn’t spoken to the people using Attract and who would develop
              their land with us. The people we were speaking to and learning
              about planning and development from weren’t our actual users. This
              meant we couldn’t begin testing our product’s commercial traction
              by asking if a user would pay for it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although we erred by not getting relevant user feedback while we
              had months of savings, the focus in the latter part of the raise
              to build a business plan was probably correct. We were working on
              Tract unpaid. As the deadline to raise money approached, our focus
              was (not unreasonably) on getting the funding to survive.
            </p>
            <p>
              These weeks were a success: we raised capital in a tough situation
              when the alternative was to shut down and get jobs. However, we
              had backed ourselves into a corner, not taking advantage of the
              previous time to run a rigorous market and product-discovery
              process.

              The Fundraise (January 2024 - April 2024)
            </h3>

            <p>
              Since raising capital, we've learned our fundraising experience
              was unusual. VCs operate with a fundamental asymmetry: it costs
              them virtually nothing to stay in touch with a company without
              investing, but missing the next unicorn can be catastrophic to
              their portfolio returns. This creates a dynamic where they'll meet
              hundreds of companies annually, rarely delivering outright
              rejections.
            </p>

            <p>
              Contrary to the "VCs never say no" stereotype, most were capable
              of clear passes: "not a market we know enough about" or "we're not
              convinced about this aspect of the pitch." The key insight is
              this: if a VC sees potential, they move quickly. If you're stuck
              in a holding pattern of positive but non-committal feedback, their
              current position is likely "no"—they're leaving the door open in
              case you gain traction or pivot to something more compelling.
            </p>

            <p>
              We found ourselves in this holding pattern. One VC was interested
              but nervous about leading the round, while at another, the lead
              partner wanted to write an angel check but wouldn't commit to
              funding institutionally. This created a frustrating cycle of
              meetings yielding positive feedback followed by requests for "just
              one more" spreadsheet or one-pager to clarify something. During
              this period, we worked to integrate early Attract usage data into
              our narrative about targeting small sites as land promoters.
            </p>

            <p>
              Through delicate back-channeling between the two firms, we got
              them as joint leads, with five angels joining the round. We then
              experienced that classic founder moment where, after securing a
              term sheet, several other firms expressed interest.
            </p>

            <p>
              The process from term sheet to closing took over a month. Despite
              being a straightforward priced round, we had to pay both teams
              lawyers to negotiate minor details. In San Francisco, a deal this
              size would have been done with a quick SAFE note, so it was
              frustrating to spend £25,000 out of the £744,000 we raised on
              legal fees.

              <strong>Warm intros are 100x better than cold outreach</strong> -
              maybe one or two VCs set up calls from a cold email, out of ~50,
              whereas nearly every warm intro was happy to talk to us. These
              came from former colleagues who became investors or had startups
              and introduced us to their VCs. People want to make and receive
              introductions. So, assuming you make a good impression, feel free

              busy) they will politely explain why.

              Unless you have hockey-stick growth and a surplus of investor
              interest, you need to work whichever angle you have, even if it
              means abandoning your existing plans.

            <p>
              <strong>Try to raise early rounds on a SAFE/ASA</strong> - even in
              tranches, even if it means accepting less cash or a lower
              valuation, even if it complicates your cap table. Despite capping
              legal fees at each stage, we spent £25,000 on lawyers – capital
              that should have gone toward building our business. We waited over
              a month for the money and were distracted figuring out legal
              terms.

            <p>
              <strong>Not every business suits VC</strong> - If you’re
              interested in technology or startups, you’ll hear lots from
              venture capitalists. This is partly because they engage in content
              marketing and thought leadership to attract dealflow and partly
              because being a VC requires optimism and interest in the future.
              So their interests will overlap with yours as a startup founder.
              But before you raise money from them, consider if your business
              fits their financing model. Venture investments follow a power law
              model. Venture investments follow a power law where a few pay off
              so well that they cover the others that go to ~zero.
            </p>

            <p>
              A good pitch to a VC should acknowledge the risks of the company
              failing, but not eliminate them. The focus should be on the huge
              opportunity if you overcome them. For decades, software companies
              fit this model. There’s a risky startup stage,but if a company
              survives, they can build moats through network effects (the most
              useful platform is the most popular) and switching costs
              (migrating data and workflows to a new system is hard).
            </p>

            <p>
              Not every business is like this. In real estate, you may have a
              thesis about where demand is going. You may make speculative
              acquisitions or invest in site improvements before selling. It’s
              unlikely these bets will pay off 100 to 1000x like the best
              venture investments. However, a good thesis and execution can
              generate an internal rate of return of 10 to 20% - more than
              keeping pace with a VC fund’s aggregate return. There are
              investors interested in these opportunities but they make less
              noise than VCs. They are often family offices, and may be the LPs
              of venture funds.
            </p>

            <p>
              Some companies try to balance being a high-risk bet with high per
              deal costs by raising money from VCs for an operating company and
              property investors for a property company. The former bet on the
              company growing to process many deals,while the latter bet on the
              success rate of those deals. These complex deals require careful
              alignment of everyone’s incentives.

              April to November 2024
            </h3>

            <p>
              Marketing to landowners proved difficult. An appraisal tool for
              farmers doesn't go viral. We identified things like niche Google
              searches e.g. specific DEFRA forms with low ad competition, but a
              few thousand pounds of ad spend generated minimal activity.
            </p>

            <p>
              The challenge: landowners might pay hundreds for an appraisal, but
              rarely need one. Identifying and reaching them at their moment of
              need was nearly impossible.
            </p>

            <p>We made two critical mistakes:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                We spent three months rebuilding the Appraisal tool before
                contacting landowners who had submitted sites through our MVP.
                These existing submissions represented our only real users, yet
                we failed to nurture these relationships or learn from them
                immediately. We didn't take them seriously enough as potential
                customers.
              </li>
              <li>
                Second, we failed to understand the basic economics of land
                agency—the business we were trying to replace. When we spoke
                with established land agents, we discovered uncomfortable
                truths: they completed very few referrals, and each took 18-24
                months minimum to process.
              </li>
            </ol>

            

            <p>
              Land agents are fragmented: many serve small geographic areas. A
              birds-eye view of this market suggests you can roll it up for
              economies of scale. We liked this logic, so we pursued it.
            </p>

            <p>
              We didn’t consider if the fragmentation was a feature rather than
              a bug. Each agent spends a lot of time building the social
              infrastructure – going to fairs, drinking in pubs, befriending the
              parish council – needed for these deals. Landowners are a small-c
              conservative customer, and they don’t respond well to audacious
              pitches and fast timetables. These deals take 18-24 months because
              these are emotional decisions, not scalable ones.
            </p>

            <p>
              Two or three phone calls could have revealed this reality and
              neutered any delusions about revolutionising this industry.
              Instead, we wasted six months—three building software and three
              wondering why nobody used it.
            </p>

            <p>
              Compounding these errors, we hired extra marketing and operations
              staff based on flawed assumptions:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                We had no evidence that more marketing would help without a
                proven customer acquisition strategy;
              </li>
              <li>
                We weren't constrained enough to justify these hires—we should
                have pushed ourselves harder first.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              We found a few promising sites where the landowner was eager to
              collaborate. However, further investigation revealed unique
              complications that would require bespoke work taking months to
              resolve before we even got onto the steps we aspired to automate.
              This wasn’t a deal breaker, but it would mean using nearly all our
              capital to bet on four sites over the next couple of years. If we
              got them through the system, we could make enough money to repeat
              the process at a greater scale. However, it was also possible that
              we wouldn’t. We would have spent two years working as conventional
              land promoters, which others could do better.
            </p>

            <p>
              As we considered the sites we had and ways to increase
              submissions, we explored higher leverage ways to use our skills.
              What was our comparative advantage? We could build software. So we
              dove back into the murky world of pure proptech.

              Interlude: The Grid (December 2024)
            </h3>

            <p>
              The state of our electricity grid is an important story. Whenever
              we met a developer, residential, commercial, or energy, the
              uncertainty about how long they would be stuck in the
              interconnection queue and how much they might pay in first or
              second comer charges would come up. Delays or unexpected charges
              could run into the millions.
            </p>

            <p>
              We lack good tools for modelling the grid. At the time of writing
              the
              <a href="https://www.neso.energy/publications/beyond-2030/web-map" target="_blank">National Energy System Operator’s map</a>
              thinks that Didcot is on the Isle of Wight, and Sizewell B is in
              Scotland. If you want to build something that will draw from or
              inject significant power into the grid, you need to know:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>What is the current capacity around your proposed site?</li>
              <li>What will the capacity be in the next few years?</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              We already had a map with layers like power line and substation
              locations, voltages, and official headroom capacity.
            </p>

            <p>
              DNOs publish their actual headroom monthly in tables called the
              embedded capacity register. It wouldn’t be hard to add that.
            </p>

            <p>
              We were scraping planning applications to build a model of future
              generation and demand growth.
            </p>

            <p>
              At the year’s end, we explored whether this was a worthwhile pivot
              opportunity. We found a couple of developers who hired
              consultancies to build internal tools at great expense. We found a
              couple of start-ups whose demos didn’t justify the huge prices for
              features on our roadmap. We had exciting conversations with one
              energy developer about a design partnership. They wanted a
              platform to find companies in the connection queue open to selling
              their spot.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our idea was speculative, requiring us to negotiate deals in an
              unfamiliar industry. Meanwhile, we were making progress with the
              Editor project. So we shelved this idea.
            </p>

            

            <h3 id="timeline-scout-december-2024">
              Interlude: Scout (December 2024)
            </h3>

            <p>
              While attempting to build a land promoter, we started using
              Landstack, a site sourcing tool, with good quality datasets that
              we hadn’t ingested. We had no desire to compete with them or steal
              their data. We made the mistake of asking for API access. They saw
              this as a red flag, investigated us, realised we were technical,
              and booted us off the platform. So we needed a replacement.
            </p>

            <p>
              We decided to build it ourselves. We had all the needed
              components: data ingestion and map layers. It took about one
              developer-week to create the first version.
            </p>

            <p>
              Why not release it? Allowing people to explore our data might:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>encourage inbound traffic;</li>
              <li>
                crowdsource the debugging and interrogation of our data for
                internal use;
              </li>
              <li>
                and help test the interface for a grid capacity discovery
                product, if we pursued that.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>We launched the tool, called Scout, shortly before Christmas.</p>

              Scout did well, with a few hundred visitors, some acclaim on
              Twitter and LinkedIn, and emails and comments thanking us for it;
              it was our most-used product.

              We’d like to think we caused a stressful Christmas at Landstack,

              Scout was our most-used product. Its users weren’t our target
              market, but some were. We had vague ambitions to use it as an
              inbound marketing tool, but we never capitalised on it. This was a
              missed opportunity.
            </p>

            <p>
              There was some accidental product-market fit. We found an organic
              audience for our side project; making our data free and easy to
              access provided genuine value.

              Tract Editor (December 2024 - March 2025)
            </h3>

            <p>
              During the same tech sprint that produced Scout, we started
              considering reviving the planning applications platform.
            </p>

            <p>
              We had all this information in our database – most required for
              the desk reports for planning applications – but were only using
              it for appraisals. To drive down the cost of planning
              applications, we needed to automate as much of the process as
              possible, including writing these reports.
            </p>

            <p>
              Since we abandoned the idea of doing property development
              ourselves, we considered selling the tool directly. Many US
              startups help draft documents in development and construction, so
              there was some precedent.
            </p>

            <p>
              A demo came together quickly. We dumped our appraisal output into
              a JSON blob. We parsed policies from an LPA's local plan. We built
              a document editor using open source components. We chained LLM
              prompts with our planning information – and got good results. A
              vision for this product began to form. We'd sell an LLM wrapper to
              planning consultants and developers to speed up document drafting.
              Then we'd expand to become the platform for managing all their
              projects, each with dozens of documents - hundreds with revisions.
              Hundreds of thousands of planning applications are submitted
              yearly, but no tool captures the institutional knowledge that
              compounds from project to project.
            </p>

            <p>
              This felt promising. It played to our strengths as software
              developers. There was a sales playbook we could follow and our
              investors would understand for the next round. Preliminary
              discussions suggested the market was more open to our product:
              even planners realised they needed an answer to the AI question.
            </p>

            <p>
              There was also a path to apply our technology to the US market,
              particularly California, which has its own housing crisis and
              legal hurdles.
            </p>

            <p>
              We could build tools to help people navigate applications like lot
              subdivisions or rezoning petitions, or a tool for searching trial
              court rulings. Developers sometimes sue the city council, and
              these rulings don’t automatically become planning policy like
              Planning Inspectorate rulings in England, but they’re useful.
              Developers pay land use attorneys a lot of money to research them.
              Or we could help multijurisdictional landlords keep up with
              different regulations.
            </p>

            <p>
              The common thread was our ability to ingest large numbers of
              documents, map their content onto a geospatial layer, and ask
              meaningful questions. Our technical foundation could support
              multiple business models in the UK and US.
            </p>

            <p>
              Expanding internationally would require significant resources and
              market knowledge. We decided to focus on validating our core
              product with UK customers before pursuing US opportunities.
            </p>

            

            <h4>Setting up design partnerships</h4>

            <p>
              Towards the end of 2024, we set up calls with several planning
              consultants. We asked about their workflows and what tools. We
              described our vision and showed them our demo. The responses were
              all positive.
            </p>

            <h4>Narrowing focus to pre-app letters</h4>

            <p>
              After a month of calls and building, we realised our product was
              too general-purpose. We needed to focus on a specific problem. We
              had little evidence of selling this software and wanted a clear
              use-case to ground our offering.
            </p>

            <p>
              We focused on pre-app statements. Most local authorities ask major
              developments to get pre-application advice: feedback on an initial
              proposal before submission, to ensure the basics are solid. It was
              the simplest document we saw. Most applications go through pre-app
              first – about 80%, according to one customer – it’s usually step
              one. We knew the costs and timelines, so we could anchor the
              pricing. And we had most of the information to generate them.
            </p>

            <p>
              This led to a product called Tract Editor. Users would draw their
              site boundaries on a map, and we would pull existing site
              information. We could generate and reuse our appraisal output, so
              this was easy. We could pass this information into an LLM to
              produce a first-draft pre-app statement.
            </p>

            <p>
              We’d add normal document editor features – comments, versioning,
              WYSIWYG, etc. – to integrate it into their workflow and avoid
              needing a perfect first draft. It could get you a reasonable
              starting point, like a junior planning consultant, which you could
              refine in a familiar environment.
            </p>

            <p>
              We built a good tool that produced compelling first drafts from
              minimal information. It had a smart Q&amp;A UI allowing the model to
              ask the user questions and regenerate sections based on the
              answers. It treated the planning system as a first-class citizen
              of the document editor, rather than focusing on the AI. It cited
              its sources and provided references for the quoted planning
              policy.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our design partners seemed happy. We had made a marketing website
              and received good feedback from industry people. We chose a price
              of £99/user/month. We were ready to start selling.

              By this stage, we knew to talk to customers before, during, and
              after building a demo, and we didn’t spend too much time coding
              before getting positive feedback. What we did wrong was assume
              ‘positive feedback’ meant ‘desire to purchase’.

              <strong>Customer switching costs have a psychological as well as
                economic logic.</strong>
              Better alone doesn’t mean people will use it. You’re competing
              with another workflow plus any status quo bias, which can be
              significant.

            </h3>

            <p>
              When we offered a 50% discount to our design partners and asked
              what would get them to commit, their response was telling. Despite
              positive feedback, they wanted significant additional features
              like full planning statements before signing. This forced us to
              confront several hard truths:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                Despite positive feedback, customers weren't ready to commit,
                even with steep discounts.
              </li>
              <li>
                After nearly two years, we had zero revenue to show for our
                efforts. (We clearly weren’t great at this!)
              </li>
              <li>
                Our opportunity cost was rising as the tech landscape evolved
                rapidly.
              </li>
              <li>
                While we might build a business that could support us, we
                couldn't see a path to the venture-scale returns our investors
                deserved.
              </li>
              <li>
                The British market was too small, fragmented, and resistant to
                change for us to progress at the speed and scale our investors
                required.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              Any one of these challenges could have been addressed. But
              collectively, they showed we faced months of struggling to secure
              small revenues through manual sales processes in a market with no
              clear path to venture-scale growth.
            </p>

            <p>
              We considered pivoting to the US and drastically reducing our burn
              rate. Ultimately, we chose to return the remaining capital to our
              investors and walk away.

            <p>
              We raised capital for an unconventional business model in a
              challenging sector. In a difficult fundraising environment, we
              secured funding from institutional investors and angels who
              believed in our vision to transform the British housing market.
              This is no small feat for a pre-revenue company in an industry not
              known for technological innovation.

              <li>
                Scout became a useful tool with recurring users and positive

              </li>
              <li>
                Our Appraisals product was fast, well-designed, and provided

            <p>
              When we recognised our land promotion strategy wasn’t working, we
              decided to pivot quickly. We parted ways with the non-technical
              employees not involved in building Tract Editor. We found design
              partners enthusiastic about our product and committed to giving us
              feedback, while keeping our investors informed about our strategic
              shift.

            <p>
              There are many ways in which we wasted time and money. But we are
              proud of the fact that we closed down the company because we
              couldn't see a way to make it work for our investors, and I think
              we can all sleep well knowing that we made the right call.

            <p>
              We developed valuable relationships. From planning consultants to
              developers to land agents, we built a network that provided
              insights, feedback, and opportunities that would have been
              invaluable had the business continued.
            </p>

            <p>
              We knew little about planning before this. But learned enough to
              build something that impressed the industry experts. This isn’t a
              complete win - we didn’t convert them to paying users. But they
              took us seriously. That’s not something we were certain we’d
              manage at the outset and gives us confidence moving forward.
            </p>

            <h3 id="reflections-reasonable-errors">Reasonable Errors</h3>

            <p>
              By 'reasonable', we mean mistakes that were understandable given
              the available information and our natural inclinations as
              founders.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our technical and product execution was strong. Our ultimate
              challenges were market selection, business model fit, and the
              British planning system’s dynamics rather than our ability to
              build useful technology.
            </p>

              Overestimating the British market's size and receptiveness
            </h4>

            <p>
              The British proptech and planning market seemed substantial, given
              the dramatic land value increases from planning permission. There
              seemed to be a venture-scale opportunity, especially as several
              British proptech companies secured funding during our journey.

            <p>
              If our software could help many sites secure planning permission,
              it made sense to capture as much of that value as possible. But we
              underestimated the uniqueness of each site’s challenges and the
              “hand-cranking” needed to get landowners over the line. The way to
              run a business like this is to use off-the-shelf tools and raise
              money from institutions seeking a less risky 10 to 20% IRR.

            </h4>

            <p>
              As technically-oriented founders, we gravitated toward building
              solutions. When faced with challenges, our impulse was to solve
              them with better technology rather than rethink our market
              approach. This technical optimism is common among founders with
              our background and was reinforced by the emergence of powerful new
              AI tools.

            <h4 id="reflections-building-a-team-too-early">
              Building a team too early
            </h4>

            <p>
              Conventional startup wisdom encourages bringing on talent to
              accelerate growth. With funding secured and ambitious goals,
              adding team members seemed logical.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is a classic startup dilemma: you need people to build and
              sell your product, but adding headcount increases burn rate and
              creates complexity before validating your revenue model. The error
              wasn't in hiring - many successful startups scaled their teams
              pre-revenue - but rather that we didn't have a clear hypothesis
              about how these hires would validate our core assumptions.
            </p>

            <p>
              There's no perfect formula here. Too little hiring can mean missed
              opportunities and founder burnout; too much creates financial
              pressure and overhead. Our mistake was not ensuring each hire was
              tightly coupled to the critical path to revenue.
            </p>

            <h4 id="reflections-not-entering-the-us-market">
              Not entering the US market
            </h4>

            <p>
              This might have offered more opportunities. Many VC-backed
              proptech companies founded before and during Tract’s lifetime
              (e.g. LandTech, SchemeFlow, PermitPortal) expanded to the US. Land
              use and zoning varies across US states, but traction in one may
              have been enough to raise the money to fund others.
            </p>

            <p>
              But our challenge was understanding users deeply enough to build
              something they'd pay for. If we struggled in our home market with
              networks and cultural understanding, it's not obvious we'd have
              fared better in the US.

              The US is the largest and most dynamic market. Even niche
              industries are large enough for venture-scale companies to exist.
              This is rarer in Britain.
            </p>

            <p>
              If your value proposition is built around saving labour costs or
              augmenting productivity, Britain’s lower median salaries are a
              ceiling on both the value you can create and the portion you can
              capture as a vendor.

              <li>
                Can you easily identify and access decision-makers? Markets with
                clear purchasing authority and shorter sales cycles allow faster
                iteration and learning.
              </li>
              <li>
                Do potential customers engage with product demos, respond
                promptly to communication, and provide actionable feedback?
              </li>
              <li>
                Are there self-contained pain points you can start selling a
                solution for, or a long tail of features customers need before
                they’ll pay?
              </li>
              <li>
                Is the customer base concentrated enough to build momentum
                through reference customers, or so diffuse that each sale
                requires starting from scratch?

              We hired too soon, rented an office, and spent money on
              branding/design before having a clear revenue route. Money gives
              you more latitude, which means more opportunities to avoid
              necessary actions.

              We focussed too much on building a theoretically sound business
              model and too little on testing it in the market. If we had asked
              “what have we learnt from users?” throughout 2024, it would have
              exposed that very little informing our product decisions came from
              conversations with our target market. Get traction with your
              target users before raising money.

              We were distracted by Tract’s potential to help solve the housing
              crisis. But since we never made any money, we couldn’t keep going,
              making it irrelevant. It’s great to have a mission beyond making
              money. But if it doesn’t contribute to making your business
              sustainable, it will need to take a back seat for a few years.

              The adage that ‘a rising tide lifts all boats’ is true, but
              incomplete. Success not only lifts you, but it changes you. It
              gives you more confidence, energy, and a faster learning rate.
              Conversely, treading water in a low-tide harms you. It saps your
              energy, forces you into strange epicycles. Beware treading water.

              We often learned something that showed us we had to change, but it
              took months to ask the right questions or perform the test. When
              considering an idea, think of ways to instantly find out if it’s
              flawed. For instance, it took too long to realise referring sites
              to developers through Attract wasn’t an easy way to get short-term
              revenue. We knew people who did referrals on the side and how the
              process worked but never drilled down into how long it took and
              what made the conversations drag on.

              I'm spending the next few weeks writing and attending to life
              admin. I'm tempted by the thought of another startup while the
              lessons from the last one are fresh. I'm giving thought to ways I
              can be useful before committing to the next path. Some things I'm
              interested in:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Buildings and urbanism.</strong> Similar to Tract's
                mission. I'm cautiously optimistic that we are going to increase
                the rate of building in the next few years in the places where
                it is most needed.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>I'm increasingly concerned by our shrinking industrial
                  base.&nbsp;</strong>
                In Britain, I think high energy costs are a major factor. And in
                both Europe and America I'm worried about what we can rely on if
                relations with China worsen.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>AI.</strong> Obviously the biggest story this decade the
                area in which I have the most professional experience.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>I'm open to relocating to the US.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Appeals and planning apps search.</strong> The industry

                semantic search (“give me every planning application in this
                borough within the last decade that was rejected because of a
                disagreement about materials”) could be a nice product.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>An accurate grid capacity map and trading platform.</strong>
                See Interlude: The Grid above.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Better industry-specific content.</strong> Most planning
                media is rubbish; an LLM could do just as good a job; thoughtful
                humans could do much better (<a href="https://gwern.net/matt-levine" target="_blank">who’s the Matt Levine of planning?</a>).

                <strong>LLM-powered web scraping.</strong> Frameworks like
                <a href="https://scrapy.org/" target="_blank">scrapy</a> and its

                are valuable, but many use cases need more intelligence, which
                modern LLMs could provide.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>A tech-enabled land promoter.</strong>
                We still think somebody should do this – just not via VC funding
                – but there are ways to reduce planning application costs and
                make this business work.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>This article was ported from my old Wordpress blog <a href="https://jeremykun.wordpress.com/2015/04/06/markov-chain-monte-carlo-without-all-the-bullshit/">here,</a> If you see any issues with the rendering or layout, please <a href="mailto:mathintersectprogramming@gmail.com">send me an email</a>.</p><div itemprop="articleBody" id="content"><p>I have a little secret: I don’t like the terminology, notation, and style of writing in statistics. I find it unnecessarily complicated. This shows up when trying to read about Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Take, for example, the abstract to the Markov Chain Monte Carlo article in the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/0470011815.b2a14021" rel="external">Encyclopedia of Biostatistics.</a></p><blockquote><p>Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a technique for estimating by simulation the expectation of a statistic in a complex model. Successive random selections form a Markov chain, the stationary distribution of which is the target distribution. It is particularly useful for the evaluation of posterior distributions in complex Bayesian models. In the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm, items are selected from an arbitrary “proposal” distribution and are retained or not according to an acceptance rule. The Gibbs sampler is a special case in which the proposal distributions are conditional distributions of single components of a vector parameter. Various special cases and applications are considered.</p></blockquote><p>I can only vaguely understand what the author is saying here (and really only because I know ahead of time what MCMC is). There are certainly references to more advanced things than what I’m going to cover in this post. But it seems very difficult to find an explanation of Markov Chain Monte Carlo <em>without</em> superfluous jargon. The “bullshit” here is the implicit claim of an author that such jargon is needed. Maybe it is to explain advanced applications (like attempts to do “inference in Bayesian networks”), but it is certainly not needed to define or analyze the basic ideas.</p><p>So to counter, here’s my own explanation of Markov Chain Monte Carlo, inspired by the treatment of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150204160331/http://research.microsoft.com/en-US/people/kannan/book-no-solutions-aug-21-2014.pdf" rel="external">John Hopcroft and Ravi Kannan</a>.</p><h2 id="the-problem-is-drawing-from-a-distribution">The Problem is Drawing from a Distribution</h2><p>Markov Chain Monte Carlo is a technique to solve the problem of <em>sampling from a complicated distribution.</em> Let me explain by the following imaginary scenario. Say I have a magic box which can estimate probabilities of baby names very well. I can give it a string like “Malcolm” and it will tell me the exact probability $ p_{\textup{Malcolm}}$ that you will choose this name for your next child. So there’s a distribution $ D$ over all names, it’s very specific to your preferences, and for the sake of argument say this distribution is fixed and you don’t get to tamper with it.</p><p>Now comes the problem: I want to <em>efficiently draw</em> a name from this distribution $ D$. This is the problem that Markov Chain Monte Carlo aims to solve. Why is it a problem? Because I have no idea what process you use to pick a name, so I can’t simulate that process myself. Here’s another method you could try: generate a name $ x$ uniformly at random, ask the machine for $ p_x$, and then flip a biased coin with probability $ p_x$ and use $ x$ if the coin lands heads. The problem with this is that there are exponentially many names! The variable here is the number of bits needed to write down a name $ n = |x|$. So either the probabilities $ p_x$ will be exponentially small and I’ll be flipping for a very long time to get a single name, or else there will only be a few names with nonzero probability and it will take me exponentially many draws to find them. Inefficiency is the death of me.</p><p>So this is a serious problem! Let’s restate it formally just to be clear.</p><p><strong>Definition (The sampling problem):</strong> Let $ D$ be a distribution over a finite set $ X$. You are given black-box access to the probability distribution function $ p(x)$ which outputs the probability of drawing $ x \in X$ according to $ D$. Design an efficient randomized algorithm $ A$ which outputs an element of $ X$ so that the probability of outputting $ x$ is approximately $ p(x)$. More generally, output a sample of elements from $ X$ drawn according to $ p(x)$.</p><p>Assume that $ A$ has access to only fair random coins, though this allows one to efficiently simulate flipping a <a href="https://www.jeremykun.com/2014/02/12/simulating-a-biased-coin-with-a-fair-coin/" title="Simulating a Biased Coin with a Fair Coin">biased coin of any desired probability</a>.</p><p>Notice that with such an algorithm we’d be able to do things like estimate the expected value of some random variable $ f : X \to \mathbb{R}$. We could take a large sample $ S \subset X$ via the solution to the sampling problem, and then compute the average value of $ f$ on that sample. This is what a Monte Carlo method does when sampling is easy. In fact, the Markov Chain solution to the sampling problem will allow us to do the sampling <em>and</em> the estimation of $ \mathbb{E}(f)$ in one fell swoop if you want.</p><p>But the core problem is really a sampling problem, and “Markov Chain Monte Carlo” would be more accurately called the “Markov Chain Sampling Method.” So let’s see why a Markov Chain could possibly help us.</p><h2 id="random-walks-the-markov-chain-part-of-mcmc">Random Walks, the “Markov Chain” part of MCMC</h2><p>Markov Chain is essentially a fancy term for a random walk on a graph.</p><p>You give me a directed graph $ G = (V,E)$, and for each edge $ e = (u,v) \in E$ you give me a number $ p_{u,v} \in [0,1]$. In order to make a random walk make sense, the $ p_{u,v}$ need to satisfy the following constraint:</p><p>For any vertex $ x \in V$, the set all values $ p_{x,y}$ on outgoing edges $ (x,y)$ must sum to 1, i.e. form a probability distribution.</p><p>If this is satisfied then we can take a random walk on $ G$ according to the probabilities as follows: start at some vertex $ x_0$. Then pick an outgoing edge at random according to the probabilities on the outgoing edges, and follow it to $ x_1$. Repeat if possible.</p><p>I say “if possible” because an arbitrary graph will not necessarily have any outgoing edges from a given vertex. We’ll need to impose some additional conditions on the graph in order to apply random walks to Markov Chain Monte Carlo, but in any case the idea of randomly walking is well-defined, and we call the whole object $ (V,E, \{ p_e \}_{e \in E})$ a <em>Markov chain.</em></p><p>Here is an example where the vertices in the graph correspond to emotional states.</p><figure><img src="https://www.jeremykun.com/img/2015/markov01.gif" width="646px"><figcaption><h4>An example Markov chain</h4></figcaption></figure><p>In statistics land, they take the “state” interpretation of a random walk very seriously. They call the edge probabilities “state-to-state transitions.” The main theorem we need to do anything useful with Markov chains is the stationary distribution theorem (sometimes called the “Fundamental Theorem of Markov Chains,” and for good reason). What it says intuitively is that for a very long random walk, the probability that you end at some vertex $ v$ is independent of where you started! All of these probabilities taken together is called the <em>stationary distribution</em> of the random walk, and it is uniquely determined by the Markov chain.</p><p>However, for the reasons we stated above (“if possible”), the stationary distribution theorem is not true of every Markov chain. The main property we need is that the graph $ G$ is <em>strongly connected.</em> Recall that a directed graph is called connected if, when you ignore direction, there is a path from every vertex to every other vertex. It is called <em>strongly connected</em> if you still get paths everywhere when considering direction. If we additionally require the stupid edge-case-catcher that no edge can have zero probability, then strong connectivity (of one component of a graph) is equivalent to the following property:</p><p>For every vertex $ v \in V(G)$, an infinite random walk started at $ v$ will return to $ v$ with probability 1.</p><p>In fact it will return infinitely often. This property is called the <em>persistence</em> of the state $ v$ by statisticians. I dislike this term because it appears to describe a property of a vertex, when to me it describes a property of the connected component containing that vertex. In any case, since in Markov Chain Monte Carlo we’ll be picking the graph to walk on (spoiler!) we will ensure the graph is strongly connected by design.</p><p>Finally, in order to describe the stationary distribution in a more familiar manner (using linear algebra), we will write the transition probabilities as a matrix $ A$ where entry $ a_{j,i} = p_{(i,j)}$ if there is an edge $ (i,j) \in E$ and zero otherwise. Here the rows and columns correspond to vertices of $ G$, and each <em>column</em> $ i$ forms the probability distribution of going from state $ i$ to some other state in one step of the random walk. Note $ A$ is the transpose of the weighted adjacency matrix of the directed weighted graph $ G$ where the weights are the transition probabilities (the reason I do it this way is because matrix-vector multiplication will have the matrix on the left instead of the right; see below).</p><p>This matrix allows me to describe things nicely using the language of linear algebra. In particular if you give me a basis vector $ e_i$ interpreted as “the random walk currently at vertex $ i$,” then $ Ae_i$ gives a vector whose $ j$-th coordinate is the probability that the random walk would be at vertex $ j$ after one more step in the random walk. Likewise, if you give me a probability distribution $ q$ over the vertices, then $ Aq$ gives a probability vector interpreted as follows:</p><p>If a random walk is in state $ i$ with probability $ q_i$, then the $ j$-th entry of $ Aq$ is the probability that after one more step in the random walk you get to vertex $ j$.</p><p>Interpreted this way, the stationary distribution is a probability distribution $ \pi$ such that $ A \pi = \pi$, in other words $ \pi$ is an eigenvector of $ A$ with eigenvalue 1.</p><p>A quick side note for avid readers of this blog: this analysis of a random walk is exactly what we did back in the early days of this blog when we studied <a href="https://www.jeremykun.com/2011/06/12/googles-pagerank-introduction/" title="Google’s PageRank – Introduction">the PageRank algorithm</a> for ranking webpages. There we called the matrix $ A$ “a web matrix,” did random walks on it, and found a special eigenvalue whose eigenvector was a “stationary distribution” that we used to rank web pages (this used something called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perron%E2%80%93Frobenius_theorem" rel="external">Perron-Frobenius theorem</a>, which says a random-walk matrix has that special eigenvector). There we described an algorithm to actually find that eigenvector by iteratively multiplying $ A$. The following theorem is essentially a variant of this algorithm but works under weaker conditions; for the web matrix we added additional “fake” edges that give the needed stronger conditions.</p><p><strong>Theorem:</strong> Let $ G$ be a strongly connected graph with associated edge probabilities $ \{ p_e \}_e \in E$ forming a Markov chain. For a probability vector $ x_0$, define $ x_{t+1} = Ax_t$ for all $ t \geq 1$, and let $ v_t$ be the long-term average $ v_t = \frac1t \sum_{s=1}^t x_s$. Then:</p><ol><li>There is a unique probability vector $ \pi$ with $ A \pi = \pi$.</li><li>For all $ x_0$, the limit $ \lim_{t \to \infty} v_t = \pi$.</li></ol><p><em>Proof.</em> Since $ v_t$ is a probability vector we just want to show that $ |Av_t – v_t| \to 0$ as $ t \to \infty$. Indeed, we can expand this quantity as</p><p>$$\displaystyle \begin{aligned} Av_t – v_t &amp;=\frac1t (Ax_0 + Ax_1 + \dots + Ax_{t-1}) – \frac1t (x_0 + \dots + x_{t-1}) \\\ &amp;= \frac1t (x_t – x_0) \end{aligned}$$</p><p>But $ x_t, x_0$ are unit vectors, so their difference is at most 2, meaning $ |Av_t – v_t| \leq \frac2t \to 0$. Now it’s clear that this does not depend on $ v_0$. For uniqueness we will cop out and appeal to the Perron-Frobenius theorem that says any matrix of this form has a unique such (normalized) eigenvector.</p><p>$$\square$$</p><p>One additional remark is that, in addition to computing the stationary distribution by actually computing this average or using an eigensolver, one can analytically solve for it as the inverse of a particular matrix. Define $ B = A-I_n$, where $ I_n$ is the $ n \times n$ identity matrix. Let $ C$ be $ B$ with a row of ones appended to the bottom and the topmost row removed. Then one can show (quite opaquely) that the last column of $ C^{-1}$ is $ \pi$. We leave this as an exercise to the reader, because I’m pretty sure nobody uses this method in practice.</p><p>One final remark is about why we need to take an average over all our $ x_t$ in the theorem above. There is an extra technical condition one can add to strong connectivity, called <em>aperiodicity</em>, which allows one to beef up the theorem so that $ x_t$ itself converges to the stationary distribution. Rigorously, aperiodicity is the property that, regardless of where you start your random walk, after some sufficiently large number of steps $ n$ the random walk has a positive probability of being at every vertex at every subsequent step. As an example of a graph where aperiodicity fails: an undirected cycle on an even number of vertices. In that case there will only be a positive probability of being at certain vertices every <em>other</em> step, and averaging those two long term sequences gives the actual stationary distribution.</p><figure><img src="https://www.jeremykun.com/img/2015/screen-shot-2015-04-07-at-6-55-39-pm.png" width="377px"><figcaption><h4>Image source: Wikipedia</h4></figcaption></figure><p>One way to guarantee that your Markov chain is aperiodic is to ensure there is a positive probability of staying at any vertex. I.e., that your graph has a self-loop. This is what we’ll do in the next section.</p><h2 id="constructing-a-graph-to-walk-on">Constructing a graph to walk on</h2><p>Recall that the problem we’re trying to solve is to draw from a distribution over a finite set $ X$ with probability function $ p(x)$. The MCMC method is to construct a Markov chain whose stationary distribution is exactly $ p$, even when you just have black-box access to evaluating $ p$. That is, you (implicitly) pick a graph $ G$ and (implicitly) choose transition probabilities for the edges to make the stationary distribution $ p$. Then you take a long enough random walk on $ G$ and output the $ x$ corresponding to whatever state you land on.</p><p>The easy part is coming up with a graph that has the right stationary distribution (in fact, “most” graphs will work). The hard part is to come up with a graph where you can prove that the convergence of a random walk to the stationary distribution is fast in comparison to the size of $ X$. Such a proof is beyond the scope of this post, but the “right” choice of a graph is not hard to understand.</p><p>The one we’ll pick for this post is called the <strong>Metropolis-Hastings</strong> algorithm. The input is your black-box access to $ p(x)$, and the output is a set of rules that implicitly define a random walk on a graph whose vertex set is $ X$.</p><p>It works as follows: you pick some way to put $ X$ on a lattice, so that each state corresponds to some vector in $ \{ 0,1, \dots, n\}^d$. Then you add (two-way directed) edges to all neighboring lattice points. For $ n=5, d=2$ it would look like this:</p><figure><a href="https://www.jeremykun.com/img/2015/2dlattice.jpg"><img src="https://www.jeremykun.com/img/2015/2dlattice.jpg" width="195px"></a><figcaption><h4>Image credit http://www.ams.org/samplings/feature-column/fcarc-taxi</h4></figcaption></figure><p>And for $ d=3, n \in \{2,3\}$ it would look like this:</p><figure><a href="https://www.jeremykun.com/img/2015/lattice.gif"><img src="https://www.jeremykun.com/img/2015/lattice.gif" width="343px"></a><figcaption><h4>lattice</h4></figcaption></figure><p>You have to be careful here to ensure the vertices you choose for $ X$ are not disconnected, but in many applications $ X$ is naturally already a lattice.</p><p>Now we have to describe the transition probabilities. Let $ r$ be the maximum degree of a vertex in this lattice ($ r=2d$). Suppose we’re at vertex $ i$ and we want to know where to go next. We do the following:</p><ol><li>Pick neighbor $ j$ with probability $ 1/r$ (there is some chance to stay at $ i$).</li><li>If you picked neighbor $ j$ and $ p(j) \geq p(i)$ then deterministically go to $ j$.</li><li>Otherwise, $ p(j) &lt; p(i)$, and you go to $ j$ with probability $ p(j) / p(i)$.</li></ol><p>We can state the probability weight $ p_{i,j}$ on edge $ (i,j)$ more compactly as</p><p>$$\displaystyle p_{i,j} = \frac1r \min(1, p(j) / p(i)) \\\ p_{i,i} = 1 – \sum_{(i,j) \in E(G); j \neq i} p_{i,j}$$</p><p>It is easy to check that this is indeed a probability distribution for each vertex $ i$. So we just have to show that $ p(x)$ is the stationary distribution for this random walk.</p><p>Here’s a fact to do that: if a probability distribution $ v$ with entries $ v(x)$ for each $ x \in X$ has the property that $ v(x)p_{x,y} = v(y)p_{y,x}$ for all $ x,y \in X$, the $ v$ is the stationary distribution. To prove it, fix $ x$ and take the sum of both sides of that equation over all $ y$. The result is exactly the equation $ v(x) = \sum_{y} v(y)p_{y,x}$, which is the same as $ v = Av$. Since the stationary distribution is the unique vector satisfying this equation, $ v$ has to be it.</p><p>Doing this with out chosen $ p(i)$ is easy, since $ p(i)p_{i,j}$ and $ p(i)p_{j,i}$ are both equal to $ \frac1r \min(p(i), p(j))$ by applying a tiny bit of algebra to the definition. So we’re done! One can just randomly walk according to these probabilities and get a sample.</p><h2 id="last-words">Last words</h2><p>The last thing I want to say about MCMC is to show that you can estimate the expected value of a function $ \mathbb{E}(f)$ simultaneously while random-walking through your Metropolis-Hastings graph (or any graph whose stationary distribution is $ p(x)$). By definition the expected value of $ f$ is $ \sum_x f(x) p(x)$.</p><p>Now what we can do is compute the average value of $ f(x)$ just among those states we’ve visited during our random walk. With a little bit of extra work you can show that this quantity will converge to the true expected value of $ f$ at about the same time that the random walk converges to the stationary distribution. (Here the “about” means we’re off by a constant factor depending on $ f$). In order to prove this you need some extra tools I’m too lazy to write about in this post, but the point is that it works.</p><p>The reason I did not start by describing MCMC in terms of estimating the expected value of a function is because the core problem is a sampling problem. Moreover, there are many applications of MCMC that need nothing more than a sample. For example, MCMC can be used to estimate the volume of an arbitrary (maybe high dimensional) convex set. See <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~sinclair/cs294/n1.pdf" rel="external">these lecture notes</a> of Alistair Sinclair for more.</p><p>If demand is popular enough, I could implement the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in code (it wouldn’t be industry-strength, but perhaps illuminating? I’m not so sure…).</p><p>Until next time!</p><hr><hr></div></div>]]></description>

The government continues to make considerable efforts to support MITRE’s role in the program, and MITRE remains committed to CVE as a global resource.”</p>



<h2 id="end-of-cve-program-seen-as-tragic">End of CVE program seen as ‘tragic’</h2>



<p>Sasha Romanosky, senior policy researcher at the Rand Corporation, branded the end to the CVE program as “tragic,” a sentiment echoed by many cybersecurity and CVE experts reached for comment.</p>
</div>
							
							<div>


<p>“CVE naming and assignment to software packages and versions are the foundation upon which the software vulnerability ecosystem is based,” Romanosky said. “Without it, we can’t track newly discovered vulnerabilities. We can’t score their severity or predict their exploitation. And we certainly wouldn’t be able to make the best decisions regarding patching them.”</p>

		

			


<p>Ben Edwards, principal research scientist at Bitsight, told CSO, “My reaction is sadness and disappointment. This is a valuable resource that should absolutely be funded, and not renewing the contract is a mistake.”</p>



<p>He added “I am hopeful any interruption is brief and that if the contract fails to be renewed, other stakeholders within the ecosystem can pick up where MITRE left off. The federated framework and openness of the system make this possible, but it’ll be a rocky road if operations do need to shift to another entity.”</p>
</div>

<h2 id="mitres-cve-program-foundational-to-cybersecurity">MITRE’s CVE program foundational to cybersecurity</h2>



<p>MITRE’s <a href="https://www.cve.org/">CVE program</a> is a foundational pillar of the global cybersecurity ecosystem and is the de facto standard for identifying vulnerabilities and guiding defenders’ vulnerability management programs. It provides foundational data to vendor products across vulnerability management, cyber threat intelligence, security information, event management, and endpoint detection and response.</p>



<p>Although the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) enriches the MITRE CVE records with additional information through its <a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/nvd">National Vulnerability Database</a> (NVD), and CISA has helped enrich MITRE’s CVE records with its “<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/unlocking-vulnrichment-enriching-cve-data">vulnrichment</a>” program <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2106228/backlogs-at-national-vulnerability-database-prompt-action-from-nist-and-cisa.html">due to funding shortfalls in the NVD program</a>, MITRE is the originator of the <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/562175/what-is-cve-its-definition-and-purpose.html">CVE records</a> and serves at the primary source for identifying security flaws.</p>



<p>“If MITRE’s funding goes away, it causes an immediate cascading effect that will impact vulnerability management on a global scale,” Brian Martin, vulnerability historian, CSO of the Security Errata project, and former CVE board member, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7318000614334943232/">wrote</a> on LinkedIn.</p>
</div>
							
							<div>


<p>“First, the federated model and CVE Numbering Authorities (CNA) can no longer assign IDs and send info to MITRE for quick publication. Second, all of that is the foundation for the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), which is already beyond struggling, with a backlog of over 30,000 vulnerabilities and the recent announcement of over 80,000 ‘deferred’ (meaning will not be fully analyzed by their current standards).”</p>



<p>Martin added, “Third, every company that maintains ‘their own vulnerability database’ that is essentially lipstick on the CVE pig will have to find alternate sources of intelligence. Fourth, national vulnerability databases like China’s and Russia’s, among others, will largely dry up (Russia more than China). Fourth [sic], hundreds, if not thousands, of National / Regional CERTs around the world, no longer have that source of free vulnerability intelligence. Fifth [sic], every company in the world that relied on CVE/NVD for vulnerability intelligence is going to experience swift and sharp pains to their vulnerability management program.”</p>



<h2 id="why-is-the-contract-ending">Why is the contract ending?</h2>



<p>It’s unclear what led to DHS’s decision to end the contract after 25 years of funding <a href="https://cyberscoop.com/cve-program-history-mitre-nist-1999-2024/">the highly regarded</a> program. The Trump administration, primarily through Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency initiative, has been slashing government spending across the board, particularly at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), through which DHS funds the MITRE CVE program.</p>
</div>
							
							<div>


<p>Although CISA has already been through two funding cuts, press reports suggest that nearly 40% of the agency’s staff, or around 1,300 employees, <a href="https://therecord.media/trump-administration-planning-workforce-cuts-at-cisa">are still slated</a> for termination. However, sources say that compared to the budget cuts made elsewhere in the federal government, the expense of running the CVE program are minor and “won’t break the bank.”</p>



<h2 id="what-happens-next">What happens next?</h2>



<p>Sources close to the CVE program say that starting at midnight on April 16, MITRE will no longer add records to its CVE database. However, historical CVE records will be <a href="https://github.com/CVEProject">available on GitHub</a>.</p>



<p>The real question is whether a private sector alternative to MITRE’s program emerges.</p>
</div>
							
							<div>


<p>“It’s difficult to speculate on what services could be impacted reading the note from MITRE,” Patrick Garrity, a security researcher at threat intelligence firm Vulncheck, told CSO. “The current vulnerability ecosystem is fragile after seeing NIST NVD’s failure last year, and any impacts to the CVE Program could have detrimental impacts on defenders and the security community. VulnCheck remains committed to helping fill any gaps that might arise.”</p>



<p>Garrity <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7318000766122618881/">posted on LinkedIn</a>, “Given the current uncertainty surrounding which services at MITRE or within the CVE Program may be affected, VulnCheck has proactively reserved 1,000 CVEs for 2025,” adding that Vulncheck “will continue to provide CVE assignments to the community in the days and weeks ahead.”</p>



<p>A CISA spokesperson told CSO, “CISA is the primary sponsor for the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) program, which is used by government and industry alike to disclose, catalog, and share information on&nbsp;technology vulnerabilities that can put the nation’s critical infrastructure at risk.&nbsp; Although CISA’s contract with the MITRE Corporation will lapse after April 16, we are&nbsp;urgently&nbsp;working to&nbsp;mitigate impact and to maintain CVE services&nbsp;on which global stakeholders rely.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>US government funding for the world's CVE program – the centralized Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database of product security flaws – ends Wednesday.</p>
<p>The 25-year-old CVE program plays a huge role in vulnerability management. It is responsible overseeing the assignment and organizing of unique CVE ID numbers, such as <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160">CVE-2014-0160</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5754">CVE-2017-5754</a>, for specific vulnerabilities, in this case OpenSSL's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2014/04/09/heartbleed_explained/">Heartbleed</a> and Intel's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/01/02/intel_cpu_design_flaw/">Meltdown</a>, so that when referring to particular flaws and patches, everyone is agreed on exactly what we're all talking about.</p>
<p>It is used by companies big and small, developers, researchers, the public sector, and more as the primary system for identifying and squashing bugs. When multiple people find the same hole, CVEs are useful for ensuring everyone is working toward that one specific issue.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>CVE is a cornerstone of cybersecurity, and any gaps in CVE support will put our critical infrastructure and national security at unacceptable risk</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the whole world's vulnerability management efforts aren't going to descend into chaos overnight, there is a concern that in a month or two they may. The lack of US government funding means that, unless someone else steps in to fill the gap, this standardized system for naming and tracking vulnerabilities may falter or shut down, new CVEs may no longer be published, and the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cve.mitre.org/">program's website</a> may go offline.</p>
<p>Not-for-profit outfit MITRE has a contract with the US Department of Homeland Security to operate the CVE program, and on Tuesday the group confirmed this arrangement has not been renewed. This comes as the Trump administration scours around the federal government for costs to trim.</p>

    

<p>"On Wednesday, April 16, funding for MITRE to develop, operate, and modernize the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Program and related programs, such as the Common Weakness Enumeration Program, will expire," Yosry Barsoum, MITRE's vice president and director at the Center for Securing the Homeland, told <em>The Register</em>.&nbsp;</p>

        


        

<p>"The government continues to make considerable efforts to support MITRE's role in the program and MITRE remains committed to CVE as a global resource," Barsoum added.</p>
<p>The Common Weakness Enumeration program is a centrally managed <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cwe.mitre.org/">database</a> of bug types.</p>

        

<p>The expiration came to light after a letter sent to CVE program board members was <a target="_blank" href="https://bsky.app/profile/tib3rius.bsky.social/post/3lmulrbygoe2g" rel="nofollow">leaked</a> on Bluesky. In that memo, Barsoum confided:</p>

<p>Historical CVE records will at least remain <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/CVEProject" rel="nofollow">available at GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>"CVE is a cornerstone of cybersecurity, and any gaps in CVE support will put our critical infrastructure and national security at unacceptable risk," Luta Security founder and CEO Katie Moussouris, who pioneered Microsoft's vulnerability disclosure program, told <em>The Register</em>.</p>
<p>"All industries worldwide depend on the CVE program to keep their heads above water when it comes to managing threats, so an abrupt halt like this would be like depriving the cybersecurity industry of oxygen and expecting it to spontaneously sprout gills," Moussouris said.</p>
<p>It basically works like this: When an individual researcher or an organization discovers a new bug in some product, a CVE program partner — there are currently <a href="https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners" rel="nofollow">a few hundred across 40 countries</a> — is asked to assess the vulnerability report and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://blog.httpcs.com/en/cve-en/">assign</a> a unique CVE identifier for the flaw if and as necessary.</p>

        

<p>The program is <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities#:~:text=The%20CVE%20Program%20is%20sponsored,catalog%20publicly%20disclosed%20cybersecurity%20vulnerabilities.">sponsored</a>, and largely <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_70RCSJ23FR0000015_7001_70RSAT20D00000001_7001">funded</a> by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, aka CISA, under the umbrella of the US Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>"I can say that, having been in this industry for longer than CVEs themselves, it won't be good," Dustin Childs, head of threat awareness at Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative, told <em>The Register</em>.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I can say that, having been in this industry for longer than CVEs themselves, it won't be good</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Before CVEs, each company referred to vulnerabilities using their own vernacular," he added. "Customers were confused about whether they were protected or impacted from a particular bug. And was a time when there were much fewer companies and infinitely fewer bugs."</p>
<p>To put this in perspective: More than <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://jerrygamblin.com/2025/01/05/2024-cve-data-review//">40,000 new CVEs</a> were published last year.</p>
<p>"If MITRE were to lose funding for the CVE, we can expect considerable confusion again until someone else picks up the flag," Childs continued, noting that this would require some sort of industry consortium —&nbsp;but nothing along those lines currently exists.</p>
<p>"Vulnerability management will become a mess as enterprises struggle to confirm they are in compliance with regulations and directives," he said. "Let's hope this is resolved quickly."</p>

</ul>
<p>VulnCheck, a private vulnerability intel company that is also a CVE Naming Authority, aka CNA, on Tuesday said it has proactively <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7318000766122618881/">reserved</a> 1,000 CVEs for 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, this only preserves the functionality of the program for a couple months at best.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The security industry needs to step in to fill the void</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"MITRE, as a CNA, issues between 300-600 CVEs each month, so by reserving 1,000 hypothetically, we can assign a CVE to vulnerabilities for 1-2 months as long as the core service continues," Patrick Garrity, security researcher at VulnCheck, told <em>The Register</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The CVE program is a critical resource globally used by nearly every organization in the world, so the implications of a pause will have downstream implications for security tooling, security teams, and every organization that cares about security," he added.</p>
<p>"It would be terrible to see government funding for the CVE program go away, but we also believe that this is a time when the security industry needs to step in to fill the void." ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Robots are taking over much of the daily manual labor at dairy farms, including milking, feeding, cleaning, and more. It makes dairy farmers’ lives easier, and makes the cows happier, too.</p><div data-headline="How Dairy Robots Are Changing Work for Cows (and Farmers)"><p><em>
		“Mooooo.”
		</em></p><p><strong>This dairy barn is</strong> full of cows, as you might expect. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-zYshsAg1E" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cows are being milked</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wm_Iul30Sx0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cows are being fed</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCJxN_3nnEc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cows are being cleaned up after</a>, and a few very happy cows are even getting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq1j4ImZxcw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vigorously scratched behind the ears</a>. “I wonder where the farmer is,” remarks my guide, Jan Jacobs. Jacobs doesn’t seem especially worried, though—the several hundred cows in this barn are being well cared for by a small fleet of fully <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/autonomous-robots">autonomous robots</a>, and the farmer might not be back for hours. The robots will let him know if anything goes wrong.
</p><p>
	At one of the milking robots, several cows are lined up, nose to tail, politely waiting their turn. The cows can get milked by robot whenever they like, which typically means
	<a href="https://www.lely.com/us/solutions/organic-grazing/faq/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> more frequently than the twice a day</a> at a traditional dairy farm. Not only is getting milked more often more comfortable for the cows, <a href="https://www.lely.com/us/solutions/organic-grazing/production/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cows also produce about 10 percent more milk</a> when the milking schedule is completely up to them.
</p><p>
	“There’s a direct correlation between stress and milk production,” Jacobs says. “Which is nice, because robots make cows happier and therefore, they give more milk, which helps us sell more robots.”
</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-jacobs-59296828/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jan Jacobs</a> is the human-robot interaction design lead for <a href="https://www.lely.com/us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lely</a>, a maker of agricultural machinery. Founded in 1948 in Maassluis, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/netherlands">Netherlands</a>, Lely deployed its first Astronaut milking robot in the early 1990s. The company has since developed other robotic systems that assist with cleaning, feeding, and cow comfort, and the Astronaut milking robot is on its <a href="https://www.lely.com/media/lely-centers-files/brochures/published/astronaut_a5_brochure_e_en.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fifth generation</a>. Lely is now focused entirely on robots for dairy farms, with around 135,000 of them deployed around the world.
</p><h2>Essential Jobs on Dairy Farms</h2><p><span>The weather outside the barn is miserable. It’s late fall in the Netherlands, and a cold rain is gusting in from the sea, which is probably why the cows have quite sensibly decided to stay indoors and why the farmer is still nowhere to be found. Lely requires that dairy farmers who adopt its robots commit to letting their cows move freely between milking, feeding, and resting, as well as inside and outside the barn, at their own pace. “We believe that free cow traffic is a core part of the future of farming,” Jacobs says as we watch one cow stroll away from the milking robot while another takes its place. This is possible only when the farm operates on the cows’ schedule rather than a human’s.</span></p><p>
	A conventional dairy farm relies heavily on human labor. Lely estimates that repetitive daily tasks represent about a third of the average workday of a dairy farmer. In the morning, the cows are milked for the first time. Most dairy cows must be milked at least twice a day or they’ll become uncomfortable, and so the herd will line up on their own. Traditional milking parlors are designed to maximize human milking efficiency. A milking carousel, for instance, slowly rotates cows as they’re milked so that the dairy worker doesn’t have to move between stalls.

	An experienced human using well-optimized equipment can attach a milking machine to a cow 
	<a href="https://www.vet.cornell.edu/animal-health-diagnostic-center/programs/quality-milk-production-services/services/parlor-efficiency" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in just 20 to 30 seconds</a>. The actual milking takes only a few minutes, but with the average small dairy farm in North America providing a home for <a href="https://hoards.com/article-34810-familiar-dairy-industry-trends-continue.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">several hundred cows</a>, milking typically represents a time commitment of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030222003228#fig2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">4 to 6 hours per day</a>.
</p><p>
	There are other jobs that must be done every day at a dairy. 
	<a href="https://www.dairyherd.com/news/education/how-often-should-you-push-feed" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cows are happier with continuous access to food</a>, which means feeding them several times a day. <a href="https://www.americandairy.com/dairy-diary/what-do-dairy-cows-eat/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The feed is a mix of roughage (hay), silage (grass), and grain</a>. The cows will eat all of this, but they prefer the grain, and so it’s common to see cows sorting their food by grabbing a mouthful and throwing it up into the air. The lighter roughage and silage flies farther than the grain does, leaving the cow with a pile of the tastier stuff as the rest gets tossed out of reach. This makes “<a href="https://www.dairyherd.com/news/education/how-often-should-you-push-feed" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">feed pushing</a>” necessary to shove the rest of the feed back within reach of the cow.
</p><p>
	And of course there’s manure. A dairy cow produces an average of 
	<a href="https://thedairylandinitiative.vetmed.wisc.edu/home/housing-module/adult-cow-housing/manure-management/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">68 kilograms of manure a day</a>. All that manure has to be collected and the barn floors regularly cleaned.
</p><h2>Dairy <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/industry-4-0">Industry 4.0</a></h2><p>
	The amount of labor needed to operate a dairy meant that until the early 1900s, 
	<a href="https://youtu.be/sjmflKg-v2o?t=1049" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">most family farms could support only about eight cows</a>. The introduction of the first milking machines, called <a href="https://www.surgemilker.com/history.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bucket milkers</a>, helped farmers milk 10 cows per hour instead of 4 by the mid-1920s. <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/rural-electrification">Rural electrification</a> furthered dairy <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/automation">automation</a> starting in the 1950s, and since then, both farm size and milk production have increased steadily. In the 1930s, a good dairy cow <a href="https://youtu.be/sjmflKg-v2o?t=1631" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">produced 3,600 kilograms of milk per year</a>. <a href="https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/h989r321c/mg74sh83p/nc582h285/mkpr0225.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Today, it’s almost 11,000 kilograms</a>, and Lely believes that robots are what will enable small dairy farms to continue to scale sustainably.

The Astronaut A5, Lely’s latest milking robot, uses a laser-guided <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/robot-arm">robot arm</a> to clean the cow’s udder before attaching teat cups one at a time. While the cow munches on treats, the Astronaut monitors her milk output, collecting data on 32 parameters, including indicators of the quality of the milk and the health of the cow. When milking is complete, the robot cleans the udder again, and the cow is free to leave as the robot steam cleans itself in preparation for the next cow.</span></p><p><a href="https://www.lely.com/gb/centers/midlands/what-cost-milking-robot/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lely argues</a> that although the initial cost is higher than that of a traditional milking parlor, the robots pay for themselves over time through higher milk production (due primarily to increased milking frequency) and lower labor costs. Lely’s other robots can also save on labor. The Vector mobile robot handles continuous feeding and feed pushing, and the Discovery Collector is a robotic manure vacuum that keeps the floors clean.

	For most dairy farmers, though, making more money is not the main reason to get a robot, explains 
	<a href="https://ansci.umn.edu/people/marcia-endres" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Marcia Endres</a>, a professor in the department of animal science at the University of Minnesota. Endres specializes in dairy-cattle management, behavior, and welfare, and studies dairy robot adoption. “When we first started doing research on this about 12 years ago, most of the farms that were installing robots were smaller farms that did not want to hire employees,” Endres says. “They wanted to do the work just with family labor, but they also wanted to have more flexibility with their time. They wanted a better lifestyle.”
</p><p>
	Flexibility was key for the Takes family, who 
	<a href="https://youtu.be/vZY8TbBoDd0?t=147" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">added Lely robots to their dairy farm</a> in Ely, Iowa, four years ago. “When we had our old milking parlor, everything that we did as a family was always scheduled around milking,” says Josie Rozum, who manages the farm and a creamery along with her parents—Dan and Debbie Takes—and three brothers. “With the robots, we can prioritize our personal life a little bit more—we can spend time together on Christmas morning and know that the cows are still getting milked.”
</p><p><a href="https://www.dananddebbies.com/about/the-farm/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Takes Family Dairy Farm</a>’s 120-cow herd is milked by a pair of Astronaut A5 robots, with a Vector and three Discovery Collectors for feeding and cleaning. “They’ve become a crucial part of the team,” explains Rozum. “It would be challenging for us to find outside help, and the robots keep things running smoothly.” The robots also add sustainability to small dairy farms, and not just in the short term. “Growing up on the farm, we experienced the hard work, and we saw what that commitment did to our parents,” Rozum explains. “It’s a very tough lifestyle. Having the robots take over a little bit of that has made dairy farming more appealing to our generation.”
</p><p><span data-rm-shortcode-id="c22f75ac2236f457c18ecd55f872ca53"><iframe frameborder="0" height="auto" type="lazy-iframe" scrolling="no" data-runner-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vZY8TbBoDd0?rel=0&amp;start=147" width="100%"></iframe></span><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Takes Dairy Farm</small></p><p>
	Of the 25,000 dairy farms in the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/united-states">United States</a>, Endres estimates about 10 percent have robots. This is 
	<a href="https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/milking-robots-market" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about a third of the adoption rate in Europe</a>, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Farms_and_farmland_in_the_European_Union_-_statistics" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">where farms tend to be smaller</a>, so the cost of implementing the robots is lower. Endres says that over the last five years, she’s seen a shift toward robot adoption at larger farms with over 500 cows, due primarily to labor shortages. “These larger dairies are having difficulty finding employees who want to milk cows—it’s a very tedious job. And the robot is always consistent. The farmers tell me, ‘My robot never calls in sick, and never shows up drunk.’ ”
</p><p>
	Endres is skeptical of Lely’s claim that its robots are responsible for increased milk production. “There is no research that proves that cows will be more productive just because of robots,” she says. It may be true that farms that add robots do see increased milk production, she adds, but it’s difficult to measure the direct effect that the robots have. “I have many dairies that I work with where they have both a robotic milking system and a conventional milking system, and if they are managing their cows well, there isn’t a lot of difference in milk production.”

It’s also relaxing and enjoyable, so cows will brush themselves several times a day.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Lely</small></p><p>
	The robots do seem to improve the cows’ lives, however. “Welfare is not just productivity and health—it’s also the affective state, the ability to have a more natural life,” Endres says. “Again, it’s hard to measure, but I think that on most of these robot farms, their affective state is improved.” The cows’ relationship with humans changes too, comments Endres. When the cows no longer associate humans with being told where to go and what to do all the time, they’re 
	<a href="https://youtu.be/sjmflKg-v2o?t=2633" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">much more relaxed and friendly</a> toward people they meet. Rozum agrees. “We’ve noticed a tremendous change in our cows’ demeanor. They’re more calm and relaxed, just doing their thing in the barn. They’re much more comfortable when they can choose what to do.”
</p><h2>Cows Versus Robots</h2><p>
	Cows are curious and clever <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/animals">animals</a>, and have the same instinct that humans have when confronted with a new robot: They want to play with it. Because of this, Lely has had to cow-proof its robots, modifying their design and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/programming">programming</a> so that the machines can function autonomously around cows. Like many <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/mobile-robots">mobile robots</a>, Lely’s dairy robots include contact-sensing bumpers that will pause the robot’s motion if it runs into something. On the Vector feeding robot, Lely product engineer 
	<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/beltman42/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">René Beltman</a> tells me, they had to add a software option to disable the bumper. “The cows learned that, ‘oh, if I just push the bumper, then the robot will stop and put down more feed in my area for me to eat.’ It was a free buffet. So you don’t want the cows to end up controlling the robot.” Emergency stop buttons had to be relocated so that they couldn’t be pressed by questing cow tongues.
</p><p>
	There’s also a social component to cow-robot interaction. Within their herd, cows have a well-established hierarchy, and the robots need to work within this hierarchy to do their jobs. For example, a cow won’t move out of the way if it thinks that another cow is lower in the hierarchy than it is, and it will treat a robot the same way. The engineers had to figure out how the Discovery Collector could drive back and forth to vacuum up manure without getting blocked by cows. “In our early tests, we’d use sensors to have the robot stop to avoid running into any of the cows,” explains Jacobs. “But that meant that the robot became the weakest one in the hierarchy, and it would just end up crying in the corner because the cows wouldn’t move for it. So now, it doesn’t stop.”

	“We make the robot drive slower for the first week, when it’s being introduced to a new herd,” adds Beltman. “That gives the cows time to figure out that the robot is at the top of the hierarchy.”
</p><p>
	Besides maintaining their dominance at the top of the herd, the current generation of Lely robots doesn’t interact much with the cows, but that’s changing, Jacobs tells me. Right now, when a robot is driving through the barn, it makes a beeping sound to let the cows know it’s coming. Lely is looking into how to make these sounds more enjoyable for the cows. “This was a recent revelation for me,” Jacobs says. ”We’re not just designing interactions for humans. The cows are our users, too.”
</p><h2>Human-Robot Interaction</h2><p>
	Last year, Jacobs and researchers from <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/delft-university-of-technology">Delft University of Technology</a>, in the Netherlands, 
	<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10660792" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">presented a paper</a> at the IEEE Human-Robot Interaction (<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/hri">HRI</a>) Conference exploring this concept of robot behavior development on working dairy farms. The researchers visited robotic dairies, interviewed dairy farmers, and held workshops within Lely to establish a robot code of conduct—a guide that Lely’s designers and engineers use when considering how their robots should look, sound, and act, for the benefit of both humans and cows. On the engineering side, this includes practical things like colors and patterns for lights and different types of sounds so that information is communicated consistently across platforms.
</p><p>
	But there’s much more nuance to making a robot seem “reliable” or “friendly” to the end user, since such things are not only difficult to define but also difficult to implement in a way that’s appropriate for dairy farmers, who prioritize functionality.
</p><p>
	Jacobs doesn’t want his robots to try to be anyone’s friend—not the cow’s, and not the farmer’s. “The robot is an employee, and it should have a professional relationship,” he says. “So the robot might say ‘Hi,’ but it wouldn’t say, ‘How are you feeling today?’ ” What’s more important is that the robots are trustworthy. For Jacobs, instilling trust is simple: “You cannot gain trust by doing tricks. If your robot is reliable and predictable, people will trust it.”

	The real challenge, Jacobs explains, is that Lely is largely on its own when it comes to finding the best way of integrating its robots into the daily lives of people who may have never thought they’d have robot employees. “There’s not that much knowledge in the robot world about how to approach these problems,” Jacobs says. “We’re working with almost 20,000 farmers who have a bigger robot workforce than a human workforce. They’re robot managers. And I don’t know that there necessarily are other companies that have a customer base of normal people who have strategic dependence on robots for their livelihood. That is where we are now.”
</p><h2>From Dairy Farmers to Robot Managers</h2><p><span>With the additional time and flexibility that the robots enable, some dairy farmers have been able to diversify. On our way back to Lely’s headquarters, we stop at </span><a href="https://boerderijhetlansingerland.nl/melkveebedrijf/" target="_blank">Farm Het Lansingerland</a><span>, owned by a Lely customer who has added a small restaurant and farm shop to his dairy. Large windows look into the barn so that restaurant patrons can watch the robots at work, caring for the cows that produce the cheese that’s on the menu. A self-guided tour takes you right up next to an Astronaut A5 milking robot, while signs on the floor warn of Vector feeding robots on the move. “This farmer couldn’t expand—this was as many cows as he’s allowed to have here,” Jacobs explains to me over cheese sandwiches. “So, he needs to have additional income streams. That’s why he started these other things. And the robots were essential for that.”</span></p><p>
	The farmer is an early adopter—someone who’s excited about the technology and actively interested in the robots themselves. But most of Lely’s tens of thousands of customers just want a reliable robotic employee, not a science project. “We help the farmer to prepare not just the environment for the robots, but also the mind,” explains Jacobs. “It’s a complete shift in their way of working.”
</p><p>
	Besides managing the robots, the farmer must also learn to manage the massive amount of data that the robots generate about the cows. “The amount of data we get from the robots is a game changer,” says Rozum. “We can track milk production, health, and cow habits in real time. But it’s overwhelming. You could spend all day just sitting at the computer, looking at data and not get anything else done. It took us probably a year to really learn how to use it.”
</p><p>
	The most significant advantages to farmers come from using the data for long-term optimization, says the University of Minnesota’s Endres. “In a conventional barn, the cows are treated as a group,” she says. “But the robots are collecting data about individual animals, which lets us manage them as individuals.” By combining data from a milking robot and a feeding robot, for example, farmers can close the loop, correlating when and how the cows are fed with their milk production. Lely is doing its best to simplify this type of decision making, says Jacobs. “You need to understand what the data means, and then you need to present it to the farmer in an actionable way.”

All dairy farms are different, and farms that decide to give robots a try will often start with just one or two. A highly roboticized dairy barn might look something like this illustration, with a team of many different robots working together to keep the cows comfortable and happy.
</h3><p>
	A: One Astronaut A5 robot can milk up to 60 cows. After the Astronaut cleans the teats, a laser sensor guides a robotic arm to attach the teat cups. Milking takes just a few minutes.
</p><p>
	B: In the feed <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/kitchen">kitchen</a>, the Vector robot recharges itself while different ingredients are loaded into its hopper and mixed together. Mixtures can be customized for different groups of cows.
</p><p>
	C: The Vector robot dispenses freshly mixed food in small batches throughout the day. A laser measures the height of leftover food to make sure that the cows are getting the right amounts.
</p><p>
	D: The Discovery Collector is a mop and vacuum for cow manure. It navigates the barn autonomously and returns to its docking station to remove waste, refill water, and wirelessly recharge.</p><p>
	E: As it milks, the Astronaut is collecting a huge amount of data—32 different parameters per teat. If it detects an issue, the farmer is notified, helping to catch health problems early.</p><p>
	F: Automated gates control meadow access and will keep a cow inside if she’s due to be milked soon. Cows are identified using <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/rfid">RFID</a> collars, which also track their behavior and health.
</p></div><h2>A Sensible Future for Dairy Robots</h2><p>
	After lunch, we stop by Lely headquarters, where bright red life-size cow statues guard the entrance and all of the conference rooms are dairy themed. We get comfortable in Butter, and I ask Jacobs and Beltman what the future holds for their dairy robots.
</p><p>
	In the near term, Lely is focused on making its existing robots more capable. Its latest 
	<a href="https://www.lely.com/us/press/2024/09/10/lely-introduces-autonomous-feed-pushing-robot-for/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">feed-pushing robot</a> is equipped with <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/lidar">lidar</a> and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/stereo-cameras">stereo cameras</a>, which allow it to autonomously navigate around large farms without needing to follow a metal strip bolted to the ground. A new <a href="https://www.lely.com/us/press/2024/09/10/lely-zeta-the-start-of-a-new-chapter-in-dairy-farm/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">overhead camera system</a> will leverage AI to recognize individual cows and track their behavior, while also providing farmers with an enormous new dataset that could allow Lely’s systems to help farmers make more nuanced decisions about cow welfare. The potential of AI is what Jacobs seems most excited about, although he’s cautious as well. “With AI, we’re suddenly going to take away an entirely different level of work. So, we’re thinking about doing research into the meaningfulness of work, to make sure that the things that we do with AI are the things that farmers <em><em>want</em></em> us to do with AI.”
</p><p>
	“The idea of AI is very intriguing,” comments Rozum. “I think AI could help to simplify things for farmers. It would be a tool, a resource. But we know our cows best, and a farmer’s judgment has to be there too. There’s just some component of dairy farming that you cannot take the human out of. Robots are not going to be successful on a farm unless you have good farmers.”
</p><p>
	Lely is aware of this and knows that its robots have to find the right balance between being helpful, and taking over. “We want to make sure not to take away the kinds of interactions that give dairy farmers joy in their work,” says Beltman. “Like feeding calves—every farmer likes to feed the calves.” Lely does sell an 
	<a href="https://www.lely.com/us/solutions/feeding/calm/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">automated calf feeder</a> that many dairy farmers buy, which illustrates the point: What’s the best way of designing robots to give humans the flexibility to do the work that they enjoy?
</p><p>
	“This is where <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/robotics/">robotics</a> is going,” Jacobs tells me as he gives me a lift to the train station. “As a human, you could have two other humans and six robots, and that’s your company.” Many industries, he says, look to robots with the objective of minimizing human involvement as much as possible so that the robots can generate the maximum amount of value for whoever happens to be in charge.
</p><p>
	Dairy farms are different. Perhaps that’s because the person buying the robot is the person who most directly benefits from it. But I wonder if the concern over automation of jobs would be mitigated if more companies chose to emphasize the sustainability and joy of work equally with profit. Automation doesn’t have to be zero-sum—if implemented thoughtfully, perhaps robots can make work easier, more efficient, and more fun, too.
</p><p>
	Jacobs certainly thinks so. “That’s my utopia,” he says. “And we’re working in the right direction.”

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><em>Cross-compiling</em> is taking a computer program and compiling it for a machine that isn’t the one hosting the compilation. Although historically compilers would only compile for the host machine, this is considered an anachronism: all serious native compilers are now cross-compilers.</p> <p>After all, you don’t want to be building your iPhone app on literal iPhone hardware.</p> <p>Many different compilers have different mechanisms for classifying and identifying <em>targets</em>. A target is a platform that the compiler can produce executable code for. However, due to the runaway popularity of LLVM, virtually all compilers now use <em>target triples</em>. You may have already encountered one, such as the venerable <code>x86_64-unknown-linux</code>, or the evil <code>x86_64-pc-windows</code>. This system is convoluted and <em>almost</em> self-consistent.</p> <p>But what is a target triple, and where did they come from?</p> <h2 id="stupid-gcc-conventions"><a href="#stupid-gcc-conventions">Stupid GCC Conventions</a></h2> <p>So if you go poking around the <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Target_Triplet">Target Triplet</a> page on OSDev, you will learn both true and false things about target triples, because this page is about GCC, not native compilers in general.</p> <blockquote> <p>Generally, there is no “ground truth” for what a target triple is. There isn’t some standards body that assigns these names. But as we’ll see, LLVM is the trendsetter.</p> </blockquote> <p>If you run the following command you can learn the target triple for your machine:</p> <div><figure><pre><code data-lang="console"><span>$</span><span> </span>gcc <span>-dumpmachine</span>
<span>x86_64-linux-gnu</span></code></pre></figure></div> <p>Now if you’re at all familiar with any system that makes pervasive use of target triples, you will know that this is <em>not a target triple</em>, because this target’s name is <code>x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu</code>, which is what both <code>clang</code> and <code>rustc</code> call-</p> <div><figure><pre><code data-lang="console"><span>$</span><span> </span>clang <span>-dumpmachine</span>

<span>host: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu</span></code></pre></figure></div> <p>Oh no.</p> <p>Well, GCC is missing the the <code>pc</code> or <code>unknown</code> component, and that’s specifically a GCC thing; it allows omitting parts of the triple in such a way that is unambiguous. And they are a GCC invention, so perhaps it’s best to start by assessing GCC’s beliefs.</p> <p>According to GCC, a target triple is a string of the form <code>&lt;machine&gt;-&lt;vendor&gt;-&lt;os&gt;</code>. The “machine” part unambiguously identifies the architecture of the system. Practically speaking, this is the assembly language that the compiler will output at the end. The “vendor” part is essentially irrelevant, and mostly is of benefit for sorting related operating systems together. Finally, the “os” part identifies the operating system that this code is being compiled for. The main thing this identifies for a compiler is the executable format: COFF/PE for Windows, Mach-O for Apple’s operating systems, ELF for Linux and friends, and so on (this, however, is an oversimplification).</p> <p>But you may notice that <code>x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu</code> has an extra, fourth entry<sup id="fnref:quad" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:quad" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, which plays many roles but is most often called the target’s “ABI”. For <code>linux</code>, it identifies the target’s libc, which has consequences for code generation of some language features, such as thread locals and unwinding. It is optional, since many targets only have one ABI.</p> <h3 id="cross-compiling-with-gcc"><a href="#cross-compiling-with-gcc">Cross Compiling with GCC</a></h3> <p>A critical piece of history here is to understand the really stupid way in which GCC does cross compiling. Traditionally, each GCC binary would be built for <em>one</em> target triple. The full name of a GCC binary would include the triple, so when cross-compiling, you would compile with <code>x86_64-unknown-linux-gcc</code>, link with <code>x86_64-unknown-linux-ld</code>, and so on (here, <code>gcc</code> is not the fourth ABI component of a triple; it’s just one of the tools in the <code>x86_64-unknown-linux</code> toolchain).</p> <p>Nobody with a brain does this<sup id="fnref:toolchain" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:toolchain" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. LLVM and all cross compilers that follow it instead put all of the backends in one binary, and use a compiler flag like <code>--target</code> to select the backend.</p> <p>But regardless, this is where target triples come from, and why they look the way they look: they began as prefixes for the names of binaries in <code>autoconf</code> scripts.</p> <p>But GCC is ancient technology. In the 21st century, LLVM rules all native compilers.</p> <h2 id="names-in-the-ancient-language"><a href="#names-in-the-ancient-language">Names in the Ancient Language</a></h2> <p>LLVM’s target triple list is the one that should be regarded as “most official”, for a few reasons:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Inertia. Everyone and their mother uses LLVM as a middleend and backend, so its naming conventions bubble up into language frontends like <code>clang</code>, <code>rustc</code> <code>swiftc</code>, <code>icc</code>, and <code>nvcc</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Upstream work by silicon and operating system vendors. LLVM is what people get hired to work on for the most part, not GCC, so its platform-specific conventions often reflect the preferences of vendors.</p> </li> </ol> <p>These are in no small part because Apple, Google, and Nvidia have armies of compiler engineers contributing to LLVM.</p> <p>The sources for “official” target triples are many. Generally, I would describe a target triple as “official” when:</p> <ol> <li> <p>A major compiler (so, <code>clang</code> or <code>rustc</code>) uses it. Rust does a way better job than LLVM of documenting their targets, so I prefer to give it deference. You can find Rust’s official triples <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/platform-support.html">here</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>A platform developer (e.g., a hardware manufacturer, OS vendor) distributes a toolchain with a target triple in the <code>arch-vendor-os</code> format.</p> </li> </ol> <p>So, what are the names in class (1)? LLVM does not really go out of its way to provide such a list. But we gotta start somewhere, so source-diving it is.</p> <p>We can dig into <a href="https://llvm.org/doxygen/Triple_8cpp_source.html"><code>Triple.cpp</code></a> in LLVM’s target triple parser. It lists all of the names LLVM recognizes for each part of a triple. Looking at <code>Triple::parseArch()</code>, we have the following names, including many, many aliases. The first item on the right column is LLVM’s preferred name for the architecture, as indicated by <code>Triple::getArchTypeName()</code>.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Architecture</th> <th>Possible

They are <em>hell</em>. Where a list of architecture names contains a “…”, it means that LLVM accepts many more names.</p> <p>The problem is that architectures often have <em>versions</em> and <em>features</em>, which subtly change how the compiler generates code. For example, when compiling for an <code>x86_64</code>, we may want to specify that we want AVX512 instructions to be used. On LLVM, you might do that with <code>-mattr=+avx512</code>. Every architecture has a subtly-different way of doing this, because every architecture had a <em>different GCC</em>! Each variant of GCC would put different things behind <code>-mXXX</code> flags (<code>-m</code> for “machine”), meaning that the interface is not actually that uniform. The meanings of <code>-march</code>, <code>-mcpu</code>, <code>-mtune</code>, and <code>-mattr</code> thus vary wildly for this reason.</p> <p>Because LLVM is supposed to replace GCC (for the most part), it replicates a lot of this wacky behavior.</p> <p>So uh, we gotta talk about 32-bit ARM architecture names.</p> <h3 id="armtargetparsercpp"><a href="#armtargetparsercpp"><code>ARMTargetParser.cpp</code></a></h3> <p>There is a hellish file in LLVM dedicated to parsing ARM architecture names. Although members of the ARM family have many configurable features (which you can discover with <code>llc -march aarch64 -mattr help</code><sup id="fnref:llc" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:llc" rel="footnote">10</a></sup>), the name of the architecture is somewhat meaningful, and can hav many options, mostly relating to the many versions of ARM that exist.</p> <p>How bad is it? Well, we can look at all of the various ARM targets that <code>rustc</code> supports with <code>rustc --print target-list</code>:</p> <div><figure><pre><code data-lang="console"><span>$</span><span> </span>rustc <span>--print</span> target-list | <span>grep</span> <span>-P</span> <span>'arm|aarch|thumb'</span> <span>\</span>

These correspond to the names given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family#Cores">here</a>. Why does ARM stick version numbers in the architecture name, instead of using <code>-mcpu</code> like you would on x86 (e.g. <code>-mcpu alderlake</code>)? I have no idea, because ARM is not my strong suit. It’s likely because of how early ARM support was added to GCC.</p> <p>Internally, LLVM calls these “subarchitectures”, although ARM gets special handling because there’s so many variants. SPIR-V, Direct X, and MIPS all have subarchitectures, so you might see something like <code>dxilv1.7</code> if you’re having a bad day.</p> <p>Of course, LLVM’s ARM support also sports some naughty subarchitectures not part of this system, with naughty made up names.</p> <ul> <li> <p><code>arm64e</code> is an Apple thing, which is an enhancement of <code>aarch64</code> present on some Apple hardware, which adds their own flavor of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/preparing-your-app-to-work-with-pointer-authentication">pointer authentication</a> and some other features.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>arm64ec</code> is a completely unrelated Microsoft invention that is essentially “<code>aarch64</code> but with an <code>x86_64</code>-ey ABI” to make <code>x86_64</code> emulation on what would otherwise be <code>aarch64-pc-windows-msvc</code> target somewhat more amenable.</p> </li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>Why the Windows people invented a whole other ABI instead of making things clean and simple like Apple did with Rosetta on ARM MacBooks? I have no idea, but <a href="http://www.emulators.com/docs/abc_arm64ec_explained.htm">http://www.emulators.com/docs/abc_arm64ec_explained.htm</a> contains various excuses, none of which I am impressed by. My read is that their compiler org was just worse at life than Apple’s, which is not surprising, since Apple does compilers better than anyone else in the business.</p> </blockquote> <p>Actually, since we’re on the topic of the names of architectures, I have a few things I need to straighten out.</p> <h3 id="made-up-names-of-architectures"><a href="#made-up-names-of-architectures">Made Up Names of Architectures</a></h3> <p>x86 and ARM both seem to attract a lot of people making up nicknames for them, which leads to a lot of confusion in:</p> <ol> <li> <p>What the “real” name is.</p> </li> <li> <p>What name a particular toolchain wants.</p> </li> <li> <p>What name you should use in your own cosmopolitan tooling.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Let’s talk about the incorrect names people like to make up for them. Please consider the following a relatively normative reference on what people call these architectures, based on my own experience with many tools.</p> <p>When we say “x86” unqualified, in 2025, we almost always mean <code>x86_64</code>, because 32-bit x86 is dead. If you need to talk about 32-bit x86, you should either say “32-bit x86”, “protected mode”<sup id="fnref:x86-modes" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:x86-modes" rel="footnote">11</a></sup>, or “i386” (the first Intel microarchitecture that implemented protected mode)<sup id="fnref:i386" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:i386" rel="footnote">12</a></sup>. You should not call it <code>x86_32</code> or just <code>x86</code>.</p> <p>You might also call it IA-32 for Intel Architecture 32, (or <code>ia32</code>), but nobody calls it that and you risk confusing people with <code>ia64</code>, or IA-64, the official name of Intel’s failed general-purpose VLIW architecture, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itanium">Itanium</a>, which is in no way compatible with x86. <code>ia64</code> was what GCC and LLVM named Itanium triples with. Itanium support was drowned in a bathtub during the Obama administration, so it’s not really relevant anymore. Rust has never had official Itanium support.</p> <p>32-bit x86 is <em>extremely not</em> called “x32”; this is what Linux used to call its x86 ILP32<sup id="fnref:ilp32:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ilp32" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> variant before it was removed (which, following the ARM names, would have been called <code>x86_6432</code>).</p> <p>There are also many ficticious names for 64-bit x86, which you should avoid unless you want the younger generation to make fun of you. <code>amd64</code> refers to AMD’s original implementation of long mode in their K8 microarchitecture, first shipped in their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athlon_64">Athlon 64</a> product. AMD still makes the best x86 chips (I am writing this on a machine socketed with a Zen2 Threadripper), sure, but calling it <code>amd64</code> is silly and also looks a lot like <code>arm64</code>, and I am honestly kinda annoyed at how much Go code I’ve seen with files named <code>fast_arm64.s</code> and <code>fast_amd64.s</code>. Debian also uses <code>amd64</code>/<code>arm64</code>, which makes browsing packages kind of annoying.</p> <p>On that topic, you should <em>absolutely not</em> call 64-bit mode <code>k8</code>, after the AMD K8. Nobody except for weird computer taxonomists like me know what that is. But Bazel calls it that, and it’s really irritating<sup id="fnref:piii" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:piii" rel="footnote">13</a></sup>.</p> <p>You should also not call it <code>x64</code>. Although LLVM does accept <code>amd64</code> for historical purposes, no one calls it <code>x64</code> except for Microsoft. And even though it is fairly prevalent on Windows, I absolutely give my gamedev friends a hard time when they write <code>x64</code>.</p> <p>On the ARM side, well. Arm<sup id="fnref:arm-holdings" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:arm-holdings" rel="footnote">14</a></sup> has a bad habit of not using consistent naming for 64-bit ARM, since they used both AArch64 and ARM64 for it. However, in compiler land, <code>aarch64</code> appears to be somewhat more popular.</p> <p>You should also probably stick to the LLVM names for the various architectures, instead of picking your favorite Arm Cortex name (like <code>cortex_m0</code>).</p> <h2 id="vendors-and-operating-systems"><a href="#vendors-and-operating-systems">Vendors and Operating Systems</a></h2> <p>The worst is over. Let’s now move onto examinining the rest of the triple: the platform vendor, and the operating system.</p> <p>The vendor is intended to identify who is responsible for the ABI definition for that target. Although provides little to no value to the compiler itself, but it does help to sort related targets together. Sort of.</p> <p>Returning to <code>llvm::Triple</code>, we can examine <code>Triple::VendorType</code>. Vendors almost always correspond to companies which develop operating systems or other platforms that code runs on, with some exceptions.</p> <p>We can also get the vendors that <code>rustc</code> knows about with a handy dandy command:</p> <div><figure><pre><code data-lang="console"><span>rustc --print target-list | grep -P '\w+-\w+-' | cut -d- -f2 | sort | uniq</span></code></pre></figure></div> <p>The result is this.

For example <code>suse</code> and <code>redhat</code> are used for those organizations’ Linux distributions, as a funny branding thing. Some vendors are projects, like the <code>mesa</code> vendor used with the Mesa3D OpenGL implementation’s triples.</p> <p>The <code>unknown</code> vendor is used for cases where the vendor is not specified or just not important. For example, the canonical Linux triple is <code>x86_64-unknown-linux</code>… although one could argue it should be <code>x86_64-torvalds-linux</code>. It is not uncommon for companies that sell/distribute Linux distributions to have their own target triples, as do SUSE and sometimes RedHat. Notably, there are no triples with a <code>google</code> vendor, even though <code>aarch64-linux-android</code> and <code>aarch64-unknown-fuchsia</code> should really be called <code>aarch64-google-linux-android</code> and <code>aarch64-google-fuchsia</code>. The target triple system begins to show cracks here.</p> <p>The <code>pc</code> vendor is a bit weirder, and is mostly used by Windows targets. The standard Windows target is <code>x86_64-pc-windows-msvc</code>, but really it should have been <code>x86_64-microsoft-windows-msvc</code>. This is likely complicated by the fact that there is also a <code>x86_64-pc-windows-gnu</code> triple, which is for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinGW">MinGW</a> code. This platform, despite running on Windows, is not provided by Microsoft, so it would probably make more sense to be called <code>x86_64-unknown-windows-gnu</code>.</p> <p>But not all Windows targets are <code>pc</code>! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Windows_Platform">UWP</a> apps use a different triple, that replaces the <code>pc</code> with <code>uwp</code>. <code>rustc</code> provides targets for Windows 7 backports that use a <code>win7</code> “vendor”.</p> <h3 id="beyond-operating-systems"><a href="#beyond-operating-systems">Beyond Operating Systems</a></h3> <p>The third (or sometimes second, ugh) component of a triple is the operating system, or just “system”, since it’s much more general than that. The main thing that compilers get from this component relates to generating code to interact with the operating system (e.g. SEH on Windows) and various details related to linking, such as object file format and relocations.</p> <p>It’s also used for setting defines like <code>__linux__</code> in C, which user code can use to determine what to do based on the target.</p> <p>We’ve seen <code>linux</code> and <code>windows</code>, but you may have also seen <code>x86_64-apple-darwin</code>. <em>Darwin?</em></p> <p>The operating system formerly known as Mac OS X (now macOS<sup id="fnref:macos" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:macos" rel="footnote">16</a></sup>) is a POSIX operating system. The POSIX substrate that all the Apple-specific things are built on top of is called Darwin. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_(operating_system)">Darwin</a> is a free and open source operating system based on Mach, a research kernel whose name survives in Mach-O, the object file format used by all Apple products.</p> <p>All of the little doodads Apple sells use the actual official names of their OSes, like <code>aarch64-apple-ios</code>. For, you know, iOS. On your iPhone. Built with Xcode on your iMac.</p> <p><code>none</code> is a common value for this entry, which usually means a free-standing environment with no operating system. The object file format is usually specified in the fourth entry of the triple, so you might see something like <code>riscv32imc-unknown-none-elf</code>.</p> <p>Sometimes the triple refers not to an operating system, but to a complete hardware product. This is common with game console triples, which have “operating system” names like <code>ps4</code>, <code>psvita</code>, <code>3ds</code>, and <code>switch</code>. (Both Sony and Nintendo use LLVM as the basis for their internal toolchains; the Xbox toolchain is just MSVC).</p> <h2 id="abi-abi"><a href="#abi-abi">ABI! ABI!</a></h2> <p>The fourth entry of the triple (and I repeat myself, yes, it’s still a triple) represents the binary interface for the target, when it is ambiguous.</p> <p>For example, Apple targets never have this, because on an Apple platform, you just shut up and use <code>CoreFoundation.framework</code> as your libc. Except this isn’t true, because of things like <code>x86_64-apple-ios-sim</code>, the iOS simulator running on an x86 host.</p> <p>On the other hand, Windows targets will usually specify <code>-msvc</code> or <code>-gnu</code>, to indicate whether they are built to match MSVC’s ABI or MinGW. Linux targets will usually specify the libc vendor in this position: <code>-gnu</code> for glibc, <code>-musl</code> for musl, <code>-newlib</code> for newlib, and so on.</p> <p>This doesn’t just influence the calling convention; it also influences how language features, such as thread locals and dynamic linking, are handled. This usually requires coordination with the target libc.</p> <p>On ARM free-standing (<code>armxxx-unknown-none</code>) targets, <code>-eabi</code> specifies the ARM EABI, which is a standard embeded ABI for ARM. <code>-eabihf</code> is similar, but indicates that no soft float support is necessary (<code>hf</code> stands for hardfloat). (Note that Rust does not include a vendor with these architectures, so they’re more like <code>armv7r-none-eabi</code>).</p> <p>A lot of jankier targets use the ABI portion to specify the object file, such as the aforementioned <code>riscv32imc-unknown-none-elf</code>.</p> <h2 id="wasm-targets"><a href="#wasm-targets">WASM Targets</a></h2> <p>One last thing to note are the various WebAssembly targets, which completely ignore all of the above conventions. Their triples often only have two components (they are still called triples, hopefully I’ve made that clear by now). Rust is a little bit more on the forefront here than <code>clang</code> (and anyways I don’t want to get into Emscripten) so I’ll stick to what’s going on in <code>rustc</code>.</p> <p>There’s a few variants. <code>wasm32-unknown-unknown</code> (here using <code>unknown</code> instead of <code>none</code> as the system, oops) is a completely bare WebAssebly runtime where none of the standard library that needs to interact with the outside world works. This is essentially for building WebAssembly modules to deploy in a browser.</p> <p>There are also the WASI targets, which provide a standard ABI for talking to the host operating system. These are less meant for browsers and more for people who are using WASI as a security boundary. These have names like <code>wasm32-wasip1</code>, which, unusually, lack a vendor! A “more correct” formulation would have been <code>wasm32-unknown-wasip1</code>.</p> <h2 id="aside-on-go"><a href="#aside-on-go">Aside on Go</a></h2> <p>Go does the correct thing and distributes a cross compiler. This is well and good.</p> <p>Unfortunately, they decided to be different and special and do not use the target triple system for naming their targets. Instead, you set the <code>GOARCH</code> and <code>GOOS</code> environment variables before invoking <code>gc</code>. This will sometimes be shown printed with a slash between, such as <code>linux/amd64</code>.</p> <p>Thankfully, they at least provide documentation for a relevant internal package <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/internal/platform">here</a>, which offers the names of various <code>GOARCH</code> and <code>GOOS</code> values.</p> <p>They use completely different names from everyone else for a few things, which is guaranteed to trip you up. They use call the 32- and 64-bit variants of x86 <code>386</code> (note the lack of leading <code>i</code>) and <code>amd64</code>. They call 64-bit ARM <code>arm64</code>, instead of <code>aarch64</code>. They call little-endian MIPSes <code>mipsle</code> instead of <code>mipsel</code>.</p> <p>They also call 32-bit WebAssembly <code>wasm</code> instead of <code>wasm32</code>, which is a bit silly, and they use <code>js/wasm</code> as their equivalent of <code>wasm32-unknown-unknown</code>, which is <em>very</em> silly.</p> <p>Android is treated as its own operating system, <code>android</code>, rather than being <code>linux</code> with a particular ABI; their system also can’t account for ABI variants in general, since Go originally wanted to not have to link any system libraries, something that does not actually work.</p> <p>If you are building a new toolchain, don’t be clever by inventing a cute target triple convention. All you’ll do is annoy people who need to work with a lot of different toolchains by being different and special.</p> <h2 id="inventing-your-own-triples"><a href="#inventing-your-own-triples">Inventing Your Own Triples</a></h2> <p>Realistically, you probably shouldn’t. But if you must, you should probably figure out what you want out of the triple.</p> <p>Odds are there isn’t anything interesting to put in the vendor field, so you will avoid people a lot of pain by picking <code>unknown</code>. Just include a vendor to avoid pain for people in the future.</p> <p>You should also avoid inventing a new name for an existing architecture. Don’t name your hobby operating system’s triple <code>amd64-unknown-whatever</code>, please. And you definitely don’t want to have an ABI component. One ABI is enough.</p> <p>If you’re inventing a triple for a free-standing environment, but want to specify something about the hardware configuration, you’re probably gonna want to use <code>-none-&lt;abi&gt;</code> for your system. For some firmware use-cases, though, the system entry is a better place, such as for the UEFI triples. Although, I have unforunately seen both <code>x86_64-unknown-uefi</code> and <code>x86_64-pc-none-uefi</code> in the wild.</p> <p>And most imporantly: this sytem was built up organically. Disabuse yourself now of the idea that the system is consistent and that target triples are easy to parse. Trying to parse them will make you very sad.</p>  </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-8805">
				
<p>Every week, I tell myself I won’t do yet another post about the asteroid striking American academia, and then every week events force my hand otherwise.</p>



<p>No one on earth—<em>certainly</em> no one who reads this blog—could call me blasé about the issue of antisemitism at US universities.  I’ve blasted the takeover of entire departments and unrelated student clubs and campus common areas by the dogmatic belief that the State of Israel (and <em>only</em> Israel, among all nations on earth) should be eradicated, by the use of that belief as a litmus test for entry.  Since October 7, I’ve dealt with comments and emails pretty much every day calling me a genocidal Judeofascist Zionist.</p>



<p>So I hope it means something when I say: <em>today I salute Harvard for standing up to the Trump administration</em>. And I’ll say so in person, when I visit Harvard’s math department later this week to give the <a href="https://cmsa.fas.harvard.edu/event/yip-2025/">Fifth Annual Yip Lecture</a>, on “How Much Math Is Knowable?”  The more depressing the news, I find, the more my thoughts turn to the same questions that bothered Euclid and Archimedes and Leibniz and Russell and Turing.  Actually, what the hell, why don’t I share the abstract for this talk?</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Theoretical computer science has over the years sought more and more refined answers to the question of which mathematical&nbsp;truths are knowable by finite beings like ourselves,&nbsp;bounded in time and space and subject to physical laws.&nbsp; I’ll tell a story that starts with Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem and Turing’s discovery of uncomputability.&nbsp; I’ll then introduce the spectacular Busy Beaver function, which grows faster than any computable function.&nbsp; Work by me and Yedidia, along with recent improvements by O’Rear and Riebel, has shown that the value of BB(745) is independent of the axioms of set theory; on the other end, an international collaboration proved last year that BB(5) = 47,176,870.&nbsp; I’ll speculate on whether BB(6) will ever be known,&nbsp;by us or our AI successors.&nbsp; I’ll next discuss the P≠NP conjecture and what it&nbsp;does and doesn’t mean for the limits of machine&nbsp;intelligence.&nbsp; As my own specialty is quantum computing,&nbsp;I’ll summarize what we know about how scalable quantum computers, assuming we get&nbsp;them,&nbsp;will expand the&nbsp;boundary of what’s mathematically knowable.&nbsp; I’ll end by talking about hypothetical models even beyond quantum computers, which might expand the boundary of knowability still&nbsp;further, if one is able (for example) to jump into a black hole, create a closed timelike curve, or project oneself onto the holographic boundary of the universe.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Now back to the depressing news.  What makes me take Harvard’s side is the experience of Columbia. Columbia had already been moving in the right direction on fighting antisemitism, and on enforcing its rules against disruption, before the government even got involved.  Then, once the government <em>did</em> take away funding and present its ultimatum—completely outside the process specified in Title VI law—Columbia’s administration quickly agreed to everything asked, to howls of outrage from the left-leaning faculty. Yet <strong>despite its total capitulation,</strong> the government has <em>continued</em> to hold Columbia’s medical research and other science funding hostage, while inventing a never-ending list of additional demands, whose apparent endpoint is that Columbia submit to state ideological control like a university in Russia or Iran.</p>



<p>By taking this scorched-earth route, the government has effectively telegraphed to all the <em>other</em> universities, as clearly as possible: “actually, we don’t care what you do or don’t do on antisemitism. We just want to destroy you, and antisemitism was our best available pretext, the place where you’d most obviously fallen short of your ideals. But we’re not really trying to cure a sick patient, or force the patient to adopt better health habits: we’re trying to shoot, disembowel, and dismember the patient. That being the case, you might as well fight us and go down with dignity!”</p>



<p>No wonder that my distinguished Harvard friends (and past <em>Shtetl-Optimized</em> guest bloggers) <a href="https://x.com/sapinker/status/1911984035263393798">Steven Pinker</a> and <a href="https://x.com/boazbaraktcs/status/1911841870625558742">Boaz Barak</a>—not exactly known as anti-Zionist woke radicals—have come out in favor of Harvard fighting this in court.  So has Harvard’s past president <a href="https://x.com/LHSummers/status/1911839522058367129">Larry Summers</a>, who’s welcome to guest-blog here as well.  They all understand that events have given us no choice but to fight Trump as if there were no antisemitism, even while we continue to fight antisemitism as if there were no Trump.</p>

            <p>A customer asked for help with a longstanding but low-frequency hang that they have never been able to figure out. From what they could tell, their UI thread was calling into the kernel, and the call simply hung for no apparent reason. Unfortunately, the kernel dump couldn’t show a stack from user mode because the stack had been paged out. (Which makes sense, because a hung thread isn’t using its stack, so once the system is under some memory pressure, that stack gets paged out.)</p>

<p>Naturally, a suspended UI thread is going to manifest itself as a hang.</p>
<p>Functions like <code>Suspend­Thread</code> exist primarily for debuggers to use, so we asked them if they had a debugger attached to the process when they captured the kernel dump. They said that they did not.</p>
<p>So who suspended the thread, and why?</p>
<p>The customer then realized that they had a watchdog thread which monitors the UI thread for responsiveness, and every so often, it suspends the UI thread, captures a stack trace, and then resumes the UI thread. And in the dump file, they were able to observe their watchdog thread in the middle of its stack trace capturing code. But why was the stack trace capture taking five hours?</p>
<p>The stack of the watchdog thread looks like this:</p>
<pre>ntdll!ZwWaitForAlertByThreadId(void)+0x14
ntdll!RtlpAcquireSRWLockSharedContended+0x15a
ntdll!RtlpxLookupFunctionTable+0x180
ntdll!RtlLookupFunctionEntry+0x4d
contoso!GetStackTrace+0x72
contoso!GetStackTraceOfUIThread+0x127
...
</pre>
<p>Okay, so we see that the watchdog thread is trying to get a stack trace of the UI thread, but it’s hung inside <code>Rtl­Lookup­Function­Entry</code> which is waiting for a lock.</p>
<p>You know who I bet holds the lock?</p>
<p>The UI thread.</p>
<p>Which is suspended.</p>
<p>The UI thread is probably trying to dispatch an exception, which means that it is walking the stack looking for an exception handler. But in the middle of this search, it got suspended by the watchdog thread. Then the watchdog thread tries to walk the stack of the UI thread, but it can’t do that yet because the function table is locked by the UI thread’s stack walk.</p>
<p>This is a practical exam for a previous discussion: <a title="Why you should never suspend a thread" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20031209-00/?p=41573"> Why you should never suspend a thread</a>.</p>
<p>Specifically, the title should say “Why you should never suspend a thread <i>in your own process</i>.” Suspending a thread in your own process runs the risk that the thread you suspended was in possession of some resource that the rest of the program needs. In particular, it might possess a resource that is needed by the code which has responsible for eventually resuming the thread. Since it is suspended, it will never get a chance to release those resources, and you end up with a deadlock between the suspended thread and the thread whose job it is to resume that thread.</p>
<p>If you want to suspend a thread and capture stacks from it, you’ll have to do it from another process, so that you don’t deadlock with the thread you suspended.¹</p>
<p><b>Bonus chatter</b>: In this kernel stack, you can see evidence that <a title="The SuspendThread function suspends a thread, but it does so asynchronously" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20150205-00/?p=44743"> the <code>Suspend­Thread</code> operates asynchronously</a>. When the watchdog thread calls <code>Suspend­Thread</code> to suspend the UI thread, the UI thread was in the kernel, in the middle of changing memory protections. The thread does not suspend immediately, but rather waits for the kernel to finish its work, and then before returning to user mode, the kernel does a <code>Check­For­Kernel­Apc­Delivery</code> to see if there were any requests waiting. It picks up the request to suspend, and that is when the thread actually suspends.²</p>
<p><b>Bonus bonus chatter</b>: “What if the kernel delayed suspending a thread if it held any user-mode locks? Wouldn’t that avoid this problem?” First of all, how would the kernel even know whether a thread held any user-mode locks? There is no reliable signature for a user-mode lock. After all, you can make a user-mode lock out of any byte of memory by using it as a spin lock. Second, even if the kernel somehow could figure out whether a thread held a user-mode lock, you don’t want that to block thread suspension, because that would let a program make itself un-suspendable! Just call <code>AcquireSRWLockShared(some_global_srwlock)</code> and never call the corresponding <code>Release</code> function. Congratulations, the thread perpetually owns the global lock in shared mode and would therefore now be immune from suspension.</p>
<p>¹ Of course, this also requires that the code that does the suspending does not wait on cross-process resources like semaphores, mutexes, or file locks, because those might be held by the suspended thread.</p>
<p>² The kernel doesn’t suspend the thread immediately because it might be in possession of internal kernel locks, and suspending a thread while it owns a kernel lock (such as the lock that synchronizes access to the page tables) would result in the kernel itself deadlocking!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last month I asked people to <a href="https://youtu.be/gaV-O6NPWrI?t=297">hack part of my YouTube video</a>, specifically to de-pixelate the contents of a folder I had pixelated starting at the 4:57 mark.</p>

<p>For years, people have used the censor tool to blur or pixelate out parts of videos where there's sensitive information. And for years, every time I've used it, I get a few comments from people saying that's not a safe way to censor information.</p>

<p>So is that true?</p>

<p>I wanted to find out, so I put a message saying I'd send fifty bucks to anyone who could tell me what it said under the pixelation. And you know what? Less than a day later, <em>three</em> people solved it, using three slightly different techniques—scary!</p>

<p>This blog post is a lightly edited transcript of the following video:</p>

<h2>How did they do it?</h2>

<p>But how did they do it? I asked each of them, and they were more than happy to share. For most of us who like reverse-engineering or tinkering, it's fun to share the craft. And even more fun when it's <em>sanctioned</em> fun. Add on a little monetary reward, and that's just icing on the cake.</p>

<p>GitHub user KoKuToru was kind enough to share <a href="https://github.com/KoKuToru/de-pixelate_gaV-O6NPWrI">an entire GitHub repo</a> with the process and the code, along with two different ways that user tried to depixlate my footage.</p>

<p>First a <a href="https://github.com/KoKuToru/de-pixelate_gaV-O6NPWrI/tree/master/v1">brute-force attempt</a> to extract aligned images of just the window, with some code using TensorFlow to extract pixel data and aggregate it into a somewhat-fuzzy (but almost clear enough to read) picture:</p>

</p>

<p>The idea here is the pixelation is kind of like shutters over a picture. As you move the image beneath, you can peek into different parts of the picture. As long as you have a solid frame of reference, like the window that stays the same size, you can 'accumulate' pixel data from the picture underneath.</p>

<p>Due to the slight error in selecting the window by hand, the final result was slightly blotchy. For the second attempt, GIMP was used to get a better window selection algorithm with ffmpeg, and with a slight bit more data (more frames extracted), a perfectly legible result:</p>

<h2>Any way to prevent it?</h2>

<p>Blurring or pixelating video, especially <em>moving</em> video, may lead to similar results as you saw here. Years ago it would've required a supercomputer and a PhD to do this stuff. But today, between AI assistance with the trickier bits of coding, and how fast neural networks run on computers, it's easier and faster than ever to de-pixelate video!</p>

<p>If there's one thing computers are good at, it's finding order in seeming chaos, like how modern tools can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7msuhEq1Vz4">pull a clean voice out of a horrible recording</a>.</p>

<p>The more motion in the video, the more data points the reverse engineering has to play with. And thus, the better the confidence in the results.</p>

<p>If I <em>hadn't</em> moved around my Finder window in the video, I don't think it would've worked. You might get a couple letters right, but it would be very low confidence.</p>

<p>Moving forward, if I <em>do</em> have sensitive data to hide, I'll place a pure-color mask over the area, instead of a blur or pixelation effect.</p>

<p>Intuitively, blur might do better than pixelation... but that might just be my own monkey brain talking. I'd love to hear more in the comments if you've dealt with that kind of image processing in the past.</p>

<p>It's amazing what people can do with a neural network, ingenuity, and time.</p>

<p>I guess the moral of the story is <em>if you don't want people to read censored data... don't post it online</em>.</p>

<p dir="auto">We support the following built-in predicates.  We borrow some notation
from our Grammar section and allow ourselves to introduce types via
obvious naming (e.g., a &lt;condition-statement&gt; is a
&lt;statement&gt;---distinguished merely by its role/argument position in the
built-in predicate <code>if</code>).  We invoke the exclued middle: If a goal
does not succeed, then it fails.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>(and</code> &lt;statement&gt;*<code>)</code> succeeds if, proceeding from left to right,
every conjunct statement succeeds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>(or</code> &lt;statement&gt;*<code>)</code> succeeds if, proceeding from left to
right, some disjunct statement succeeds (and remaining disjuncts are
ignored).  Backtracking will explore first alternative ways to
satisfy a failing statement, then subsequent statements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>(if</code> &lt;condition-statement&gt; &lt;then-statement&gt; &lt;else-statement&gt;<code>)</code>
succeeds if either:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">The condition statement succeeds and the then statement succeeds (in which
case we do not examine the else statement under the bindings for
the condition statement's ?vars)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The condition statement fails and the else statement succeeds (in which
case we do not examine <code>then-statement</code>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Backtracking will explore alternative ways to satisfy the argument
statements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>(not</code> &lt;statement&gt;<code>)</code> succeeds if the wrapped statement fails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>(first</code> &lt;statement&gt;<code>)</code> succeeds if the argument statement succeeds.  This
form (AKA Prolog "cut") skips backtracking to explore other ways of
satisfying the statement, upon its first success.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>(same</code> &lt;term&gt; &lt;term&gt;<code>)</code> succeeds if the two terms match.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>(true)</code> succeeds unconditionally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>(false)</code> fails unconditionally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>(var</code> &lt;term&gt;<code>)</code> succeeds if the argument term is a ?var.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>(ground \&lt;term\&gt;)</code> succeeds if the argument term is ground.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>(truthy?</code> &lt;form&gt;<code>)</code> succeeds if the argument form is ground and
the result of its evaluation (in Clojure) is truthy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>(evals-from?</code> &lt;term&gt; &lt;form&gt;<code>)</code> succeeds if the argument form is
ground and the result of its evaluation (in Clojure) matches the
argument term (often a ?var).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>(do</code> &lt;form&gt;*<code>)</code> succeeds if the whole <code>do</code> expression is ground,
evaluating it (in Clojure) for side effect, only.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Creating special transforms</h2><a id="user-content-creating-special-transforms" aria-label="Permalink: Creating special transforms" href="#creating-special-transforms"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The function call below---performed by <code>initialize-prolog</code>---seeds
Clolog with some transforms for predicates we have found useful in
other Lisp-based Prologs.  As we intend this facility to support
customization, you may wish to copy our version of
<code>create-predicate-transforms</code> and edit it to your liking.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="(create-predicate-transforms)"><pre>(<span>create-predicate-transforms</span>)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><code>create-predicate-transforms</code> includes calls to
<code>create-predicate-transform</code>.  Each call is a production rule.  During
search, a goal matching <code>source-statement</code> is transformed---via
de-referencing---into <code>target-statement</code>.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="(create-predicate-transform source-statement target-statement)"><pre>(<span>create-predicate-transform</span> source-statement target-statement)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The execution machinery for transform predicates applies the first
matching transform irrevocably, with no backtracking in case of
failure.  Compared to an assertion predicate defined using using one
assertion per transform and the same statements in each
transform-assertion pair, it is as if the transform predicate's goal
always were wrapped with <code>first</code>.  We consider predicate transforms to
be "macros" for Prolog, affording us cleaner leashing than would
similar assertion predicates.  Assertion predicatess more verbose
leashing may nonetheless be helpful in prototyping and debugging
prospective transforms.  It may help to call
<code>create-predicate-transforms</code> with optional argument <code>debugging?</code>
truthy---and either disregard any effects resulting from backtracking
into prospective transform predicates ultimately intended or (as in
<code>tests/clolog/core_tests.clj</code>) avoid backtracking by limiting the
count of answers found.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Greater precision in leash report prefixes for n-ary operators
<code>and</code>, <code>or</code> (e.g., indexing potentially like-predicate conjuncts,

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    	  
<p>Benn Jordan’s latest video proposes a way to fight back when generative AI music services rip off music for their data sets. It’s not ready for prime time yet, but it does offer a window into the wild, wonderful world of adversarial noise poisoning attacks.</p>



<p>Now, if you run in circles like mine, you’ve already gotten, “Hey, have you seen this new Benn Jordan video?” already, and I suspect gotten as far as watching it, but here you go:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Art Of Poison-Pilling Music Files" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xMYm2d9bmEA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Benn’s approaches should have some real legs. There are two reasons to be optimistic. One, this family of techniques works on audio, so it <strong>covers the so-called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_hole">analog loophole</a>“</strong>: it functions <em>anywhere</em> sound is heard. Two, there’s a potential to use <strong><em>different</em> methods</strong>, thus obfuscating the results. You can also validate the results, meaning these could be updated if services react.</p>



<p>It’s funny; when I spoke to Roland’s Paul McCabe about that company’s AI initiatives, I suggested a speculative design where you could press a button and block a performance from being trained. Benn actually went directly to the data science researchers to find out how that could be done – even in a live instrumental performance. So yes, this is possible. (Of course, you count as a CDM reader if your favorite music in the entire video is the targeted pressure wave attack at 22:00. The real AI attack would be inaudible to humans, not audible as it is here but – that’s my kind of music.) </p>



<p>Most important of all, though: <strong>these methods reveal how training sets and generative audio relate</strong>. Like Benn, I have interest in generative sound, algorithmic music, machine learning. It’s not about being pro- or anti-AI like this is a sport. We’re talking about the critical examination of a technology that is sucking up a huge amount of resources and reshaping the world around us. What these techniques do – even if the generative models find ways to circumvent them – is reveal something about how the technology works. It busts some of the mythmaking at a time when the world needs transparency, not another Wizard of Oz trick. </p>



<p>The big gotcha – spoiler alert – is that this requires <strong>high-end GPUs and a massive amount of electricity and time</strong> to pull off. Computation doesn’t magically consume less power on its own, either – least of all with semiconductor trade wars looming. But now that the idea is out there, the challenge would be devising a more efficient method; this at least works as a proof of concept.</p>



<p>In short, I’m for it. And I do expect a fear of training will stop some people from sending music to streaming services. It’s not hard to envision, as Benn does, a world where distributors license this technology to give producers added peace of mind. Remember in the early 2000s when we worried about protecting music from human fans? Now we’re protecting it from generative AI.</p>



<p>It’s worth watching the video, though, because the whole world of adversarial noise gets fascinating – and is a way to imagine hacking increasing AI and surveillance. So this is all about more than just the Poisonify concept (though that’s already essential).</p>



<h3>Into the data science</h3>



<p>Here’s more on the harmony cloaking tools developed at University of Tennessee Knoxville:</p>



<p><a href="https://eu.knoxnews.com/story/news/education/2024/12/10/harmonycloak-university-of-tennessee-stops-ai-from-using-copyrighted-music/76338974007/">You can’t hear it, but University of Tennessee tool ‘cloaks’ songs to protect music from AI</a> [<em>Knoxville News</em>]</p>



<p>The site/paper also has a survey:</p>



<p><a href="https://mosis.eecs.utk.edu/harmonycloak.html">HarmonyCloak: Making Music Unlearnable for Generative AI</a></p>



<p>The instrument classification attack, as far as I know, is novel. </p>



<p>Even if it didn’t find its market in digital distribution and DSPs, as Benn notes in the video, the AI detection algorithm research Benn did also remains compelling:</p>



<p><a href="https://musictech.com/news/music/benn-jordan-detect-ai-music/">Benn Jordan has made an algorithm that can detect if music has been made by AI or not</a></p>



<p>You’ll find a lot on adversarial noise, in different contexts – because that can be a method of training neural network classifiers and a way of attacking those systems. (There’s “friendly” and “unfriendly,” basically – even though I know that conflicts with what the word “adversarial” normally means. Think of it as “I’m challenging you to a game of chess to teach you something” versus “I’m challenging you to a game of chess to <em>mind control you</em>.” Sort of.)</p>



<p>And this stuff is moving <em>fast</em>. Here’s Los Alamos National Laboratory, the folks who have never been associated with anything other than friendly uses of science and technology:</p>



<p><a href="https://www.lanl.gov/media/news/0305-ai-adversarial-attacks">New AI defense method shields models from adversarial attacks</a></p>



<p>Or some 2022 proceedings of the International Conference of Neural Information Processing Systems:</p>

<p>Targeted pressure wave attacks as discussed in the video are being deployed against machines, but they’re also known for use in sonic weapons against humans. That’s likely what was causing serious neurological symptoms in pulsed microwave energy in Cuba, the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/havana-syndrome-likely-caused-microwave-energy-government-study-finds-n1250094">so-called “Havana Syndrome”</a> – <a href="https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2018/9/6/exclusive-doctors-reveal-details-of-neuroweapon-attacks-in-havana">sound as a neuro-weapon</a>.</p>



<p>But as for using sound against machines, here you go:</p>



<p><a href="https://hal.science/hal-03878176/file/Adversarial_attacks_by_random_noises.pdf">Neural Adversarial Attacks with Random Noises</a></p>



<p>And the same broader category of mechanisms that can be used to attack can be used in training:</p>



<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09901">Modeling Adversarial Noise for Adversarial Training</a></p>



<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05337">Targeted Adversarial Attacks on Deep Reinforcement Learning Policies via Model Checking</a></p>



<p>An actual data scientist might have some better ideas; I just play one on TV.</p>



<p>Anyway, yes, my idea of fun is making music, I really don’t find genAI music to be fun, but I do also enjoy imagining generating unheard musics by rewiring machine listening to categorize things incorrectly. </p>



<p>And, I mean, obviously we need to do some kind of music compilation of (audible) adversarial noise attacks, though I guess we should be careful how we distribute it. I think I’m only interested in a malfunctioning Alexa, so this might convince me to try to buy someone’s older model just to mess with it. I … also liked the screwed-up musical results better.</p>



<p>If that meandering discourse put you to sleep, here, let me wake you up again with rage.</p>



<p>Here’s the clip that inspired the image at top; it’s a quote from Suno.ai founder Mikey Shulman:</p>







<p>Oh, sorry, that is the text as spoken with an AI-generated version of Anakin Skywalker’s voice. (I was just <a href="https://youtu.be/miVu_LOC0G0?si=-3B196q8P5-PExT5">inspired by this conversation</a>; the sentence construction seemed similar.) Here is the original clip in context, in which he also says people don’t like running (again, maybe suggesting a Darth Vader sort of solution):</p>



<blockquote data-media-max-width="560"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“It’s not really enjoyable to make music now… it takes a lot of time, it takes a lot of practice, you have to get really good at an instrument or really good at a piece of production software.
