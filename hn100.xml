										<p>Although proponents of secret science like to focus on examples in which it has benefited society, insiders from the very beginning of the Cold War worried that the best minds would not be drawn to work that they could not even talk about. Secrecy protected those involved from embarrassment or criminal prosecution, but it also made it much harder to vet experimental protocols, validate the results, or replicate them in follow-up research.</p>
<p>One research manager at a Department of Energy weapons lab would later admit, “Far more progress is actually evidenced in the unclassified fields of research than the classified ones.” The physicist Robert McCrory, whose own lab received millions in funding in partnership with Lawrence Livermore, Sandia, and Los Alamos National Laboratories, was even more blunt: “Some of the work is so poor that if it were declassified, it would be laughed off the face of the Earth.”</p>
<p>We can only guess what, specifically, McCrory had in mind when he said this. There are all too many possibilities. Collectively, they lend credence to the oft-stated concern that secret programs became a refuge for second- and third-rate minds. The wizards of Langley, for instance, considered it a “remarkable scientific achievement” when they managed to prove that cats could be “trained to move short distances.” According to a CIA veteran, Victor Marchetti, this achievement was part of a program to determine whether cats could be turned into surveillance devices:</p>
<blockquote><p>A lot of money was spent. They slit the cat open, put batteries in him, wired him up. The tail was used as an antenna. They made a monstrosity. They tested him and tested him. They found he would walk off the job when he got hungry, so they put another wire in to override that. Finally they’re ready. They took it out to a park and pointed it at a park bench and said, “Listen to those two guys. Don’t listen to anything else—not the birds, no dog or cat—just those two guys!” They put him out of the van, and a taxi comes and runs him over. There they were, sitting in the van with all those dials, and the cat was dead!</p></blockquote>
<p>The CIA nevertheless commended the “energy and imagination” of the team, and considered them potential “models for scientific pioneers.”</p>
<p><span>Secrecy protected those involved from embarrassment or criminal prosecution, but it also made it much harder to vet experimental protocols.</span></p><p>It could be argued that a sprawling research program purposely designed to push the envelope will, over several decades, inevitably produce some strange and low-quality research. But in some cases it is possible to make a side-by-side comparison of US government research with research commissioned by another country that had fewer resources but the same goal.</p>
<p>For instance, during World War II, American and British forces both used dogs to detect mines. It was delicate, dangerous work, and the dogs sometimes proved unreliable. Both governments therefore mounted research projects in the early 1950s to evaluate and improve dogs’ ability to locate mines.</p>

<p>____________________________________</p>
<p>The British just wanted “the facts” and sought out a “trained scientist.” They selected Solly Zuckerman, an anatomist expert in animal behavior. He designed the experiment to eliminate the possibility that human handlers were unconsciously influencing the dogs’ performance.</p>
<p>This required systematically isolating the specific biochemical and physiological factors that might explain success or failure, since either could prove important when mines were odorless. Zuckerman had a strong personal motivation—he had seen the devastating impact of blast injuries when he conducted wartime physiological research with the survivors. His larger agenda was to develop more rigorous experimental methods in animal research. Zuckerman found no solid evidence that dogs could be relied on to detect buried mines.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army, on the other hand, hired a “parapsychologist” named J. B. Rhine. It is not clear why—all the army records were later destroyed. Though his training was in botany, Rhine had become famous for his experiments—never replicated— in extrasensory perception (ESP) and psychokinesis. For Rhine, the study was an opportunity to prove that ESP really existed; he had already gathered a collection of amazing stories of animal ESP. Rhine once again convinced himself that dogs possessed special powers.</p>
<p>Army officials found in follow-up work that the results were random, and another study proved to be a complete failure, marked by a “rather conspicuous refusal of the dogs to alert.” But Rhine used the army money to seed new research, and found new customers. The Office of Naval Research funded a decade of work on ESP in homing pigeons. In other studies, one of Rhine’s colleagues tried to influence a cat telepathically to select one dish of food over another. But here, too, even Rhine admitted that the results were “not spectacular.” Alas, the cats proved “elusive.”</p>
<p>The US government would spend several decades on the larger program of mind-control research. And Rhine was a paragon of scientific rigor compared with some of the other researchers on the government payroll, who espoused theories of extraterrestrial and ghostly visitations to explain ESP, and were hired by the US Army to consult on psychedelic mushrooms.</p>
<p>The CIA’s Project MKUltra involved a whole series of experiments on unwitting subjects, using a range of different drugs in order to manipulate them into saying and doing things against their will. It was given carte blanche to operate without the normal Agency accounting controls or need for written contracts. Once again, researchers rapidly escalated their trials with little understanding of the effects. In the first round of an experiment conducted at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, one of the patients, Harold Blauer, was given 0.4 mg of methylenedioxyphenyl-isopropylamine, a drug similar to ecstasy. The next dose was sixteen times stronger, and Blauer was dead in thirty minutes.</p>
<p>When the family took legal action, government lawyers threatened witnesses with prosecution under the Espionage Act. Decades later, CIA Director Stansfield Turner admitted that “some unwitting testing took place,” but testified to Congress that the subjects were “criminal sexual psychopaths confined at a State hospital.” In fact, Blauer was a tennis pro who voluntarily sought treatment for depression after a divorce.</p>
<p>The CIA also experimented on its own personnel. In one case, the head of MKUltra, a chemist named Sidney Gottlieb, dosed the attendees of a joint Agency-army retreat with LSD. One of the unwitting subjects, an army biochemist named Frank Olson, was traumatized by the experience. Until then, Olson had been an outgoing and devoted family man. Afterward, he sank into depression, overcome with feelings of shame, and would not return home. He told his army supervisor that he wanted to quit or be fired.</p>
<p>Gottlieb was likely alarmed upon being warned about this situation. MKUltra had been approved by the CIA director himself, Allen Dulles, who called the program “ultra-sensitive.” But Gottlieb reportedly had not obtained prior authorization before drugging Olson and the others. As an internal Agency report later noted, participants in this work well understood that their methods were “professionally unethical” and legally dubious, and would provoke “serious adverse reaction” from the public if ever revealed. Gottlieb therefore had a powerful motivation to make certain Olson told no one about what the CIA had done to him.</p>
<p><span>The government’s venture into the paranormal proved useless for any legitimate intelligence purposes.</span></p><p>Gottlieb and his deputy decided to take Olson to see a New York doctor. The man had no psychiatric training but did have a top-secret CIA security clearance and experience with LSD. The doctor plied Olson with bourbon and sedatives, and took him to see a performance by a magician, whom Gottlieb was interested in hiring to help dose more unwitting targets. Olson’s public behavior became increasingly erratic, and he said that the Agency was “out to get him.” The doctor said he would take Olson to a sanitarium to be treated by CIA psychiatrists. But that night, Olson “fell” from the tenth floor of the Statler Hotel in Manhattan.</p>
<p>Gottlieb’s deputy was sharing the room with him, and claimed to have been asleep when it happened. His story was that Olson had just crashed right through the window, without opening it first, or even raising the shade. We may never know what happened in that hotel room. But at the time, the CIA was training its assassins to first ply their victims with drugs or alcohol, and advised, “The most efficient accident, in simple assassination, is a fall of 75 feet or more onto a hard surface.”</p>
<p>The CIA was clearly prepared to kill innocent American citizens. Six weeks after the Agency covered up what happened to Olson, a CIA mind-control team went on its first foreign assignment. The mission was to slip “artichoke”—likely LSD—into the drink of another unwitting subject and induce him to attempt an assassination of a prominent politician or American official. The artichoke team was primed for action, proudly noting that they “were ready when called upon for support, even though the operation did not materialize.”</p>
<p>Most of the MKUltra records were later destroyed, so we cannot know what other missions might have aimed to achieve. But CIA mind-control research went on for more than a decade, involved some eighty different institutions, and would eventually cost approximately ten million dollars—about a hundred million in today’s dollars.</p>
<p>A whole new mind-control program started up in 1972, this time led by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). The goal of this new program was “to determine whether anomalous mental phenomena (i.e. extrasensory perception and psychokinesis) existed and the degree to which such phenomena might be applicable to problems of national interest.” Like MKUltra, it went on for many years, and cost many millions of dollars. How many exactly is still difficult to determine. But a single California contractor, SRI International, would eventually receive $11.3 million (or about thirty-six million in today’s dollars).</p>
<p>Even escape artists and magicians saw that the government was being rooked, and patiently explained to officials how timeworn tools of their trade could easily trick someone into believing in ESP. So, too, did the scientists at DARPA, who concluded that the Israeli illusionist Uri Geller, the DIA’s star pupil, was a “charlatan.” They thought it was “ridiculous” that Geller had fooled the US government into using taxpayer dollars to see whether he could bend spoons with his brain. They pointed to a host of problems with the ESP and psychokinesis experiments, above all the fact that the people paid to conduct them had a financial incentive to produce positive results.</p>
<p><span>Under the cloak of secrecy, their hubris and magical thinking ran wild.</span></p><p>In 1985, the army commissioned a blue-ribbon panel from the National Research Council to evaluate the program. The panel concluded there was “no scientific warrant for the existence of parapsychological phenomena” such as “remote-viewing”—sensing the location or appearance of things through sheer mental effort—or psychokinesis.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, over the following decade the army conducted between fifty and a hundred more such experiments. In 1995, another review of the remote-viewing program was commissioned, this time by the American Institutes for Research (AIR). Once again, the reviewers found that, because of flaws in the research designs, there was no clear evidence demonstrating the existence of the paranormal.</p>
<p>But the AIR report found something even more damning. After some twenty-five years of experiments, the reviewers concluded, “In no case had the information provided ever been used to guide intelligence operations.” Even if some people really do have ESP that cannot be explained by science, the point of the program was not to use government resources to explore the Twilight Zone. It was to support actual missions that would safeguard national security. Yet, despite all the time and money spent—not to mention the human costs—the government’s venture into the paranormal proved useless for any legitimate intelligence purposes.</p>
<p>Why, then, did the intelligence community and the Pentagon go to extremes in pursuing such embarrassing “research”? For the same reason why they felt they had license to control the weather and alter the upper atmosphere: because, under the cloak of secrecy, their hubris and magical thinking ran wild. Moreover, controlling people’s minds was a prize that was just too tempting to resist. And although the government may have given up on telekinetic spoons, it did not give up on that larger goal.</p>
<p>During the first decade of the “Global War on Terror,” the CIA pursued mind control through more direct methods—i.e., “enhanced interrogation.” The program employed psychological abuse, stress positions, and waterboarding not just to make people talk, but also to discover scientifically rigorous and reproducible methods for compelling subjects to submit to the will of interrogators and lose all sense of personal agency. Just like MKUltra, the enhanced-interrogation program was conducted as a series of “experiments.” Here is how the CIA’s Office of Medical Services, in a top- secret 2004 document, described the protocol for recording the application of “treatments” to “subjects”:</p>
<blockquote><p>In order to best inform future medical judgments and recommendations, it is important that every application of the waterboard be thoroughly documented: how long each application (and the entire procedure) lasted, how much water was used in the process (realizing that much splashes off), how exactly the water was applied, if a seal was achieved, if the naso- or oropharynx was filled, what sort of volume was expelled, how long was the break between applications, and how the subject looked between each treatment.</p></blockquote>
<p>The CIA hired a retired air-force psychologist named James Mitchell to enact these methods. Mitchell, too, saw himself as a scientist. As an informed source recounted to the journalist Jane Mayer, after Mitchell took over a case, he told the FBI agents that an interrogation “was like an experiment, when you apply electric shocks to a caged dog, after a while, he’s so diminished, he can’t resist.” When the agents argued that the subject of this experiment was a human being and not a dog, Mitchell retorted, “Science is science.”</p>
<p>Waterboarding, “diapering,” and stress positions ultimately proved no more effective than ESP or psychokinesis, as the CIA’s own internal reviews concluded. Many of the victims had already provided valuable intelligence to their interrogators before they were tortured, and once the waterboarding began, many offered false information in order to make it stop. But the waterboarding did not stop until Mitchell’s company was paid eighty-one million dollars.</p>

Fairphone, a competing Android manufacturer that prioritizes lengthy support periods for its devices, has <a href="https://www.fairphone.com/en/2020/06/18/fairphone-2-gets-android-9/">publicly spoken about</a> how difficult it is to continue to support a phone after a chipset manufacturer like Qualcomm ends support for the processor used. In Google’s case with Tensor, the power is in its own hands.</p><p>Apple, another manufacturer that also produces its own processors for its phones, offers similarly lengthy support periods. Although the company doesn’t promote explicit promises about the number of years it supports its devices for, it released five major iOS version updates for the 2017 iPhone X before ending support with iOS 17 this year. Even then, however, Apple will <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213913">occasionally release security patches for older devices</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In theory, Google’s pledge should mean the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro get updated to at least 2029’s Android 20 and maybe even 2030’s Android 21, depending on when in the year the update gets released. But that assumes Google is still using the same annual release cadence for Android seven years from now, even before we get into its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/30/23851107/google-graveyard-pixel-pass-subscription-phone-upgrades">somewhat flaky history</a> of ongoing support for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20977968/google-graveyard-products-shut-down-dead-not-supported-discontinues-spring-cleaning">other services and initiatives</a>.</p><p>Although seven years of security support puts Google out ahead of its mainstream competitors, it’s still technically beaten by Fairphone, which recently announced the Fairphone 5 with a promised eight years of security updates (with 10 years as a stretch goal). However, Fairphone has no plans to sell its fifth-generation device in the US and is also only committed to releasing five major Android OS updates.</p><div><p>Check out our complete coverage of the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, as well as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23660312">Pixel Watch 2</a> that Google also announced today, in our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/4/23895660/google-pixel-8-event-news-roundup">guide to the Google Pixel 8 launch event</a>. </p></div><p><h3>Related:</h3></p></div></div>]]></description>

            <span>Abstract:</span>The capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have sparked debate over whether such systems just learn an enormous collection of superficial statistics or a coherent model of the data generating process -- a world model. We find evidence for the latter by analyzing the learned representations of three spatial datasets (world, US, NYC places) and three temporal datasets (historical figures, artworks, news headlines) in the Llama-2 family of models. We discover that LLMs learn linear representations of space and time across multiple scales. These representations are robust to prompting variations and unified across different entity types (e.g. cities and landmarks). In addition, we identify individual ``space neurons'' and ``time neurons'' that reliably encode spatial and temporal coordinates. Our analysis demonstrates that modern LLMs acquire structured knowledge about fundamental dimensions such as space and time, supporting the view that they learn not merely superficial statistics, but literal world models.

According to Nintendo, “This also includes online co-operative play, internet rankings, and data distribution.”</p><p>News of this early April 2024 shutdown follows <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/2/23817238/nintendo-mario-kart-8-splatoon-wii-u-online-multiplayer">the return of online features</a> for the Wii U versions of <em>Mario Kart 8 </em>and <em>Splatoon</em>, which had disappeared between <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/3/23623618/nintendo-wii-u-mario-kart-8-splatoon-offline-vulnerability-exploit">March</a> and August while Nintendo dealt with a “vulnerability related to online play.”</p><div><p>One service that will continue operating, for now, is <em>Pokémon Bank</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/4/4693376/pokemon-bank-cloud-storage-service">the cloud storage service that launched in 2013 with <em>Pokémon X</em> and<em> Y</em></a> (although you may want to transfer that collection to the newer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21134790/pokemon-home-pokedex-transporter-move-3ds-games-switch-android-ios">Pok<em>é</em>mon Home</a> setup), and gaming offline is still possible. Also, <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/63227/">this FAQ from Nintendo</a> says that players will be able to download patches and redownload games purchased from the eShop “for the foreseeable future.” eShop sales of Wii U and 3DS games <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/19/23269792/nintendo-wii-u-3ds-eshop-closing-date-2023">ended in March of this year</a>.</p></div><p>There’s no specific date listed for the shutdown yet, and Nintendo’s FAQ also mentions that “if an event occurs that would make it difficult to continue online services for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U software, we may have to discontinue services earlier than planned.”</p><p>SpotPass features are also going away, but Nintendo says that StreetPass links between 3DS family systems will continue to work anywhere you can find someone else who has one, even after these servers go away. This planned early April 2024 shutdown will occur just over ten years <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/26/5452180/nintendo-wi-fi-connection-ending-in-may">after the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection Service went offline</a>, ending online services for Nintendo’s Wii and DS titles in 2014.</p><p><strong>Nintendo:</strong></p><div><blockquote><p>For example, you will be able to use StreetPass in StreetPass Mii Plaza, which is pre-installed on Nintendo 3DS family systems, but you will no longer be able to use features that use online communication (such as receiving new panels in Puzzle Swap).</p></blockquote></div><p>This also brings to an end to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/11/9712806/nintendo-3ds-badge-arcade"><em>Nintendo Badge Arcade </em></a>game that let owners decorate their 3DS home menus with stickers snagged using a virtual crane arm.

OpenSSH 9.5 is out.  Significant changes include a transport-level ping
mechanism and keystroke timing obfuscation:
</p><blockquote>
	This attempts to hide inter-keystroke timings by sending
   	interactive traffic at fixed intervals (default: every 20ms) when
   	there is only a small amount of data being sent. It also sends fake
   	"chaff" keystrokes for a random interval after the last real
   	keystroke. These are controlled by a new ssh_config
   	ObscureKeystrokeTiming keyword.

Changes since OpenSSH 9.4
=========================

This release fixes a number of bugs and adds some small features.

Potentially incompatible changes
--------------------------------

 * ssh-keygen(1): generate Ed25519 keys by default. Ed25519 public keys
   are very convenient due to their small size. Ed25519 keys are
   specified in RFC 8709 and OpenSSH has supported them since version 6.5
   (January 2014).
    
 * sshd(8): the Subsystem directive now accurately preserves quoting of
   subsystem commands and arguments. This may change behaviour for exotic
   configurations, but the most common subsystem configuration
   (sftp-server) is unlikely to be affected.

New features
------------

 * ssh(1): add keystroke timing obfuscation to the client. This attempts
   to hide inter-keystroke timings by sending interactive traffic at
   fixed intervals (default: every 20ms) when there is only a small
   amount of data being sent. It also sends fake "chaff" keystrokes for
   a random interval after the last real keystroke. These are
   controlled by a new ssh_config ObscureKeystrokeTiming keyword.
    
 * ssh(1), sshd(8): Introduce a transport-level ping facility. This adds
   a pair of SSH transport protocol messages SSH2_MSG_PING/PONG to
   implement a ping capability. These messages use numbers in the "local
   extensions" number space and are advertised using a "ping@openssh.com"
   ext-info message with a string version number of "0".
    
 * sshd(8): allow override of Sybsystem directives in sshd Match blocks.

Bugfixes
--------

 * scp(1): fix scp in SFTP mode recursive upload and download of
   directories that contain symlinks to other directories. In scp mode,
   the links would be followed, but in SFTP mode they were not. bz3611
    
 * ssh-keygen(1): handle cr+lf (instead of just cr) line endings in
   sshsig signature files.
    
 * ssh(1): interactive mode for ControlPersist sessions if they
   originally requested a tty.
    
 * sshd(8): make PerSourceMaxStartups first-match-wins
    
 * sshd(8): limit artificial login delay to a reasonable maximum (5s)
   and don't delay at all for the "none" authentication mechanism.cw
    bz3602
    
 * sshd(8): Log errors in kex_exchange_identification() with level
   verbose instead of error to reduce preauth log spam. All of those
   get logged with a more generic error message by sshpkt_fatal().
    
 * sshd(8): correct math for ClientAliveInterval that caused the probes
    to be sent less frequently than configured.
    
 * ssh(1): fix regression in OpenSSH 9.4 (mux.c r1.99) that caused
   multiplexed sessions to ignore SIGINT under some circumstances.

Portability
-----------

 * Avoid clang zero-call-used-regs=all bug on Apple compilers, which
   for some reason have version numbers that do not match the upstream
   clang version numbers. bz#3584

 * Fix configure test for zlib 1.3 and later/development versions. bz3604

<p>Have you heard about CRDTs and wondered what they are? Maybe you’ve looked into them a bit, but ran into a wall of academic papers and math jargon? That was me before I started my <a href="https://www.recurse.com/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Recurse Center</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://www.recurse.com/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://d29xw0ra2h4o4u.cloudfront.net/assets/logo_square-60e12570c3a1b0b0798e651a0755f71a40ff15421761b786f720e4c02fc89a1f.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">The Recurse Center</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">The Recurse Center is a self-directed, community-driven educational retreat for programmers in New York City.</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://d29xw0ra2h4o4u.cloudfront.net/assets/favicon-fbfd4d3b58909892b7caada24c507292a4f96f5ab03fda9a7ae3050ce4618f78.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">www.recurse.com/</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"><use href="/icons.svg#share"></use></svg></span></a> batch. But I’ve spent the past month or so doing research and writing code, and it turns out that you can build a lot with just a few simple things!</p>
<p>In this two-part series, we’ll learn what a CRDT is. Then we’ll write a primitive CRDT, compose it into more complex data structures, and finally use what we’ve learned to build a collaborative pixel art editor. All of this assumes no prior knowledge about CRDTs, and only a rudimentary knowledge of TypeScript.</p>
<p>To pique your curiosity, this is what we’ll end up with:</p>
<pixelart-demo resolution="100"></pixelart-demo>

<p>Draw by clicking and dragging with your mouse. Change the paint color by using the color input on the bottom left. You can draw on either canvas and your changes will show up on the other, as if they were collaborating on the same picture.</p>
<p>Clicking the network button prevents changes from reaching the other canvas (although they’ll sync up again when they come back “online”). The latency slider adds a delay before changes on one canvas show up on the other.</p>
<p>We’ll build that in the next post. First, we need to learn about CRDTs!</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-crdt">What is a CRDT?</h3>
<p>Okay, let’s start from the top. CRDT stands for “Conflict-free Replicated Data Type”. That’s a long acronym, but the concept isn’t too complicated. It’s a kind of data structure that can be stored on different computers (peers). Each peer can update its own state instantly, without a network request to check with other peers. Peers may have different states at different points in time, but are guaranteed to eventually converge on a single agreed-upon state. That makes CRDTs great for building rich collaborative apps, like Google Docs and Figma — without requiring a central server to sync changes.</p>
<p>Broadly, there are two kinds of CRDTs: state-based and operation-based.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-cvrdt" id="user-content-fnref-cvrdt" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">1</a></sup> State-based CRDTs transmit their full state between peers, and a new state is obtained by merging all the states together. Operation-based CRDTs transmit only the actions that users take, which can be used to calculate a new state.</p>
<p>That might make operation-based CRDTs sound way better. For example, if a user updates one item in a list, an operation-based CRDT can send a description of only that update, while a state-based CRDT has to send the whole list! The drawback is that operation-based CRDTs impose constraints on the communication channel: messages must be delivered exactly once, in causal order, to each peer.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-delta" id="user-content-fnref-delta" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">2</a></sup></p>
<p>This post will exclusively focus on on state-based CRDTs. For brevity, I’ll just say “CRDTs” from here on out, but know that I’m referring specifically to state-based CRDTs.</p>
<p>I’ve been talking about what CRDTs do, but what <strong>is</strong> a CRDT? Let’s make it concrete: a CRDT is any data structure that implements this interface:<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-ackshually" id="user-content-fnref-ackshually" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">3</a></sup></p>
<pre><code><span>interface</span> <span><span>CRDT</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>S</span><span>&gt;</span></span> <span>{</span>
  value<span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>;</span>
  state<span>:</span> <span>S</span><span>;</span>
  <span>merge</span><span>(</span>state<span>:</span> <span>S</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>void</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>That is to say, a CRDT contains at least three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A value, <code>T</code>. This is the part the rest of our program cares about. The entire point of the CRDT is to reliably sync the value between peers.</li>
<li>A state, <code>S</code>. This is the metadata needed for peers to agree on the same value. To update other peers, the whole state is serialized and sent to them.</li>
<li>A merge function. This is a function that takes some state (probably received from another peer) and merges it with the local state.</li>
</ul>
<p>The merge function must satisfy three properties to ensure that all peers arrive at the same result (I’ll use the notation <code>A ∨ B</code> to indicate merging state <code>A</code> into state <code>B</code>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Commutativity: states can be merged in any order; <code>A ∨ B = B ∨ A</code>. If Alice and Bob exchange states, they can each merge the other’s state into their own and arrive at the same result.</li>
<li>Associativity: when merging three (or more) states, it doesn’t matter which are merged first; <code>(A ∨ B) ∨ C = A ∨ (B ∨ C)</code>. If Alice receives states from both Bob and Carol, she can merge them into her own state in any order and the result will be the same.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-thesamepicture" id="user-content-fnref-thesamepicture" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">4</a></sup></li>
<li>Idempotence: merging a state with itself doesn’t change the state; <code>A ∨ A = A</code>. If Alice merges her own state with itself, the result will be the same state she started with.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mathematically proving that a merge function has all these properties might sound hard. But luckily, we don’t have to do that! Instead, we can just combine CRDTs that already exist, leaning on the fact that someone has proven these things for us.</p>
<p>Speaking of CRDTs that already exist: let’s learn about one!</p>
<h3 id="last-write-wins-register">Last Write Wins Register</h3>
<p>A register is a CRDT that holds a single value. There are a couple kinds of registers, but the simplest is the Last Write Wins Register (or LWW Register).</p>
<p>LWW Registers, as the name suggests, simply overwrite their current value with the last value written. They determine which write occurred last using timestamps, represented here by integers that increment whenever the value is updated.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-logical" id="user-content-fnref-logical" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">5</a></sup> Here’s the algorithm:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the received timestamp is less than the local timestamp, the register doesn’t change its state.</li>
<li>If the received timestamp is greater than the local timestamp, the register overwrites its local value with the received value. It also stores the received timestamp and some sort of identifier unique to the peer that last wrote the value (the peer ID).</li>
<li>Ties are broken by comparing the local peer ID to the peer ID in the received state.</li>
</ul>
<p>Try it out with the playground below.</p>
<lwwregister-demo></lwwregister-demo>

<p>Did you get a sense for how LWW Registers work? Here are a couple specific scenarios to try:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn the network off, make a bunch of updates to <code>bob</code>, and then turn it back on. When you send updates from <code>alice</code>, they’ll be rejected until the timestamp exceeds <code>bob</code>’s timestamp.</li>
<li>Perform the same setup, but once you turn the network back on, send an update from <code>bob</code> to <code>alice</code>. Notice how the timestamps are now synced up and <code>alice</code> can write to <code>bob</code> again!</li>
<li>Increase the latency and send an update from both peers simultaneously. <code>alice</code> will accept <code>bob</code>’s update, but <code>bob</code> will reject <code>alice</code>‘s. Since <code>bob</code>’s peer ID is greater, it breaks the timestamp tie.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s the code for the LWW Register:</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>LWWRegister<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span></span> <span>{</span>
  <span>readonly</span> id<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>;</span>

  <span>get</span> <span>value</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>state<span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>constructor</span><span>(</span>id<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span> state<span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>string</span><span>,</span> <span>number</span><span>,</span> <span>T</span><span>]</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>this</span><span>.</span>state <span>=</span> state<span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>set</span><span>(</span>value<span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>}</span>

  <span>merge</span><span>(</span>state<span>:</span> <span>[</span>peer<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span> timestamp<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>,</span> value<span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>]</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>[</span>remotePeer<span>,</span> remoteTimestamp<span>]</span> <span>=</span> state<span>;</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>[</span>localPeer<span>,</span> localTimestamp<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>state<span>;</span>

    <span>// if the local timestamp is greater than the remote timestamp, discard the incoming value</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>localTimestamp <span>&gt;</span> remoteTimestamp<span>)</span> <span>return</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// if the timestamps are the same but the local peer ID is greater than the remote peer ID, discard the incoming value</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>localTimestamp <span>===</span> remoteTimestamp <span>&amp;&amp;</span> localPeer <span>&gt;</span> remotePeer<span>)</span> <span>return</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// otherwise, overwrite the local state with the remote state</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span>state <span>=</span> state<span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Let’s see how this stacks up to the CRDT interface:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>state</code> is a tuple of the peer ID that last wrote to the register, the timestamp of the last write and the value stored in the register.</li>
<li><code>value</code> is simply the last element of the <code>state</code> tuple.</li>
<li><code>merge</code> is a method that implements the algorithm described above.</li>
</ul>
<p>LWW Registers have one more method named <code>set</code>, which is called locally to set the register’s value. It also updates the local metadata, recording the local peer ID as the last writer and incrementing the local timestamp by one.</p>
<p>That’s it! Although it appears simple, the humble LWW Register is a powerful building block with which we can create actual applications.</p>
<h3 id="last-write-wins-map">Last Write Wins Map</h3>
<p>Most programs involve more than one value,<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-citation" id="user-content-fnref-citation" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">6</a></sup> which means we’ll need a more complex CRDT than the LWW Register. The one we’ll learn about today is called the Last Write Wins Map (or LWW Map).</p>
<p>Let’s start by defining a couple types. First, our value type:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> <span>Value<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span></span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>[</span>key<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>]</span><span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>If each individual map value holds type <code>T</code>, then the value of the entire LWW Map is a mapping of string keys to <code>T</code> values.</p>
<p>Here’s our state type:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> <span>State<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span></span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>[</span>key<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>]</span><span>:</span> LWWRegister<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span> <span>|</span> <span>null</span><span>&gt;</span><span>[</span><span>"state"</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>Do you see the trick? From our application’s perspective, the LWW Map just holds normal values — but <strong>it actually holds LWW Registers</strong>. When we look at the full state, each key’s state is the state of the LWW Register at that key.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-null" id="user-content-fnref-null" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">7</a></sup></p>
<p>I want to pause on that for a moment, because it’s important. Composition lets us combine primitive CRDTs into more complex ones. When it’s time to merge, all the parent does is pass slices of incoming state to the appropriate child’s merge function. We can nest this process as many times as we want; each complex CRDT passing ever-smaller slices of state down to the next level, until we finally hit a primitive CRDT that performs the actual merge.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the LWW Map merge function is simple: iterate through each key and hand off the incoming state at that key to the corresponding LWW Register to merge. Try it out in the playground below:</p>
<lwwmap-demo add="off" delete="off" state="{ &quot;foo&quot;: [&quot;alice&quot;, 1, &quot;lorem ipsum&quot;], &quot;bar&quot;: [&quot;bob&quot;, 1, &quot;dolor sit amet&quot;] }"></lwwmap-demo>

<p>It’s kind of difficult to trace what’s happening here, so let’s split up the state for each key. Note, though, that this is just a visualization aid; the full state is still being transmitted as a single unit.</p>
<p>Try increasing the latency and then updating different keys on each peer. You’ll see that each peer accepts the updated value with a higher timestamp, while rejecting the value with a lower timestamp.</p>
<lwwmap-demo split="true" add="off" delete="off" state="{ &quot;foo&quot;: [&quot;alice&quot;, 1, &quot;lorem ipsum&quot;], &quot;bar&quot;: [&quot;bob&quot;, 1, &quot;dolor sit amet&quot;] }"></lwwmap-demo>

<p>The full LWW Map class is kinda beefy, so let’s go through each property one by one. Here’s the start of it:</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>LWWMap<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span></span> <span>{</span>
  <span>readonly</span> id <span>=</span> <span>""</span><span>;</span>
  #data <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Map<span>&lt;</span><span>string</span><span>,</span> LWWRegister<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span> <span>|</span> <span>null</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>constructor</span><span>(</span>id<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span> state<span>:</span> State<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span>id <span>=</span> id<span>;</span>

    <span>// create a new register for each key in the initial state</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>[</span>key<span>,</span> register<span>]</span> <span>of</span> Object<span>.</span><span>entries</span><span>(</span>state<span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>this</span><span>.</span>#data<span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span>key<span>,</span> <span>new</span> <span>LWWRegister</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span>id<span>,</span> register<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p><code>#data</code> is a private property holding a map of the keys to LWW Register instances. To instantiate a LWW Map with preexisting state, we need to iterate through the state and instantiate each LWW Register.</p>
<p>Remember, CRDTs need three properties: <code>value</code>, <code>state</code> and <code>merge</code>. We’ll look at <code>value</code> first:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>get</span> <span>value</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> value<span>:</span> Value<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// build up an object where each value is set to the value of the register at the corresponding key</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>[</span>key<span>,</span> register<span>]</span> <span>of</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>#data<span>.</span><span>entries</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>if</span> <span>(</span>register<span>.</span>value <span>!==</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span> value<span>[</span>key<span>]</span> <span>=</span> register<span>.</span>value<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>return</span> value<span>;</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>It’s a getter that iterates through the keys and gets each register’s <code>value</code>. As far as the rest of the app is concerned, it’s just normal map!</p>
<p>Now let’s look at <code>state</code>:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>get</span> <span>state</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> state<span>:</span> State<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// build up an object where each value is set to the full state of the register at the corresponding key</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>[</span>key<span>,</span> register<span>]</span> <span>of</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>#data<span>.</span><span>entries</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>if</span> <span>(</span>register<span>)</span> state<span>[</span>key<span>]</span> <span>=</span> register<span>.</span>state<span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>return</span> state<span>;</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Similar to <code>value</code>, it’s a getter that builds up a map from each register’s <code>state</code>.</p>
<p>There’s a clear trend here: iterating through the keys in <code>#data</code> and handing things off to the register stored at that key. You’d think <code>merge</code> would work the same way, but it’s a little more involved:</p>

    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>First, we iterate through the incoming <code>state</code> parameter rather than the local <code>#data</code>. That’s because if the incoming state is missing a key that <code>#data</code> has, we know that we don’t need to touch that key.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-delete" id="user-content-fnref-delete" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">8</a></sup></p>
<p>For each key in the incoming state, we get the local register at that key. If we find one, the peer is <strong>updating</strong> an existing key that we already know about, so we call that register’s <code>merge</code> method with the incoming state at that key. Otherwise, the peer has <strong>added</strong> a new key to the map, so we instantiate a new LWW Register using the incoming state at that key.</p>
<p>In addition to the CRDT methods, we need to implement methods more commonly found on maps: <code>set</code>, <code>get</code>, <code>delete</code> and <code>has</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s start with <code>set</code>:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>set</span><span>(</span>key<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>,</span> value<span>:</span> <span>T</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// get the register at the given key</span>
    <span>const</span> register <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>#data<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span>key<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>// if the register already exists, set the value</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>register<span>)</span> register<span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span>value<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>// otherwise, instantiate a new `LWWRegister` with the value</span>
    <span>else</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>#data<span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span>key<span>,</span> <span>new</span> <span>LWWRegister</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span>id<span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>this</span><span>.</span>id<span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>,</span> value<span>]</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Just like in the merge method, we’re either calling the register’s <code>set</code> to update an existing key, or instantiating a new LWW Register to add a new key. The initial state uses the local peer ID, a timestamp of 1 and the value passed to <code>set</code>.</p>
<p><code>get</code> is even simpler:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>get</span><span>(</span>key<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>#data<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span>key<span>)</span><span>?.</span>value <span>??</span> <span>undefined</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Get the register from the local map, and return its value if it has one.</p>
<p>Why coalesce to <code>undefined</code>? Because each register holds <code>T | null</code>. And with the <code>delete</code> method, we’re ready to explain why:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>delete</span><span>(</span>key<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// set the register to null, if it exists</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span>#data<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span>key<span>)</span><span>?.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Rather than fully removing the key from the map, we set the register value to <code>null</code>. The metadata is kept around so we can disambiguate deletions from states that simply don’t have a key yet. These are called <strong>tombstones</strong> — the ghosts of CRDTs past.</p>
<p>Consider what would happen if we really did delete the keys from the map, rather than leaving a tombstone. Here’s a playground where peers can add keys, but not delete them. Can you figure out how to get a peer to delete a key?</p>
<lwwmap-demo delete="off" merge="naive" state="{ &quot;foo&quot;: [&quot;alice&quot;, 1, &quot;lorem ipsum&quot;] }"></lwwmap-demo>

<p>Turn off the network, add a key to <code>alice</code>’s map, then turn the network back on. Finally, make a change to <code>bob</code>’s map. Since <code>alice</code> sees that the incoming state from <code>bob</code> is missing that key, she removes it from her own state — even though <code>bob</code> never knew about that key in the first place. Whoops!</p>
<p>Here’s a playground with the correct behavior. You can also see what happens when a key is deleted.</p>
<lwwmap-demo state="{ &quot;foo&quot;: [&quot;alice&quot;, 1, &quot;lorem ipsum&quot;] }"></lwwmap-demo>

<p>Notice how we never remove deleted keys from the map. This is one drawback to CRDTs — we can only ever add information, not remove it. Although from the application’s perspective the key has been fully deleted, the underlying state still records that the key was once there. In technical terms, we say that CRDTs are <strong>monotonically increasing</strong> data structures.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-efficiency" id="user-content-fnref-efficiency" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">9</a></sup></p>
<p>The final LWW Map method is <code>has</code>, which returns a boolean indicating whether the map contains a given key.</p>
<pre><code>  <span>has</span><span>(</span>key<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// if a register doesn't exist or its value is null, the map doesn't contain the key</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>#data<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span>key<span>)</span><span>?.</span>value <span>!==</span> <span>null</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>There’s a special case here: if the map contains a register at the given key, but the register contains <code>null</code>, the map is considered to not contain the key.</p>
<p>For posterity, here’s the full LWW Map code:</p>

<p>They’re also known as CvRDTs (“Cv” standing for “convergent”) and CmRDTs (“Cm” standing for “commutative”), respectively, although I think “state-based” and “operation-based” are the preferred terms. <a href="#user-content-fnref-cvrdt" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to content" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="user-content-fn-delta">
<p>There are also delta CRDTs, or hybrid CRDTs, which allow peers to negotiate the subset of the state they need to send each other. That’s one example of blending operation-based and state-based CRDTs. But the fundamental tradeoff remains: sending less data between peers means more constraints on communication. <a href="#user-content-fnref-delta" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to content" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">↩</a></p>

<p>Technically, a CRDT can be anything that follows the merging rules described below.

<p>Commutativity and associativity might sound the same, and indeed most commutative operations are also associative. But there are a few math operations that are only one or the other.

<p>There are a couple ways mitigate this drawback, both of which are outside the scope of this article. One is “garbage collection”: pruning tombstones from CRDTs, which prevents you from merging states with any changes made before the tombstones were removed. Another is creating an efficient format to encode the data. You can also combine these methods.

            <span>Abstract:</span>Language models generate responses by producing a series of tokens in immediate succession: the $(K+1)^{th}$ token is an outcome of manipulating $K$ hidden vectors per layer, one vector per preceding token. What if instead we were to let the model manipulate say, $K+10$ hidden vectors, before it outputs the $(K+1)^{th}$ token? We operationalize this idea by performing training and inference on language models with a (learnable) $\textit{pause}$ token, a sequence of which is appended to the input prefix. We then delay extracting the model's outputs until the last pause token is seen, thereby allowing the model to process extra computation before committing to an answer. We empirically evaluate $\textit{pause-training}$ on decoder-only models of 1B and 130M parameters with causal pretraining on C4, and on downstream tasks covering reasoning, question-answering, general understanding and fact recall. Our main finding is that inference-time delays show gains when the model is both pre-trained and finetuned with delays. For the 1B model, we witness gains on 8 of 9 tasks, most prominently, a gain of $18\%$ EM score on the QA task of SQuAD, $8\%$ on CommonSenseQA and $1\%$ accuracy on the reasoning task of GSM8k. Our work raises a range of conceptual and practical future research questions on making delayed next-token prediction a widely applicable new paradigm.

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> previous version of this post didn't have "static" in the title to keep it short (but the body did). Added it in the title for clarification.</p>
<p>I've been writing software for over 20 years, and with every day that goes by I grow more certain that strong static typing is not just a good idea, but also almost always the right choice.</p>
<p>There are definitely uses for untyped languages (or language variants), for example they are much nicer when using a REPL, or for throwaway scripts in environments that are already hopelessly untyped (e.g. the shell). In almost every other case, however, strong typing is strongly preferred.</p>
<p>There are advantages to not using types, such as a faster development speed, but they pale in comparison to all of the advantages. To that I say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing software without types lets you go at full speed. Full speed towards the cliff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question around strong static typing is simple: would you rather work a bit more and get invariants checked at compile-time (or type-checking time for non-compiled languages), or work a bit less and have them be enforced at runtime, or even worse not enforced even at runtime (JavaScript, I'm looking at you... <code>1 + "2" == 12</code>).</p>
<p>Getting errors at runtime is a terrible idea. First, it means that you won't always catch them during development. Second, when you do catch them, it will happen in a customer facing manner. Yes, tests help, but writing tests for every possible mistyped function parameter is impossible given the endless possibilities. Even if you could, having types is much easier than testing for wrong types.</p>
<h2 id="types-lead-to-less-bugs">Types lead to less bugs</h2>
<p>Types also offer annotations to code that benefit both humans and machines. Having types is a way to more strictly define the contract between different pieces of code.</p>
<p>Consider the following four examples. They all do exactly the same thing just with varying level of contract definition.</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span>// Params: Name (a string) and age (a number).</span>
</span><span><span>function</span> <span>birthdayGreeting1</span><span>(</span><span><span>...</span>params</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>return</span> <span><span>`</span><span><span>${</span>params<span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>}</span></span><span> is </span><span><span>${</span>params<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>}</span></span><span>!</span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>// Params: Name (a string) and age (a number).</span>
</span><span><span>function</span> <span>birthdayGreeting2</span><span>(</span><span>name<span>,</span> age</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>return</span> <span><span>`</span><span><span>${</span>name<span>}</span></span><span> is </span><span><span>${</span>age<span>}</span></span><span>!</span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>function</span> <span>birthdayGreeting3</span><span>(</span><span>name<span>:</span> string<span>,</span> age<span>:</span> number</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> string <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>return</span> <span><span>`</span><span><span>${</span>name<span>}</span></span><span> is </span><span><span>${</span>age<span>}</span></span><span>!</span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first one doesn't even define the number of parameters, so it's hard to know what it does without reading the docs. I believe most people will agree the first one is an abomination and wouldn't write code like that. Though it's a very similar idea to typing, it's about defining the contract between the caller and the callee.</p>
<p>As for the second and the third, because of the typing, the third will need less documentation. The code is simpler, but admittedly, the advantages are fairly limited. Well, until you actually change this function...</p>
<p>In both the second and the third functions, the author assumes the age is a number. So it is absolutely fine to change the code as below:</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span>// Params: Name (a string) and age (a number).</span>
</span><span><span>function</span> <span>birthdayGreeting2</span><span>(</span><span>name<span>,</span> age</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>return</span> <span><span>`</span><span><span>${</span>name<span>}</span></span><span> will turn </span><span><span>${</span>age <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>}</span></span><span> next year!</span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>function</span> <span>birthdayGreeting3</span><span>(</span><span>name<span>:</span> string<span>,</span> age<span>:</span> number</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> string <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>return</span> <span><span>`</span><span><span>${</span>name<span>}</span></span><span> will turn </span><span><span>${</span>age <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>}</span></span><span> next year!</span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The problem is that some of the places that use this code accept user input which was collected from an HTML input (so always a string). Which will result in:</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span>&gt;</span> <span>birthdayGreeting2</span><span>(</span><span>"John"</span><span>,</span> <span>"20"</span><span>)</span>
</span><span><span>"John will turn 201 next year!"</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>While the typed version will correctly fail to compile because this function excepts age to be a number, not a string.</p>
<p>Having the contract between a caller and callee is important for a codebase, so that callers can know when callees change. This is especially important for an open source library, where the callers and the callees are not written by the same group of people. With this contract it's impossible to know how things change when they do.</p>
<h2 id="types-lead-to-a-better-development-experience">Types lead to a better development experience</h2>
<p>Typing can also be used by IDEs and other development tools to vastly improve the development experience. You get notified as you code if any of your expectations are wrong. This significantly reduces cognitive load. You no longer need to remember the types of all the variables and the function in the context. The compiler will be there with you and tell you when something is wrong.</p>
<p>This also leads to a very nice additional benefit: easier refactoring. You can trust the compiler to let you know whether a change you make (e.g. the change in our example above) will break assumptions made elsewhere in the code or not.</p>
<p>Types also make it much easier to onboard new engineers to a codebase or library:</p>
<ol>
<li>They can follow the type definitions to understand where things are used.</li>
<li>It's much easier to tinker with things as changes will trigger a compile error.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's consider the following changes to our above code:</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span>class</span> <span>Person</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>  name<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>  age<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>function</span> <span>birthdayGreeting2</span><span>(</span>person<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>return</span> <span><span>`</span><span><span>${</span>person<span>.</span>name<span>}</span></span><span> will turn </span><span><span>${</span>person<span>.</span>age <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>}</span></span><span> next year!</span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>function</span> <span>birthdayGreeting3</span><span>(</span>person<span>:</span> Person<span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>return</span> <span><span>`</span><span><span>${</span>person<span>.</span>name<span>}</span></span><span> will turn </span><span><span>${</span>person<span>.</span>age <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>}</span></span><span> next year!</span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>function</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>  <span>const</span> person<span>:</span> Person <span>=</span> <span>{</span> name<span>:</span> <span>"Hello"</span><span>,</span> age<span>:</span> <span>12</span> <span>}</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>
</span><span>  <span>birthdayGreeting2</span><span>(</span>person<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>
</span><span>  <span>birthdayGreeting3</span><span>(</span>person<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It's very easy to see (or use your IDE to find) all the places where <code>Person</code> is used. You can see it's initiated in <code>main</code> and you can see it's used by birthdayGreeting3<code>. However, in order to know it's used in </code>birthdayGreeting2`, you'd need to read the entire codebase.</p>
<p>The flip side of this is also that when looking at <code>birthdayGreeting2</code>, it's hard to know that it expects a <code>Person</code> as a parameter. Some of these things can be solved by exhaustive documentation, but: (1) why bother if you can achieve more with types? (2) documentation goes stale, here the code is the documentation.</p>
<p>It's very similar to how you wouldn't write code like:</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span>// a is a person</span>
</span><span><span>function</span> <span>birthdayGreeting2</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    b <span>=</span> person<span>.</span><span>name</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>    c <span>=</span> person<span>.</span><span>age</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>    <span>return</span> <span><span>`</span><span><span>${</span>b<span>}</span></span><span> will turn </span><span><span>${</span>c <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>}</span></span><span> next year!</span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You would want to use useful variable names. Typing is the same, it's just variable names on steriods.</p>
<h2 id="we-encode-everything-in-the-type-system">We encode everything in the type system</h2>
<p>At Svix we love types. In fact, we try to encode as much information as we possibly can in the type system, so that all of the errors that can be caught at compile time will be caught at compile time; and also to squeeze that extra mileage of developer experience improvements.</p>
<p>For example, Redis is a string based protocol with no inherent typing. We use Redis for caching (among other things). The problem is that all of our nice typing benefits will be lost at the Redis layer, and bugs can happen.</p>
<p>Consider the following piece of code:</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Person</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>pub</span> id<span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
</span><span>    <span>pub</span> name<span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
</span><span>    <span>pub</span> age<span>:</span> <span>u16</span><span>,</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Pet</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>pub</span> id<span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
</span><span>    <span>pub</span> owner<span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>let</span> id <span>=</span> <span>"p123"</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>let</span> person <span>=</span> <span>Person</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"John"</span><span>,</span> <span>20</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>cache<span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>format!</span><span>(</span><span>"person-{id}"</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> person<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>// ...</span>
</span><span><span>let</span> pet<span>:</span> <span>Pet</span> <span>=</span> cache<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>format!</span><span>(</span><span>"preson-{id}"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are a couple of bugs in the snippet:</p>
<ol>
<li>There's a typo in the second key name.</li>
<li>We are trying to load a person into a pet type.</li>
</ol>
<p>To avoid such issues we do two things at Svix. The first is that we require the key to be of a certain type (not a generic string), and to create this type you need to call a specific fuction. The second thing we do, is force pairing a key to a value.</p>
<p>So the above example would look something like:</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>PersonCacheKey</span><span>(</span><span>String</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>impl</span> <span>PersonCacheKey</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>fn</span> <span>new</span><span>(</span>id<span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Self</span> <span>{</span> <span>...</span> <span>}</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Person</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>pub</span> id<span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
</span><span>        <span>pub</span> name<span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
</span><span>        <span>pub</span> age<span>:</span> <span>u16</span><span>,</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>PetCacheKey</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Pet</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>pub</span> id<span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
</span><span>        <span>pub</span> owner<span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>let</span> id <span>=</span> <span>"p123"</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>let</span> person <span>=</span> <span>Person</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span>id<span>,</span> <span>"John"</span><span>,</span> <span>20</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>cache<span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>PersonCacheKey</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span>id<span>)</span><span>,</span> person<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>// ...</span>
</span><span><span>// Compilation will fail on the next line</span>
</span><span><span>let</span> pet<span>:</span> <span>Pet</span> <span>=</span> cache<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>PersonCacheKey</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span>id<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is already much better, and makes it impossible to get either of the previously mentioned bugs. Though we can do even better!</p>
<p>Consider the following function:</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span>pub</span> <span>fn</span> <span>do_something</span><span>(</span>id<span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>let</span> person<span>:</span> <span>Person</span> <span>=</span> cache<span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>PersonCacheKey</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span>id<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>    <span>// ...</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are a couple of problems with it. The first is that it's not very clear which <code>id</code> it should be for. Is it a person? A pet? It's very easy to accidentally call it with the wrong one, like in the following example:</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span>let</span> pet <span>=</span> <span>...</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>do_something</span><span>(</span>pet<span>.</span>id<span>)</span><span>;</span> <span>// &lt;-- should be pet.owner!</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The second is that we are losing the discoverability. It's a bit hard to know that a Pet has a relationship to a Person.</p>
<p>So at Svix, we have a special type for each <code>id</code> to ensure that there are no mistakes. The adjusted code looks something like:</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>PersonId</span><span>(</span><span>String</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>PetId</span><span>(</span><span>String</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Person</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>pub</span> id<span>:</span> <span>PersonId</span><span>,</span>
</span><span>    <span>pub</span> name<span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span>
</span><span>    <span>pub</span> age<span>:</span> <span>u16</span><span>,</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span><span>
</span><span><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Pet</span> <span>{</span>
</span><span>    <span>pub</span> id<span>:</span> <span>PetId</span><span>,</span>
</span><span>    <span>pub</span> owner<span>:</span> <span>PersonId</span><span>,</span>
</span><span><span>}</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is indeed much better than our previous example.</p>
<p>There is still one issue. If we accept the <code>id</code>s from the API, how do we know that they are valid? All of the pet <code>id</code>s in Svix, for example, are prefixed with <code>pet_</code> and are then followed by a Ksuid like so: <code>pet_25SVqQSCVpGZh5SmuV0A7X0E3rw</code>.</p>
<p>We want to be able to tell our customers that they pass the wrong <code>id</code> in the API, e.g. they pass a person <code>id</code> when a pet one is expected. One simple solution for this is to validate this (duh...) but it can be easy to forget to validate it everywhere that it's used.</p>
<p>So we enforce that a <code>PetId</code> can never be created without first being validated. This way we know that all of the code paths that create a <code>PetId</code> first make sure it's valid. This means that when we return a <code>404 Not Found</code> to a customer because a pet isn't found in the database, we can be sure it was actually a valid <code>id</code> that wasn't found in the database. If it wasn't a valid <code>id</code>, we would have already returned a <code>422</code> or <code>400</code> when it was passed to the API handlers.</p>
<h2 id="so-why-doesnt-everyone-like-types">So why doesn't everyone like types?</h2>
<p>The main topic of argument against types are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Development speed</li>
<li>Learning curve and types complexity</li>
<li>The amount of effort and boilerplate required</li>
</ol>
<p>First of all, I'd argue that even if all of the above were true, the advantages mentioned above are well worth the trouble. Though I also don't agree with all of the above.</p>
<p>The first one is development speed. Prototyping without types is definitely much faster. You can comment out pieces of the code and won't have a compiler complain to you. You can set the wrong values for some of the fields until you're ready to figure out the right ones, etc.</p>
<p>Though like I said above: "Writing software without types lets you go at full speed. Full speed towards the cliff." The problem is that this is just aggressive and unnecessary technical debt. You'll pay it mulitple times over when you need to debug why your code doesn't work (either locally, in the test suite, or in production).</p>
<p>As for the learning curve: Yes, learning more things takes time. Though I'd say that most people don't need to be typing experts. They can just get by with very simple type expressions, and ask if they ever hit a wall. However, if you keep things simple, you'll probably rarely if ever hit one.</p>
<p>Additionally, people are already required to learn how to code, learn frameworks (React, Axum, etc.), and so many other things. I don't think the learning burden is as significant as it's made out to be.</p>
<p>Last, but not least, regarding the learning curve: I strongly believe that the benefits of a lessened learning curve by not having to know types, are much less than the benefits of using the type script to onboard on a specific codebase. Especially since learning types is a one time cost.</p>
<p>The last point is about the amount of effort and boilerplate required to use types in your codebase. I strongly believe that the amount of effort is actually less than the amount of effort required by not writing types.</p>
<p>Not using types requires significant documentation and testing in order to reach even a basic level of sanity. Documentation can go stale, and so can testing; and either way they require more effort than just adding the right types. Reading code with types is also easier, because you get the types inline instead of in the function documentation where it's in an inconsistent format with a lot of added noise.</p>
<p>Yes, typing can be a pain in languages that don't support inference, e.g Java can be tedious:</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> It seems that Java has type inference nowadays. Thanks <code>pron</code> for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37765419">the correction on HN</a>.</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span>Person</span> person1 <span>=</span> <span>newPerson</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>Person</span> person2 <span>=</span> <span>newPerson</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>Person</span> child <span>=</span> <span>makeChild</span><span>(</span>person1<span>,</span> person2<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>while mother languages that have inference (like Rust), are much nicer:</p>
<div><pre><code><span><span>let</span> person1 <span>=</span> <span>new_person</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>let</span> person2 <span>=</span> <span>new_person</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span><span><span>let</span> child <span>=</span> <span>make_child</span><span>(</span>person1<span>,</span> person2<span>)</span><span>;</span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So having the right tools definitely helps.</p>
<p>Speaking of tools, in order to reap the benefits of your typing, you probably need to use a code editor (or IDE) that supports modern code completion that is language aware.</p>
<h2 id="closing-words">Closing words</h2>
<p>I can see both side of the arguments on many topics, such as <code>vim</code> vs. <code>emacs</code>, tabs vs. spaces, and even much more controversial ones. Though in this case, the costs are so low compared to the benefits that I just don't understand why anyone would ever choose not to use types.</p>
<p>I'd love to know what I'm missing, but until then: Strong typing is a hill I'm willing to die on.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>WASHINGTON -- FEMA, in coordination with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), will conduct a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-system/national-test-2023">nationwide test</a>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fema.gov/emergency-alert-system">Emergency Alert System</a>&nbsp;(EAS) and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-system/public/wireless-emergency-alerts">Wireless Emergency Alerts</a> (WEA)&nbsp;tomorrow, Oct. 4.</p><p>The national test will consist of two portions, testing WEA and EAS capabilities. Both tests are scheduled to begin at approximately 2:20 p.m. ET on Wednesday, Oct. 4.</p><p>The WEA portion of the test will be directed to consumer cell phones. This will be the third nationwide test, but the second test to all WEA-compatible cellular devices. The test message will display in either English or in Spanish, depending on the language settings&nbsp;of the wireless handset.</p><p>The EAS portion of the test will be sent to radios and televisions. This will be the seventh nationwide EAS test.</p><p>FEMA and the FCC are coordinating with EAS participants, wireless providers, emergency managers&nbsp;and other stakeholders in preparation for this national test to minimize confusion and maximize the public safety value of the test.</p><p>The purpose of the test is to ensure that the systems continue to be effective means of warning the public about emergencies, particularly those on the national level. In case the Oct. 4 test is postponed, due to widespread severe weather or other significant events, the back-up testing date is Oct. 11.&nbsp;</p><p>The WEA portion of the test will be initiated using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-system">FEMA’s Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS)</a>, a centralized internet-based system administered by FEMA that enables authorities to send authenticated emergency messages to the public through multiple communications networks. The WEA test will be administered via a code sent to cell phones.&nbsp;</p><p>This year the EAS message will be disseminated as a Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) message via the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System-Open Platform for Emergency Networks (IPAWS-OPEN).</p><p>All wireless phones should receive the message only once. The following can be expected from the nationwide WEA test:</p><ul><li>Beginning at approximately 2:20 p.m. ET, cell towers will broadcast the test for approximately 30 minutes. During this time, WEA-compatible wireless phones that are switched on, within range of an active cell tower, and in a geographic area where the wireless provider participates in WEA, should be capable of receiving the test message.&nbsp;</li><li>For consumers, the message that appears on their phones will read: “THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed.”</li><li>Phones with the main menu set to Spanish will display: “ESTA ES UNA PRUEBA del Sistema Nacional de Alerta de Emergencia. &nbsp;No se necesita acción.”</li><li>Similar to when your phone receives an Amber Alert, the WEA alert tone is generally only played when the alert is initially received by the phone&nbsp;and on some devices stops as soon as the user clicks a button.</li><li>If a phone is off before the test alert is sent and not turned back on until after the WEA Test expires (approximately 30 minutes), the phone should not get the test message.</li></ul><p>WEA alerts are created and sent by authorized federal, state, local, tribal and territorial government agencies through IPAWS to participating wireless providers, which deliver the alerts to compatible handsets in geo-targeted areas. To help ensure that these alerts are accessible to the entire public, including people with disabilities, the alerts are accompanied by a unique tone and vibration.&nbsp;</p><p>Important information about the EAS test:</p><ul><li>The EAS portion of the test is scheduled to last approximately one minute and will be conducted with the participation of radio and television broadcasters, cable systems, satellite radio and television providers&nbsp;and wireline video providers.</li><li>The test message will be similar to the regular monthly EAS test messages with which the public is familiar. It will state: “This is a nationwide test of the Emergency Alert System, issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, covering the United States from 14:20 to 14:50 hours ET. This is only a test. No action is required by the public."</li></ul><p><strong>Note to Broadcast Outlets:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Please do not include the tones or Attention Signals in broadcast TV or radio coverage about the Nationwide Emergency Alert Test being conducted on Oct. 4, 2023. Doing so could result in a violation of federal regulations, which prohibit the use of Emergency Alert System codes (which are audible tones) or the EAS and WEA Attention Signals, or simulations of them, except in actual emergencies, authorized tests of the EAS, or authorized Public Service Announcements (PSAs).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></description>

  <p>
    <em><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Anna’s Archive scraped all of Worldcat (the world’s largest library metadata collection) to make a TODO list of books that need to be preserved, and is hosting a data science mini-competition.</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    A year ago, we <a href="https://annas-blog.org/blog-isbndb-dump-how-many-books-are-preserved-forever.html">set out</a> to answer this question: <strong>What percentage of books have been permanently preserved by shadow libraries?</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
     Once a book makes it into an open-data shadow library like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_Genesis">Library Genesis</a>, and now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna%27s_Archive">Anna’s Archive</a>, it gets mirrored all over the world (through torrents), thereby practically preserving it forever.
  </p>

  <p>
     To answer the question of which percentage of books has been preserved, we need to know the denominator: how many books exist in total? And ideally we don’t just have a number, but actual metadata. Then we can not only match them against shadow libraries, but also <strong>create a TODO list of remaining books to preserve!</strong> We could even start dreaming of a crowdsourced effort to go down this TODO list.
  </p>

  <p>
    We scraped <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBNdb.com">ISBNdb</a>, and downloaded the <a href="https://openlibrary.org/developers/dumps">Open Library dataset</a>, but the results were unsatisfactory. The main problem was that there was not a ton of overlap of ISBNs. See this Venn diagram from <a href="https://annas-blog.org/blog-isbndb-dump-how-many-books-are-preserved-forever.html">our blog post</a>:
  </p>

  <p><img src="https://annas-blog.org/venn.svg"></p><p>
    We were very surprised by how little overlap there was between ISBNdb and Open Library, both of which liberally include data from various sources, such as web scrapes and library records. If they both do a good job at finding most ISBNs in out there, their circles surely would have substantial overlap, or one would be a subset of the other. It made us wonder, how many books fall <em>completely outside of these circles</em>? We need a bigger database.
  </p>

  <h2>Worldcat</h2>

  <p>
    That is when we set our sights on the largest book database in the world: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldCat">Worldcat</a>. This is a proprietary database by the non-profit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCLC">OCLC</a>, which aggregates metadata records from libraries all over the world, in exchange for giving those libraries access to the full dataset, and having them show up in end-users’ search results.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even though OCLC is a non-profit, their business model requires protecting their database. Well, we’re sorry to say, friends at OCLC, we’re giving it all away. :-)
  </p>

  <p>
    Over the past year, we’ve meticulously scraped all Worldcat records. At first, we hit a lucky break. Worldcat was just rolling out their complete website redesign (in Aug 2022). This included a substantial overhaul of their backend systems, introducing many security flaws. We immediately seized the opportunity, and were able scrape hundreds of millions (!) of records in mere days.
  </p>

  <p><img src="https://annas-blog.org/worldcat_redesign.png"></p><p><em>Worldcat redesign</em></p>

  <p>
    After that, security flaws were slowly fixed one by one, until the final one we found was patched about a month ago. By that time we had pretty much all records, and were only going for slightly higher quality records. So we felt it is time to release!
  </p>

  <p>
    Let’s look at some basic information on the data:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Format?</strong> <a href="https://annas-blog.org/annas-archive-containers.html">Anna’s Archive Containers (AAC)</a>, which is essentially <a href="https://jsonlines.org/">JSON Lines</a> compressed with <a href="http://www.zstd.net/">Zstandard</a>, plus some standardized semantics. These containers wrap various types of records, based on the different scrapes we deployed.</li>
    <li><strong>Where?</strong> On the torrents page of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna%27s_Archive">Anna’s Archive</a>. We can’t link to it directly from here. Filename: <code>annas_archive_meta__aacid__worldcat__20231001T025039Z--20231001T235839Z.jsonl.zst.torrent</code>.</li>
    <li><strong>Size?</strong> 220GB compressed, 2.2TB uncompressed. 1.3 billion unique IDs (1,348,336,870), covered by 1.8 billion records (1,888,381,236), so 540 million duplicates (29%). 600 million are redirects or 404s, so <strong>700 million unique actual records</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Is that a lot?</strong> Yes. For comparison, Open Library has 47 million records, and ISBNdb has 34 million. Anna’s Archive has 125 million files, but with many duplicates, and most are papers from Sci-Hub (98 million).</li>
    <li><strong>What?</strong> Worldcat library records, merged from ~30,000 OCLC member libraries. Mostly books, but also magazines, journals, dissertations, physical artifacts, and so on. We only captured the records themselves, not holding information (e.g. which library has which items).</li>
    <li><strong>Scraping quality?</strong> This varies between our different collection methods. The vast majority of records are “Title JSON”, which contains a good amount of information. There are some records we only managed to scrape through bulk HTML searches, containing only basic information like title, author, and ISBN.</li>
    <li><strong>Primary key?</strong> The IDs of Worldcat records are known as “OCLC IDs”, and appear to be incrementing numbers, ranging from 1 to (when we started our scrape) about 1,350,000,000, which is the range we scraped for. However, due to how some of our scraping methods work, we also found other ranges, that seem different from the main set starting at 1.</li>
    <li><strong>Examples?</strong> Canoncial URLs of these records are of the form <code>worldcat.org/oclc/:id</code>, which currently redirects to <code>worldcat.org/title/:id</code>. For example, <a href="https://worldcat.org/oclc/528432361">https://worldcat.org/oclc/528432361</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Competition</h2>

  <p>
    Before we dive into the data, we have to acknowledge that we haven’t had a chance yet to dive very deep into this massive dataset. That’s why we’re inviting the world to have a go at it, in a mini-competition. We’re curious what you will discover!
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>The 3 best submissions by 2023-12-01 will win a year-long membership of Anna’s Archive</strong> at the highest tier (“Amazing Archivist”), which includes the ability to include your own name or message in one of our torrent filenames. We will also feature your work in a blog post.
  </p>

  <p>
    For this mini-competition, anything goes, as long as you share your analysis publicly, e.g. in an open source repository or notebook. Send your submissions to <a href="https://annas-blog.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#db9ab5b5ba9aa9b8b3b2adb2a8af9baba9b4afb4b5f5b6be"><span data-cfemail="c382adada282b1a0abaab5aab0b783b3b1acb7acadedaea6">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>. We will pick the three submissions we think are most interesing, inspiring, and insightful.
  </p>

  <p>
    Join us in the <a href="https://t.me/+GNQxkFPt1xkzY2Zk">devs &amp; translators Telegram group</a> to discuss what you’re working on! And check out our <a href="https://annas-software.org/AnnaArchivist/annas-archive/-/tree/main/data-imports">data imports</a> scripts, for comparing against various other metadata datasets.
  </p>

  <p>
    If instead of data science, you’re more interested in helping us do more scrapes like this, then definitely contact us right away. We’re always looking for programmers, offensive security researchers (hackers), and so on.
  </p>

  <h2>Data</h2>

  <p>
    We haven’t looked too deeply into the different fields yet, and documentation is sparse. We’ll have to fill in a lot of gaps ourselves.
  </p>

  <h3>Official API</h3>

  <p>
    Let’s first look at an official API response. To use their API, you have to be a member library, but luckily the docs are public and <a href="https://developer.api.oclc.org/wcv2#/Bibliographic%20Resources/retrieve-bib">include an example</a>, which is for <a href="https://worldcat.org/oclc/311684437">this book</a>:

    From the <code>title.mainTitles.0.text</code> field we can see that they chose the example of <em>“Pride and prejudice and zombies : the classic regency romance--now with ultraviolent zombie mayhem / by Jane Austen and Seth Grahame-Smith.”</em> I will say, this makes me immediately like the OCLC people some more. :-)
  </p>

  <p>
    There is a lot of incredible information here, a lot of which we unfortunately do not have access to in our various scraping methods. For example, there are references to other numbering systems, such as LCCN, Dewey Decimal, and a long list of <code>externalIdentifiers</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some information in this API is only available in a subset of our scraping methods. For example, the "work ID", which is useful to cluster similar works, is available in our “providerSearchRequest” records.
  </p>

  <h3>Redirects</h3>

  <p>
    One of our simplest scraping types is “redirect_title_json”. This occurs when we make a request for a certain OCLC ID, but receive data for another OCLC ID. When this happens we can infer that these records have been merged, e.g. by a deduplication process. Indeed, for the <code>mergedOclcNumbers</code> in the official API, we can find the first of those redirects in our scrape:
  </p>

  <p><code>{"aacid":"aacid__worldcat__20230929T222220Z__261176486__kPkdUa7GVRadsU2hitoHNb","metadata":{"oclc_number":261176486,"type":"redirect_title_json","from_filenames":["w2/v7/1062/1062959057"],"record":{"redirected_oclc_number":311684437}}}</code></p><p>
    In this record you can also see the container JSON (per the <a href="https://annas-blog.org/annas-archive-containers.html">Anna’s Archive Container format</a>), as well as the metadata of which scrape file this record originates from (which we included in case it is somehow useful).
  </p>

  <h3>Title JSON</h3>

  <p>
    The main type of record we have is “title_json”. This is the JSON that is loaded when going to a <code>worldcat.org/title/:id</code> page. It can either be embedded in the page itself, or made with a separate request. We have not observed a difference in these two origins.
  </p>

  <p>
    For <em>“Pride and prejudice and zombies”</em> this looks like this:

    This is mostly a subset of the official API, though this does contain some metadata indicating that this Jane Austen is not an actual author, but a "parody of" relationship (the <code>http://rdaregistry.info/Elements/w/P10197</code>) at the very end. It is unclear if the official API example is simply outdated and nowadays also includes this, or if this is actual unique information to this scraping method.

  <p>
    We think this release marks a major milestone in mapping out all the books in the world. We can now work on making a TODO list of all the books that still need to be preserved.

  <p>
    Join us: enter in our mini-competition to analyze these data, help seed our torrents, scan and upload some books, help build Anna’s Archive, help scrape more collections, or simply become a member. We’ve already met dozens of incredible volunteers, and <em>you too</em> can help preserve humanity’s legacy.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Special call for LLM companies and groups:</strong> we recently launched a special program on Anna’s Archive to help out teams building LLMs with high-speed access to our collections.

  <p>
    Thanks everyone.

    PS: We do want to give a genuine shout-out to the Worldcat team. Even though it was a small tragedy that your data was locked up, you did an amazing job at getting 30,000 libraries on board to share their metadata with you. As with many of our releases, we could not have done it without the decades of hard work you put into building the collections that we now liberate. Truly: thank you.

<p>Oddly, the single keynote address at the event to celebrate GNU’s 40th birthday in Biel, Switzerland wasn’t scheduled at the start of the day, but in the early afternoon, at 2 pm local time. This eccentric scheduling only seemed to make sense, given the fact that the speaker was Richard Stallman, GNU’s founder who has always marched to his own beat.</p>
<p>Officially billed as a “hacker meeting,” Biel’s GNU community pretty much pulled out all of the stops for a relatively small one-day event. The speakers’ roster included the likes of Nextcloud co-founder Björn Schießle who talked about “The Next 40 years of Free Software”; Matthias Kirschner, president of FSFE who opened the day with “The FSFE’s Work: An Overview for Free Software Hackers”; and Swiss Parliament member Jörg Mäder, who was on hand to talk about GNU Taler, GNU’s privacy-aware online payment system.</p>
<p>In all, the day was filled with 14 presentations if you include Stallman’s middle of the day keynote.</p>
<h2>RMS Takes Center Stage</h2>
<p>I could be wrong, but my guess is that despite the impressive speaker’s list, for many in attendance, RMS’s appearance was the event’s centerpiece. That’s interesting, considering that several years back it appeared to many of us as if Stallman would spend the rest of his life in exile. Perseverance evidently pays off.</p>
<p>His talk was short, lasting only about 25 minutes. Except for <a href="https://fossforce.com/2023/09/rmss-cancer-linuxs-shrinking-support-googs-privacy-sandbox-naming-opensuse-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the big reveal</a> at the beginning about his having cancer, it was pretty much a classic RMS talk, with a focus on Red Hat, artificial intelligence, and why kids don’t think free software is cool (hint: it has to do with wanting to be popular, which evidently was never an issue for Stallman).</p>

<p>This being Stallman, “free software” ruled the day, with the phrase being uttered 13 times during his 25 minutes. “Open-source,” on the other hand, wasn’t spoken even once.</p>
<h2>Red Hat and the GPL</h2>
<p>After a brief mention of his current bout with cancer (at the event he said that he has “a kind of lymphoma,” but later in the day clarified on his website that he’s being treated for follicular lymphoma, which he called “slow-growing and manageable), Stallman talked about Red Hat’s support contracts, which forbid customers from distributing Red Hat’s open-source software. He said the practice might not violate the GPL (“I don’t have a conclusive answer to that”), but that its approach is “antisocial.”</p>
<p>“They’re threatening to cancel support contracts for users that do what they’re supposed to be able to do, which is to redistribute the free software they’re getting from Red Hat, and this Red Hat should stop,” he said. “There’s a separate aspect, which is that support customers have to pay based on how many users are getting the support and how many machines the support is for. That’s a secondary issue that I don’t think is remarkable. The crucial thing is that they’re trying to stop users from redistributing the software, since redistribution is what it [the GPL] is for. I hope the community’s influence will make Red Hat change that aspect of contracts.”</p>
<h2>There’s Nothing Intelligent About Generative AI</h2>
<p>When it comes to artificial intelligence, especially of the generative ChatGPT variety, Stallman seems to think that much of the danger is coming from the narrative that the AI marketers are weaving.</p>
<p>“As I see it, ‘intelligence’ needs something like the ability to know or understand some area,” he said. “If something can’t actually understand things we shouldn’t say it’s intelligent, not even a little intelligent, but people are using the term artificial intelligence for bullshit generators.”</p>

<p>He said that systems like ChatGPT “don’t understand anything and don’t know anything.”</p>
<p>“The only thing that they’re good at is making smooth-sounding output, any part of which could be bullshit,” he said. “You can’t believe it ever — well, you’re dumb if you do — so I won’t call those ‘artificial intelligence’ or anything with the word ‘intelligence’ in it, because that encourages people to think that what they [generative AI programs] are saying is not bullshit. It encourages people to believe them, and that gives them the chance to do great harm.”</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that Stallman  thinks that true artificial intelligence doesn’t exist, however. He says it does, and that it’s being used both to make a positive difference in the world, as well as to line the pockets of tech shysters with self-serving intent.</p>
<p>“There are programs that can look at a photo of some magnified cells and tell you, with greater likelihood of being right than any human doctor, whether it’s cancerous or not,” he said. “There are artificial intelligence systems that can very effectively figure out what’s going to attract people’s attention. These are used by anti-social media platforms, and sad to say, they work very well. They’re very good at what they do, but what they do is get users addicted.”</p>

<p>It shouldn’t be surprising that RMS doesn’t appear to be a supporter of so-called “ethical” software licenses, that attempt to regulate who can use software, or for what purpose. It’s “not surprising,” because the first of Stallman’s four essential freedoms that serve as the backbone of the free software philosophy he advocates is the freedom to run software anyway the user wishes and for any purpose.</p>
<p>He didn’t specifically mention ethical licenses by name during his talk, but they were definitely inferred when he discussed ways of dealing with the dangers that artificial intelligence pose.</p>
<p>“We have to realize that if there are things we don’t want programs to be used for, the way to achieve this is by making it illegal to use programs to do that,” he said. “Software licenses are not the right way to prevent a program from being used harmfully. That’s not what software licenses are effective for. They’re not powerful enough to achieve that goal. And because they’re chosen by private entities, it’s undemocratic for those choices to be made by those private entities.”</p>
<p>Stallman said that in cases where the use of software poses a social threat, that use should be regulated by the rule of law rather than by software licensing.</p>
<p>“It’s legitimate for democratic countries to pass a law saying you can’t run a platform designed to maximize users engagement,” he said. “It’s not legitimate for someone who wrote a program and published it to put on it a license with that same condition, because private entity shouldn’t have this type of power over other entities, over people.”</p>
<p>“This is not the first time we’ve seen people try to do this. There are various software licenses that people publish that restrict what a program can be used for, and they always do wrong,” he added, and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/programs-must-not-limit-freedom-to-run" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pointed to an article</a> he wrote on the GNU website about this aspect of ethical licenses some time back. “The situation is unchanged. The real problems of AI, the harmful uses like deep fakes, they should be prohibited by law, and individuals should not make these laws but governments should.”</p>
<p>So what about Stallman’s “bullshit generators,” the ChatGPT-style generative AI programs that can’t be trusted to tell the truth or not hallucinate? They should be regulated too, according to Stallman.</p>
<p>“One thing is perhaps a labeling requirements,” he said. “Publishing any outputs made by a bullshit generator or in part by a bullshit generator should have to have a label saying ‘this was generated by a language model, don’t believe anything is true.’ That might help. And in general, not calling it artificial intelligence, not supporting the belief that they’re anything but gobbledygook. Expecting to find errors in whatever they say, this will help society become somewhat resistant to the harm that they can do.”</p>
<h2>Getting Youngsters Interested in Free Software</h2>
<p>Towards the end of his talk, Stallman wandered into territory that offered a glimpse of insight into his lack of social skills that have been extensively covered by the press, discussed on social platforms, and which Stallman himself offered as an excuse after controversial comments he made in 2019 about one of Jeffrey Epstein’s victims led to his temporary resignation from the board at the Free Software Foundation, an organization he founded in 1985.</p>
<p>“How do we get young people interested in free software?” he asked, calling the question “one of the conundrums we face in our community.”</p>
<p>“Children sometimes can get interested in free software,” he said as an answer to his own question. “I’m afraid that there is a problem that happens once the calamity of peer pressure sets in. I was safe from peer pressure. I was completely out of popularity. I gave up on trying to be popular. I just said it’s a waste of time for me to do anything trying to be popular so I won’t bother, and so I was safe. And there are some others who are safe.</p>
<p>“Maybe we can find them and interest them in free software so that they can find a community of people that is not so superficially focused on imitating everybody before everybody else imitates each other. Maybe. But we can also look at the anti-social media platforms that exacerbate this affect, the platforms on which people are trying to compete with each other to do stupid things, and all the other terrible effects that they have, which include causing psychological illnesses, suicide, lunacy, terrible suspicion of each other… I don’t have children, I don’t work with children, but I read about these things and they sound pretty damn horrible.”</p>
<p>By this point he had come full circle, and Stallman was back to being Stallman.</p>
<p>“Maybe if we prohibited recommendation engines that are designed to encourage people to be more engaged in whatever platform they’re on, all these problems might become less,” he said. “There is no reason in the world why these companies should be allowed to do whatever profits them the most, and designing their recommendation engines to suit their desires is not what we have understood freedom of expression to mean.</p>
<p>“It’s not really expression of anything. It’s freedom of manipulation; freedom of engineering people’s brains to be ideal victims. Maybe that’s something society needs to prohibit.”</p>

Ostensibly, the retail firm is the lowest price option in the market, and it offers “free shipping” to over 100 million Amazon Prime customers, for which it charges a $139 a year membership fee. The revenue from Prime does not come close to covering the cost of its logistics arm, which was $85 billion in 2022. According to one J.P. Morgan analyst, the </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/select/amazon-prime-is-it-worth-it/" rel="">actual value of Prime is roughly $1,000</a><span> for a customer, which means that Amazon is subsidizing its Prime business to the tune of tens of billions of dollars a year. Where is this money coming from? To put it differently, how can Amazon be the lowest-cost retailer and offer free shipping, all while making money?</span></p><p><span>A lot of people have tried to argue that this is some grand technological feat, or business genius. But the answer, as it turns out, is that there is no such thing as a free lunch. Consumers pay for the free shipping, it’s just a hidden tax baked into the price of what you buy through an extraordinarily clever scheme put forward by Amazon. And that’s what the Federal Trade Commission and 17 states are suing over. This hidden tax is well-known in the industry.

As one former Amazon executive explained in recalling Amazon's motivation for adding non-shipping services to Prime, ‘[a]ny competitor might launch a Prime shipping clone, or they could potentially build a new Netflix-type service, but it was unlikely that any one of them would be able to do both.’”</p></blockquote><p>Amazon’s strategy is to use Prime to build, extend, and fortify barriers to entry. One result of Prime is that Amazon now has an overwhelming monopoly share of online shoppers. And online shoppers aren’t the customer, but the product that Amazon brokers to third-party sellers, who  must either pay Amazon what it demands or lose access to the market. As one seller put it, "We have nowhere else to go and Amazon knows it." </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea0cf560-2f53-4e96-9d1b-4357d79ffbd0_1102x806.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea0cf560-2f53-4e96-9d1b-4357d79ffbd0_1102x806.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea0cf560-2f53-4e96-9d1b-4357d79ffbd0_1102x806.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea0cf560-2f53-4e96-9d1b-4357d79ffbd0_1102x806.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea0cf560-2f53-4e96-9d1b-4357d79ffbd0_1102x806.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea0cf560-2f53-4e96-9d1b-4357d79ffbd0_1102x806.png" width="1102" height="806" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ea0cf560-2f53-4e96-9d1b-4357d79ffbd0_1102x806.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:806,&quot;width&quot;:1102,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:436864,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea0cf560-2f53-4e96-9d1b-4357d79ffbd0_1102x806.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea0cf560-2f53-4e96-9d1b-4357d79ffbd0_1102x806.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea0cf560-2f53-4e96-9d1b-4357d79ffbd0_1102x806.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea0cf560-2f53-4e96-9d1b-4357d79ffbd0_1102x806.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Once it achieved monopoly power, Amazon squeezed on price through fees to third-party sellers. As a third-party seller, you pay fees for listing on Amazon; for using Amazon’s warehouse services, known as Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA); and for advertising services. If you don’t pay, you don’t get put in a place on the site where consumers click. "Advertised products on Amazon,” reads the complaint, “are 46 times more likely to be clicked on when compared with products that are not advertised." And these fees have all increased steadily over the years.</p><p><span>At this point, the price Amazon charges these third party sellers has grown to nearly 50% of its revenue. It is this money, </span><a href="https://cdn.ilsr.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/AmazonMonopolyTollbooth-2023.pdf" rel="">estimated at $123 billion</a><span> in total last year, that pays for “free” shipping, as well as its video service, its music service, Twitch, and everything else that comes bundled with Prime. These third-party sellers in turn raise their prices to consumers, aka you and me, and then send that money back to Amazon in the form of fees. It’s basically money laundering.</span></p><p>This dynamic increasingly ruins the consumer experience. Amazon is now so full of pay-to-play ads that consumers are complaining they can’t find organic results, but are instead directed to higher priced items. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee348173-8c7f-4e8b-9701-5c5bba57d27c_855x479.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee348173-8c7f-4e8b-9701-5c5bba57d27c_855x479.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee348173-8c7f-4e8b-9701-5c5bba57d27c_855x479.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee348173-8c7f-4e8b-9701-5c5bba57d27c_855x479.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee348173-8c7f-4e8b-9701-5c5bba57d27c_855x479.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee348173-8c7f-4e8b-9701-5c5bba57d27c_855x479.png" width="855" height="479" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ee348173-8c7f-4e8b-9701-5c5bba57d27c_855x479.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:479,&quot;width&quot;:855,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:399812,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee348173-8c7f-4e8b-9701-5c5bba57d27c_855x479.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee348173-8c7f-4e8b-9701-5c5bba57d27c_855x479.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee348173-8c7f-4e8b-9701-5c5bba57d27c_855x479.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee348173-8c7f-4e8b-9701-5c5bba57d27c_855x479.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>In the red box are sponsored links, which are hard to distinguish from organic best results.</figcaption></figure></div><p>As the FTC noted, one “senior Amazon executive reportedly compared Amazon's advertising and search divisions to the parable of the scorpion and the frog: it was in the advertising division's nature as the proverbial ‘scorpion’ to poison organic search results."</p><p>Still, why can’t a third-party seller offer a lower price outside of Amazon? Good question! That’s where the scheme gets very clever. Originally, Amazon imposed contracts, as the FTC noted, “barring all sellers from offering their goods for lower prices anywhere else.” But Europeans, and Senator Richard Blumenthal, complained about these price parity agreements, so Amazon dropped its explicit contractual requirements in 2019. </p><p><span>However, this change was a farce. The firm simply did through code what it couldn’t do through contract. "Amazon,” claims the FTC, “has implemented an algorithm for the express purpose of deterring other online stores from offering lower prices." Just weeks after dropping this requirement, Amazon wrote it would not </span><a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-reveals-additional-evidence-antitrust-violations-lawsuit" rel="">change its policies</a><span>, as California’s attorney general revealed in April. The firm even speculated that “media and selling partners may claim the removal of the clause was not only trivial but a trick and an attempt to garner goodwill with policymakers amid increasing competition concerns.”</span></p><p>Today, Amazon tells sellers that if it detects a lower price for their products on any other online store, they will be punished, which is to say, their ability to get their products onto a place on the Amazon website where customers click will go away. The net effect, as Amazon itself wrote, is that "prices will go up."</p><p><span>Indeed, Amazon tells third-party sellers to </span><a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-reveals-additional-evidence-antitrust-violations-lawsuit" rel="">raise prices</a><span>. In 2019, a seller complained to Amazon that they were being asked “to take our prices down [on&nbsp;Amazon] to match our own [website] store.”&nbsp;Amazon’s VP of Pricing told the seller’s account manager that “[Y]ou might want to ask him to check if his sales on other sites directly or through distributors is&nbsp;putting him and us at a relative competitive disadvantage…&nbsp; He might&nbsp;get the hint. :)”</span></p><p><span>If this whole scheme sounds familiar, it’s because I described it in May of 2021 when then-D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine filed a similar though much less developed suit, in a piece called </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/amazon-primes-free-shipping-promise" rel="">“Amazon Prime Is an Economy-Distorting Lie.”</a><span> Racine left out some key details, and got a bad judge, so that case was dismissed, though it’s on appeal. California Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a very similar suit, which has </span><a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-secures-court-decision-denying-amazon%E2%80%99s-attempt-evade" rel="">survived important procedural elements</a><span> and will go to trial. Another related suit, this one class action, in Washington state also passed a summary judgment.</span></p><p><span>The overall point is that Amazon is degrading the shopping experience, raising prices, and yet somehow still gaining market share. It is able to block third-party sellers from going elsewhere, and therefore also stop potential rivals from gaining share. It’s a fairly strong complaint, and while antitrust cases are always random, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/billbaer50/status/1706745133922767041" rel="">Bill Baer</a><span>, the former Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust under the Obama administration, said it’s a strong argument. “If the FTC and states can prove even some of the factual allegations in this 172 page complaint,” he said, “Amazon is in a world of hurt.”</span></p><p><span>If this suit is resolved in the government’s favor, the remedy could be anything from ending anti-discounting measures to breaking up the firm. Regardless, there will be lower prices and discounting all over the web, and a lot of new firms will be able to enter the market. As one legal analyst told me last year, “Let's say a product today is sold for $10 on Amazon with 'free shipping'. If Amazon is forced to unbundle the FBA fee from the product price then it would cost $6 + $4 shipping. Prime makes no sense in this world unless Amazon again decided to subsidize Prime.” And even Amazon doesn’t have the tens of billions of dollars required to do that. Indeed, the stakes here are one reason that antitrust legend Bill Kovacic </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/27/ftc-bill-kovacic-amazon-khan-00118353" rel="">called</a><span> the Amazon complaint “the most important case that the FTC has brought in its 109-year history.”</span></p><p><span>One of the more disturbing trends in antitrust is how secretive courts have become on antitrust matters. I wrote this up on Sunday in </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/how-to-hide-a-2-trillion-antitrust" rel="">my piece</a><span> on how Judge Amit Mehta is hiding the Google trial, and </span><em>the New York Times</em><span> did a big story on </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/26/technology/google-antitrust-trial-secrecy.html" rel="">the “unprecedented” secrecy</a><span> of the trial, which does seem to have embarrassed Mehta. Journalists are getting increasingly angry over these redactions and closed sessions, because they want to write about stuff, and when you remove all the interesting tidbits it means they can’t. (The same journalists who cover the Google trial are also covering the Amazon complaint.)</span></p><p>Much of the interesting information in this Amazon complaint is redacted, including two particular elements I want to highlight. The first is that Amazon, like Google, has been destroying documents and internal conversations. The extent of their perfidy is not clear, since the paragraph alleging wrongdoing is redacted.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc24032c-69d0-476f-933c-3db0be2ac2ea_1566x534.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc24032c-69d0-476f-933c-3db0be2ac2ea_1566x534.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc24032c-69d0-476f-933c-3db0be2ac2ea_1566x534.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc24032c-69d0-476f-933c-3db0be2ac2ea_1566x534.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc24032c-69d0-476f-933c-3db0be2ac2ea_1566x534.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc24032c-69d0-476f-933c-3db0be2ac2ea_1566x534.png" width="1456" height="496" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bc24032c-69d0-476f-933c-3db0be2ac2ea_1566x534.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:496,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:574817,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc24032c-69d0-476f-933c-3db0be2ac2ea_1566x534.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc24032c-69d0-476f-933c-3db0be2ac2ea_1566x534.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc24032c-69d0-476f-933c-3db0be2ac2ea_1566x534.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc24032c-69d0-476f-933c-3db0be2ac2ea_1566x534.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The second is something called Project Nessie, which is an algorithmic pricing system so egregious that the FTC determined that it deserved its own charge as an unfair method of competition.

To access the legacy IPv4 Internet, I use a NAT64 gateway based on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.litech.org/tayga/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tayga</a>&nbsp;deployed on a&nbsp;<a href="https://pine64.com/product-category/rockpro64/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RockPro64</a>&nbsp;SBC in my cupboard:</p>

<p>Most of the apps I use support IPv6 but there are some cases when a lack of IPv4 connectivity on my machine negatively affects the experience.</p>



<p>One of the cases that affect my daily experience is the constant need to manually prepend IPv4 addresses for SSH as direct attempts to use SSH with an IPv4 address fail:</p>



<pre><code>ssh 1.3.3.7
ssh: connect to host 1.3.3.7 port 22: Network is unreachable</code></pre>



<p>Instead, I have to constantly append my IPv6 NAT64 prefix:</p>



<pre><code>ssh 64:ff9b::1.3.3.7
pavel@64:ff9b::103:307's password:</code></pre>



<p>Luckily, Linux provides an exceptionally easy way to intercept some specific library functions using a simple dynamically linked library: LD_PRELOAD.</p>



<figure><a href="https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fig2-2.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="149" src="https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fig2-2-1024x149.png" alt="Figure 2 — LD_PRELOAD allows us to override some functions with our own logic." srcset="https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fig2-2-1024x149.png 1024w, https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fig2-2-300x44.png 300w, https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fig2-2-768x112.png 768w, https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fig2-2-624x91.png 624w, https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fig2-2-1320x192.png 1320w, https://blog.apnic.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fig2-2.png 1333w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>Figure 2 — LD_PRELOAD allows us to override some functions with our own logic.</figcaption></figure>



<p>When an app needs to connect to the network it uses Linux system functions such as&nbsp;<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socket.2.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">socket</a>(),&nbsp;<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/connect.2.html?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">connect</a>(),&nbsp;<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getpeername.2.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">getpeername</a>(),&nbsp;and <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getsockname.2.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">getsockname</a>(), and by overriding them with functions that explicitly transform all IPv4 connection attempts to special IPv6 addresses crafted using a NAT64 prefix, we can automatically add IPv6 support for apps with IPv6 support.</p>



<p>Thankfully, that’s exactly how a tool called <a href="https://github.com/andrewshadura/tnat64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TNAT64</a>&nbsp;works. You can find this tool in the Debian or Ubuntu official repositories and installation is easy:</p>



<pre><code>sudo apt install -y tnat64</code></pre>



<p>TNAT64 provides a single dynamic library available on the following path: </p>



<pre><code>/usr/lib/tnat64/libtnat64.so.</code></pre>



<p>To enable it for a specific session in the terminal, we need to run the following commands:</p>



<pre><code>export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/tnat64/libtnat64.so TNAT64_DEBUG=10 TNAT64_DEBUG_FILE=/tmp/tnat64.log</code></pre>



<p>The only mandatory requirement here is that LD_PRELOAD, TNAT64_DEBUG, and TNAT64_DEBUG_FILE enable debugging to provide more information on how this library works.</p>



<p>After that, when you run any app in the same terminal session it will load <tt>libtnat64.so</tt> first. Then all calls to network functions will be intercepted, and as a consequence, any attempt to connect to IPv4 will work just fine even on a machine without external IPv4 connectivity:</p>



<pre><code>ssh 1.3.3.7
pavel@1.3.3.7's password:</code></pre>



<p>I recommend using this approach only for apps with clear IPv6 support issues. Attempts to enable this logic may lead to some issues as some apps may have issues with syscalls.</p>



<p>To get more information about the runtime activity of&nbsp;TNAT64&nbsp;you can check the content of its log file <tt>/tmp/tnat64.log</tt>:</p>

			<p>I love books and I enjoy reading through the Hacker News(<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN</a>) book recommendation threads.  On HN, there’s almost 200 stories so far this year that have the separate word “book” in the title, and aren’t linked to another page.  I wondered what the most commonly recommended or mention books are.  Mainly wondering if <a href="https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf">SICP</a> or <a href="https://gigamonkeys.com/book/">PCL</a> would be the top recommendation.</p>
<p>After reading of the man who <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35073603">categorised his favourite podcast into dewey decimal using GPT</a>, I was aware that the GPT API could be used to categorise data and output the information in json format.  So using the HN data fetched from the hackernews API, I used the subset of stories that seem to be book recommendation threads and extracted book titles, authors and urls from the text using calls to the Chat Completions API.</p>
<p>Here’s the top 50 book recommendations:</p>

<p>Some things I discovered while doing this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the API doesn’t return valid JSON, usually this is when chatGPT is saying things
like “I apologize for the confusion…” or “You’re welcome! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.”, in response to a HN comment that just says “thanks” or asks a question.</li>
<li>Designed the prompt so that I can discard responses with empty titles.  This is because I was unable to get chatgpt to stop including mentions of Authors without a title of a particular book.</li>
<li>Processing 57k comments cost about $40 using gpt 3.5 turbo API.</li>
<li>Even with a temperature of 0, GPT’s results vary from call to call.  <a href="https://152334h.github.io/blog/non-determinism-in-gpt-4/">Others have noticed this effect</a>
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37006224">(HN discussion)</a>, it’s not just GPT-4 that is non-deterministic - GPT 3.5 turbo exhibits greater variability
compared to earlier GPT-3 models.</li>
<li>It can identify links from the text, but I had to remove the html <!-- raw HTML omitted --> tag and just leave the url otherwise GPT would pick up the truncated link text instead of the URL.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s an example of the json output by chatgpt, for <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=80984">this comment</a>, it got everything wrong except the link, but it shows the format of the data:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json">[

  }
]
</code></pre></div><p>Edit: someone has asked for the prompt, here it is:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python">prompt <span>=</span> [
            {<span>"role"</span>: <span>"system"</span>, <span>"content"</span>: <span>"Assistant that identifies book titles and authors in the following document and shows the words you match to a book title from.

Don't include the book's subtitle. If the text is asking for a recommendation, without mentioning a book, then return an empty array. Provide your answer in a json array."</span>}
            {<span>"role"</span>: <span>"user"</span>, <span>"content"</span>: <span>'Wren</span><span>\'</span><span>s Explosion https://www.amazon.com/gp/395, and any Plath."'</span>},

        ]
</code></pre></div><h3 id="the-data">The Data</h3>
<p>Because I enjoy working with data and think you might find it interesting to analyse the results, here’s the <a href="https://blog.reyem.dev/code/bookdata.zip">raw data produced by GPT</a>
, sorted by title.  Note there’s a match column in there which includes an excerpt
of the comment where the book was identified.  I also normalised the book titles, lowercasing and removing ‘the’ if present at the start, and removed any subtitles.  This enabled me to query the top books without missing too many items due to inconsistence in the names that gpt came up with.</p>
<p>Here is the input <a href="https://blog.reyem.dev/code/inputs.zip">data in zipped csv format</a>, it expands out to a 24 MB file.</p>
<h4 id="note">Note</h4>
<p>I have added an amazon affiliate links to amazon urls in the tables above, mainly as a learning exercise.</p>

There is such a disconnect between the requirements on job post and actual job. As a result, all entry level people are forced to apply to 300-400 jobs at least. And you are all looking for programmers. If one thing I know is most of them are having a heck of fun creating their automated system.</p><p>I know it's annoying to you but it is equally annoying to us. I hope the upper management learns something out of this. Compile a presentation and show it to upper management. If they don't do something, expect more weird stuffs down the line.</p><p>I think your upper management will force your senior engineers to come with a filter and we will come with ways to bypass the filter. The race to the bottom is on.

Just getting to talk to a human is a massive effort in the hiring process. Before that it’s create an account on workday, have it automatically fill in the form with a pdf resume but it doesn’t change anything because I still have to go through it and make sure everything is correct, decide if I want to put effort into writing a cover letter, fill in all the manual questionnaires like “why do you want to work for us?” that I’m comfortable with, wait 2+ weeks for the automated rejection email, repeat!<p>This is also precious coming from an industry that uses automated emails for rejection. Yeah you don’t want to write 80 personalized rejection emails (probably way more) aaaand we don’t want to write 80 (or more) cover letters. I feel that’s pretty fair.</p><p>Also isn’t this the industry that uses keywords to automatically detect “good” resumes and skips the resumes that don’t have those keywords?

It was basically a general template about me, listing relevant  skills and interests, a blank variable for company name, and then an area where I could say why I wanted to work for XYZ.</p><p>Made that part of the process so much easier.</p><p>Interestingly, being on the other side, when I’ve reviewed candidate applications before phone screens or interviews, I always enjoyed reading cover letters.

Now suddenly applicants can automate just the writing of the cover letter and suddenly automation is bad and it’s all about being personal and what happened to the human touch lmao. This is just over a cover letter, by the way.</p><p>Also this is likely not applicants that are filling out one job application. We’re talking applicants that have probably spent weeks trying to apply for jobs. Spare then the 5 minutes of writing a cover letter for a job they’re probably not going to get for the 50th or whatever time.

In the case of larger organizations like Facebook, to mention one example, cover letters are overwhelmingly unlikely to have any impact. It’s highly probable that they won’t even be reviewed, and even if they are, they won’t significantly influence your chances if you can’t successfully navigate the interview process.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37740448">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37740448</a></p><p>[2] <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/credcore/people/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.linkedin.com/company/credcore/people/</a></p><p>I remember when I applied for one of my previous jobs at a relatively small game studio with about 120 employees. The CEO took the time to read every single cover letter they received. This was possible because the number of applicants was manageable, and they genuinely cared about understanding what kind of work each candidate was passionate about. I made sure to convey my genuine passion for the industry in my cover letter, and as a result, I secured a position that aligned perfectly with my interests at the time: learning about and developing distributed systems.</p><p>Later on, the company was acquired by a major player in the gaming industry. Although the HR department continued to collect cover letters, there was no longer anyone available to read and assess them.</p><p>When I applied for a job at Apple, I submitted a cover letter with the hope that, at some point during the interview process, perhaps towards the very end, someone would take the time to read it. I thought maybe the hiring manager or some higher-level managers might review it. However, a few weeks into my new job during the onboarding process, I asked some people I had met during the interviews, <i>“By the way, regarding the content of my cover letter, what were your thoughts?”</i> To my surprise, not a single person could recall ever reading or even seeing a cover letter from any candidate.

They should be absolutely plain and professional—you <i>must</i> use some kind of fancy design to stand out from the crowd.<p>In general, my understanding has been that the résumé should be showing what you've done, learned, and can do, while the cover letter should tell why you'd be good at doing it <i>there</i> in particular. But I've seen job ads that had very specific things listed as expectations for cover letters, and I've seen stories from hiring managers who act exasperated that "no one" has these particular elements to their cover letters (or résumés), which were never communicated, and seem to just be that particular hiring manager's random expectations.</p><p>It would be <i>great</i> if there were some kind of standardized format for all of this information, and some assurance that companies that try to buck the standard will suffer for it, but we really don't have that.

However, here are some general tips that might help:<p>1. Too Perfect: If the language is too polished, without any flaws, it might be a sign. However, this is not conclusive as many humans also produce impeccable cover letters.</p><p>2. Generic Content: AI-generated content might be overly generic, lacking personal anecdotes, or specific experiences that tie the candidate to the position.</p><p>3. Mismatched Details: Sometimes AI might include details or skills that don't necessarily align with the person's actual background, especially if it's generating content based on a broad set of inputs.</p><p>4. Lack of Personal Touch: Personal nuances, humor, or any unique writing style that most humans have might be absent in AI-generated content.</p><p>5. Repetition: AI sometimes has a tendency to be repetitive or overuse certain phrases.</p><p>6. Too Structured: While structure is good, if every sentence seems to follow an almost formulaic pattern, it could be a hint.</p><p>7. Check References: If the cover letter mentions specific details, cross-checking them with the resume or online profiles might show inconsistencies.</p><p>8. Use Detection Tools: There are online tools and software solutions designed to detect AI-generated content. However, their efficacy can vary.</p><p>9. Ask Direct Questions: If you're hiring and suspect a cover letter might be AI-generated, you can always ask the candidate specific questions about its content during an interview.</p><p>10. Gut Feeling: Sometimes, it's just a feeling that the content doesn't "sound human". Trust your instincts, but always give the benefit of the doubt and follow up with other methods.</p><p>Remember, the use of AI tools isn't inherently negative. Some people might use AI to help draft or polish their cover letters. What's important is the authenticity of the experiences and skills presented and the genuine fit for the role.

However, if you live in a cold climate with snow, it's a great activity for both children and adults!" like what? why do you need a POV contrast here? but it will always do this.</p><p>- there's next to 0 sentence length variation.</p><p>- no idiosyncratic tendencies, eg using "like" a lot. Few people write like this, we write like we talk (as you can see I picked this example because I'm, like, guilty of it myself)</p><p>- no personal anecdotes at all. people like to talk about ourselves. the fact that an AI-generated response will <i>never</i> do this is very weird. (though I guess it would if you said "write a cover letter about myself")</p><p>I'm sure there's a shitton of clues that I pick up on subconsciously but yeah AI content is pretty obviously AI content.

                    <b>Abstract</b>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Large, high-capacity models trained on diverse datasets have shown remarkable successes on
                    efficiently tackling downstream applications. In domains from NLP to Computer Vision, this has led
                    to a consolidation of pretrained models, with general pretrained backbones serving as a starting
                    point for many applications. Can such a consolidation happen in robotics? Conventionally, robotic
                    learning methods train a separate model for every application, every robot, and even every
                    environment. Can we instead train “generalist” X-robot policy that can be adapted efficiently to new
                    robots, tasks, and environments? In this paper, we provide datasets in standardized data formats and
                    models to make it possible to explore this possibility in the context of robotic manipulation,
                    alongside experimental results that provide an example of effective X-robot policies. We assemble a
                    dataset from 22 different robots collected through a collaboration between 21 institutions,
                    demonstrating 527 skills (160266 tasks). We show that a high-capacity model trained on this data,
                    which we call RT-X, exhibits positive transfer and improves the capabilities of multiple robots by
                    leveraging experience from other platforms.

                <p><img src="https://robotics-transformer-x.github.io/img/overview.png"></p><p>We introduce the Open X-Embodiment Dataset, the largest open-source real robot dataset to date.
                    It contains 1M+ real robot trajectories spanning 22 robot embodiments,
                    from single robot arms to bi-manual robots and quadrupeds. </p>

                <p><img src="https://robotics-transformer-x.github.io/img/data_analysis.png"></p><p>The dataset was constructed by pooling 60 existing robot datasets from 34 robotic research labs
                    around the world. Our analysis shows that the number of visually distinct scenes is
                    well-distributed across different robot embodiments and that the dataset includes a wide range

                    <b>Model Overview</b>
                </h3>
                <p><img src="https://robotics-transformer-x.github.io/img/algorithm.png"></p><p>We train two models on the robotics data mixture: (1) RT-1, an efficient Transformer-based
                    architecture designed for robotic control, and (2) RT-2, a large vision-language model co-fine-tuned
                    to output robot actions as natural language tokens.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Both models output robot actions represented with respect to the robot gripper frame. The robot
                    action is a 7-dimensional vector consisting of x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw, and gripper opening or the
                    rates of these quantities. For data sets where some of these dimensions are not exercised by the
                    robot, during training, we set the value of the corresponding dimensions to zero.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We refer to the RT-1 model trained using the robotic data mixture as <span>RT-1-X</span>,
                    and the RT-2 model
                    trained using the robotic data mixture as <span>RT-2-X</span>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>To my great surprise, young people now somewhat frequently contact me in order to solicit <em>career advice</em>.
They are usually in college or highschool, and want to know what the best next steps are for a career in 
security or software development.</p>

<p>This is, honestly, a really complicated question, mostly because I’m usually concerned that the question
itself might be the wrong one to be asking. What I want to say, more often than not, is something along
the lines of <em>don’t do it</em>; when I got out of highschool and focused on the answer to that same 
question, it was very nearly one of the biggest mistakes of my life.</p>

<p>Since I get these inquiries fairly regularly, I thought I’d write something here that I can use as a sort 
of canonical starting point for a response.</p>



<h3 id="tyler-durden-was-wrong-you-are-your-job">Tyler Durden was wrong, you <em>are</em> your job.</h3>

<p>In 1971, Dr. Philip Zimbardo conducted a psychological experiment that is now popularly known as
the “Stanford Prison Experiment.”  He constructed a makeshift simulated prison in the basement of
Stanford University’s psychology department, took a group of volunteers who tested as psychologically 
“normal” with no criminal background, flipped a coin, and assigned half of them to be “prisoners”
and half of them to be “prison guards.”</p>

<p><img src="https://moxie.org/blog/images/stanford-prison-experiment-bars.jpg"></p>

<p>Initially, everyone acted awkwardly; the situation was so obviously foreign to their sense of self and 
their lived experience that they found it strange and even humorous.  Fairly quickly, however, the situation
eclipsed all of that.  The prisoners became divorced from their former identities, and began to act from the 
place of being a prisoner.  They alternated between staging minor protests and ratting each other out, to 
going on hunger strike and suffering psychological breakdowns.</p>

<p>The prison guards also <em>became</em> prison guards, even though they were allowed to return to their normal
lives in between their eight hour shifts. They went so far as to invent forms of psychological punishment, 
create solitary confinement cells, pit prisoners against each other in order to break them, and give long 
speeches while slowly pacing the hallway and rattling their wooden batons across the bars of the cell doors.</p>

<p>Had the coin landed differently, the individual people would have been on the reverse sides of the cell
doors, but the roles would have been the same.</p>

<iframe width="480" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GlIyD15KS6s?start=225" frameborder="0">
</iframe>

<p>Things got so out of control that the experiment, originally scheduled for two weeks, had to be ended after 
six days.</p>

<p>The experiment was positioned as a comment on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Ghraib_torture_and_prisoner_abuse">institutions</a>, but the simpler lesson 
I draw from it as an individual is just <em>be careful what job you take, because your job will change you</em>.</p>

<p>This is obviously true for these types of hyperbolic examples — it’s not hard to imagine that a customs
agent (who spends 40 hours a week looking suspiciously at people, thinking skeptically about the honesty
of what people say, scientifically observing people’s eye movement, and trying to trip people up with 
confusing questions) might approach a conversation with someone they’ve just met at a party differently 
than they would have before taking the job.</p>

<p>It’s equally easy to imagine that someone who has worked as a prison guard for a decade might approach a 
romantic relationship differently than someone who has worked as a grief counselor for the same period.</p>

<p>But it’s not just cops, prison guards, and customs agents.  The context of one’s life defines not just <em>what</em>
but <em>how</em> one thinks, and a job tends to dominate the context of one’s life — particularly when that job
is considered to be part of a career. Your job will change you.</p>

<h3 id="the-choices-we-make">The choices we make.</h3>

<p>I recently got around to reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Cometbus">Aaron Cometbus’</a>
enjoyable “Cometbus #54, In China With Green Day?!!”  One of my favorite quotes was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some things are like that—they strike you as repugnant for instinctive
reasons, probably having to do with your culture and the way you were
raised. The French word “gauche” comes to mind, but I preferred the
Hebrew word “treyf.” Literally, it means not kosher, but I also use it
to describe things like cars, bars, strip clubs, guns, dogs, rock-n-roll,
and football games. Things that are treyf, you avoid, not because you
hate them per se, but because in avoiding them you keep yourself from
becoming like the people you hate.</p>

  <p>– <cite>Aaron Cometbus, “Cometbus #54”</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The concept resonates with me for the same reasons.  Like Aaron, I have my own list of things that 
are <em>treyf</em>, not because I find them necessarily unenjoyable, but because they <em>add up</em> to something
that I ultimately dislike.</p>

<p>For instance, whenever I get on an airplane and walk past first class, I inevitably go through a familiar 
mental process.  First, I’m envious.  The passengers are already in their comfortable seats, drinking from 
champagne flutes, contemplating the moment after takeoff when they can recline into their cocoons and watch 
a movie of their choice on demand.</p>

<p>But then, I register who is sitting in those seats.  It’s usually almost all predominantly unhealthy looking 
middle-aged white men, who it is clear from a glance have spent literally hundreds of hours of their lives 
over the past year in these airplanes.  And suddenly, I’m glad that I’m not sitting there.</p>

<p>Those seats are <em>treyf</em> for me, not because I don’t envy extra leg room, but because I don’t envy the people 
sitting in them.  There’s a reason the bulk of the first class passengers resemble each other, just as there’s 
a reason prison guards tend to act the same.  I know that by making choices designed to land me in the first 
class cabin, it would be difficult to avoid also inheriting the dreariness associated with its current occupants.</p>

<h3 id="the-future-is-looking-back-at-you">The future is looking back at you.</h3>

<p>In the context of a career, these concepts make it simple to look into the future. Jobs at software 
companies are typically advertised in terms of the difficult problems that need solving, the impact the project 
will have, the benefits the company provides, the playful color of the bean bag chairs. Likewise, jobs in other 
fields have their own set of metrics that they use to position themselves within their domains.</p>

<p>As a young person, though, I think the best thing you can do is to ignore all of that and simply 
<em>observe the older people working there</em>.</p>

<p>They are the future you. Do not think that you will be substantially different. Look carefully at how 
they spend their time at work and outside of work, because this is also almost certainly how your life will 
look. It sounds obvious, but it’s amazing how often young people imagine a different projection for themselves.</p>

<p>Look at the real people, and you’ll see the honest future for yourself.</p>

<h3 id="be-careful-not-to-discover-a-career-before-youve-discovered-yourself">Be careful not to discover a career before you’ve discovered yourself.</h3>

<p>This all presupposes we’re starting from a point where considering these questions is a real possibility. 
Sure, pure objectivity is impossible; after all, society itself <em>also</em> defines the context of our thoughts, 
and by now it’s way too late to effectively remove ourselves from <em>that</em>. So how can we evaluate what 
experiences we want for ourselves, when it is experiences themselves which transform our very desires?</p>

<p>At the moment when young people are considering their career strategy, they have typically made all of
their life choices completely within supporting structures.  Even having worked hard to get where they are, 
and even though things like class and race can mean that some have the cards stacked against them, it’s 
rare for young people to have substantially departed from supporting frameworks.  Highschools have “college 
counselors” (not “dropout counselors”), scholarships and financial aid packages lead in a single direction, 
and university overlaps with internships — which then culminates largely in a series of “career fairs.”<br>
There is a tremendous amount of support for these decisions, and very little support for making any deviating 
choices.</p>

<p>When we arrive at the ends of these funnels, it’s possible that the direction we’re facing is more a
reflection of those structures than it is a reflection of ourselves.  Self-determination in a moment like 
that can’t simply be about making a choice, it has to start with transforming the conditions that <em>constitute</em>
our choices.  It requires challenging the “self” in “self-determination” by stepping as far outside of those
supporting structures as possible, for as long as possible.</p>

<p>This is necessarily terrifying.  I think a lot about a quote from 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfredo_M._Bonanno">Alfredo Bonanno</a>, an anarchist and habitual bank robber, 
on the feeling of leaving prison:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The instant you get out of prison you have the sensation that you are leaving something dear to you.
Why? Because you know that you are leaving a part of your life inside, because you spent some of your
life there which, even if it was under terrible conditions, is still a part of you.  And even if you
lived it badly and suffered horribly, which is not always the case, it is always better than the nothing
that your life is reduced to the moment it disappears.</p>

  <p>– <cite>Alfredo Bonanno, “Locked Up”</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know that the most significant and meaningful periods of my life have all been moments that I could have 
never rationally chosen or even <em>known as possibilities</em> had I not been foolish or lucky enough to step into 
the nothingness that Alfredo Bonanno writes about.  I try to remind myself that if leaving prison is scary,
the same is likely true for any genuine process of discovery.</p>

<h3 id="theres-no-rush-to-get-started-early-on-a-never-ending-task">There’s no rush to get started early on a never-ending task.</h3>

<p>Everything before a career has defined beginnings and endings.  Elementary school, middle school, junior high,
highschool, university.  There’s always been a predefined end, and that contributes a lot to making the
indignities of those institutions bearable.  Once you start working full time, though, it’s just One Long 
Semester that you’re expected to attend for <em>the rest of your life</em>.</p>

<p>So consider caution if you’re overly excited to start down that road as quickly as you can.  Other than being 
forever, it’s not as different from what’s come before as you might imagine.</p>

<h3 id="by-way-of-an-explanation">By way of an explanation.</h3>

<p>This is all just to explain why, when people write me for career advice, I’m as likely to respond 
with something like <em>“if I were you, I’d hitchhike to Alaska this summer instead.”</em></p>

<p>My career advice usually falls within the framework of doing the absolute minimum amount of work necessary

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://darnell.day/bbc-gives-up-on-threads-by-instagram-sticks-with-mastodon">https://darnell.day/bbc-gives-up-on-threads-by-instagram-sticks-with-mastodon</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37759871">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/LxUHCO5k.jpeg" alt="BBC News icon"></p>

<p>So numerous brands are giving up on <a href="https://threads.net/">Threads</a> by <a href="https://instagram.com/">Instagram</a>, allegedly due to lack of engagement (ironically, most of them are still using <a href="https://x.com/">X</a>, formally known as <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>).</p>

<p>What makes this news more interesting is the fact that the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/">British Broadcasting Corporation</a> (BBC) has abandoned its Threads account but is still maintaining its self-hosted Mastodon accounts online.</p>

<blockquote><p>The <a href="https://www.threads.net/@nfl">National Football League</a> hasn't posted anything in six weeks, before the start of the regular season. This is the nation's most popular sports league, and it has completely abandoned Meta's new platform. Even with its 1.9 million followers.</p>

<p>Among news publishers, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) <a href="https://www.threads.net/@bbc">stopped posting</a>to Threads 11 weeks ago, not long after the launch. <a href="https://www.threads.net/@cbsnews">CBS News</a> hasn't posted in five weeks. (<a href="https://ktla.com/news/some-major-brands-are-giving-up-on-threads-as-engagement-craters/">KTLA5</a>)</p></blockquote>

<p>Earlier in the year (at the end of July), the BBC announced that they were <a href="https://www.bbc.com/rd/blog/2023-07-mastodon-distributed-decentralised-fediverse-activitypub">engaging in a six-month experiment</a> with <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, &amp; even self-hosted their content on their custom domain: <a href="https://social.bbc/">Social.bbc</a> (how cool is that!).</p>

<p>While accounts like <a href="https://darnell.day/@/BBC5Live@social.bbc">@<span>BBC5Live@social.bbc</span></a> &amp; <a href="https://darnell.day/@/BBCRadio4@social.bbc">@<span>BBCRadio4@social.bbc</span></a> remain relatively active, <a href="https://darnell.day/@/bbc@threads.net">@<span>bbc@threads.net</span></a> appears abandoned, despite boasting far higher engagement levels on <a href="https://meta.com/">Meta</a>’s Twitter rival (now called X).</p>

<p>But why would the BBC abandon Threads while maintaining a presence on Mastodon as well as other social media platforms‽ There are three possible theories:</p>
<ul><li><p>BBC might be weary of posting content to Threads after Meta <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/meta-facebook-instagram-news-block-canada-wildfire/">geo-banned Canadian news outlets</a> after Canadian legislators passed a “news tax” law (<strong>note:</strong> the law is silly, but I digress).</p></li>

<li><p>BBC prefers to control its social narrative, &amp; will redirect followers from Threads to their Mastodon accounts once Threads joins the Fediverse.</p></li>

<li><p>BBC thinks Threads is a waste of time &amp; resources as Threads lacks a public API to help automate posting news to their account.</p></li></ul>

<p>Could the BBC eventually shut down their Mastodon account by the time 2024 arrives‽ Sure. But I suspect that <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/twitter-seeing-record-user-engagement-the-data-tells-a-different-story/">with X dying</a>, Threads stagnating, &amp; Meta raging, the BBC might keep their Mastodon account active to avoid having their voice limited online.</p>

<p>We’ve all admired the elegance of Japan’s traditional styles of architecture. Their development required the kind of dedicated craftsmanship that takes generations to cultivate — but also, more practically speaking, no small amount of wood. By the 15th century, Japan already faced a shortage of seedlings, as well as land on which to properly cultivate the trees in the first place. Necessity being the mother of invention, this led to the creation of an ingenious solution: <em>daisugi</em>, the growing of additional trees, in effect, out of existing trees — creating, in other words, a kind of giant <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2020/01/the-art-philosophy-of-bonsai.html">bonsai</a>.</p>
<p>“Written as 台杉 and literally meaning <em>platform cedar</em>, the technique resulted in a tree that resembled an open palm with multiple trees growing out if it, perfectly vertical,” <a href="https://www.spoon-tamago.com/2020/10/20/daisugi-japanese-forestry-technique/">writes Spoon and Tamago’s Johnny Waldman</a>. “Done right, the technique can prevent deforestation and result in perfectly round and straight timber known as <em>taruki</em>, which are used in the roofs of Japanese teahouses.”</p>


<p>These teahouses are still prominent in Kyoto, a city still known for its traditional cultural heritage, and not coincidentally where&nbsp;<em>daisugi</em> first developed. “It’s said that it was Kyoto’s preeminent tea master, <a href="http://thekyotoproject.org/english/sen-no-rikyu-the-greatest-tea-master/">Sen-no-rikyu</a>, who demanded perfection in the Kitayama cedar during the 16th century,” <a href="https://mymodernmet.com/kitayama-cedar-daisugi/">writes My Modern Met’s Jessica Stewart</a>.</p>

<p>At the time “a form of very straight and stylized <a href="https://www.rethinktokyo.com/sukiya-zukuri-japanese-architecture"><em>sukiya-zukuri</em></a> architecture was high fashion, but there simply weren’t nearly enough raw materials to build these homes for every noble or samurai who wanted one,” says <a href="https://twitter.com/wrathofgnon/status/1250287741247426565">a thread by Twitter account Wrath of Gnon</a>, which includes these and other photos of <em>daisugi</em> in action. “Hence this clever solution of using bonsai techniques on trees.” Aesthetics aside — as far aside as they ever get in Japan, at any rate — “the lumber produced in this method is 140% as flexible as standard cedar and 200% as dense/strong,” making it “absolutely perfect for rafters and roof timber.” And not only is&nbsp;<em>daisugi</em>‘s product straight, slender, and typhoon-resistant, it’s&nbsp;marveled at around the world 600 years later. Of how many forestry techniques can we say the same?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>The first reviews of <a href="https://frame.work/products/laptop-diy-13-gen-amd">Framework Laptop 13 (AMD Ryzen 7040 Series)</a> are live, and the results are everything we hoped for when we kicked off the product. Reviewers called out the massive jump in graphics performance, increases in battery life, and improvements in multi-core workloads. The integrated graphics capabilities are especially astounding, putting a wide range of recent game titles within reach in a thin, light, portable system. Check out some of what reviewers have to say:</p>
<h3><strong>“It immediately jumps to my number one recommendation for software developers looking for a small and portable laptop. But, given how insanely good this laptop is, I’d also strongly recommend those looking for a laptop for school or home or office use, to really consider this one."</strong></h3>
<p>– <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwr14Q4C9gY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JustJosh</a></p>
<h3><strong>“It’s worth saying, as usual, that this is, first and foremost, a productivity machine, but with AMD on board, it’ll play just as hard as it works."</strong></h3>
<p>– <a href="https://www.engadget.com/framework-brings-amd-mainboards-to-its-13-inch-laptop-140050567.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel Cooper, Engadget</a></p>
<h3><strong>“All upgrades should be this easy. Taking the Intel board out and putting the AMD board in didn't take me very long at all, especially with Framework's instructions handy.”</strong></h3>
<p>– <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-7040-framework-laptop-mainboard-transfer-performance-test-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrew Freedman, Tom's Hardware</a></p>
<p>Soon, you’ll be able to see real customer feedback too, with the first Batch 1 shipments going out shortly. With recent increases in our factory capacity and logistics throughput, we’re working through the rest of the pre-order backlog as quickly as we can. We’re also continuing to work with AMD and other silicon providers on further firmware and driver updates to continue to optimize the product, especially as it comes to Linux support.</p>
<h2>EU warehouse for Framework Marketplace items</h2>
<p>We have one more exciting, long awaited announcement for you. This week, we activated a new warehouse in the Netherlands, enabling substantially faster and cheaper shipment of <a href="https://frame.work/marketplace">Framework Marketplace</a> items to customers in EU and UK. Note that new laptops will continue to ship from our Taiwan warehouse. This is a project we’ve been working on for some time, finding the right partner, building integrations with our systems, and getting inventory into place. With this, we reduced our shipping prices to €12 to countries we ship to in EU and £10 to UK.</p>
<p>Our philosophy is to charge as close as possible to our actual costs for picking, packing, and shipping out orders. In addition to being transparent, we believe this better aligns incentives. Rather than hiding shipping costs within our product pricing and setting artificial free shipping thresholds to try to get you to buy more, you can choose how and when to group items that you need into orders to maximize value. This also means that when we optimize our infrastructure like we did this week, we get to pass the savings directly on to you.</p>

I have been hearing that at least for the last 40 years, and the statistics are alarming. According to the <a href="https://turningthetide.watercommission.org/">Global Commission on the Economics of Water</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are seeing the consequences not of freak events, nor of population growth and economic development, but of having mismanaged water globally for decades. As the science and evidence show, we now face a systemic crisis that is both local and global.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds about right. We are not very good at this sort of large-scale management. Everyone just does their thing, oblivious to the big picture, until we have a crisis. Then experts point out the looming crisis which everyone at first ignores. Then we have meetings, summits, and a lot of hand-wringing but next to nothing gets done. Eventually we mostly technology our way out of the problem, but not after significant negative consequences, especially for the world’s poor. The water crisis seems to be following the same playbook.</p>
<p>Now experts are predicting that by 2030 world demand for fresh water will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/17/global-fresh-water-demand-outstrip-supply-by-2030">outstrip supply by 40%</a>. This shortage will affect everyone, including people in wealthy developed nations. So now it’s a real crisis. To be clear, I am not trying to minimize this problem at all. The Commission outlines a seven-point plan for properly and fairly managing the world’s fresh water supply, and it all sound very reasonable. It feels like we are in a phase of human history when we are collectively realizing that billions of people have a global effect on the entire planet, and we need to seriously start transitioning from a local focus on securing resources, to globally managing those limited resources.</p>
<p><span id="more-14155"></span>But I have to admit that my level of worry about the fresh water problem was always mitigated by the sense that we would technology our way out of this one, eventually. There is a lot of water in the world. Water itself is not a limited resource, only fresh water, and we know how to make fresh water out of salt water. It looks like a problem that can be solved by incremental advances in technology. I also admit I know this perspective is a bit naive. I know that <a href="https://www.unicef.org/wash/water-scarcity">4 billion people</a> already experience water scarcity in the world at least part of the time. This is largely a political problem – a problem of mismanagement and lack of resource equity. Technology can never completely compensate for political malpractice or malfeasance. We need to do both – advance the technology while pushing for proper management.</p>
<p>The primary technology we are talking about is desalination – removing salt from salt water to make fresh water. There are already many desalination plants around the world, but like with everything, it’s ultimately a matter of economics. How much does it cost to desalinate water? It’s also a matter of scale – how much fresh water can we make? (These issues all sound very similar to global warming and energy production.) A recent incremental advance may move us closer to economical fresh water on demand. MIT engineers and their collaborators have improved on the design of <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/desalination-system-could-produce-freshwater-cheaper-0927">passive solar powered water desalination</a>.</p>
<p>The basic technology uses sunlight to evaporate salt water, which will then condense into drinkable fresh water, leaving the salt behind. The problem with this technology is that the salt left behind quickly clogs the system, meaning it has to be cleaned out every few days. This makes the devices labor and cost intensive. What the researchers did was add a circulating current to the water and the salt which is left behind. This removes the salt from the system and keeping it from clogging up. However, the initial design desalinated water at a very low rate. So they tweaked the design into a multi-stage system of evaporation and condensing that removes the salt while maintaining a high water output.</p>
<p>The result is a portable passive system, entirely run by sunlight and physics. Here is how it works:</p>
<blockquote><p>The heart of the team’s new design is a single stage that resembles a thin box, topped with a dark material that efficiently absorbs the heat of the sun. Inside, the box is separated into a top and bottom section. Water can flow through the top half, where the ceiling is lined with an evaporator layer that uses the sun’s heat to warm up and evaporate any water in direct contact. The water vapor is then funneled to the bottom half of the box, where a condensing layer air-cools the vapor into salt-free, drinkable liquid. The researchers set the entire box at a tilt within a larger, empty vessel, then attached a tube from the top half of the box down through the bottom of the vessel, and floated the vessel in saltwater.</p>
<p>In this configuration, water can naturally push up through the tube and into the box, where the tilt of the box, combined with the thermal energy from the sun, induces the water to swirl as it flows through. The small eddies help to bring water in contact with the upper evaporating layer while keeping salt circulating, rather than settling and clogging.</p></blockquote>
<p>For a box a square meter in size it can produce 5 liters of drinkable water per hour. The system can also last for several years. Perhaps more importantly, the total price for the water is less than the average price for tap water in the US. The system should also be scalable.</p>
<p>Assuming the best case scenario, that this system works, is scalable, and can be economically mass-produced, it may go a long way to mitigate water insecurity. I doubt something like this will be a solution all by itself. We still need to globally manage our water properly. But at least technology offers us new tools.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications such as multi-round dialogue, where long interactions are expected, is urgently needed but poses two major challenges. Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a ``sink'' even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup.
