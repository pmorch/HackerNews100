            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases/tag/14.0.0">https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases/tag/14.0.0</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38424633">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-pjax="true" data-test-selector="body-content" data-view-component="true"><p>ripgrep 14 is a new major version release of ripgrep that has some new<br>
features, performance improvements and a lot of bug fixes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In case you haven't heard of it before, ripgrep is a line-oriented search<br>
tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern.<br>
By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip<br>
hidden files/directories and binary files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The headlining feature in this release is hyperlink support. In this release,<br>
they are an opt-in feature but may change to an opt-out feature in the future.<br>
To enable them, try passing <code>--hyperlink-format default</code>. If you use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="nofollow">VS Code</a>,<br>
then try passing <code>--hyperlink-format vscode</code>. Please <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/discussions/2611">report your experience<br>
with hyperlinks</a>, positive or negative.</p>
<p>Another headlining development in this release is that it contains a rewrite of<br>
its regex engine. You generally shouldn't notice any changes, except for some<br>
searches may get faster. You can read more about the <a href="https://blog.burntsushi.net/regex-internals/" rel="nofollow">regex engine rewrite on<br>
my blog</a>. Please <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/discussions/2652">report your performance improvements or<br>
regressions that you notice</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, ripgrep switched the library it uses for argument parsing. Users<br>
should not notice a difference in most cases (error messages have changed<br>
somewhat), but flag overrides should generally be more consistent. For example,<br>
things like <code>--no-ignore --ignore-vcs</code> work as one would expect (disables all<br>
filtering related to ignore rules except for rules found in version control<br>
systems such as <code>git</code>).</p>
<p><strong>BREAKING CHANGES</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rg -C1 -A2</code> used to be equivalent to <code>rg -A2</code>, but now it is equivalent to<br>
<code>rg -B1 -A2</code>. That is, <code>-A</code> and <code>-B</code> no longer completely override <code>-C</code>.<br>
Instead, they only partially override <code>-C</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Build process changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>ripgrep's shell completions and man page are now created by running ripgrep<br>
with a new <code>--generate</code> flag. For example, <code>rg --generate man</code> will write a<br>
man page in <code>roff</code> format on stdout. The release archives have not changed.</li>
<li>The optional build dependency on <code>asciidoc</code> or <code>asciidoctor</code> has been<br>
dropped. Previously, it was used to produce ripgrep's man page. ripgrep now<br>
owns this process itself by writing <code>roff</code> directly.</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><strong>HP kept emailing me special offers so I checked its website. One offer for a HP Envy 17 laptop at £399 was so good that I placed an order and received various emails confirming the order and payment. Parcelforce texted the delivery slot. No delivery. Parcelforce and HP’s tracking systems then claimed I had refused the parcel. I scheduled a redelivery for the next day. Parcelforce then rang me and the agent acknowledged a delivery had not been attempted and that the tracking information was false. It claimed HP had requested that the parcel be returned to sender.</strong></p><p><strong>HP denied this and promised, in two subsequent emails, to send a replacement. Nothing came. I called HP again and was again promised a replacement was on its way. An email confirmed this the next day. Then came another email informing me HP had recalled the item due to a pricing error, stating it was under no obligation to provide a product if a pricing error was </strong><em><strong>“</strong></em><strong>obvious and unmistakable and could have reasonably been recognised by you as a mispricing”</strong><em><strong>.</strong></em></p><p><strong>I accept a mistake has been made, but can’t see how the onus of deciding whether there is a genuine spot discount, or a mistake, should rest with the customer. And, two weeks later, I still haven’t been refunded.<br></strong><em><strong>MM, Plymouth</strong></em></p><p>If you hadn’t attached all the emails from HP and Parcelforce inventing and reinventing the story of your failed delivery, I’d have struggled to believe it. Let’s start with the legal nitty gritty. Once a contract has been formed between a retailer and a customer, either when an order has been confirmed or after it has been shipped, the retailer can’t cancel if it discovers a pricing error.</p><p>HP’s terms and conditions state that the contract is formed once the order confirmation is sent. The retailer can only back out of the deal if it can show that you deliberately took advantage of a mistake.</p><p>A £1,399 laptop advertised at £10 is a mistake any customer would recognise. A £1,399 laptop priced at £399 as a special offer is more plausible. In 2002 Kodak was forced to honour its contract with more than 2,000 customers after erroneously advertising a £329 camera at £100.</p><p>You assumed the deal was genuine when it was still being advertised the day after you spotted it. HP’s behaviour sent you on a week-long wild goose chase and unleashed chaos at the Parcelforce depot.</p><p>Royal Mail told me, apologetically, that HP requested the return of the laptop while it was out for delivery, a request so rare no relevant tracking update existed. So the driver scanned the “refused delivery” option.</p><p>HP ignored my questions about how many customers were affected and why it repeatedly gave you false information. It stated merely that all affected customers had been notified. It says: “We are taking steps to ensure we deliver the first-class experience customers can expect from HP at all times, including with regard to communications with specific customers.”</p><p>You were contacted after my intervention and a refund arrived along with a 20% voucher nearly three weeks after it was first promised.</p><p><em>Email <a href="mailto:your.problems@observer.co.uk" data-link-name="in body link | mailto:your.problems@observer.co.uk">your.problems@observer.co.uk</a>.

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">some people over at r/rust are curious how the rewrite is going?</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">In short: We're "mostly" done. Quantifying that isn't all that easy because there are separate measurements - do you use lines or bytes, do you use rust vs C++ or do you use the amount of C++ that was <em>removed</em>?</p>
<p dir="auto">Depending on how you count, we're at anywhere between 60% (c++ sloc removed) and 74% (rust sloc vs c++ sloc) done.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>And</em> a lot of that is scaffolding we've duplicated that can be removed once the last caller is gone, so you get a bit of a domino effect. E.g. we have already translated wgetopt, but kept the C++ version around until the last caller is translated, which is <em>simpler</em> than adding translation gunk to all the C++ callers.</p>
<p dir="auto">What is left to do?</p>
<p dir="auto">The last big component that remains to be translated is the reader with the input system. This is 3.5k for the reader plus 1.3k for the screen handling plus 1k line for input plus 700 lines for the pager. This is pretty tightly coupled.</p>
<p dir="auto">After that the rest is some stragglers and the de-C++ifying of the build system - removing cmake, getting cargo to do everything we want (cmake still substantially drives the build, and we need e.g. cargo to build and install the documentation and completion files. this isn't just compiling a bunch of rust, we have a lot of auxilliary stuff!)</p>
<p dir="auto">This isn't <em>really</em> the sort of thing drive-by contributions are good for, I'm afraid.</p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">Alright, that's the update, now for answering some questions correcting some misconceptions I've seen in what I assume is <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/183odpt/media_fishshell_has_finally_been_converted_into_a/" rel="nofollow">this reddit thread</a>:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>We will be removing <em>all</em> of the C++.</li>
<li>A windows port is not planned, and has never been planned. C++ is also perfectly well-supported on Windows, so rust doesn't really help here. The language has never been the problem with a windows port, the problem is that windows is not unix!</li>
<li>We won't be changing the name or the mascot. We probably won't add "written in rust" to the tag line (but we might mention it on <a href="https://fishshell.com/" rel="nofollow">https://fishshell.com/</a>)</li>
<li>We have no real idea what the performance of the finished port is going to be. Early results are encouraging, but it is entirely possible this will be ~20% slower in some cases. Even once the initial port is done, the project won't be. There's a loooot to do.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
        
          
        
        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>A month ago I published a blog article dicussing why I do not think that there is any statistical evidence of widespread cheating in Titled Tuesday tournaments. I did not say that cheating is non-existent, I simply showed that looking at the data, the claim that a significant percentage of players are consistently using engine evaluations is unfounded. Since then, a former World Champion published an hour long video, and accused Hikaru Nakamura of cheating. Chess.com increased their efforts to catch cheaters, and the chess community has been in an uproar.</p>

<p>The methodology I used in the last post closely aligned with the one reportedly used by the team of mathematicians of a former world champion, who sparked this debate. The internet, and I, were however not satisfied by this methodology. The most salient counter argument arising from the discussion was that this methodology would not catch “smart” cheaters who use the engine evaluations only in critical positions or once or twice per game.</p>

<p>Something that Fabiano said in his podcast peaked my interest. He claimed that first, cheating has only taken off after the “chess-hype” in November of 2020 where significant amounts of money were suddently to be gained from online chess. Second, he stated that while cheating has increased online, it has not increased offline. The statistical minds among you will immediately see that this is a perfect opportunity for a difference-in-difference analysis. We have four conditions, first and second time period, online and offline. We can compare the change in cheating between online and offline, and see if there is a significant difference.</p>

<p>This much more robust methodology does not relieve us from defining some measure of cheating. ELO is an amazing system, predicting the winning probability of a player based on their and their opponent’s past perfomance. If there are cheaters online, this would be reflected in the ELO expectations of a games result becoming less predictive of the true outcome of a game. A 2400 playing like a 2600 against a 2700 rated player would increase their winning changes from 15.09% to 35.99%. In contrast to my previous blog article, this methodology does not examine any individual player, it mereley investigates whether the statistical properties of the ELO system have changed and thereby proves whether cheating has increased or not. The amazing thing about this methodology is that <em>it does not matter how the cheaters cheat, as long as they do so in a way that changes their winning chances</em>.</p>

<p>There is, however, one problem. Let’s assume a 2400 has found a way to calibrate the amount of cheating to reliably play at a level of 2600. We would no longer find any statistical incrongruencies in the ELO system. Therefore, we need to match titled players to their official (offline) FIDE rating. We can then compare how the winning chances of these players have changed between the two time periods with a rating that is unpolluted by cheating on Online servers.</p>

<p>Before diving into the data and results, two aspects need highlighting. First, online and offline chess naturally differ in expected ways - more flagging, premoves, streaming distractions, etc. Second, the pre- and post-hype eras likely differ as new players joined, <a href="https://www.chess.com/news/view/fide-mathematician-proposes-changes-to-improve-rating-accuracy">ratings shifted</a>, and motivation varied. We intentionally disregard these predictable differences. We are solely interested in the difference between the changes in Elo accuracy over time, online versus offline. This is known as a difference-in-differences analysis.</p>

<p>To understand why, consider a famous minimum wage study. Economists David Card and Alan Krueger compared unemployment rates before and after New Jersey raised its minimum wage, versus Pennsylvania which did not. If unemployment rose in both states, it would reflect broader economic trends, not the wage change. And just comparing unemployment rates would not isolate the wage impact from other changing factors. By comparing the difference in the change in unemployment between states, they isolated the wage impact from broader economic factors.</p>

<p>Similarly, we compare how Elo accuracy has changed over time, online versus offline. This methodology isolates the potential impact of increased cheating online from other realities of online chess. We purely examine whether Elo became a weaker predictor online versus offline after the 2020 boom.</p>

<h2 id="data">Data</h2>

<h2 id="online-chess">Online Chess</h2>
<p>Titled Tuesday has been running since 2014. I downloaded 540.666 unique titled tuesday games and results from Chess.com. We are only interested in the usernames of white and black players, ELO of White and Black Players (we will replace these with FIDE ratings), the result of the game, and finally the date of the game.</p>

<h3 id="rating-data">Rating Data</h3>
<p>To match players with their FIDE rating, I downloaded a complete list of all titled players from the <a href="https://www.chess.com/news/view/published-data-api">chess.com API</a>. In total there are 11.820 titled players.</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Subsequently, I downloaded all the information about these players from their Chess.com profiles. Most players list their real name and their Federation on their profile. I used this information to match the players with their FIDE rating. Fide publishes the entire data-set of all rated players on their website. To match the two data-sets I aligned their names and used fuzzy searching to find the closest match in the Fide data-set. In total 6.872 had a <em>very</em> close match in the FIDE list, with their federation and title matching up.</p>

<p><img src="https://dorianquelle.github.io/blog/assets/images/MatchedPlayersByCountry.png"></p>

<p>There are dozens of articles online discussing whether and how Lichess and Chess.com ratings correspond to FIDE ratings. Please do not overinterpret the following gif. It is only supposed to show how strong the corelation between the two variables are and will not tell you what your FIDE rating would be.</p>

<p><img src="https://dorianquelle.github.io/blog/assets/images/chess_ratings_animation_paused.gif"></p>

<h2 id="offline-chess">Offline Chess</h2>
<p>To establish an offline baseline, I used the <a href="https://www.openingmaster.com/chess-databases/om-otb">Opening Master Database</a> containing roughly 10 million historical and contemporary games played. I filtered this database to only include matches from Blitz or Rapid tournaments. This resulted in a list of 232.881 offline games. It shows three regresssions of chess.com ratings with the Fide Blitz, Rapid and Classical ratings. In general, Chess.com ratings are always higher than their Fide counterparts and the rating difference decreases with a higher rating.</p>

<p><img src="https://dorianquelle.github.io/blog/assets/images/MatchedPlayersByRegion.png"></p>

<p>This map showcases all games played in the offline data-base. The scatter points in Europe and the US are roughly proportional to the number of games played in this location. If your city is missing - I’m sorry, it probably has multiple ways of spelling it and is therefore not being matched.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<h2 id="biggest-upsets">Biggest Upsets</h2>
<p>The top spots for the biggest upsets are all held by <span>███████████████</span> who entered a titled tuesday tournament with an astounding rating of 100. He defied the odds when he beat <span>█████████</span> (2600+) with the ELO system giving him an expected outcome of &lt;0.00002. Im redacting the name incase this is a data-entry error and not sandbagging.</p>

<p>This table shows the top players (ranked according to their performace) for all Titled Tuesday games. In parenthesis, I show the difference of the performance to the players average ELO. Magnus dominates the field. He’s the only player exceeding an overall peformance of 3200 elo. Hikaru, Artemiev, Nepomniachtchi, and So exceed 3100. Firouzja and Caruana just miss this eilte club with a performance of 3092 and 3091 respectively. 
<!-- The 13th highest performing player is David Howell, reaching a performnce of 3053. However he is the player with the highest average score per game out of all players, outperforming Magns and Hikaru even though he has 200 points lower performance. --></p>

<h2 id="elo-rating---calibration">Elo Rating - Calibration</h2>
<p>Ideally, ELO predictions should line up extremely closely with the empiricial results that we see. If we predict that a player has an expected score of 0.2 - averaged over a large number of games - the observed score should be exactly 0.2. But in reality, ELO suffers from significant biases. See for example, the  chess statisticians <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Sonas">Jeff Sonas’</a> <a href="https://www.fide.com/docs/presentations/Sonas%20Proposal%20-%20Repairing%20the%20FIDE%20Standard%20Elo%20Rating%20System.pdf">investigation</a> into the ELO system. Players with a low expected score consistently outperform their expected score, while players with a high expected score consistently underperform their expected score.</p>

<p><img src="https://dorianquelle.github.io/blog/assets/images/ExpectedResultComparison.png">---&gt;
</p>
<p>Note: I calculate the expected score always based on the winning probability of white - as the fomulae does not take into account the fact that white is more likely to win, the expected score is slightly overestimated.</p>

<p>We see the same error for Chess.com. Even with much higher activity, a more sophisticated rating system, Chess.com still suffers from the same biases. However, this is not a problem for our analysis. We are not interested in the absolute expected score, but rather the change in the expected score between the two time periods and conditions (online vs offline).</p>


<p>As cheaters will have a rating that is higher than their true rating, we need an external data-source for the ratings. As discussed in the introduction, we downloaded all available FIDE ratings, and matched them to the Chess.com ratings.</p>

<p><img src="https://dorianquelle.github.io/blog/assets/images/Online_ExpectedResultComparison.png"></p>

<p>The figure displays the calibration of the Chess.com ratings compared to different FIDE ratings. Unsuprisingly, best data-source are the Chess.com ratings with a mean absolute error of 0.35. In second place are the FIDE Blitz ratings with a mean absolute error of 0.38. The FIDE Standard and Rapid ratings are slighly worse with a mean absolute error of 0.39. The fact that the FIDE ratings are roughly comparable to the Chess.com ratings in terms of calibration is a great sign, as it means that we can use the Fide ratings to estimate the expected score of a game.</p>

<h2 id="anaylsis---error-over-time">Anaylsis - Error over time</h2>
<p>Before running any statistical tests, we’ll first have a look at the error over time.</p>

<p><img src="https://dorianquelle.github.io/blog/assets/images/ErrorOverTime.png"></p>

<p>The figure shows the error of four different conditions. First, the blue line represents the prediction error using the Chess.com ratings. Second, the green, red, and yellow lines represent the error over time using the official fide ratings for the online games. Lastly, the black line shows the error over time for the offline games. We see that the error of the Chess.com ratings is consistently lower than the error for online games with FIDE ratings. As Chess.com ratings are much more accurate due to a higher activity online, this is not surprising. However, we also see that the error for the offline games is lower than the error for the online games. Visually we do not see any difference between the pre-hype and the post hype period.</p>

<h2 id="anaylsis---difference-in-difference">Anaylsis - Difference in Difference</h2>
<p>To test whether there is a significant difference between the change in error between the online and offline games, we run a difference-in-difference regression. The dependent variable is the error of the prediction. The independent variables are the time period (pre-hype vs post-hype), the condition (online vs offline), and the interaction between the two. The interaction term is the difference-in-difference. If the difference-in-difference is significant, we can conclude that there is a significant difference between the change in error between the online and offline games.</p>

<p>The figure displays the results from all four regressions (Comparing the prediction error using chess.com, Blitz, Rapid, and Classical ratings). In no condition do we find any evidence of cheating. Quite the opposite, the error actually drops for the online condition, while it rises for the offline conditions.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In my previous blog, I laid out why I am convinced that the allegations of pervasive and consistent computer assisted cheating do not hold water. In this article, I analysed whether there is any indication that cheating increased after the Chess boom in 2020, by running a Difference in Difference analysis, comparing online games to offline games. I found no evidence of cheating. In fact, the error of the prediction actually dropped for the online games, while it increased for the offline games.</p>

<p>I am convinced that there is no evidence that cheating increased after the chess boom in 2020, compared to the offline baseline. I am also convinced that there is no evidence of pervasive and consistent computer assisted cheating in titled tuesday tournaments.</p>

<h2 id="appendix">Appendix</h2>

<h3 id="simulation">Simulation</h3>
<p>I simulated a tournament of 500 players playing 22 rounds (early and late titled tueday). The players have normally distributed elo-ratings. However, a variable amount of people are “cheating”. They still have an official Elo-Rating but play according to another Elo-Rating, and thereby change the probable outcome.</p>

<p>The right pane shows the average prediction error for a given Number of Cheaters and Cheater Elo combination. The left-most pane shows the percentage of times that a simple t-test detected a significant change in the prediction error for each tournament at a 5% (left) and a 1% (center) confidence level.</p>

<p><img src="https://dorianquelle.github.io/blog/assets/images/cheating_simulation.png"></p>

<p>We are already able to detect cheating with relative confidence when only 10/500 people are cheating. If 10% of people are cheating, we can detect it with almost 100% confidence, even if the cheaters are “only” playing at a level of 2600 Elo.</p>

<h3 id="glicko-vs-elo">Glicko vs Elo</h3>
<p>Nerd Alert: Chess.com actually uses the Glicko instead of the ELO rating system. Glicko takes into account how volatile your rating is, and how many games you have played. The formulae for the expected score of a game and elo are not the same. However, for active chess players, the expected score estimation in Glicko doesn’t differ significantly from Elo. This is because the rating deviation (RD), a measure of uncertainty in a player’s rating, tends to be low for players who compete frequently. With a low RD, the Glicko expected score formula, which adjusts for player reliability, is roughly equivalent to the ELO formula. Therefore, for the purpose of estimating expected scores, not rating changes, the difference between using Glicko and Elo is minimal for active players. Because I do not have access to the RD of the players, I will use the Elo formulae to estimate the expected score of a game.</p>

<span>Darling [</span><span>~</span><span>]$</span> <span>uname</span>
<span>Darwin</span>
</pre>

<div>
    
    <p>Darling is a translation layer that lets you run macOS software on Linux</p>
</div>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p><i></i> Fast</p>
        <p>Darling runs macOS software directly without using a hardware emulator.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><i></i> Free</p>
        <p>Like Linux, Darling is free and open-source software. <br> It is developed openly on GitHub and distributed under the GNU GPL license version 3.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><i></i> Compatible</p>
        <p>Darling implements a complete Darwin environment. Mach, dyld, launchd — everything you'd expect.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><i></i> Easy to use</p>
        <p>Darling does most of the setup for you. Sit back and enjoy using your favorite software.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><i></i> Native</p>
        <p>We aim to fully integrate apps running under Darling into the Linux desktop experience by making them look, feel and behave just like native Linux apps.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2></h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>That sounds a lot like <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a> <i></i></p> 
        <p>And it is! Wine lets you run Windows software on Linux, and Darling does the same for macOS software. Another similar project is <a href="https://anbox.io/">Anbox</a>, for Android apps.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Does it support GUI apps?</p> 
        <p>Almost! This took us a lot of time and effort, but we finally have basic experimental support for running <i>simple</i> graphical applications.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Does it violate Apple's EULA?</p> 
        <p>No! We only directly use those parts of Darwin that are released as fully free software.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Does the name Darling mean anything?</p> 
        <p>The name Darling is a combination of “Darwin” and “Linux”. Darwin is the core operating system macOS and iOS are based on.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Can I run Darling on Windows using WSL?</p> 
        <p>With WSL 2, yes! See <a href="https://docs.darlinghq.org/wsl-build.html">the documentation</a> for more details.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Do you know about <a href="https://opensource.apple.com/">opensource.apple.com</a>, GNUstep, The Cocotron and other projects?</p>
        <p>We do, and in fact, Darling is largely based on the original Darwin source code published by Apple. We use The Cocotron as a basis for our Cocoa implementation, along with the <a href="https://github.com/apportable/Foundation">Apportable Foundation</a> and various bits of GNUstep.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Do you have plans for supporting iOS apps?</p> 
        <p>Yes, in the long run, we'd like to be able to run iOS apps on ARM devices (like most Android phones). A significant challenge here would be to write our own implementation of UIKit. Come talk to us if you're interested in working on this!</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>How do I contribute?</p> 
        <p>Start by reading the <a href="https://docs.darlinghq.org/">documentation</a> and <a href="http://blog.darlinghq.org/">our blog</a> to get familiar with Darling internals. Then, come and join us <a href="https://github.com/darlinghq/darling">on GitHub</a>. It's great if you have experience in developing for macOS or iOS, but it's absolutely not required to start contributing.</p>

The lesson any future founders should take is to kill off third party apps sooner rather than later if you ever want to do so, before user growth on those platforms becomes an issue.

The old design had a sidebar where subreddits kept a FAQ and wiki. Today, the same questions get asked again and again on many subreddits. Mods can't lock those posts and direct the author to the FAQ, because most users can't even see the FAQ. Mods who try to ensure a firm hand regularly get excoriated by the community, even by regulars on the sub, as "gatekeepers".

    <p>If you told Yamauchi Fusajiro that the little playing card business he had just started would one day sell video game consoles, he would have no idea what you were talking about. It <em>was</em> 1889, after all. But nevertheless, that’s exactly what happened, and today everyone knows the name Nintendo. But what you might not know? A particular pair of <em>Pong</em> clones from the spunky little Kyoto folks– their first consoles– are the worst <em>Pong</em> clones of the bunch. Why? And did they fix it?</p>

<h2 id="the-rapid-history">The rapid history</h2>

<p>When I say the Color TV Game series lacks as a video game console, we need to look at the competition is doing. Obviously the Color TV Game <strong>doesn’t even compare</strong> to the <a href="https://nicole.express/2022/fact-checking-a-bankrupt-company.html">Turbo Duo</a>, but outside of maybe a very lucky thrift store visit, no one is really going to be deciding between these two systems. Behold, a whirlwind tour of the history of <em>Pong</em> consoles.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/colory/feka.jpg" title="delicately balancing the Color TV Game 6 on your fingers, as you do" alt="Jonathan Brandstetter from the Johnny Turbo comic holds two compact disks. The image has been modified, and now Faketendo's pong DOESNT EVEN COMPARE to Gate of Thunder on the Turbo Duo"></p>

<p>Atari’s arcade <em>Pong</em> came out in 1972, secretly inspired by the Magnavox Odyssey which came out the same year. The Odyssey is a weird system though (very much unlike anything that followed it); it can indeed play something like <em>Pong</em>, but scoring is entirely manual. Magnavox partnered with Nintendo to create the Odyssey’s light gun, but partnered with Epoch (of <a href="https://nicole.express/2023/tv-luke-i-am-your-tv-vader.html">TV Vader</a> fame) to release a Pong-like system in that country in 1975, the Electrotennis. This is credited as the first domestic Japanese game, and also lacked on-screen scoring. I’ll admit I’m less familiar with the Japanese market, but reports say that Electrotennis wasn’t the first <em>Pong</em> console there, just the first <em>domestic</em> one.</p>

<p>At the end of 1975, Atari released <em>Home Pong</em> in North America, initially through Sears. This is usually credited as the first home <em>Pong</em> console to allow automatic scoring in-game by displaying numbers on the screen. This “digital” scoring was a killer app for its time. 1976 followed with General Instrument’s AY-3-8500 chip. This famous “Pong on a chip” (<em>Home Pong</em> was also a Pong on a chip, but Atari didn’t sell it to outside companies) was used in a whole host of systems. It had four built-in <em>Pong</em> variants and two light gun games, and of course digital scoring as well. The AY-3-8500 produced a huge flood of near-identical consoles sold all over the world.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/colory/woolco.jpg" title="the Woolco TV fun game" alt="Two hands playing monochrome Pong"></p>

<p><em>Home Pong</em> was color, but the AY-3-8500 was mostly used in monochrome games, even though it could be “colorized”. Essentially, the AY-3-8500 output different parts of its signal (the paddles, the playfield, etc) on different pins; a colorizer chip (like GI’s own AY-3-8515) could take those and integrate different colors, while a monochrome system would just tie the outputs together. And most AY-3-8500 systems were monochrome. Most also left off the light gun, like the <a href="https://archive.org/details/youtube-6i5kZV_KOCU">Woolco TV Fun Game</a> above, making them a four-game console.</p>



<p>So this is the state of Pong clones at the start of 1977. Almost all were monochrome (AY-3-8500 pioneer Coleco’s first color system, the Telstar Colormatic, wouldn’t arrive until Christmas that year). Magnavox did have the Odyssey 500, a color system that seems unfair to Magnavox to call a <em>Pong</em> clone– more on that in a later post. In any case, the Odyssey series wasn’t sold on the Japanese market, as far as I know, and Epoch wouldn’t follow up the Electrotennis with the color System 10 until later that year. The average <em>Pong</em> was an AY-3-8500 game:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Four games: Practice, Tennis, Hockey (sometimes called Soccer), and Squash (sometimes call Handball or Jai Alai)</li>
  <li><em>Maybe</em> two rarely-included shooting games with a lightgun</li>
  <li>Almost certainly no colors</li>
</ul>



<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/colory/ninty.png" title="this logo was out of date by 1977, but they've used the same wordmarks for so long" alt="Nintendo Playing Card Company logo"></p>

<p>And now, our protagonist. Nintendo Co. Ltd., is a company that needs no introduction. Japan’s largest playing card company, it had begun an aggressive diversification, entering a number of markets, mostly with limited success. But by the 1970s it had seen some success in the toy market and in the electromechanical arcade game market, and seemed ripe to enter the electronic games field.</p>

<p>That brings us to 1977. Nintendo has entered the video game market. What have they done.</p>



<p>Nintendo released two consoles in June of 1977: the Color TV Game 6 and the Color TV Game 15, differing in the number of games, whether the controllers are on strings, and of course price: according to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VmwNej8noQ">this commercial</a>, ¥9,800 for the 6 and ¥15,000 for the 15. That’s a pretty good price! Electrotennis was ¥19,000 two years earlier, and lacked scoring, color, or multiple games.</p>



<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/colory/dual.jpg" title="if the ad looks like this on your tv, mitsubishi wants to talk to you" alt="A blurry old commercial showing the two systems"></p>

<p>This seems to have mostly been a marketing segmentation move by Nintendo; the two systems have very similar internal hardware and the same chip, with the additional games just being not accessible by the provided controls. So I have the Color TV Game 15, and even though it came out a week later, it’s equivalent enough.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/colory/ctg15.JPEG" title="now i'm playing with power" alt="A Color TV Game 15, in brilliant yellow, with wired removable controls and complex switches"></p>

<p>The Color TV Game 15 gets its name from fifteen games. Now, the game selector switch only has eight options; the name counts the singles and doubles variants as separate games. This actually seems fair in context; the AY-3-8500 only offered doubles in Hockey, and no option per game. (The last of the eight options, Shooting Game, is an exception, and we’ll get to it) And yes, it’s in full, glorious color, with on-screen scoring.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/colory/gemu.jpg" title="wow you can almost see the game underneath all that video interference" alt="Color TV Game 15 gameplay"></p>

<p>The internals come from a partnership with Mitsubishi. The main chip is a Mitsubishi M58815P, and the smaller Mitsubishi M51342P is just an RF modulator chip. People have done <a href="https://forums.nesdev.org/viewtopic.php?t=24441">video mods</a>, but I’m just using RF over my not-particularly-great RF2AV box.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/colory/circuit.JPEG" title="the controller hardwired to plugs reminds me of the Famicom" alt="Color TV Game circuitboard. It's quite small"></p>

<p>As far as I know, the Mitsubishi M58815P was exclusive to Nintendo; however, it does have a <a href="https://slydc.blogspot.com/2016/03/">PAL cousin</a>, the M58813, which appeared in non-Nintendo systems. Nintendo never sold any of the Color TV Game consoles outside Japan, but the same exact chip powers both the Color TV Game 6 and Color TV Game 15. Which console has which games?</p>

<p>For my money, the best game is probably Hockey Doubles. A or B; A adds some obstacles in the middle of the screen. Hockey Doubles, much like Hockey on the AY-3-8500, gives both sides two paddles, but interleaves them, so it’s almost like foosball.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/colory/hock.jpg" title="hockey" alt="Hockey with pink paddles"></p>

<p>Note that an odd shortcoming here of the Color TV Game: despite being color, no effort is made to distinguish the two paddles for each player. Of course, there’s no horizontal movement, so it’s never actually ambiguous whose side is which. Still, if you have color, why not use it?</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/colory/volley.jpg" title="volleyball" alt="Volleyball on a purple field"></p>

<p>Tennis A, Volleyball A, and Volleyball B are all basically just “<em>Pong</em> with stuff in the middle”, which behaves slightly different based off of game mode. Tennis B is your classic <em>Pong</em>-a-like. Doubles for all of these give each player two paddles on their respective side. There’s no equivalent to the AY-3-8500 Squash or Practice modes.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/colory/ping.jpg" title="ping pong" alt="Ping Pong, purple paddles, green text, and a short white"></p>

<p><em>Ping Pong</em> is probably the most unique pong-a-like on this console, but more unique from a conceptual standing than an actual fun game mode. Essentially you have a side view, but your paddles move as usual; you can, however, get the ball to arc over the net. It’s a bit confusing perspective-wise, really, but I’ve not seen any other Pong game like it.</p>

<p>And then there’s Shooting Game. No really, this is a shooting game.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/colory/shooting.jpg" title="bang bang" alt="Shooting game, on a cyan background"></p>

<p>It’s pretty surprising to me that this isn’t a lightgun game; Nintendo, after all, were probably one of the best in the world at home lightgun games, and had made the lightgun for the original Magnavox Odyssey. But I’m not sure if Nintendo actually had very much involvement in the chip; it seems like they were mostly acting the same way as General Instrument’s customers did, taking an existing chip and putting their own box on it.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/colory/shooting2.jpg" title="cyan bullet" alt="Shooting game, firing a bullet"></p>

<p>The shooting game works as follows: the right paddle blinks on and off. The left player positions their paddle, and then presses the red button on the console. They must hit the second player’s paddle while it’s solid to score a point. The left number is the number of points scored, the right the number of attempts made– note, however, that if you switch modes mid-game, your score holds over, even though it means something different here.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/colory/shooting2.jpg" title="cyan bullet" alt="Shooting game, firing a bullet"></p>



<p>The Color TV Game 15 gets its odd number by counting the singles and doubles variants of the Pong-like games separately, and then adds the shooting game. But there <em>is</em> a shooting game doubles mode! It feels almost like it shouldn’t be accessible, though.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/colory/shooting3.jpg" title="rated m for extreme violence" alt="Shooting game, two paddles on each side, with a score showing"></p>

<p>You have two paddles on each side. Only the farthest to the right paddle blinks, though, and the bullet is fired from player 1’s leftmost paddle. It passes through player 1’s second paddle (which therefore does nothing in this game mode) and hitting either the flashing paddle or the always-opaque paddle gives player 1 a point, so it’s basically easy mode. I can see why they didn’t count this as its own game.</p>

<h2 id="but-why-is-it-bad">But why is it bad?</h2>

<p>So everything I described is basically a pretty normal, competent, Pong clone of its time. Digital on-screen scoring, color graphics, paddles on a cable, and a large number of games make it stand out; sure, its games are arguably not as varied as the AY-3-8500 games, but there’s more of them; and yes, the shooting game is just weird. Still, a pretty solid console at a good price. So what’s the catch?</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/spinny/pot-symbol.png" title="this is the symbol for pot. not to be confused with a leaf." alt="An electrical symbol showing an arrow pointing to a point on a rough line"></p>

<p>The catch is those paddles. So, in the 1970s, controls for <em>Pong</em> games was pretty simple: you used a potentiometer. <em>Pong</em> did it. The Odyssey did it before them. All the AY-3-8500 games did it. Even the Apple ][ came with potentiometer-based paddles in 1977. I talk about this a bit in the <a href="https://nicole.express/2023/megumi-rescue-thyself.html"><em>Megumi Rescue</em></a> post; the potentiometer has some clear characterstics that make it great in this role:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A potentiometer has a maximum and minimum value. They can’t spin indefinitely by the very nature of how they’re constructed, and each position of the pot maps to a point on screen.</li>
  <li>You can move a potentiometer at varied speeds, and your character will move at varied speeds. This is an analog controller, not a digital left and right one. This is exactly what makes it so good for <em>Pong</em>-style games.</li>
</ol>

<p>I’d go a step further and say the potentiometer is what makes a simple <em>Pong</em> game fun. It’s a basic electrical component that, when it becomes a game control, gives you near-perfect control over your paddle’s position. So let’s crack open the Color TV Game 15’s controller.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/colory/skept.JPEG" title="fauxtentiometer" alt="What looks like a potentiometer underneath the Color TV Game 15's dial"></p>

<p>Sure, the controllers <em>look</em> like they have potentiometers. But any big fan of potentiometer control should be shocked when they hit reset on the Color TV Game 15:</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/colory/reset.jpg" title="the small paddle is another option, but it wasn't used to beef up the numbers" alt="0-0, both paddles in the center"></p>

<p>The paddles snap back to the center. Remember, a potentiometer reads a physical value in the physical world– it <em>can’t</em> “snap back”, unless you hook it up to a motor to spin it into place, which Nintendo and Mitsubishi obviously didn’t do. (Though that would’ve been cool) So this isn’t a potentiometer.</p>

<p>Now, this would be fine if, like <em>Megumi Rescue</em>, they had used a quadrature encoder, also known as a “spinner”. Those definitely existed in 1977; the contemporary <a href="https://nicole.express/2023/have-you-read-atari-today.html">Atari 2600</a> game <em>Indy 500</em> made use of them to provide analog potentiometer-like control accuracy with infinite spin. But Nintendo-Mitsubishi didn’t do that either.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/colory/mitsumi.JPEG" title="at least the mitsumi logo is cool" alt="A small switch with three wires"></p>

<p>The Mitsumi switch inside this controller is just that: a three-position switch. You can spin it indefinitely, but it’s sending a digital signal on its wires; connecting one side or the other, or neither if it’s not actively being moved. It also feels terrible and mushy, but that might be because it’s old, so I’ll give it a pass there.</p>

<p>What I won’t give it a pass on is, the paddle <em>speed</em> is not controllable by the user, and the position can not change as fast as a potentiometer. You lose that fine control the potentiometer gives you. And that’s what makes the Color TV Game 6 &amp; 15 the worst <em>Pong</em> clones. They broke the formula. It’s like playing <em>Arkanoid</em> with the NES controller, but at least <em>Arkanoid</em> has other features to distract you; this just has <em>Pong</em> with stuff in the middle.</p>

<p><video src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/colory/slow.mp4" width="75%" autoplay="" loop="" muted=""> You don't have a video tag support or something? So you can't see this footage of *Color TV Game 15*? Ah too bad.</video></p>

<p>See that video? That’s how fast the paddle can move. It’s not slow, but it’s slower than you can with a potentiometer.</p>

<h2 id="well">Well…</h2>

<p>The Nintendo Famicom at launch had square squishy buttons on the controller, and an unknown problem with the chipset. Nintendo recalled these early models; unless you seek them out, you’ll only see ones with hard round buttons. As far as I know, Nintendo didn’t recall the Color TV Game, but they <em>did</em> fix the problem. Let’s look at the bottom of my Color TV Game 15.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/colory/ctg-15s.JPEG" title="That is the Nintendo logo at the bottom of the sticker, to all those who claim the Color TV Game 6/15 aren't Nintendo-branded" alt="Nintendo Color TV Game 15 label, showing model CTG-15S"></p>

<p>Pretty much every Nintendo game console ever released has had a three letter identifier code. The Switch, <code>HAC</code>, likely for “Handheld And Console”. The GameCube, <code>DOL</code> for its codename Dolphin. The Famicom was <code>HVC</code>, for Home Video Computer, while the NES had just, well, <code>NES</code>. And it all started here: <code>CTG</code>, Color TV Game.</p>

<p>But that’s not important. What’s important is the part <em>after</em> the CTG, the 15S. The launch models of the Color TV Game were the CTG-6S and CTG-15S; but the fact that I said launch models implies there was a follow-up. And there was; the CTG-15V, which changed the color to an orange red. Did they fix anything else? Well, I don’t have a CTG-15V. But I <em>do</em> have a CTG-6V.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/colory/ctg6.JPEG" title="the color tv game 6: inferior, but very pretty" alt="A Color TV Game 6, in brilliant yellow, with built-in controls"></p>

<p>The CTG-6V switches the color from the almost beige light orange of the CTG-6S to the more vibrant color from the 16S. It also adds an external power supply option, which the CTG-15S had (a Famicom power supply works, but <strong>not an NES</strong> one) but the the CTG-6S lacked. And even before you turn it on, you can tell by feel, it’s a potentiometer-based system now. The paddles have stops.</p>

<p>Let’s crack it open and take a look. The Color TV Game 6 and 15 are held together with standard cross-head screws, though I’m not sure if they’re Japanese-standard or Philips (a subtle difference); no Gamebits here. Be careful though; on the CTG-6, there’s some screws underneath the battery cover, which isn’t the case on the CTG-15.</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/colory/6side.JPEG" title="the pot has two wires, while the inferior switch has three, because analog is magic" alt="Inside the Color TV Game 6"></p>

<p>That’s definitely a potentiometer. And that Mitsubishi M58816P chip is an updated model that can take advantage of it. That 7714 looks like a timecode that would imply the 14th week of 1977; that would’ve been before the June launch of the Color TV Game and imply that this fix would’ve been in the works from day 1; but the older chip has a 751R number, so I’m not sure it’s actually that.</p>

<p>And with a potentiometer, the paddle can move <em>fast</em>. It looks practically like a glitch here as I quickly move from top to bottom. (That video quality is really awful; maybe I should look into a proper video mod after all)</p>

<p><video src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/colory/fast.mp4" width="75%" autoplay="" loop="" muted=""> You don't have a video tag support or something? So you can't see this footage of *Color TV Game 6*? Ah too bad.</video></p>

<p>In theory, it should be possible to wire in additional switches to this chip and allow access to the games that are missing on the Color TV Game 6; I might do that eventually just to get the shooting game; I’m curious if it also allows the weird doubles mode, or if Mitsubishi blocked that.</p>



<p>It’s an interesting thing to look at from 2023, though. The V-series are definitely the better <em>Pong</em> clones; but, uh, are you looking for a <em>Pong</em> clone in 2023? Or are you looking for a unique bit of Nintendo history? As the only company to have made <em>Pong</em> clones and to still be making consoles, they’re clearly doing something right, even if their first console did something wrong.</p>

<h2 id="and-finally-a-psa">And finally, a PSA</h2>

<p>Let’s take one last look at my Color TV Game 15. Do you see this mark across the top?</p>

<p><img src="https://nicole.express/assets/img/colory/burn.JPEG" title="the pot has two wires, while the inferior switch has three, because analog is magic" alt="A horizontal line above the Color TV Game 15 logo, etched into the plastic"></p>

<p>Consoles with built-in RF cables, like the Color TV Game 6, often have scars like this, and it seems particularly common on the Nintendo consoles. This is because the RF cable contains plasticizers to make it more flexible; the problem is, people often wrap cables around the console for convenient storage. This is fine for the short term, but if they’ve been in the closet for almost fifty years, well, you get burns like this or even worse. Be careful how you store these!</p>

<p>Infants and toddlers may be psychologically wired to thrive with high levels of "sensitive care" and personal attention, according to a study conducted with contemporary hunter-gatherer societies.

										  
											        </p>
										 
										 											  
<p>Research led by an evolutionary anthropologist at Cambridge University found that hunter-gatherer infants receive attentive care and <a href="https://phys.org/tags/physical+contact/" rel="tag">physical contact</a> for about nine hours per day from up to 15 different caregivers.
</p><p>Dr. Nikhil Chaudhary says that, for the vast majority of our species' evolutionary history, mothers probably had far more support than they currently do in Western countries such as the UK.
</p><p>He argues that recent changes in UK policy show childcare is becoming more of a priority for the government, which is a step forward, but more needs to be done to ensure the well-being of mothers and <a href="https://phys.org/tags/children/" rel="tag">children</a>.
</p><p>"For more than 95% of our <a href="https://phys.org/tags/evolutionary+history/" rel="tag">evolutionary history</a> we lived as <a href="https://phys.org/tags/hunter-gatherers/" rel="tag">hunter-gatherers</a>. Therefore, contemporary hunter-gatherer societies can offer clues as to whether there are certain child-rearing systems to which infants, and their mothers, may be psychologically adapted," said Chaudhary.
</p><p>However, caution should be exercised before jumping to conclusions, argues Chaudhary., "Many aspects of our psychology have evolved to be flexible rather than best suited to one specific way of life . The extent to which this is true for childrearing is still debated."
</p><p>For the latest research, Dr. Chaudhary and his colleague Dr. Salali worked with Mbendjele BaYaka hunter-gatherers who reside in the Republic of Congo, and have been analyzing and interpreting the findings alongside a child psychiatrist, Dr. Annie Swanepoel.
</p><p>In the new paper, published in <i>Developmental Psychology</i>, the researchers say that children may be "evolutionarily primed" to expect exceptionally high levels of physical contact and care, as well as personal attention from several caregivers in addition to their <a href="https://phys.org/tags/biological+parents/" rel="tag">biological parents</a>.
</p><p>When considering the implications for Western countries, the authors highlight that the provision of affordable high-quality childcare support, which goes beyond effective supervision, should be prioritized. Higher <a href="https://phys.org/tags/caregiver/" rel="tag">caregiver</a>-to-child ratios, and stability of key caregivers in nurseries and institutional care, may be important for minimizing risks to well-being.


											  													    </p>
											  
											  <p>In the observed hunter-gatherer communities, caregiving goes so far beyond the parents, according to the researchers. Children often have 10+ caregivers and occasionally 20 or more, and typically a mother's support system would help respond to more than half of her baby's episodes of crying, which can be one of the most challenging aspects of parenting.
</p><p>"Support for mothers also has numerous benefits for children such as reducing the risk of neglect and abuse, buffering against family adversity, and improving maternal well-being which in turn enhances maternal care," said Dr. Swanepoel.
</p><p>The study found that it was common for <a href="https://phys.org/tags/older+children/" rel="tag">older children</a> and adolescents to be heavily involved in caring for infants, further supporting mothers and giving these young caregivers valuable experience. The researchers speculate that this might boost their confidence as caregivers, and perhaps offer some protection against the anxieties often experienced by first time parents.
</p><p>The authors also point out that in Western societies it is common for childcare to be used simply to allow parents to work, but insist that childcare needs to give parents an actual break. They argue that throughout human history and prehistory, parents have never been under the pressure they are now in terms of lack of support.
</p><p>"The nuclear family system in the west is a world away from the communal living arrangements of hunter-gatherer societies like the Mbendjele," said Chaudhary. He says that changes in UK childcare policy, such as expanding free childcare to include younger children, are an important step.
</p><p>However, both of these schemes are only available for working families and further contribute to childcare only being available for parents to fill the 'freed' time with work, rather than rest.
</p><p>Ratios of caregivers to children were greater than five-to-one in the observed hunter-gatherer groups, whereas in UK nurseries each adult is responsible for numerous children. In fact, regulations on adult-to-child ratios in early years settings have recently decreased for two-year-olds to one caregiver for five children—the opposite of what the researchers observed in the Mbendjele communities.
</p><p>Despite the high numbers of caregivers, the study suggests that children may be adapted to have a stable set of a core caregivers within this larger network. Mbendjele children benefit from the supplementary care of many people, but retain access to personal attention and consistency from a handful of key caregivers.
</p><p>This is in line with previous research suggesting a potential link between instability of caregivers and issues with emotional and cognitive development, says Chaudhary, who is concerned that many <a href="https://phys.org/tags/childcare/" rel="tag">childcare</a> and education settings in the UK currently face a staffing crisis, and rely on ever-changing agency staff.
</p><p>"Childcare is finally becoming a priority in the government's budget, but there is much more to do," Chaudhary added. "As a society, from policy makers to employers to health care services, we need to work together to ensure mothers and children receive the support and care they need to thrive."

</figure><p>Scientists have detected the most powerful cosmic ray seen in more than three decades. But the exact origin of this turbocharged particle from outer space remains a mystery, with some suggesting that it could have been generated by unknown physics.</p><p>The puzzling cosmic ray had an estimated energy of 240 exa-electronvolts (EeV; 10<sup>18</sup> electronvolts), making it comparable to the most powerful cosmic ray ever detected, aptly named the Oh-My-God particle, which measured at around 320 EeV when it was discovered in 1991. The findings were published today in <i>Science</i><sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>.</p><p>“It’s amazing because you have to think of what could produce such high energy,” says Clancy James, an astronomer at Curtin University in Perth, Australia.</p><p>A cosmic ray, despite its name, is actually a high-energy subatomic particle — often a proton — that zips through space at close to the speed of light. In their ultrahigh-energy form, cosmic rays have energy levels that exceed one EeV, which is around one million times greater than those reached by the most powerful human-made particle accelerators. Cosmic rays with energies of more than 100 EeV are rarely spotted — fewer than one of these particles arrives on each square kilometre of Earth each century.</p><h2>Not a mistake</h2><p>Toshihiro Fujii, an astronomer at the Osaka Metropolitan University in Japan, stumbled across some bizarre signals on 27 May 2021, while he was doing a routine data check at the Telescope Array, a cosmic-ray detector in Millard County, Utah. The signals suggested that the facilities’ detectors had been smashed with something super energetic, but he was sceptical at first. “I thought there was some sort of mistake or bug in the software,” says Fujii. “I was really surprised.” But measurements were consistent with those produced by ultra-cosmic rays. The scientists nicknamed the particle ‘Amaterasu’, after a Japanese Sun goddess.</p><p>But when Fujii and his team tried to pinpoint the source of the energetic spike, they drew a blank. Ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays usually travel through space relatively smoothly, because they don’t bounce off magnetic fields as strongly as low-energy cosmic rays do. This would have made it easy to pinpoint the stellar explosion, black hole or galaxy that it came from.</p><p>But Fujii and his team calculated the source of the ray to be in a void-like region where few galaxies reside. To cover all bases, the researchers also tried matching the cosmic ray with possible source galaxies and objects located just outside its arrival direction. But none of them seemed to fit. “There was nothing,” says Fujii.</p><p>One explanation could be that the models estimating how magnetic fields influence the course of cosmic rays are off and could require some tweaking, says James. If that’s the case, it’s possible that Amaterasu might have come from a slightly different direction than the team’s calculations suggest. “We think we’ve got good estimates, but maybe we’re wrong,” says James.</p><p>Another possibility is that ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays are produced by unknown physical processes that might enable them to travel much vaster distances than previously thought, says Jose Bellido Caceres, an astroparticle physicist at the University of Adelaide, Australia. “It could be new physics,” says Bellido Caceres, who has worked on the Pierre Auger Observatory in Malargüe, Argentina. He adds that cosmic rays offer a testing ground for exploring how particles interact at extreme energies that cannot be produced by accelerators on Earth.</p><p>Fujii and his team are in the process of upgrading the Telescope Array to be four times as sensitive as before. This will allow researchers to capture more of these rare ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays and trace their origins more precisely.</p>

for Guix is not all that hard but, as always, it’s much harder the first
time you do it, especially when starting from a blank page and/or not
being familiar with the programming environment of Guix.  <a href="https://guix-hpc.gitlabpages.inria.fr/guix-packager/">Guix
Packager</a> is a new
web user interface to get you started—<a href="https://guix-hpc.gitlabpages.inria.fr/guix-packager/">try
it!</a>.  It arrived
right in time as an aid to the <a href="https://hpc.guix.info/events/2023/workshop/program/#how-to-get-started-writing-guix-packages">packaging
tutorial</a>
given last week at the Workshop on Reproducible Software Environments.</p><p><img src="https://guix.gnu.org/static/blog/img/guix-packager.gif" alt="Screenshot showing the Guix Packager interface."></p><p>The interface aims to be intuitive: fill in forms on the left
and it produces a correct, ready-to-use package definition on the right.
Importantly, it helps you avoid pitfalls that trip up many newcomers:</p><ul><li>When you add a dependency in one of the “Inputs” fields, it adds the
right variable name in the generated code <em>and</em> imports the right
<a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Package-Modules.html">package
module</a>.</li><li>Likewise, you can choose a license and be sure the <code>license</code> field
will refer to the right variable representing that license.</li><li>You can turn tests on and off, and add configure flags.  These
translate to a valid <code>arguments</code> field of your package, letting you
discover the likes of <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/cookbook/en/html_node/A-Scheme-Crash-Course.html">keyword
arguments</a>
and
<a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/G_002dExpressions.html">G-expressions</a>
without having to first dive into the manual.</li></ul><p>Pretty cool, no?</p><h2>Implementation</h2><p>All the credit for this tool goes to co-worker and intrepid hacker
Philippe Virouleau.  A unique combination of paren aversion and web
development superpowers—unique in the Guix community—led
Philippe to develop the whole thing in a glimpse (says Ludovic!).</p><p>The purpose was to provide a single view to be able to edit a package recipe,
therefore the application is a <em>single-page application</em> (SPA) written in
using the UI library Philippe is most comfortable with: <a href="https://react.dev/">React</a>,
and <a href="https://mui.com/material-ui/">MaterialUI</a> for styling the components.
It's built with <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, and the library
part actually defines all the types needed to manipulate Guix packages and their
components (such as build systems or package sources).
One of the more challenging parts was to be able to provide fast and helpful “search as you
type” results over the 28k+ packages. It required a combination of
MaterialUI's <a href="https://mui.com/material-ui/react-autocomplete/#virtualization">virtualized inputs</a>,
as well as caching the packages data in the browser's local storage,
when possible (packaging metadata itself is fetched from
<code>https://guix.gnu.org/packages.json</code>, a generic representation of the
current package set).</p><p>While the feature set provides a great starting point, there are still a few
things that may be worth implementing.  For instance, only the GNU and
CMake build systems are supported so far; it would make sense to include
a few others (Python-related ones might be good candidates).</p><p>Running a local (development) version of the application can happen on
top of Guix, since—obviously—it's been developed with the <code>node</code>
version packaged in Guix, using the quite standard <code>packages.json</code> for
JavaScript dependencies installed through <code>npm</code>.  <a href="https://gitlab.inria.fr/guix-hpc/guix-packager/">Contributions
welcome!</a></p><h2>Lowering the barrier to entry</h2><p>This neat tool complements a set of steps we’ve taken over time to make
packaging in Guix approachable.  Indeed, while package definitions are
actually code written in the Scheme language, the <code>package</code> “language”
was designed <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4584">from the get-go</a> to be
fully declarative—think JSON with parens instead of curly braces and
semicolons.  More recently we <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2021/the-big-change/">simplified the way package inputs are
specified</a> with an
eye on making package definitions less intimidating.</p><p>The <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Invoking-guix-import.html"><code>guix import</code>
command</a>
also exists to make it easier to simplify packaging: it can generate a
package definition for anything available in other package
repositories such as PyPI, CRAN, Crates.io, and so forth.  If your
preference goes to curly braces rather than parens, it can also <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Invoking-guix-import.html#index-JSON_002c-import">convert
a JSON package
description</a>
to Scheme code.  Once you have your first <code>.scm</code> file, <code>guix build</code>
prints hints for common errors such missing module imports (those
<code>#:use-module</code> stanzas).  We also put effort into providing <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Defining-Packages.html">reference
documentation</a>,
a <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/en/videos/2020/packaging-part-two/">video
tutorial</a>, and
a <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/cookbook/en/html_node/Packaging-Tutorial.html">tutorial for more complex
packages</a>.</p><p>Do share your experience <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/contact">with us</a> and
until then, happy packaging!</p><h2>Acknowledgments</h2><p>Thanks to Felix Lechner and Timothy Sample for providing feedback on an

        <section>
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>VectorDB is a lightweight Python package for storing and retrieving text using chunking, embedding, and vector search techniques. It provides an easy-to-use interface for saving, searching, and managing textual data with associated metadata and is designed for use cases where low latency is essential.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h2>Documentation and code</h2>
            VectorDB is open-source. Check  <a href="https://github.com/kagisearch/vectordb">VectorDB on
            GitHub</a> for code and full documentation.
        <section>
        
            <h2>Installation</h2>
            <pre><code>pip install vectordb2</code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Usage</h2>
            <pre><code>from vectordb import Memory

memory = Memory()

# text = "..."
# metadata = {...}

# Save text with metadata
# This will automatically embed content
memory.save(text, metadata)

# Search for top n relevant chunks
# We will automatically use the fastest vector search backend
results = memory.search(query, top_n=3)</code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Why use vector search and embeddings with large language models?</h2>
            <p>Vector search and embeddings are essential when working with large language models because they enable efficient and accurate retrieval of relevant information from massive datasets. By converting text into high-dimensional vectors, these techniques allow for quick comparisons and searches, even when dealing with millions of documents. This makes it possible to find the most relevant results in a fraction of the time it would take using traditional text-based search methods. Additionally, embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text, which helps improve the quality of the search results and enables more advanced natural language processing tasks.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <pre><code>from vectordb import Memory

memory = Memory(chunking_strategy={'mode':'sliding_window', 'window_size': 128, 'overlap': 16})

Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data,
identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

Machine learning algorithms are trained on data sets that contain examples of the desired output. For example, a machine learning algorithm that is used to classify images might be trained on a data set that contains images of cats and dogs.
Once an algorithm is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new data. For example, the machine learning algorithm that is used to classify images could be used to predict whether a new image contains a cat or a dog.

Machine learning algorithms can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. Some common applications of machine learning include:

Classification: Categorizing data into different groups. For example, a machine learning algorithm could be used to classify emails as spam or not spam.

Regression: Predicting a continuous value. For example, a machine learning algorithm could be used to predict the price of a house.

Clustering: Finding groups of similar data points. For example, a machine learning algorithm could be used to find groups of customers with similar buying habits.

Anomaly detection: Finding data points that are different from the rest of the data. For example, a machine learning algorithm could be used to find fraudulent credit card transactions.

Machine learning is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. As the amount of data available continues to grow, machine learning is likely to become even more important in the future.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines
that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.

The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with
a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

AI research has been highly successful in developing effective techniques for solving a wide range of problems, from game playing to medical diagnosis.

However, there is still a long way to go before AI can truly match the intelligence of humans. One of the main challenges is that human intelligence is incredibly complex and poorly understood.

Despite the challenges, AI is a rapidly growing field with the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives. Some of the potential benefits of AI include:

Increased productivity: AI can be used to automate tasks that are currently performed by humans, freeing up our time for more creative and fulfilling activities.

Improved decision-making: AI can be used to make more informed decisions, based on a wider range of data than humans can typically access.

Enhanced creativity: AI can be used to generate new ideas and solutions, beyond what humans can imagine on their own.
Of course, there are also potential risks associated with AI, such as:

Job displacement: As AI becomes more capable, it is possible that it will displace some human workers.

Weaponization: AI could be used to develop new weapons that are more powerful and destructive than anything we have today.

Loss of control: If AI becomes too powerful, we may lose control over it, with potentially disastrous consequences.

It is important to weigh the potential benefits and risks of AI carefully as we continue to develop this technology. With careful planning and oversight, AI has the potential to make the world a better place. However, if we are not careful, it could also lead to serious problems.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">




<p>Terry Bisson, 1991</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Someone did a <a href="http://www.scifi.com/set/originals/meat/description.html">radio play</a> of this... 
</p></blockquote>


<p>"They're made out of meat."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meat?"

</p><p>"Meat. They're made out of meat."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meat?"

</p><p>"There's no doubt about it. We picked several from different parts of the planet, took them aboard our recon vessels, probed them all the way through. They're completely meat."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's impossible. What about the radio signals? The messages to the stars."

</p><p>"They use the radio waves to talk, but the signals don't come from them. The signals come from machines."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"So who made the machines? That's who we want to contact."

</p><p>"They made the machines. That's what I'm trying to tell you. Meat made the machines."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's ridiculous. How can meat make a machine? You're asking me to believe in sentient meat."

</p><p>"I'm not asking you, I'm telling you. These creatures are the only sentient race in the sector and they're made out of meat."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe they're like the Orfolei. You know, a carbon-based intelligence that goes through a meat stage."

</p><p>"Nope. They're born meat and they die meat. We studied them for several of their life spans, which didn't take too long. Do you have any idea the life span of meat?"

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Spare me. Okay, maybe they're only part meat. You know, like the Weddilei. A meat head with an electron plasma brain inside."

</p><p>"Nope. We thought of that, since they do have meat heads like the Weddilei. But I told you, we probed them. They're meat all the way through."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"No brain?"

</p><p>"Oh, there is a brain all right. It's just that the brain is made out of meat!"

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"So... what does the thinking?"

</p><p>"You're not understanding, are you? The brain does the thinking. The meat."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thinking meat! You're asking me to believe in thinking meat!"

</p><p>"Yes, thinking meat! Conscious meat! Loving meat. Dreaming meat. The meat is the whole deal! Are you getting the picture?"

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Omigod. You're serious then. They're made out of meat."

</p><p>"Finally, Yes. They are indeed made out meat. And they've been trying to get in touch with us for almost a hundred of their years."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what does the meat have in mind."

</p><p>"First it wants to talk to us. Then I imagine it wants to explore the universe, contact other sentients, swap ideas and information. The usual."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"We're supposed to talk to meat?"

</p><p>"That's the idea. That's the message they're sending out by radio. 'Hello. Anyone out there? Anyone home?' That sort of thing."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"They actually do talk, then. They use words, ideas, concepts?"

</p><p>"Oh, yes. Except they do it with meat."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you just told me they used radio."

</p><p>"They do, but what do you think is on the radio? Meat sounds. You know how when you slap or flap meat it makes a noise? They talk by flapping their meat at each other. They can even sing by squirting air through their meat."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Omigod. Singing meat. This is altogether too much. So what do you advise?"

</p><p>"Officially or unofficially?"

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Both."

</p><p>"Officially, we are required to contact, welcome, and log in any and all sentient races or multibeings in the quadrant, without prejudice, fear, or favor. Unofficially, I advise that we erase the records and forget the whole thing."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was hoping you would say that."

</p><p>"It seems harsh, but there is a limit. Do we really want to make contact with meat?"

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree one hundred percent. What's there to say?" `Hello, meat. How's it going?' But will this work? How many planets are we dealing with here?"

</p><p>"Just one. They can travel to other planets in special meat containers, but they can't live on them. And being meat, they only travel through C space. Which limits them to the speed of light and makes the possibility of their ever making contact pretty slim. Infinitesimal, in fact."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"So we just pretend there's no one home in the universe."

</p><p>"That's it."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cruel. But you said it yourself, who wants to meet meat? And the ones who have been aboard our vessels, the ones you have probed? You're sure they won't remember?"

</p><p>"They'll be considered crackpots if they do. We went into their heads and smoothed out their meat so that we're just a dream to them."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"A dream to meat! How strangely appropriate, that we should be meat's dream."

</p><p>"And we can marked this sector unoccupied."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. Agreed, officially and unofficially. Case closed. Any others? Anyone interesting on that side of the galaxy?"

</p><p>"Yes, a rather shy but sweet hydrogen core cluster intelligence in a class nine star in G445 zone. Was in contact two galactic rotation ago, wants to be friendly again."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"They always come around."

</p><p>"And why not? Imagine how unbearably, how unutterably cold the universe would be if one were all alone."

Down side: I guess you really have to believe that that a bad actor can’t decrypt it. And you have to pay for domain name.</li><li>With only four TXT recrods that’s ~1KB of compressed data. Some demoscene intros can be stored in TXT records.</li><li>You could theoretically store an arbitrary amount of data, if there is no limit on the number of TXT records you can create. I haven’t tried this, but would like to know what the limit is.
More registrars need to have APIs for updating records. With an API, one could programatically update TXT records.</li></ul></div></div>]]></description>

            <div>
                <p>Dear fellow NewPipers,</p>

<p>As you read in the headline: I (Schabi) have lost access to about €6,400 worth of bounties on https://bountysource.com/.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>Bountysource is a website which acts as a platform for the placement of bounties for open source development. People can use it to post bounties to fix certain issues or develop certain features.</p>

<p>Developers can take on these challenges, implement the changes, and get the bounty awarded to them. This also happened in the NewPipe project, where bounties were handled by Team NewPipe. I had set up the account for Team NewPipe on Bountysource, which accumulated a significant sum of money over the years.</p>

<p>Bountysource ownership had a bit of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bountysource#History">tumultuous history</a>, but the present owner seems to be <em>The Blockchain Group</em>, a company based in France.</p>

<h3 id="current-situation-for-me">Current situation for me</h3>

<p>I can attest that their back-end has stopped working, and they have stopped responding to communication attempts. My e-mail to them sent on 7 November, 2023 has not been answered.</p>

<p>Initially, I thought that this was too significant a sum to simply accept as a loss. Therefore, I reached out to a lawyer. However, the costs of hiring one, added to the court fees for initiating the proceedings, are too high to warrant pursuing this, however; not to mention the significant time I would have to spend with a legal case, which I cannot spare right now.</p>

<h3 id="why-so-much-unclaimed-money">Why so much unclaimed money</h3>

<p>Team NewPipe consists of volunteers, meaning we spend whatever free time we find during our days on NewPipe. This means that making a one-time decision like “Sure, we will accept money via platform X” will boil down to someone doing just that, and the decision then gets published. This happened with Bountysource, and it was used by quite a few people.</p>

<p>However, actually deciding on what to do with that money is a totally different challenge. Just paying it forward to active developers would have worked (after finding out a way to split it fairly), but we did not want to get paid for working on a passion project, and we didn’t want to attract developers who would contribute solely for the money.</p>

<p>We could have also used it to fund non-monetary rewards (maybe an online course to get better at programming, or paying for a faster computer to speed up development), but this meant an additional effort to decide who gets what, how it gets there, et cetera. So nothing really happened with the money.</p>

<p>To make a long story short: there has been a lot of discussion on how to improve the situation (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/2732">issue #2732</a>), and we ended up choosing to donate all money towards an association.</p>

<p>Therefore, we actually founded said association, targeted at projects like NewPipe. This association can now take money from donations, and spend it on clearly stated goals in an open and accessible way. Sadly, this again being a team effort of volunteers, we have not been able to publish an online presence yet, so you have to bear with us on that front.</p>

<p>Since we now have a bank account to forward the money to, I wanted to access the Bountysource money as well, and stumbled into this situation, where we are stuck as of now.</p>

<p>I can’t offer any condolences, sadly. This is really just a notification to everyone who thought they donated to Team NewPipe via Bountysource: that money is probably lost and didn’t reach us. Sorry.</p>

<p>Best regards,
Schabi</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://danluu.com/malloc-tutorial/">https://danluu.com/malloc-tutorial/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38418449">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Let's write a <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/malloc.3.html">malloc</a> and see how it works with existing programs!</p> <p>This tutorial is going to assume that you know what pointers are, and that you know enough C to know that <code>*ptr</code> dereferences a pointer, <code>ptr-&gt;foo</code> means <code>(*ptr).foo</code>, that malloc is used to <a href="http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/post/how-the-kernel-manages-your-memory/">dynamically allocate space</a>, and that you're familiar with the concept of a linked list. For a basic intro to C, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0673999866/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0673999866&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=abroaview-20&amp;linkId=5C3DNUKAQELP2KUL">Pointers on C</a> is one of my favorite books. If you want to look at all of this code at once, it's available <a href="https://github.com/danluu/malloc-tutorial/blob/master/malloc.c">here</a>.</p> <p>Preliminaries aside, malloc's function signature is</p> <pre><code>void *malloc(size_t size);
</code></pre> <p>It takes as input a number of bytes and returns a pointer to a block of memory of that size.</p> <p>There are a number of ways we can implement this. We're going to arbitrarily choose to use <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sbrk.2.html">sbrk</a>. The OS reserves stack and heap space for processes and sbrk lets us manipulate the heap. <code>sbrk(0)</code> returns a pointer to the current top of the heap. <code>sbrk(foo)</code> increments the heap size by <code>foo</code> and returns a pointer to the previous top of the heap.</p>  <p><img src="https://danluu.com/images/malloc-tutorial/heap.png" alt="Diagram of linux memory layout, courtesy of Gustavo Duarte." width="194" height="301"></p> <p>If we want to implement a really simple malloc, we can do something like</p> <pre><code>#include &lt;assert.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;


void *malloc(size_t size) {
  void *p = sbrk(0);
  void *request = sbrk(size);
  if (request == (void*) -1) {
    return NULL; // sbrk failed.
  } else {
    assert(p == request); // Not thread safe.
    return p;
  }
}
</code></pre> <p>When a program asks malloc for space, malloc asks sbrk to increment the heap size and returns a pointer to the start of the new region on the heap. This is missing a technicality, that <code>malloc(0)</code> should either return <code>NULL</code> or another pointer that can be passed to free without causing havoc, but it basically works.</p> <p>But speaking of free, how does free work? Free's prototype is</p> <pre><code>void free(void *ptr);
</code></pre> <p>When free is passed a pointer that was previously returned from malloc, it's supposed to free the space. But given a pointer to something allocated by our malloc, we have no idea what size block is associated with it. Where do we store that? If we had a working malloc, we could malloc some space and store it there, but we're going to run into trouble if we need to call malloc to reserve space each time we call malloc to reserve space.</p> <p>A common trick to work around this is to store meta-information about a memory region in some space that we squirrel away just below the pointer that we return. Say the top of the heap is currently at <code>0x1000</code> and we ask for <code>0x400</code> bytes. Our current malloc will request <code>0x400</code> bytes from <code>sbrk</code> and return a pointer to <code>0x1000</code>. If we instead save, say, <code>0x10</code> bytes to store information about the block, our malloc would request <code>0x410</code> bytes from <code>sbrk</code> and return a pointer to <code>0x1010</code>, hiding our <code>0x10</code> byte block of meta-information from the code that's calling malloc.</p> <p>That lets us free a block, but then what? The heap region we get from the OS has to be contiguous, so we can't return a block of memory in the middle to the OS. Even if we were willing to copy everything above the newly freed region down to fill the hole, so we could return space at the end, there's no way to notify all of the code with pointers to the heap that those pointers need to be adjusted.</p> <p>Instead, we can mark that the block has been freed without returning it to the OS, so that future calls to malloc can use re-use the block. But to do that we'll need be able to access the meta information for each block. There are a lot of possible solutions to that. We'll arbitrarily choose to use a single linked list for simplicity.</p> <p>So, for each block, we'll want to have something like</p> <pre><code>struct block_meta {
  size_t size;
  struct block_meta *next;
  int free;
  int magic; // For debugging only. TODO: remove this in non-debug mode.
};

#define META_SIZE sizeof(struct block_meta)
</code></pre> <p>We need to know the size of the block, whether or not it's free, and what the next block is. There's a magic number here for debugging purposes, but it's not really necessary; we'll set it to arbitrary values, which will let us easily see which code modified the struct last.</p> <p>We'll also need a head for our linked list:</p> <pre><code>void *global_base = NULL;
</code></pre> <p>For our malloc, we'll want to re-use free space if possible, allocating space when we can't re-use existing space. Given that we have this linked list structure, checking if we have a free block and returning it is straightforward. When we get a request of some size, we iterate through our linked list to see if there's a free block that's large enough.</p> <pre><code>struct block_meta *find_free_block(struct block_meta **last, size_t size) {
  struct block_meta *current = global_base;
  while (current &amp;&amp; !(current-&gt;free &amp;&amp; current-&gt;size &gt;= size)) {
    *last = current;
    current = current-&gt;next;
  }
  return current;
}
</code></pre> <p>If we don't find a free block, we'll have to request space from the OS using sbrk and add our new block to the end of the linked list.</p> <pre><code>struct block_meta *request_space(struct block_meta* last, size_t size) {
  struct block_meta *block;
  block = sbrk(0);
  void *request = sbrk(size + META_SIZE);
  assert((void*)block == request); // Not thread safe.
  if (request == (void*) -1) {
    return NULL; // sbrk failed.
  }

  if (last) { // NULL on first request.
    last-&gt;next = block;
  }
  block-&gt;size = size;
  block-&gt;next = NULL;
  block-&gt;free = 0;
  block-&gt;magic = 0x12345678;
  return block;
}
</code></pre> <p>As with our original implementation, we request space using <code>sbrk</code>. But we add a bit of extra space to store our struct, and then set the fields of the struct appropriately.</p> <p>Now that we have helper functions to check if we have existing free space and to request space, our malloc is simple. If our global base pointer is <code>NULL</code>, we need to request space and set the base pointer to our new block. If it's not <code>NULL</code>, we check to see if we can re-use any existing space. If we can, then we do; if we can't, then we request space and use the new space.</p> <pre><code>void *malloc(size_t size) {
  struct block_meta *block;
  // TODO: align size?

  if (size &lt;= 0) {
    return NULL;
  }

  if (!global_base) { // First call.
    block = request_space(NULL, size);
    if (!block) {
      return NULL;
    }
    global_base = block;
  } else {
    struct block_meta *last = global_base;
    block = find_free_block(&amp;last, size);
    if (!block) { // Failed to find free block.
      block = request_space(last, size);
      if (!block) {
        return NULL;
      }
    } else {      // Found free block
      // TODO: consider splitting block here.
      block-&gt;free = 0;
      block-&gt;magic = 0x77777777;
    }
  }

  return(block+1);
}
</code></pre> <p>For anyone who isn't familiar with C, we return block+1 because we want to return a pointer to the region after block_meta. Since block is a pointer of type <code>struct block_meta</code>, <code>+1</code> increments the address by one <code>sizeof(struct block_meta)</code>.</p> <p>If we just wanted a malloc without a free, we could have used our original, much simpler malloc. So let's write free! The main thing free needs to do is set <code>-&gt;free</code>.</p> <p>Because we'll need to get the address of our struct in multiple places in our code, let's define this function.</p> <pre><code>struct block_meta *get_block_ptr(void *ptr) {
  return (struct block_meta*)ptr - 1;
}
</code></pre> <p>Now that we have that, here's free:</p> <pre><code>void free(void *ptr) {
  if (!ptr) {
    return;
  }

  // TODO: consider merging blocks once splitting blocks is implemented.
  struct block_meta* block_ptr = get_block_ptr(ptr);
  assert(block_ptr-&gt;free == 0);
  assert(block_ptr-&gt;magic == 0x77777777 || block_ptr-&gt;magic == 0x12345678);
  block_ptr-&gt;free = 1;
  block_ptr-&gt;magic = 0x55555555;
}
</code></pre> <p>In addition to setting <code>-&gt;free</code>, it's valid to call free with a NULL ptr, so we need to check for NULL. Since free shouldn't be called on arbitrary addresses or on blocks that are already freed, we can assert that those things never happen.</p> <p>You never really need to assert anything, but it often makes debugging a lot easier. In fact, when I wrote this code, I had a bug that would have resulted in silent data corruption if these asserts weren't there. Instead, the code failed at the assert, which make it trivial to debug.</p> <p>Now that we've got malloc and free, we can write programs using our custom memory allocator! But before we can drop our allocator into existing code, we'll need to implement a couple more common functions, realloc and calloc. Calloc is just malloc that initializes the memory to 0, so let's look at realloc first. Realloc is supposed to adjust the size of a block of memory that we've gotten from malloc, calloc, or realloc.</p> <p>Realloc's function prototype is</p> <pre><code>void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size)
</code></pre> <p>If we pass realloc a NULL pointer, it's supposed to act just like malloc. If we pass it a previously malloced pointer, it should free up space if the size is smaller than the previous size, and allocate more space and copy the existing data over if the size is larger than the previous size.</p> <p>Everything will still work if we don't resize when the size is decreased and we don't free anything, but we absolutely have to allocate more space if the size is increased, so let's start with that.</p> <pre><code>void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size) {
  if (!ptr) {
    // NULL ptr. realloc should act like malloc.
    return malloc(size);
  }

  struct block_meta* block_ptr = get_block_ptr(ptr);
  if (block_ptr-&gt;size &gt;= size) {
    // We have enough space. Could free some once we implement split.
    return ptr;
  }

  // Need to really realloc. Malloc new space and free old space.
  // Then copy old data to new space.
  void *new_ptr;
  new_ptr = malloc(size);
  if (!new_ptr) {
    return NULL; // TODO: set errno on failure.
  }
  memcpy(new_ptr, ptr, block_ptr-&gt;size);
  free(ptr);
  return new_ptr;
}
</code></pre> <p>And now for calloc, which just clears the memory before returning a pointer.</p> <pre><code>void *calloc(size_t nelem, size_t elsize) {
  size_t size = nelem * elsize; // TODO: check for overflow.
  void *ptr = malloc(size);
  memset(ptr, 0, size);
  return ptr;
}
</code></pre> <p>Note that this doesn't check for overflow in <code>nelem * elsize</code>, which is actually required by the spec. All of the code here is just enough to get something that kinda sorta works.</p> <p>Now that we have something that kinda works, we can use our with existing programs (and we don't even need to recompile the programs)!</p> <p>First, we need to compile our code. On linux, something like</p> <pre><code>clang -O0 -g -W -Wall -Wextra -shared -fPIC malloc.c -o malloc.so
</code></pre> <p>should work.</p> <p><code>-g</code> adds debug symbols, so we can look at our code with <code>gdb</code> or <code>lldb</code>. <code>-O0</code> will help with debugging, by preventing individual variables from getting optimized out. <code>-W -Wall -Wextra</code> adds extra warnings. <code>-shared -fPIC</code> will let us dynamically link our code, which is what lets us <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/11/27/ld-preload-is-super-fun-and-easy/">use our code with existing binaries</a>!</p> <p>On macs, we'll want something like</p> <pre><code>clang -O0 -g -W -Wall -Wextra -dynamiclib malloc.c -o malloc.dylib
</code></pre> <p>Note that <code>sbrk</code> is deprecated on recent versions of OS X. Apple uses an unorthodox definition of deprecated -- some deprecated syscalls are badly broken. I didn't really test this on a Mac, so it's possible that this will cause weird failures or or just not work on a mac.</p> <p>Now, to use get a binary to use our malloc on linux, we'll need to set the <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> environment variable. If you're using bash, you can do that with</p> <pre><code>export LD_PRELOAD=/absolute/path/here/malloc.so
</code></pre> <p>If you've got a mac, you'll want</p> <pre><code>export DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/absolute/path/here/malloc.so
</code></pre> <p>If everything works, you can run some arbitrary binary and it will run as normal (except that it will be a bit slower).</p> <pre><code>$ ls
Makefile  malloc.c  malloc.so  README.md  test  test-0  test-1  test-2  test-3  test-4
</code></pre> <p>If there's a bug, you might get something like</p> <pre><code>$ ls
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
</code></pre> <h4 id="debugging">Debugging</h4> <p>Let's talk about debugging! If you're familiar with using a debugger to set breakpoints, inspect memory, and step through code, you can skip this section and go straight to <a href="#exercises">the exercises</a>.</p> <p>This section assumes you can figure out how to install gdb on your system. If you're on a mac, you may want to just use lldb and translate the commands appropriately. Since I don't know what bugs you might run into, I'm going to introduce a couple of bugs and show how I'd track them down.</p> <p>First, we need to figure out how to run gdb without having it segfault. If ls segfaults, and we try to run <code>gdb ls</code>, gdb is almost certainly going to segfault, too. We could write a wrapper to do this, but gdb also supports this. If we start gdb and then run <code>set environment LD_PRELOAD=./malloc.so</code> before running the program, <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> will work as normal.</p> <pre><code>$ gdb /bin/ls
(gdb) set environment LD_PRELOAD=./malloc.so
(gdb) run
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00007ffff7bd7dbd in free (ptr=0x0) at malloc.c:113
113       assert(block_ptr-&gt;free == 0);
</code></pre> <p>As expected, we get a segfault. We can look around with <code>list</code> to see the code near the segfault.</p> <pre><code>(gdb) list
108     }
109
110     void free(void *ptr) {
111       // TODO: consider merging blocks once splitting blocks is implemented.
112       struct block_meta* block_ptr = get_block_ptr(ptr);
113       assert(block_ptr-&gt;free == 0);
114       assert(block_ptr-&gt;magic == 0x77777777 || block_ptr-&gt;magic == 0x12345678);
115       block_ptr-&gt;free = 1;
116       block_ptr-&gt;magic = 0x55555555;
117     }
</code></pre> <p>And then we can use <code>p</code> (for print) to see what's going on with the variables here:</p> <pre><code>(gdb) p ptr
$6 = (void *) 0x0
(gdb) p block_ptr
$7 = (struct block_meta *) 0xffffffffffffffe8
</code></pre> <p><code>ptr</code> is <code>0</code>, i.e., <code>NULL</code>, which is the cause of the problem: we forgot to check for NULL.</p> <p>Now that we've figured that out, let's try a slightly harder bug. Let's say that we decided to replace our struct with</p> <pre><code>struct block_meta {
  size_t size;
  struct block_meta *next;
  int free;
  int magic;    // For debugging only. TODO: remove this in non-debug mode.
  char data[1];
};
</code></pre> <p>and then return <code>block-&gt;data</code> instead of <code>block+1</code> from malloc, with no other changes. This seems pretty similar to what we're already doing -- we just define a member that points to the end of the struct, and return a pointer to that.</p> <p>But here's what happens if we try to use our new malloc:</p> <pre><code>$ /bin/ls
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
gdb /bin/ls
(gdb) set environment LD_PRELOAD=./malloc.so
(gdb) run

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
_IO_vfprintf_internal (s=s@entry=0x7fffff7ff5f0, format=format@entry=0x7ffff7567370 "%s%s%s:%u: %s%sAssertion `%s' failed.\n%n", ap=ap@entry=0x7fffff7ff718) at vfprintf.c:1332
1332    vfprintf.c: No such file or directory.
1327    in vfprintf.c
</code></pre> <p>This isn't as nice as our last error -- we can see that one of our asserts failed, but gdb drops us into some print function that's being called when the assert fails. But that print function uses our buggy malloc and blows up!</p> <p>One thing we could do from here would be to inspect <code>ap</code> to see what <code>assert</code> was trying to print:</p> <pre><code>(gdb) p *ap
$4 = {gp_offset = 16, fp_offset = 48, overflow_arg_area = 0x7fffff7ff7f0, reg_save_area = 0x7fffff7ff730}
</code></pre> <p>That would work fine; we could poke around until we figure out what's supposed to get printed and figure out the fail that way. Some other solutions would be to write our own custom assert or to use the right hooks to prevent <code>assert</code> from using our malloc.</p> <p>But in this case, we know there are only a few asserts in our code. The one in malloc checking that we don't try to use this in a multithreaded program and the two in free checking that we're not freeing something we shouldn't. Let's look at free first, by setting a breakpoint.</p> <pre><code>$ gdb /bin/ls
(gdb) set environment LD_PRELOAD=./malloc.so
(gdb) break free
Breakpoint 1 at 0x400530
(gdb) run /bin/ls

Breakpoint 1, free (ptr=0x61c270) at malloc.c:112
112       if (!ptr) {
</code></pre> <p><code>block_ptr</code> isn't set yet, but if we use <code>s</code> a few times to step forward to after it's set, we can see what the value is:</p> <pre><code>(gdb) s
(gdb) s
(gdb) s
free (ptr=0x61c270) at malloc.c:118
118       assert(block_ptr-&gt;free == 0);
(gdb) p/x *block_ptr
$11 = {size = 0, next = 0x78, free = 0, magic = 0, data = ""}
</code></pre> <p>I'm using <code>p/x</code> instead of <code>p</code> so we can see it in hex. The <code>magic</code> field is 0, which should be impossible for a valid struct that we're trying to free. Maybe <code>get_block_ptr</code> is returning a bad offset? We have <code>ptr</code> available to us, so we can just inspect different offsets.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>I'm heading to Las Vegas for re:invent soon, perhaps the most boring type of
industry extravaganza there could be. In that spirit, I thought I would write
something quick and oddly professional: I'm going to complain about Docker.</p>
<p>Packaging software is one of those fundamental problems in system
administration. It's so important, so influential on the way a system is used,
that package managers are often the main identity of operating systems.
Consider Windows: the operating system's most alarming defect in the eyes of
many "Linux people" is its lack of package management, despite Microsoft's
numerous attempts to introduce the concept. Well, perhaps more likely,
<em>because</em> of the number of those attempts. And still, in the Linux world,
distributions are differentiated primarily by their approach to managing
software repositories. I don't just mean the difference between dpkg and
rpm, but rather more fundamental decisions, like opinionated vs. upstream
configuration and stable repositories vs. a rolling release. RHEL and Arch
share the vast majority of their implementation and yet have very different
<em>vibes.</em></p>
<p>Linux distributions have, for the most part, consolidated on a certain
philosophy of how software ought to be packaged, if not how often. One of the
basic concepts shared by most Linux systems is centralization of dependencies.
Libraries should be declared as dependencies, and the packages depended on
should be installed in a common location for use of the linker. This can create
a challenge: different pieces of software might depend on different versions of
a library, which may not be compatible. This is the central challenge of
maintaining a Linux distribution, in the classical sense: providing repositories
of software versions that will all work correctly together. One of the
advantages of stable distributions like RHEL is that they are very reliable in
doing this; one of the disadvantages is that they achieve that goal by
packaging new versions very infrequently.</p>
<p>Because of the need to provide mutually compatible versions of a huge range of
software, and to ensure compliance with all kinds of other norms established by
distributions (which may range from philosophical policies like free software
to rules on the layout of configuration files), putting new software into Linux
distributions can be... painful. For software maintainers, it means dealing
with a bunch of distributions using a bunch of old versions with various
specific build and configuration quirks. For distribution and package
maintainers, it means bending all kinds of upstream software into compliance
with distribution policy and figuring out version and dependency problems. It's
all a lot of work, and while there are some norms, in practice it's sort of a
wild scramble to do the work to make all this happen. Software developers that
want their software to be widely used have to put up with distros. Distros that
want software have to put up with software developers. Everyone gets mad.</p>
<p>Naturally there have been various attempts to ease these problems. Naturally
they are indeed various and the community has not really consolidated on any
one approach. In the desktop environment, Flatpak, Snap, and AppImage are all
distressingly common ways of distributing software. The images or applications
for these systems package the software complete with its dependencies,
providing a complete self-contained environment that should work correctly on
any distribution. The fact that I have multiple times had to unpack flatpaks
and modify them to fix dependencies reveals that this concept doesn't always
work entirely as advertised, but to be fair that kind of situation usually
crops up when the software has to interact with elements of the system that
the runtime can't properly isolate them from. The video stack is a classic
example, where errant OpenGL libraries in packages might have to be removed
or replaced for them to function with your particular graphics driver.</p>
<p>Still, these systems work <em>reasonably</em> well, well enough that they continue to
proliferate. They are greatly aided by the nature of the desktop applications
for which they're used (Snapcraft's system ambitions notwithstanding). Desktop
applications tend to interact mostly with the user and receive their
configuration via their own interface. Limiting the interaction surface mostly
to a GUI window is actually tremendously helpful in making sandboxing feasible,
although it continues to show rough edges when interacting with the file
system.</p>
<p>I will note that I'm barely mentioning sandboxing here because I'm just not
discussing it at the moment. Sandboxing is useful for security and even
stability purposes, but I'm looking at these tools primarily as a way of
packaging software for distribution. Sandboxed software can be distributed
by more conventional means as well, and a few crusty old packages show that
it's not as modern of a concept as it's often made out to be.</p>
<p>Anyway, what I really wanted to complain a bit about is the realm of software
intended to be run on servers. Here, there is a clear champion: Docker, and to
a lesser degree the ecosystem of compatible tools like Podman. The release of
Docker lead to a surprisingly rapid change in what are widely considered best
practices for server operations. While Docker images a means of distributing
software first seemed to appeal mostly to large scalable environments with
container orchestration, it sort of merged together with ideas from Vagrant and
others to become a common means of distributing software for developer and
single-node use as well.</p>
<p>Today, Docker is the most widespread way that server-side software is
distributed for Linux. I hate it.</p>
<p>This is not a criticism of containers in general. Containerization is a
wonderful thing with many advantages, even if the advantages over lightweight
VMs are perhaps not as great as commonly claimed. I'm not sure that Docker has
saved me more hours than it's cost, but to be fair I work as a DevOps
consultant and, as a general rule, people don't get me involved unless the
current situation isn't working properly. Docker images that run correctly with
minimal effort don't make for many billable hours.</p>
<p>What really irritates me these days is not really the use of Docker images in
DevOps environments that are, to some extent, centrally planned and managed.
The problem is the use of Docker as a lowest common denominator, or perhaps
more accurately lowest common effort, approach to distributing software to end
users. When I see open-source, server-side software offered to me as a Docker
image or--even worse---Docker Compose stack, my gut reaction is irritation.
These sorts of things usually take <em>longer</em> to get working than equivalent
software distributed as a conventional Linux package or to be built from
source.</p>
<p>But wait, how does that happen? Isn't Docker supposed to make everything
completely self-contained? Let's consider the common problems, something that
I will call my Taxonomy of Docker Gone Bad.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>One of the biggest problems with Docker-as-distribution is the lack of
consistent conventions for configuration. The vast majority of server-side
Linux software accepts its configuration through an ages-old technique of
reading a text file. This certainly isn't perfect! But, it is pretty consistent
in its general contours. Docker images, on the other hand...</p>
<p>If you subscribe to the principles of the 12-factor-app, the best way for a
Docker image to take configuration is probably via environment variables. This
has the upside that it's quite straightforward to provide them on the command
line when starting the container. It has the downside that environment
variables aren't great for conveying structured data, and you usually interact
with them via shell scripts that have clumsy handling of long or complicated
values. A lot of Docker images used in DevOps environments take their
configuration from environment variables, but they tend to make it a lot more
feasible by avoiding complex configuration (by assuming TLS will be terminated
by "someone else" for example) or getting a lot of their configuration from a
database or service on the network.</p>
<p>For most end-user software though, configuration is too complex or verbose to
be comfortable in environment variables. So, often, they fall back to
configuration files. You have to get the configuration file into the
container's file system <em>somehow,</em> and Docker provides numerous ways of doing
so. Documentation on different packages will vary on which way it recommends.
There are frequently caveats around ownership and permissions.</p>
<p>Making things worse, a lot of Docker images try to make configuration less
painful by providing some sort of entry-point shell script that generates the
full configuration from some simpler document provided to the container. Of
course this level of abstraction, often poorly documented or entirely
undocumented in practice, serves mostly to make troubleshooting a lot more
difficult. How many times have we all experienced the joy of software failing
to start, referencing some configuration key that isn't in what we provided,
leading us to have to find have the Docker image build materials and read the
entrypoint script to figure out how it generates that value?</p>
<p>The situation with configuration entrypoint scripts becomes particularly acute
when those scripts are opinionated, and opinionated is often a nice way of
saying "unsuitable for any configuration other than the developer's." Probably
at least a dozen times I have had to build my own version of a Docker image to
replace or augment an entrypoint script that doesn't expose parameters that
the underlying software accepts.</p>
<p>In the worst case, some Docker images provide no documentation at all, and
you have to shell into them and poke around to figure out where the actual
configuration file used by the running software is even located. Docker images
must <em>always</em> provide at least some basic README information on how the
packaged software is configured.</p>
<h2>Filesystems</h2>
<p>One of the advantages of Docker is sandboxing or isolation, which of course
means that Docker runs into the same problem that all sandboxes do. Sandbox
isolation concepts do not interact well with Linux file systems. You don't even
have to get into UID behavior to have problems here, just a Docker Compose
stack that uses named volumes can be enough to drive you to drink.  Everyday
operations tasks like backups, to say nothing of troubleshooting, can get a lot
more frustrating when you have to use a dummy container to interact with files
in a named volume. The porcelain around named volumes has improved over time,
but seemingly simple operations can still be weirdly inconsistent between
Docker versions and, worse, other implementations like Podman.</p>
<p>But then, of course, there's the UID thing. One of the great sins of Docker is
having normalized running software as root. Yes, Docker provides a degree of
isolation, but from a perspective of defense in depth running anything with
user exposure as root continues to be a poor practice. Of course this is one
thing that often leads me to have to rebuild containers provided by software
projects, and a number of common Docker practices don't make it easy. It all
gets much more complicated if you use hostmounts because of UID mapping, and
slightly complex environments with Docker can turn into NFS-style puzzles
around UID allocation. Mitigating this mess is one of the advantages to named
volumes, of course, with the pain points they bring.</p>
<h2>Non-portable Containers</h2>
<p>The irony of Docker for distribution, though, and especially Docker Compose, is
that there are a lot of common practices that negatively impact
portability---ostensibly the main benefit of this approach. Doing anything
non-default with networks in Docker Compose will often create stacks that don't
work correctly on machines with complex network setups. Too many Docker Compose
stacks like to assume that default, well-known ports are available for
listeners. They enable features of the underlying software without giving you a
way to disable them, and assume common values that might not work in your
environment.</p>
<p>One of the most common frustrations, for me personally, is TLS. As I have
already alluded to, I preach a general principle that Docker containers should
not terminate TLS. Accepting TLS connections means having access to the private
key material. Even if 90-day ephemeral TLS certificates and a general
atmosphere of laziness have deteriorated our discipline in this regard, private
key material should be closely guarded. It should be stored in only one place
and accessible to only one principal. You don't even have to get into these
types of lofty security concerns, though. TLS is also sort of complicated to
configure.</p>
<p>A lot of people who self-host software will have some type of SNI or virtual
hosting situation. There may be wildcard certificates for multiple subdomains
involved. All of this is best handled at a single point or a small number of
dedicated points. It is absolutely maddening to encounter Docker images built
with the assumption that they will individually handle TLS. Even with TLS
completely aside, I would probably never expose a Docker container with some
application directly to the internet. There are too many advantages to having a
reverse proxy in front of it. And yet there are Docker Compose stacks out there
for end-user software that want to use ACME to issue their own certificate!
Now you have to dig through documentation to figure out how to disable that
behavior.</p>
<h2>The Single-Purpose Computer</h2>
<p>All of these complaints are most common with what I would call hobby-tier
software. Two examples that pop into my mind are HomeAssistant and Nextcloud.
I don't call these hobby-tier to impugn the software, but rather to describe
the average user.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the kind of hobbyist that deploys software has had their mind
addled by the cheap high of the Raspberry Pi. I'm being hyperbolic here, but
this really is a problem. It's absurd the number of "self-hosted" software
packages that assume they will run on dedicated hardware. Having "pi" in the
name of a software product is a big red flag in my mind, it immediately makes
me think "they will not have documented how to run this on a shared device."
Call me old-fashioned, but I like my computers to perform more than one task,
especially the ones that are running up my power bill 24/7.</p>
<p>HomeAssistant is probably the biggest offender here, because I run it in Docker
on a machine with several other applications. It actively resists this, popping
up an "unsupported software detected" maintenance notification after every
update. Can you imagine if Postfix whined in its logs if it detected that it
had neighbors?</p>
<p>Recently I decided to give NextCloud a try. This was long enough ago that the
details elude me, but I think I burned around two hours trying to get the
all-in-one Docker image to work in my environment. Finally I decided to give
up and install it manually, to discover it was a plain old PHP application of
the type I was regularly setting up in 2007. Is this a problem with kids these
days? Do they not know how to fill in the config.php?</p>
<h2>Hiding Sins</h2>
<p>Of course, you will say, none of these problems would be widespread of people
just made good Docker images. And yes, that is completely true! Perhaps one of
the problems with Docker is that it's <em>too easy to use.</em> Creating an RPM or
Debian package involves a certain barrier to entry, and it takes a whole lot of
activation energy for even me to want to get rpmbuild going (advice: just use
copr and rpkg). At the core of my complaints is the fact that distributing an
application only as a Docker image is often evidence of a relatively immature
project, or at least one without anyone who specializes in distribution. You
have to expect a certain amount of friction in getting these sorts of things
to work in a nonstandard environment.</p>
<p>It is a palpable irony, though, that Docker was once heralded as the ultimate
solution to "works for me" and yet seems to just lead to the same situation
existing at a higher level of configuration.</p>
<h2>Last Thoughts</h2>
<p>This is of course mostly my opinion and I'm sure you'll disagree on something,
like my strong conviction that Docker Compose was one of the bigger mistakes of
our era. Fifteen years ago I might have written a nearly identical article
about all the problems I run into with RPMs created by small projects, but what
surprises me about Docker is that it seems like projects can get to a large
size, with substantial corporate backing, and still distribute in the form of a
decidedly amateurish Docker Compose stack. Some of it is probably the lack of
distribution engineering personnel on a lot of these projects, since Docker is
"simple." Some of it is just the changing landscape of this class of software,
with cheap single-board computers making Docker stacks just a little less
specialized than a VM appliance image more palatable than they used to be. But
some if it is also that I'm getting older and thus more cantankerous.</p>
