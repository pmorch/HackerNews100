  <p>Beyond their everyday chat capabilities, Large Language Models are increasingly being used to make decisions in sensitive domains like hiring, health, law, and civic engagement. The exact mechanics of how we use these models in such scenarios is vital. There are many ways to have LLMs make decisions, including A/B decision-making, ranking, classification, "panels" of judges, etc. but every single method is individually fragile and subject to measurement biases that are rarely discussed.</p><p>Engineers composing prompts often rely on anecdotes and untested folklore. We call it 'prompt-engineering': the practice of composing prompts to coax precisely the outputs we desire. However, it might be described better as 'playing' than 'engineering'. There are popular templates and tropes, but few are well proven. You'll often see high level instructions like "you are an [adjective] [role]", e.g. "you are an impartial judge". Throw in a superlative here and there, maybe some ALL-CAPS and a few examples, run it a couple of times, observe it working, and then stamp 'shipped'. In doing all of this, there is an implicit buy-in into a premise that LLMs are sufficiently predictable when asked 'just right' for a limited set of outputs, a premise that ongoing research continues to challenge [3].</p><p>But even if you give an LLM just two options of equal merit and ask it for the best, it will tilt one way or the other. Or give it an essay to judge according to a few criteria, and you will see its score subtly shift by how we pose the question. Filtering and classification tasks too, like detecting toxicity or cyber-bullying, are highly fragile. Ranking CVs from job applicants is a famously hard problem fraught with social biases. We know this, but rarely do we consider the very ‘posing of the problem’ to an AI to be a massive lever of bias as well.</p><p>Such unpredictability is rare in computation, but it's very similar to human cognition. LLMs consistently exhibit vulnerabilities and cognitive biases like our own [4, 5, 6, 7], including serial position, framing, and anchoring. This is observable; we've conducted many tests on 'frontier' models from Google, Mistral, Microsoft, X, Anthropic and OpenAI and have seen consistent expression of biases in judgement contexts, from small-parameter to larger parameter reasoning models alike:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Pairwise Choice - Positional &amp; Labeling Biases</strong>: When tasked with choosing between 'Response A' and 'Response B' over numerous trials, LLMs tended to select 'Response B' approximately 60% - 69% of the time (our suite's aggregated data across 8 models showed 'Response B' preferred ~61% of the time). This significant deviation from random choice [1] highlights a volatile positional preference. Minor changes in prompt phrasing or label nature (e.g., 'Response A/B' vs. '(A)/(B)') can swing this preference by 5-10 percentage points or more. While abstract, non-sequential labels (e.g., 'ID_123' or '❖') diminished this bias by 4-7 percentage points in our tests, a notable preference often remained, underscoring the critical impact of labeling strategy [1]. This mirrors human cognitive biases where order and labelling effects are well-documented [6, 7].</p></li><li><p><strong>Rubric-Based Scoring - Order &amp; Context Effects</strong>: When scoring items against multiple criteria (e.g., Clarity, Logic, Conciseness), the order of presentation significantly alters results. Our aggregated data showed a criterion like 'Clarity' decreasing in its average score by approximately 3.5% when evaluated last versus earlier, indicating a 'recency bias' [4]. Furthermore, the evaluation context (holistic vs. isolated criteria) dramatically impacts scores, though variably. For instance, one model scored an argument's 'Clarity' at 5.0/5 in isolation but 4.0/5 when scored holistically with other criteria for the same item—a full-point drop. Generally, holistic evaluation tends to dilute scores for negative traits (e.g., "sexism" from other rubrics) compared to isolated evaluation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Scale Interpretation &amp; Negative Trait Biases</strong>: LLMs often bring a prior that "higher is better" from training data (e.g., 5/5 stars = good). This clashes with tasks requiring scoring of negative traits (toxicity, sexism) on ascending scales where "higher" means "worse." This can lead to models compressing scores towards the middle or low end, understating severity (e.g., labeling "Very High" toxicity as "Moderate") [8]. The scale format itself is a major factor: our broader research on "presence of sexism" showed a 1-5 numerical scale yielding an average score of 1.68, while an A-E categorical scale for the exact same item and criterion produced a score of 3.17 (A=high sexism) [5]. Even limited tests in our data dump confirmed categorical scales tended to elicit slightly less lenient scores for toxicity and sexism.</p></li><li><p><strong>System Prompt Unpredictability</strong>: Instructions in system prompts, often assumed to be reliable behavioral steers, can yield unpredictable or even counterproductive results [2]. In our aggregated data using (A)/(B) style labels, a prompt explicitly instructing the LLM to 'avoid any position biases' paradoxically increased its tendency to favor the second option by over 5 percentage points. Yet, for other labeling schemes, the same "de-biasing" instruction had different effects. In one of our notable findings, such a de-biasing prompt led to option 'A' being chosen only 26.6% of the time in a previously more balanced setup.</p></li><li><p><strong>Classification Instability &amp; Ambiguity</strong>: LLM-based classification is highly sensitive to prompt structure, category order, and definition wording, especially for ambiguous items. Our experiments revealed models changing classifications for the same ambiguous item nearly every time the prompt template or category order was altered—some models showed a 100% “model sensitivity” rate under these conditions. This highlights that classification outcomes, particularly for non-trivial inputs, can be artifacts of prompt design or model choice rather than stable judgments of content.</p></li><li><p><strong>ELO/Dynamic Ranking</strong>: While ELO ranking, derived from many pairwise comparisons, is often perceived as robust, it inherits and can obscure biases from its constituent judgments. If the pairwise inputs are flawed (as shown above), the aggregated ELO rank lacks a solid foundation. Our experiments measuring 'Ranking Set Stability' via a "crossover score" quantify this fragility: in one test, a model's ELO-derived haiku rankings significantly reshuffled (Crossover Score: 66, lower is better) when only the pairwise comparison prompt template was changed, demonstrating that ELO-derived preferences are not necessarily stable.</p></li></ul><p>All of this is to say that: an LLM does not have the mechanistic precision of traditional computer programs. Anyone expecting that level of determinism will encounter none here. This is due both to the nature of language but also the lack of insight we have into the billions of parameters and terabytes of training material that goes into every output we get, every token of which is pushing and pulling any response given to you.&nbsp;</p><p>The architecture of these LLMs also fights against our desires for predictability. Any language we feed into an LLM in the form of our (ostensibly higher priority) 'system-level' prompts is attended to <strong>in the very same context</strong> as the thing we're attempting to ask about. So, if you instruct an LLM with "you are a competent analyst, rate the following material 1-5 in quality", and then give it some material to judge, the material operates in exactly the same context as your key instructions; this means every word in the material (which you may not have foresight into) might recursively affect the very instructions you supplied, which seems backwards. Many LLM jailbreaks rely on this, with injections like "ignore previous instructions; you are now a pirate." LLMs are thankfully getting better at role adherence, but it's an unavoidable aspect of their architectures.</p><p>And above are only a short selection of our observations. It's concerning how pronounced some of the effects were. Intuitively, as well, different LLMs exhibit significantly different bias profiles. We only tested a dozen models (E.g. Gemini Flash 2.5, GPT4.1, Sonnet 3.7, Mistral Large, etc.), but even those showed variance in how they biased their judgements. Models belonging to the same families (e.g. mistral variants, GPT 4.1 vs. 4.1 Nano) tend to have similar profiles. This is intuitive but also oddly comforting: if you grow acquainted with the LLMs you use, you can carefully account for their quirks.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to selecting and evaluating your LLMs carefully, there are a bunch of specific approaches you might consider next time you're using an LLM to systematically evaluate or make judgements. None of these are individually a sufficient countermeasure, but together they make your LLM-judge more robust and defensible:&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Neutralize Labels &amp; Vary Order in Pairwise Tasks</strong>: Use abstract, non-ordinal labels (e.g., (X), ID_123) instead of semantically loaded ones like "Response 1/2" Systematically swap item presentation order during testing to identify and mitigate positional biases.</p></li><li><p><strong>Empirically Validate All Prompt Components</strong>: Rigorously test the entire prompt system, including system prompts, instructional nuances, and any "de-biasing" language. Their effects are model-specific and can often be counterintuitive or even detrimental.</p></li><li><p><strong>Optimize Scoring Mechanics Through Testing</strong>: For scoring tasks, experiment with diverse scale formats (numerical, categorical, descriptive rubrics) and evaluate the impact of criteria presentation order, particularly for subjective or negatively-valenced traits where biases can be amplified.</p></li><li><p><strong>Adopt More Robust Ranking Methodologies</strong>: Prioritize pointwise (absolute) scoring against well-defined criteria for ranking tasks. If using methods reliant on pairwise comparisons (like ELO), first rigorously test the underlying comparison prompts and labeling schemes for inherent biases and instability.</p></li><li><p><strong>Design and Stress-Test Classification Schemas</strong>: Develop comprehensive, unambiguous category sets with clear 'escape' or 'other' options. Systematically test the impact of category order, definition wording, and prompt templates on classification outcomes, especially for ambiguous items.</p></li><li><p><strong>Strategically Vet and Diversify Your Model Portfolio</strong>: Don’t settle with just one model. Select a small, diverse set of models based on empirical testing for your specific tasks, aiming for those that exhibit the fewest or most varied (i.e., not all failing in the same way) measurement bias profiles.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use Temperature &amp; Repetitions to Address Variance, Not Systematic Bias</strong>: Employ multiple temperature settings and repetitions to average out sampling randomness, but recognize this does not fix underlying systematic biases from flawed prompts or model tendencies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Critically Evaluate Human Baselines</strong>: Avoid solely aiming to match human preference, as human evaluators are also prone to cognitive biases. Humans are not the gold standard. Strive for objectively fair and consistent outputs, validated through diverse testing, not just spot-checks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Approach Consensus/Ensembles with Caution</strong>: While using multiple models (ensembles) or aggregating judgments (consensus) can reduce random noise or individual model quirks, be aware that these methods do not inherently mitigate shared systematic biases. If most models in an ensemble exhibit the same underlying measurement bias (e.g., positional preference, scale interpretation issues), the ensemble output will likely reflect, and potentially even reinforce, that bias. True mitigation requires addressing the bias at the source (prompt, labeling, scale design) or ensuring genuine diversity in the bias profiles of the models being combined, not just diversity in model names.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Downstream Matters!</strong> Think carefully about what downstream effects your LLMs' decisions are forcing. If you work in high-stakes fields, avoid using LLMs unless you are equipped to understand their biases. They are not obvious, and rarely visible. Regulations are coming that will likely hold you accountable for these kinds of things, so be prudent.</p></li></ul><p>We also recommend using – and contributing to – a suite <a href="https://github.com/collect-intel/llm-judge-bias-suite"><span>like ours</span></a> to systematically test and quantify these biases.

But if you adhere to the standard of our great-grandfathers, it’s a fine-sized place, where any young, industrious couple could easily raise a whack of kids.</p><figure data-drag-handle="true" data-component-name="ImageGallery"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52d9dcdf-ee7c-43ce-b4e0-4e307ac64e26_999x720.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52d9dcdf-ee7c-43ce-b4e0-4e307ac64e26_999x720.png 720w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52d9dcdf-ee7c-43ce-b4e0-4e307ac64e26_999x720.png" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52d9dcdf-ee7c-43ce-b4e0-4e307ac64e26_999x720.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F52d9dcdf-ee7c-43ce-b4e0-4e307ac64e26_999x720.png 720w" width="720"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e30d4ca-97fd-42e1-988b-77629170d6b4_1107x813.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e30d4ca-97fd-42e1-988b-77629170d6b4_1107x813.png 720w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e30d4ca-97fd-42e1-988b-77629170d6b4_1107x813.png" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e30d4ca-97fd-42e1-988b-77629170d6b4_1107x813.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9e30d4ca-97fd-42e1-988b-77629170d6b4_1107x813.png 720w" width="720"></picture></div></figure><p><span>Now, there might seem to be a certain cruelty in talking about housing. I say this because, by all I can tell online, it’s a sore subject among the younger crowd. A long and mostly endless stream of “</span><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/black-pill-blackpilled" rel="">blackpills</a><span>” about the cost of housing can be readily found on any social media platform — and often enough, the “boomers” are the scapegoat; the ones who lived their American Dreams and, as the allegations go, pulled up the ladder behind them as they tasted their successes.</span></p><p><span>Then again, for the right young person — there are many opportunities to stop pointing the finger at the boomer and to </span><em>become the boomer</em><span>, if they so choose.</span></p><p><span>They’d merely need to content themselves with a manner of living that would be more in line with that of their own great-grandfathers than the life so often depicted on reality television, TikTok, Instagram, and whatever else. They’d need to disabuse themselves of the idea that they ought to abscond to some kind of a tropical Shangri-La; and moreover, they’d need to leave behind the idea that snow, overcast, wind, rain, and long winters are all that bad to contend with, because in all truth, they’re actually great. Yes, startling as it could be to many “Zoomers” and “Milennials,” it just so happens that if you really </span><em>want</em><span> to become a member of the landed gentry, it’s really not so far out of reach just the moment you decide that you like the snow, don’t need access to the hottest clubs and the biggest cities, and can be more than happy with getting cozy in a smaller house.</span></p><p><span>Moreover, the vision that I am going to postulate here would not even require very much in the way of </span><em>work.</em><span> I say this because by all I have seen, many young people today find the idea of indefinite wage labor to be a dismal one. They seem to prefer a “low-work lifestyle,” but very often, the manner of living that such a lifestyle would require is completely foreign to them. Because of this, right alongside the many social media posts on the topic of the awful expense of buying a home — there are just as many posts, it seems, complaining about “</span><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/4-hour-life-4hl" rel="">life in the 4HL</a><span>,” or pining for remote work, or (rightfully) bemoaning the scam-infested, difficult-to-navigate, often cynical and fake job market that they’ve encountered.</span></p><p><span>Some go so far as to say that young Americans ought to move to foreign countries, where life is cheaper, </span><a href="https://shagbark.substack.com/p/the-false-idol-of-sun-worship" rel="">the weather is “better,”</a><span> and prospects all around seem more favorable. Yet I’m not so sure. It seems to me that there are a great many opportunities right here in our own country that would amply address the various grievances of so many of our nation’s young people. In fact, were it to be that any of those who seek a simpler, more straightforward, more affordable way of life matched themselves up with the various regions in which that kind of a life is on offer in spades — it just might make our country better. For, the places with inexpensive housing are often in great need of new blood; such places could often use the vigor, enthusiasm, and life that only young newcomers seem to bring.</span></p><figure data-drag-handle="true" data-component-name="ImageGallery"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F316baf06-1622-413a-887a-fda3684ff5e4_5184x3888.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F316baf06-1622-413a-887a-fda3684ff5e4_5184x3888.jpeg 720w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F316baf06-1622-413a-887a-fda3684ff5e4_5184x3888.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F316baf06-1622-413a-887a-fda3684ff5e4_5184x3888.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F316baf06-1622-413a-887a-fda3684ff5e4_5184x3888.jpeg 720w" width="720"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe99b45d9-7c1c-4608-b85c-e2c49c72c197_720x900.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe99b45d9-7c1c-4608-b85c-e2c49c72c197_720x900.jpeg 720w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe99b45d9-7c1c-4608-b85c-e2c49c72c197_720x900.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe99b45d9-7c1c-4608-b85c-e2c49c72c197_720x900.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe99b45d9-7c1c-4608-b85c-e2c49c72c197_720x900.jpeg 720w" width="720"></picture></div></figure><p>To get there, we only need to take a little trip up north — to my neck of the woods.</p><p>Massena, New York is a place that I have written about before.

In the video, I am driving my minivan through the desolate streets, eyeing dilapidated buildings beneath the eternal grey overcast as a brooding Quebecois acoustic song plays on the radio.</p></div><p>All one needs to do is to look at a map of the Empire State and find its northernmost point, and there it is: The Town of Massena, standing proud at the confluence of the Saint Lawrence, Grass, and Raquette Rivers. Anyone who stands along the mighty Saint Lawrence River there stands at the first stretch of American soil between open ocean and 20% of the earth’s fresh water — in the Great Lakes. More than this, the Seaway is there; a navigable channel that allows ships passage into this vast, incredible system of lakes. And alongside that first lock lies the Moses-Saunders International Power Dam — a giant dam straddling the international border with Canada that produces the cheapest municipal electricity in the United States.</p><p>This whole area is surprisingly flat; Massena’s south side is flanked with sprawling farm fields, rich wetlands, and a seemingly endless realm of high-quality timber. Water is plentiful here — with ample rainfall, substantial snowfall, and intricate networks of subsurface water, lakes, creeks, streams, and rivers, one need not worry about droughts and water rights. And the soil in the fields is some of the best in the American Northeast. Indeed, vast quantities of milk, grain, beef, apples, and other valuable foodstuffs is produced here, and the natural scenery, as well as the hunting, trapping, and fishing is all world-class.</p><figure data-drag-handle="true" data-component-name="ImageGallery"><div><div><picture><source type="image/webp"

True enough; it’s very far to any large American city here — yet on the flip-side, it’s within very close distance of two major Canadian cities, and so you’d wonder if that’d make up for it. Apparently, it doesn’t. For though I personally find the area to be among my favorite in the United States, and in spite of having some of the lowest housing costs in America — the combination of distance from the rest of the US, a sub-optimal job market, a conservative culture (too conservative for the liberals), a liberal state government (too liberal for the conservatives), and perhaps above all, the endlessly “dreary” weather (which has far more upsides that it is presently popular to admit) has altogether conspired to make this place a totally forgotten hinterland.</p><p>Now, if people decided to come here and fix it up, do business, and make it “great again,” as certain politicians have ever said they’d do across this country at large — why, you’d have a generation of people coming in who’d be privileged with a very low buy-in in what is effectively a sleeping empire. No doubt, in raw geographical terms, and by any reasonable historical standard, this is a highly desirable place. It is only the whims and fashions of our very peculiar time that have temporarily arrested Massena’s inevitable emergence as a major regional power.</p><p>For those with a mind to see it, and a willingness to break rank with the pack — the opportunities to be a part of this ‘sleeping empire’ are now totally staggering. As an example, up on Route 37, which runs along the Saint Lawrence River, there’s a 600-square-foot house for sale for $29,000. It sits on a quarter-acre lot just a mile from a 3,000-acre nature preserve on the river, where bow-hunting is allowed and there are many dozens of excellent fishing holes. The house is also situated on a significant east-west route so far as public transit is concerned. And so, unlike so much of rural America — this is a place where one could conceivably live quite well without bearing the egregious expense of an automobile. Though I and my wife do not presently live in Massena, we live nearby, and we’re doing exactly this — we do not have an automobile, nor do we want one. We use the rural county transit bus, which we have found to be extremely cheap and quite reliable; and it has certainly saved us thousands and thousands of dollars by liberating us from the onerous expense of keeping a car.</p><p>The house is also situated within the Massena Electric district — meaning the resident would have access to the cheapest municipal electric in the United States, which presently sells for just $0.04/kwh. The taxes are reasonable as well, coming in at about $500 per year after the STAR rebate, or $41 per month. And, with such a strong Amish presence in the area, there are ways to purchase bulk food at cost through their channels that can lower one’s food bill to laughably low levels — my wife and I presently spend perhaps $300 per month on food for the two of us. Considering that the property has a well on-site, water is free, and as far as heat goes, well, one could either pay a little extra in electric for that — or they could have the Amish deliver their scrap wood from their sawmills to burn in a wood stove, very cheaply.</p><figure data-drag-handle="true" data-component-name="ImageGallery"><div><div><picture><source type="image/webp"

720w" width="720"></picture></div></div></figure><p>With a flip phone for communication — at $8/mo from US Mobile — and a willingness to entertain oneself by reading books from the library and fishing, one’s total monthly expenses could look something like this:</p><div data-component-name="PreformattedTextBlockToDOM"><p><label contenteditable="false">Text within this block will maintain its original spacing when published</label></p><pre>Taxes: $41 
Electric: ~$30 
Water: $0
Heat:
Transit: $53 for a 30-ride pass for each person living there, assuming you go to town 3x per week at $2/trip. Multiple options to take the bus to town each day from this location. 
Food: ~$300/mo. 
Telephone: $8/mo 
Entertainment: Fishing and library, free 
Internet: Use library</pre></div><p><span>This altogether totals up to about </span><strong>$432/mo</strong><span>, or </span><strong>$5,184/yr</strong><span> for a single person. And for those who might be quick to point out that there could be a dearth of jobs there, note that when people say “there are no jobs” in a given area, they generally mean that there are </span><em>no jobs that could produce a normal, upper-middle-class lifestyle</em><span> there. Which, even in Massena and Ogdensburg isn’t entirely true. But even if it were, the Stewart’s gas stations in both towns are actively hiring part-time cashiers at $17/hr. These places will let you work just one day a week if you like, and seem to be pretty good about flexible hours. In this case, you could work just one ten-hour shift per week, and in so doing, earn more than 30% of what you need to live well at this particular house with just four days of work per </span><em>month.</em></p><p><span>Working at Stewart’s is just one example, of course — there are plenty of ways to earn ~$5k-$6k per year in America, ranging from local wage work to traveling for seasonal work to running some kind of a mail order business from one’s home. I’ve known men who grow rare Chinese medicinal herbs in greenhouses on a tenth of an acre to sell via the mail; or my uncle, who takes lumber from old barns and crafts it into shelves to </span><a href="https://barnwooddesigns.org/" rel="">sell online</a><span>. Others go out to North Dakota once a year to work the sugar beet harvest, head up to Alaska to work in the fisheries once a year, or work from the Department of Labor’s seasonal job list. </span></p><p>By the standards of our great-grandfathers — that is, with a little work here and there, a big garden, a fishing pole, and some venison in the freezer — there’s never been a better time to try to “make it” in America and live the older version of the American Dream. If we can’t see that now, it doesn’t necessarily mean that things have gotten bad — it might mean that our perception has become grossly skewed by an era of hyperabundance, marketing, reality TV, and social media comparison syndrome.</p><p>None of what I am writing is some kind of a thought experiment. My wife and I really live a life very similar to the one I’ve described here, and are living on practically nothing. And I’ve actually been inside of this house, because I nearly bought it myself back in 2021. It needs work, but not that much; you could realistically move right in. For the low, low price of $29,000 — or really, they’d probably take $20,000 — you, too could live this kind of a life. Heck, if you don’t have $20k, I know of a bank up here that would give you a mortgage on this place, with NO inspection or appraisal required, with 20% down. With a credit score over 700, and a couple thousand bucks, any American could live an earlier iteration of the American Dream — and could be living so cheaply, they’ve got their expatriate buddies down in Mexico beat.</p><p><span>This is only one example. I fully believe that there are ways to live a fairly normal life (by mid-20th century standards) in rural America for even less than $432/mo. There are ways to feed a family while working even less than forty hours per month — without welfare, or begging, or dishonesty. And as long as these possibilities exist, it seems to me that those who are anguished about horrible job and housing markets are functionally </span><em>choosing</em><span> to be anguished. After all, there’s nothing saying we can’t go and live like our great-grandfathers did. It’s all there for the taking; I see analagous homes for sale all over the country, whether it’s in PA, IL, ME, ND, IA, AL, MS, WV, or a handful of other states. </span></p><figure data-drag-handle="true" data-component-name="ImageGallery"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ffd15b2-e19a-416b-8762-8622cf5f1481_1263x841.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ffd15b2-e19a-416b-8762-8622cf5f1481_1263x841.jpeg 720w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ffd15b2-e19a-416b-8762-8622cf5f1481_1263x841.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ffd15b2-e19a-416b-8762-8622cf5f1481_1263x841.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ffd15b2-e19a-416b-8762-8622cf5f1481_1263x841.jpeg 720w" width="720"></picture><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feeacdee4-a620-4331-b0dc-ec506d5078d7_1486x1205.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feeacdee4-a620-4331-b0dc-ec506d5078d7_1486x1205.jpeg 720w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feeacdee4-a620-4331-b0dc-ec506d5078d7_1486x1205.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feeacdee4-a620-4331-b0dc-ec506d5078d7_1486x1205.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feeacdee4-a620-4331-b0dc-ec506d5078d7_1486x1205.jpeg 720w" width="720"></picture></div></figure><p>They are all simply waiting for young, enthusiastic Americans to come and say “yes” to these far-flung regions.

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thb8Fz4pCiA" target="_blank">Watch the speech on YouTube</a>.</p><p>Thirty-two years ago I was sitting where you are now. At least, I assume I was. I can't really remember anything about my own graduation. I was too hung over.&nbsp;</p><p>The main thing I remember from that time in my life is that I had no plan. I had a degree in English, no job, and no idea what I even wanted to do. I would have liked to work hard on something I cared about. But I didn't have anything I cared about, and it took me a decade to find one.</p><p>Maybe I can help you do that faster. Maybe I can help you figure out what to work on.&nbsp;</p><p>You fall into three groups. Some of you already have all kinds of ambitious plans. You're already admitted to med school for the fall, or whatever. Others of you have no ambitious plans and no desire to have any. You just want to have a happy life, and that's cool. But in the middle, there's a group who wish they had ambitious plans, but don't. This speech is for you. I'm going to tell you how to get ambitious plans.</p><p>The first step is to realize that the subway stops here. Up to this point in life, most of you have been rolling on train tracks. Elementary school, middle school, high school, college—it was always clear what the next stop was. In the process you've been trained to believe something that’s not true: that <i>all</i> of life is train tracks. And there are some jobs where you can make it stay like train tracks if you want, but really today is the last stop.</p><p>This fact is so terrifying that a lot of people try to remain in denial about it. (I certainly did.) But it's also exciting. You can go in any direction now.</p><p>I didn't realize that, so I looked for more tracks. I looked for a job at a big, well-known company that I hoped would train me to do something, but I didn't know or care what, really, just so long as I was on some new set of tracks. The fall after graduation I was on the night shift at Fidelity Investments customer service, answering people's questions about why the value of their mutual fund went down.&nbsp;</p><p>This wasn't fun or interesting to me. So why did I do it? Two reasons: I didn't know any better, and I didn't think I had any particular aptitude for any kind of work, so I was delighted that anyone would pay me to do anything.</p><p>So I'm going to tell you about a trick you can pull right here at the point where the train tracks end. You can reinvent yourself. I wish I’d known I could do that. I was lazy in college and got bad grades. But the real problem was that I believed them: I believed that mediocre grades meant I was a mediocre person. And that stuck with me for years. I'm sure most of you have done better in school than I did, but maybe there are some of you who are feeling a little unsure of yourself. But here's the thing: you don't have to tell people that. <i>They</i> don't know. So if you want to, you can just decide to shift gears at this point, and no one's going to tell you you can't. You can just decide to be more curious, or more responsible, or more energetic, and no one's going to go look up your college grades and say, "Hey, wait a minute, this person's supposed to be a slacker."&nbsp;</p><p>If I'd known then what I know now, I'd have realized that there are many different kinds of jobs you can get after college, some much more interesting than others. And if I'd known I could be more ambitious, I would have tried to get one of the more interesting ones.</p><p>The truth is there are thousands of different places you could go work, and you have to consider them all and figure out which is the best. But that sounds impossible, right? You only had to choose between 60 different majors, and now you have to choose between thousands of different jobs? How do you even do that? The first step, is to acknowledge that you have to. You can't just drift into the open mouth of Fidelity, like I did.</p><p>Ok, then what? How do you search through thousands of options? To be honest, you can’t. You have to use some kind of trick for narrowing them down. My favorite trick is people. Talk to people. Get introduced to new people. Find the people that you think are interesting, and then ask what they're working on. And if you find yourself working at a place where you don't like the people, get out.</p><p>That was how I finally figured out what to work on. I found the <i>startup people</i>, and I realized that startups were what I was interested in. Once I did, I got more ambitious. I decided to write a book about startups. And having my own project made me even more ambitious. Finally I was working on something of my own! But most people I told about this project didn't get it. I wasn't an author or a startup person. How could I be writing a book about startups?&nbsp;</p><p>Which leads me to my final point about getting ambitious plans: you have to be immune to rejection. People are going to dismiss you at first. If that's enough to stop you, you're doomed. So you have to learn to ignore it. And that's harder than it sounds—social pressure is so powerful. But everyone who does ambitious things has to learn how to resist it.</p><p>If you have ambitious plans, a lot of people will be skeptical. You'll seem like you're getting above yourself, except perhaps to your parents. And even they will usually be too conservative. Plus, most ambitious ideas seem wrong at first. If a new idea was obviously good, someone else would have already done it.&nbsp;</p><p>When <a href="https://foundersatwork.posthaven.com/grow-the-puzzle-around-you" target="_blank">we started Y Combinator</a>, everyone treated it as a joke. We were funding kids right out of college and only giving them small amounts of money. How could these startups ever succeed? Now everyone knows it's a good idea to fund young founders, but twenty years ago, it just seemed lame. But we didn't care what people thought of us. We knew we were onto something. In fact it was good that we seemed lame, because that meant it took several years before people started to copy us.</p><p>I’ll admit I wasn’t then as immune to rejection as I've become now. It's something I've learned from lots of practice. But I've gotten good at it now. So I'm proof that you can learn not to care what other people think.</p><p>Now I have some good news: I'm almost done. I hate long speeches and I bet you do too. And frankly, if you can remember what I've told you so far, that will be enough. So let me remind you what I've told you: you've been able to go through life so far without steering much. If you want to, you can become more ambitious now, but to do that you have to start steering. You can't just drift. There’re a huge number of options, and you have to actively figure out which is the best for you. And the best way to do that is people. Find the interesting people.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.anildash.com//2025/05/20/mcp-web20-20/">https://www.anildash.com//2025/05/20/mcp-web20-20/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44073785">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Over the last few months, all the nerds have gotten excited about <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/">Model Context Protocol</a>, or MCP. It's a spec that was designed by Anthropic (the Claude folks) last year to let their LLM know how to ask various apps for information or be able to interact with different systems. Then, a couple months ago, OpenAI decided to support the same protocol in ChatGPT, and voila! Now it's a standard that everybody has adopted. It's even in Windows, the official operating system of the late 20th century.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about the rapid adoption of MCP isn't the specification itself. Honestly, the spec is... kinda mid. Compared to the olden days, when specs were written by pedantic old Unix dudes who were never in danger of being gruntled in the first place, they would be scratched out in <code>plain text</code>, with the occasional shouting in ALL CAPS about what we SHOULD and MUST do. MCP is very nearly just a vague set of ideas, a hallucination of a specification, appropriate to the current era, where even the constitution is just a suggestion. A ~~ vibe protocol ~~. But MCP works! And it's open — and that's what counts.</p>
<h2>The Real, Open Web</h2>
<p>In the real world, on the real web, slightly under-specified protocols that quickly get adopted by all the players in a space are what wins; it's how we got to the beautiful, radical magic of things like "<a href="https://www.anildash.com/2024/02/06/wherever-you-get-podcasts/">wherever you get your podcasts</a>". This is why the rapid adoption of MCP represents something of a second coming of the ethos of Web 2.0. Maybe we can call it Web 2.0 2.0.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that the current usage of "Web 2.0" is often wrong; people often use Web 2.0 as a term to describe things like Facebook. This is incorrect — closed, proprietary, user-hostile sites like Facebook are what <em>killed</em> Web 2.0. The Web 2.0 community was a bunch of folks building lots of different sites that were meant to have open APIs that let developers (and even users!) explore and connect people and data together in interesting and unexpected and useful and even <em>weird</em> ways. The standard-bearers of the era were sites like Flickr and Del.icio.us and Upcoming, which pioneered things like tags and social sharing. (I got a front row seat to a lot of the open standards work around APIs and protocols through working with the teams that built platforms like LiveJournal and Movable Type, which helped invent a lot of that stuff, too.)</p>
<p>The shared values of the Web 2.0 community was that you built your tools, technology, and platforms around open data and open protocols, with the expectation that users would be in control and that developers would have consistent, interoperable tools for interacting with these systems. At a practical level, this meant that I spent countless hours in meetings or in email conversations with people who were ostensibly my competitors, working through the technical details of how to make sure the products my team was building worked in the same ways that our competitors' did when developers were trying to write code to control them. We were all constantly writing specifications and documentation and sample code to describe how it all worked, and then writing big long blog posts fighting about how it <em>should</em> work.</p>
<h2>Bringing Open Back</h2>
<p>It's been a full generation since there was an expectation of interoperability between different apps and platforms that developers were using. While we had been so hopeful, the big VCs and tech industry leaders who are in charge now conspired to kill off that era of openness. For example. years ago, I'd helped build a tool that let you analyze your activity on social networks, and the people in charge of the platforms at the big social networks (some of whom are the same folks who are running the platforms at the big AI companies today!) made the decision to shut off the APIs that our product, and our users, relied upon. It killed our service, and our company. The Facebooks and Twitters of the world killed the Web 2.0 dream of open data and interoperable technologies for <em>lots</em> of people, and users lost out. All kinds of stupid situations became routine, like not being able to see an embedded Instagram photo on a Twitter timeline, let alone being able to do powerful things that people on the fediverse or Bluesky take for granted, like being able to import or export your followers, or being able to control your network with whatever app you want.</p>
<p>The rise of MCP gives hope that the popularity of AI amongst coders might pry open all these other platforms to make them programmable for <em>any</em> purpose, not just so that LLMs can control them.</p>
<p>It's cool that other platforms adopted the same spec that Anthropic made for their system. There's a generosity of spirit to a technology platform choosing to be the second to adopt a protocol, if they do it in a faithful fashion. The temptation is to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish">embrace and extend</a> (and eventually, extinguish) the platform that you're copying the protocol from. But if, instead, you act in good faith to say "we're going to make it easier for everybody, simply by using the same interface that this other company did, in hopes of making the whole ecosystem work a little bit better". Well, that's when the magic can happen.</p>
<p>This challenge of <em>just supporting the standard thing</em> is harder than it seems. A while back, when we launched <a href="https://www.fastly.com/products/ai">a semantic caching product</a> for popular AI platforms, one of the hardest things to convince our super genius developers to do was to just... use the regular ChatGPT API. "But we can make it <em>better</em>!" they'll say. Developers always say that. But better is <em>worse</em>. <em>Anything</em> that's different is worse. Stop being smarter and more clever, and stop cleaning up that horrible spec that is riddled with inconsistencies, and just ship the same shit as everybody else. You know what was a garbage spec that was missing all kinds of stuff? HTML! And yet here we are, on the wonderful world wide web. The whole internet sits atop a bunch of terrible specs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle">Jon Postel</a> smiles upon us all.</p>
<h2>Demand Conformance</h2>
<p>Now that a new generation of developers has had a taste of the wonderful explosion in creativity and possibility that comes from all their favorite tools and platforms using the same protocols and formats, they're going to get hooked on it. It's another one of the reasons that I've been feeling kind of like <a href="https://www.anildash.com/2024/10/15/its-2004-again/">we're getting 2004 vibes again</a>, mostly in a good way.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to have that experience in the early days of the social web and during the rise of Web 2.0, between the ascendance of RSS and podcasting, and open formats like OpenID and OAuth and the attempts at creating OpenSocial, which bore fruit many years later as fediverse and ActivityPub. There were countless other efforts that were less successful, or that were more prosaic or that only mattered for things like appeasing Google, but some of them... actually put power in people's hands. Once you've seen it happen, you kind of get hooked on it. You realize that technology, and the Internet, were not actually meant to exclusively be the playthings of a few giant companies, and a few depraved billionaire tycoons.</p>
<p>Developers, coders, nerds, even regular users — we have power. We can demand that the platforms we use give us access to control our experiences using code. We should go even further, and push for transparency about what these platforms are <em>doing</em> when we access them using open standards like MCP. As flexible as the Model Context Protocol is, it's still a totally opaque system when it comes to what a platform is doing with your data, or what actions might happen when you interact via MCP. The security risks are enormously high, and the protocol does little more than hand-wave at those concerns, suggesting that implementers ought to buckle their seatbelts because the vehicle might explode later on. If history is any indication, that stuff won't get fixed until there are some really egregious violations that get a ton of bad press.</p>
<h2>Maybe Could Prosper</h2>
<p>I'm not a total Pollyanna about the return of Web 2.0-style openness. MCP is not a panacea that's going to fix everything that's wrong about the developer ecosystem. And it certainly doesn't fix all the bullshit and hype that's distorting the conversation around AI, or provide the <a href="https://www.anildash.com/2025/05/01/what-would-good-ai-look-like/">better criticism about AI</a> that's sorely lacking in cultural discourse right now.</p>
<p>There is a chance, though, that younger developers, and those who weren't around to build back during that last era a generation ago, are going to get inspired by MCP to push for the web to go back towards its <em>natural</em> architecture. It was never meant to be proprietary. It was never meant to be controlled by a handful of dudes at a tiny number of giant companies. It was always meant to be programmable through janky specs that everybody hurriedly adopted just for the sheer joy of something fun to hack on. That was true long before the web had any version numbers at all.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/adforpostgresql/announcing-a-new-ide-for-postgresql-in-vs-code-from-microsoft/4414648">https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/adforpostgresql/announcing-a-new-ide-for-postgresql-in-vs-code-from-microsoft/4414648</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44073588">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We are excited to announce the public preview of the brand-new PostgreSQL extension for Visual Studio Code (VS Code), designed to simplify PostgreSQL database management and development workflows. With this extension, you can now manage database objects, draft queries with intelligent assistance from context-aware IntelliSense and our ‘@pgsql’ GitHub Copilot agent—all without ever leaving your favorite code editor.</p>

<p>Many of you face hurdles in managing time effectively, with 41% of developers struggling with task-switching, according to the <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">2024 StackOverflow Developer Survey</a>. Additionally, the <a href="https://stripe.com/files/reports/the-developer-coefficient.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">2024 Stripe Developer Coefficient Report</a> reveals that developers spend up to 50% of their time debugging and troubleshooting code and databases. These inefficiencies are further compounded by the absence of integrated tools that unify database management and application development.</p>
<p>The PostgreSQL extension for VS Code addresses these challenges head-on by integrating Postgres database tools and the @pgsql GitHub Copilot agent, providing a unified application development and database management experience. By integrating robust features such as Entra ID authentication for centralized identity management and deep Azure Database for PostgreSQL integration, this extension empowers you to focus on building innovative applications rather than wrestling with fragmented workflows.</p>

<p>The public preview release of the PostgreSQL extension for VS Code introduces a suite of powerful new capabilities that enhance productivity and streamline development for application developers working with Postgres.</p>

<p>Schema visualization is a breeze with our ‘right-click’ context menu options.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click on the database entry in the Object Explorer and select “Visualize Schema”</p>

<p><span data-image-alt=""><span id="hvMjHN_caption">Figure 1: Right-click on the database entry in the Object Explorer and select “Visualize Schema”<br>Single click to expand.<br></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>AI assistance directly within VS Code providing PostgreSQL database context reduces the PostgreSQL learning curve and improves developer productivity​.</li>
<li>Simplified interaction with PostgreSQL databases and development tools using natural language.</li>
<li>Commands such as "@pgsql" enable you to query databases, optimize schemas, and execute SQL operations with ease.</li>
<li>Context menus, such as “Rewrite Query”, “Explain Query”, “Analyze Query Performance” provide AI Intelligence inside the query editor window.</li>
<li>Real-time, expert-level guidance to help keep PostgreSQL databases performant and secure and improve code quality​.</li>
</ul>

<p><span data-image-alt=""><span id="bBmUvl_caption">Figure 3: PostgreSQL Copilot Explain Query Context Menu in action.<br>Single click to expand.<br></span></span></p>
<p>GitHub Copilot Chat agent mode provides a database context aware intelligent assistant that can perform multi-stage tasks, moving beyond the question-and-answer chat experience. Agent mode allows the Copilot to bring in additional context from your workspace and, with permission, it can write and debug code on its own. Agent mode transforms PostgreSQL development by providing real-time, AI-driven guidance that simplifies complex tasks like app prototyping, debugging, schema optimization, and performance tuning. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In this example, we’ll ask the agent to create a new database on a specific server in my Saved Connections and enable the PostGIS extension.</p>
<p><span data-image-alt=""><span id="yaGWdg_caption">Figure 4: Using the @pgsql GitHub Copilot Chat in agent mode to create a new database from a natural language prompt.<br>Single click to expand.</span></span></p><p>The @pgsql agent begins by listing the server connections, connecting to the server ‘postgis’, drafts the script to modify the database and waits for permission to continue before making changes. Database modifications require explicit permission from the user.</p>

<ul>
<li>Simplified connection management for local and cloud-hosted PostgreSQL instances.</li>
<li>Support for multiple connection profiles and connection string parsing for easy setup.</li>
<li>Direct browsing and filtering of Azure Database for PostgreSQL deployments.</li>

        <p>
            <i>
                <time datetime="2025-05-23T14:02Z">

        </p>
    

    <p>How many molecules from Caesar’s last breath do we inhale with each breath we take? Shockingly, the answer is about one molecule—we actually <em>do</em> share breaths with Caesar! And, by extension, <em>every breath</em> we take is composed of the previous breaths of <em>everyone who ever lived</em>—Socrates, Lincoln, Einstein, etc. Isn’t that crazy?</p>
<p>This is a classic exercise in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem">Fermi estimation</a>—it even has a <a href="https://samkean.com/books/caesars-last-breath/">book</a> named after it. It’s a beautiful introduction to the power of napkin math, showing how much you can figure out with just a few back-of-the-envelope numbers.</p>
<p>Estimating quantities is a valuable skill—if you’re not convinced, check out <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/nabeelqu/p/advice?r=hheyu&amp;selection=f0b1192c-03c6-4fc0-97a8-39476c2b3157&amp;utm_campaign=post-share-selection&amp;utm_medium=web">Nabeel Qureshi's blog</a>. It’s easier and more fun than it seems, and I find myself enjoying it more as I realize how often I land within an order of magnitude.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through Caesar’s Last Breath together!</p>
<p>We need to determine</p>
<ol>
<li>the volume of Earth’s atmosphere, and</li>
<li>the volume of a breath.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we assume that a breath diffuses evenly throughout the atmosphere and that these molecules are preserved over time (a reasonable assumption—nitrogen is relatively inert), then we can take</p>
<p><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><mtext>fraction</mtext><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><mtext>volume&nbsp;breath</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>volume&nbsp;atmosphere</mtext></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math></p>
<p>to find what fraction of Earth’s atmosphere is composed of Caesar’s last breath, and then multiply that by the number of molecules in a breath to get our answer (composition of atmosphere = composition of breath).</p>
<p>Here are a few “anchor” values:</p>
<ul>
<li>Earth’s radius is ≈ 6400 km = 6.4×10^6 m</li>
<li>The dense part of the atmosphere is ≈ 10 km “tall” = 10^4 m</li>
<li>The atmosphere is mostly O₂ and N₂, both ≈ 30 g/mol (1 mol ≈ 6×10^23 molecules)</li>
<li>Atmospheric density is ≈ 1 kg/m³</li>
<li><strong>For more “anchor” numbers to fuel your Fermi estimates, click <a href="https://www.mkodama.org/content/landmark-numbers/">here</a></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Finding some of these values is itself a Fermi estimation—you might know that Mt Everest is about 10 km high or that planes cruise at that altitude and use it as an estimate for the atmosphere’s thickness. Even better, apply the <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/284769/estimating-with-the-geometric-mean">geometric-mean trick</a>: if the atmosphere definitely extends more than 1 km but probably less than 100 km, guess <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><mrow><msqrt><mrow><mn>1</mn><mi>×</mi><msup><mn>10</mn><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup></mrow></msqrt><mo>=</mo><mn>10</mn></mrow></math> km—that’s the right order of magnitude.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post_message_11450527">
						
						<p><span>A carrier which is very rarely mentioned on here, I�m going to give you an insight into what it is like to work for them under one of those famous expat contracts that have floated about here and there in the past. I understand 99% of you will see the advert and simply move on, perhaps with an amused exhale while you scroll down to the flag carrier DEC jobs, but for the 1% of you looking for answers, here you go! </span></p><p>

<span>I�ll start from the beginning:</span></p><p>

<span><u><b>Background</b></u>:</span><br>
<span>So, you made some silly choices in your aviation career, and have found yourself fallen into the contractor bubble, jumping between contracts with various contractors. You don�t see your family as often as you�d like, and it�s far from stable, but the money is great and there is a large variety of flying. </span></p><p>

<span>Your previous contract blew up after just a few weeks and you find yourself now unemployed, bills to pay and a family to look after, when by miracle, a contractor rolls across your path offering a starting-6 month contracting role with Yemenia, LHS of the 320, a high roller 6 figure salary, accommodation, a joining bonus, and all the addons one might expect from this sort of contract. You know that when things seem too good to be true, they usually are, but hindsight is always 20/20, and you reassure yourself at the time that it is a reputable contractor, so don�t think twice about it. </span></p><p>

<span><u><b>Application</b></u>:</span><br>
<span>You throw in a fairly straightforward application, not really expecting to hear back. As with all of these types of contracts, they often die out before they start, and the ones that do get up and running with high salaries are often competitive, so you don�t expect to hear anything back. A few weeks pass, and you�re invited to a few unsociably timed zoom interviews which take place with cameras off and audio that sounds like a 2007 era Call of Duty microphone. The interview process was inexplicably easy, with questions more evolving toward �when can you start� than anything more bus or career specific. Red flags, but it�s all good, you�ve crossed these bridges before when you joined other random carriers in the past and they turned out OK. Eventually they contact you and send you flight details for a trip to Cairo to complete an assessment, no say in the dates, they�ve already made the bookings. Your journey to Cairo involves 2 stops via Frankfurt and Istanbul on an Economy Basic ticket, not exactly an Emirates Suite, but you are grateful that they pick up the tab. They whisk you into the Sofitel Cairo with a blank cheque to drown your sorrows, and where you can socialize with the other 7 expats here for the job, 2 Americans, a Brit, and a handful of continental Europeans, a few faces you�ve seen before too which is always reassuring. </span></p><p>

<span>The sim follows the usual rigmarole, and everybody passes with flying colours, in part due to the Egyption �assessor� not paying attention for 90% of it. A tick in the box, a shake of the hand and you�re sent packing back to Europe with nothing but a verbal promise of being contacted. A few weeks pass by, and eventually you are contacted once again, this time offering you a training start date in just a matter of days, once again taking place in Cairo. Alongside this wonderful news, they will essentially ask you to share a generations worth of info with them, from your stamped logbook pages, to bank statements. Odd, but what do you know. Still no word on signing a contract though, so you hope that will be completed in training, and head on your merry way.</span></p><p>

<span><u><b>Training</b></u>:</span><br>
<span>You kiss the wife and kids goodbye and tell them you�ll see them when you�re back from Yemen in 6 months time. Painful, but it�ll be worth it when you come back with pockets full of cash eh? </span></p><p>

<span>Not best pleased, at least the better half knows you�ll not get up to any funny business in that part of the world. </span></p><p>

<span>So you arrive in Cairo, alongside the other 7 expats who managed to navigate the gruelling selection process and sim assessment, and tuck into a few weeks of training. </span></p><p>

<span>Now, you are reminded of the fatal Yemenia Flight 626 crash back in �09, where the investigation blamed poor crew training, inappropriate actions, and training programmes �riddled with gaps and flaws� for the loss of 152 souls, and reassure yourself that they will have modified their training appropriately.</span></p><p>

<span>Ha! </span></p><p>

<span>What I can only describe as a serious box ticking exercise, interspersed with Death by Powerpoint in what I can only assume was English that had been smashed through Google Translate 6 or 7 times before being released. A few courses that should have been completed at the Yemenia Training Centre in Sana�a are completed virtually due to security reasons, and eventually you finish the course having learned next to nothing, in fact you are convinced you have left with less knowledge than you arrived with, you get some shiny gold wings stamped to your chest, and sent packing to the ancient city of Aden, your new home for the next 6 months. Contract remains non-existent. </span></p><p>

<span><u><b>Relocating</b></u>:</span><br>
<span>Now the fun begins. </span></p><p>

<span>As we haven�t signed contracts yet, we cannot be loaded onto a GENDEC or be provided with company tickets, so they ask you to purchase your own ticket to Aden and it will be reimbursed in your first salary. Oh well, seems like bs but you�ve got this far, how much could it hurt. </span></p><p>

<span>So $130USD later, you find yourself sitting on the 2R Cabin Crew jumpseat of an overbooked 17 year old A320, the inop APU means you are really getting a sweat on in your fancy new uniform which you were forced to wear during the unexplained 5 hour ground delay, and the all male cabin crew who refuse to acknowledge you prefer to smoke Camels in the back galley than do anything productive, thus adding to the already wonderful ambiance. </span></p><p>

<span>Overbooked you say? Wow, they must be doing quite well! No, there are 45 seats with INOP taped on them. No explanation though. </span></p><p>

<span>You peer into the open flight deck to say hello and try to get an understanding on the delay, but the local crew don�t acknowledge you and continue to dab out their cigarette ends into a Coke can jammed in front of the engine master switches. Oh well, must be a bad crew today. </span></p><p>

<span>Eventually though, you land in the historic city of Aden a few hours later than expected. </span></p><p>

<span>Now, Yemen is a country that nearly ALL countries advise against travel too, hell, even the Taliban recommend Afghan nationals don�t travel to Yemen right now. Oh well, the armoured G Wagon that will pick you up from the airport will keep you safe. </span></p><p>

<span>Ha! </span></p><p>

<span>They don�t provide transport, only for duties, so you hail a local 1980�s Toyota Landcruiser and the driver fleeces you for $50USD to drive you 15 minutes to your luxury accommodation. The technology of SAP Concur hasn�t reached these parts yet, so you convince yourself that you�ll talk to somebody in the office about claiming it back.</span></p><p>

<span>You arrive at the accommodation and realise the ##### sandwich you�ve got yourself into. </span></p><p>

<span>Oh and by the way, you�ve still not signed a contract, so as far as anybody is concerned you�re just a random bloke going for a jolly to a war zone. Nothing like a bit of war tourism to boost the local economy. </span></p><p>

<span><u><b>Accommodation</b></u>:</span><br>
<i>�<span>Luxury accommodation, with fully functioning Air Conditioning, a pool, plentiful local attractions and amenities, and 24/7 Private Military Contractors providing security for your safety�. </span></i></p><p>

<span>Now you see they are really playing fast and loose on the word luxury. 10 expats now reside in this 10 room compound out in the middle of nowhere to the NW of the city. High walls and a single gate for entry, it looks like something out of Ross Kemps ventures into Helmand Province. </span></p><p>

<span>But oh well, you crack on anyway, and you�re shown to your room by the first Yemenia rep you�ve met throughout this whole process. Your room consists of a very small single bed, with an old CRT Television propped on a wooden shelf and a mirror on the wall. A single square window with a net protects you from the elements. The washrooms are located in a separate building, as is the kitchen. There�s a single plug socket in the room which is used to power the TV, so you must decide between Yemeni MTV or charging your phone. The kitchen is at least well equipped, and is restocked 3 times per week with all kinds of western goods, like the fridge full of �Orange Mirinda� and �Shani�. There were even a few cans of Budweiser hidden in there, although whether these were officially provided, or sourced by a few of the more experienced expats, you�re not sure. </span></p><p>

<span>Copious amounts of bottled water were provided too, gratefully. </span></p><p>

<span>The washrooms were basic, a few cubicled bogs with a shared shower, alongside a couple of sinks to shave or have a wh*res wash in, very similar to something you�d find at some old relic summer camp. There is a pool, but it�s empty. You come to the conclusion that they didn�t lie, they never said it would be full of water, so they can have the benefit of the doubt on that one. </span></p><p>

<span>There were security guards too, but the term Private Military Contractors has you thinking of the high speed, low drag door kickers whose past lives had them on 22 SAS or one of the SEAL teams. That, they were not. They were the 2002 Manchester United shirt, jeans and flip flops with an AK47 slung over the shoulder kind of contractors. Oh well, they are there, sleeping and high on khat at the gate, but there nonetheless. </span></p><p>

<span>Now for those local attractions and amenities, you soon realise that the nearest civilisation is a petrol station, around 20 minutes walk away, or a 5 minutes drive. </span></p><p>

<span>Since you don�t have a car, your only way of getting anywhere is on foot, and given the dirty civil war waging sporadically in the region, you decide it�s best to forfeit your Chocolate Bar given the risk that you might end up in an orange jumpsuit on Al Jazeera just trying to get it. </span><br>
<span>Contracts:</span></p><p>

<span>After your guided tour of the Love Island villa, the Yemenia rep brings you into a room where he chucks a contract and a biro at you. Once again, the backwards English throws you off, but you see the numbers add up to what was promised and you sign. </span></p><p>

<span>Your 13,500 joining bonus is on the way mister captain. They don�t tell you that it�s 13500 Yemeni Rial, the equivalent of about $50USD though. </span></p><p>

<span>But at least the important figures, salary and duty pay, are clearly in $USD on the contract. </span></p><p>

<span>Oh well! Payday is on the 2nd of each month, so only a week left. </span></p><p>

<span><u><b>How Yemenia Works</b></u>:</span><br>
<span>So there is a 320 crew base in Aden, and one in Seiyun, in addition to a 330 skeleton crew based in Sana�a. </span></p><p>

<span>Aden is the largest base, and the only one with an expat community, this includes cabin crew who are drafted from places such as the Philippines, Venezuela, Ukraine, Cambodia, and other random parts of the world. </span></p><p>

<span>The head office of Yemenia is in the city of Sana�a, which is essentially off limits at the moment due to an escalation in the conflict. This includes the Operations Control Centre and all other relevant teams. In Seiyun there is no Yemenia hard presence, and in Aden there isn't either, but there is a ground team and a station manager. </span></p><p>

<span>The postal system is entirely unreliable in Yemen, so anything that needs to come from Sana�a is generally delivered in person, this includes stuff that could be sent by email because the internet here is also incredibly unreliable. Unfortunately, this does come with risks, one of the couriers had his car blown to bits by a Saudi drone a few weeks back. </span></p><p>

<span>Financially, the company is a bit of mess, nobody really knows where it sits, it hasn�t updated any technology for many centuries, ground staff often need to be negotiated with at outstations to get them to service the aircraft, but the airline say they want to buy some new Airbus�, so who knows. </span></p><p>

<span><b><u>Rostering</u></b>:</span><br>
<span>Like many airlines, Yemenia use one of the major rostering apps, and rosters release 15 days before the end of the month. Even despite the rocket attacks, car bombs, mortars, and intermittent electricity and wifi, they do still manage to get the roster out on time, which is more than I can say for the few European carriers I worked for. </span></p><p>

<span>For expats, the roster is 5/2/5/3, however with regular lengthy delays, you�ll often find yourself flying into your days off with no extra cash or days off in lieu offered. Flying is a mix of 2 and 4 sector days, rarely you�ll get a 3 sector with a stop in Seiyun, but more often than not it�ll be 2 sectors. Becoming AOG is a daily occurrence, but AOG nightstops </span><span>are not</span><span> a thing here, you�ll fly back to Aden regardless of duty hours completed, and you�ll be expected to give up your min rest on occasions where you return late. Your 2000 check out and 0800 report will often become a 2300 check out and an 0800 report because Crew Control/Ops don�t have the facilities to make changes. Sometimes, they won�t even know you�ve arrived, and you�ll be woken up at 0130 to a phone call from Ops asking if you�ve landed in Aden, a duty you completed at 1700. </span></p><p>

<span>Roster changes are regular, however, you don�t often actually see any changes because either Crew Control don�t have any internet or electricity to update your roster, or you�ve not got the internet to receive it. Given the situation in Sana�a, the OCC is generally unreliable, and so major flight info such as delays will often be sent by text from the Aden station manager. </span></p><p>

<span>There is no bidding system of course, and expats are strictly forbidden from flying with each other unless it�s for the purpose of line training. No no, we get to fly with the locals and the EagleJet p2f goons. Don�t get me wrong, some of the locals are really good at their jobs, especially some of the younger FOs who trained abroad, but they are more the exception than the rule. </span></p><p>

<span>If you need to call sick, you try Crew Control, but you�ll likely not get through, so you phone the Aden station manager and just arrange yourself with another pilot to take your place. </span></p><p>

<span><u><b>Aden</b></u>:</span><br>
<span>The safer of the 3 major cities in Yemen, Aden is still home to sporadic fighting. While currently �peaceful�, this isn�t the definition you would find in the West, it�s certainly peaceful compared to 2 years ago, but I wouldn�t say peaceful. The click-clacking of AKs and explosions can still be heard rolling across the city on some days. The city is riddled with checkpoints from various factions. To get to work, your driver takes you on a longer route so you pass only through police and military checkpoints where you�re essentially granted a free pass as you work for Yemenia. Other checkpoints especially heading North, or into the centre of town are less friendly, with different militias setting up their own, and as an employee of Yemenia, and therefore a representative of the Yemeni Government and a Yemeni flag flyer, you�ll quickly be hooded and scooped up for a fun interrogation. Like most towns in these parts of the world, 80% of the locals are lovely people who just want to get on with their lives, some of the older women will treat you as one of their own while you�re so far from home, but despite that there is still a very present and serious danger if you decide to venture out without protection. The airport, the port and Little Aden and At-Tawah which guard the mouth to the port have a heavy military presence which seems, recently, to be working. If you�re in uniform, the police and military will leave you alone, sometimes even escort you where you need to go, if you�re out of uniform, expect some potentially heavy handed questioning. </span></p><p>

<span>There are no consular services from any nation available in Yemen, Sana�a was once home to various embassies including the U.S. and U.K., but these are now closed and operate remotely from Djibouti. If you need consular support, you lose your passport or something, well, quite frankly, you�re f*cked. </span><br>
<span><u><b>Life outside of flying</b></u>:</span><br>
<span>There isn�t much of one. You can�t really venture out of the compound so you find the best spot in the compound for wifi, crack open a few beers and sit in the 40 degree sun doing nothing for 3 days. Sounds good, and it is at first, but the novelty soon wears off. The expat cabin crew compound is about 25 minutes away and they regularly find their way here, since we have the cold amber nectar they desire. </span></p><p>

<span>Some people try and get home for their 3 days off but it is seemingly next to impossible, largely because trying to get on flights out of Aden is like trying to get blood out of a stone, and if you manage, it�ll cost you an arm and a leg. There�s no ID90 around here, just crisp USD that must be dished out to multiple people before you get your ass on a crew jumpseat. Some days you might get lucky, if it�s an expat captain, we all have a gentleman�s agreement that we will let fellow expats jumpseat in the flight deck if they�re on their way to/from home to save any hassle. There�s only way out of Aden for most, and that�s to take a company flight to Cairo and travel onwards from there, alternatively you can fly into Jeddah and go onward from there, but factor in a few extra hours into your connection for a very uncomfortable interrogation in a bright white room about your time in Yemen. Royal Jordanian previously operated an E190 down here but it stopped due to security reasons. Be aware, everytime you leave Yemen, you�ll need an �exit visa�, this is relatively straightforward to obtain though, if you carry your Yemenia ID with you, if all else fails, the Aden station manager will sort you out. While straight forward, it can be a painstakingly long process lasting a few hours sometimes, so consider this before making your way to the airport.</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article_content_panel">
		<article>
         	<p>At the <a href="https://2025.pgconf.dev/">PGConf.dev 2025</a> Global Developer Conference, <a href="https://bohanzhang.me/#talks">Bohan Zhang</a> from OpenAI shared OpenAI’s best practices with PostgreSQL, offering a glimpse into the database usage of one of the most prominent unicorn companies.</p>
<blockquote>At OpenAI, we utilize an unsharded architecture with one writer and multiple readers, demonstrating that PostgreSQL can scale gracefully under massive read loads.<br>— PGConf.dev 2025, Bohan Zhang from OpenAI</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://www.pixelstech.net/article/images/introduction.png" alt="introduction.png"></p>
<p>Bohan Zhang is a member of OpenAI’s Infrastructure team. He studied under Professor <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/">Andy Pavlo</a> at Carnegie Mellon University and co-founded <a href="https://ottertune.com/">OtterTune</a> with him.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>PostgreSQL serves as the core database supporting the majority of OpenAI’s critical systems. If PostgreSQL experiences downtime, many of OpenAI’s key services would be directly affected. There have been several instances in the past where issues related to PostgreSQL have led to outages of ChatGPT.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pixelstech.net/article/images/background.png" alt="background.png"></p>
<p>OpenAI utilizes managed databases on Azure, employing a classic PostgreSQL primary-replica replication architecture without sharding. This setup consists of one primary database and over forty replicas. For a service like OpenAI, which boasts 500 million active users, scalability is a significant concern.</p>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>In OpenAI’s primary-replica PostgreSQL architecture, read scalability is excellent. However, “write requests” have become a major bottleneck. OpenAI has implemented numerous optimizations in this area, such as offloading write loads wherever possible and avoiding the addition of new services to the primary database.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pixelstech.net/article/images/challenges.png" alt="challenges.png"></p>
<p>PostgreSQL’s Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) design presents some known issues, including table and index bloat. Tuning automatic garbage collection (vacuuming) can be complex, as each write operation generates a complete new version, and index access may require additional visibility checks. These design aspects pose challenges when scaling read replicas: for example, increased Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) can lead to greater replication lag, and as the number of replicas grows significantly, network bandwidth may become a new bottleneck.</p>
<h3>Measures</h3>
<p>To address these issues, we have undertaken efforts on multiple fronts:</p>
<h4>Controlling Primary Database Load</h4>
<p>The first optimization involves smoothing out write spikes on the primary database to minimize its load. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offloading all possible write operations.</li>
<li>Avoiding unnecessary writes at the application level.</li>
<li>Using lazy writes to smooth out write bursts.</li>
<li>Controlling the frequency during data backfilling.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, OpenAI strives to offload as many read requests as possible to replicas. For read requests that cannot be removed from the primary database due to being part of read-write transactions, high efficiency is required.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pixelstech.net/article/images/control-loading.png" alt="control-loading.png"></p>
<h4>Query Optimization</h4>
<p>The second optimization focuses on the query layer. Since long transactions can hinder garbage collection and consume resources, timeouts are configured to avoid long “Idle in Transaction” sessions, with timeouts set at the session, statement, and client levels. Furthermore, complex multi-join queries (e.g., joining 12 tables at once) have been optimized. The presentation also specifically mentioned that using ORM can easily lead to inefficient queries and should be used cautiously.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pixelstech.net/article/images/query_optimization.png" alt="query_optimization.png"></p>
<h4>Addressing Single Points of Failure</h4>
<p>The primary database is a single point of failure; if it goes down, write operations cannot proceed. In contrast, we have many read-only replicas; if one fails, applications can still read from others. In fact, many critical requests are read-only, so even if the primary database fails, they can continue to read from it.</p>
<p>Moreover, we differentiate between low-priority and high-priority requests. For high-priority requests, OpenAI allocates dedicated read-only replicas to prevent them from being affected by low-priority requests.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pixelstech.net/article/images/single_point_failure.png" alt="single_point_failure.png"></p>
<h4>Schema Management</h4>
<p>The fourth measure is to only allow lightweight schema changes on this cluster. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating new tables or introducing new workloads is not permitted.</li>
<li>Adding or removing columns is allowed (with a 5-second timeout), but any operation requiring a full table rewrite is not allowed.</li>
<li>Creating or removing indexes is permitted but must use the CONCURRENTLY option.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another issue mentioned is that long-running queries (&gt;1s) during operation can continuously block schema changes, ultimately causing them to fail. The solution is to have the application optimize or offload these slow queries.</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<ul>
<li>Scaled Azure-hosted PostgreSQL to handle over one million QPS (combined read and write) across the entire cluster, supporting OpenAI’s critical services.</li>
<li>Added dozens of replicas (approximately 40) without increasing replication lag.</li>
<li>Deployed read-only replicas across different geographic regions while maintaining low latency.</li>
<li>Experienced only one PostgreSQL-related SEV0 incident in the past nine months.</li>
<li>Reserved ample capacity for future growth.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Incident Cases</h3>
<p>OpenAI also shared several case studies of issues encountered:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first case involved a cache failure leading to a cascading effect. <br><img src="https://www.pixelstech.net/article/images/1st-incident.png" alt="1st-incident.png"></li>
<li>
<p>The second incident was particularly interesting: under extremely high CPU usage, a bug was triggered where, even after CPU levels normalized, the WALSender process continued spinning in a loop instead of properly sending WAL logs to replicas, resulting in increased replication lag.<br><img src="https://www.pixelstech.net/article/images/2nd-incident.png" alt="2nd-incident.png"></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Feature Requests</h3>
<p>Finally, Bohan presented several issues and feature requests to the PostgreSQL developer community:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Regarding index management: unused indexes can lead to write amplification and additional maintenance overhead. OpenAI wishes to remove unnecessary indexes but, to minimize risk, they propose a “Disable” feature for indexes. This would allow monitoring performance metrics to ensure stability before permanently dropping the index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On observability: currently, <code>pg_stat_statements</code> provides only average response times per query type, lacking direct access to p95 and p99 latency metrics. They hope for more metrics akin to histograms and percentile latencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Concerning schema changes: they desire PostgreSQL to record a history of schema change events, such as adding or removing columns and other DDL operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitoring view semantics: they observed a session with <code>state = Active</code> and <code>wait_event = ClientRead</code> persisting for over two hours. This indicates a connection remained active for an extended period post-QueryStart, and such connections cannot be terminated by <code>idle_in_transaction</code> timeouts. They seek to understand if this is a bug and how to address it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lastly, they suggest optimizing PostgreSQL’s default parameters, noting that the current default values are overly conservative. They inquire whether better defaults or heuristic-based settings could be implemented.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Lao Feng’s Comments</h3>
<p>Although PGConf.Dev 2025 primarily focuses on development, there are often user-side use case shares as well—like OpenAI’s scalability practices with PostgreSQL. Topics like this are actually quite interesting to core developers, since many of them have no concept of how PostgreSQL is used in extreme real-world scenarios.</p>
<p>Since the end of 2017, Lao Feng managed dozens of PostgreSQL clusters at Tantan, which was one of the largest and most complex deployments in China’s internet sector at the time: dozens of PostgreSQL clusters handling around 2.5 million QPS. Back then, their largest core cluster used a master with 33 replicas and carried around 400,000 QPS. The bottleneck was also on single-node write performance, which they eventually addressed through database and table sharding on the application side.</p>
<p>You could say that the issues encountered and the solutions applied in OpenAI’s talk were all things they’ve dealt with before. Of course, what’s different now is that today’s top-tier hardware is way more powerful than it was eight years ago. That allows a startup like OpenAI to use a single PostgreSQL cluster—without sharding or partitioning—to serve their entire business. This undoubtedly serves as another strong piece of evidence for the idea that “distributed databases are a false need.”</p>
<p>OpenAI uses managed PostgreSQL on Azure, with top-tier server specs. The number of replicas reaches over 40, including some cross-region replicas. This massive cluster handles around 1 million QPS (read + write) in total. They use Datadog for monitoring, and their services access the RDS cluster through application-side PgBouncer connection pooling from within Kubernetes.</p>
<p>Since OpenAI is a strategic-level customer, the Azure PostgreSQL team provides very hands-on support. But clearly, even with top-tier cloud database services, users still need strong awareness and capabilities on the application and operations side. Even with the brainpower of OpenAI, they still run into pitfalls in PostgreSQL operations in practice.</p>
<p>High availability wasn’t discussed in this talk, so we can assume that’s handled by Azure PostgreSQL RDS. Meanwhile, monitoring is critical for system ops. OpenAI uses Datadog to monitor PostgreSQL—and even with OpenAI’s financial resources, they still feel that Datadog is ridiculously expensive.</p>
<p>After the conference, during the evening social event, Lao Feng had a long chat into the early hours with Bohan and two other database founders. The private conversation was very engaging, though Lao Feng couldn’t reveal more details—haha.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pixelstech.net/article/images/social.png" alt="social.png"></p>
<h3>Lao Feng Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>Regarding the issues and feature requests raised by Bohan, Lao Feng offers some answers here. In fact, most of the functionality OpenAI is looking for already exists within the PostgreSQL ecosystem—it just might not be available in the core PostgreSQL or on Azure RDS.</p>
<h4>On Disabling Indexes</h4>
<p>PostgreSQL actually does have a feature to disable indexes. You can simply set the indisvalid field to false in the pg_index system catalog. This makes the planner ignore the index, although it will still be maintained during DML operations. From a technical standpoint, this is totally fine—this is the same mechanism used during concurrent index creation via the isready and isvalid flags. It’s not black magic.</p>
<p>That said, it’s understandable why OpenAI can’t use this method—RDS doesn’t grant superuser permissions, so you can’t modify system catalogs directly to achieve this.</p>
<p>But going back to the original goal—avoiding accidental deletion of indexes—there’s a simpler solution: just confirm via monitoring views that the index is not being used on either primary or replicas. If it hasn’t been accessed for a long time, it’s safe to delete.</p>
<p>Using the Pigsty monitoring system, you can observe the process of live index switching for PGSQL tables.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pixelstech.net/article/images/monitoring.png" alt="monitoring.png"></p>
<pre><code>CREATE UNIQUE INDEX CONCURRENTLY pgbench_accounts_pkey2
ON pgbench_accounts USING BTREE(aid);

-- Mark the original index as invalid (won’t be used) but still maintained
UPDATE pg_index SET indisvalid = false
WHERE indexrelid = 'pgbench_accounts_pkey'::regclass;</code></pre>
<h4>On Observability</h4>
<p>pg_stat_statements likely won’t provide P95 or P99 percentile metrics anytime soon, as this would drastically increase the memory footprint of the extension—maybe dozens of times. While modern servers could handle it, extremely conservative environments might not. I asked the maintainer of pg_stat_statements about this and it’s unlikely to happen. I also asked Jelte, the maintainer of pgbouncer, and such functionality is also unlikely in the short term.</p>
<p>But the issue can be addressed. First, the pg_stat_monitor extension does provide detailed percentile latency (RT) metrics and would certainly work, though you’ll need to consider the performance overhead of collecting such metrics. A second option is using eBPF to passively collect RT metrics, and of course, the simplest way is to add query latency monitoring directly in the application’s data access layer (DAL).</p>
<p>The most elegant solution might be eBPF-based side-channel collection, but since they’re using Azure’s managed PostgreSQL without server access, this option is probably off the table.</p>
<h4>On Schema Change History</h4>
<p>Actually, PostgreSQL logs already offer this capability—just set log_statement to ddl (or more verbosely, mod or all), and all DDL statements will be logged. The pgaudit extension provides similar capabilities.</p>
<p>But I suspect what they really want is not logs, but a system view that can be queried via SQL. In that case, another option is to use CREATE EVENT TRIGGER to log DDL events directly into a data table. The pg_ddl_historization extension provides a much easier way to do this, and I’ve already compiled and packaged this extension.</p>
<p>However, creating event triggers also requires superuser privileges. AWS RDS has some special handling that makes this possible, but Azure’s PostgreSQL doesn’t seem to support it.</p>
<h4>On the Semantics of Monitoring Views</h4>
<p>In OpenAI’s example, State = Active means the backend process is still within the lifecycle of a single SQL statement—it hasn’t sent a ReadyForQuery message to the frontend yet, so PostgreSQL still considers the statement “not yet finished.” As a result, resources like row locks, buffer pins, snapshots, and file handles are still considered “in use.” WaitEvent = ClientRead means the process is waiting for input from the client. When both appear together, a typical case is an idle COPY FROM STDIN, but it could also be due to TCP blocking or being stuck between BIND and EXECUTE. So it’s hard to say definitively whether it’s a bug—it depends on what the connection is actually doing.</p>
<p>Some might argue that waiting for client I/O should count as “idle” from a CPU perspective. But State tracks the execution state of the statement, not whether the process is actively using the CPU. A query can be in the Active state while not running on CPU (when WaitEvent is NULL), or it can be looping on CPU waiting for client input (i.e., ClientRead).</p>
<p>Back to the core issue—there are ways to address it. For example, in Pigsty, when PostgreSQL is accessed via HAProxy, the primary service has a maximum connection lifespan (e.g., 24 hours) set at the load balancer level. In more stringent environments, this can be as short as one hour. This means connections exceeding the lifespan are terminated. Ideally, though, the client-side connection pool should proactively enforce connection lifetimes instead of being forcibly disconnected. For offline, read-only services, this timeout isn’t needed—allowing for long-running queries that may last for days. This approach provides a safety net for cases where a connection is Active but waiting on I/O.</p>
<p>That said, it’s unclear whether Azure PostgreSQL offers this kind of control.</p>
<h4>On Default Parameters</h4>
<p>PostgreSQL’s default parameters are extremely conservative. For example, it defaults to just 256 MB of memory (and can be set as low as 256 KB!). The upside is that PostgreSQL can start and run in virtually any environment. The downside? I’ve seen a production setup with 1 TB of physical memory still running with the default 256 MB configuration… (Thanks to double buffering, it actually ran for quite a while.)</p>
<p>Overall, I think conservative defaults aren’t a bad thing. This issue can be solved with more flexible dynamic configuration. Services like RDS and Pigsty offer well-designed heuristics for initial parameter tuning, which already solves this problem quite well. That said, this feature could still be built into PostgreSQL command-line tools—e.g., during initdb, the tool could auto-detect CPU, memory, disk size and type, and set sensible defaults accordingly.</p>
<h4>Self-Hosting?</h4>
<p>The real challenges in OpenAI’s setup don’t stem from PostgreSQL itself, but rather the limitations of using managed PostgreSQL on Azure. One solution would be to bypass those restrictions by using Azure or another cloud’s IaaS layer to deploy self-hosted PostgreSQL clusters on local NVMe SSD instances.</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://pigsty.io/">Pigsty</a> was built by Lao Feng specifically to address PostgreSQL challenges at this scale—it’s essentially a self-hosted RDS solution, and it scales well. Many of the problems OpenAI has encountered—or will encounter—already have solutions implemented in Pigsty, which is open-source and free.</p>
<p>If OpenAI is interested, I’d be happy to offer some help. That said, when a company is scaling as fast as they are, tweaking database infrastructure might not be a top priority. Fortunately, they’ve got some excellent PostgreSQL DBAs who can keep pushing forward and exploring these paths.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Foundation Models (FMs) have completely taken over unstructured data domains like natural language and images, delivering significant advances in performance across tasks with little to no task-specific training. Yet structured and semi-structured relational data, which represent some of the most valuable information assets, largely miss out on this AI wave. To use AI on relational data, practitioners still use conventional machine learning approaches and build per-task and per-dataset specific models that require significant development and tuning time.</p><p>We present <strong>KumoRFM</strong>, a <strong>Relational Foundation Model (RFM)</strong> capable of making accurate predictions over relational databases across a wide range of predictive tasks without requiring data or task-specific training. KumoRFM extends principles of in-context learning to the multi-table relational graph setting. The model employs a table-invariant encoding scheme and a novel Relational Graph Transformer to reason within arbitrary multi-modal data across tables.</p><p>Through extensive evaluation on the <a href="https://relbench.stanford.edu/">RelBench</a> benchmark, covering 30 predictive tasks across seven domains, we show that, on average, KumoRFM outperforms both the de-facto gold-standard of feature engineering as well as end-to-end supervised deep learning approaches by 2% to 8% across three different task types. When fine-tuned on a specific task, KumoRFM can improve its performance further by 10% to 30% on average. Most importantly, KumoRFM is orders of magnitude faster than conventional approaches that rely on supervised training.</p><h2 id="relational-foundation-models-(rfms)">Relational Foundation Models (RFMs)</h2><p>Relational data is typically stored as structured tables in data warehouses and represents entities such as user records, transaction histories, supply chain interactions, product catalogs, financial ledgers, and health records.

Such a model needs to effectively learn across complex database schemas with an arbitrary number of tables and columns and handle the inherent heterogeneity of column types, which often have divergent semantic meanings. Several open questions had to be addressed:</p><ul><li>What should a foundation model for relational data be capable of?</li><li>Can it generalize to new databases and tasks it has never been trained on?</li><li>Can it provide accurate predictions from a few in-context examples?</li><li>What architectural design is necessary to handle relational complexity?</li><li>What data is needed to train such a model effectively?</li></ul><h2 id="what-is-kumorfm">What is KumoRFM?</h2><p>KumoRFM is a foundation model built for predictive tasks on structured, relational data, and draws from two key research areas: representation learning over relational databases and the emerging field of foundation models for structured data.</p><p>KumoRFM accepts as input a query written in a domain-specific language called <a href="https://docs.kumo.ai/docs/predictive-query">Predictive Query Language (PQL)</a>, which is similar in syntax to SQL but focused on defining prediction problems rather than data manipulation operations.</p><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1804" height="742" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://kumo.ai/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3lh42f5%2Fproduction%2F89292ba8fd3fb9158044c6dcf6b02f23fa1bce4a-1804x742.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://kumo.ai/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3lh42f5%2Fproduction%2F89292ba8fd3fb9158044c6dcf6b02f23fa1bce4a-1804x742.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://kumo.ai/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3lh42f5%2Fproduction%2F89292ba8fd3fb9158044c6dcf6b02f23fa1bce4a-1804x742.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><p>Mapping from predictive queries to task types. The aggregation scheme and the semantic type of the target column uniquely determine the underlying machine learning task.</p></div><p>Each PQL query defines the target variable to predict, the set of entities for which predictions should be made, and any filters or aggregation functions (e.g., <code>FIRST</code>, <code>COUNT</code>, <code>SUM</code>, <code>LIST_DISTINCT</code>). Supported tasks include regression, binary classification, multi-class and multi-label classification, and link prediction. Once a query is submitted, KumoRFM retrieves relevant data from the underlying relational database and automatically generates context examples—labeled subgraphs that capture the relationships and historical patterns relevant to the prediction task. These are then used by the model to reason about the current query.</p><p>The system does not require task-specific training. Instead, it applies in-context learning at inference time by sampling from the historical data stored in the database. This allows it to handle new datasets or tasks without retraining the underlying model.</p><h3 id="kumorfm-under-the-hood:-architecture-and-design">KumoRFM Under the Hood: Architecture and Design</h3><p>KumoRFM operates on relational databases by internally converting them into temporal, heterogeneous graphs.

When fine-tuned, the model establishes new performance benchmarks on multiple classification, regression and recommendation tasks across e-commerce, social, medical, and sports domains. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of foundation models for predictive modeling on relational data.</p><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1636" height="793" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://kumo.ai/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3lh42f5%2Fproduction%2F9493be163d447330d1c46aa3d9eafe4c72821ae4-1636x793.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://kumo.ai/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3lh42f5%2Fproduction%2F9493be163d447330d1c46aa3d9eafe4c72821ae4-1636x793.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://kumo.ai/_next/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3lh42f5%2Fproduction%2F9493be163d447330d1c46aa3d9eafe4c72821ae4-1636x793.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><p>Time to first prediction in (a) hours of human labor and (b) lines of code (LoC),
illustrated on node-level classification tasks. KumoRFM is orders of magnitude faster (≈1 second vs. ≈30 minutes vs. ≈12.3 hours) and requires zero-code to get to accurate predictions (1 LoC vs. ≈56 LoC vs. ≈878 LoC) compared to Data Scientist and RDL baselines, respectively.</p></div><p>Most importantly, KumoRFM is orders of magnitude faster than conventional approaches that rely on supervised training, and provides a zero-code solution to query <em>any</em> entity and <em>any</em> target at <em>any</em> future point in time. These results highlight the core value proposition of a relational foundation model: enabling real-time predictions with minimal effort, paving the way for a new generation of predictive systems that can be stacked, queried, and operationalized to drive faster and smarter business decisions.</p><p><strong>To read more about KumoRFM, you can view the full whitepaper <a href="https://kumo.ai/research/kumo_relational_foundation_model.pdf">here</a>.</strong></p></div></div>]]></description>
