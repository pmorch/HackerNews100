<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>My tech posts often come from kind of a negative place. I wish it wasn‚Äôt like that, but we all know how the mind works: writing with nuance and positivity is a lot harder than fired-up screeds of the ‚Äúsomeone is wrong on the Internet‚Äù variety. I do try to check myself. I know that people come from all kinds of situations and codebases, everyone is doing their best given the conditions they‚Äôre in, and there really is no One True Way to write code. I will at least always try to give a good sense of how I‚Äôd prefer things be done instead, rather than just pointing at something and saying it‚Äôs bad.</p>

<p>But I think there‚Äôs another reason why I come across as negative or angry. And as always with these things it‚Äôs hard to tell if I‚Äôm just jaded and ossified from having spent my entire adult life touching keyboards, or if it has real merit: I feel like the web used to <em>work better</em>. Not in the sense of features or flagship sites‚Äîweb-based email clients and word processors and image editors are all waaay better than they used to be and I would say the high-quality stuff is of higher quality than ever. I‚Äôm not pining for the HTML-only version of GMail, I promise. But if I were to estimate some rough median of ‚Äúhow well do websites work‚Äù I would also say that there‚Äôs an <em>incredible</em> amount of jank out there. My father called me in exasperation last night after trying and failing to book a plane ticket. I find myself having to go over to their house and do things like switch browsers, open private windows, occasionally even open up the Web Inspector to fiddle with the markup, and I hate every second of it. I‚Äôve trained myself out of using the Back button and opening things in new windows, and I will often close and restart order flows rather than try to go back and edit something I messed up. And I just‚Ä¶ WHY. Why is it so hard?</p>

<p>Your web browser is an amazing piece of software. Give it an HTML page and it‚Äôll render and lay it out in milliseconds, and if you let it do what it wants to do (follow a link when it‚Äôs clicked, submit a form with a button, populate input fields, etc) it‚Äôll just <em>work like everyone expects it to</em>. I think that‚Äôs where most of my pathos comes from: I have a lived experience from the Before Times when things were just pages and forms, and it turns out pages and forms get you very, very far.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm a web developer, so I know that the number one cause of jank and breakage is another developer having messed with the browser‚Äôs default way of doing things. I can usually figure out what has been tampered with and work around it. But normal people can‚Äôt. They expect the Back button to work, and they expect that the stuff they filled out on the previous page will be there when they click it. And it would! <em>If you would just let the browser do what it wants to do!</em></p>

<p>I could absolutely write cheerier, more charitable and uplifting tech posts. Everything doesn‚Äôt have to be an aggressive ‚Äúdo better‚Äù response to something or someone. But I assure you those posts come from a place of genuine concern: much of the modern web makes me sad and I feel like I‚Äôm screaming into the wind. Every broken contact form or booking site is a <em>truly spectacular</em> own-goal. If your calendar was a bunch of progressively enhanced checkboxes and a submit button, you could be riding off into the sunset and counting money instead of taking support calls from frustrated octogenarians. And it‚Äôs hard for me to shut up about that.</p>

<p>I care. I really do. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm mad sometimes.</p>

<p dir="auto">LaVague is designed to automate menial tasks on behalf of its users. Many of these tasks are repetitive, time-consuming, and require little to no cognitive effort. By automating these tasks, LaVague aims to free up time for more meaningful endeavors, allowing users to focus on what truly matters to them.</p>
<p dir="auto">By providing an engine turning natural language queries into Selenium code, LaVague is designed to make it easy for users or other AIs to automate easily express web workflows and execute them on a browser.</p>
<p dir="auto">One of the key usages we see is to automate tasks that are personal to users and require them to be logged in, for instance automating the process of paying bills, filling out forms or pulling data from specific websites.</p>
<p dir="auto">LaVague is built on open-source projects and leverages open-sources models, either locally or remote, to ensure the transparency of the agent and ensures that it is aligned with users' interests.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">‚ú® Features</h2><a id="user-content--features" aria-label="Permalink: ‚ú® Features" href="#-features"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Natural Language Processing</strong>: Understands instructions in natural language to perform browser interactions.</li>
<li><strong>Selenium Integration</strong>: Seamlessly integrates with Selenium for automating web browsers.</li>
<li><strong>Open-Source</strong>: Built on open-source projects such as transformers and llama-index, and leverages open-source models, either locally or remote, to ensure the transparency of the agent and ensures that it is aligned with users' interests.</li>
<li><strong>Local models for privacy and control</strong>: Supports local models like <code>Gemma-7b</code> so that users can fully control their AI assistant and have privacy guarantees.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced AI techniques</strong>: Uses a local embedding (<code>bge-small-en-v1.5</code>) first to perform RAG to extract the most relevant HTML pieces to feed the LLM answering the query, as directly dropping the full HTML code would not fit in context. Then leverages Few-shot learning and Chain of Thought to elicit the most relevant Selenium code to perform the action without having to finetune the LLM (<code>Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO</code>) for code generation.</li>

<p dir="auto">This is an early project but could grow to democratize transparent and aligned AI models to undertake actions for the sake of users on the internet.</p>
<p dir="auto">We see the following key areas to explore:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Fine-tune local models like a <code>gemma-7b-it</code> to be expert in Text2Action</li>
<li>Improve retrieval to make sure only relevant pieces of code are used for code generation</li>
<li>Support other browser engines (playwright) or even other automation frameworks</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new industrial-scale 'sand battery' has been announced for Finland, which packs 1 MW of power and a capacity of up to 100 MWh of thermal energy for use during those cold polar winters. The new battery will be about 10 times bigger than a <a href="https://newatlas.com/energy/sand-battery-polar-night/" data-cms-ai="0">pilot plant</a> that‚Äôs been running since 2022.</p><p>The sand battery, developed by Polar Night Energy, is a clever concept. Basically, it‚Äôs a big steel silo of sand (or a similar solid material) that‚Äôs warmed up through a heat exchanger buried in the center, using excess electricity from the grid ‚Äì say, that generated during a spike from renewable sources, when it‚Äôs cheap.</p><p>That energy can then be stored for months at a time, with reportedly very little loss, before being extracted as heat on demand. This could theoretically be converted back into electricity, although with some energy loss. But Polar Night says that the most efficient method is to just use the heat itself.</p><p>In a chilly place like Finland, that means feeding it into the local district heating system, which shares heat produced from industry or energy production through the community. Networks of pipes carry this heat as hot water or steam to warm up houses, buildings, even swimming pools. In this case, the new sand battery would be trialed in the district heating system of the Finnish municipality of Pornainen, run by a company called Loviisan L√§mp√∂.</p><div data-align-center="">

That, the companies claim, equates to a week‚Äôs worth of Pornainen‚Äôs heat demands in winter, or a month‚Äôs worth in summer. By comparison, Polar Night‚Äôs previous sand battery stands 4 x 7 m (13 x 23 ft), for a nominal power rating of 100 kW and a capacity of 8 MWh.</p><p>The new battery should also reduce the carbon dioxide emissions of the district heating system by 160 tonnes per year, translating to an almost 70% reduction. The sand itself will also be sustainably sourced ‚Äì it‚Äôll consist of crushed soapstone, which is a manufacturing byproduct of another local industry. This material can apparently conduct heat even better than regular old sand.</p><p>While sand batteries might not find wide outside of areas that use district heating, they could still be one useful tool in a climate change toolbox that needs to be as diverse as possible. Sand batteries might join other grid-scale storage options like <a href="https://newatlas.com/energy/worlds-biggest-battery-tesla-expansion/" data-cms-ai="0">lithium-ion</a>, <a href="https://newatlas.com/energy/gravitricity-gravity-renewable-energy-storage-system/" data-cms-ai="0">gravity</a>, <a href="https://newatlas.com/mit-molten-salt-battery-membrane/53085/" data-cms-ai="0">molten salt</a>, <a href="https://newatlas.com/energy/form-energy-iron-air-battery-bezos/" data-cms-ai="0">iron-air</a> or <a href="https://newatlas.com/energy/symmetrical-flow-battery-grid-scale-storage/" data-cms-ai="0">flow batteries</a>.</p><p>Polar Night Energy says the new sand battery will complete construction and testing in about 13 months.</p><p>Source: <a href="https://polarnightenergy.fi/news" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">Polar Night Energy</a></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In a new collaboration, IBM and NASA created a suite of efficient language models by training on scientific literature. Based on the transformer architecture, these models can be used in a variety of applications, from classification and entity extraction to question-answering and information retrieval. These models achieve high performance across a variety of domains and can respond promptly. We have open-sourced the models on Hugging Face for the benefit of the scientific and academic community.</p><p>Transformer-based language models ‚Äî which include <a href="https://aclanthology.org/N19-1423/">BERT</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692">RoBERTa</a>, and IBM‚Äôs Slate and Granite family of models, are invaluable for a range of natural language understanding tasks. What powers these models is a statistical understanding of how language works. They are trained on masked language modeling tasks, which learns by reconstructing sentences with words that have been obscured. Tokenizers, which break down words into units for the model, play a critical role in learning a vast vocabulary. While general-purpose text training is effective with popular tokenizers trained on datasets like Wikipedia or BooksCorpus, scientific domains require specialized tokenizers for terms like "phosphatidylcholine."</p><p>We trained our models on 60 billion tokens on a corpus of astrophysics, planetary science, earth science, heliophysics, and biological and physical sciences data. Unlike a generic tokenizer, the one we developed is capable of recognizing scientific terms such as "axes" and "polycrystalline." More than half of the 50,000 tokens our models processed were unique compared to the open-source RoBERTa model on Hugging Face.</p><p>The IBM-NASA models, trained on domain-specific vocabulary, outperformed the open RoBERTa model by 5% on the popular <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/BLURB/">BLURB</a> benchmark, which evaluates performance on biomedical tasks. It also showed a 2.4% F1 score improvement on an internal scientific question-answering benchmark and a 5.5% improvement on internal Earth science entity recognition tests.</p><p>Our trained encoder model can be fine-tuned for many non-generative linguistic tasks and can generate information-rich embeddings for document retrieval through <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401">retrieval augmented generation</a> (RAG). RAG commonly follows a two-step framework: a retriever model first encodes the question and retrieves relevant documents from a vector database. These documents are then passed to a generative model to answer the question while ensuring fidelity to the retrieved document.</p><p>We built a retriever model on top of our encoder model to produce information-rich embeddings that map the similarity between pairs of text. Specifically, we optimize on a contrastive loss function, pushing the embeddings of an anchor text closer to those of a relevant (‚Äúpositive‚Äù) document, and farther away from a random (‚Äúnegative‚Äù) document.</p><p>These models used about 268 million text pairs, including titles and abstracts, and questions and answers.  As a result, they excel at retrieving relevant passages in a test set of about 400 questions that NASA curated. This is evidenced by a 6.5% improvement over a similarly fine-tuned RoBERTa model, and a 5% improvement over <a href="https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5">BGE-base</a>, another popular open-source model for embeddings.</p><p>The significant enhancements achieved by our models can be attributed to the specialized training data, custom tokenizer, and training methodology. Consistent with IBM and NASA‚Äôs commitment to open and transparent AI, both models are available on Hugging Face: the <a href="https://huggingface.co/nasa-impact/nasa-smd-ibm-v0.1">encoder model</a> can be further finetuned for applications in the space domain, while the <a href="https://huggingface.co/nasa-impact/nasa-smd-ibm-st">retriever model</a> can be used for information retrieval applications for RAG. We are also collaborating with NASA to enhance science search engine using these models.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Copyright‚Äôs reach is already far too broad, and courts have no business expanding it any further, particularly where that reframing will undermine adversarial interoperability. Unfortunately, a federal district court did just that in the latest iteration of <em>Oracle v. Rimini</em>, concluding that software Rimini developed was a ‚Äúderivative work‚Äù because it was intended to interoperate with Oracle's software, even though the update didn‚Äôt use any of Oracle‚Äôs copyrightable code.</p><p>That‚Äôs a dangerous precedent. If a work is derivative, it may infringe the copyright in the preexisting work from which it, well, derives. For decades, software developers have relied, correctly, on the settled view that a work is not derivative under copyright law unless it is ‚Äúsubstantially similar‚Äù to a preexisting work in both ideas and expression. Thanks to that rule, software developers can build innovative new tools that interact with preexisting works, including tools that improve privacy and security, without fear that the companies that hold rights in those preexisting works would have an automatic copyright claim to those innovations.</p><p>That‚Äôs why EFF, along with a diverse group of stakeholders representing consumers, small businesses, software developers, security researchers, and the independent repair community, filed an <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/eff-rimini-amicus-brief">amicus brief</a> in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals explaining that the district court ruling is not just bad policy, it‚Äôs also bad law.&nbsp; Court after court has confronted the challenging problem of applying copyright to functional software, and until now none have found that the copyright monopoly extends to interoperable software absent substantial similarity. In other words, there is no ‚Äúsoftware exception‚Äù to the definition of derivative works, and the Ninth Circuit should reject any effort to create one.</p><p>The district court‚Äôs holding relied heavily on an erroneous interpretation of a 1998 case, <em>Micro Star v. FormGen</em>. In that case, the plaintiff, FormGen, published a video game following the adventures of action hero Duke Nukem. The game included a software tool that allowed players themselves to build new levels to the game and share them with others. Micro Star downloaded hundreds of those user-created files and sold them as a collection. When FormGen sued for copyright infringement, Micro Star argued that because the user files didn‚Äôt contain art or code from the FormGen game, they were not derivative works.</p><p>The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Micro Star, explaining that:</p></div><div><p><em> [t]he work that Micro Star&nbsp;infringes is the [Duke Nukem] story itself‚Äîa beefy commando type named Duke who wanders around post-Apocalypse Los Angeles, shooting Pig Cops with a gun, lobbing hand grenades, searching for medkits and steroids, using a jetpack to leap over obstacles, blowing up gas tanks, avoiding radioactive slime. A copyright owner holds the right to create sequels and the stories told in the [user files] are surely sequels, telling new (though somewhat repetitive) tales of Duke‚Äôs fabulous adventures.</em></p></div><div><p>Thus, the user files were ‚Äúsubstantially similar‚Äù because they<em> functioned as sequels</em> to the video game itself‚Äîspecifically the story and principal character of the game. If the user files had told a different story, with different characters, they would not be derivative works. For example, a company offering a Lord of the Rings game might include tools allowing a user to create their own character from scratch. If the user used the tool to create a hobbit, that character might be considered a derivative work. A unique character that was simply a 21<sup>st</sup> century human in jeans and a t-shirt, not so much.</p><p>Still, even confined to its facts,<em> Micro Star</em>&nbsp;stretched the definition of derivative work. By misapplying <em>Micro Star</em> to purely functional works that do not incorporate <em>any</em> protectable expression, however, the district court rewrote the definition altogether. If the court‚Äôs analysis were correct, rightsholders would suddenly have a new default veto right in all kinds of works that are intended to ‚Äúinteract and be useable with‚Äù their software. Unfortunately, they are all too likely to use that right to threaten add-on innovation, security, and repair. </p><p>Defenders of the district court‚Äôs approach might argue that interoperable software will often be protected by fair use. As copyrightable software is found in everything from phones to refrigerators, fair use is an essential safeguard for the development of interoperable tools, where those tools might indeed qualify as derivative works. But many developers cannot afford to litigate the question, and they should not have to just because one federal court misread a decades-old case.</p></div></div>]]></description>

For those out of work, finding a new position can become a full-time job. And in tech‚Äîa sector notoriously always looking for the next hot, new thing‚Äîsome people whose days as fresh-faced coders are long gone say that having decades of experience can feel like a disadvantage.</p><p>Ageism is a longtime problem in the tech industry. Database startup RelevantDB went viral in 2021 after it posted a job listing bragging, ‚Äú<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90669478/we-hire-old-people-job-posting-for-software-developer-sparks-a-viral-conversation-about-ageism-in-tech">We hire old people</a>,‚Äù which played off industry stereotypes. In 2020, the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found that <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-u-s-equal-employment-opportunity-commission-confirms-a-pattern-of-age-discrimination-at-ibm">IBM</a> had engaged in age discrimination, pushing out older workers to make room for younger ones.

In response, Jim Habig, LinkedIn‚Äôs vice president of marketing, says: ‚ÄúThis ad didn't meet our goal to create experiences where all professionals feel welcomed and valued, and we are working to replace the spot.‚Äù</p><p>Ageism is ‚Äúan open secret in the tech industry,‚Äù says Maureen Clough, host of <a data-offer-url="https://www.itgetslateearly.com/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.itgetslateearly.com/&quot;}" href="https://www.itgetslateearly.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>It Gets Late Early</em></a>, a podcast about aging in tech. Even when ageism isn‚Äôt as blatant as the IBM case, she says, it lurks behind common ideas in industry hiring, such as culture fit. ‚ÄúIf you have a company that is predominantly young, white, and male, it‚Äôs going to be harder to get in there,‚Äù Clough says.</p><p>Vern Six, a 58-year-old programmer, says he recently ran into explicit ageism on his job hunt. A recruiter told him that he wouldn‚Äôt be appealing to employers and opined that Six should be chief technology officer at this point in his career, not a software developer, Six says.</p><p>After Six‚Äôs <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7167946832742928385/">LinkedIn post</a> about that encounter went viral, he created a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/14418151/">LinkedIn group</a> for people to discuss ageism in tech. He says he has often thought his age might play a role in job hunting, but ‚Äúthis was the first time I‚Äôve ever had anybody say it directly.‚Äù</p><p>Industry and government data shows that US tech workers skew younger than the wider US workforce, but definitive data on differences in hiring patterns for older and younger tech workers has been hard to gather. That‚Äôs because so many more senior tech workers get jobs by networking or moving between companies where they know people rather than by cold applying, and that‚Äôs tricky to study and quantify, says Joanna Lahey, a professor of public policy at Texas A&amp;M University who studies age discrimination.</p><p>Older workers may be out of work for longer between jobs because they‚Äôre more likely to seek higher salaries or be selective, says Lahey. But if older workers are excluded from some positions because recruiters assume they wouldn‚Äôt take a lower offer or position or are perceived as not fitting into the company culture, that‚Äôs a problem, she says. ‚ÄúThere are a lot of people who have a lot of skills who are unemployed longer than they ought to be. It‚Äôs a loss for them, and it‚Äôs a loss for society.‚Äù</p><figure data-testid="IframeEmbed"></figure><h2>D√©j√† Vu</h2><p>Tech companies have laid off more than 400,000 workers over the past two years, according to <a data-offer-url="https://layoffs.fyi/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://layoffs.fyi/&quot;}" href="https://layoffs.fyi/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Layoffs.fyi</a>, which tracks job cuts in the industry. To older workers, the purge is both a reminder of the dotcom bust, and a new frontier. The industry‚Äôs generally consistent growth in recent decades as the economy has become more tech-centric means that many more senior workers‚Äîwhich in tech can sometimes be considered to mean over 35 but includes people in their late forties, fifties, or sixties‚Äîmay have less experience with job hunting.</p><p>For decades, tech workers could easily hop between jobs in their networks, often poached by recruiters.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>I made a game. It‚Äôs called BreakTime. It‚Äôs Breakout (aka Brick Breaker) running inside Google Calendar. Your meetings are bricks. It (optionally) declines the meetings you destroy.</p>



<p>It‚Äôs a chrome extension. You can install it <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/breaktime/efajcgehdfpliglonbkjmifmibpphafk?hl=en&amp;authuser=0">here</a>. It has no external dependencies; it‚Äôs 1,500 lines of javascript including a little game engine I made for the project.</p>

<p>Making it was a ton of fun. Let me tell you about it.
<!-- excerpt-end --></p>

<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>
<p>BreakTime started as an iOS shortcut.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm <em>fascinated</em> with iOS shortcuts. I‚Äôm determined to build something using them. I like <a href="https://eieio.games/nonsense/game-11-flappy-bird-finder/">putting games in weird places</a> and using shortcuts to build a game deep inside the iOS walled garden is a goal of mine<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I realized that the calendar shortcut API was pretty powerful - I could build animations by moving events around. I whipped up the bones of what I thought could be a pong demo and <a href="https://twitter.com/itseieio/status/1757415329783795786">tweeted about it</a>.</p>



<p>I floated Breakout as another potential game and my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/ianthehenry/status/1757464426616435093">Ian Henry</a> suggested actually declining calendar events.</p>

<div>
    
    <p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/breaktime/iantweet.png" alt=""></p><p> ian i am so grateful for this tweet </p>
    
</div>

<p>And so BreakTime was born.</p>

<h2 id="prototype">Prototype</h2>

<p>Whipping up a janky prototype of BreakTime was pretty straightforward. The browser needs to know the coordinates of the elements on screen - it has to draw them all! - and you can ask it for those coordinates with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect"><code>getBoundingClientRect</code></a>. This might not work well for elements that aren‚Äôt rectangles but in BreakTime almost everything is a rectangle!</p>

<p>So the prototype was basically:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Figure out a dom selector that gives me all the calendar events</li>
  <li>Figure out a dom selector that gives me a play area</li>
  <li>Add a div to represent the ball</li>
  <li>Write some javascript to make the ball bounce around, checking for collisions with the rectangles.</li>
  <li>Inject in some CSS to make the ball div round, fade out events that the ball hit, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>It looked something like this:</p>

<div>
    
    
    <video playsinline="" controls="" muted="" poster="https://eieio.games/assets/images/breaktime/breaktime-prototype-1-firstframe.png">
    
        <source src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/breaktime/breaktime-prototype-1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    
    <p> why did i make the ball so big </p>
    
</div>

<p>I cut some pretty big corners to get this all working.</p>

<p>To make collision handling trivial I treated the ball as a square instead of as a circle; you can see that this causes some weird looking bounces.</p>

<p>To animate the ball‚Äôs position I set up a <code>setInterval</code> loop that moved the ball every 50 milliseconds, moved it‚Äôs position via the css <code>transform</code> property, and set the ball‚Äôs <code>transition</code> property to <code>linear 50ms</code> - so long as the <code>setInterval</code> loop runs <em>exactly</em> every 50ms this produces relatively smooth movement (which is to say the movement is not very smooth).</p>

<p>And at the time I figured this wouldn‚Äôt get approved as a chrome extension so I planned to make a bookmarklet. This is where the goal of ‚Äúno external dependencies‚Äù came from. To run the prototype I‚Äôd just copy-paste the javascript directly into the browser console.</p>

<p>The whole thing came out to something like 300 lines including the CSS that I was injecting directly from javascript.</p>

<p>Those hacks made the game pretty gross. I waited far too long to unwind them which created some headaches later.</p>

<p>That said, this janky prototype was enough to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@itseieio/video/7335551871991418155">do pretty well on tiktok</a> and catch the Google social team‚Äôs attention, which was pretty exciting.</p>

<div>
    
    <p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/breaktime/tiktok-screencap.png" alt=""></p><p> never thought this would be a development highlight </p>
    
</div>

<h2 id="collision-handling">Collision handling</h2>

<p>The response from tiktok convinced me that this was worth pursuing, and I figured the first thing I needed to do was move to a proper system for collision handling.</p>

<p>It turns out that determining whether a circle collides with an (unrotated) rectangle is delightfully elegant! The process is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Find the point P on the rectangle that is closest to the circle</li>
  <li>Measure the distance from P to the circle‚Äôs center</li>
  <li>If that distance is smaller than the circle‚Äôs radius you have a collision</li>
</ul>

<p>And finding P is even more elegant. To find the X coordinate of P:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the circle‚Äôs center is to the left of the rectangle, it‚Äôs the left edge of the rectangle</li>
  <li>If the circle‚Äôs center is to the right of the rectangle, it‚Äôs the right edge of the rectangle</li>
  <li>Otherwise, it‚Äôs the X coordinate of the circle‚Äôs center</li>
</ul>

<p>You can repeat the same process for the Y coordinate. Easy!</p>

    <p><img src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/breaktime/chatgpt.png" alt=""></p><p> chatgpt did a good job here </p>
    
</div>

<p>However, there‚Äôs also the problem of figuring out which <em>side</em> of the rectangle the circle bounced off of. And in my journey to solve this problem from first principles (why!) I went a little off the rails.</p>

<p>The approach I took is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Take the circle‚Äôs current position</li>
  <li>Rewind time to the moment of collision</li>
  <li>Compare the center of the circle to the sides of the rectangle - if the circle is (for example) now above the rectangle, bounce off the top</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a ton of edge cases here. And when you get them wrong you get some <em>weird</em> results<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<div>
    
    
    <video playsinline="" controls="" muted="" poster="https://eieio.games/assets/images/breaktime/funnybounce-firstframe.png">
    
        <source src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/breaktime/funnybounce.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    
    <p> that bounce didn't look right... </p>
    
</div>

<p>The big problems I ran into are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The ball should only bounce off the left side of a rectangle when moving to the right (and vice-versa)</li>
  <li>The ball should only collide off a side if, after rewinding time, it‚Äôs center is <em>outside</em> of the rectangle</li>
</ol>

<p>These problems were particularly pernicious when handling corner bounces (where we invert both the X and Y direction of the ball). I eventually realized that you should only bounce off a corner when the ball intersects two sides of a rectangle in the same tick.</p>

<p>I feel kinda silly typing this out because it feels obvious now but man, this stuff is <em>finicky</em>. It probably didn‚Äôt help that I wrote most of this code over one late night (I was excited about the game and thought I could finish it in another day or two. I could not).</p>

<p>I‚Äôve since learned that the typical approach here is about looking at the <em>angle</em> of collision instead. But it was a lot of fun to flail through my approach - and I learned a whole lot doing it.</p>

<h2 id="from-jank-to-juice">From jank to juice</h2>

<p>Proper collision detection made the game feel a lot better but it didn‚Äôt <em>look</em> great. I saw two big problems.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The assets (the ball, paddle, and background) looked simplistic and bad</li>
  <li>There was no ‚Äújuice‚Äù</li>
</ol>

<p>Game devs use ‚Äújuice‚Äù to refer to all the stuff that makes a game feel <em>alive</em> - objects scaling up and down when they collide, particle effects, screenshake, color, good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbetweening">tweening</a> - stuff that doesn‚Äôt change gameplay but instead enhances how the existing gameplay feels.</p>

<p>One of the best talks on juice is called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg">‚ÄúJuice it or lose it‚Äù</a>. The talk takes a barebones game and progressively adds more juice (but no gameplay changes) to show how much it changes the feel of the game. Conveniently the example game is a Breakout clone! I cribbed a lot of ideas directly from it.</p>

<p>To motivate myself to get some effects added quickly I signed up to give a 5 minute presentation at <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center‚Äôs</a> weekly presentations. I‚Äôm a Recurse alum and always find presenting there motivating.</p>

<p>I brought something like this:</p>
<div>
    
    
    <video playsinline="" controls="" muted="" poster="https://eieio.games/assets/images/breaktime/somewhat-juiced-firstframe.png">
    
        <source src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/breaktime/somewhat-juiced.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    
    <p> the color of the ball here really irks me </p>
    
</div>

<p>That looks a lot better! But there‚Äôs still a lot to do. The full set of juice I added includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scaling the ball up and down when it bounces</li>
  <li>Shrinking the paddle when the ball hits it</li>
  <li>Changing the ball‚Äôs color over time (more quickly when it bounces)</li>
  <li>Shaking the screen when an event is destroyed</li>
  <li>Particle effects that match an event‚Äôs color when it shatters</li>
  <li>No background (the background here is ugly)</li>
  <li>Sliding in the gameplay elements at the start</li>
  <li>Blurring the bottom of the screen since there‚Äôs no collision allowed there<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></li>
  <li>Adding a trail to the ball that traces its path</li>
</ul>

<p>It‚Äôd take wayyy too much time to talk about how I approached each of these problems. Let‚Äôs talk about two.</p>

<h4 id="particle-effects">Particle effects</h4>

<p>Creating particles for event shattering was delightfully straightforward. I borrowed heavily from <a href="https://css-tricks.com/adding-particle-effects-to-dom-elements-with-canvas/">this CSS tricks post</a>.</p>

<p>The basic idea is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Get the bounds of the event to shatter</li>
  <li>Get the background color of the computed style of the event</li>
  <li>Divide the bounds of the event into 30 equal-ish rectangles</li>
  <li>Create colored divs for each of those rectangles using the event‚Äôs <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getComputedStyle">computed style</a></li>
  <li>Animate their position, rotation, color, and opacity with some jitter</li>
</ul>

<p>Here‚Äôs approximately what that looks like.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>addParticlesForEvent</span><span>(</span><span>bounds</span><span>,</span> <span>color</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>I did something similar to create particles when the ball bounces against the paddle. And I ended up making a pool of 300 ready-to-use particles that I reused to avoid creating and removing tons of divs (this was probably unnecessary).</p>

<h4 id="screen-shake">Screen Shake</h4>

<p>Screen shake is controversial<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> - too much of it can be nauseating and disorienting. But I‚Äôve found that sprinkling a bit in can really make you feel the impact of a collision. And it turns out that it‚Äôs super easy to add!</p>

<p>My entire implementation is:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>makeScreenShake</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> <span>duration</span> <span>=</span> <span>250</span><span>;</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>magnitude</span> <span>=</span> <span>7.5</span><span>;</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>startTime</span> <span>=</span> <span>null</span><span>;</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>isShaking</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>

    <span>function</span> <span>shake</span><span>(</span><span>currentTime</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>const</span> <span>elapsedTime</span> <span>=</span> <span>currentTime</span> <span>-</span> <span>startTime</span><span>;</span>
        <span>const</span> <span>remainingTime</span> <span>=</span> <span>duration</span> <span>-</span> <span>elapsedTime</span><span>;</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>remainingTime</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>const</span> <span>randomX</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>Math</span><span>.</span><span>random</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>0.5</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>magnitude</span><span>;</span>

            <span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span><span>shake</span><span>);</span>
        <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>mainElt</span><span>.</span><span>style</span><span>.</span><span>transform</span> <span>=</span> <span>"</span><span>translate(0px, 0px)</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>
            <span>magnitude</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span>
            <span>isShaking</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>function</span> <span>startOrContinueShaking</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>startTime</span> <span>=</span> <span>performance</span><span>.</span><span>now</span><span>();</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>isShaking</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>magnitude</span> <span>+=</span> <span>5</span><span>;</span>
        <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>requestAnimationFrame</span><span>(</span><span>shake</span><span>);</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>startOrContinueShaking</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>const</span> <span>screenShake</span> <span>=</span> <span>makeScreenShake</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And I think it makes a huge difference. Here I‚Äôve changed the game to only start the screenshake after a few collisions:</p>
<div>
    
    
    <video playsinline="" controls="" muted="" poster="https://eieio.games/assets/images/breaktime/noscreenshake-firstframe.png">
    
        <source src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/breaktime/noscreenshake.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    
    <p> screenshake starts on the 6th collision </p>
    
</div>

<p>One improvement I could have made here is to have each frame of screenshake depend on the prior frame using a noise generation algorithm (instead of just generating random values). <a href="https://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/3.x/2d/screen_shake/index.html">This article</a> describes an approach I‚Äôve taken in previous games.</p>

<h4 id="other-stuff">Other stuff</h4>
<p>There‚Äôs so much more stuff that I implemented here! I added <a href="https://github.com/nolenroyalty/breaktime/blob/856cdb2ad6f161837023b66d233e59958a674422/code/main.js#L1184">custom tweening logic</a> for ball/paddle scaling because using CSS tweening would interfere with moving the objects around smoothly. The <a href="https://github.com/nolenroyalty/breaktime/blob/856cdb2ad6f161837023b66d233e59958a674422/code/main.js#L1010">ball trail</a> adds elements that track the position of the ball over time while slowly fading out. The <a href="https://github.com/nolenroyalty/breaktime/blob/856cdb2ad6f161837023b66d233e59958a674422/code/main.js#L973">color changing</a> relies on the lovely CSS <code>hue-rotation</code> property.</p>

<p>But this post is super long and there‚Äôs still more to cover. Let‚Äôs keep going!</p>

<h2 id="smoother-animations">Smoother animations</h2>

<p>Remember, my original approach to moving the ball was ‚Äúevery 50ms, move it a fixed amount and rely on the CSS <code>transition</code> property to ensure that that movement is linear.‚Äù</p>

<p>This works ok, but produces unnatural movement if that loop doesn‚Äôt run <em>exactly</em> every 50ms.</p>

<div>
    
    
    <video playsinline="" controls="" muted="" poster="https://eieio.games/assets/images/breaktime/notsmooth-firstframe.png">
    
        <source src="https://eieio.games/assets/images/breaktime/notsmooth.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    
    <p> ignore that bounce off the floor there... </p>
    
</div>

<p>Most of the time this would result in movement that felt just a little bit off, but occasionally you‚Äôd get <em>huge</em> leaps.</p>

<p>To fix this I moved my game loop to rely on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame"><code>requestAnimationFrame</code></a>.</p>

<p>The idea is that you give <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> a function that you want to run immediately before the browser repaints the screen. That callback gets a timestamp representing the amount of time that‚Äôs passed since the previous frame. So if it‚Äôs only been 25ms since the last frame, you only move the ball half as long as if it‚Äôs been 50ms. You end up with a variable frame rate but much smoother animations - especially since the browser will try to sync things up with your monitor‚Äôs refresh rate<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Moving things based on <code>deltaTime</code> is standard practice in games. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGhfUcPjXuE">This video</a> provides a nice overview.</p>

<h2 id="declining-events">Declining events</h2>
<p>I wanted BreakTime to actually be able to decline your events. I think a lot of the joy of a project like this is fully committing to the bit, and the bit here definitely includes ‚Äúnot going to the meetings I destroy.‚Äù</p>

<p>This was a challenge because I didn‚Äôt want any dependencies so I couldn‚Äôt use the calendar API. Instead I needed to script the process of declining the events.</p>

<p>The approach I took relied on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver"><code>MutationObservers</code></a> - an object that watches for changes in the DOM. My observer watches for anything that looks like a calendar dialog, searches that dialog for a ‚Äúdecline‚Äù button, and clicks it.</p>

<p>This was tricky and a little fragile. A few things to highlight:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It‚Äôs important to decline events one at a time<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>. To handle this I <a href="https://github.com/nolenroyalty/breaktime/blob/856cdb2ad6f161837023b66d233e59958a674422/code/main.js#L152">use a second observer to wait for all dialogs tied to the current event to clear</a></li>
  <li>Some events don‚Äôt have a decline option (e.g. if they have no guests); the code must handle that gracefully</li>
  <li>Some events are recurring, which means they spawn a second modal on decline (the modal asks whether you want to decline one or all of the events)</li>
</ul>

<p>But the most fragile bit of logic is that I search for buttons based on their text. This means that event declining only works if Google Calendar is in English. The only other approach I could think of was to hardcode the location in the DOM of the buttons which seemed even worse. But I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs something smarter I could do here.</p>

<p>The final result is a flurry of events popping up and disappearing, which I think is pretty fun.</p>



<h2 id="moving-to-a-chrome-extension">Moving to a chrome extension</h2>

<p>For some reason I thought there was no chance that I could get this into the Chrome Webstore<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>. But my friend <a href="https://www.carolynzhang.com/">Kelin</a> convinced me that I totally could, and I was encouraged by Google‚Äôs social accounts <a href="https://twitter.com/googlecalendar/status/1764769037156843555">tweeting about my stuff</a>.</p>

<p>I was also pretty sick of copy-pasting what had become almost 2,000 lines of javascript and CSS into the browser console every time I wanted to run the game.</p>

<p>It turns out that making an extension is pretty easy! The <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world">intro docs</a> are pretty good and I didn‚Äôt need to do anything fancy. Moving to an extension also made me teach me code to run multiple times without refreshing a tab, which I doubt I would have done with a bookmarklet.</p>

<p>Getting the extension approved took under a day - it probably helps that the extension only runs when invoked so its permissions are pretty simple.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>

<p>This was one of my favorite projects. I‚Äôm particularly happy that, while it involves embedding a game somewhere it doesn‚Äôt belong, the game makes sense for the medium. I‚Äôm very proud of <a href="https://eieio.games/nonsense/game-11-flappy-bird-finder/">Flappy Dird</a> and <a href="https://eieio.games/nonsense/implementing-wordle-in-the-firefox-address-bar/">Wordle in the Firefox address bar</a> but both of those games are totally unrelated to their constraints - they‚Äôre just the best ideas I had for how to build a game given the constraints I had chosen. This feels different.</p>

<p>Building a little engine for this project was <em>great</em>. It definitely took more time but I learned a ton - there‚Äôs simply no way I‚Äôd understand collisions in the same way if I hadn‚Äôt written the logic myself. And I‚Äôm much handier with the DOM after adding my own particles and scripting event declines.</p>

<p>I also have a ton of people to thank for this project. Thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/ianthehenry/status/1757464426616435093">Ian Henry</a> for the initial inspiration, <a href="https://twitter.com/ChanaMessinger/status/1757941634975859132">Chana Messinger</a> for naming the game, <a href="https://kelin.online/">Kelin</a> for convincing me to make a chrome extension, <a href="https://recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> for the encouragement, and <a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/">Josh W Comeau</a> for teaching me all of the CSS and Javascript that I know (I knew basically nothing at the start of this year!).</p>

<p>If you enjoyed this post I‚Äôd encourage you to apply to <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse</a>, which is the best place in the world to build stuff like this in a supportive environment.

                <p>The ‚ÄúProtecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act‚Äù would give the President the power to designate an application under the control of a country considered adversarial to the U.S. to be a national security threat. TikTok would be deemed a threat, meaning that the application would effectively be banned unless it cuts all ties with the foreign adversarial country within 180 days through a forced sale. The same could be true for other applications, like WeChat.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a massive problem that current US law allows for all the big social media platforms to harvest and monetize our personal data, including TikTok. Without comprehensive data privacy legislation, this will continue, and this ban won‚Äôt solve any real or perceived problems. User data will still be collected by numerous platforms and sold to data brokers who sell it to the highest bidder‚Äîincluding governments of countries such as China‚Äîjust as it is now.</p>

<p>TikTok raises special concerns, given the surveillance and censorship practices of the country that its parent company is based in, China. But it‚Äôs also used by hundreds of millions of people to express themselves online, and is an instrumental tool for community building and holding those in power accountable. The US government has not justified silencing the speech of Americans who use TikTok, nor has it justified the indirect speech punishment of a forced sale (which may prove difficult if not impossible to accomplish in the required timeframe). It can‚Äôt meet the high constitutional bar for a restriction on the platform, which would undermine the free speech and association rights of millions of people. This bill must be stopped.</p>

<p dir="auto">We all build software on top of a dynamic set of tools,
frameworks and packages, allowing us to move quickly and only
build what‚Äôs necessary. However, each new wave of dev tooling
innovation results in an entirely new set of dependencies that
need to be managed. What starts as a simple app or microservice
quickly grows complex, and
turns into a expanding and fragmented supply
chain. Flox brings reproducibility and consistency to complex
software development lifecycles.</p>

<p dir="auto">Flox began its life during the deployment of Nix at
the D. E. Shaw group, where it quickly proved invaluable
by making Nix easier for newcomers and offering centralized

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="storywrap-434257">


<h3>from the <i>I-can't-drive-55</i> dept</h3>

<p>Last September, Mozilla came out with a <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/articles/its-official-cars-are-the-worst-product-category-we-have-ever-reviewed-for-privacy/">privacy study</a> indicating that the auto industry was <strong>the worst tech industry the organization tracked</strong>. Mozilla found that not only does the industry hoover up a ton of data from your use of vehicles, it collects and monetizes most of the data on your phone. Often without transparency or adequate safeguards:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>‚Äú<strong>All 25 car brands we researched earned our *Privacy Not Included warning label ‚Äî making cars the official worst category of products for privacy that we have ever reviewed.</strong>‚Äú</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fast forward to this week, and the New York Times‚Äô Kashmir Hill has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/11/technology/carmakers-driver-tracking-insurance.html?unlocked_article_code=1.cE0.jN6D.nfeyIYUoly5W&amp;smid=url-share">a new story</a> exploring how the auto industry is also collecting reams of personal driving data, then sharing it with your insurance company. More specifically, automakers are selling access to the data to Lexis Nexis, which is then crafting ‚Äúrisk scores‚Äù insurance companies then use to adjust rates. Usually upward. </p>
<p>If consumer approval is even obtained, it‚Äôs obtained via fine print buried deep in user agreements either in automakers‚Äô car apps or road-side assistant apps:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>‚ÄúAutomakers and data brokers that have partnered to collect detailed driving data from millions of Americans say they have drivers‚Äô permission to do so. But the existence of these partnerships is nearly invisible to drivers, whose consent is obtained in fine print and murky privacy policies that few read.‚Äù</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even law professors, who are surely used to reckless treatment of consumer data at this point, were somehow surprised at the cavalier behavior by the auto industry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>‚ÄúI am surprised,‚Äù said Frank Pasquale, a law professor at Cornell University. ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs not within the reasonable expectation of the average consumer, it should certainly be an industry practice to prominently disclose that is happening.‚Äù</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the same auto industry that has been fighting tooth and nail against ‚Äúright to repair‚Äù reforms ‚Äî in a bid to protect their lucrative repair monopolies ‚Äî often under the pretense that they‚Äôre just <strong>that</strong> concerned <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2020/09/11/auto-industry-pushes-bullshit-claim-that-right-to-repair-laws-aid-sexual-predators/">about the consumer privacy ramifications</a>. </p>
<p>Please notice that the <strong>absolute bare minimum</strong> that the auto industry could be doing here is making this tracking and monetization of your data transparent, and <em>they‚Äôre not even doing that</em>. Because they know Congress and U.S. federal regulators, lobbied into apathy over decades, are too corrupt to take meaningful action. At least not at any real, consistent scale. </p>
<p>Again, like countless past scandals, this is the direct byproduct of a country that has proven too corrupt to pass even a baseline privacy law for the internet era. Too corrupt to regulate data brokers. And obsessed with steadily defanging, defunding, under-staffing and curtailing the authority of regulators tasked with overseeing corporations with a broad and reckless disdain for U.S. consumer privacy and safety. </p>
<p>Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-urges-ftc-to-investigate-invasive-data-privacy-practices-of-automakers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">urged</a>&nbsp;the Federal Trade Commission to investigate. And California regulators are purportedly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/california-agency-probes-automakers-data-privacy-practices-2023-07-31/#:~:text=The%20California%20Privacy%20Protection%20Agency,which%20companies%20it%20is%20reviewing.">investigating automaker privacy standards</a>. But a grotesquely corrupt Congress means federal inquiries will likely go nowhere (also keep in mind looming Supreme Court rulings are <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/13/supreme-court-chevron-defense-case-00121535">poised to erode federal regulatory authority further</a>). And any inquiries that do materialize will feature fines that are miniscule compared to the money made from the abuses. </p>
<p>The data-hoovering surveillance economy we‚Äôve created is so lucrative, all the financial incentives point in the wrong directions. And the only thing likely to shake U.S. politicians out of their corrupt stupor is a scandal so extreme ‚Äî potentially involving mass fatalities or the leaked data of the rich and powerful ‚Äî that the problem is no longer easy to ignore. And even then, we‚Äôll <strong>still</strong> probably try. </p>

For example where description is very long or nested by many elements. In such cases for now we recommend manually
editing the selectors in cache. These shouldn't be an often case though.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>A short policy memo </span><a href="https://fas.org/publication/update-building-codes-to-use-mass-timber/" rel="">recently posted</a><span> on the Federation of American Scientists‚Äô (FAS) website argues that ‚Äúmass timber can help solve the housing shortage.‚Äù It was posted as part of the </span><a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/your-best-ideas-on-increasing-housing" rel="">Housing Ideas Challenge</a><span>, a collaboration between FAS, Matt Yglesias and a few other organizations to generate new, innovative ideas for building more housing.&nbsp;</span></p><p>The memo calls for the federal government to incentivize states to adopt the most recent version of the International Building Code. The latest version of the Code includes new provisions for building tall timber buildings. According to the memo, because mass timber allows buildings to be built faster and cheaper, changing state building codes to allow tall mass timber buildings will unlock more housing construction:</p><blockquote><p><em>Compared to concrete and steel, mass timber buildings are faster to build (therefore often cheaper), just as safe in fires, and create fewer CO2 emissions. Single- and multi-family housing using mass timber components could help with the 7.3 million gap of affordable homes.</em></p><p><em>Broader adoption could meaningfully increase productivity and thereby reduce construction costs. A 25-story mass timber building in Milwaukee completed in 2022 took 75% less time compared to traditional construction techniques. Developers have reported cost savings of up to 35% through lower time and labor costs.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>I don‚Äôt have particular objections to accelerating mass timber adoption. Mass timber is an interesting technology, and it has some decided advantages over constructing buildings out of steel or concrete. And in general, I‚Äôm in favor of expanding the palette of technologies available for constructing buildings. </span><strong>That said, there is not much reason to think that accelerating mass timber adoption will meaningfully increase the volume of homebuilding in the US.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Mass timber is exactly what it sounds like: construction that uses large, heavy timber elements as the structural frame of the building. In contrast, light-framed timber construction uses small, thin timber elements ‚Äì 2x4s, 2x6s, thin sheets of plywood or OSB ‚Äì as the structural frame.</p><p><span>There‚Äôs a variety of different products that can be used for mass timber construction: Cross Laminated Timber (CLT), Nail Laminated Timber, glue-laminated timber (</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glued_laminated_timber" rel="">glulam</a><span>), mass-plywood panels (MPP), and so on. Mass timber products are typically made by taking smaller timber elements (2x4s or 2x6s, sheets of plywood, etc.) and attaching them together to form much larger elements. Glulams, for instance, are made by taking smaller pieces of dimensional lumber (long pieces of lumber such as 2x4s or 2x6s) and gluing them together to form large beams or columns. CLT is likewise made by gluing together layers of dimensional lumber to form large, solid panels that can be used for walls or floors.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9605b11d-b33d-41ff-a1e2-ce1e85622720_1198x896.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9605b11d-b33d-41ff-a1e2-ce1e85622720_1198x896.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9605b11d-b33d-41ff-a1e2-ce1e85622720_1198x896.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9605b11d-b33d-41ff-a1e2-ce1e85622720_1198x896.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9605b11d-b33d-41ff-a1e2-ce1e85622720_1198x896.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9605b11d-b33d-41ff-a1e2-ce1e85622720_1198x896.png" width="550" height="411.35225375626044" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9605b11d-b33d-41ff-a1e2-ce1e85622720_1198x896.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:896,&quot;width&quot;:1198,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:550,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9605b11d-b33d-41ff-a1e2-ce1e85622720_1198x896.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9605b11d-b33d-41ff-a1e2-ce1e85622720_1198x896.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9605b11d-b33d-41ff-a1e2-ce1e85622720_1198x896.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9605b11d-b33d-41ff-a1e2-ce1e85622720_1198x896.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Mass timber building consisting of glulam beams and columns, and CLT floor panels, via Matt Kantner</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>It‚Äôs the large size of the structural elements that makes mass timber an interesting building system. With light-framed wood construction, the risk of fire limits how tall you can safely build; typically 5 stories in the US (hence the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-over-1" rel="">‚Äú5 over 1‚Äù</a><span> construction type so popular in multifamily construction). And some argue that even these limits are too high, based on the fact that the US has a </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/wood-construction-and-the-risk-of" rel="">much higher rate of fire death</a><span> compared to countries that use less light-frame wood.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But large mass timber elements behave differently than smaller light-framed ones during a fire. Specifically, with mass timber a layer of charred wood forms around the outside that protects the wood on the inside from further combustion. Size your structural elements correctly, and a mass timber building will survive a fire much longer than a light-framed wood building. This gives more time for people to evacuate to safety, which makes it possible to safely build much taller buildings out of wood. While light-framed wood is typically limited to 5 stories in the US, mass timber buildings have been </span><a href="https://www.thorntontomasetti.com/project/ascent" rel="">built up to 19 stories</a><span>.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-142559053" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/mass-timber-is-great-but-it-will#footnote-1-142559053" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span></p><p>Besides its better fire performance, there are other reasons to like mass timber. It sequesters a huge amount of carbon because of the volume of wood it uses, so it's far less carbon-intensive than concrete or steel. It‚Äôs often possible to leave mass timber elements exposed in the finished building, which creates an attractive finish for walls or ceilings that some tenants are willing to pay extra for. Because it‚Äôs prefabricated, the structure of a mass timber building is built very fast, and the construction is much quieter than other building methods.</p><p><span>But mass timber has some challenges, particularly cost. Contra the policy memo, mass timber will in general be more expensive than other types of construction, at least in the US.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-142559053" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/mass-timber-is-great-but-it-will#footnote-2-142559053" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> </span><a href="https://warrington.ufl.edu/due-diligence/2023/03/01/mass-timber-primed-for-wider-use/" rel="">The article</a><span> the memo cites as evidence that mass timber can reduce construction cost in fact mentions twice that mass timber is generally more expensive than steel or concrete. The evidence of savings presented in the article is a single developer who claimed they saved 35% on a project by using mass timber. Even if this is true (and I‚Äôm skeptical), it‚Äôs not much evidence. Construction costs vary enough between projects that for any two building materials, it's probably possible to find an example of someone who saved money by switching from one to the other. But the overall trend is clear: a </span><a href="https://timberfinance.ch/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-International-Mass-Timber-Report_Faster-Download-1.pdf" rel="">survey of commercial builders</a><span> in the US found that the median mass timber project had a cost premium of 2%, and in some cases as high as 15%.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-142559053" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/mass-timber-is-great-but-it-will#footnote-3-142559053" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span></p><p>Mass timber is still somewhat nascent in the US, so it‚Äôs reasonable to believe that costs will come down as more projects are built, designers and developers gain experience, and the supply chain becomes more robust. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if it eventually becomes competitive with structural steel or concrete in the US. But the challenge for mass timber as an enabler of housing construction isn‚Äôt with steel or concrete, but with light-framed wood.</p><p><span>In 2022, </span><a href="https://www.census.gov/construction/chars/current.html" rel="">there were</a><span> just over 1 million single family homes built in the US, and 368,000 multifamily units. Of these, the overwhelming majority were built using light-framed wood construction: 94% of the single family homes, and 73% of the multifamily units.</span></p><p><span>This is a problem for the idea of mass timber as a housing enabler, because mass timber has some inherent cost disadvantages compared to light-framed wood construction. First, for a given structure, mass timber will require more material to build it than light-framed wood will. Consider, for instance, the framing for a building‚Äôs floor.

The input wood for the CLT is slightly higher than the in-use wood because the CLT is made from dimensional lumber planed down to smaller dimensions.</figcaption></figure></div><p>These calculations get more complex for other parts of the structure. But the basic relationship holds: mass timber uses much more wood than light-framed timber to support the same load.</p><p><span>The second cost disadvantage of mass timber compared to light-framed wood construction is that it adds extra processing steps. To produce construction lumber, trees are cut down and brought to a sawmill, where they‚Äôre cut into dimensional lumber (2x4s, 2x6s, etc) or processed into other timber products such as plywood or OSB. Much light-framed wood construction, such as walls and roof rafters, uses dimensional lumber that comes directly from the sawmill. In other cases, such as with floor trusses, the lumber must go through another processing step between the mill and the construction site, but the equipment for this processing is relatively simple and inexpensive. </span><a href="https://www.woodtechsystems.com/product/2003-alpine-floormaster-floor-truss-machine/" rel="">Here</a><span>, for instance, is a used floor truss machine going for less than the price of a fully loaded F-150.</span></p><p><span>With mass timber, on the other hand, </span><em>all</em><span> of the lumber must go through a second processing step to turn it into mass timber products, and this processing step is more expensive than the comparatively simpler truss fabrication. Fabricating CLT panels, for instance, requires an </span><a href="https://kallesoemachinery.com/system-solutions/clt-system-solutions/" rel="">involved production line</a><span> that includes conveyor belts, jointing machines, gluing machines, presses, planing machinery, and (probably) CNC cutting, the combined cost of which can easily be </span><a href="http://www.wooddesignandbuilding.com/the-evolution-of-clt-manufacturing-in-north-america/" rel="">in the millions</a><span>.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-142559053" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/mass-timber-is-great-but-it-will#footnote-4-142559053" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span></p><p><span>Because it uses more material and requires more, costlier processing steps, mass timber has some inherent cost disadvantages compared to light-framed wood construction. And because the vast majority of housing in the US is currently built from light-framed wood, there‚Äôs little reason to think that even a highly-developed mass timber supply chain would meaningfully unlock large amounts of housing construction by way of reduced costs.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5-142559053" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/mass-timber-is-great-but-it-will#footnote-5-142559053" target="_self" rel="">5</a></span></p><p><span>Mass timber is of course superior to light-framed wood construction for taller buildings, since its fire resistance means it's safe to use where light-framed wood isn‚Äôt. But most construction (residential or otherwise) isn‚Äôt tall enough for this to matter ‚Äî over 90% of housing in the US is in buildings 3 stories tall or less, and </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/every-building-in-america-an-analysis" rel="">just 2.5% of housing units</a><span> in the US are in buildings seven or more stories tall.</span></p><p><span>Canada‚Äôs experience with mass timber can give us a glimpse of what full-throated support of mass timber might mean for US housing construction. Like the US, Canada has enormous supplies of wood, and builds much of its housing using light-framed wood construction. Canada, especially the province of British Columbia (BC) has led the charge for the use of mass timber in North America. The Canadian forest product non-profit FPInnovations published a widely-used </span><a href="https://web.fpinnovations.ca/download/clt-handbook-2019-full-edition/" rel="">CLT design handbook</a><span> in 2011, and in 2018 Canada built what at the time was the world‚Äôs tallest mass-timber building, the </span><a href="https://www.thinkwood.com/construction-projects/brock-commons-tallwood-house" rel="">18-story Brock Commons</a><span>. Canada‚Äôs national and provincial building codes have steadily increased the height allowance for timber buildings (though they often fall short of what the current version of the IBC allows), and many provinces have passed legislation requiring wood be the first material considered for publicly funded projects. Many prominent mass timber manufacturers and designers, such as </span><a href="https://seagatemasstimber.com/" rel="">Seagate</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.nordic.ca/en" rel="">Nordic</a><span>, </span><a href="https://eqcanada.com/" rel="">Equilibrium</a><span>, </span><a href="https://mg-architecture.ca/" rel="">Michael Green Architecture</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://structurecraft.com/" rel="">Structurecraft</a><span> are located in Canada. As of 2022, the province of BC alone </span><a href="https://www.thinkwood.com/construction-projects/brock-commons-tallwood-house" rel="">had constructed</a><span> nearly as many mass timber buildings as the entire US.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-142559053" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/mass-timber-is-great-but-it-will#footnote-6-142559053" target="_self" rel="">6</a></span></p><p><span>But government enthusiasm and a robust ecosystem hasn‚Äôt translated into large volumes of residential mass timber construction. Per the 2021 </span><a href="https://d1ied5g1xfgpx8.cloudfront.net/pdfs/40364.pdf" rel="">State of Mass Timber in Canada report</a><span>, between 2007 and 2021 Canada constructed nearly 500 mass timber projects, but just 39 of these were residential projects. This is a tiny fraction of the thousands of apartment buildings built in Canada using other construction methods over the same time period.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7-142559053" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/mass-timber-is-great-but-it-will#footnote-7-142559053" target="_self" rel="">7</a></span></p><p>Like in the US, mass timber is still somewhat nascent in Canada, and I expect the number of mass timber buildings to continue to trend upward over time and costs to continue to fall. Nevertheless, the small residential penetration of mass timber in Canada should give pause to anyone who expects it to drive increased volumes of housing construction in the US.</p><p>It's also worth noting that not adopting the latest building code doesn't necessarily prevent mass timber buildings from being built now, though it certainly makes it easier. Older codes have provisions that allow for shorter mass timber buildings (called Type IV construction), and they can also be built using the code provisions that current light-framed wood structures use (Type III or Type V construction). The updated codes are specifically required only for tall mass timber buildings, or where the mass timber will be left exposed in the final condition.&nbsp;</p><p>But even here, it‚Äôs often possible to get taller mass timber buildings constructed without updating the code. Because the most recent version of the IBC has allowances for tall mass timber buildings, building officials are often willing to accept them even if their state code doesn‚Äôt technically allow them. Several tall mass timber buildings in the US, such as Ascent in Milwaukee, have been built without the state adopting the 2021 IBC‚Äôs mass timber provisions.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, just because a state has adopted the 2021 IBC doesn‚Äôt mean that there won‚Äôt be permitting roadblocks for tall mass timber buildings. Building officials are cautious by nature, and they‚Äôre often reluctant to allow taller wood buildings without very careful consideration, despite what the code says. And what they say goes. Adopting the most recent IBC would reduce the permitting barriers to mass timber adoption, and I‚Äôm in favor of it, but it‚Äôs not like flipping a switch where suddenly mass timber buildings are now possible.</p><p><span>I like mass timber; I </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/another-day-in-katerradise" rel="">spent several years</a><span> at a startup that was trying to make mass produced mass-timber construction happen. It's good for a lot of things, particularly for low-carbon construction, and I'm happy that it's slowly becoming more popular in the US. I think it can ultimately become a popular, competitive construction technology. But it won't jumpstart US homebuilding.</span></p><p><em><span>Thanks to Matt Kantner of </span><a href="https://eqcanada.com/" rel="">Equilibrium Consulting</a><span> for reading a draft of this.

<p>The Internal Revenue Service's free tax filing service, Direct File, is now available in 12 states for taxpayers with simple tax returns. The service, available in English and Spanish, underwent "weeks of successful testing" before the launch, the US Treasury Department <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2172">said today</a>.</p>
<p>"Direct File provides a free, secure option for taxpayers with simple tax situations in 12 states to file their taxes directly with the IRS," the Treasury Department said. "Direct File is easy to use, with no hidden junk fees, and works as well on a smartphone as it does on a laptop, tablet, or desktop computer. Direct File shows taxpayers the math so they can be sure that their return is accurate, and they are getting the refund they are entitled to."</p>
<p>You can check whether you qualify to use the system at <a href="https://directfile.irs.gov/">directfile.irs.gov</a>. Based on the eligibility restrictions in the IRS program, the Treasury Department said it "estimates that one-third of all federal income tax returns filed could be prepared using Direct File."</p>
<p>In the 12 eligible states combined, the department estimates that 18.7 million taxpayers are eligible for Direct File. That includes a high of 5.2 million taxpayers in California and a low of 80,000 in Wyoming. "Thousands of taxpayers across all 12 states have already successfully filed returns during the pilot's testing phase," the Treasury Department said.</p>
<p>The government is calling this year's version of Direct File a pilot program. It will presumably expand to more states and perhaps have fewer restrictions on who can file in future years.</p>
<h2>State tax options vary</h2>
<p>Arizona, California, Massachusetts, and New York worked with the IRS to integrate their state taxes into the Direct File pilot, the IRS <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/irs-to-offer-free-tax-filing-in-competition-against-much-criticized-turbotax/">said in October 2023</a>. The pilot is also available in eight states without an income tax: Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The IRS originally said that Alaska, which also has no income tax, was slated to be part of the pilot. But the state was not included in the end. "The Direct File pilot does not support reporting the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend for federal income tax reporting purposes," the IRS was <a href="https://alaskapublic.org/2024/01/12/alaska-excluded-from-free-irs-direct-tax-filing-pilot-program/">quoted as saying</a> in January.</p>
<p>There are different options for state taxes depending on what state you live in. There's a <a href="https://www.fileyourstatetaxes.org/">free state filing tool</a> for Arizona and New York that integrates with IRS Direct File. Users in California and Massachusetts will be <a href="https://directfile.irs.gov/state">directed</a> to their respective state's online tax tools for filing state taxes.</p>
<h2>What you can and can‚Äôt file</h2>
<p>Direct File supports employment income, unemployment compensation, Social Security benefits, and $1,500 or less in interest income. But there are many limits that would prevent taxpayers from using the system.</p>
<p>Income types that cannot be reported with Direct File include income from payment apps, online marketplaces, or payment cards; income from independent contractor and gig work; income from rent, prizes, and awards; income from pension and retirement account distributions; allocated tips and unreported tips; and alimony.</p>
<p>Direct File is further <a href="https://directfile.irs.gov/income">limited by the amount of income</a>. You can't use Direct File if your wages were over $200,000, or $160,200 if you had more than one employer. Direct File also isn't available to those who use the filing status "Married Filing Separately" and had wages of more than $125,000. For a married couple filing a joint return, there is a combined wage limit of $250,000.</p>
<p>There's another limit related to how you obtain health insurance. Direct File won't work if you bought health insurance from a HealthCare.gov marketplace or if you withdrew money from a health savings account. Other types of health insurance are supported.</p>
<p>Direct File supports the Child Tax Credit, the Earned Income Tax Credit, and the Credit for Other Dependents but does not support other types of credits. Itemized deductions also are not supported, though the IRS says that about 90 percent of people filing federal taxes use the standard deduction.</p>

<p>I didn‚Äôt know what to expect from this 1937 video explanation of how wire photos were transmitted to newspapers, but a double stunt sequence featuring an airplane and a death-defying photographer was not anywhere on my bingo card. This starts kinda slow but it picks up once they get into the completely fascinating explanation of how they sent photographs across the country using ordinary telephone lines. The whole setup was portable and they just hacked into a wire on a telephone pole, asked the operator to clear the line, and sent a photo scan via an analog modem. Ingenious!</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirephoto">The Wikipedia page about wire photos</a> is worth a read ‚Äî French designers argued that the technology was responsible for an early form of fast fashion.</p>

<blockquote><p>After World War II at haute couture shows in Paris, Frederick L. Milton would sketch runway designs and transmit his sketches via B√©linographe to his subscribers, who could then copy Parisian fashions. In 1955, four major French couturiers (Lanvin, Dior, Patou, and Jacques Fath) sued Milton for piracy, and the case went to the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court. Wirephoto enabled a speed of transmission that the French designers argued damaged their businesses.</p></blockquote>

    </div><p>Imported giant sequoia trees are well adapted to the UK, growing at rates close to their native ranges and capturing large amounts of carbon during their long lives, finds a new study led by UCL researchers with colleagues at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.</p>


										      
																																	<p>The new research, published in <i>Royal Society Open Science</i>, found that the most massive species of redwood trees, Sequoiadendron giganteum, known as the giant sequoia, can potentially pull an average of 85 kilograms of carbon out of the atmosphere per year. Though introduced to the UK 160 years ago, this is the first time the trees' growth rate and resilience in the UK have been analyzed.</p>
<p>There are an estimated half a million redwoods in the UK and more are being planted, partly due to their public appeal. In the wild, they are endangered with fewer than 80,000 giant sequoias remaining in their native California range.</p>
<p>Lead author Ross Holland, formerly a Master's student at the UCL Department of Geography and now at East Point Geo, said, "Giant sequoias are some of the most massive organisms on Earth and in their native range make up some of the most carbon-dense forests in the world due to their great age. We found that UK redwoods are well adapted to the UK and able to capture a large amount of carbon dioxide. We hope that these findings can help guide decisions on future tree planting and management."</p>

<p>The researchers emphasize that the most effective way to mitigate <a href="https://phys.org/tags/climate+change/" rel="tag">climate change</a> is by reducing <a href="https://phys.org/tags/carbon+emissions/" rel="tag">carbon emissions</a> from burning fossil fuels. Trees can help by absorbing carbon emissions, but they also provide other important climate, ecosystem and well-being benefits.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>Giant sequoias grow quickly and are also some of the longest-lived organisms in the world, keeping up their rapid growth throughout their 3,000-plus year lives. They can grow up to 90 meters tall, and while not quite the tallest in the world (that title goes to their closely-related cousin the coastal redwood), their wide trunks grow out, giving them the greatest volumes. In addition, they're fire resistant, able to survive blazes that would wipe out forests of other tree species.</p>
<p>The trees grow best in their native range in California's Sierra Nevada mountains, so the researchers wanted to gauge how they fare under UK climates, which are milder and with a wider range of rainfall. They compiled the first dedicated map of giant sequoias in the UK, mapping nearly 5,000 individual known trees.</p>
<p>The team visited three groves of trees, located at Wakehurst, the wild botanic garden of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in Sussex, Havering Country Park in Essex, and Benmore Botanical Garden in Scotland. They set up terrestrial laser scanners to map the trees in 3D, enabling them to measure the heights and volumes very accurately and to create 3D models of 97 representative trees.</p>

    </div>
<p>Co-author Dr. Phil Wilkes, formerly of UCL and now at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, said, "Using the latest laser scanning technology has allowed us to accurately 'weigh' these massive trees without having to cut them down. This means we can measure many more trees as well as revisit them in the future."</p>

																																			<p>The tallest tree they found measured about 180 feet tall (54.87 meters)‚Äîgiant compared with most native UK species, but dwarfed by their American counterparts. This is in part because of the UK sequoias' youth: the oldest giant sequoias in the UK are those at Benmore, the earliest dating to 1863.</p>
<p>Knowing when the trees were planted allowed the team to calculate their average growth rates under the varying climate conditions between the three UK sites. They found that the trees at Kew and Benmore grew at similar rates as their US counterparts, although growing slightly taller and slimmer at Benmore compared to Wakehurst, while at Havering the trees grew more slowly, likely due to less rainfall in the region and competition from dense local woodland.</p>
<p>Though giant sequoia stack up well for sequestering carbon, the researchers caution that planting trees requires long-term commitment, and consideration needs to be given to how well they will thrive in the UK's changing climate in the next 160 years and beyond.</p>

    </div>
<p>Senior author, Professor Mat Disney (UCL Geography), said, "These results give us an important baseline for estimating how well giant sequoias are doing in the UK climate. Currently, these trees are probably more important for their aesthetic and historical interest than they are for solving the climate crisis. But as more are planted we need to know how they will grow.</p>
<p>"The history of these trees in Britain is fascinating‚Äîinitially as symbols of wealth and power, through to now being widely planted in parks and woodlands. They are iconic, but there is almost no work on how fast they grow or how well they will do in the UK's changing climate. I find it amazing to see these giants dotted across the landscape and see how rapidly they are growing."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It remains the mystery at the heart of Boeing Co.‚Äôs 737 Max crisis: how a company renowned for meticulous design made seemingly basic software mistakes leading to a pair of deadly crashes. Longtime Boeing engineers say the effort was complicated by a push to outsource work to lower-paid contractors.</p><p>The Max software„Éºplagued by issues that could keep the planes grounded months longer after U.S. regulators this week revealed a new flaw„Éºwas developed at a time Boeing was laying off experienced engineers and pressing suppliers to cut costs.</p><p>Increasingly, the iconic American planemaker and its subcontractors have relied on temporary workers making as little as $9 an hour to develop and test software, often from countries lacking a deep background in aerospace„Éºnotably India.</p><p>In offices across from Seattle‚Äôs Boeing Field, recent college graduates employed by the Indian software developer HCL Technologies Ltd. occupied several rows of desks, said Mark Rabin, a former Boeing software engineer who worked in a flight-test group that supported the Max.</p><p>The coders from HCL were typically designing to specifications set by Boeing. Still, ‚Äúit was controversial because it was far less efficient than Boeing engineers just writing the code,‚Äù Rabin said. Frequently, he recalled, ‚Äúit took many rounds going back and forth because the code was not done correctly.‚Äù</p><p>Boeing‚Äôs cultivation of Indian companies appeared to pay other dividends. In recent years, it has won several orders for Indian military and commercial aircraft, such as a $22 billion one in January 2017 to supply SpiceJet Ltd. That order included 100 737-Max 8 jets and represented Boeing‚Äôs largest order ever from an Indian airline, a coup in a country dominated by Airbus.</p><p>Based on resumes posted on social media, HCL engineers helped develop and test the Max‚Äôs flight-display software, while employees from another Indian company, Cyient Ltd., handled software for flight-test equipment.</p><h3><strong>Costly Delay</strong></h3><p>In one post, an HCL employee summarized his duties with a reference to the now-infamous model, which started flight tests in January 2016: ‚ÄúProvided quick workaround to resolve production issue which resulted in not delaying flight test of 737-Max (delay in each flight test will cost very big amount for Boeing).‚Äù</p><p>Boeing said the company did not rely on engineers from HCL and Cyient for the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, which has been linked to the Lion Air crash last October and the Ethiopian Airlines disaster in March. The Chicago-based planemaker also said it didn‚Äôt rely on either firm for another software issue disclosed after the crashes: a cockpit warning light that wasn‚Äôt working for most buyers.</p><p>‚ÄúBoeing has many decades of experience working with supplier/partners around the world,‚Äù a company spokesman said. ‚ÄúOur primary focus is on always ensuring that our products and services are safe, of the highest quality and comply with all applicable regulations.‚Äù</p><p>In a statement, HCL said it ‚Äúhas a strong and long-standing business relationship with The Boeing Company, and we take pride in the work we do for all our customers. However, HCL does not comment on specific work we do for our customers. HCL is not associated with any ongoing issues with 737 Max.‚Äù</p><p>Recent simulator tests by the Federal Aviation Administration suggest the software issues on Boeing‚Äôs best-selling model run deeper. The company‚Äôs shares fell this week after the regulator found a further problem with a computer chip that experienced a lag in emergency response when it was overwhelmed with data.</p><p>Engineers who worked on the Max, which Boeing began developing eight years ago to match a rival Airbus SE plane, have complained of pressure from managers to limit changes that might introduce extra time or cost.</p><p>‚ÄúBoeing was doing all kinds of things, everything you can imagine, to reduce cost, including moving work from Puget Sound, because we‚Äôd become very expensive here,‚Äù said Rick Ludtke, a former Boeing flight controls engineer laid off in 2017. ‚ÄúAll that‚Äôs very understandable if you think of it from a business perspective. Slowly over time it appears that‚Äôs eroded the ability for Puget Sound designers to design.‚Äù</p><p>Rabin, the former software engineer, recalled one manager saying at an all-hands meeting that Boeing didn‚Äôt need senior engineers because its products were mature. ‚ÄúI was shocked that in a room full of a couple hundred mostly senior engineers we were being told that we weren‚Äôt needed,‚Äù said Rabin, who was laid off in 2015.</p><p>The typical jetliner has millions of parts„Éºand millions of lines of code„Éºand Boeing has long turned over large portions of the work to suppliers who follow its detailed design blueprints.</p><p>Starting with the 787 Dreamliner, launched in 2004, it sought to increase profits by instead providing high-level specifications and then asking suppliers to design more parts themselves. The thinking was ‚Äúthey‚Äôre the experts, you see, and they will take care of all of this stuff for us,‚Äù said Frank McCormick, a former Boeing flight-controls software engineer who later worked as a consultant to regulators and manufacturers. ‚ÄúThis was just nonsense.‚Äù</p><p>Sales are another reason to send the work overseas. In exchange for an $11 billion order in 2005 from Air India, Boeing promised to invest $1.7 billion in Indian companies. That was a boon for HCL and other software developers from India, such as Cyient, whose engineers were widely used in computer-services industries but not yet prominent in aerospace.</p><p>Rockwell Collins, which makes cockpit electronics, had been among the first aerospace companies to source significant work in India in 2000, when HCL began testing software there for the Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based company. By 2010, HCL employed more than 400 people at design, development and verification centers for Rockwell Collins in Chennai and Bangalore.</p><p>That same year, Boeing opened what it called a ‚Äúcenter of excellence‚Äù with HCL in Chennai, saying the companies would partner ‚Äúto create software critical for flight test.‚Äù In 2011, Boeing named Cyient, then known as Infotech, to a list of its ‚Äúsuppliers of the year‚Äù for design, stress analysis and software engineering on the 787 and the 747-8 at another center in Hyderabad.</p><p>The Boeing rival also relies in part on offshore engineers. In addition to supporting sales, the planemakers say global design teams add efficiency as they work around the clock. But outsourcing has long been a sore point for some Boeing engineers, who, in addition to fearing job losses say it has led to communications issues and mistakes.</p><h3><strong>Moscow Mistakes</strong></h3><p>Boeing has also expanded a design center in Moscow. At a meeting with a chief 787 engineer in 2008, one staffer complained about sending drawings back to a team in Russia 18 times before they understood that the smoke detectors needed to be connected to the electrical system, said Cynthia Cole, a former Boeing engineer who headed the engineers‚Äô union from 2006 to 2010.</p><p>‚ÄúEngineering started becoming a commodity,‚Äù said Vance Hilderman, who co-founded a company called TekSci that supplied aerospace contract engineers and began losing work to overseas competitors in the early 2000s.</p><p>U.S.-based avionics companies in particular moved aggressively, shifting more than 30% of their software engineering offshore versus 10% for European-based firms in recent years, said Hilderman, an avionics safety consultant with three decades of experience whose recent clients include most of the major Boeing suppliers.</p><p>With a strong dollar, a big part of the attraction was price. Engineers in India made around $5 an hour; it‚Äôs now $9 or $10, compared with $35 to $40 for those in the U.S. on an H1B visa, he said. But he‚Äôd tell clients the cheaper hourly wage equated to more like $80 because of the need for supervision, and he said his firm won back some business to fix mistakes.</p><p>HCL, once known as Hindustan Computers, was founded in 1976 by billionaire Shiv Nadar and now has more than $8.6 billion in annual sales. With 18,000 employees in the U.S. and 15,000 in Europe, HCL is a global company and has deep expertise in computing, said Sukamal Banerjee, a vice president. It has won business from Boeing on that basis, not on price, he said: ‚ÄúWe came from a strong R&amp;D background.‚Äù</p><p>Still, for the 787, HCL gave Boeing a remarkable price ‚Äì free, according to Sam Swaro, an associate vice president who pitched HCL‚Äôs services at a San Diego conference sponsored by Avionics International magazine in June. He said the company took no up-front payments on the 787 and only started collecting payments based on sales years later, an ‚Äúinnovative business model‚Äù he offered to extend to others in the industry.</p><p>The 787 entered service three years late and billions of dollars over budget in 2011, in part because of confusion introduced by the outsourcing strategy. Under Dennis Muilenburg, a longtime Boeing engineer who became chief executive in 2015, the company has said that it planned to bring more work back in-house for its newest planes.</p><h3><strong>Engineer Backwater</strong></h3><p>The Max became Boeing‚Äôs top seller soon after it was offered in 2011. But for ambitious engineers, it was something of a ‚Äúbackwater,‚Äù said Peter Lemme, who designed the 767‚Äôs automated flight controls and is now a consultant. The Max was an update of a 50-year-old design, and the changes needed to be limited enough that Boeing could produce the new planes like cookie cutters, with few changes for either the assembly line or airlines. ‚ÄúAs an engineer that‚Äôs not the greatest job,‚Äù he said.</p><p>Rockwell Collins, now a unit of United Technologies Corp., won the Max contract for cockpit displays, and it has relied in part on HCL engineers in India, Iowa and the Seattle area. A United Technologies spokeswoman didn‚Äôt respond to a request for comment.Contract engineers from Cyient helped test flight test equipment. Charles LoveJoy, a former flight-test instrumentation design engineer at the company, said engineers in the U.S. would review drawings done overnight in India every morning at 7:30 a.m. ‚ÄúWe did have our challenges with the India team,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey met the requirements, per se, but you could do it better.‚Äù</p><p>Multiple investigations ‚Äì including a Justice Department criminal probe ‚Äì are trying to unravel how and when critical decisions were made about the Max‚Äôs software. During the crashes of Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines planes that killed 346 people, investigators suspect, the MCAS system pushed the planes into uncontrollable dives because of bad data from a single sensor.</p><p>That design violated basic principles of redundancy for generations of Boeing engineers, and the company apparently never tested to see how the software would respond, Lemme said. ‚ÄúIt was a stunning fail,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúA lot of people should have thought of this problem ‚Äì not one person ‚Äì and asked about it.‚Äù</p><p>Boeing also has disclosed that it learned soon after Max deliveries began in 2017 that a warning light that might have alerted crews to the issue with the sensor wasn‚Äôt installed correctly in the flight-display software. A Boeing statement in May, explaining why the company didn‚Äôt inform regulators at the time, said engineers had determined it wasn‚Äôt a safety issue.</p><p>‚ÄúSenior company leadership,‚Äù the statement added, ‚Äúwas not involved in the review.‚Äù</p><p><em>By Peter Robison</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 09 Jan 2022</p>
<p>
  During discussions with my friends and colleagues, whenever the
  topic of chat protocols comes up, I often remark how simple the
  Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol is and how this simplicity has
  fostered creativity in the lives of many young computer hobbyists
  growing up in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  For many of us who
  were introduced to the Internet during that time, writing an IRC bot
  turned out to be one of our first few non-trivial hobby programming
  projects that involved network sockets, did something meaningful,
  and served actual users.
</p>
<h2 id="simplicity">Simplicity<a href="#simplicity"></a></h2>
<p>
  The underlying payloads that IRC servers and clients exchange during
  an IRC session are quite simple to read manually and understand.
  While implementing IRC servers still involves significant work to
  keep track of users, channels, and exchanging network state and
  messages between servers, implementing IRC clients can often be
  quite simple.  With a convenient programming language, one can
  develop all kinds of fun tools and bots pretty quickly.  Only
  creativity is the limit!
</p>
<p>
  In the early days of IRC, it was quite common for someone with basic
  programming skills to write a simple IRC bot within a matter of
  hours.  Such IRC bots typically responded to requests from users,
  answered frequently asked questions, hosted trivia quiz, etc.  The
  simplicity of the protocol made it very enticing to write programs
  that could talk to IRC servers directly.  In fact, many people chose
  to write the code to parse and create IRC payloads from scratch.
  Observing the TCP/IP packets with a packet analyzer such as
  Wireshark or Tcpdump was all one needed to learn about the various
  payload formats. Additionally,
  <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1459">RFC 1459</a> served
  as a good reference to learn the IRC specification.
</p>
<p>
  As a result of the simplicity of the IRC protocol, sometimes when I
  would find myself needing to join an IRC channel, say to seek some
  technical help, from a system without an IRC client installed, I
  would often just start a <code>telnet</code>, <code>nc</code>,
  or <code>openssl</code> connection directly to my favourite IRC
  network and then type out IRC protocol commands by hand to join the
  channel I need and talk to channel users.
</p>

<h2 id="session">Session<a href="#session"></a></h2>
<p>
  To illustrate how simple the IRC protocol is, here is an example of
  a minimal IRC session that involves joining a channel and posting a
  message:
</p>

  In the above session, the user connects to the Libera Chat network
  with the nickname <code>humpty</code>, joins a channel
  named <code>#test</code>, and posts a message.
</p>
<p>
  Note that the above session is not encrypted.  By convention, IRC
  port 6667 is used for cleartext connections.  A separate port, such
  as port 6697, is available for encrypted connections.  Here is an
  example of an encrypted IRC session established with the OpenSSL
  command line tool:
</p>
<pre><samp>$ <kbd>openssl s_client -quiet -connect irc.libera.chat:6697 2&gt; /dev/null</kbd>

<p>
  The ellipsis denotes lines omitted for the sake of brevity.  The
  remainder of the session is quite similar to the first example in
  this post.
</p>
<p>
  It is worth noting here that although the payload format of IRC
  protocol is quite simple, as one starts writing IRC clients, one
  would stumble upon several tiny details about the protocol that
  needs to be taken care of, e.g., authenticating to the network,
  responding to <code>PING</code> messages from the server to avoid
  ping timeouts, splitting messages into shorter messages so that the
  overall payload does not exceed the message length limit of 512
  characters, etc.  For a serious IRC client, relying on a suitable
  library that already solves these problems and implements the IRC
  specification accurately is of course going to be useful.  But for a
  hobbyist who wants to understand the protocol and write some tools
  for fun, the textual nature of the IRC protocol and its simplicity
  offers a fertile ground for experimentation and creativity.

<p>
  In case you have never used IRC but this post has piqued your
  interest and you want to try it out, you probably don't want to be
  typing out IRC payloads by hand.  You would want a good IRC client
  instead.  Let me share some convenient ways to connect to the Libera
  Chat network.  Say, you want to join the <code>#python</code>
  channel on Libera Chat network.  Here are some ways to do it:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Join via web interface:
      <a href="https://web.libera.chat/#python">web.libera.chat/#python</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Join using Irssi: On macOS, run <code>brew install irssi</code>
      to install it.  On Debian, Ubuntu, or a Debian-based Linux
      system, run <code>sudo apt-get install irssi</code>.  Then
      enter <code>irssi -c irc.libera.chat</code> to connect to Libera
      Chat.  Then within Irssi, type <code>/join #python</code>.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  There are numerous other ways to join IRC networks.  There are GUI
  desktop clients, web browser plugins, Emacs plugins, web-based
  services, bouncers, etc. that let users connect to IRC networks in
  various ways.  On Libera Chat, there are various channels for open
  source projects (<code>#emacs</code>, <code>#linux</code>, etc.),
  communities around specific subjects (<code>##math</code>,
  <code>#physics</code>, etc.), programming languages
  (<code>#c</code>, <code>#c++</code>, <code>#commonlisp</code>,
  etc.).  Type the <code>/join</code> command followed by a space and
  the channel name to join a channel and start posting and reading
  messages there.  It is also possible to search for channels by
  channel names.  For example, on Libera Chat, to search for all
  channels with "python" in its name, enter the IRC
  command: <code>/msg alis list python</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Although I have used Libera Chat in the examples above, there are
  plenty of other IRC networks too such as EFNet, DALNet, OFTC, etc.
  Libera Chat happens to be one of the very popular and active
  networks for open source projects and topic based communities.  I
  use it everyday, so I chose it for the examples here.  There are
  many tight-knit communities on Libera Chat.  Some of my favourite
  ones are <code>#commonlisp</code>, <code>#emacs</code>,
  <code>#python</code>, etc.  All of these have very nice and active
  communities with great attitudes towards beginners.

          <p>We‚Äôre Fly.io and we transmute containers into VMs, running them on our hardware around the world with the power of Firecracker alchemy. We do a lot of stuff with WireGuard, which has become a part of our customer API. This is a quick story about some tricks we played to make WireGuard faster and more scalable for the hundreds of thousands of people who now use it here.</p>
<p>One of many odd decisions we‚Äôve made at Fly.io is how we use WireGuard. It‚Äôs not just that we use it in many places where other shops would use HTTPS and REST APIs. We‚Äôve gone a step beyond that: every time you run <code>flyctl</code>, our lovable, sprawling CLI, it conjures a TCP/IP stack out of thin air, with its own IPv6 address, and speaks directly to Fly Machines running on our networks.</p>

<p>There are plusses and minuses to this approach, which we talked about <a href="https://fly.io/blog/our-user-mode-wireguard-year/" title="">in a blog post a couple years back</a>. Some things, like remote-operated Docker builders, get easier to express (a Fly Machine, as far as <code>flyctl</code> is concerned, might as well be on the same LAN). But everything generally gets trickier to keep running reliably.</p>

<p>It was a decision. We own it.</p>

<p>Anyways, we‚Äôve made some improvements recently, and I‚Äôd like to talk about them.</p>
<h2 id="where-we-left-off"><a href="#where-we-left-off" aria-label="Anchor"></a>Where we left off</h2>
<p>Until a few weeks ago, our gateways ran on a pretty simple system.</p>

<ol>
<li>We operate dozens of ‚Äúgateway‚Äù servers around the world, whose sole purpose is to accept incoming WireGuard connections and connect them to the appropriate private networks.
</li><li>Any time you run <code>flyctl</code> and it needs to talk to a Fly Machine (to build a container, pop an SSH console, copy files, or proxy to a service you‚Äôre running), it spawns or connects to a background agent process.
</li><li>The first time it runs, the agent generates a new WireGuard peer configuration from our GraphQL API. WireGuard peer configurations are very simple: just a public key and an address to connect to.
</li><li>Our API in turn takes that peer configuration and sends it to the appropriate gateway (say, <code>ord</code>, if you‚Äôre near Chicago) via an RPC we send over the NATS messaging system.
</li><li>On the gateway, a service called <code>wggwd</code> accepts that configuration, saves it to a SQLite database, and adds it to the kernel using WireGuard‚Äôs Golang libraries. <code>wggwd</code> acknowledges the installation of the peer to the API.
</li><li>The API replies to your GraphQL request, with the configuration.
</li><li>Your <code>flyctl</code> connects to the WireGuard peer, which works, because you receiving the configuration means it‚Äôs installed on the gateway.
</li></ol>

<p>I copy-pasted those last two bullet points from <a href="https://fly.io/blog/our-user-mode-wireguard-year/" title="">that two-year-old post</a>, because when it works, it does <em>just work</em> reasonably well. (We ultimately did end up defaulting everybody to WireGuard-over-WebSockets, though.)</p>

<p>But if it always worked, we wouldn‚Äôt be here, would we?</p>

<p>We ran into two annoying problems:</p>

<p>One: NATS is fast, but doesn‚Äôt guarantee delivery. Back in 2022, Fly.io was pretty big on NATS internally. We‚Äôve moved away from it. For instance, our <a href="https://fly.io/blog/carving-the-scheduler-out-of-our-orchestrator/" title="">internal <code>flyd</code> API</a> used to be driven by NATS; today, it‚Äôs HTTP.  Our NATS cluster was losing too many messages to host a reliable API on it. Scaling back our use of NATS made WireGuard gateways better, but still not great.</p>

<p>Two: When <code>flyctl</code> exits, the WireGuard peer it created sticks around on the gateway. Nothing cleans up old peers. After all, you‚Äôre likely going to come back tomorrow and deploy a new version of your app, or <code>fly ssh console</code> into it to debug something. Why remove a peer just to re-add it the next day? </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the vast majority of peers are created by <code>flyctl</code> in CI jobs, which don‚Äôt have persistent storage and can‚Äôt reconnect to the same peer the next run; they generate new peers every time, no matter what.</p>

<p>So, we ended up with a not-reliable-enough provisioning system, and gateways with hundreds of thousands of peers that will never be used again. The high stale peer count made kernel WireGuard operations very slow - especially loading all the peers back into the kernel after a gateway server reboot - as well as some kernel panics.</p>

<p>There had to be</p>
<h2 id="a-better-way"><a href="#a-better-way" aria-label="Anchor"></a>A better way.</h2>
<p>Storing bajillions of WireGuard peers is no big challenge for any serious n-tier RDBMS. This isn‚Äôt ‚Äúbig data‚Äù. The problem we have at Fly.io is that our gateways don‚Äôt have serious n-tier RDBMSs. They‚Äôre small. Scrappy. They live off the land.</p>

<p>Seriously, though: you could store every WireGuard peer everybody has ever used at Fly.io in a single SQLite database, easily.  What you can‚Äôt do is store them all in the Linux kernel.</p>

<p>So, at some point, as you push more and more peer configurations to a gateway, you have to start making decisions about which peers you‚Äôll enable in the kernel, and which you won‚Äôt.</p>

<p>Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if we just didn‚Äôt have this problem? What if, instead of pushing configs to gateways, we had the gateways pull them from our API on demand?</p>

<p>If you did that, peers would only have to be added to the kernel when the client wanted to connect. You could yeet them out of the kernel any time you wanted; the next time the client connected, they‚Äôd just get pulled again, and everything would work fine.</p>

<p>The problem you quickly run into to build this design is that Linux kernel WireGuard doesn‚Äôt have a feature for installing peers on demand. However:</p>
<h2 id="it-is-possible-to-jit-wireguard-peers"><a href="#it-is-possible-to-jit-wireguard-peers" aria-label="Anchor"></a>It is possible to JIT WireGuard peers</h2>
<p>The Linux kernel‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/WireGuard/wgctrl-go" title="">interface for configuring WireGuard</a> is <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/netlink/intro.html" title="">Netlink</a> (which is basically a way to create a userland socket to talk to a kernel service). Here‚Äôs a <a href="https://github.com/WireGuard/wg-dynamic/blob/master/netlink.h" title="">summary of it as a C API</a>. Note that there‚Äôs no API call to subscribe for ‚Äúincoming connection attempt‚Äù events.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs OK! We can just make our own events. WireGuard connection requests are packets, and they‚Äôre easily identifiable, so we can efficiently snatch them with a BPF filter and a <a href="https://github.com/google/gopacket" title="">packet socket</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the time, it‚Äôs even easier for us to get the raw WireGuard packets, because our users now default to WebSockets WireGuard (which is just an unauthenticated WebSockets connect that shuttles framed UDP packets to and from an interface on the gateway), so that people who have trouble talking end-to-end in UDP can bring connections up.</p>
<p>We own the daemon code for that, and can just hook the packet receive function to snarf WireGuard packets.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not obvious, but WireGuard doesn‚Äôt have notions of ‚Äúclient‚Äù or ‚Äúserver‚Äù. It‚Äôs a pure point-to-point protocol; peers connect to each other when they have traffic to send. The first peer to connect is called the <strong>initiator</strong>, and the peer it connects to is the <strong>responder</strong>.</p>

<p>For Fly.io, <code>flyctl</code> is typically our initiator,  sending a single UDP packet to the gateway, which is the responder. According <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/papers/wireguard.pdf" title="">to the WireGuard paper</a>, this first packet is a <code>handshake initiation</code>.  It gets better: the packet type is recorded in a single plaintext byte. So this simple BPF filter catches all the incoming connections: <code>udp and dst port 51820 and udp[8] = 1</code>.</p>

<p>In most other protocols, we‚Äôd be done at this point; we‚Äôd just scrape the username or whatnot out of the packet, go fetch the matching configuration, and install it in the kernel. With WireGuard, not so fast. WireGuard is based on Trevor Perrin‚Äôs <a href="http://www.noiseprotocol.org/" title="">Noise Protocol Framework</a>, and Noise goes way out of its way to <a href="http://www.noiseprotocol.org/noise.html#identity-hiding" title="">hide identities</a> during handshakes. To identify incoming requests, we‚Äôll need to run enough Noise cryptography to decrypt the identity.</p>

<p>The code to do this is fussy, but it‚Äôs relatively short (about 200 lines). Helpfully, the kernel Netlink interface will give a privileged process the private key for an interface, so the secrets we need to unwrap WireGuard are easy to get. Then it‚Äôs just a matter of running the first bit of the Noise handshake. If you‚Äôre that kind of nerdy, <a href="https://gist.github.com/tqbf/9f2c2852e976e6566f962d9bca83062b" title="">here‚Äôs the code.</a></p>

<p>At this point, we have the event feed we wanted: the public keys of every user trying to making a WireGuard connection to our gateways. We keep a rate-limited cache in SQLite, and when we see new peers, we‚Äôll make an internal HTTP API request to fetch the matching peer information and install it. This fits nicely into the little daemon that already runs on our gateways to manage WireGuard, and allows us to ruthlessly and recklessly remove stale peers with a <code>cron</code> job.</p>

<p>But wait! There‚Äôs more! We bounced this plan off Jason Donenfeld, and he tipped us off on a sneaky feature of the Linux WireGuard Netlink interface.</p>
<p>Jason is the hardest working person in show business.</p>
<p>Our API fetch for new peers is generally not going to be fast enough to respond to the first handshake initiation message a new client sends us. That‚Äôs OK; WireGuard is pretty fast about retrying. But we can do better.</p>

<p>When we get an incoming initiation message, we have the 4-tuple address of the desired connection, including the ephemeral source port <code>flyctl</code> is using. We can install the peer as if we‚Äôre the initiator, and <code>flyctl</code> is the responder. The Linux kernel will initiate a WireGuard connection back to <code>flyctl</code>. This works; the protocol doesn‚Äôt care a whole lot who‚Äôs the server and who‚Äôs the client. We get new connections established about as fast as they can possibly be installed.</p>

<p>We‚Äôve been running this in production for a few weeks and we‚Äôre feeling pretty happy about it. We went from thousands, or hundreds of thousands, of stale WireGuard peers on a gateway to what rounds to none. Gateways now hold a lot less state, are faster at setting up peers, and can be rebooted without having to wait for many unused peers to be loaded back into the kernel.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll leave you with this happy Grafana chart from the day of the switchover.</p>

<p><img alt="a Grafana chart of 'kernel_stale_wg_peer_count' vs. time. For the first few hours, all traces are flat. Most are at values between 0 and 50,000 and the top-most is just under 550,000. Towards the end of the graph, each line in turn jumps sharply down to the bottom, and at the end of the chart all datapoints are indistinguishable from 0." src="https://fly.io/blog/jit-wireguard-peers/assets/wireguard-peers-graph.webp"></p>

<p><strong>Editor‚Äôs note:</strong> Despite our tearful protests, Lillian has decided to move on from Fly.io to explore new pursuits. We wish her much success and happiness!&nbsp;‚ú®</p>

								<p>Recently, a former employee of F5 and main contributor of the Nginx project announced the fork <a href="http://freenginx.org/">Freenginx</a> of the popular web server. The new project was started to <a href="https://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx-devel/2024-February/K5IC6VYO2PB7N4HRP2FUQIBIBCGP4WAU.html">address a security dispute</a> and wants to be a drop-in replacement of Nginx, run by developers rather than corporate entities. <a href="http://mdounin.ru/">Maxim Dounin</a>, formerly principal software engineer at F5, provides insights into the fork:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, some new non-technical management at F5 recently decided that they know better how to run open-source projects. In particular, they decided to interfere with the security policy Nginx has used for years, ignoring both the policy and the developers' position.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Originally developed by <a href="http://sysoev.ru/en/">Igor Sysoev</a> and currently maintained by F5, Nginx is open-source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, and media streaming. According to the <a href="https://www.netcraft.com/blog/january-2024-web-server-survey/">Web Server Survey</a>, even two decades after its initial launch, Ngnix remains the leading web server serving 23.21% of all sites. In a popular <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39373327">thread</a> on Hacker News, user <em>sevg</em> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39373804">points out</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Worth noting that there are only two active "core" devs, Maxim Dounin (the OP) and Roman Arutyunyan. Maxim is the biggest contributor that is still active. Maxim and Roman account for basically 99% of the current development. So this is a pretty impactful fork.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In his announcement on the <a href="https://mailman.nginx.org/mailman/listinfo/nginx-devel">nginx-devel mailing list</a>, Dounin highlights the <a href="https://freenginx.org/pipermail/nginx/2024-February/000007.html">initial dispute</a> that prompted Nginx to issue a security patch addressing two critical vulnerabilities. He adds:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am no longer able to control which changes are made in Nginx within F5, and I no longer see Nginx as a free and open-source project developed and maintained for the public good. As such, starting from today, I will no longer participate in Nginx development as run by F5. Instead, I am starting an alternative project, which is going to be run by developers, and not corporate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Freenginx is not the first fork and drop-in replacement for Nginx: <a href="https://github.com/webserver-llc/angie">Angie</a> was created by other Russian Nginx developers when F5 left Russia in 2020 and it is currently managed by the Russian company <a href="https://wbsrv.ru/">Web Server</a>. Diogo Baeder, lead backend developer at DeepOpinion, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7164034851187113984-YnaE/?">comments</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nginx is an incredible software and platform, but I was wondering if it wouldn't be time to just bite the bullet and create a more modern solution based on Rust. Having a solution that follows a similar model, "understands" the Nginx configuration language, and reaches similar performance levels, but with the memory safety and wide community adoption of Rust could lead to an amazing new project - perhaps even doing to Nginx what Nginx did to Apache HTTP.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Vincentz Petzholtz, network engineer and architect, is less optimistic and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vincentz-berlin_announcing-freenginxorg-activity-7164343754835931136-_GEM?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">adds</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes a fork is all you can do when a project is taken into a difficult direction. In the end, the users will vote with the adoption and install-base.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first release version is <a href="https://freenginx.org/en/download.html?utm_source=thenewstack&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_content=inline-mention&amp;utm_campaign=platform">Freenginx-1.25.4</a> under the same BSD license as Nginx. Dounin has provided access to a read-only <a href="http://freenginx.org/hg/nginx">Mercurial repository</a>, discarding for now the <a href="https://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx-devel/2024-February/YIFSHIYSKDFBYZ2QRA3WF6SRPGIBDBKI.html">option to migrate to GitHub</a>. The project started a new <a href="https://freenginx.org/en/support.html">developer mailing list</a>.</p>
