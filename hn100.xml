            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://sustainableviews.substack.com/p/the-day-i-kissed-comment-culture">https://sustainableviews.substack.com/p/the-day-i-kissed-comment-culture</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45143077">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>It started out harmlessly, a comment on hacker news roughly 16 years ago. </p><p>From there it expanded to reddit, substack, twitter. And it increased in frequency, from every few months to every week, peaking at several times a day. It became an addictive, productive habit—I would scan the headlines for a catchy title, quickly skim the piece, and then race to the comment section and type one out. </p><p>Sometimes the comments were insightful or funny. At other times, curt or nitpicky. It was an exercise of logic, of ideation, of debate. It was a mix of disdain, delight and discourse. But mostly it was just a fun time. </p><p>Being an active commenter felt like being an internet socialite, part of an elite society of people who put their voice out there instead of lurked. And my fellow internet socialites responded in turn. Some upvoted, responded, debated. Some liked what I said, some hated it. A few of my comments made it to the top and became a fountain of dopamine. A few comments made it to the very bottom too. </p><p>That can happen with 16 years of commenting history. </p><p>I’ve benefited incredibly from commenting. It has sharpened both my writing and logic. It has developed my voice. It has trained me in debate. It has unleashed personas that I would otherwise never become—teacher, supporter, economist, historian, debater, and of course, troll. </p><p>It has made me a (mostly) better person. But I cannot shake the conviction that I need to leave commenting for good.</p><p>Why? Well, I’ve been reflecting on what I want out of the internet (as part of a larger reflection of what I want out of life). I’ve always enjoyed the internet as the frontier of  “new”—its where I find novel ideas, content, thoughts, personalities, achievements and craft. But with the rise of doom scrolling, media echo chambers, AI, and my age, “new” is no longer that exciting. I find myself less satisfied browsing the internet, hoping the next thing I consume to be actually high quality, and I’m realizing that I’d rather just spend my time with a good set of quality friends. </p><p>Unfortunately, this is where comment culture comes in. 16 years of commenting has made me zero friends. </p><p>That scares me. All of that social activity with zero ROI. At first, I thought that I needed to change my commenting habits, and, you know, try to make connections. But the more I considered how to make friends in comment culture, the more I realized that it wasn’t just my own social ineptitude. Comment culture has a problem. Systemically, it produces an internet of strangers.</p><p>Now, making friends in real life is not easy and it doesn’t get easier over time. The social steps of growing your friend pool involve 1) meeting new people, 2) turning strangers into acquantainces, and 3) turning acquantainces into friends. This takes a surprising amount of volume and time. </p><p>Various estimates of lifetime human acquantainces range from 10,000 to 80,000 people, but actual friendships number only in the hundreds, and that’s being generous. And the number of close friends is on average, only 3-5. So, meeting strangers and turning them into close friends is a rather rare occurence that involves a serious investment of focused social energy, something that is harder to do the older you get. One study showed that in order to form a close friendship, you need to spend 200 hours of interaction time with one person. So, making 5 close friends is a 1000 hour investment, equal to a full time job for half a year. </p><p>Comment culture requires your social energy. It’s an interaction with another human being, but one that doesn’t head towards building relationships. Instead, the end result is gaining reputation, fame, and of course, internet points.</p><p>This isn’t a bad thing; besides close friends, the other spend of social energy is towards reputation and influence, especially in small communities. But in comment culture, each post is its own communal space of random strangers. It is the illusion of small community, but really the community appears and dissappears with every new post. Outside of a handful of celebrities or moderators, I rarely find myself spotting someone I know in the comments. </p><p>The end result is that comment culture is a series of one-offs with anonymous strangers upvoting you or responding to you, but never befriending you. In comment culture, you are talking to a random sampling of everybody, which is in itself a collective nobody.</p><p>Broadly speaking, the online platforms we use are not built for connection; they are built for engagement. This is universally true for all internet spaces, from stories to newsfeeds, for the intellectual and the plebian alike. And in the relentless optimization of user engagement, our social engagement is captured and rerouted from its original purpose. Instead of making friends, we are all performing for one collective internet stranger—a being that is sometimes brilliant, sometimes cruel, but always waiting to be impressed.</p><p>It somehow feels like interactions that might have grown a friendship have instead ended up growing ad impressions. This is not strictly true, but I can’t shake the feeling that it isn’t wrong either.</p><p>So this is where I say goodbye to my fellow comment writing socialites. I might miss you a bit, but you will not miss me, because you don’t even know me. I'm a stranger, and you, dear reader, are likely a stranger too. </p><p>Where do I go instead? Well, as long as engagement makes money, the pressure will always be there, from forces far bigger than us, to pull our social instincts out into the open forum where they can be measured, tracked, and sold. This isn’t a problem with comments or our internet spaces. Its a problem of market forces.</p><p>But as long as we want to make and keep good friends, that itself is its own driving force. It’s what drives us to gather a group of people around a campfire. It revives LAN parties from the childhood days. It creates those long chains of memes sent to the few that truly appreciate them. It builds its own spaces not bound to one platform or another, but bound to the people know, care for, and love.</p><p>But… knowing me, I’ll probably be on Discord.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>
            Recently I’ve been on a small campaign to try to make my personal website more… personal. Little ways to
            make it obvious it’s <em>mine</em> and <em>personal</em>, not just another piece of the boring corporate
            dystopia that is most of the web these days. I don’t quite want to fully regress to the Geocities era and
            fill the screen with animated under construction GIFs, but I do want to capture some of that vibe.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’d added some bits and pieces along those lines: floating images in articles now look like they’re stuck to
            the page with sellotape, related post links have a wavy border that animates when you hover over them, and
            so on. Next, I wanted to change the heading fonts from a monospace font to something cursive, to resemble
            handwriting. Less terminal output, more handwritten letter. I couldn’t find one I liked, though. So why not
            make my own? It can’t be that hard, right?
          </p>
          <h3>Failing to do it myself</h3>
          <p>
            I set out to try to make the font myself using open source tools. After doing a bit of research, it seemed
            like the general approach was to create vectors of each character and then import them into a font editor.
            That seems to mean either Adobe Illustrator and FontLab (if you have too much money) or Inkscape and
            FontForge (if you like open source). I fall firmly into the latter category, so I grabbed my graphics tablet
            and opened Inkscape.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wrote out my first three letters: capital A, B and C. Saved them in Inkscape, and attempted to import them
            into FontForge. Then I remembered one crucial thing that had slipped my mind: I absolutely loathe using
            FontForge. It’s a bit like when you open an old version of GIMP and get a bunch of weird looking windows
            floating all over the place; it feels like you’re fighting against the tool to do even the most basic
            operations. The difference is I have cause to edit images a <em>lot</em> more than I edit fonts, and GIMP
            has actually significantly improved their UI over the years.
          </p>
          <p>Here are the rough steps I went through with FontForge:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Launch Font Forge. It shows a weird bit of art in one window, and an open file dialog in another.</li>
            <li>I don’t want to open a file, so I close that dialog. The program exits.</li>
            <li>Relaunch Font Forge, and realise that within the “Open Font” dialog is a “New” button. Click it.</li>
            <li>
              Get to the standard font-editing UI. Right-click on the “A” looking for a way to import an SVG. Don’t see
              one.
            </li>
            <li>
              Click around a bit, exploring the menus. Everything feels a bit off. You can’t open one menu then hover
              over the next to see its content, like basically every UI toolkit in existence. I think FontForge has
              eschewed QT and GTK in favour of doing things itself.
            </li>
            <li>Find the “Import” option in the File menu. Hope it’s for a single glyph not the whole font.</li>
            <li>
              A file picker opens. Again it’s all a bit off from normal desktop conventions. Try to resize it, and just
              get blank gray space at the bottom.
            </li>
            <li>Type the absolute path I want to go to in the text field.</li>
            <li>Get a dialog saying “Not a bdf file /home/chris/etc”. Press OK.</li>
            <li>Get a dialog saying “Could not find a bitmap font in”. Press OK.</li>
            <li>
              Press Ctrl+L to see if that lets me enter a path. Click everything in the dialog to try to find a way to
              enter a path. Get annoyed. Give up. Click through folder-by-folder to get to where I want to be.
            </li>
            <li>
              Get to the folder and don’t see any files. Change the format to “SVG”. Double-click the newly-visible SVG
              file.
            </li>
            <li>Get a dialog saying “You must select a glyph before you can import an image into it”. Press OK.</li>
            <li>The import dialog goes away, having not imported.</li>
            <li>Select the glyph in the main tool area, then repeat the File→Import dance.</li>
            <li>
              It’s actually there now! Open the glyph in the editor and see it’s a complete mess of Bézier curves. I
              can’t click what I want without accidentally moving a handle for an adjacent curve.
            </li>
            <li>Rage-quit.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            I’m sure FontForge is less anger inducing once you’re used to it. And you definitely could use it to build a
            font like this if you had much more patience than me. I’d had enough of death-by-a-thousand-paper-cuts
            though.
          </p>
          <p>
            I briefly tried Inkscape’s built-in support for making an SVG font. It annoyed me a lot less, but it’s
            fiddly: it seemed like each font had to be a single path, so you had to convert the glyphs to paths, then
            merge them correctly. If you merge them incorrectly then the wrong bits of your letters end up filled (like
            the inside of the ‘B’). Path manipulation is getting towards the limit of my knowledge of vector editing,
            and it took a bit of trial and error for each letter that had more than a single stroke. I didn’t fancy
            doing that for every letter.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m usually a big advocate of open source, but this was one of those painful times where it feels like it
            just falls short. Clunky, painful UI and processes where commercial tools just let you get on with your
            work.
          </p>
          <h3>You can exchange money for goods and services</h3>
          <p>
            When I’d been looking for open source tutorials, I found many mentions of a closed source, hosted tool:
            <a href="https://www.calligraphr.com/en/">Calligraphr</a>. It has a free version with limitations (no
            ligatures, no variations, 75 glyphs per font), and a pro version for £8/month. I’d normally balk at the idea
            of a subscription for this, but they have the perfect answer: you can make a one-time payment, and your
            account automatically downgrades back to free after a month. It’s not a hidden option, either, it’s the most
            prominent button on the upgrade page. That made me happy to give them £8 to play around with the service for
            a month.
          </p>
          <p>
            Calligraphr works by having you print templates, write out the letters, then scan them in. It does some
            magical processing to extract the glyphs, provides tools to tidy them up, align them, etc, and then produces
            a TTF file for you. You can see some of my completed templates here:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <picture>
              <source srcset="https://chameth.com/making-a-font-of-my-handwriting/template.avif" type="image/avif">
              <source srcset="https://chameth.com/making-a-font-of-my-handwriting/template.webp" type="image/webp">
              <img src="https://chameth.com/making-a-font-of-my-handwriting/template.jpg" alt="Eight scanned template sheets, filled in with handwritten letters and ligatures" loading="lazy" width="1166" height="841">
            </picture>
            <figcaption>Most of the templates I used for the font</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Calligraphr has a nice UI to generate the templates, allowing you to select which glyphs to include. I added
            the “minimal English”, “basic punctuation” and “Ligatures” sets. That gave me four pages to fill out, and I
            did them all twice. That let me filter out versions that didn’t work well, and have variants for some
            letters so the font wasn’t too repetitive. Later on, I went back and added some custom ligatures based on
            blog post titles that didn’t look quite right: “Re”, “To”, “ers”, “ey”, “hy”, “ra”, “re” and “ty”. Ligatures
            like this help it look more natural: when we write we don’t just stamp out identical letters regardless of
            their surroundings, instead they will connect to their neighbours, or overlap slightly, or even share a
            stroke.
          </p>
          <p>
            I filled these templates in with a Sharpie, as I wanted a fairly informal, scrap-booky look, and it would
            also give good solid shapes that should be easy to pick out of the template. I scanned them with the “Scan
            Document” function on my iPhone, and uploaded the PDFs to Calligraphr.
          </p>
          <h3>Iterating and tweaking</h3>
          <p>
            The Calligraphr UI allows you to preview the font, but I found it a lot more useful to just download a copy
            and use it on a local copy of my website. That let me test it with real text, and see how it’d look at the
            different font sizes I use on the site.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first version was not great. Despite the guidelines on the template, I apparently wasn’t good at
            sticking to them. Some letters were floating way off the baseline, and some were sunken below. When those
            opposites met it looked terrible. Fortunately Calligraphr has a pretty easy tool to slide each letter up and
            down, and scale it up or down if needed, and you can see it next to other letters as you do it. It took a
            little bit of time to go through all the variants of all the letters, but the next version looked a lot
            better.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another tweak I ended up doing was reducing the spacing between letters. The defaults Calligraphr uses are
            probably good for a blocky font, but I wanted to put the letters close together to give it more of a
            joined-up look. Again, this is an easy tool to use, you just drag the sides in or out as desired. While
            these tweaking steps were probably as fiddly as some of the Inkscape steps I refused to do earlier, they’re
            a lot more rewarding as you see things improving with each one. It’s a lot easier for me to commit time and
            effort to improving something that’s already working reasonably, than put that time and energy into an
            unknown.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later, I noticed that occasionally there would be a huge gap in a title. Not “the kerning is slightly off”
            but “there’s enough room to park a bus”. It took me a while to figure out what was happening: a couple of
            glyphs hadn’t been isolated perfectly and had picked up a few pixels from the template lines at the edge of
            their boxes. That meant the glyph had a width that covered the actual written glyph, a big gap, and then the
            rogue marks. At first, I fixed this by just adjusting the width, but that left the little pixels floating
            awkwardly down-sentence. The proper fix was to use the editing tool and simply delete them, and then
            Calligraphr snapped the width back to what it should be.
          </p>
          <p>
            These iterations took a while to do, but I just dipped in and out occasionally over the course of a week, so
            it didn’t actually feel like too much work. I quite enjoy the process of refining things, too.
          </p>
          <h3>Result and a surprise</h3>
          <p>
            If you’re viewing this post on my website<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>, you can see the font in the headers, captions, and a few other places. Here’s how it compares to my
            actual handwriting:
          </p>
          <figure>

            </picture>
            <figcaption>My handwriting vs my handwriting font</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            It’s not close enough to forge documents, but I think it definitely gets across my style, and that’s exactly
            what I wanted. It’s surprisingly legible even at smaller font sizes — I think the weight of the Sharpie
            helps here — and at £8 and a bit of manual work was a lot more economical than spending days wresting with
            open source tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            A few weeks after I put the finishing touches on the font, I got an e-mail from Calligraphr. As my account
            had lapsed back to the free version, I was no longer eligible for the “server-side backup” feature. So what
            did they do? They e-mailed me an exported copy! It’s a JSON file with the properties of each glyph and a
            base64 encoded image. Not only can I re-upload this to Calligraphr if I resubscribe, I can probably hook
            something up to edit it should I ever need to. I’m blown away by how pro-user Calligraphr’s business
            practices are. They’re up-front about pricing, don’t try and get you stuck on an auto-renewing subscription,
            and automatically export your data. It’s like a breath of fresh air compared to the barrage of dark patterns
            that other websites foist on us. If you want to make this kind of font, I’d definitely recommend them just
            because of how <em>nice</em> they are.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>I’ve spent a good deal of my professional life arguing against using protobuffers. They’re clearly written by amateurs, unbelievably ad-hoc, mired in gotchas, tricky to compile, and solve a problem that nobody but Google really has. If these problems of protobuffers remained quarantined in serialization abstractions, my complaints would end there. But unfortunately, the bad design of protobuffers is so persuasive that these problems manage to leak their way into your code as well.</p>
<h2 id="ad-hoc-and-built-by-amateurs">Ad-Hoc and Built By Amateurs</h2>
<p>Stop. Put away your email client that is half-way through writing me about how “Google is filled with the world’s best engineers,” and that “anything they build is, by definition, not built by amateurs.” I don’t want to hear it.</p>
<p>Let’s just get this out of the way. Full disclosure: I used to work at Google. It was the first (but unfortunately, not the last) place I ever used protobuffers. All of the problems I want to talk about today exist inside of Google’s codebase; it’s not just a matter of “using protobuffers wrong” or some such nonsense like that.</p>
<p>By far, the biggest problem with protobuffers is their terrible type-system. Fans of Java should feel right at home with protobuffers, but unfortunately, literally nobody considers Java to have a well-designed type-system. The dynamic typing guys complain about it being too stifling, while the static typing guys like me complain about it being too stifling without giving you any of the things you actually want in a type-system. Lose lose.</p>
<p>The ad-hoc-ness and the built-by-amateurs-itude go hand-in-hand. So much of the protobuffer spec feels bolted on as an afterthought that it clearly <em>was</em> bolted on as an afterthought. Many of its restrictions will make you stop, scratch your head and ask “wat?” But these are just symptoms of the deeper answer, which is this:</p>
<p>Protobuffers were obviously built by amateurs because they offer <em>bad solutions to widely-known and already-solved problems.</em></p>
<h3 id="no-compositionality">No Compositionality</h3>
<p>Protobuffers offer several “features”, but none of them see to work with one another. For example, look at the list of orthogonal-yet-constrained typing features that I found by skimming the <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3">documentation</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>oneof</code> fields can’t be <code>repeated</code>.</li>
<li><code>map&lt;k,v&gt;</code> fields have dedicated syntax for their keys and values, but this isn’t used for any other types.</li>
<li>Despite <code>map</code> fields being able to be parameterized, no user-defined types can be. This means you’ll be stuck hand-rolling your own specializations of common data structures.</li>
<li><code>map</code> fields cannot be <code>repeated</code>.</li>
<li><code>map</code> keys <em>can</em> be <code>string</code>s, but <em>can not</em> be <code>bytes</code>. They also can’t be <code>enum</code>s, even though <code>enum</code>s are considered to be equivalent to integers everywhere else in the protobuffer spec.</li>
<li><code>map</code> values cannot be other <code>map</code>s.</li>
</ul>
<p>This insane list of restrictions is the result of unprincipled design choices and bolting on features after the fact. For example, <code>oneof</code> fields can’t be <code>repeated</code> because rather than resulting in a coproduct type, instead the code generator will give you a product of mutually-exclusive optional fields. Such a transformation is only valid for a singular field (and, as we’ll see later, not even then.)</p>
<p>The restriction behind <code>map</code> fields being unable to be <code>repeated</code> is related, but shows off a different limitation of the type-system. Behind the scenes, a <code>map&lt;k,v&gt;</code> is desugared into something spiritually similar to <code>repeated Pair&lt;k,v&gt;</code>. And because <code>repeated</code> is a magical language keyword rather than a type in its own right, it doesn’t compose with itself.</p>
<p>Your guess is as good as mine for why an <code>enum</code> can’t be used as a <code>map</code> key.</p>
<p>What’s so frustrating about all of this is a little understanding of how modern type-systems work would be enough to <em>drastically simplify</em> the protobuffer spec and simultaneously <em>remove all of the arbitrary restrictions.</em></p>
<p>The solution is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make all fields in a message <code>required</code>. This makes messages <em>product types</em>.</li>
<li>Promote <code>oneof</code> fields to instead be standalone data types. These are <em>coproduct types</em>.</li>
<li>Give the ability to parameterize product and coproduct types by other types.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it! These three features are all you need in order to define any possible piece of data. With these simpler pieces, we can re-implement the rest of the protobuffer spec in terms of them.</p>
<p>For example, we can rebuild <code>optional</code> fields:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1">product Unit <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2">  <span>// no fields</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4"></span>
<span id="cb1-5">coproduct Optional<span>&lt;</span>t<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6">  t    value <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb1-7">  Unit unset <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb1-8"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Building <code>repeated</code> fields is simple too:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1">coproduct List<span>&lt;</span>t<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2">  Unit empty <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3">  Pair<span>&lt;</span>t<span>,</span> List<span>&lt;</span>t<span>&gt;&gt;</span> cons <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Of course, the actual serialization logic is allowed to do something smarter than pushing linked-lists across the network—after all, <a href="https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/follow-the-denotation/">implementations and semantics don’t need to align one-to-one</a>.</p>
<h3 id="questionable-choices">Questionable Choices</h3>
<p>In the vein of Java, protobuffers make the distinction between <em>scalar</em> types and <em>message</em> types. Scalars correspond more-or-less to machine primitives—things like <code>int32</code>, <code>bool</code> and <code>string</code>. Messages, on the other hand, are everything else. All library- and user-defined types are messages.</p>
<p>The two varieties of types have completely different semantics, of course.</p>
<p>Fields with scalar types are always present. Even if you don’t set them. Did I mention that (at least in proto3<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>) all protobuffers can be zero-initialized with absolutely no data in them? Scalar fields get false-y values—<code>uint32</code> is initialized to <code>0</code> for example, and <code>string</code> is initialized as <code>""</code>.</p>
<p>It’s impossible to differentiate a field that was missing in a protobuffer from one that was assigned to the default value. Presumably this decision is in place in order to allow for an optimization of not needing to send default scalar values over the wire. Presumably, though the <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding">encoding guide</a> makes no mention of this optimization being performed, so your guess is as good as mine.</p>
<p>As we’ll see when we discuss protobuffers’ claim to being god’s gift to backwards- and forwards-compatible APIs, this inability to distinguish between unset and default values is a nightmare. Especially if indeed it’s a design decision made in order to save one bit (set or not) per field.</p>
<p>Contrast this behavior against message types. While scalar fields are dumb, the behavior for message fields is outright <em>insane.</em> Internally, message fields are either there or they’re not—but their behavior is crazy. Some pseudocode for their accessor is worth a thousand words. Pretend this is Java or something similar:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>private</span> Foo m_foo<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><span>public</span> Foo foo <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb3-4">  <span>// only if `foo` is used as an expression</span></span>
<span id="cb3-5">  get <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb3-6">    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>m_foo <span>!=</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span></span>
<span id="cb3-7">      <span>return</span> m_foo<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb3-8">    <span>else</span></span>
<span id="cb3-9">      <span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>Foo</span><span>();</span></span>
<span id="cb3-10">  <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb3-11"></span>
<span id="cb3-12">  <span>// instead if `foo` is used as an lvalue</span></span>
<span id="cb3-13">  mutable get <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb3-14">    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>m_foo <span>=</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span></span>
<span id="cb3-15">      m_foo <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Foo</span><span>();</span></span>
<span id="cb3-16">    <span>return</span> m_foo<span>;</span></span>
<span id="cb3-17">  <span>}</span></span>
<span id="cb3-18"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The idea is that if the <code>foo</code> field is unset, you’ll see a default-initialized copy whenever you ask for it, but won’t actually modify its container. But if you modify <code>foo</code>, it will modify its parent as well! All of this just to avoid using a <code>Maybe Foo</code> type and the associated “headaches” of the nuance behind needing to figure out what an unset value should mean.</p>
<p>This behavior is especially egregious, because it breaks a law! We’d expect the assignment <code>msg.foo = msg.foo;</code> to be a no-op. Instead the implementation will actually silently change <code>msg</code> to have a zero-initialized copy of <code>foo</code> if it previously didn’t have one.</p>
<p>Unlike scalar fields, at least it’s possible to detect if a message field is unset. Language bindings for protobuffers offer something along the lines of a generated <code>bool has_foo()</code> method. In the frequent case of copying a message field from one proto to another, iff it was present, you’ll need to write the following code:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>if</span> <span>(</span>src<span>.</span>has_foo<span>(</span>src<span>))</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2">  dst<span>.</span>set_foo<span>(</span>src<span>.</span>foo<span>());</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice that, at least in statically-typed languages, this pattern <em>cannot be abstracted</em> due to the nominal relationship between the methods <code>foo()</code>, <code>set_foo()</code> and <code>has_foo()</code>. Because all of these functions are their own <em>identifiers</em>, we have no means of programmatically generating them, save for a preprocessor macro:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>#define COPY_IFF_SET</span><span>(</span>src<span>,</span><span> </span>dst<span>,</span><span> </span>field<span>)</span><span> </span><span>\</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span>src<span>.</span><span>has_</span><span>##</span>field<span>(</span>src<span>))</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>\</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><span>  </span>dst<span>.</span><span>set_</span><span>##</span>field<span>(</span>src<span>.</span>field<span>());</span><span> </span><span>\</span></span>
<span id="cb5-4"><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>(but preprocessor macros are verboten by the <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Preprocessor_Macros">Google style guide</a>.)</p>
<p>If instead all optional fields were implemented as <code>Maybe</code>s, you’d get abstract-able, referentially transparent call-sites for free.</p>
<p>To change tack, let’s talk about another questionable decision. While you can define <code>oneof</code> fields in protobuffers, their semantics are <em>not</em> of coproduct types! Rookie mistake my dudes! What you get instead is an optional field for each case of the <code>oneof</code>, and magic code in the setters that will just unset any other case if this one is set.</p>
<p>At first glance, this seems like it should be semantically equivalent to having a proper union type. But instead it is an accursed, unutterable source of bugs! When this behavior teams up with the law-breaking implementation of <code>msg.foo = msg.foo;</code>, it allows this benign-looking assignment to silently delete arbitrary amounts of data!</p>
<p>What this means at the end of the day is that <code>oneof</code> fields do not form law-abiding <code>Prism</code>s, nor do messages form law-abiding <code>Lens</code>es. Which is to say good luck trying to write bug-free, non-trivial manipulations of protobuffers. It is <em>literally impossible to write generic, bug-free, polymorphic code over protobuffers.</em></p>
<p>That’s not the sort of thing anybody likes to hear, let alone those of us who have grown to love parametric polymorphism—which gives us the <em>exact opposite promise.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-lie-of-backwards--and-forwards-compatibility">The Lie of Backwards- and Forwards-Compatibility</h2>
<p>One of the frequently cited killer features of protobuffers is their “hassle-free ability to write backwards- and forwards-compatible APIs.” This is the claim that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.</p>
<p>What protobuffers are is <em>permissive.</em> They manage to not shit the bed when receiving messages from the past or from the future because they make absolutely no promises about what your data will look like. Everything is optional! But if you need it anyway, protobuffers will happily cook up and serve you something that typechecks, regardless of whether or not it’s meaningful.</p>
<p>This means that protobuffers achieve their promised time-traveling compatibility guarantees by <em>silently doing the wrong thing by default.</em> Of course, the cautious programmer can (and should) write code that performs sanity checks on received protobuffers. But if at every use-site you need to write defensive checks ensuring your data is sane, maybe that just means your deserialization step was too permissive. All you’ve managed to do is decentralize sanity-checking logic from a well-defined boundary and push the responsibility of doing it throughout your entire codebase.</p>
<p>One possible argument here is that protobuffers will hold onto any information present in a message that they don’t understand. In principle this means that it’s nondestructive to route a message through an intermediary that doesn’t understand this version of its schema. Surely that’s a win, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Granted, on paper it’s a cool feature. But I’ve never once seen an application that will actually preserve that property. With the one exception of routing software, nothing wants to inspect only some bits of a message and then forward it on unchanged. The vast majority of programs that operate on protobuffers will decode one, transform it into another, and send it somewhere else. Alas, these transformations are bespoke and coded by hand. And hand-coded transformations from one protobuffer to another don’t preserve unknown fields between the two, because it’s literally meaningless.</p>
<p>This pervasive attitude towards protobuffers always being compatible rears its head in other ugly ways. Style guides for protobuffers actively advocate against DRY and suggest inlining definitions whenever possible. The reasoning behind this is that it allows you to evolve messages separately if these definitions diverge in the future. To emphasize that point, the suggestion is to fly in the face of 60 years’ worth of good programming practice just in case <em>maybe</em> one day in the future you need to change something.</p>
<p>At the root of the problem is that Google conflates the meaning of data with its physical representation. When you’re at Google scale, this sort of thing probably makes sense. After all, they have an internal tool that allows you to compare the finances behind programmer hours vs network utilization vs the cost to store <span>\(x\)</span> bytes vs all sorts of other things. Unlike most companies in the tech space, paying engineers is one of Google’s smallest expenses. Financially it makes sense for them to waste programmers’ time in order to shave off a few bytes.</p>
<p>Outside of the top five tech companies, none of us is within five orders of magnitude of being Google scale. Your startup <em>cannot afford</em> to waste engineer hours on shaving off bytes. But shaving off bytes and wasting programmers’ time in the process is exactly what protobuffers are optimized for.</p>
<p>Let’s face it. You are not Google scale and you never will be. Stop cargo-culting technology just because “Google uses it” and therefore “it’s an industry best-practice.”</p>
<h2 id="protobuffers-contaminate-codebases">Protobuffers Contaminate Codebases</h2>
<p>If it were possible to restrict protobuffer usage to network-boundaries I wouldn’t be nearly as hard on it as a technology. Unfortunately, while there are a few solutions in principle, none of them is good enough to actually be used in real software.</p>
<p>Protobuffers correspond to the data you want to send over the wire, which is often <em>related</em> but not <em>identical</em> to the actual data the application would like to work with. This puts us in the uncomfortable position of needing to choose between one of three bad alternatives:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Maintain a separate type that describes the data you actually want, and ensure that the two evolve simultaneously.</li>
<li>Pack rich data into the wire format for application use.</li>
<li>Derive rich information every time you need it from a terse wire format.</li>
</ol>
<p>Option 1 is clearly the “right” solution, but its untenable with protobuffers. The language isn’t powerful enough to encode types that can perform double-duty as both wire and application formats. Which means you’d need to write a completely separate datatype, evolve it synchronously with the protobuffer, and <em>explicitly write serialization code between the two.</em> Seeing as most people seem to use protobuffers in order to not write serialization code, this is obviously never going to happen.</p>
<p>Instead, code that uses protobuffers allows them to proliferate throughout the codebase. True story, my main project at Google was a compiler that took “programs” written in one variety of protobuffer, and spit out an equivalent “program” in another. Both the input and output formats were expressive enough that maintaining proper parallel C++ versions of them could never possibly work. As a result, my code was unable to take advantage of any of the rich techniques we’ve discovered for writing compilers, because protobuffer data (and resulting code-gen) is simply too rigid to do anything interesting.</p>
<p>The result is that a thing that could have been 50 lines of <a href="https://github.com/passy/awesome-recursion-schemes">recursion schemes</a> was instead 10,000 lines of ad-hoc buffer-shuffling. The code I wanted to write was literally impossible when constrained by having protobuffers in the mix.</p>
<p>While this is an anecdote, it’s not in isolation. By virtue of their rigid code-generation, manifestations of protobuffers in languages are never idiomatic, nor can they be made to be—short of rewriting the code-generator.</p>
<p>But even then, you still have the problem of needing to embed a shitty type-system into the targeted language. Because most of protobuffers’ features are ill-conceived, these unsavory properties leak into our codebases. It means we’re forced to not only implement, but also use these bad ideas in any project which hopes to interface with protobuffers.</p>
<p>While it’s easy to implement inane things out of a solid foundation, going the other direction is challenging at best and the dark path of Eldrich madness at worst.</p>
<p>In short, abandon all hope ye who introduce protobuffers into your projects.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When done right, animations make an interface feel predictable, faster, and more enjoyable to use. They help you and your product stand out.</p>
<p>But they can also do the opposite. They can make an interface feel unpredictable, slow, and annoying. They can even make your users lose trust in your product.</p>
<p>So how do you know <em>when</em> and <em>how</em> to animate to improve the experience?</p>
<p>Step one is making sure your animations have a purpose.</p>
<a href="#purposeful-animations"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none"><path d="M10 19.0004L9.82843 19.1719C8.26634 20.734 5.73368 20.734 4.17158 19.1719L3.82843 18.8288C2.26634 17.2667 2.26633 14.734 3.82843 13.1719L7.17158 9.8288C8.73368 8.2667 11.2663 8.2667 12.8284 9.8288L13.1716 10.1719C13.8252 10.8256 14.2053 11.6491 14.312 12.5004" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path><path d="M9.68799 12.5004C9.79463 13.3516 10.1748 14.1752 10.8284 14.8288L11.1715 15.1719C12.7336 16.734 15.2663 16.734 16.8284 15.1719L20.1715 11.8288C21.7336 10.2667 21.7336 7.73404 20.1715 6.17194L19.8284 5.8288C18.2663 4.2667 15.7336 4.2667 14.1715 5.8288L14 6.00037" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"></path></svg><h2 id="purposeful-animations">Purposeful animations</h2></a>
<p>Before you start animating, ask yourself: what’s the purpose of this animation? <br>As an example, what’s the purpose of this marketing animation we built at Linear?</p>

<p>This animation explains how Product Intelligence (Linear’s feature) works. We could have used a static asset, but the animated version helps the user understand what this feature does, straight in the initial viewport of the page.</p>
<p>Another purposeful animation is this subtle scale down effect when pressing a button. It’s a small thing, but it helps the interface feel more alive and responsive.</p>

<p>Sonner’s enter animation, on the other hand, has two purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>-</span> <!-- -->Having a toast suddenly appear would feel off, so we animate it in.</li>
<li><span>-</span> <!-- -->Because it comes from and leaves in the same direction, it creates spatial consistency, making the swipe-down-to-dismiss gesture feel more intuitive.</li>
</ul>

<p>But sometimes the purpose of an animation might just be to bring delight.</p>
<p>Morphing of the feedback component below helps make the experience more unique and memorable. This works as long as the user will rarely interact with it. It’ll then become a pleasant surprise, rather than a daily annoyance.</p>
<div><p>Press on the button to see it morph.</p></div>
<p>Used multiple times a day, this component would quickly become irritating. The initial delight would fade and the animation would slow users down.</p>
<p>How often users will see an animation is a key factor in deciding whether to animate or not. Let’s dive deeper into it next.</p>

<p>I use Raycast hundreds of times a day. If it animated every time I opened it, it would be <em>very</em> annoying. But there’s no animation at all. That’s the optimal experience.</p>
<p>To see it for yourself, try to toggle the open state of the menu below by <span>using the buttons below</span><span>pressing <code>J</code> and then <code>K</code></span>. Which one feels better if used hundreds of times a day?</p>

<p>When I open Raycast, I have a clear goal in mind. I don’t expect to be “delighted”, I don’t need to be. I just want to do my work with no unnecessary friction.</p>
<p>Think about what the user wants to achieve and how often they will see an animation. A hover effect is nice, but if used multiple times a day, it would likely benefit the most from having no animation at all.</p>
<p><span><div><p>Imagine you interact with this list often during the day.</p></div></span>

<p><span><p>Since we can’t really use a keyboard on touch devices, you can press the buttons below to see how it feels with and without animation.</p></span>

<p>But even if your animation won’t be used too often and it fulfills a clear purpose, you still have to think about its speed…</p>

<p>Unless you are working on marketing sites, your animations <em>have</em> to be fast. They improve the perceived performance of your app, stay connected to user’s actions, and make the interface feel as if it’s truly listening to the user.</p>
<p>To give you an example, a faster-spinning spinner makes the app seem to load faster, even though the load time is the same. This improves perceived performance.</p>
<div><p>Which one works harder to load the data?</p></div>
<p>A <code>180ms</code> dropdown animation feels more responsive than a <code>400ms</code> one:</p>
<div><p>Click on the buttons to compare the speed.</p></div>
<p>As a rule of thumb, UI animations should generally stay under <code>300ms</code>.</p>
<p>Another example of the importance of speed: tooltips should have a slight delay before appearing to prevent accidental activation. Once a tooltip is open however, hovering over other tooltips should open them with no delay and no animation.</p>
<p>This feels faster without defeating the purpose of the initial delay.</p>

<p>The goal is not to animate for animation’s sake, it’s to build great user interfaces. The ones that users will happily use, even on a daily basis. Sometimes this requires animations, but sometimes the best animation is no animation.</p>
<p>Knowing when to animate is just one of many things you need to know in order to craft great animations. If you’d like to dive deeper into the theory and practice of it, I’ve created a course that covers everything you need to know:</p>

You can vibe code a successful product without any technical skills. Here's one example."</em></p></blockquote><p>I liked the challenge, especially since it referenced a source. What I thought would be a short comment evolved into a series of articles.</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://pawelbrodzinski.substack.com/p/vibe-coded-product-success-stories" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Vibe-Coded Product Success Stories Ain't What They Look</a><span> covered the marketing/PR part of the story (and the holes in it).</span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://pawelbrodzinski.substack.com/p/vibe-coding-doesnt-replace-tech-skills" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Vibe Coding Doesn't Replace Tech Skills; It Requires More of Them</a><span> focused on technical challenges triggered by vibe coding.</span></p></li></ul><p>This post is the last one (or at least I believe so at the time of writing), and I will focus on the product management side. Well, just one aspect of it.</p><p><strong>The perception that the pace of shipping features (or building in general) is the bottleneck of product development is a misconception.</strong></p><p>Ultimately, that's what vibe coding tools offer: we can build it for you with no engineering team whatsoever. In fact, the original challenge was worded along the same lines:</p><blockquote><p><em><span>"I'm working with people and I've seen others, who only used AI to create a valid tech business, scaling it up beyond a million dollars, </span><strong>before they hired any software engineer.</strong><span>"</span></em></p></blockquote><p>Let’s unpack it, then.</p><p><span>I'm a fan of vibe coding when it comes to prototyping. </span><a href="https://pawelbrodzinski.substack.com/p/role-of-vibe-coding-in-product-validation" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">It is a fabulous tool to learn whether what we ideate is desirable.</a><span> </span><strong>The first thing about prototypes, though? They are </strong><em><strong>disposable</strong></em><strong>.</strong></p><p><span>Even if we validate that we were right and our idea works (</span><a href="https://pawelbrodzinski.substack.com/p/90-of-times-validation-means-invalidation" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">which happens maybe once every ten attempts</a><span>), the prototype is still </span><em>disposable</em><span>.</span></p><p>The whole idea behind prototyping is that we trade quality for a quick and cheap outcome. It can break. It can be buggy. Sometimes it may even look ugly. The point is: it conveys the idea.</p><p>Conversely, a product has to deliver promised value sustainably over time. Awful UX? I'll move to an alternative. Bugs too annoying? I'll stop using it altogether. It breaks entirely? Why would I use it, let alone pay for it?</p><p>The quality has to be there. Otherwise, customers will go as fast as they come, and that's not a viable product strategy. Sure, we'd still love to build our product quickly and cheaply, but at some level, quality is non-negotiable. Ultimately, we need the thing to work in the long run.</p><p>How do most successful digital products take their shape? Consider any example of your choice and try to reverse-engineer their path. Do you see a clear way, going from one milestone to another, each step an inevitable consequence of all the previous ones?</p><p>Like Amazon figuring out online bookselling as the hit of the internet era, and then, inevitably, taking a shot at music, video, and other industries, while concurrently launching in non-US markets?</p><p>Expanding to include third-party sellers must have been a logical next step, right? And building the biggest cloud infrastructure, their own reading device, and video streaming business... well, by this point, we’re retrofitting the connections and we know it.</p><p><span>Amazon tried a lot of things to land with its key cash cows today. Heck, even with their foundational idea—the marketplace—they famously run thousands of experiments all the time. In fact, </span><a href="https://graphite.dev/blog/how-amazon-deploys-code" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">their whole development culture is designed around rapid experimentation</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>In other words, we never know upfront what will work in a product. </span><strong>We try stuff, see what works, stick with what does, drop what does not.</strong></p><p><a href="https://paulbuchheit.blogspot.com/2009/01/communicating-with-code.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Paul Buchheit is famous for building the first GMail prototype in just a few hours. And then repeating the trick with AdSense.</a><span> All in times where all code had to be manually written, like, you know, by hand.</span></p><p>Yes, we’re talking about two of Google’s product slam dunks. Yet, if you read the story carefully, it was anything but an execution of a well-laid plan.</p><blockquote><p><em><span>"We did </span><strong>a lot of things wrong during the 2.5 years</strong><span> of pre-launch Gmail development."</span></em></p><p><em><span>"We </span><strong>re-wrote the frontend about six times and the backend three times</strong><span> by launch."</span></em></p><p><em><span>"I would just write the code, release the feature, and watch the response. Usually, </span><strong>everyone (including me) would end up hating whatever it was</strong><span> (especially my ideas), but we always learned something from the experience, and we were able to quickly move on to other ideas."</span></em></p><p>Paul Buchheit</p></blockquote><p><span>In other words, there have been numerous dead ends that they explored, invalidated, and moved on from. </span><em>There's no knowing up front.</em></p><p>The same pattern applies to products, not just product features. As an example, we can stick with Google. It is known for a swath of products in line with its mission to organize the world's information. Search, Gmail, Google Workspace, and what have you.</p><p>However, aside from the search, many of these products originated as experiments. Gmail and AdSense, mentioned above, are two notable examples.</p><p>However, for each product idea that survived the test of time, there are a dozen that did not. And for each of the latter, there are probably an order of magnitude more that weren't even released to the public.</p><p><span>I personally used and loved </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Google Reader</a><span>, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Talk" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Google Talk</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picasa" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Picasa</a><span>, and the retirement of each broke my heart. There are a few more I didn't cry over, despite being an active user till their sad end.</span></p><p><span>Probably everyone remembers Google's biggest lost bets: </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Buzz" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Buzz</a><span>, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%2B" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Google+</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Wave" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Google Wave</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>By the end of 2024, </span><a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">the full list of things that Google retired had almost 300 entries</a><span>. It’s not a track record peppered with home runs, is it? And that’s for a company that, from the vantage point of an aspiring startup, has unlimited capabilities.</span></p><p>With all the engineering power Google has, the pace of development could have been set arbitrarily high for any of these products. While no official information is available, it's been rumored that Google had a few hundred engineers working on Google+ alone.</p><p>If the pace of development were all that counted, it would always be the incumbents who would win the product race in any niche. After all, they can pump as much engineering firepower as they want, leveraging their existing revenue streams, customer bases, and whatnot.</p><p>And we know it doesn't work this way.</p><p>Product development, in essence, is continuous discovery. First, we aim to validate the idea, then we switch to validating whether any given change brings us closer to our goals—growth, revenue, retention, or whatever that may be.</p><p><span>The problem is that validation takes time. </span><a href="https://substack.com/@leahtharin" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Leah Tharin</a><span>, who shares her story about </span><a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-170083802" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">working on products with tens of millions of users</a><span>, says the following.</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>"The bottleneck of the team was </span><strong>waiting for statistical significance for most of our experiments</strong><span>, despite all the traffic we had. (...) If we changed a copy of our main website or most prominent tools, the experiments were statistically significant within hours. A more complex down the funnel change for higher value customers? </span><strong>Weeks, sometimes months.</strong><span> Ugh."</span></em></p><p>Leah Tharin</p></blockquote><p>Weeks. Sometimes months. That's before they could have learned whether the change was for the better, worse, or had no effect at all.</p><p><span>Let's make a thought experiment and assume they could reduce the cost and time of </span><em>development</em><span> by a factor of 10. Would they grow faster? Save for the simplest tweaks on the landing page, they would still need to wait to learn the outcomes.</span></p><p>And it's not like they could improve the volume of experiments by tenfold either. Sure, it's technically feasible. Except it would make a mess out of the metrics.</p><p><em>"So we're running these 27 concurrent experiments to improve retention, and the data says it's been better for a week and then got back to what we had before. What does it say about those experiments again?"</em></p><p><span>If you look at what actually matters (growth, revenue, retention), knowing the right thing to build is the most common bottleneck. </span><em>And we can't reliably know what will work from the outset.</em></p><p>But what if we do know exactly what to build? Ultimately, it's the basic pattern of project work. We define the scope, we agree on the payment, and off we go!</p><p>In such a setup, we can conveniently ignore that we might be building the wrong thing entirely. Or, with a bit of luck, it's one of the rather rare cases where we either run a direct replacement project or automate the existing business, and we have a much better initial understanding of the desirability, viability, and feasibility of the idea.</p><p>Still, it's not the development pace that makes or breaks such endeavors.</p><p>At Lunar Logic, when estimating work for a client we've never worked with before, we always go with a wide range. Not as wide as we'd like, as to be brutally honest, we'd need to go with something like "It can take less than a month, or more than a quarter." Still, the bracket is uncomfortably wide for many of our potential customers.</p><p>And that for the work with limited technical uncertainties.</p><p>Why are we all over the place? Can’t we just use 20 years of experience that we so often brag about and tell in plain English how much it will cost? No, we can’t. We don’t yet know how collaboration will look, and that factor alone will sway the actual costs more than anything directly related to the scope. </p><p><span>Poor communication creates rework. It's not unusual that </span><a href="https://brodzinski.com/2025/08/most-underestimated-factor-estimation.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">the quality of communication, or rather lack thereof, adds as much as an additional 100% to the effort</a><span>.</span></p><p>That compounds with the development of all unnecessary features. If you look at such a gig in hindsight, the value-adding work may stack up to just several percent of the whole effort.</p><p><span>Adding development speed would only exacerbate the problem. </span><em>The cost of rework doesn't pile up linearly.</em><span> Once you rework the rework, it's like a compound interest rate, except in reverse. Go figure what it does to the costs.</span></p><p><span>One of the many excellent observations Daniel Kahneman explains in his seminal book&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a><span>&nbsp;is the following.</span></p><blockquote><p><em>"This is the essence of intuitive heuristics: when faced with a difficult question, we often answer an easier one instead, usually without noticing the substitution."</em></p><p>Daniel Kahneman</p></blockquote><p>We subconsciously avoid solving difficult problems by finding a similar one that's much easier to address. Then, we pretend the answer to the latter works as the answer to the former.</p><p>In that manner, we respond to the question about successful product development. We have little clue about what makes products successful. However, we certainly see that the most significant part of the effort is development. It takes a great deal of time and money to turn an idea into a product.</p><p>So we focus on the speed of development. And suddenly, we have an easy answer. We can make it faster. How? That's simple.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>For those worried that AI is going to disrupt their jobs, OpenAI has the solution – take its certification and use a newly announced jobs board to find a new role.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Fidji Simo, OpenAI's head of applications (and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/08/openai_apps_chif_instacart/">former</a> CEO of Instacart), announced the plan for workers to advertise themselves to the company's customers for new jobs. She said that while AI is going to shake up the employment market, who better to solve that problem than the people doing the shaking?</p>
<p>"AI will be disruptive. Jobs will look different, companies will have to adapt, and all of us – from shift workers to CEOs – will have to learn how to work in new ways," she said in a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://openai.com/index/expanding-economic-opportunity-with-ai/">blog post</a>.</p>

    

<p>"At OpenAI, we can't eliminate that disruption. But what we can do is help more people become fluent in AI and connect them with companies that need their skills, to give people more economic opportunities."</p>

        


        

<p>Simo's plan is that workers should take courses in tech literacy at its <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://academy.openai.com/">OpenAI Academy</a> and then advertise themselves on a forthcoming jobs platform. She said the company has already signed up some big names to the scheme, although maybe the choice of Walmart as an early adopter might not encourage IT admins in their future career paths.</p>
<p>OpenAI declined to comment further on the plans.</p>

        

<p>"At Walmart, we know the future of retail won't be defined by technology alone – it will be defined by people who know how to use it," Walmart US CEO John Furner said in a canned statement.</p>
<p>"By bringing AI training directly to our associates, we're putting the most powerful technology of our time in their hands – giving them the skills to rewrite the playbook and shape the future of retail."</p>

</ul>
<p>The OpenAI Academy has had some big-name sign-ups, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gatech.edu/news/2025/03/27/georgia-tech-leads-way-ai-literacy-openai-academy-collaboration">particularly</a> the respected computer science teachers at Georgia Tech, but Simo says that the business is pushing hard to build on a White House plan to make AI a core skill for American workers – so long as the engines they use aren't <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/24/white_house_wants_no_woke_ai/">too woke</a>.</p>
<p>What Simo didn't mention directly is that getting into the jobs market would bring the company into competition with Microsoft, one of its biggest backers. LinkedIn is the primary Western jobs site and OpenAI setting up a competitor might get in the way of cordial relations.</p>
<p>Microsoft had no comment on the matter, but OpenAI appears to be only scooping the AI cream, and whatever else floats to the top of the market, on its proposed employment register. There's also the question of whether or not the skills OpenAI is shilling will have any validity in the actual jobs market.</p>

        

<p>Meanwhile, CEO Sam Altman and most of the tech glitterati attended <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5485218-trump-host-tech-ceos-rose-garden/">a dinner</a> hosted by First Lady Melania Trump to discuss AI last night.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content-parent"><h2 id="heading-beginnings">Beginnings</h2>
<p>I'm old enough to remember when Vagrant looked like a promised land where every development environment would look the same. Differences between language versions, as well as some unusual OS version differences, resulted in a few days of unproductive debugging of your development environment. I've had similar excitement when I started my first Docker Swarm (who uses that these days?!) - it felt revolutionary. Docker wasn't just a tool - it fundamentally changed how we thought about application development and deployment. Having a repeatable, separated environment from your local system was refreshing and looked like a superpower. It has become a must-have tool for every engineer. "<em>Just Dockerize it</em>" became my go-to solution for pretty much everything. Sure, architecture or defining a new Docker image could be a bit finicky at times, but hey, that's just how things worked. Is the persistent dockerd daemon eating upresources in the background with root privileges, just the price of doing business? I thought so.</p>
<p>If you are in this industry long enough, there is one pattern that emerges every day. Everybody begins questioning the "that's just how it's done" mentality. Along the way, the quiet Docker daemon running in the background felt less like a comfortable constant and more like a ticking bomb. More and more ways to explore this vulnerability emerged:</p>
<p><strong>2019-02-11 - CVE-2019-5736 (runC container escape):</strong> lets a process in a container overwrite the host’s runc binary → full host compromise if exploited.</p>
<p><strong>2022-03-07 - CVE-2022-0847 “Dirty Pipe” (Linux kernel):</strong> read-only file overwrite in kernel; practical container-to-host abuse scenarios documented by Docker/Sysdig. </p>
<p><strong>2022-03-07 - CVE-2022-0492 (cgroups v1 release_agent):</strong> privilege escalation / container escape via cgroups v1; mitigations via seccomp/AppArmor/SELinux. </p>
<p><strong>2024-01-31 - CVE-2024-21626 (runC “Leaky Vessels”):</strong> fd leak + process.cwd issues enabling host FS access and potential escape; fixed in runC <strong>1.1.12</strong> (Docker Engine ≥ <strong>25.0.2</strong>). </p>
<p><strong>2024-02-01 - CVE-2024-23651/23652/23653 (BuildKit, “Leaky Vessels”):</strong> build-time issues that can affect host files; fixed in BuildKit <strong>0.12.5</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>2024-09-23 - In-the-wild cryptojacking campaign:</strong> attackers targeted exposed Docker APIs and microservices. </p>
<p><strong>2024-10-01 - Docker API swarm botnet campaign:</strong> cryptojacking via exposed Docker Engine API (<a target="_blank" href="https://securitylabs.datadoghq.com/articles/threat-actors-leveraging-docker-swarm-kubernetes-mine-cryptocurrency/">details</a>).</p>
<p>I had been seeking an alternative (I assumed that someone had already questioned the status quo), and that's how I stumbled into Podman territory. It began as casual curiosity - "<em>Hey, let me check out this thing</em>" - turned into a complete overhaul of my container workflows and pulled me into using Fedora in my home lab. And honestly? I wish I'd made the switch sooner.</p>
<h2 id="heading-daemonless">Daemonless</h2>
<p>Here's the fundamental issue that kept me awake: Docker's entire architecture is built around a persistent background service - the dockerd daemon. Whenever you run a docker command, you're actually talking to this daemon, which then does the heavy lifting. Sounds about right?</p>
<p>Yes?!</p>
<p>Or rather NO, because this daemon runs with root privileges. Always. And if something goes south with a daemon - innocent bug, a crash, or worst case scenario, a security exploit - your entire container ecosystem is potentially compromised. Not just the containers, daemon, or resource that you assigned to it, but the whole host system. It was a huge relief that Podman threw this model out the window. No daemon, no processes running in the background. When you run <code>podman run my-app</code>, the container becomes a direct child of your command. And it is running under your user privileges. Simple architecture change with huge implications:</p>

<p>Remember those late-night security advisories about Docker daemon vulnerabilities (ex., when dockerd was misconfigured to listen on TCP:2375 without TLS, attackers could spin up privileged containers remotely)? With Podman, even if someone somehow escalates privileges inside a container to root level, they're still just an unprivileged user on the actual host. It significantly reduces the surface of an attack.</p>
<h3 id="heading-no-more-single-points-of-failure">No more single points of failure:</h3>
<p>Usually Docker daemon runs just fine. But when hiccups kick in - oh boy, hold your hats, as it will take down multiple containers at once. With Podman when one container crashed, the other kept running like nothing happened. It makes so much sense, and it's built in the spirit of hermetization.</p>
<h3 id="heading-lighter-resource-footprint">Lighter resource footprint:</h3>
<p>I had been surprised when my MacBook M2 Pro started to get warmer when left unattended. After a brief investigation (with Activity Monitor), it was obvious - Docker never knows when to stop. No constantly running daemon means less memory usage. Unfortunately, running a container using Podman can be a different story (ekhm: <a href="https://blog.podman.io/2025/06/podman-and-apple-rosetta/" target="_blank">blog.podman.io/2025/06/podman-and-apple-ros..</a>) - yet the thing is getting better: <a href="https://blog.podman.io/2025/08/podman-5-6-released-rosetta-status-update/" target="_blank">blog.podman.io/2025/08/podman-5-6-released-..</a>.</p>
<h2 id="heading-where-podman-really-shines">Where Podman Really Shines</h2>
<p>Beyond the obvious daemon advantages, Podman brings some genuinely clever features that make day-to-day container work more pleasant:</p>
<p><strong>Systemd integration that doesn't suck:</strong> This one's huge if you're working on Linux servers (most of us are). Podman justgenerates proper systemd unit files. Boom, your container is a first-class citizen in the Linux service ecosystem. Boot dependencies, automatic restarts, resource limits - it all just works. I can run <code>podman generate systemd --name my-app</code> and get a clean service file. Afterwards, I can enable, start, stop, and monitor with standard systemctl commands. Say bye-bye to third-party process managers.</p>
<p><strong>Kubernetes alignment that's not just marketing:</strong> Since Red Hat (the folks behind Podman) is also a major Kubernetes contributor, the tool feels like it was designed with K8s in mind from day one. The native pod support isn't just a bolt-on feature - it's central to how Podman works. I do not need to run k3s or any local substitute for Kubernetes. Now, I can prototype multi-container applications as Podman pods locally. Then I just generate Kubernetes YAML directly from those pods with podman generate kube. My local development environment actually looks like what I'm going to deploy. This was revolutionary when I had to take over the responsibility of managing and developing a quite complex cluster.</p>
<p><strong>The Unix philosophy done right:</strong> Instead of trying to be everything to everyone, Podman focuses on running containers well and delegates specialized tasks to purpose - built tools. Need to build images with fine - grained control? That's Buildah. Want to inspect or copy images between registries? Skopeo's your friend. I can use the best tool for each job. I'm no longer stuck with whatever image-building quirks Docker decides to implement.</p>
<h2 id="heading-the-migration-that-wasnt-really-a-migration">The Migration That Wasn't Really a Migration</h2>
<p>Here's the part that surprised me most: switching from Docker to Podman was almost seamless. The Podman folks clearly understood that creating the next standard would not let them win the market, and they just adhered to the known CLI tool. I literally just aliased <code>docker=podman</code> in my shell and carried on with life. <code>podman run, podman build, podman ps</code> - they all behave exactly like their Docker counterparts. My existing Dockerfiles worked without modification. My muscle memory didn't need retraining.</p>
<p>Though there were a few places where I did hit differences that were actually improvements in disguise:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Privileged ports in rootless mode not working? Good! That's security working as intended. A reverse proxy setup is a better architecture anyway.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some volume permission quirks? Yes - but it's a small price, and again - if you do it right, you are limiting the scope of possible attack.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A few legacy tools that expected the Docker socket? If there is no support by now, just remember that Podman can expose a Docker-compatible API if needed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If your Docker Compose workflow is overly complex, just convert it to Kubernetes YAML. We all use Kubernetes these days, so why even bother about this? Having the same layout for development and production is a huge bonus of doing so.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="heading-the-real-world-difference">The Real-World Difference</h2>
<p>After six months of running Podman in production, here's what I've noticed:</p>
<p>I'm sleeping much better. Because I'm personally responsible for security, I do not have to check if every container is running in rootless mode. Something that I did not think I would benefit from is that my monitoring dashboards show cleaner resource usage patterns. Don't get me wrong - Docker isn't going anywhere. It has massive momentum, a mature ecosystem, and plenty of organizational inertia keeping it in place. But for new projects, or if you are able to make technical decisions based on merit rather than legacy, Podman represents a clear evolution in container technology. More secure by design, more aligned with Linux system management practices, and more thoughtfully architected for the way we actually deploy containers in 2025. The best way forward is to question the assumptions you didn't even realize you were making.</p>
<h2 id="heading-fastapi-migration-guide-from-docker-to-podman">FastAPI Migration Guide: From Docker to Podman</h2>
<p>Just to prove how easy transition can be, here's a practical walkthrough of migrating a FastAPI application from Docker to Podman.  </p>
<h3 id="heading-what-youll-need">What You'll Need</h3>
<p>Your existing FastAPI project with its Dockerfile and requirements.txt</p>
<p>Podman is installed on your system:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install podman</p>
</li>
<li><p>Fedora/RHEL: sudo dnf install podman</p>
</li>
<li><p>macOS: Grab Podman Desktop for a GUI experience</p>
</li>
<li><p>Windows: If you are not a C# developer - stop doing this to yourself and just use Linux: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_RqZG6YR5M" target="_blank">youtube.com/watch?v=S_RqZG6YR5M</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="heading-step-1-your-dockerfile-probably-just-works">Step 1: Your Dockerfile Probably Just Works</h3>
<p>This is the beautiful part—Podman uses the same OCI container format as Docker. Your existing Dockerfile should work without any changes. Here's a typical FastAPI setup:</p>
<pre><code>FROM python:3.10-slim-buster

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 8000

CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
</code></pre>
<h3 id="heading-step-2-build-your-image">Step 2: Build Your Image</h3>
<p>Instead of docker build, just run:</p>
<pre><code>podman build -t my-fastapi-app:latest .
</code></pre>
<p>That's it. Same flags, same behavior, same output. If you want to ease the transition, create an alias:</p>
<pre><code><span>alias</span> docker=podman
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can use your existing docker build commands without thinking about it.</p>
<h3 id="heading-step-3-run-your-container">Step 3: Run Your Container</h3>
<p>For development and testing:</p>
<pre><code>podman run --rm -p 8000:8000 --name my-fastapi-container my-fastapi-app:latest
</code></pre>
<p>For background services:</p>
<pre><code>podman run -d -p 8000:8000 --name my-fastapi-container my-fastapi-app:latest
</code></pre>
<p>Your app should be accessible at <a href="http://localhost:8000/" target="_blank">localhost:8000</a> just like before.</p>
<p><strong>Important note:</strong> <em>By default, Podman runs in rootless mode. This is a security win, but it means you can't bind directly to privileged ports (below 1024). For production, you'll want a reverse proxy anyway, so this pushes you toward better architecture.</em></p>
<h3 id="heading-step-4-production-deployment-with-systemd">Step 4: Production Deployment with Systemd</h3>
<p>This is where Podman really shines. Instead of wrestling with custom service management, generate a proper systemd unit file:</p>
<pre><code><span># First, make sure your container is running</span>

podman run -d -p 8000:8000 --name my-fastapi-container my-fastapi-app:latest

<span># Generate the systemd service file</span>

mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user/

podman generate systemd --name my-fastapi-container &gt; ~/.config/systemd/user/my-fastapi-container.service

<span># Enable and start the service</span>

systemctl --user daemon-reload

systemctl --user <span>enable</span> my-fastapi-container.service

systemctl --user start my-fastapi-container.service
</code></pre>
<p>Now your FastAPI app is managed like any other system service. It'll start on boot, restart on failure, and integrate with standard Linux logging and monitoring tools.</p>
<p>For server deployments where you want the service to persist even when you're not logged in:</p>
<p>loginctl enable-linger $(whoami)</p>
<h3 id="heading-step-5-multi-service-applications-with-pods">Step 5: Multi-Service Applications with Pods</h3>
<p>If your FastAPI app needs a database or other services, Podman's pod concept is cleaner than Docker Compose for simple setups:</p>
<pre><code><span># Create a pod that shares networking</span>
podman pod create --name my-fastapi-pod -p 8000:8000 -p 5432:5432

<span># Run your FastAPI app in the pod</span>

podman run -d --pod my-fastapi-pod --name fastapi-app my-fastapi-app:latest

<span># Run PostgreSQL in the same pod</span>

podman run -d --pod my-fastapi-pod --name postgres-db -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword postgres:13
</code></pre>
<p>Now your FastAPI app can reach PostgreSQL at localhost:5432 because they share the same network namespace.</p>
<h3 id="heading-step-6-docker-compose-compatibility">Step 6: Docker Compose Compatibility</h3>
<p>For existing Docker Compose setups, you have options:</p>
<p><strong>Option 1:</strong> Use podman-compose as a drop-in replacement:</p>
<pre><code>pip install podman-compose

podman-compose up -d
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Option 2:</strong> Convert to Kubernetes YAML for a more cloud-native approach:</p>
<pre><code><span># Install kompose first</span>

kompose convert -f docker-compose.yml -o k8s-manifest.yaml

podman play kube k8s-manifest.yaml
</code></pre>
<p>This second option is particularly nice if you're planning to deploy to Kubernetes eventually.</p>
<p><strong>Common Gotchas and Solutions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Volume permissions:</strong> If you hit permission issues with mounted volumes, remember that rootless containers run as your user. Make sure your user owns the directories you're mounting:</p>
<pre><code>chown -R $(id -un):$(id -gn) /path/to/your/data
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Legacy tooling:</strong> Some tools expect the Docker socket at /var/run/docker.sock. Podman can provide a compatible API:</p>
<pre><code>systemctl --user <span>enable</span> podman.socket

systemctl --user start podman.socket

<span>export</span> DOCKER_HOST=unix://<span>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</span>/podman/podman.sock
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Performance tuning:</strong> For production workloads, you might want to tune the rootless networking stack or consider running specific containers in rootful mode for maximum performance.</p>
<p>The migration process is usually much smoother than people expect. Start with a development environment, get comfortable with the workflow differences, then gradually move production workloads. The security and operational benefits make it worth the effort.</p>

<h3 id="transcript">TRANSCRIPT</h3>

<h2 id="000003">00:00:03</h2>
<h2 id="ron">Ron</h2>
<p>Welcome to Signals and Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech
stack, from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky. It is my great pleasure to have Chris Lattner on
the show. Typically on Signals and Threads, we end up talking to engineers who work here
at Jane Street, but sometimes we like to grab outside folk, and Chris is an amazing figure
to bring on because he’s been so involved in a bunch of really foundational pieces of
computing that we all use—LLVM, and Clang, and MLIR, and OpenCL, and Swift, and now
Mojo. And this has happened at a bunch of different storied institutions—Apple, and Tesla,
and Google, and SiFive, and now Modular. So anyway, it’s a pleasure to have you joining
us, Chris.</p>

<h2 id="000043">00:00:43</h2>
<h2 id="chris">Chris</h2>
<p>Thank you, Ron. I’m so happy to be here.</p>

<h2 id="000045">00:00:45</h2>
<h2 id="ron-1">Ron</h2>
<p>I guess I want to start by just hearing a little bit more about your origin story. How did
you get into computing and how did you get into this world of both compiler engineering
and programming language design?</p>

<h2 id="000054">00:00:54</h2>
<h2 id="chris-1">Chris</h2>
<p>So I grew up in the ’80s and back before computers were really a thing. We had PCs, but
they weren’t considered cool. And so I fell in love with understanding how the computer
worked. And back then, things were way simpler. I started with a BASIC interpreter, for
example, and you’d get a book from the store. Remember when we had books? [laughs] And
you’d learn things from books?</p>

<h2 id="000114">00:01:14</h2>
<h2 id="ron-2">Ron</h2>
<p>Did you do the thing where you’d get the hobbyist magazine and copy out the listing of the
program?</p>

<h2 id="000119">00:01:19</h2>
<h2 id="chris-2">Chris</h2>
<p>That’s exactly right. And so we didn’t have vibe coding, but we did have books. And so
just by typing things in, you could understand how things work, and then when you broke
it—because inevitably you’re typing something in and you don’t really know what you’re
doing—you have to figure out what went wrong and so it encouraged a certain amount of
debugging. I really love computer games. Again, back then, things were a little bit
simpler. Computer games drove graphics and performance and things like this. And so I
spent some time on these things called bulletin board systems and the early internet
reading about how game programmers are trying to push the limits of the hardware. And so
that’s where I got interested in performance and computers and systems. I went on to
college and had an amazing professor at my school, shout out to University of Portland in
Portland, Oregon, and he was a compiler nerd.</p>

<p>And so, I think that his love for compilers was infectious. His name was Steven Vegdahl,
and that caused me to go on to pursue compilers at University of Illinois. And there
again, continue to fall down this rabbit hole of compilers and systems, and build
LLVM. And ever since I got into the compiler world, I loved it. I love compilers because
they’re large-scale systems, there’s multiple different components that all work
together. And in the university setting, it was really cool in the compiler class, because
unlike most of the assignments where you do an assignment, turn it in, forget about it—in
compilers, you would do an assignment, turn it in, get graded, and then build on it. And
it felt much more realistic like software engineering, rather than just doing a project to
get graded.</p>

<h2 id="000235">00:02:35</h2>
<h2 id="ron-3">Ron</h2>
<p>Yeah, I think for a lot of people, the OS class is their first real experience of doing a
thing where you really are building layer on top of layer. I think it’s an incredibly
important experience for people as they start engineering.</p>

<h2 id="000244">00:02:44</h2>
<h2 id="chris-3">Chris</h2>
<p>It’s also one where you get to use some of those data structures. I took this, almost
academic, here’s what a binary tree is, and here’s what a graph is. And particularly when
I went through it, it was taught from a very math-forward perspective, but it really made
it useful. And so that was actually really cool. I’m like, ‘Oh, this is why I learned this
stuff.’</p>

<h2 id="000259">00:02:59</h2>
<h2 id="ron-4">Ron</h2>
<p>So one thing that strikes me about your career is that you’ve ended up going back and
forth between compiler engineering and language design space, whereas I feel like a lot of
people are on one side or the other—they’re mostly compilers people and they don’t care
that much about the language, and just, how do we make this thing go fast? And there are
some people who are really focusing on language design and the work on the compiler is a
secondary thing towards that design. And you’ve both popped back and forth. And then also
a lot of your compiler engineering work, really starting with LLVM, in some sense is
itself, very language-forward. With LLVM, there’s a language in there that’s this
intermediate language that you’re surfacing as a tool for people to use. So I’m just
curious to hear more about how you think about the back and forth between compiler
engineering and language design.</p>

<h2 id="000339">00:03:39</h2>
<h2 id="chris-4">Chris</h2>
<p>The reason I do this is that effectively, my career is following my own interests. And so
my interests are not static. I want to work on different kinds of problems and solve
useful problems and build into things. And so the more technology and capability you have,
the higher you can reach. And so with LLVM, for example, built and learned a whole bunch
of cool stuff about deep code generation for an X86 chip and that category of technology
with register allocation, stuff like this. But then it made it possible to go, say, let’s
go tackle C++ and let’s go use this to build the world’s best implementation of something
that lots more people use and understand than deep backend code generation technology. And
then with Swift, it was, build even higher and say, ‘Okay, well C++, maybe some people
like it, but I think we can do better and let’s reach higher.’ I’ve also been involved in
AI systems, been involved in building an iPad app to help teach kids how to code. And so,
lots of different things over time. And so for me, the place I think I’m most useful and
where a lot of my experience is valuable ends up being at this hardware-software boundary.</p>

<h2 id="000436">00:04:36</h2>
<h2 id="ron-5">Ron</h2>
<p>I’m curious how you ended up making the leap to working on Swift. From my perspective,
Swift looks from the outside, like one of these points of arrival in mainstream
programming contexts of a bunch of ideas that I have long thought are really great ideas
in other programming languages. And I’m curious, in some ways a step away from like, oh,
I’m going to work on really low-level stuff and compiler optimization, and then we will go
much higher level and do a C++ implementation, which is still a pretty low level. How did
the whole Swift thing happen?</p>

<h2 id="000500">00:05:00</h2>
<h2 id="chris-5">Chris</h2>
<p>Great question. I mean, the timeframe for people that aren’t familiar is that LLVM started
in 2000. So by 2005, I had exited university and I joined Apple. And so LLVM was an
advanced research project at that point. By the 2010 timeframe, LLVM was much more mature
and we had just shipped C++ support in Clang, and so it could bootstrap itself, which
means the compiler could compile itself. It’s all written in C++, it could build advanced
libraries like the Boost template library, which is super crazy advanced template
stuff. And so the C++ implementation that I and the team had built was real. Now, C++ in
my opinion, is not a beautiful programming language. And so implementing it is a very
interesting technical challenge. For me, a lot of problem-solving ends up being, how do
you factor the system the right way?</p>

<p>And so Clang has some really cool stuff that allowed it to scale and things like that, but
I was also burned out. We had just shipped it. It was amazing. I’m like, there has to be
something better. And so, Swift really came starting in 2010. It was a nights and weekends
project. It wasn’t like top-down management said, ‘Let’s go build a new programming
language.’ It was ‘Chris being burned out’—I was running a 20 to 40 person team at the
time, being an engineer during the day, and being a technical leader, but then needing an
escape hatch. And so I said, ‘Okay, well, I think we can have something better. I have a
lot of good ideas. Turns out, programming languages are a mature space. It’s not like you
need to invent pattern matching at this point. It’s embarrassing that C++ doesn’t have
good pattern matching.</p>

<h2 id="000623">00:06:23</h2>
<h2 id="ron-6">Ron</h2>
<p>We should just pause for a second, because I think this is like a small but really
essential thing. I think the single best feature coming out of language like ML in the
mid-seventies is, first of all, this notion of an algebraic data type, meaning every
programming language on earth has a way of saying this and that and the other, a record,
or a class, or a tuple.</p>

<h2 id="000638">00:06:38</h2>
<h2 id="chris-6">Chris</h2>
<p>A weird programming language, I think it was Barbara Liskov?</p>

<h2 id="000641">00:06:41</h2>
<h2 id="ron-7">Ron</h2>
<p>Yeah. And she did a lot of the early theorizing about, ‘What are abstract data types?’ But
the ability to do this or that or the other, to have data types that are a union of
different possible shapes of the data—and then having this pattern matching facility that
lets you basically in a reliable way do the case analysis so you can break down what the
possibilities are—is just incredibly useful. And very few mainstream languages have picked
it up. I mean Swift again is an example, but languages like ML, SML, and Haskell, and
OCaml—</p>

<h2 id="000709">00:07:09</h2>
<h2 id="chris-7">Chris</h2>
<p>Standard!</p>

<h2 id="000710">00:07:10</h2>
<h2 id="ron-8">Ron</h2>
<p>That’s right. SML. Standard ML. It’s been there for a long time.</p>

<h2 id="000712">00:07:12</h2>
<h2 id="chris-8">Chris</h2>
<p>I mean pattern matching, it is not an exotic feature. Here we’re talking about 2010. C#
didn’t have it. C++ didn’t have it. Obviously Java didn’t have it. I don’t think
JavaScript had it. None of these mainstream languages had it, but it’s obvious. And so
part of my opinion about that—and so by the way, I represent as engineer, I’m not actually
a mathematician, and so type theory goes way over my head. I don’t really understand
this. The thing that gets me frustrated about the academic approach to programming
languages is that people approach it by saying there’s sum types, and there’s intersection
types, and there’s these types, and they don’t start from utility forward. And so pattern
matching, when I learned OCaml, it’s so beautiful. It makes it so easy and expressive to
build very simple things. And so to me, I always identify to the utility and then yes,
there’s amazing formal type theory behind it, and that’s great and that’s why it actually
works and composes. But bringing that stuff forward and focusing on utility and the
problems it solves, and how it makes people happy, ends up being the thing that I think
moves the needle in terms of adoption, at least in mainstream.</p>

<h2 id="000809">00:08:09</h2>
<h2 id="ron-9">Ron</h2>
<p>Yeah, I mean I think that’s right. My approach also, and my interest in language is also
very much not from the mathematical perspective, although my undergraduate degree is in
math. I like math a lot, but I mostly approach these things as a practitioner. But the
thing I’ve been struck by over the years is the value of having these features have a
really strong mathematical foundation is they generalize, and as you were saying, compose
much better. If they are in the end mathematically simple, you’re way more likely to have
a feature that actually pans out as it gets used way beyond your initial view as to what
the thing was for.</p>

<h2 id="000839">00:08:39</h2>
<h2 id="chris-9">Chris</h2>
<p>That’s right. This is actually a personal defect because I don’t understand the math in
the way that maybe theoretically would be ideal. I end up having to rediscover certain
truths that are obvious. The cliche, ‘If the Russian mathematician invented it 50 years
ago…’ And so a lot of what I find is that I can find truth and beauty when things compose
and things fit together, and often I’ll find out it’s already been discovered because
everything in programming language has been done. There’s almost nothing novel, but still
that design process of saying, let’s pull things together, let’s reason about why it
doesn’t quite fit together. Let’s go figure out how to better factor this. Let’s figure
out how to make it simpler these days. That process to me, I think is kind of like people
working on physics, [from what] I hear. The simpler the outcome becomes, the more close to
truth it feels like it is. And so I share that—and maybe it’s more design gene or
engineer-design combination, but it’s probably what you mathematicians actually know
inherently, and I just haven’t figured it out yet.</p>

<h2 id="000933">00:09:33</h2>
<h2 id="ron-10">Ron</h2>
<p>Do you find yourself doing things after you come to it from an engineering perspective,
trying to figure out whether there are useful mathematical insights? Do you go back and
read the papers? Do you have other PL people who are more mathematically oriented who you
talk to? How do you extend your thinking to cover some of that other stuff?</p>

<h2 id="000947">00:09:47</h2>
<h2 id="chris-10">Chris</h2>
<p>See, the problem is math is scary to me. So I see Greek letters and I run away. I do
follow arXiv and things like this, and there’s a programming language section on that. And
so I get into some of it, but what I get attracted to in that is the examples and the
results section and the future-looking parts of it. And so it’s not necessarily the ‘how,’
it’s the ‘what it means.’ And so I think a lot of that really speaks to me. The other
thing that really speaks to me when you talk about language design and things like this is
blog posts from some obscure academic programming language that I’ve never heard of. You
just have somebody talking about algebraic effect systems for this and that and the other
thing, or something really fancy, but they figure out how to explain it in a way that’s
useful. And so when it’s not just, ‘Let me explain to you the type system,’ but it’s, ‘Let
me explain this problem this fancy feature enables,’ that’s where I get excited. That’s
where it speaks to me because, again, I’m problem-oriented, and having a beautiful way to
express and solve problems, I appreciate.</p>

<h2 id="001038">00:10:38</h2>
<h2 id="ron-11">Ron</h2>
<p>I think there’s a lot of value in the work that’s done in papers of really working out in
detail the theory and the math and how it all fits together. [And] I think the fact that
the world has been filled with a lot of interesting blog posts from the same people has
been great because I think it’s another modality where it often encourages you to pull out
the simpler and easier-to-consume versions of those ideas. And I think that is just a
different kind of insight and it’s valuable to surface that too.</p>

<h2 id="001059">00:10:59</h2>
<h2 id="chris-11">Chris</h2>
<p>And also when I look at those blog posts, sometimes they design smell. Particularly the
C++ community, there’s a lot of really good work to fix C++. They’re adding a lot of stuff
to it, and C++ will never get simpler—you can’t really remove things, right? And so a lot
of the challenge there is, it’s constrained problem-solving. And so when I look at that,
often what I’ll see when I’m reading one of those posts, and again, these are brilliant
people and they’re doing God’s work trying to solve problems with C++, best of luck with
that. But you look at that and you realize there’s a grain of sand in the system that
didn’t need to be there. And so to me, it’s like if you remove that grain of sand, then
the entire system gets relaxed and suddenly all these constraints fall away and you can
get to something much simpler. Swift, for example, it’s a wonderful language and it’s
grown really well and the community is amazing, but it has a few grains of sand in it that
cause it to be a lot more complicated. And so this is where I’m not just happy with things
that got built. LLVM is amazing, it’s very practical, but it has lots of problems. That’s
why when I get a chance to build a next generation system, I want to learn from that and
actually try to solve these problems.</p>

<h2 id="001156">00:11:56</h2>
<h2 id="ron-12">Ron</h2>
<p>So this is the great privilege of getting to work on a new language, which is a thing
you’re doing now. There’s this new language called Mojo, and it’s being done by this
company that you co-founded called Modular. Maybe just so we understand the context a
little bit, can you tell me a little bit about, what is Modular? What’s the basic
offering? What’s the business model?</p>

<h2 id="001212">00:12:12</h2>
<h2 id="chris-12">Chris</h2>
<p>Before I even get there, I’ll share more of how I got here. If you oversimplify my
background, I did this LLVM thing and its foundational compiler technology for CPUs. It
helped unite a lot of CPU-era infrastructure and it provided a platform for languages like
Swift, but also Rust, and Julia, and many different systems that all got built on top of,
and I think it really catalyzed and enabled a lot of really cool applications of
accelerated compiler technology. People use LLVM in databases and for query engine
optimization, lots of cool stuff. Maybe you use it for trading or something. I mean, there
can be tons of different applications for this kind of technology—and then [I] did
programming language stuff with Swift. But in the meantime, AI happened. And so with AI
brought this entirely new generation of compute: GPUs, tensor processing units,
large-scale AI training systems, FPGAs, and ASICs and all this complexity for compute, and
LLVM never really worked in that system.</p>

<p>And so one of the things that I built when I was at Google was a bunch of foundational
compiler technology for that category of systems. And there’s this compiler technology
called MLIR. MLIR is basically LLVM 2.0. And so take everything you learn from building
LLVM and helping solve this, but then bring it forward into this next generation of
compiler technology so that you can go hopefully unify the world’s compute for this GPU
and AI and ASIC kind of world. MLIR has been amazingly successful, and I think it’s used
in roughly every one of these AI systems and GPUs. It’s used by Nvidia, it’s used by
Google, it’s used by roughly everybody in this space. But one of the challenges is that
there hasn’t been unification. And so you have these very large-scale AI software
platforms. You have CUDA from Nvidia, you have XLA from Google, you have ROCm from AMD.</p>

<p>It’s countless. Every company has their own software stack. And one of the things that I
discovered and encountered, and I think the entire world sees, is that there’s this
incredible fragmentation driven by the fact that each of these software stacks built by a
hardware maker are just all completely different. And some of them work better than
others, but regardless, it’s a gigantic mess. And there’s these really cool high-level
technologies like PyTorch that we all love and we want to use. But if PyTorch is built on
completely different stacks and schooling together these megalithic worlds from different
vendors, it’s very difficult to get something that works.</p>

<h2 id="001417">00:14:17</h2>
<h2 id="ron-13">Ron</h2>
<p>Right. They’re both complicated trade-offs around the performance that you get out of
different tools and then also a different set of complicated trade-offs around how hard
they are to use, how complicated it is to write something in them, and then what hardware
you can target from each individual one. And each of these ecosystems is churning just
incredibly fast. There’s always new hardware coming out and new vendors in new places, and
there’s also new little languages popping up into existence, and it makes the whole thing
pretty hard to wrangle.</p>

<h2 id="001442">00:14:42</h2>
<h2 id="chris-13">Chris</h2>
<p>Exactly. And AI is moving so fast. There’s a new model every week. It’s crazy. And new
applications, new research, the amount of money being dumped into this by everybody is
just incredible. And so how does anybody keep up? It’s a structural problem in the
industry. And so the structural problem is that the people doing this kind of work, the
people doing code generation for advanced GPUs and things like this, they’re all at
hardware companies. And the hardware companies, every single one of them is building their
own stack because they have to. There is nothing to plug into. There’s nothing like ‘LLVM
but for AI,’ that doesn’t exist. And so as they go and build their own vertical software
stack, of course they’re focused on their hardware, they got advanced roadmaps, they have
a new chip coming out next year, they’re plowing their energy and time into solving for
their hardware. But we, out in the industry, we actually want something else. We want to
be able to have software that runs across multiple pieces of hardware. And so, if
everybody doing the work is at a hardware company, it’s very natural that you get this
fragmentation across vendors because nobody’s incentivized to go work together. And even
if they’re incentivized, they don’t have time to go work on somebody else’s chip. AMD is
not going to pay to work on Nvidia GPUs or something like this.</p>

<h2 id="001545">00:15:45</h2>
<h2 id="ron-14">Ron</h2>
<p>That’s true when you think about this, kind of, a split between low-level and high-level
languages. So Nvidia has CUDA and AMD has ROCm, which is mostly a clone of CUDA, and then
the XLA tools from Google work incredibly well on TPUs, and so on and so forth. Different
vendors have different things. Then there’s the high-level tools, PyTorch, and JAX, and
Triton, and various things like that. And those are typically actually not made by the
hardware vendors. Those are made by different kinds of users—I guess Google is responsible
for some of these and they’re also sometimes a hardware vendor—but a lot of the time it’s
more stepped back. Although even there, the cross-platform support is complicated and
messy and incomplete.</p>

<h2 id="001622">00:16:22</h2>
<h2 id="chris-14">Chris</h2>
<p>Because they’re built on top of fundamentally incompatible things. And so that’s the
fundamental nature. And so again, you go back to Chris’s dysfunction and my weird career
choices, I always end up back at the hardware-software boundary, and there’s a lot of
other folks that are really good at adding very high-level abstractions. If you go back a
few years ago, MLOps was the cool thing, and it was, ‘Let’s build a layer of Python on top
of TensorFlow and PyTorch and build a unified AI platform.’ But the problem with that, is
that building abstractions on top of two things that don’t work very well, can’t solve
performance, or liability, or management, or these other problems. You can only add a
layer of duct tape, but as soon as something goes wrong, you end up having to debug this
entire crazy stack of stuff that you really didn’t want to have to know about.</p>

<p>And so it’s a leaky abstraction. And so the genesis of Modular (bringing it back to this)
was realizing there are structural problems in the industry. There is nobody that’s
incentivized to go build a unifying software platform and do that work at the bottom
level. And so what we set off to do is we said, ‘Okay, let’s go build…’—and there’s
different ways of explaining this. You could say ‘a replacement for CUDA,’ that’s like a
flamboyant way to say this, but ‘let’s go build a successor to all of this technology that
is better than what the hardware makers are building, and is portable.’ And so what this
takes, is doing the work that these hardware companies are doing, and I set the goal for
the team of saying, let’s do it better than, for example, Nvidia is doing it for their own
hardware.</p>

<h2 id="001738">00:17:38</h2>
<h2 id="ron-15">Ron</h2>
<p>Which is no easy feat, right? They’ve got a lot of very strong engineers and they
understand their hardware better than anyone does. Beating them on their own hardware is
tough.</p>

<h2 id="001745">00:17:45</h2>
<h2 id="chris-15">Chris</h2>
<p>That is really hard. And they’ve got a 20-year head start, because CUDA is about 20 years
old. They’ve got all the momentum. They’re a pretty big company. As you say, lots of smart
people. And so that was a ridiculous goal. Why did I do that? Well, I mean a certain
amount of confidence in understanding how the technology worked, having a bet on what I
thought we could build and the approach, and some insight and intuition, but also
realizing that it’s actually destiny. Somebody has to do this work. If we ever want to get
to an ecosystem where one vendor doesn’t control everything, if we want to get the best
out of the hardware, if we want to get new programming language technologies, if we want
pattern matching on a GPU—I mean, come on, this isn’t rocket science—then we need at some
point to do this. And if nobody else is going to do it, I’ll step up and do that. That’s
where Modular came from—saying, ‘Let’s go crack this thing open. I don’t know how long it
will take, but sometimes it’s worthwhile doing really hard things if they’re valuable to
the world.’ And the belief was it could be profoundly impactful and hopefully get more
people into even just being able to use this new form of compute with GPUs and
accelerators and all this stuff, and just really redemocratize AI compute.</p>

<h2 id="001848">00:18:48</h2>
<h2 id="ron-16">Ron</h2>
<p>So you pointed out that there’s a real structural problem here, and I’m actually wondering
how, at a business model level, do you want to solve the structural problem? Which is, the
history of computing is these days littered with the bodies of companies that try to sell
a programming language. It’s a really hard business. How is Modular set up so that it’s
incented to build this platform in a way that can be a shared platform that isn’t subject
to just one other vendor’s lock-in?</p>

<h2 id="001911">00:19:11</h2>
<h2 id="chris-16">Chris</h2>
<p>First answer is, don’t sell a programming language. As you say, that’s very difficult. So
we’re not doing that. Go take Mojo, go use it for free. We’re not selling a programming
language. What we’re doing is we’re investing in this foundational technology to unify
hardware. Our view is, as we’ve seen in many other domains, once you fix the foundation,
now you can build high-value services for enterprises. And so our enterprise layer, often
what we talk to, you end up with these groups where you have hundreds or thousands of
GPUs. Often it’s rented from a cloud on a three-year commit. You have a platform team
that’s carrying pagers and they need to keep all this stuff running and all the production
workloads running. And then you have these product teams that are inventing new stuff all
the time, and there’s new research, there’s a new model that comes out and they want to
get it on the production infrastructure, but none of this stuff actually works.</p>

<p>And so the software ecosystem we have with all these brilliant but crazy open source tools
that are thrashing around, all these different versions of CUDA and libraries, all this
different hardware happening, is just a gigantic mess. And so, helping solve this for the
platform engineering team that actually needs to have stuff work, and want to be able to
reason about it, and want good observability and manageability and scalability and things
like this is actually, we think, very interesting. We’ve gotten a lot of good responses
from people on that. The cost of doing this is we want to actually make it work, that’s
where we do fundamental language compiler underlying systems technology and help bring
together these accelerators so that we can get, for example, the best performance on an
AMD GPU and get it so that the software comes out in the same release train as support for
an Nvidia GPU. And being able to pull that together, again, it just multiplicatively
reduces complexity, which then leads to a product that actually works, which is really
cool and very novel in AI.</p>

<h2 id="002049">00:20:49</h2>
<h2 id="ron-17">Ron</h2>
<p>So the way that Mojo plays in here, is it basically lets you provide the best possible
performance and I guess the best possible performance across multiple different hardware
platforms. Are you primarily thinking about this as an inference platform, or, how does
the training world fit in?</p>

<h2 id="002057">00:20:57</h2>
<h2 id="chris-17">Chris</h2>
<p>So let me zoom in and I’ll explain our technology components. I have a blog post series I
encourage you and any viewers or listeners to check out, called, ‘Democratizing AI
Compute.’ It goes through the history of all the systems and the problems and challenges
that they’ve run into, and it gets to, ‘What is Modular doing about it?’ So Part 11 talks
about our architecture and the inside is Mojo, which is a programming language. I’ll
explain Mojo in a second. Next level out is called MAX. And so you can think of MAX as
being a PyTorch replacement or a vLLM replacement, something that you can run on a single
node and then get high performance LLM surveying, that kind of use case. And then the next
level out is called Mammoth, and this is the cluster management Kubernetes layer. And so
if you zoom in all the way back to Mojo, you say—your experience, you know what
programming languages are, they’re incredibly difficult and expensive to build.</p>

<p>Why would you do that in the first place? And the answer is, we had to. In fact, when we
started Modular, I was like, ‘I’m not going to invent a programming language.’ I know
that’s a bad idea, it takes too long, it’s too much work. You can’t convince people to
adopt a new language. I know all the reasons why creating language is actually a really
bad idea. But it turns out, we were forced to do this because there is no good way to
solve the problem. And the problem is, how do you write code that is portable across
accelerators? So, that problem, I want portability across—for example, make it simple AMD
and Nvidia GPUs, but then you layer on the fact that you’re using a GPU because you want
performance. And so I don’t want a simplified, watered down—I want Java that runs on a
GPU.</p>

<p>I want the full power of the GPU. I want to be able to deliver performance that meets and
beats Nvidia on their own hardware. I want to have portability and unify this crazy
compute where you have these really fancy heterogeneous systems and you have tensor cores
and you have this explosion of complexity and innovation happening in this hardware
platform layer. Most programming languages don’t even know that there’s an 8-bit floating
point that exists. And so we looked around and I really did not want to have to do this,
but it turns out that there really is no good answer. And again, we decided that, hey, the
stakes are high, we want to do something impactful. We’re willing to invest. I know what
it takes to build a programming language. It’s not rocket science, it’s just a lot of
really hard work and you need to set the team up to be incentivized the right way. But we
decided that, yeah, let’s do that.</p>

<h2 id="002308">00:23:08</h2>
<h2 id="ron-18">Ron</h2>
<p>So I want to talk more about Mojo and its design, but before we do, maybe let’s talk a
little bit more about the pre-existing environment. I did actually read that blog post
series. I recommended it to everyone. I think it’s really great, and I want to talk a
little bit about what the existing ecosystem of languages looks like, but even before
then, can we talk more about the hardware? What does the space of hardware look like that
people want to run these ML models on?</p>

<h2 id="002329">00:23:29</h2>
<h2 id="chris-18">Chris</h2>
<p>Yeah, so the one that most people zero in on is the GPU. And so GPUs are, I think, getting
better understood now. And so if you go back before that though, you have CPUs. So, modern
CPUs in a data center, often you’ll have—I mean today you guys are probably riding quite
big iron, but you got 100 cores in a CPU and you got a server with two-to-four CPUs on a
motherboard, and then you go and you scale that. And so, you’ve got traditional threaded
workloads that have to run on CPUs, and we know how to scale that for internet servers and
things like this. If you get to a GPU, the architecture shifts. And so they have basically
these things called SMs. And now the programming model is that you have effectively much
more medium-sized compute that’s now put together on much higher performance memory
fabrics and the programming model shifts. And one of the things that really broke CUDA,
for example, was when GPUs got this thing called a tensor core—and the way to think about
a tensor core is it’s a dedicated piece of hardware for matrix multiplication. And so,
why’d we get that? Well, a lot of AI is matrix multiplication. And so, if you design the
hardware to be good at a specific workload, you can have dedicated silicon for that and
you can make things go really fast.</p>

<h2 id="002436">00:24:36</h2>
<h2 id="ron-19">Ron</h2>
<p>There are really these two quite different models sitting inside of the GPU space. Of
course, the name itself is weird. GPU is ‘graphics processing unit,’ which is what they
were originally for. And then this SM model is really interesting. They have this notion
of a warp. A warp is a collection of typically 32 threads that are operating together in
lockstep, always doing the same thing—a slight variation on what’s called the SIMD model,
same instruction, multiple data. It’s a little more general than that, but more or less,
you can think of it as the same thing. And you just have to run a lot of them. And then
there’s a ton of hardware inside of these systems basically to make switching between
threads incredibly cheap. So you pay a lot of silicon to add extra registers. So the
context switch is super cheap, so you can do a ton of stuff in parallel.</p>

<p>Each thing you’re doing is itself 32-wise parallel. And then because you can do all this
very fast context switching, you can hide a lot of latency. And that worked for a
while. And then we’re like, actually, we need way more of this matrix multiplication
stuff. And you can sort of do reasonably efficient matrix multiplication through this warp
model, but not really that good. And then there’s a bunch of quite idiosyncratic hardware,
which changes its performing characteristics from generation to generation, just for doing
these matrix multiplications. So that’s the Nvidia GPU story, and Volta is like V100 and
A100 and H100. They just keep on going and changing, pretty materially from generation to
generation in terms of the performance characteristics, and then also the memory model,
which keeps on changing.</p>

<h2 id="002557">00:25:57</h2>
<h2 id="chris-19">Chris</h2>
<p>You go back to intuition, CUDA was never designed for this world. CUDA was not designed
for modern GPUs. It was designed for a much simpler world. And CUDA being 20 years old, it
hasn’t really caught up. And it’s very difficult because, as you say, the hardware keeps
changing. And so CUDA was designed from a world where—almost like C is designed for a very
simple programming model that it expected to scale, but then as the hardware changed, it
couldn’t adapt. Now, if you get beyond GPUs, you get to Google TPU and many other
dedicated AI systems. They blow this way out and they say, ‘Okay, well, let’s get rid of
the threads that you have on a GPU and let’s just have matrix multiplication units and
have really big matrix multiplication units and build the entire chip around that. And you
get much more specialization, but you get a much higher throughput for those AI workloads.</p>

<p>Going back to, ‘Why Mojo?’ Well, Mojo was designed from first principles to support this
kind of system. Each of these chips, as you’re saying, even within Nvidia’s family, from
Volta, to Ampere, to Hopper, to Blackwell, these things are not compatible with each
other. Actually, Blackwell just broke compatibility with Hopper, so it can’t run Hopper
kernels always on Blackwell. Oops, well, why are they doing that? Well, AI software is
moving so fast. They decided that was the right trade-off to make. And meanwhile, we all
software people need the ability to target this. When you look at other existing systems,
with Triton for example, their goal was, ‘Let’s make it easier to program a GPU,’ which I
love, that’s awesome. But then they said, ‘We’ll just give up 20% of the performance of
the silicon to do it.’ Wait a second. I want all the performance. And so if I’m using a
GPU—GPUs are quite expensive by the way—</p>

<p>I want all the performance. And if it’s not going to be able to deliver the same quality
of results you get by writing CUDA, well then, you’re always going to run to this head
room, where you get going quickly, but then you run into a ceiling and then have to switch
to a different system to get full performance. And so this is where Mojo is really trying
to solve this problem where we can get more usability, more portability, and full
performance of the silicon because it’s designed for these wacky architectures like tensor
cores.</p>

<h2 id="002751">00:27:51</h2>
<h2 id="ron-20">Ron</h2>
<p>And if we look at the other languages that are out there, there’s languages like CUDA, and
OpenCL, which are low level, typically look like variations on C++, in that tradition are
unsafe languages, which means that there’s a lot of rules you have to follow. And if you
don’t exactly follow the rules, you’re in undefined behavior land, it’s very hard to
reason about your program.</p>

<h2 id="002810">00:28:10</h2>
<h2 id="chris-20">Chris</h2>
<p>And just let me make fun of my C++ heritage because I’ve spent so many years, like, you
just have a variable that you forget to initialize, it just shoots your foot off. [laughs]
Like, it’s just unnecessary violence to programmers.</p>

<h2 id="002821">00:28:21</h2>
<h2 id="ron-21">Ron</h2>
<p>Right. And it’s done in the interest of making performance better because the idea is C++
and its related languages don’t really give you enough information to know when you’re
making a mistake, and they want to have as much space as they can to optimize the programs
they get. So the stance is just, if you do anything that’s not allowed, we have no
obligation to maintain any kind of reasonable semantics or debug ability around that
behavior. And we’re just going to try really, really hard to optimize correct programs,
which is a super weird stance to take, because nobody’s programs are correct. There are
bugs and undefined behavior in almost any C++ program of any size. And so, you’re in a
very strange position in terms of the guarantees that you get from the compiler system
you’re using.</p>

<h2 id="002902">00:29:02</h2>
<h2 id="chris-21">Chris</h2>
<p>Well, so I mean, I can be dissatisfied. I can also be sympathetic with people that work on
C++. So again, I’ve spent decades in this language and around this ecosystem, and building
compilers for it. I know quite a lot about it. The challenge is that C++ is established,
and so there’s tons of code out there. By far, the code that’s already written is the code
that’s the most valuable. And so if you’re building a compiler, or you have a new chip, or
you have an optimizer, your goal is to get value out of the existing software. And so you
can’t invent a new programming paradigm that’s a better way of doing things and defines
away the problem. Instead, you have to work with what you’ve got. You have a SPEC
benchmark you’re trying to make go fast, and so you invent some crazy heroic hack that
makes some important benchmark work because you can’t go change the code.</p>

<p>In my experience, particularly for AI, but also I’m sure within Jane Street, if
something’s going slow, go change the code. You have control over the architecture of the
system. And so, what I think the world really benefits from, unlike benchmark hacking, is
languages that give control and power and expressivity to the programmer. And this is
something where I think that, again, you take a step back and you realize history is the
way it is for lots of structural and very valid reasons, but the reasons don’t apply to
this new age of compute. Nobody has a workload that they can pull forward to next year’s
GPU—doesn’t exist. Nobody solved this problem. I don’t know the timeframe, but once we
solve that problem, once we solve portability, you can start this new era of software that
can actually go forward. And so now, to me, the burden is—make sure it’s actually
good. And so, to your point about memory safety, don’t make it so that forgetting to
initialize a variable is just going to shoot your foot off. [Instead] produce a good
compiler error saying, ‘Hey, you forgot to initialize a variable,’ right? These basic
things are actually really profound and important, and the tooling and all this usability
and this DNA, these feelings and thoughts, are what flow into Mojo.</p>

<h2 id="003049">00:30:49</h2>
<h2 id="ron-22">Ron</h2>
<p>And GPU programming is just a very different world from traditional CPU programming just
in terms of the basic economics and how humans are involved. You end up dealing with much
smaller programs. You have these very small but very high-value programs whose performance
is super critical, and in the end, a relatively small coterie of experts who end up
programming in it. And so it pushes you ever in the direction, you’re saying, of
performance engineering, right? You want to give people the control they need to make the
thing behave as it should, and you want to do it in a way that allows people to be highly
productive. And the idea that you have an enormous amount of legacy code that you need to
bring over, it’s like, actually you kind of don’t. The entire universe of software is
actually shockingly small, and it’s really about how to write these small programs as well
as possible.</p>

<p>And also there’s another huge change. And so this is something that I don’t think that the
programming language community has recognized yet, but AI coding has massively changed the
game because now you can take a CUDA kernel and say, ‘Hey, Claude, go make that into
Mojo.’</p>

<h2 id="003145">00:31:45</h2>
<h2 id="ron-23">Ron</h2>
<p>And actually, how good have you guys found the experience of that? Of doing translation?</p>

<h2 id="003148">00:31:48</h2>
<h2 id="chris-23">Chris</h2>
<p>Well, we do hackathons and people do amazing things, having never touched Mojo, having
never done GPU programming, and within a day they can make things happen that are just
shocking. Now, AI coding tools are not magic. You cannot just vibe code DeepSeek-R1 or
something, right? But it’s amazing what that can do in terms of learning new languages,
learning new tools, and getting into and catalyzing ecosystems. And so this is one of the
things where, again, you go back five or 10 years—everybody knows nobody can learn a new
language, and nobody’s willing to adopt new things. But the entire system has changed.</p>

<h2 id="003220">00:32:20</h2>
<h2 id="ron-24">Ron</h2>
<p>So let’s talk a little bit more in detail about the architecture of Mojo. What kind of
language is Mojo, and what are the design elements that you chose in order to make it be
able to address this set of problems?</p>

<h2 id="003230">00:32:30</h2>
<h2 id="chris-24">Chris</h2>
<p>Yeah, again, just to relate how different the situation is—back when I was working on
Swift, one of the major problems to solve was, objective C was very difficult for people
to use, and you had pointers, and you had square brackets, and it was very weird. And so
the goal in the game of the day was, invent new syntax and bring together modern
programming language features to build a new language. Fast forward to today, actually,
some of that is true. AI people don’t like C++. C++ has pointers, and it’s ugly, and it’s
a 40-year-old-plus language, and has actually the same problem that Swift had to solve
back in the day. But today there’s something different, which is that AI people do
actually love a thing. It’s called Python. And so, one of the really important things
about Mojo is, it’s a member of the Python family. And so, this is polarizing to some,
because yes—I get it that some people love curly braces, but it’s hugely powerful because
so much of the AI community is Pythonic already.</p>

<p>And so we started out by saying, let’s keep the syntax like Python and only diverge from
that if there’s a really good reason. But then what are the good reasons? Well, the good
reasons are, we want—as we were talking about—performance, power, full control over the
system. And for GPUs, there’s these very important things you want to do that require
metaprogramming. And so Mojo has a very fancy metaprogramming system, kind of inspired by
this language called Zig, that brings runtime and compile time together to enable really
powerful library designs. And the way you crack open this problem with tensor cores and
things like this, is you enable really powerful libraries to be built in the language as
libraries, instead of hard coding into the compiler.</p>

<h2 id="003357">00:33:57</h2>
<h2 id="ron-25">Ron</h2>
<p>Let’s take it a little bit to the metaprogramming idea. What is metaprogramming and why
does it matter for performance in particular?</p>

<h2 id="003403">00:34:03</h2>
<h2 id="chris-25">Chris</h2>
<p>Yeah, it’s a great question, and I think you know the answer to this too, and I know you,
but—</p>

<h2 id="003408">00:34:08</h2>
<h2 id="ron-26">Ron</h2>
<p>[Laughs] We are also working on metaprogramming features in our own world.</p>

<h2 id="003411">00:34:11</h2>
<h2 id="chris-26">Chris</h2>
<p>Exactly. And so the observation here is, when you’re writing a for loop in a programming
language, for example, typically that for loop executes at runtime, so you’re writing code
that when you execute the program, it’s the instructions that the computer will follow to
execute the algorithm within your code. But when you get into designing higher level type
systems, suddenly you want to be able to run code at compile time as well. And so there’s
many languages out there. Some of them have macro systems, C++ has templates. What you end
up getting is, you end up getting, in many languages, this duality between what happens at
runtime, and then a different language almost that happens at compile time. And C++ is the
most egregious, because templates that you have a for loop in runtime, but then you have
unrolled recursive templates, or something like that at compile time.</p>

<p>Well, so the insight is, hey, these two problems are actually the same. They just run at
different times. And so what Mojo does is says, let’s allow the use of effectively any
code that you would use at runtime to also work at compile time. And so you can have a
list, or a string, or whatever you want in the algorithms—go do memory allocation,
deallocation—and you can run those at compile time, enabling you to build really powerful
high-level abstractions and put them into libraries. So why is this cool? Well, the reason
it’s cool is that on a GPU, for example, you’ll have a tensor core. Tensor cores are
weird. We probably don’t need to deep dive into all the reasons why, but the indexing and
the layout that tensor cores use is very specific and very vendor different. And so the
tensor core you have on AMD, or the tensor cores you have on different versions of Nvidia
GPUs are all very different.</p>

<p>And so what you want, is you want to build as a GP programmer a set of abstractions so you
can reason about all of these things in one common ecosystem and have the layouts much
higher level. And so what this enables, it enables very powerful libraries—and very
powerful libraries where a lot of the logic is actually done at compile time, but you can
debug it because it’s the same language that you use at runtime. And it makes the language
much more simpler, much more powerful, and just be able to scale into these complexities
in a way that’s possible with C++. But in C++, you get some crazy template stack trace
that is maddening and impossible to understand. In Mojo, you can get a very simple error
message. You can actually debug your code, and debugger things like this.</p>

<h2 id="003617">00:36:17</h2>
<h2 id="ron-27">Ron</h2>
<p>So maybe an important point here is that metaprogramming is really an old solution to this
performance problem. Maybe a good way of thinking about this is, imagine you have some
piece of data that you have that represents a little embedded domain-specific language
that you’ve written, that you want to execute via a program that you wrote. You can, in a
nice high-level way, write a little interpreter for that language that just—you know, I
have maybe a Boolean expression language or who knows what else. Maybe it’s a language for
computing on tensors in a GPU. And you could write a program that just executes that mini
domain-specific language and does the thing that you want and you can do it, but it’s
really slow. Writing an interpreter is just inherently slow because of all this
interpretation overhead where you are dynamically making decisions about what the behavior
of the program is. And sometimes what you want, is, you just want to actually emit exactly
the code that you want and boil away the control structure and just get the direct lines
of machine code that you want to do the thing that’s necessary.</p>

<p>And various forms of code generation let you get past in a simpler way, lets you get past
all of this control structure that you have to execute at runtime and instead be able to
execute it at compile time and get this minified program that just does exactly the thing
that you want. So that’s a really old idea. It goes back to all sorts of programming
languages. There’s a lot of Lisps that did a lot of this metaprogramming stuff, but then
the problem is this stuff is super hard to think about and reason about and debug. And
that’s certainly true if you think about in C, all this macro language, if you use the
various C preprocessors to do this kind of stuff in C, it’s pretty painful to reason
about. And then C++ made it richer and more expressive, but still really hard to reason
about. And you write a C++ template and you don’t really know what it’s going to do or if
it’s going to compile until you give it all the inputs and let it go and it—</p>

<h2 id="003755">00:37:55</h2>
<h2 id="chris-27">Chris</h2>
<p>Feels good in the simple case. But then when you get to more advanced cases, suddenly the
complexity compounds and it gets out of hand.</p>

<h2 id="003801">00:38:01</h2>
<h2 id="ron-28">Ron</h2>
<p>And it sounds like the thing that you’re going for in Mojo is it feels like one
language. It has one type system that covers both the stuff you’re generating statically
and the stuff that you’re doing at runtime. It sounds like debugging works in the same way
across both of these layers, but you still get the actual runtime behavior you want from a
language that you could more explicitly just be like, here’s exactly the code that I want
to generate.</p>

<h2 id="003824">00:38:24</h2>
<h2 id="chris-28">Chris</h2>
<p>[…] metaprogramming is one of the fancy features. One of the cool features is it feels
and looks like Python, but with actual types.</p>

<h2 id="003831">00:38:31</h2>
<h2 id="ron-29">Ron</h2>
<p>Right.</p>

<h2 id="003832">00:38:32</h2>
<h2 id="chris-29">Chris</h2>
<p>And let’s not forget the basics. Having something that looks and feels like Python but
it’s a thousand times faster or something is actually pretty cool. For example, if you’re
on a CPU, you have access to SIMD, the SIMD registers that allow you to do multiple
operations at a time and [to] be able to get the full power of your hardware even without
using the fancy features is also really cool. And so the challenge with any of these
systems is, how do you make something that’s powerful, but it’s also easy to use? I think
your team’s been playing with Mojo and doing some cool stuff. I mean, what have you seen
and what’s your experience been?</p>

<h2 id="003902">00:39:02</h2>
<h2 id="ron-30">Ron</h2>
<p>We’re all still pretty new to it, but I think it’s got a lot of exciting things going for
it. I mean, the first thing is, yeah, it gives you the kind of programming model you want
to get the performance that you need. And actually, in many ways the same kind of
programming model that you get out of something like CUTLASS or CuTe DSL, which are these
Nvidia-specific, some at the C++ level, some at the Python DSL level—and by the way, every
tool you can imagine nowadays is done once in C++ and once in Python. We don’t need to
implement programming languages in any other way anymore. They’re all either skins on C++
or skins on Python. But depending on which path you go down, whether you go the C++ path
or the Python path, you get all sorts of complicated trade-offs.</p>

<p>Like in the C++ path in particular, you get very painful compilation times. The thing you
said about template metaprogramming is absolutely true. The error messages are super
bad. If you look at these more Python-embedded DSLs, the compile times tend to be
better. It still can be hard to reason about though. One nice thing about Mojo is the
overall discipline seems very explicit when you want to understand: Is this a value that’s
happening at execution time at the end, or is it a value that is going to be dealt with at
compile time? It’s just very explicit in the syntax, you can look and understand. Whereas
in some of these DSLs, you have to actively go and poke the value and ask it what kind of
value it is. And I think that kind of explicitness is actually really important for
performance engineering, making it easy to understand just what precisely you’re doing.</p>

<p>You actually see this a ton, not even with these very low-level things, but if you look at
PyTorch, which is a much higher level tool, PyTorch does this thing where you get to write
a thing that looks like an ordinary Python program, but really it’s got a much trickier
execution model. Python’s an amazing and terrible ecosystem in which to do this kind of
stuff, because what guarantees do you have when you’re using Python? None. What can you
do? Anything. You have an enormous amount of freedom. The PyTorch people in particular
have leveraged this freedom in a bunch of very clever ways, where you can write a Python
program that looks like it’s doing something very simple and straightforward that would be
really slow, but no—it’s very carefully delaying and making some operations lazy so it can
overlap compute on the GPU and CPU and make stuff go really fast. And that’s really nice,
except sometimes it just doesn’t work.</p>

<h2 id="004104">00:41:04</h2>
<h2 id="chris-30">Chris</h2>
<p>This is the trap again, this is my decades of battle scars now. So as a compiler guy, I
can make fun of other compiler people. There’s this trap and it’s an attractive trap,
which is called the ‘sufficiently smart compiler.’ And so what you can do is you can take
something and you can make it look good on a demo and you can say, ‘Look! I make it super
easy and I’m going to make my compiler super smart, and it’s going to take care of all
this and make it easy through magic.’ But magic doesn’t exist. And so anytime you have one
of those ‘sufficiently smart compilers,’ if you go back in the days, it was like
auto-parallelization, just write C code is sequential logic, and then we’re going to
automatically map it into running on 100 cores on a supercomputer or something like that.</p>

<p>They often actually do work, they work in very simple cases and they work in the
demos. But the problem is that you go and you’re using them and then you change one thing
and suddenly everything breaks. Maybe the compiler crashes, it just doesn’t work. Or you
go and fix a bug and now instead of 100-times speedup, you get 100-times slowdown because
it foiled the compiler. A lot of AI tools, a lot of these systems, particularly these
DSLs, have this design point of, let me pretend like it’s easy and then I will take care
of it behind the scenes. But then when something breaks, you have to end up looking at
compiler dumps, right? And this is because magic doesn’t exist. And so this is where
predictability and control is really, I think, the name of the game, particularly if you
want to get the most out of a piece of hardware, which is how we ended up here.</p>

<h2 id="004223">00:42:23</h2>
<h2 id="ron-31">Ron</h2>
<p>It’s funny, the same issue of, “How clever is the underlying system you’re using?” comes
up when you look at the difference between CPUs and GPUs. CPUs themselves are trying to do
a weird thing where a chip is a fundamentally parallel substrate. It’s got all of these
circuits that in principle could be running in parallel and then it is yoked to running
this extremely sequential programming language, which is just trying to do one thing after
another. And then how does that actually work with any reasonable efficiency? Well,
there’s all sorts of clever dirty tricks happening under the covers where it’s trying to
predict what you’re going to do, this speculation that allows it to dispatch multiple
instructions in a row by guessing what you’re going to do in the future. There’s things
like memory prefetching where it has heuristics to estimate what memory you’re going to
ask in the future so it can dispatch multiple memory requests at the same time.</p>

<p>And then if you look at things like GPUs, and I think even more, TPUs, and then also
totally other things like FPGAs, the field-programmable gate arrays where you put
basically a circuit design on it. It’s a very different kind of software system. But all
of them are in some sense simpler and more deterministic and more explicitly
parallel. Like when you write down your program, you have to write an explicitly parallel
program—that’s actually harder to write. I don’t want to complain too much about CPUs. The
great thing about CPUs is they’re extremely flexible and incredibly easy to use and all of
that dark magic actually works a pretty large fraction of the time.</p>

<h2 id="004342">00:43:42</h2>
<h2 id="chris-31">Chris</h2>
<p>Yeah, remarkably well. But your point here, I think it’s really great, and what you’re
saying is, you’re saying CPUs are the magic box that makes sequential code go in parallel
pretty fast. And then we have new, more explicit machines, somewhat harder to program
because they’re not a magic box, but you get something from it. You get performance and
power because that magic box doesn’t come without a cost. It comes with a very significant
cost, often the amount of power that your machine dissipates. And so it’s not
efficient. And so a lot of the reasons we’re getting these new accelerators is because
people really do care about it being a hundred times faster, or using way less power, or
things like this. And I’d never thought about it, but your analogy of Triton to Mojo kind
of follows a similar pattern, right? Triton is trying to be the magic box, and it doesn’t
give you the full performance, and it burns more power, and all that kind of stuff. And so
Mojo is saying, look, let’s go back to being simple. Let’s give the programmer more
control. And that more explicit approach, I think, is a good fit for people that are
building crazy advanced hardware like you’re talking about—but also people that want to
get the best performance out of the existing hardware we have.</p>

<h2 id="004442">00:44:42</h2>
<h2 id="ron-32">Ron</h2>
<p>So we talked about how metaprogramming lets you write faster programs by boiling away this
control structure that you don’t really need. So that part’s good. How does it give you
portable performance? How does it help you on the portability front?</p>

<h2 id="004454">00:44:54</h2>
<h2 id="chris-32">Chris</h2>
<p>Yeah, so this is another great question. So in this category of ‘sufficiently smart
compilers,’ and particularly for AI compilers, there’s been years of work and MLIR has
catalyzed a lot of this work building these magic AI compilers that take TensorFlow or
even the new PyTorch stuff and trying to generate optimal code for some chip. So take some
PyTorch model and put it through a compiler, and magically get out high performance. And
so there’s tons of these things, and there’s a lot of great work done here, and a lot of
people have shown that you can take kernels and accelerate them with compilers. The
challenge with this is that people don’t ever measure—what is the full performance of the
chip? And so people always measure from a somewhat unfortunate baseline and then try to
climb higher instead of saying—what is the speed of light? And so if you measure from
speed of light, suddenly you say, okay, how do I achieve several different things?</p>

<p>Even if you zero into one piece of silicon, how do I achieve the best performance for one
use case? And then how do I make it so the software I write can generalize even within the
domain? And so for example, take a matrix multiplication, well, you want to work on maybe
float32, but then you want to generalize it to float16. Okay, well, templates and things
like this are easy ways to do this. Then programming allows you to say, okay, I will
tackle that. And then the next thing that happens is, because you went from float32 to
float16, your effective cache size has doubled, because twice as many elements fit into
cache if there’s 16 bits than if there are 32 bits. Well, if that’s the case, now suddenly
the access pattern needs to change. And so you get a whole bunch of this conditional logic
that now changes in a very parametric way as a result of one simple change that happened
with float32 to float16.</p>

<p>Now you play that forward and you say, okay, well actually matrix multiplication is a
recursive hierarchical problem. There’s specializations for tall and skinny matrices, and
a dimension is one or something. There’s all these special cases. Just one algorithm for
one chip becomes this very complicated subsystem that you end up wanting to do a lot of
transformations to so you can go specialize it for different use cases. And so Mojo with
the metaprogramming allows you to tackle that. Now you bring in other hardware, and so
think of matrix multiplication these days as being almost an operating system, and there’s
so many different subsystems, and special cases, and different D types, and crazy float4
and six and other stuff going on.</p>

<h2 id="004707">00:47:07</h2>
<h2 id="ron-33">Ron</h2>
<p>At some point they’re going to come out with a floating point number so small that it will
be a joke. But every time I think that they’re just kidding, it turns out it’s real.</p>

<h2 id="004714">00:47:14</h2>
<h2 id="chris-33">Chris</h2>
<p>Seriously, I heard somebody talking about 1.2-bit floating point, right? It’s exactly like
you’re saying, is that a joke? You can’t be serious. And so now when you bring in other
hardware, other hardware brings in more complexity because suddenly the tensor core has a
different layout in AMD than it does on Nvidia. Or maybe to your point about warps, you
have 64 threads in a warp on one and 32 threads in a warp on the other. But what you
realize is, wait a second—this really has nothing to do with hardware vendors. This is
actually true even within, for example, the Nvidia line, because across these different
data types, the tensor cores are changing. The way the tensor core works for float32 is
different from the way it works for float4 or something. And so you already—within one
vendor—have to have this very powerful metaprogramming to be able to handle the complexity
and do so in the scaffolding of a single algorithm like matrix multiplication.</p>

<p>And so now as you bring in other vendors, well it turns out hey, they all have things that
look roughly like tensor cores. And so we’re coming at this with a software engineering
perspective, and so we’re forced to build abstractions. We have this powerful
metaprogramming system so we can actually achieve this. And so even for one vendor, we get
this thing called LayoutTensor. LayoutTensor is saying, okay, well I have the ability to
reason about not just an array of numbers or a multidimensional array of numbers, but also
how it’s laid out in memory and how it gets accessed. And so now we can declaratively map
these things onto the hardware that you have and these abstractions stack. And so it’s
this really amazing triumvirate between having a type system that works well and this very
important basis. I know you’re a fan of type systems also.</p>

<p>You then bring in metaprogramming, and so you can build powerful abstractions and run a
compile time so you get no runtime overhead. And then you bring in the most important part
of this entire equation, which is programmers who understand the domain. I am not going to
write a fast matrix multiplication. I’m sorry, that’s not my experience. But there are
people in that space that are just fricking brilliant. They understand exactly how the
hardware works, they understand the use cases and the latest research and the new crazy
quantized format of the day, but they’re not compiler people. And so the magic of Mojo is
it says, ‘Hey, you have a type system, you have metaprogramming, you have effectively the
full power of a compiler that you have when you’re building libraries.’ And so now these
people that are brilliant at unlocking the power of the hardware can actually do this. And
now they can write software that scales both across the complexity of the domain but also
across hardware. And to me, that’s what I find so exciting and so powerful about
this. It’s unlocking the power of the Mojo programmer instead of trying to put it into the
compiler, which is what a lot of earlier systems have tried to do.</p>

<h2 id="004949">00:49:49</h2>
<h2 id="ron-34">Ron</h2>
<p>So maybe the key point here is that you get to build these abstractions that allow you to
represent different kinds of hardware, and then you can conditionally have your code
execute based on the kind of hardware that it’s on. It’s not like an #ifdef where you’re
picking between different hardware platforms. There are complicated data structures like
these layout values that tell you how you traverse data.</p>

<h2 id="005007">00:50:07</h2>
<h2 id="chris-34">Chris</h2>
<p>Which is kind of a tree. This isn’t just a simple int that you’re passing around. This is
like a recursive hierarchical tree that you need at compile time.</p>

<h2 id="005013">00:50:13</h2>
<h2 id="ron-35">Ron</h2>
<p>The critical thing is you get to write a thing that feels like one synthetic program with
one understandable behavior, but then parts of it are actually going to execute at compile
time, so that the thing that you generate is in fact specialized for the particular
platform that you’re going to run it on. So one concern I have over this is it sounds like
the configuration space of your programs is going to be massive, and I feel like there are
two directions where this seems potentially hard to do from an engineering
perspective. One is, can you really create abstractions that within the context of the
program hide the relevant complexity? So it’s possible for people to think in a modular
way about the program they’re building, so their brains don’t explode with the 70
different kinds of hardware that they might be running it on. And then the other question
is, how do you think about testing? Because there’s just so many configurations. How do
you know whether it’s working in all the places? Because it sounds like it has an enormous
amount of freedom to do different things, including wrong things in some cases. How do you
deal with those two problems, both controlling the complexity of the abstractions and then
having a testing story that works out?</p>

<h2 id="005111">00:51:11</h2>
<h2 id="chris-35">Chris</h2>
<p>Okay, Ron, I’m going to blow your mind. I know you’re going to be resistant to this, but
let me convince you that types are cool.</p>

<h2 id="005116">00:51:16</h2>
<h2 id="ron-36">Ron</h2>
<p>Okay!</p>

<h2 id="005118">00:51:18</h2>
<h2 id="chris-36">Chris</h2>
<p>I know you’re going to fight me on this. Well, so this is again, you go back to the
challenges and opportunities of working with either Python or C++. Python doesn’t have
types really. I mean it has some stuff, but it doesn’t really have a type system. C++ has
a type system, but it’s just incredibly painful to work with. And so what Mojo does is it
says, again, it’s not rocket science. We see it all around us. Let’s bring in
traits. Let’s bring in a reasonable way to write code so that we can build abstractions
that are domain-specific and they can be checked modularly. And so one of the big problems
with C++ is that you get error messages when you instantiate layers and layers and layers
and layers of templates. And so if you get some magic number wrong, it explodes
spectacularly in a way that you can’t reason about. And so what Mojo does, it says, cool,
let’s bring in traits that feel very much like protocols in Swift, or traits in Rust, or
type classes in Haskell. Like, this isn’t novel.</p>

<h2 id="005208">00:52:08</h2>
<h2 id="ron-37">Ron</h2>
<p>This is like a mechanism for what’s called ad hoc polymorphism, meaning I want to have
some operation or function that has some meaning, but actually it’s going to get
implemented in different ways for different types. And these are basically all mechanisms
of a way of, given the thing that you’re doing and the types involved, looking up the
right implementation that’s going to do the thing that you want.</p>

<h2 id="005225">00:52:25</h2>
<h2 id="chris-37">Chris</h2>
<p>Yeah, I mean a very simple case is an iterator. So Mojo has an iterator trait and you can
say, ‘Hey, what is an iterator over a collection?’ Well, you can either check, see if
there’s an element, or you can get the value at the current element. And then as you keep
pulling things out of an iterator, it will eventually decide to stop. And so this concept
can be applied to things like a linked list, or an array, or a dictionary, or an unbounded
sequence of packets coming off a network. And so you can write code that’s generic across
these different—call them “backends” or “models”—that implement this trait. And what the
compiler will do for you is it will check to make sure when you’re writing that generic
code, you’re not using something that won’t work. And so what that does, is it means that
you can check the generic code without having to instantiate it, which is good for compile
time. It’s good for user experience, because if you get something wrong as a programmer,
that’s important. It’s good for reasoning about the modularity of these different
subsystems, because now you have an interface that connects the two components.</p>

<h2 id="005322">00:53:22</h2>
<h2 id="ron-38">Ron</h2>
<p>I think it’s an underappreciated problem with the C++ templates approach to the world,
where C++ templates seem like a deep language feature, but really they’re just a code
generation feature.</p>

<h2 id="005332">00:53:32</h2>
<h2 id="chris-38">Chris</h2>
<p>They’re like C macros.</p>

<h2 id="005333">00:53:33</h2>
<h2 id="ron-39">Ron</h2>
<p>That’s right. It both means they’re hard to think about and reason about because it sort
of seems at first glance not to be so bad—this property that you don’t really know when
your template expands, if it’s actually going to compile. But as you start composing
things more deeply, it gets worse and worse because something somewhere is going to fail,
and it’s just going to be hard to reason about and understand. Whereas when you have
type-level notions of genericity that are guaranteed to compose correctly and won’t just
blow up, you just drive that error right down. So that’s one thing that’s nice about
getting past templates as a language feature. And then the other thing is it’s just
crushingly slow. You’re generating the code, almost exactly the same code, over and over
and over again. And so that just means you can’t save any of the compilation work. You
just have to redo the whole thing from scratch.</p>

<h2 id="005421">00:54:21</h2>
<h2 id="chris-39">Chris</h2>
<p>That’s exactly right. And so this is where again, we were talking about the sand in the
system—these little things that if you get wrong, they play forward and they cause huge
problems. The metaprogramming approach in Mojo is cool, both for usability and compile
time and correctness. Coming back to your point about portability, it’s also valuable for
portability because what it means is that the compiler parses your code, and it parses it
generically and has no idea what the target is. And so when Mojo generates the first level
of intermediate representation, the compiler representation for the code, it’s not hard
coding and the pointers are 32 bit or 64 bit, or that you’re on a x86 or whatever. And
what this means is that you can take generic code in Mojo and you can put it on a CPU and
you can put it on a GPU. Same code, same function. And again, these crazy compilery things
that Chris gets obsessed about, it means that you can slice out the chunk of code that you
want to put onto your GPU in a way that it looks like a distributed system, but it’s a
distributed system where the GPU is actually a crazy embedded device that wants this tiny
snippet of code and it wants it fully self-contained. These worlds of things that normal
programming languages haven’t even thought about.</p>

<h2 id="005529">00:55:29</h2>
<h2 id="ron-40">Ron</h2>
<p>So does that mean when I compile a Mojo program, I get a shippable executable that
contains within it another little compiler that can take the Mojo code and specialize it
to get the actual machine code for the final destination that you need? Do I bundle
together all the compilers for all the possible platforms in every Mojo executable?</p>

<h2 id="005545">00:55:45</h2>
<h2 id="chris-40">Chris</h2>
<p>The answer is no. The world’s not ready for that. And there are use cases for JIT
compilers and things like this, and that’s cool, but the default way of building, if you
just run mojo build, then it will give you just an a.out executable, a normal thing. But
if you build a Mojo package, the Mojo package retains portability. This is a big
difference. This is what Java does. If you think about Java in a completely different way
and for different reasons in a different ecosystem universe, it parses all your source
code without knowing what the target is, and it generates Java bytecode. And so it’s not
1995 anymore. The way we do this is completely different. And we’re not Java obviously,
and we have a type system that’s very different. But this concept is something that’s been
well known, and is something that at least the world of compiled languages like Swift, and
C++, and Rust have kind of forgotten.</p>

<h2 id="005628">00:56:28</h2>
<h2 id="ron-41">Ron</h2>
<p>So the Mojo package is kind of shipped with the compiler technology required to specialize
to the different domains.</p>

<h2 id="005634">00:56:34</h2>
<h2 id="chris-41">Chris</h2>
<p>Yes. And so again, by default, if you’re a user, you’re sitting on your laptop and you
say, ‘Compile a Mojo program,’ you just want an executable. But the compiler technology
has all of these powerful features and they can be used in different ways. This is similar
to LLVM, where LLVM had a just-in-time compiler, and that’s really important if you’re
Sony Pictures and you’re rendering shaders for some fancy movie, but that’s not what you’d
want to use if you’re just running a C++ code that needs to be ahead-of-time compiled.</p>

<h2 id="005657">00:56:57</h2>
<h2 id="ron-42">Ron</h2>
<p>I mean, there’s some echoes here also of the PTX story with Nvidia. Nvidia has this thing
that they sort of hide that it’s an intermediate representation, but this thing called
PTX, which is a portable bytecode essentially. And they for many years maintained
compatibility across many, many different generations of GPUs. They have a thing called
the assembler that’s part of the driver thing for loading on, and it’s really not an
assembler. It’s like a real compiler that takes the PTX and compiles it down to SASS, the
accelerator-specific machine code, which they very carefully do not fully document because
they don’t want to give away all of their secrets. And so there’s a built-in portability
story there where it’s meant to actually be portable in the future across new
generations. Although as you were pointing out before, it in fact doesn’t always
succeed. And there are now some programs that will not actually make the transition to
Blackwell.</p>

<h2 id="005742">00:57:42</h2>
<h2 id="chris-42">Chris</h2>
<p>So that’s in the category that I’d consider to be like a virtual machine, a very low-level
virtual machine by the way. And so when you’re looking at these systems, the thing I’d ask
is, what is the type system? And so if you look at PTX, because as you’re saying, you’re
totally right, it’s an abstraction between a whole bunch of source code on the top end and
then that specific SASS hardware thing on the backend, but the type system isn’t very
interesting. It’s pointers and registers and memory. And so Java, what is the type system?
Well, Java achieves portability by making the type system in its bytecode expose
objects. And so it’s a much higher level abstraction, dynamic virtual dispatch, that’s all
part of the Java ecosystem. It’s not a bytecode, but the representation that’s portable
maintains the full generic system. And so this is what makes it possible to say, ‘Okay,
well I’m going to take this code, compile it once to a package, and now go specialize and
instantiate this for a device.’ So the way that works is a little bit different, but it
enables, coming back to your original question of safety and correctness, it enables all
the checking to happen the right way.</p>

<h2 id="005840">00:58:40</h2>
<h2 id="ron-43">Ron</h2>
<p>Right, there’s also a huge shift in control. With PTX, the machine-specific details of how
it’s compiled are totally out of the programmer’s control. You can generate the best PTX
you can, and then it’s going to get compiled. How? Somehow, don’t ask too many questions,
it’s going to do what it’s going to do. Whereas here, you’re preserving in the portable
object, the programmer-driven instructions about how the specialization is going to
work. You’ve just partially executed your compilation, you’ve got partway down, and then
there’s some more that’s going to be done at the end when you pick actually where you’re
going to run it.</p>

<h2 id="005908">00:59:08</h2>
<h2 id="chris-43">Chris</h2>
<p>Exactly. And so these are all very nerdy pieces that go into the stack, but the thing that
I like is if you bubble out of that, it’s easy to use. It works. It gives good error
messages, right? I don’t understand the Greek letters, but I do understand a lot of the
engineering that goes into this. The way this technology stack builds up, the whole
purpose is to unlock compute, and we want new programmers to be able to get into the
system. And if they know Python, if they understand some of the basics of the hardware,
they can be effective and then they don’t get limited to 80% of the performance. They can
keep driving and keep growing in sophistication, and maybe not everybody wants to do
that. They can stop at 80%, but if you do want to go all the way, then you can get there.</p>

<h2 id="005944">00:59:44</h2>
<h2 id="ron-44">Ron</h2>
<p>One thing I’m curious about is, how do you actually manage to keep it simple? You said
that Mojo is meant to be Pythonic and you talked a bunch about the syntax, but actually
one of the nice things about Python is it’s simple in some ways in a deeper sense. The
fact that there isn’t by default a complicated type system with complicated type errors to
think about—there’s a lot of problems with that, but it’s also a real source of simplicity
for users who are trying to learn the system. Dynamic errors at runtime are in some ways
easier to understand. ‘I wrote a program and it tried to do a thing and it tripped over
this particular thing and you can see it tripping over,’ and in some ways that’s easier to
understand when you’re going to a language which, for both safety and performance reasons,
needs much more precise type level control. How do you do that in a way that still feels
Pythonic in terms of the base simplicity that you’re exposing to users?</p>

<h2 id="010028">01:00:28</h2>
<h2 id="chris-44">Chris</h2>
<p>I can’t give you the perfect answer, but I can tell you my current thoughts. So again,
learn from history. Swift had a lot of really cool features, but it spiraled and got a lot
of complexity that got layered in over time. And also one of the challenges with Swift is
it had a team that was paid to add features to swift.</p>

<h2 id="010046">01:00:46</h2>
<h2 id="ron-45">Ron</h2>
<p>It’s never a good thing.</p>

<h2 id="010047">01:00:47</h2>
<h2 id="chris-45">Chris</h2>
<p>Well, you have a C++ committee, what is the C++ committee going to do? They’re going to
keep adding features to C++. Don’t expect C++ to get smaller. It’s common sense. And so
with Mojo, there’s a couple of different things. So one of which is, start from Python. So
Python being the surface-level syntax enables me as management to be able to push back and
say, ‘Look, let’s make sure we’re implementing the full power of the Python
ecosystem. Let’s have lists, and for-comprehensions, and all this stuff before just
inventing random stuff because it might be useful.’ But there’s also, for me personally, a
significant back pressure on complexity. How can we factor these things? How can we get,
for example, the metaprogramming system to subsume a lot of complexity that would
otherwise exist? And there are fundamental things that I want us to add.</p>

<p>For example, checked generics, things like this because they have a better UX, they’re
part of the metaprogramming system, they’re part of the core addition that we’re adding,
but I don’t want Mojo to turn into a ‘add every language feature’ that every other
language has just because it’s useful to somebody. I was actually inspired by and learned
a lot from Go, and it’s a language that people are probably surprised to hear me talk
about. Go, I think, did a really good job of intentionally constraining the language with
Go 1. And they took a lot of heat for that. They didn’t add a generic system, and
everybody, myself included, were like, ‘Ha ha ha, why doesn’t this language even have a
generic system? You’re not even a modern language.’ But they held the line, they
understood how far people could get, and then they did a really good job of adding
generics to Go 2, and I thought they did a great job.</p>

<p>There was a recent blog post I was reading, talking about Go, and apparently they have an
80-20 rule, and they say they want to have 80% of the features with 20% of the complexity,
something like that. And the observation is that that’s a point in the space that annoys
everybody, because everybody wants 81% of the features, but 81% of the features maybe
gives you 35% of the complexity. And so, figuring out where to draw that line and figuring
out where to say no—for example, we have people in the community that are asking for very
reasonable things that exist in Rust. And Rust is a wonderful language. I love it. There’s
a lot of great ideas and we shamelessly pull good ideas from everywhere. But I don’t want
the complexity.</p>

<h2 id="010302">01:03:02</h2>
<h2 id="ron-46">Ron</h2>
<p>I often like to say that one of the most critical things about a language design is
maintaining the power-to-weight ratio.</p>

<p>You want to get an enormous amount of good functionality, and power, and good user
experience while minimizing that complexity. I think it is a very challenging thing to
manage, and it’s actually a thing that we are seeing a lot as well. We are also doing a
lot to extend OCaml in all sorts of ways, pulling from all sorts of languages, including
Rust, and again, doing it in a way where the language maintains its basic character and
maintains its simplicity is a real challenge. And it’s kind of hard to know if you’re
hitting the actual right point on that. And it’s easier to do in a world where you can
take things back, try things out and decide that maybe they don’t work, and then adjust
your behavior. And we’re trying to iterate a lot in that mode, which is a thing you can do
under certain circumstances. It gets harder as you have a big open-source language that
lots of people are using.</p>

<h2 id="010347">01:03:47</h2>
<h2 id="chris-46">Chris</h2>
<p>That’s a really great point. And so one of the other lessons I’ve learned with Swift, is
that with Swift, I pushed very early to have an open design process where anybody could
come in, write a proposal, and then it would be evaluated by the language committee, and
then if it was good, it would be implemented and put into Swift. Again, be careful what
you wish for. That enabled a lot of people with really good ideas to add a bunch of
features to Swift. And so with Mojo as a counterbalance, I really want the core team to be
small. I want the core team not just to be able to add a whole bunch of stuff because it
might be useful someday, but to be really deliberate about how we add things, how we
evolve things.</p>

<h2 id="010420">01:04:20</h2>
<h2 id="ron-47">Ron</h2>
<p>How are you thinking about maintaining backwards compatibility guarantees as you evolve it
forward?</p>

<h2 id="010425">01:04:25</h2>
<h2 id="chris-47">Chris</h2>
<p>We’re actively debating and discussing what Mojo 1.0 looks like. And so I’m not going to
give you a timeframe, but it will hopefully not be very far away. And what I am fond of is
this notion of semantic versioning, and saying we’re going to have a 1.0, and then we’re
going to have a 2.0, and we’re going to have a 3.0, and we’re going to have a 4.0, et
cetera. And each of these will be able to be incompatible, but they can link together. And
so one of the big challenges and a lot of the damage in the Python ecosystem was from the
Python two-to-three conversion. It took 15 years and it was a heroic mess for many
different reasons. The reason it took so long is because you have to convert the entire
package ecosystem before you can be 3.0. And so if you contrast that to something like
C++, let me say good things about C++, they got the ABI right.</p>

<p>And so once the ABI was set, then you could have one package built in C++ 98, and one
package built in C++ 23, and these things would interoperate and be compatible even if you
took new keywords or other things in the future language version. And so what I see for
Mojo is much more similar to the—maybe the C++ ecosystem or something like this, but that
allows us to be a little bit more aggressive in terms of migrating code, in terms of
fixing bugs, and in moving language forward. But I want to make sure that Mojo 2.0 and
Mojo 1.0 packages work together and that there’s good tooling, probably AI-driven, but
good tooling to move from 1.0 to 2.0 and be able to manage the ecosystem that way.</p>

<h2 id="010549">01:05:49</h2>
<h2 id="ron-48">Ron</h2>
<p>I think the type system also helps an enormous amount. I think one of the reasons the
Python migration was so hard is that you couldn’t be like, ‘And then let me try and build
this with Python 3 and see what’s broken.’ You could only see what’s broken by actually
walking all of the execution paths of your program. And if you didn’t have enough testing,
that would be very hard. And even if you did, it wasn’t that easy. Whereas with a strong
type system, you can get an enormous amount of very precise guidance. And actually the
combination of a strong type system and an agentic coding system is awesome. We actually
have a bunch of experience of just trying these things out now, where you make some small
change to the type of something and then you’re like, ‘Hey, AI system, please run down all
the type errors, fix them all.’ And it does surprisingly well.</p>

<h2 id="010626">01:06:26</h2>
<h2 id="chris-48">Chris</h2>
<p>I absolutely agree. There’s other components to it. So Rust has done a very good job with
the stabilization approach with crates and APIs. And I think that’s a really good
thing. And so I think we’ll take good ideas from many of these different ecosystems and
hopefully do something that works well, and works well for the ecosystem, and allows us to
scale without being completely constrained by never being able to fix something once you
ship a 1.0.</p>

<h2 id="010645">01:06:45</h2>
<h2 id="ron-49">Ron</h2>
<p>I’m actually curious, just to go to the agentic programming thing for a second, which is
having AI agents that write good kernels is actually pretty hard. And I’m curious what
your experience is of how things work with Mojo. Mojo is obviously not a language deeply
embedded in the training set that these models were built on, but on the other hand, you
have this very strong type structure that can guide the process of the AI agent trying to
write and modify code. I’m curious how that pans out in practice as you try and use these
tools.</p>

<h2 id="010712">01:07:12</h2>
<h2 id="chris-49">Chris</h2>
<p>So this is why Mojo being open source, and—so we have hundreds of thousands of lines of
Mojo code that are public with all these GPU kernels, and like, all this other cool
stuff. And we have a community of people writing more code. Having hundreds of thousand
lines of Mojo code is fantastic. You can point your coding tool cursor, or whatever it is,
at that repo and say, ‘Go learn about this repo and index it.’ So it’s not that you have
to train the model to know the language, just having access to it—that enables it to do
good work. And these tools are phenomenal. And so that’s been very, very, very
important. And so we have instructions on our webpage for how to set up these tools, and
there’s a huge difference if you set it up right, so that it can index that, or if you
don’t, and make sure to follow that markdown file that explains how to set up the tool.</p>

<h2 id="010754">01:07:54</h2>
<h2 id="ron-50">Ron</h2>
<p>So, I want to talk a little bit about the future of Mojo. I think that the current way
that Modular and you have been talking about Mojo, these days at least—it’s a replacement
for CUDA, an alternate full top-to-bottom stack for building GPU kernels, for writing
programs that execute on GPUs. But that’s not the only way you’ve ever talked about
Mojo. You’ve also, especially earlier on I think, there was more discussion of Mojo as an
extension, and maybe evolution of, and maybe eventually replacement of Python. And I’m
curious, how do you think about that now? To what degree do you think of Mojo as its own
new language that takes inspiration and syntax from Python, and to what degree do you want
something that’s more deeply integrated over time?</p>

<h2 id="010832">01:08:32</h2>
<h2 id="chris-50">Chris</h2>
<p>So today, to pull it back to, ‘What is Mojo useful for today, and how do we explain it?’
Mojo is useful if you want code to go fast. If you have code on a CPU or a GPU and you
want it to go fast, Mojo is a great thing. One of the really cool things that is available
now—but it’s in preview and it’ll solidify in the next month or something—is it’s also the
best way to extend Python. And so if you have a large-scale Python code base, again, tell
me if this sounds familiar, you are coding away and you’re doing cool stuff in Python and
then it starts to get slow. Typically what people do is, they have to either go rewrite
the whole thing in Rust or C++, or they carve out some chunk of it and move some chunk of
that package to C++ or Rust. This is what NumPy, or PyTorch, or all modern large-scale
Python code bases end up doing.</p>

<h2 id="010913">01:09:13</h2>
<h2 id="ron-51">Ron</h2>
<p>If you look up on the mirrors and look at the percentage of programs that have C
extensions in them, it’s shockingly high. A really large fraction of Python stuff is
actually part Python and part some other language, almost always C and C++, a little bit
of Rust.</p>

<h2 id="010927">01:09:27</h2>
<h2 id="chris-51">Chris</h2>
<p>That’s right. And so today—this isn’t distant future—today, you can take your Python
package and you can create a Mojo file and you can say, ‘Okay, well these for loops are
slow, move it over to Mojo.’ And we have people, for example, doing bioinformatics and
other crazy stuff I know nothing about, saying, ‘Okay, well I’m just taking my Python
code, I move it over to Mojo. Wow, now I get types, I get these benefits, but there’s no
bindings. The pip experience is beautiful. It’s super simple.’ You don’t have to have
FFI’s and nanobind and all this complexity to be able to do this. You also are not moving
from Python with its syntax to curly braces and borrow checkers and other craziness. You
now get a very simple and seamless way to extend your Python package. And we have people
that say, okay, well I did that and I got it first 10x, and 100x, and 1000x faster on CPU.</p>

<p>But then because it was easy, I just put it on a GPU. And so to me, this is amazing
because these are people that didn’t even think and would never have gotten it on a GPU if
they switched to Rust or something like that. Again, the way I explain it is, Mojo is good
for performance. It’s good if you want to go fast on a GPU, on a CPU, if you want to make
Python go fast, or if you want to—I mean, some people are crazy enough to go whole hog and
just write entirely from scratch Mojo programs, and that’s super cool. If you fast forward
six, nine months, something, I think that Mojo will be a very credible top-to-bottom
replacement for Rust.</p>

<p>And so we need a few more extensions to the generic system. And there’s a few things I
want to bake out a little bit. Some of the dynamic features that Rust has for the
existentials, the ability to make a runtime trait is missing in Mojo. And so we’ll add a
few of those kinds of features. And as we do that, I think that’ll be really interesting
as an applications-level programming language for people who care about this kind of
stuff. You fast forward, I might even project a timeframe, maybe a year, 18 months from
now, it depends on how we prioritize things, and we’ll add classes. And so as we add
classes, suddenly it will look and feel to a Python programmer much more familiar. The
classes in Mojo will be intentionally designed to be very similar to Python, and at that
point we’ll have something that looks and feels kind of like a Python 4.</p>

<p>It’s very much cut from the same mold as Python. It integrates really well from
Python. It’s really easy to extend Python, and so it’s very much a member of the Python
family, but it’s not compatible with Python. And so what we’ll do over the course of N
years, and I can’t predict exactly how long that is, is continue to run down the line of,
okay, well how much compatibility do we want to add to this thing? And then I think that
at some point people will consider it to be a Python superset, and effectively it will
feel just like the best way to do Python in general. And I think that that will come in
time. But to bring it all the way back, I want us to be very focused on, ‘What is Mojo
useful for today?’ Great claims require great proof.</p>

<p>We have no proof that we can do this. I have a vision and a future in my brain, and I’ve
built a few languages and some scale things before, and so I have quite high confidence
that we can do this. But I want people to zero back into, okay, if you’re writing
performance code, if you’re writing GPU kernels or AI, if you have Python code, you don’t
want it to go slow, a few of us have that problem, then Mojo can be very useful. And
hopefully it’ll be even more useful to more people in the future.</p>

<h2 id="011226">01:12:26</h2>
<h2 id="ron-52">Ron</h2>
<p>And I think that already, the practical short-term thing is already plenty ambitious and
exciting on its own. Seems like a great thing to focus on.</p>

<h2 id="011232">01:12:32</h2>
<h2 id="chris-52">Chris</h2>
<p>Yeah, let’s solve heterogeneous compute and AI. That’s actually a pretty useful thing,
right?</p>

<h2 id="011237">01:12:37</h2>
<h2 id="ron-53">Ron</h2>
<p>Alright, that seems like a great place to stop. Thank you so much for joining me.</p>

<h2 id="011241">01:12:41</h2>
<h2 id="chris-53">Chris</h2>
<p>Yeah, well thank you for having me. I love nerding out with you and I hope it’s useful and
interesting to other people too. But even if not, I had a lot of fun with you.</p>

I was curious about this. It says “Live Set,” but was released in the 64K category. What is this exactly? Is this live coding?</strong></p><p>0b5vr GLSL Techno Live Set (“0mix”) is indeed a 64K intro demo. Just like any other 64K intro, this audiovisual piece is generated from a 64KB file―an HTML file, in this case.</p><p>That said, as described in the title, its format is “Live Set.” It can be somewhat tricky, because it looks like a recorded video of a live performance at an event, but it’s actually a 64K intro.</p><div><p><iframe title="0b5vr GLSL Techno Live Set - &quot;0mix&quot; (WebGL 64KB Intro)" width="1068" height="601" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3lOptjAeA2w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div><p><strong>Hmm… I’m still not sure if I understood correctly. Could you elaborate a bit more?</strong></p><p>0mix was inspired by three different scenes: techno demos, live coding, and 64K intros.</p><p>Let me start with techno demos. There are many techno-themed demos in the history of the demoscene. If you look at the demos such as “<a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYvn653Fefw" target="_blank">Medium</a>” by Einklang.net, “<a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5HPZr7gBbY" target="_blank">X-MIX 2004: Ion Traxx</a>” by Kewlers &amp; mfx, and “<a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5PqEePIghE" target="_blank">Emix</a>” by Epoch, they use multiple tracks mixed together like a DJ set, rather than a single techno soundtrack. They also use VJ-style visuals to create an atmosphere similar to a club event. Emix has black-and-white visuals with unique textures that fit perfectly with cold, mechanical techno, and it’s one of my favorites.</p><p>Next is live coding. Live coding is a live performance where visuals and music are generated with programming in real time. On the screen, you’ll see the visuals and sound waveforms being generated alongside the code you’re writing. This highlights that the artwork is generated by code. In the demoscene, live coding sessions focus mostly on visuals in GLSL (eg, <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk9f4GUuXGk" target="_blank">Shader Showdown</a>, <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_u8DkST08k" target="_blank">Shader Jam</a>). But in live coding events like Algorave and Eulerroom, music live coding is as popular as, or even more popular than, visual coding. From what I see, Tidal Cycles and Sonic Pi are the most commonly used tools in those environments. (<a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgPf24_OQZY" target="_blank">Reference video</a>)</p><p>Finally, there’s the 64K intro. It’s a category where you create visuals and audio with an executable file of just 64KB. This is the most challenging category since every element has to be procedurally generated within the intro. Most 64K creators build their own engines and tools from scratch. This category requires a broad range of knowledge and skills including modeling, animation, rendering, post-processing, music, and compression.</p><p>If I managed to merge all three inspirations and create a 64K techno demo with music generated by live coding, I knew I could present it to demosceners and other creators around the scene with confidence. I came up with the idea about a year before Revision 2023. Over the course of that year, I refined a demo engine, built a live coding environment, composed music, and created visual assets almost entirely on my own.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://6octaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ob5_ref1-432x432.webp" alt="0mix reference screen" width="432" height="432" srcset="https://6octaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ob5_ref1-432x432.webp 432w, https://6octaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ob5_ref1-800x800.webp 800w, https://6octaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ob5_ref1-324x324.webp 324w, https://6octaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ob5_ref1-768x768.webp 768w, https://6octaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ob5_ref1-150x150.webp 150w, https://6octaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ob5_ref1.webp 839w" sizes="(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px"><br> <span>Here’s the working environment for 0mix. The top screen shows the preview, timeline, etc., while the bottom screen is the code editor. Basically, I spend most of the time in the code editor.</span></p><p> <strong>So, you climbed the highest mountain by yourself. What was the process like?</strong></p><p>It was extremely tough and painful to spend a year working on a challenging 64K project by myself. My advice is to collaborate with others. At the very least, you should find someone you can discuss the progress with. It was indeed fun to surprise many friends at demoparties, but at the end of the day, completing the project is more important.</p><p><strong>You entered 64K compo, but it ended up being released in the PC Demo compo. Did that bother you?</strong></p><p>It’s true that 0mix was released in the PC Demo Compo at Revision 2023. That was because it was the only entry in the PC 64K intro, which wasn’t enough to hold a separate compo. So the two compos were merged. The same thing happened at Revision 2022. <a rel="noopener" href="https://demozoo.org/parties/4424/#competition_17032" target="_blank">PC 64K intro compo was incorporated into the 8K</a> intro compo because there were only two entries. Nevertheless, I’ve always pursued uncompromising quality, so I was down with it. Along with the works of other demo groups (such as Fairlight, mfx, and Still), I think I could contribute to making that compo interesting.</p><p><strong>Ah, you’re right. That felt like a never-ending compo!</strong></p><p>There were so many entries for Revision 2023, and from the chat I got the impression that many participants and viewers were exhausted after the compo. Still, it was a great compo. All of the top works featured demoscene-style visuals built with their own engines, and their narratives were also impressive. So I’m happy with my result. When there’s a big entry in the compo I’m in, I feel more accomplished because it means I helped make that compo exciting together with those great pieces.</p><p><strong>That’s right, I remember some big names rushing in at the end. Nevertheless, this demo stood out for its originality.</strong></p><p>Thank you. Revision has an award called “Crowd Favorite” where viewers can vote for their favorite demo in any category, and 0mix received first prize. 0mix is a piece that reflects what I love, so I felt happy that everyone else enjoyed it, too.</p><div id="attachment_2198"><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2198" src="https://6octaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ob5_ref3-324x430.webp" alt="0mix crowd favorite" width="324" height="430" srcset="https://6octaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ob5_ref3-324x430.webp 324w, https://6octaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ob5_ref3-432x573.webp 432w, https://6octaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ob5_ref3.webp 632w" sizes="(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-2198">photo provided by 0b5vr</p></div><p><strong>Congratulations! It was indeed a cool demo.</strong></p><p>Oh, I have a question for you. How do you feel about the code constantly shown in 0mix? What kind of impression does it give you? <br> <span>(Interviewer’s note: I’m not from the programming field. I’m the type of person who chooses a laptop by its color.)</span></p><p><strong>Maybe it’s more like a design or typography? It says “live coding,” so I figured this code is for its visuals, but I have absolutely no idea if the code itself is cool or not. If I didn’t know what live coding is, I’d probably just look at it as part of the design, just like seeing the typography in a language I don’t understand.</strong></p><p>Ah, that’s interesting! Actually, the code displayed on the screen is not for visuals but for music. I use a programming language called GLSL, which is normally used to generate visuals. But 0mix is a live performance-themed demo where I use GLSL for music, and that’s why it’s called “GLSL Techno Live.” If you look at the code closely, you’ll see the parts for instruments, like “KICK,” “HIHAT,” and “BASS.” And by adding and subtracting these elements, I shaped the flow of music.</p><p><strong>Ohh, so that was code for music! But even after knowing this fact, my impression of this piece hasn’t really changed. I guess that shows I interpreted the code as part of the design. Is it okay if a viewer like me sees it that way? (laughs)</strong></p><p><a rel="noopener" href="https://scrapbox.io/0b5vr/Reflection_of_0mix" target="_blank">In my post about this production on Scrapbox</a>, I wrote, <em>“for viewers without coding knowledge, it feels like music-making magic. And for viewers who know programming languages and environments, it’s a hint to guess the next move.”</em> So I expected that some people would see it as part of the design.</p><p><strong>To reveal a bit more about my understanding, now I do understand that “demo is generated from an executable file” and that “a 64K piece has a 64KB file.” But I still don’t see things like “this is real-time rendering, so it’s more impressive than live-action” or “it’s great quality considering this is 64KB.” Basically, I watch demos like I watch music videos, and the only thing that matters to me is whether I find it cool or not.</strong></p><p>Ryoji Ikeda has a work that presents data including planets and genes using 5×5 pixel fonts. Of course, only experts can truly understand such data, so most of us simply enjoy the visual design that comes out of it. Even if we try to find deeper meaning in it, we probably just end up saying something like, “Wow, the world is huge.” I’ve read that Ikeda actually intended for viewers to see it that way.</p><p><strong>Oh, then I’m actually one of his intended viewers. When I first saw his installation video, I knew him as a musician, so I thought, “Wow, that’s his MV? Cool! Very futuristic!” I later realized that it wasn’t just design. It’s nice to know that creators and demosceners expected viewers like me, and personally, I feel relieved. I’d always thought they might be annoyed to hear a clueless person like me commenting on their piece. (laughs)</strong></p><p>To me, how others first got interested in a piece or in the culture is as fascinating as the motives behind its creation. So I do appreciate sceners who are not from the tech side!</p><p><strong>Thank you! That’s really nice and reassuring to hear!<br> OK, let’s go back to that music code. You wrote in your post on Scrapbox that you put a lot of time and effort into the music.</strong></p><p>Actually, I had never really made this type of techno music before, so I watched a lot of live performances of this style and tutorials on YouTube. I also bought and tried hardware for “machine live” performances, like the Elektron Syntakt and Dirtywave M8, for research.</p><p><strong>What is “machine live”?</strong></p><p>“Machine live” is a type of music performance similar to live coding. Performers use music equipment like grooveboxes and modular synths in real-time to control the sound during the performance. What you can do depends on the features of the equipment, so performers always have to be aware of limitations—something somewhat similar to the demoscene. It’s a fascinating culture. There’s even a “DAWless Live” category where you perform without using a DAW, the standard PC-based music production system. For 0mix, I drew a lot of inspiration from the philosophy and methods of machine live and applied them to GLSL live coding. (<a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hs29fAKYJE" target="_blank">Reference video</a>)</p><p><strong>I just watched the reference video you sent me. Does everyone in this scene really use that much gear?</strong></p><p>Of course not. Not everyone uses this much equipment, or equipment of this size, for live performance. Lately, it seems like the palm-sized Dirtywave M8 is trending for live sets. The Dirtywave M8 uses a tracker-style UI, and it’s fun to compose with. Plus, it fits well with the demoscene aesthetic.</p><p>I did a lot of research on machine live and live coding performances, and this gave me ideas about how to create sound and how to evolve live performance. But that only covered the technical side. When it comes to making techno, especially abstract sounds, I had to learn through trial and error and trust my feelings. Even after I learned how to make sounds on standard hardware or software, GLSL follows a completely different set of rules, and I had to be really fired up to tackle it.</p><p><strong>I heard that you did a live performance recently. What kind of event was it?</strong></p><p>I performed a live coding set at “<a rel="noopener" href="https://function-draw.com/tokyo2" target="_blank">draw(tokyo); #2</a>” in March 2025. “draw(); ” is a club event focused on audiovisuals, especially live coding and generative VJ (the so-called “<em>gene-kei</em>” performances). It takes place from time to time in VRChat and at physical venues.</p><p>At draw(tokyo); #2, I performed using Wavenerd, my custom GLSL live coding environment. For my 40-minute live set, I mainly used techno patterns created for 0mix. It was a really memorable experience, since it was my first time doing a live music performance with Wavenerd. I’d love to do more live performances in the future.</p><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://6octaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ob5_ref2-432x165.webp" alt="reference screen" width="432" height="165" srcset="https://6octaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ob5_ref2-432x165.webp 432w, https://6octaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ob5_ref2-800x305.webp 800w, https://6octaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ob5_ref2-324x123.webp 324w, https://6octaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ob5_ref2-768x293.webp 768w, https://6octaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ob5_ref2-1536x585.webp 1536w, https://6octaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ob5_ref2.webp 1872w" sizes="(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px"></p><p><span>The “Wavenerd” system I used for my live coding performance at draw(tokyo); #2. Since we were chroma keying with VJ visuals, the background is blue. The performers are always lit up in blue.</span></p><p><strong>When a coder does a live music performance, aren’t you too busy typing code in front of the PC to even look at the audience’s reaction?</strong></p><p>During the performances, I rewrite parts of prewritten code, so I don’t need to constantly keep typing. But I’m busy adding and removing parts, changing parameters, and doing some DJ-style mixing, so basically I completely zone in on the screen. That said, I can still see the audience’s reactions to some extent, and I felt really happy when they reacted at the moments I expected.</p><p><strong>Do you know who the primary audience is? I guess this kind of live performance requires some knowledge to really enjoy it.</strong></p><p>I still don’t know what kind of audience it attracts. From what I saw, I got the impression that many of them are interested in musical experiences and visual production at least. But I’m not sure how many are interested in coding, or actually create things with code. How technical it should get, how strictly you stick to the technical restrictions, and how much you make the audience dance—I think performers are expected to balance these elements well. Probably, this is something <em>gene-kei</em> performers constantly have to tackle. In fact, quite a few performers change their set depending on the tone of the event.</p><p><strong>Did you have VJs for your live performance?</strong></p><p>Yes, I asked fellow demosceners, <a rel="noopener" href="https://ukonpower.dev/" target="_blank">ukonpower</a> and <a rel="noopener" href="https://x.com/Renard_VRC" target="_blank">Renard</a>, and they generated visuals that matched the techno. I just told them, “I’m going to do 0mix,” and they both knew what it meant, so everything went very smoothly. (laughs) They created visuals in my style, but their own personalities also shone through. It was really cool.</p><div><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="0b5vr x ukonpower x Renard @ draw(tokyo); #2 | GLSL Techno Live Set" width="1068" height="601" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mmrl-nI8AEo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div><p><strong>Oh, that’s really cool! <br> <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.pouet.net/groups.php?which=15409" target="_blank">According to your discography</a>, you also have 4K as well as 64K works. Is there a reason for that?<br> </strong></p><p>For the 4K intros I’ve released lately, I can usually create them in one or two weeks. But 64K is my soul, so I want to keep making 64K intros. The thing is, 64K requires hundreds of times more work than 4K. So, when I don’t have the time or motivation but still want to contribute to a demoparty, I just make a 4K intro.</p><p>I must say that the production environment for 4K intros is well-supported in the current demoscene. Recently I’ve been using 0x4015’s <a rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/yosshin4004/minimal_gl" target="_blank">minimalGL</a>. With this demotool, I can easily create 4K intros just by writing GLSL. That being said, I wouldn’t recommend it to everyone, because you also have to write the music in GLSL.</p><p>In 2023, I released a 4K intro called “<a rel="noopener" href="https://demozoo.org/productions/331908/" target="_blank">Architectural Shapeshifte</a>r” with Renard. For this piece, Renard was in charge of the concept and visuals, while I was in charge of the music and direction. We used minimalGL for this piece as well. It was the first time for Renard to create a 4K intro, but he was able to create it easily. We collaborated by tweaking the source code on GitHub and communicating via Discord. We exchanged ideas and suggestions on each other’s code, and it turned out to be a very efficient workflow.</p><div><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="&quot;Architectural Shapeshifter&quot; by Renard &amp; 0b5vr (Windows 4KB Intro)" width="1068" height="601" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j_6X7Ns0p9Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div><p>There are many coders who can write GLSL in Japan, but not many of them take on 4K. So I’d love to collaborate more using minimalGL.</p><p><strong>What’s hot in the Japanese demoscene these days? What category is popular? I noticed there was a demoparty called SESSIONS in Japan last year.</strong></p><p>It seems like a lot of people are coming into the demoscene from shader culture centered around VRChat. The people I got to know at demoparties like <a rel="noopener" href="https://sessions-party.com/" target="_blank">SESSIONS</a> were mostly active in VRChat. In particular, the event draw(); seems to have a strong influence, and many of the people who got interested in live coding or generative VJ through draw();’s audiovisual experience also developed an interest in the demoscene.</p><p><strong>Live coding and generative VJ becoming a gateway into the demoscene sounds like a new path to me.</strong></p><p>Yes, indeed. draw();’s main crew, Saina-san, purposefully aims for a crossover with demoscene culture, like SESSIONS, and this accelerates the influx. We’re really grateful for that.</p><p><strong>I’m sure a person like that is supporting the demoscene in Japan and around the world. <br> OK, let’s go back to the production. Is there anything you do in everyday life to get inspired for your creations?</strong></p><p>I check Pouet and Demozoo as much as possible to stay in the know about recent demoscene productions. If I ever stopped checking Pouet and Demozoo, I think that would be the end of me as a demoscener.</p><p>I also try to take in other cultures as well. Recently, I’ve been fascinated by the flashy audiovisual productions in pachinko and pachislot machines. They use dazzling visuals and music to stir up the spirit of gambling. These productions thoroughly pursue how to exploit the human reward system, all within machines that operate under very strict legal restrictions. In a way, I think this represents the highest peak of visual entertainment.</p><p>I also go for walks frequently. Especially walking around Tokyo late at night gives me a strong sense of urban life and social activity, and it inspires me a lot. “<a rel="noopener" href="https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=90435" target="_blank">Domain</a>“, a 64K intro I released at Tokyo Demo Fest 2021, was heavily inspired by night Tokyo. I find the concept of the night city very interesting, and I’d like to explore it further.</p><div><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="&quot;Domain&quot; by 0b5vr, WebGL 64KB Intro (Final)" width="1068" height="601" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D2COWeeEqTs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div><p><strong>Which areas do you usually walk around?</strong></p><p>I mainly walk around downtown. I can feel the rhythm of social activity through people’s movements, clothing, and buildings. It’s also very fun to walk around residential areas. When I imagine that this is someone’s everyday life, I can sense their presence through the scenery.</p><p><strong>Do you have anything you always keep in mind when you create, like a routine or your own personal rule?</strong></p><p>For my demo source code, I use Git for version control and share as much of the code as possible on GitHub. Basically, I publish my source code under the <a rel="noopener" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons BY-NC 4.0</a> license, and users can adapt and use it freely for non-profit purposes. By publishing my source code, I allow other people to refer to my production methods. In fact, I’ve often heard that people have made demos based on my code. Getting more chances to discover other demosceners’ great works is valuable for me too, so I’ll continue to publish my source code.</p><p>Also, when I do version control on Git, I try to write commit logs—comments you can add to each version—as detailed as possible. Commit logs explain which part of the code I changed, and they also serve as a kind of production journal. In addition to information like what type of change I made and for what purpose, they help me recall my state of mind or what I was thinking during the creative process.</p><p><strong>For programmers, is it a hassle to write detailed commit logs?</strong></p><p>Commit logs aren’t considered a direct contribution to a program, just like READMEs or documentation. So, engineers who want to focus on coding and dislike communicating often don’t write them at all. Usually, detailed commit logs are recommended when you work with other people on business projects. However, even for a one-off piece of code written by a single person, I think we should consider how detailed we make the commit logs, because someone else—or even yourself—may end up reading them like archaeology.</p><p><strong>Archaeology… that’s interesting. <br> Okay, let me go to the classic question: your favorite demo, a memorable demo, or a demo that changed your life… anything. Tell us about a demo, or demos that are special to you.</strong></p><p>As I mentioned, “<a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5PqEePIghE" target="_blank">Emix</a>” by Epoch is the demo I like the most. From the theme of each effect to the color grading, glitch effects, music, and direction, this piece defined what a demo should have, for me. Other pieces that helped define my standards include “<a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCh3Q08HMfs" target="_blank">cdak</a>” by Quite &amp; Orange, “<a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=mTi0UppWnH8" target="_blank">Transformer 3</a>” by Limp Ninja, and “<a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3T1-nadehU" target="_blank">Clean Slate</a>” by Conspiracy. I put them together in my <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.pouet.net/lists.php?which=242" target="_blank">Pouet playlist “0b5vr’s bible”</a>, if you’re interested.</p><p><strong>Among many other forms of self-expression, why did you choose the demoscene? Or are you trapped by this culture? Tell me what’s so attractive about it.</strong></p><p>The demoscene is a creative activity free from art as a capital asset or from commercial value. We mostly create and present pieces in a format that has little value in today’s society, and we purely inspire one another’s technical curiosity and the craving for expression. Also, the demoscene ecosystem is cooperative. Anyone can access demotools, ask questions to veterans, and start creating a piece. I respect the works, workflows, and ideas of active demosceners in the community, and that’s what motivates me to create something that earns their recognition.</p><p>On the other hand, due to the methods used in the demoscene, a lot of pieces look similar, and that’s clearly a weak point of the scene. If I only keep exploring the demoscene, I can’t expand my range of expression. As a creator, I think it’s important to look at various cultures and absorb many different methods of expression. The easy exchange of fresh inspiration is one of the features of the demoscene, so I’d like to take in many forms of expression both inside and outside the scene, and keep inspiring each other.</p><p><strong>Is there anything you want to do in the future?</strong></p><p>What I want to do most is live music performance using GLSL, as I mentioned. Seemingly, this format of live music with GLSL is currently performed only by me and “<a rel="noopener" href="https://x.com/lactoice251" target="_blank">Rakuto-ice</a>” san. So I want to perform more to develop my style further, and I hope more people will enjoy it.</p><p>And of course, I want to create demos like 64K, but right now I don’t have enough motivation or ideas. To find more motivation and inspiration, I think it’s about time I formed a demogroup.</p><p><strong>Sounds like there’s much to look forward to! </strong><br> <strong>Finally, your message for demosceners and demo fans out there, please.</strong></p><p><em>For those of you who are not yet demosceners:</em> <br> I’ve seen many people who have an interest in the demoscene but also fears about the culture itself. And it’s not just Japanese people, people in other countries have reacted that way too. Please don’t be afraid of us. If you are interested in creating something with a computer and having fun at a demoparty, then you are a demoscener. Whether you already have a medium of expression or not, if you join the party, you may naturally feel inspired to think, “I want to express myself too.” Demoparties like Tokyo Demo Fest, SESSIONS, and Revision have various compos, including simple programs, illustration, photography, music, along with the demo compo. Of course, if you want to create a demo, fellow creators will help you. We demosceners hope you will have fun in this scene.</p><p><em>For those who are already demosceners (including me):</em> <br> Make 64K!</p><hr><p>Thank you very much for answering my question, <a rel="noopener" href="https://0b5vr.com/" target="_blank">0b5vr</a>!</p><p><a rel="noopener" href="https://0b5vr.com/" target="_blank">0b5vr</a>’s works can be found on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.pouet.net/groups.php?which=15409" target="_blank">Pouet</a> and <a rel="noopener" href="https://demozoo.org/sceners/128318/" target="_blank">Demozoo</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/jeff-buys-nissan-leaf-sv-plus.jpg" width="350" height="330" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-a463435a-cfd8-4cbb-976e-31ecec4fadb8" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;a463435a-cfd8-4cbb-976e-31ecec4fadb8&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Jeff Geerling with Nissan Leaf SV Plus at Dealership"></p>

<p>I bought a used 2023 Nissan Leaf in 2025, my first 'new' car in 15 years. The above photo was taken by the dealership; apparently their social media team likes to post photos of all purchasers.</p>

<p>I test drove a Tesla in 2012, and quickly realized my mistake. No gasoline-powered car (outside of supercars, maybe? Never drove one of those) could match the feel of pressing the throttle on an electric.</p>

<p>I started out with a used minivan, which I drove into the ground. Then I bought a used Olds that I drove into the ground. Then I bought a used Camry that I bought before we had kids, when I had a 16 mile commute.</p>

<p>Fast forward about 15 years, and I found myself with a very short commute, only driving a few miles a day, and a family minivan we use for nearly all the 'driving around the kids' stuff.</p>

<p>So I wanted a smaller car (get back a foot or so of garage space...) that was also more efficient.</p>

<h2>Video and GitHub EV Project</h2>

<p>If you don't like reading blog posts (why are you here?), I also posted a video going over most of this, with a little more color, on my YouTube channel:</p>

<div>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hQQtFnLefqw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
</div>

<p>Also, this blog post is also the centerpiece of my new GitHub project <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/electric-car">geerlingguy/electric-car</a>, where I detail all the steps on my nascent EV journey.</p>

<h2>Equipment and Add-ons</h2>

<p>Before I go further, I thought I'd mention some of the things I've added to my Leaf to make the EV experience a little nicer (some links are Amazon affiliate links. I earn for qualifying referrals):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4k0tHwX">Grizzl-E Level 2 Charger</a> for the garage (see <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/electric-car/issues/5">Issue #5</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3HIt2Tx">Lectron L1 J1772 EV charger</a> for a more portable charger, when I just need to top off the car for a few hours</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4l8f4ct">J1772 Wall mount for cable and plug</a> - I was going to 3D print one, but figured the metal product would hold up better in a garage in the midwest</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3T1PQjw">NACS to J1772</a> AC L1/L2 charging adapter</li>
<li><a href="https://a2zevshop.com/products/ccs1-to-chademo">CCS1 to CHAdeMO</a> L3 DC Fast charge adapter (see <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/electric-car/issues/9">Issue #9</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3SW9AVH">CarlinKit 5.0 Wireless CarPlay/Android Auto adapter</a> because the Leaf only supports wired CarPlay by default</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4n8HqEB">VIOFO A119 Mini Dashcam</a> with a <a href="https://amzn.to/44hbi9f">Dongar wiring harness adapter</a> (see <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/electric-car/issues/3">Issue #3</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Monitoring the Battery</h2>

<p>If you're considering a used Leaf, or if you have a Leaf already, it's a good idea to keep tabs on the battery health, especially since the meter on your dash is painfully basic in how much data it provides.</p>

<p>Individual cell charge, 'State of Health' of the overall battery, and much more are available through the car's OBD-II port.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/lelink-2-obd-ii-leaf.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-e0e6e96f-13e0-4309-b60a-30ddc5d90611" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;e0e6e96f-13e0-4309-b60a-30ddc5d90611&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="LeLink 2 OBD-II adapter"></p>

<p>Soon after I bought my Leaf, I ordered a <a href="https://amzn.to/45GYUls">LeLink 2</a> ($35) and bought the <a href="https://leafspy.com/">LeafSpy Pro</a> App for my iPhone ($20).</p>

<p>I plugged the LeLink 2 into the OBD-II diagnostics port under the steering column, and fired up LeafSpy Pro. It gives me some helpful metrics like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>SOH: State of Health</li>
  <li>Hx: Conductance</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/electric-car/issues/8">Issue #8: Document battery health</a> for all my notes monitoring my own Leaf's battery. But bottom line, my battery showed a 93.16% 'SoH' (State of Health), meaning it still has most of its capacity.</p>

<p>I've been reading up on various forums about managing the Leaf's battery, and am trying to do some things to extend the battery's life as long as possible:</p>

<ul>
<li>Limiting the number of QCs (Quick Charges / DC Fast Charge), as this heats up the uncooled Leaf battery, degrading it slightly each time, especially on hotter days</li>
<li>Keeping the charge between 50-80% when manageable</li>
<li>Charging up to 100% at least once a month, and letting it 'top off' to rebalance the pack for at least a few hours afterwards</li>
<li>Not driving like a maniac, despite having more torque in this car than I've ever had in any of my previous cars</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why buy electric?</h2>

<p>I overanalyze most things, so had been researching this purchase for about a decade now.</p>

<p>With EVs there are tradeoffs. Even in my situation, only driving a car a few miles a day, I <em>do</em> take my car on one or two regional road trips every year.</p>

<p>Having the ability to hop in at 6 am and be in Chicago or KC by late morning is nice. Having to plan a long break somewhere halfway to charge is not.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/nissan-leaf-at-evgo-dc-fast-charger.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-69b2a922-baa6-4ac5-8200-da5c90a7ba66" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;69b2a922-baa6-4ac5-8200-da5c90a7ba66&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Nissan Leaf at EVGo DC fast charger"></p>

<p>But if I only take that trip once a year, I can either (a) rent a gas car that gets me there a little more quickly, and ensures I don't have to find a spot in the destination city to do a full charge before the return trip. Or (b) plan for an extra X hours total during the trip to ensure I have padding for charging.</p>

<p>Charging infrastructure's improving in the US (and in many parts of the world), but it's nowhere near as ubiquitous as gas stations.</p>

<p>Hopefully this improves over time, but for now, I plan on using the electric car for local travel, likely only going more than 100 miles or so in a day once or twice a year.</p>

<h2>Why buy Leaf?</h2>

<p>Price.</p>

<p>That's mostly it. And I drove a Nissan Sentra rental on a recent trip, and realized Nissan isn't half bad. They seem to not require an Internet connection for their cars, they offer basic lane following and adaptive cruise control, they have CarPlay/Android Auto...</p>

<p>The Leaf ticks all the little 'convenience' checkboxes, but is also not 'extravagant'.</p>

<p>And the later model years also aren't "look at me I drive an EV" ugly (though they're not amazing-looking, either).</p>

<p>But I drove a minivan, an olds, and a Camry, so obviously I'm function &gt; form when it comes to my car!</p>

<p>Because of the smaller battery (and up until 2026, a battery with no active cooling), combined with the use of a DC fast charging connector (CHAdeMO) that's going out of style in the US, used Nissan Leafs are priced <em>considerably</em> lower than competitors.</p>

<p>Well, all except maybe Teslas around a year or two older right now. But Teslas don't have native CarPlay. And I'm not a fan of how Tesla is trying to turn the car into some kind of appliance, RoboTaxi, self-driving thing, versus it being a transportation vehicle that I can do what I want with.</p>

<p>No judgement on Tesla owners, the used Tesla market was enticing at the time I bought the Leaf.</p>

<p>I also looked a lot at the Hyundai Ioniq and Kona; both were just a <em>little</em> bit too large for my liking, but they could've worked. The problem was used models in good condition were a lot more expensive than I was willing to pay.</p>

<p>So back to the Leaf: Nissan's probably not the <em>best</em> right now when it comes to EVs and features, but they're certainly the <em>cheapest</em>. And 'good enough' is fine by me.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/nissan-leaf-ev-interior.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-af9f7f15-eae6-4aff-ba12-43507758d0df" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;af9f7f15-eae6-4aff-ba12-43507758d0df&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Nissan Leaf interior driver's side"></p>

<p><em>She's got it where it counts, kid.</em></p>

<h2>Gripes about my Leaf</h2>

<p>There are a few things that baffle me about the Leaf, some that have been frustrating from the first test drive; others that are more subtle:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>There is no 'play/pause' button.</strong> Anywhere. At least not on the steering wheel or the display area. You have to go into the music section on the entertainment display, <em>then</em> press the software play/pause button. That's dumb. I've resorted to just turning Audio on/off using the volume knob, which accomplishes the same goal but is not always ideal.</li>
<li><strong>Going into 'Neutral' is an exercise in frustration.</strong> I thought you just put your foot on the brake and move the shifter knob to the left. But you have to do it with the right timing, I think.</li>
<li><strong>There's no way to open the tailgate short of pressing the release button.</strong> At least as far as I'm aware. There's no button in the cabin or key fob to unlatch it. The manual says the other way to open it is with a screwdriver, from inside the car, pushing on the latch (lol). <a href="https://mynissanleaf.com/threads/leaf-doesnt-have-an-interior-trunk-release.5026/">I'm not alone here</a>. At least there's a button on the remote to open the charge port.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The joy of electric</h2>

<p>I don't care about engine noise. I appreciate it, though. My brother had a 1992 Forumula Firebird. And I nearly owned it after he moved away, instead of my Olds! (But I'm a boring-car person, so I think I was happier with the Olds).</p>

<p>The nice things about electric vehicles that swayed me in their favor, in descending order:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>One pedal driving</strong> Seriously, why doesn't every EV have this mode? It makes driving one feel SO much better than any gas car, in terms of connection between driver and car movement.</li>
<li><strong>Sprightly torque</strong>: Outside of exotic tiny gas cars, you're not going to get the same zip even a cheap EV like a Leaf gives you—smash the accelerator in non-Eco mode and any passenger will giggle, every time.</li>
<li><strong>Blissful quiet</strong>: Though some cars have annoying noises (Nissan calls this VSP, or "Vehicle Sound for Pedestirians") they play at low speeds.</li>
<li><strong>Lower maintenance requirements</strong>: I hate every time I have to jack up my car and change the brakes, or take it in for oil/fluid changes. EVs (usually) require less maintenance, besides maybe tires.</li>
<li><strong>Conveniences</strong>: Like running climate control to cool down/heat up the car prior to hopping in, even while it's in the garage! Or plugging it in to charge at home, and not having to stop by a gas station.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term economics</strong>: in <em>general</em>, charging with electricity, at least here in St. Louis, is cheaper than filling up with gas, on a dollar-per-mile basis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The pain of electric</h2>

<p>All that said, I knew going into this there would be some pain. Maybe in 10 or 20 years these things will get solved, but off the top of my head:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Price</strong>: The Leaf (especially used, right now) is the cheapest, but it is by no means <em>cheap</em>. It takes a few years to break even with a similarly-specced gas car. But buying a gas car, you have a lot more options on the low-low end.</li>
<li><strong>Range Anxiety</strong>: Yes, it's overblown, but no, it's not non-existent. The day I <em>bought</em> my used EV, the dealership (which doesn't sell many EVs, even new) didn't have a 'Level 3' DC fast charger—and they had only charged it to about 16%. Letting it top off at L2 while I was dealing with finance, we got to 23%. I wasn't quite sure I'd make it home off the lot! Luckily I did, with 12 miles of range remaining. Road tripping or day trips require more planning when driving an EV.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of standards</strong>: For 'L3' DC Fast Charging, the Leaf has a CHAdeMO port. Teslas and many newer EVs have NACS. Then there's CCS1 and CCS2. And charging stations are run by multiple vendors with multiple apps and payment methods. It's not like gas stations, like with Shell, BP, Buckee's, etc. where you just drive up, stick the gas nozzle in your tank, and squeeze. Even adapters can be complicated and annoying, and many EV charging stations only support one or two standards—and some may only have <em>one</em> CHAdeMO plug, and that plug may have been ripped off the unit to be scrapped by a copper thief!</li>
<li><strong>Lack of standards, part 2</strong>: For L1/L2 charging, some cars use J1772, some use NACS... and then wall charging units are all over the board with supporting 6, 12, or 16 Amps for L1 (they shouldn't do 16 on a 15A circuit but it seems like some do!), or various different amperages for L2. Some of these units require apps to configure them, others have dip switches, and yet others are not configurable, and don't list their exact specs in an easy-to-find location. Usually forum posts from users who <em>buy</em> the chargers offer more information than product manufacturers' own websites!</li>
<li><strong>Being an EV</strong>: For some reason, most EVs look like... EVs. I honestly was holding out hope Tesla would just make a Corolla, but an EV version. All the cheap EVs like the Bolt, i3, Leaf, etc. just look... sorta ugly. Subjective, sure, but at least my Olds looked kinda sleek. Even if it was an Olds. EVs stand out, and that I don't enjoy. I want an EV that looks like a Camry. Just blend in and don't stand out.</li>
<li><strong>Cables and chargers</strong>: The Leaf has slightly less trunk space than my slightly-larger Camry. I didn't realize how big L1/L2 charge cables are. Even L1-only cables (which charge at a very anemic pace, like 10 miles / hour of charge) are fairly thick, bulky affairs. About 1/10 of my trunk is devoted to my charging cable. And on a road trip, I will likely carry my <a href="https://amzn.to/3T1PQjw">NACS to J1772</a> and <a href="https://a2zevshop.com/products/ccs1-to-chademo">CCS1 to CHAdeMO</a> adapters. And the latter adapter includes its <em>own</em> battery (that has to be charged) and firmware (that might need to be updated)!</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't plan on becoming an EV advocate by any means.</p>

<p>The Leaf is the perfect option for me, but I wouldn't recommend an EV for most car owners yet, especially considering the price disparity and infrastructure requirements that exclude large swaths of the population!</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<h4 id="2">What is AV and why it doesn't work</h4>
<p>“Age verification” (AV) is the requirement for online platforms to implement strict methods to verify the age of their users, in order to prevent minors from accessing adult content.</p>
<p>By “strict,” we mean methods such as ID uploads, facial age estimation, credit card checks, or mobile operator verification. The allowed methods vary depending on the country.</p>
<p>At face value, it may sound reasonable — even like a good idea.</p>
<p>However, there are countless problems with it — many of which have been pointed out by credible observers, repeatedly.</p>
<p>Note that there has never been any credible evidence that site-level AV works either (especially when done selectively, like it has), while there have been countless warnings and demonstrations that it doesn’t.</p>
<p>Everywhere AV has been implemented, we’ve seen the same pattern: a handful of large porn sites are targeted (usually, us and Pornhub) — sometimes with a few token smaller sites — and that’s it.</p>
<p>The one and only so-called “argument” in favor of AV is that it’s been used for gambling and other restricted services, so it could be applied to porn. But that comparison is dishonest: on a gambling or merchant site, users already expect to submit personal data — credit card info, name, phone number, address. They are paying for something.<br>On a free site, users do not expect to hand over private data. They simply refuse — and move on to other sites. Why wouldn’t they?</p>
<p>AV is instantly and effortlessly circumvented: porn remains accessible through search engines, social media, messaging apps, file-sharing (direct and peer-to-peer), VPNs, proxies, and an astronomical number of adult sites — it’s conservative to estimate there are over a million. Some users might even be tempted to turn to the dark web to escape this wave of state overreach — though we certainly don’t recommend it.</p>
<p>Not only is porn still available from all these channels — but the largest, most obvious mainstream platforms that host or link to porn are systematically exempted or spared enforcement.<br>That alone should make anyone question the real motivations behind these regulations. We’re told it’s about protecting children — but the sites most known and most used by children, and which host porn, are conveniently untouched?</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="3">What will happen?</h4>
<p>We’ll have to implement AV wherever it is legally mandated. It’s not like we have a choice. Legal challenges were our only option — but now, even the courts have been swept up in the hysteria.</p>
<p>The largest established adult sites, such as ours, will be immediately destroyed.</p>
<p>We know that only about 10% of the user base will remain after AV is implemented — and the 10% who stay (thanks, by the way) are very costly to verify.</p>
<p>So much so that we expect to operate at a financial loss.</p>
<p><strong>[Added July 4th] Here are real numbers that are the results of currently running AV tests :&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>July 4th : verification rate : 10,5% (89,5% of users gone)</strong><br><strong>July 3th : verification rate : 9,7% (91,3% of users gone)</strong><br><strong>July 2nd : verification rate even lower due to technical issues.<br>However, keep in mind that the drop of users is (maybe significantly) higher than shown, because the ones who simply don't return (because they know there is an AV wall), are not counted.</strong></p>
<p>This will completely distorts competition, as our visitors will switch to various other sites and services that did nothing to earn them. Preserving fair competition is one of the obligations of most states — but they simply don’t give a fuck about it. Right now, there are almost 3,000 (not an exaggeration) clones of our sites — not owned by us, but designed to look like our platforms, sometimes with a different makeover — stealing our content, and soon to be massively rewarded.</p>
<p>Regulators have no clue where people will go — but what’s likely is that users will scatter across so many sites, apps, proxies, and channels that they’ll become untraceable, guaranteeing the failure of future regulations. And unlike today, many of those new destinations will be dangerous, unmoderated, and openly hostile to enforcement.</p>
<p>People will massively move to VPNs (some of them are permanently free but with with slower speeds). You'd think it would absorb some of the losses, but VPNs nowadays integrate ad-blocking features, effectively ripping off content creators and us. Concretely, VPNs are pushing us even further in the negative.</p>
<p>Adult companies are already treated as barely tolerated, second-class entities, and every form of unfair treatment and discrimination has long been prevalent — in banking, for example. Digital exclusion through regulation was already a reality for adult sites — but AV will deepen this unequal treatment, pushing them out through reputational and compliance burdens.</p>
<p>So it will become impossible for any large, free adult platform to exist. This very business model is driven to extinction.</p>
<p>A new landscape will emerge — devoid of established, safe, and large adult sites where legitimate content creators can showcase their work and be rewarded for it. They will be penalized along with us.</p>
<p>All the years of “trust and safety” efforts from the largest adult platform — all trashed.</p>
<p>Favoring verified channels → no more<br>Payouts to content owners → gone<br>Piracy prevention through fingerprinting → gone<br>Verifying all uploaded content → for nothing<br>Cooperation with authorities → useless with no users left</p>
<p>We also predict that if AV is forced onto smaller merchants, it will destroy them too — they won’t even get a chance to show their content before users bail out, unwilling to pass yet another fucking age verification. And these merchants won’t have a chance to present their content on our platforms either — like they used to — because we’ll be gone.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it’s only a matter of time before user databases are hacked and leaked. Even recently, huge platforms with the best technological capabilities had massive password databases leaked.</p>
<p>We also expect that at some point in the future (though it may take years) — especially once parents realize they’ve been SCAMMED, that their children are no safer online, and that charlatans lied to them all along — AV regulations will be exported to devices and app stores, while remaining an oglibation for platforms, effectively forcing users to identify themselves over and over again.</p>
<p>It seems to genuinely please anti-porn activists to force adults to endure these repeated little humiliations — like having to do a face scan before viewing content.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="4">The scam</h4>
<p data-start="92" data-end="194">Let’s be clear: AV enforcement is meant to be such a burden on porn companies that it destroys them.</p>
<p data-start="201" data-end="600" data-is-last-node="">For merchant sites, AV could be handled relatively easily by banks and credit card companies — they already know who’s over 18. But of course not. Instead, regulators dump the burden onto the sites themselves — the ones with zero identity data, and outnumbering banks by a lot, multiplying the risks related to implementation. The logic? Force those least capable of verifying age to do it anyway — then blame them when it fails.</p>
<p>What’s going on is obvious: “protecting children” is a false pretense. AV is being used to attack porn and those who watch it. It was never about children. It was always driven by anti-porn crusaders and control-obsessed ideologues.<br>These same people pretend to stand on a moral high ground, while lying through their teeth about their true intentions.</p>
<p>Citing “child protection” is an effective tactic to silence critics. If you oppose AV — even for sound, technical reasons — you’re immediately hit with emotional blackmail and cheap outrage.</p>
<p>Another “argument” we hear commonly to defend AV is: “At least we’re doing something.”<br>Yes — something ineffective, destructive, and stupid. Passing laws that don’t work, wasting everyone’s time, wrecking legitimate businesses and killing competition — all so some politician, bureaucrat, or activist can pose as a force for good, or satisfy their hatred.</p>
<p>We are the sacrificial lamb of this story — the scapegoat in a very bad political play.</p>
<p>We — and our content creators — are being sacrificed for nothing. User privacy is being sacrificed for nothing. Children and adults will actually be less safe after we are gone.</p>
<p>Announcements about site-based AV give parents the illusion that their kids are protected, when in reality, nothing changes. Porn will still be everywhere.</p>
<p>It’s an absolute joke — a placebo solution pushed by imbeciles who clearly don’t give a shit about minors.</p>
<p>Device-level parental controls have existed for years, and can actually block a million sites. But politicians can’t take credit for them. So instead of empowering parents, lawmakers give them a headline and a false promise.</p>
<p>Watch these pricks go on TV or social media and pat themselves on the back for “making the internet safer” — while anyone can still run a basic Google search and instantly find billions of porn images. Bold-faced liars.</p>
<p>The one “good” thing about AV is that it’s a clear sign of political incompetence. If your lawmakers passed this kind of law, you can be sure they’re either corrupt, lying to you, stupid — or some combination of all three. At least it makes them easier to spot.</p>
<p>It might make some sense — even if we’d still disagree (because there are better solutions, see below) — to enforce AV on major mainstream platforms to prevent accidental exposure to porn. But the hypocrites in charge are systematically and deliberately sparing those platforms.</p>
<p>How is this not outright fraud, to wage regulatory war against us, while pretending not to see the porn flooding search engines, social media, gaming platforms, and messaging apps?</p>
<p>Make no mistake: we mention mainstream sites only to highlight the hypocrisy. Enforcing AV on them wouldn't work either, because users would simply migrate to countless other sites happy to absorb the traffic. It will always the established platforms that get punished, all for a measure that cannot work.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="5">What to do then?</h4>
<p>We agree with Meta (Facebook, Instagram), Aylo (Pornhub), and many others that the only effective solution to the problem of minors accessing porn is a systematic approach — applied at the device level, or at least at a higher layer than individual sites, such as app stores.</p>
<p>There are many ways to implement AV at the device level — and there’s no question that any of them would be far more effective than site-based AV. Because they apply system-wide, device-level controls scale across all apps and browsers — not just one site at a time.</p>
<p>However, we don’t share Aylo’s position — or others’ — that Google and Apple necessarily need to implement something new. Traditional parental controls have existed for ages, they work, and their usage can easily be expanded, as we explain further below.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that neither Google nor Apple seem interested in implementing AV directly on their operating systems. Instead, they apparently prefer to offload the responsibility to each individual service, app, or website — separately and redundantly. But their position might change. Things are happening as we write, for example, Google just announced (July 1st, 2025), a partnership with an <a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/we-are-announcing-sparkasse-as-our-first-national-credential-partner-for-eu-age-assurance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AV provider</a>.</p>
<p>In any case, it’s mind-boggling that platforms are punished, adults are forced to take privacy risks, and everyone is expected to endure a disastrous user experience — all because we’re supposed to accept that it’s “too difficult” for parents to spend two minutes setting up parental controls.</p>
<p>And if some parents struggle with tech, the answer is education and support — not mass surveillance and regulatory theater.</p>
<p>In reality, this is just the state outsourcing its child-protection duties to private companies, who are now expected to police everyone else’s kids.</p>
<p>Shifting responsibility away from parents is exactly the wrong direction. Critics say we can’t rely on all parents — and that may be true — but there is a way to ensure all of them are involved.</p>
<p>That solution is simple: require all parents to install a parental control app — and have teachers verify its presence in school, once a year. The app could display a small icon on the home screen, making it instantly visible without needing to unlock the device.</p>
<p>We believe that’s the safest, most effective, and only sane global solution. Of course, opponents will say it’s “too difficult” — as if we don’t already expect parents to do far more, like checking homework or even just cooking for them. But then again, all reason has long since left this debate. “Child” is now a magic word that vaporizes logic the moment it’s spoken.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="6">Are sex and porn really harmful?</h4>
<p>The idea that adult content is inherently harmful to teenagers is a fallacy. In social sciences, it’s always possible to find a study that supports almost any conclusion.</p>
<p>In fact, Ofcom (UK regulator for AV) acknowledges that research into pornography’s impact on children is limited and inconclusive — prompting calls for further study.</p>
<p>It’s a debate very similar to the old panic over video game or movie violence — where the consensus today is that these things are not inherently harmful.</p>
<p>This is a textbook case of moral panic. We've seen it before — over rock music, comic books, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, rap lyrics, and video games. Each time, fear was whipped up around the idea that a new form of media would corrupt “the youth.” And each time, the panic faded once it became obvious that society had not collapsed. Today’s AV push is just the latest version of that same irrational reflex.</p>
<p>It says a lot about a society that will move faster to restrict the viewing of sex — a universal and natural human drive — than it will to ban depictions of torture, murder, bombings, or decapitations.</p>
<p>Religions and ideologies have long exploited the universality of sexual desire to instill guilt — because guilt is a powerful tool of control.</p>
<p>Some claim that porn “isn’t real sex” — but porn is simply a representation of the fantasies that exist in our societies. And fantasies often reveal far more about who we really are, and want, than the polite masks we wear in the so-called “real world.”</p>

<hr>
<p>In the following sections, we are discussing what happened in certain countries or regions.</p>

<h4 id="7">The United Kingdom</h4>
<p>In the West, it was the UK that first attempted to implement AV, starting around 2015.</p>
<p>But even before that, the UK had enforced ISP-level porn blocking by default. Users must log into their ISP or mobile provider account to opt out. These filters apply at the household or device level, meaning most internet connections in the UK are already filtered — unless someone deliberately disables the block.</p>
<p>So why add site-level AV on top of that?</p>
<p>The government claims it’s needed to catch edge cases — but in reality, it's about shifting responsibility away from parents and ISPs, and dumping it onto websites like ours. This, despite the fact that a parent already had to take conscious steps to enable access to adult content for their household, and was prompted to set up parental controls on every device they purchased.</p>
<p>Now, even after that explicit decision, users will be forced to go through site-level AV — potentially dozens of times — just to access the content they’ve already unlocked at the ISP level. This creates an absurd and invasive double burden, for no measurable gain in protection.</p>
<p>Critics have rightly called this system redundant, ineffective, and a threat to privacy. But the government pushed ahead anyway — not because it works, but because it looks like action. It’s political theater, designed to produce headlines, not results.</p>
<p>The timeline of the restriction of access to adult content in the UK:</p>
<p><strong>2013</strong> (late): Default ISP filtering begins across major providers.</p>
<p><strong>2015:</strong> AV laws introduced via the Digital Economy Act.</p>
<p><strong>2019:</strong> AV implementation scrapped amid concerns over privacy, enforcement feasibility, and data security.</p>
<p><strong>2020–2022:</strong> AV advocates and the Age Verification Providers Association lobby relentlessly for revival.</p>
<p><strong>2022–2023:</strong> AV re-emerges under the Online Safety Bill, now part of a broader regulatory framework.</p>
<p><strong>2023:</strong> Online Safety Act passes, embedding AV into law — despite having been shelved just four years earlier for good reasons.</p>
<p><strong>July 2025:</strong> AV is scheduled to take effect.</p>
<p>Despite being scrapped in the UK for good reasons, AV has since been blindly copied by lawmakers in France, the US, Germany, Italy, and Spain — as if the failure never happened, in a race to the bottom.</p>
<p>One rare redeeming aspect is that the UK allows for SMS-based verification — one of the least intrusive verification methods, and the one our users preferred, according to a large-scale survey in France.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the UK will apply AV intelligently (as much as a dumb measure allows) and universally, or simply use it to crush a few adult sites and declare mission accomplished. But if the past is any indication, we already know the answer.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="8">The United States</h4>
<p>At least 20 U.S. states have now passed age verification laws.</p>
<p>There were strong reasons to believe these laws were unconstitutional under U.S. law. As the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union) noted: “The Supreme Court repeatedly heard cases on this issue in the past — many brought by the ACLU — and consistently held that requiring users to verify their age to access protected content is unconstitutional when less restrictive alternatives, like filtering software, are available.”</p>
<p>For example: <em>Reno v. ACLU</em> (1997), <em>Ashcroft v. ACLU</em> (COPA I, 2002), <em>Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition</em> (2002), <em>Ashcroft v. ACLU</em> (COPA II, 2004), and <em>Florence v. Shurtleff</em> (2021).</p>
<p>So the <em>Free Speech Coalition</em> (an adult industry group) challenged Texas’s law, taking the case all the way to the Supreme Court — once again.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, on June 27, 2025, a divided SCOTUS — with a majority led by Justice Thomas — ruled 6–3 against its own precedent, claiming that “times have changed” and lowering the standard for suppressing certain speech.</p>
<p>This 6–3 split, with conservative justices outvoting the liberal ones, has become common in recent rulings.</p>
<p>In a forceful dissent, Justice Kagan argued that Texas’s AV law invades privacy by requiring ID or personal data submission to unknown entities, chills lawful speech — as adults will self-censor rather than risk exposure — and should be held unconstitutional under strict scrutiny due to its broad and intrusive design.</p>
<p>We previously wrote that SCOTUS was allowing AV with minimal constraints — but in reality, it’s more like no constraints. Judge for yourself:</p>
<p>Privacy: States are not required to offer privacy-preserving options. ID upload mandates are permitted without limits on data retention or third-party handling.</p>
<p>Speech burden: The Court dropped strict scrutiny in favor of intermediate scrutiny, meaning heavy burdens on adult access are tolerated.</p>
<p>Efficacy: States are not required to show that AV is effective, nor to prefer less restrictive alternatives like parental controls.</p>
<p>In short, the ruling removes nearly all federal constitutional barriers to AV laws — unless they are wildly overbroad or irrational, which is a very high bar.</p>
<p>We are particularly shocked that the SCOTUS now allows individual states to pass laws known not to work — even when better alternatives exist — effectively protecting state-level incompetence and/or hidden agendas.</p>
<p>The “do it for the kids”, emotional yet empty argument was successfully used to strip away your rights.</p>
<p>Now, minors and adults alike will be durably less safe, with less freedom and more state control.</p>
<p>By the way, Texas’s penalties are so extreme — many times higher than in any other state — that they cross the line into punitive, chilling, and constitutionally disproportionate enforcement.</p>
<p>Based on Texas’s insane $10,000-per-day penalty, and assuming one million adult sites currently lack AV, the State of Texas stands to gain ~$6,000,000,000,000 — that’s 6 trillion dollars — more than what the entire industry has ever made, worldwide, and counting. As we said before: all reason is long gone.</p>
<p>Now consider this: Texas (and other states) act tough on adult companies in the name of protecting minors. That much is certain.</p>
<p>But they also voted to exempt search engines and social media — so those platforms can happily continue distributing as much porn as they want. And those are exactly the sites minors use from a young age. Isn’t that “wonderful”? Hypocrisy? Charlatanism? You be the judge.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="9">France</h4>
<p>French AV is the poster child for everything that’s wrong with age verification — the worst implementation imaginable.</p>
<p>This idiotic law was passed by so-called moderate political parties (first and foremost the party of President Macron), while so-called “extreme” parties, both left and right, opposed it with reasonable arguments.</p>
<p>We were initially attacked even before the law came into effect, as shown in our <a href="https://pornbiz.com/post/11/france_les_enfants_le_sexe_et_la_violence">previous blog post</a> (in French). Later, we were attacked again for failing to implement AV — even though the guidelines hadn’t yet been produced. Absolute hysteria. They COULD NOT WAIT to go after us. For some reason, it tends to be people from your own country who plant the knife in your back.</p>
<p>ARCOM — the body in charge of defining platform obligations and oversight — demands that users be verified on every single visit or session. This multiplies AV costs (they couldn't care less) and creates unnecessary friction that drives users away. They do not care in the slightest.</p>
<p>Another incredibly dumb feature of France’s AV system is its ban on credit card use — even though credit cards are one of the best tools for merchants, enabling them to both verify age and acquire a paying customer at the same time.</p>
<p>Their so-called “double anonymity” standard is a lie too. Platforms are required to pay AV providers — so of course those providers know which site the user is verifying for.</p>
<p>Since the initial law was passed in 2020, we’ve heard policymakers and AV proponents say again and again that they “don’t care how it’s done.” They are blinded by one goal: to see us destroyed. We imagine them foaming at the mouth, eagerly anticipating our demise through “regulation.”</p>
<p>The French government also shows zero concern for the disruption of competition.</p>
<p>What’s particularly disturbing is that French journalists never ask how AV will actually protect minors — or whether it’s normal for any free site implementing it to instantly lose almost all of its users. No one questions why the government consistently protects the biggest mainstream platforms, which are flooded with porn. Instead, they repeat simplistic talking points like “it’s just like showing your ID at a club” — a comparison that is utterly absurd when applied to the internet.</p>
<p>All of this is reinforced by years of media-driven demonization of porn — particularly in left-wing newspapers and state-funded TV and radio. We documented the many lies in just one French TV broadcast in a previous blog post.</p>
<p>Just in the past few weeks, we’ve been accused in three separate French news articles of:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Being cybersquatters (Libération),</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Being spies with ties to Ukraine (Intelligence Online),</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Producing “extremely violent” content (Mediapart).</p>
<p>All of these claims are complete fabrications — but French journalists are so protected that suing them is a pointless exercise. In court, they don’t even have to prove that what they wrote is true — only that they “worked semi-seriously” on their so-called reporting. It’s a very low standard that French courts have repeatedly upheld, for the sake of protecting real journalism.</p>
<p>We’ve also been relentlessly harassed by the French state in recent years — clearly as revenge for protesting their idiotic laws.</p>
<p>Know this: the French state is riddled with extremist ideologues, including institutions like the <em>Haute Autorité pour l’Égalité entre les femmes et les hommes</em>, which published a report suggesting that all porn is criminal. For some reason, only radical, misandrist feminists seem to be appointed to lead that agency.</p>
<p>The idea that porn should be restricted because it is supposedly violent or harmful is repeated in every country — but nowhere is that narrative pushed harder than in France, where the state holds a particularly regressive view of sex work. They want it completely marginalized — failing to understand that it is the opposite policies that would clean up both the streets and the websites.</p>
<p>When Pornhub exited France, former “Minister of the Internet” (now Foreign Minister) Jean-Noël Barrot publicly celebrated, saying “Good riddance.” The French government doesn’t care that the most regulated websites are being driven out. That tells you everything: their goal is not safety — it’s the dismantling of the adult industry, which they treat as criminal.</p>
<p>In short, the French state has proven itself deeply incompetent — and the French media no better. We are talking about hundreds of people in Parliament, in the press, and in regulatory bodies who have either failed to recognize the glaring flaws of AV — or have willfully closed their eyes.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="10">The European Union</h4>
<p>As you may have heard, the EU has passed far-reaching laws to supervise and control internet companies, known as the Digital Services Act (DSA), which imposes extra obligations on so-called Very Large Online Platforms (VLOPs).</p>
<p>We were designated as a VLOP — based on inaccurate traffic data (reliable figures were impossible to compute due to incognito sessions) — but chose to engage constructively, expecting fair and equal treatment — we were wrong.</p>
<p>This forced us to allocate significant resources adapting to the DSA — especially to meet its transparency obligations, which we accepted in good faith, recognizing the demand for more openness. As for matters like content moderation and user safety, we were already exceeding expectations.</p>
<p>Then, on May 27, 2025, the EU Commission launched a loud, preemptive public “probe” into adult VLOPs, including us — without any prior warning or dialogue. The issue at hand? Alleged failures to protect minors.</p>
<p>Instead of contacting us directly — as they reportedly did with non-adult platforms facing other regulatory concerns — they tipped off major media outlets in advance. Some journalists were better informed than we were, even before we received formal notice.</p>
<p>This happened even before the EU’s own consultation on AV policy had closed (deadline: June 10, 2025). In other words, we were being punished for not solving a problem the EU was still seeking advice on.</p>
<p>This wasn’t about solving problems anyway. It was a reputational hit campaign, engineered for maximum media exposure rather than constructive engagement. A textbook case of double standards: one for politically untouchable platforms, and another for us.</p>
<p>Judging by this level of hostility, it’s clear the EU is eager to harm the few European VLOPs that exist.</p>
<p>But what is this really about?</p>
<p>Under the DSA, VLOPs must assess and mitigate so-called “systemic risks” — including risks to democratic processes, public health, minors, and fundamental rights. In theory, this sounds reasonable. In practice, it’s dangerously vague.</p>
<p>Critics have warned that the DSA’s “systemic risk” rules force platforms to confess to vague, undefined dangers — with no clarity on how disclosures will be judged. The EU can then claim: “You admitted the risk but didn’t fix it,” and impose crushing fines.</p>
<p>This setup invites regulatory overreach, political pressure, and selective punishment — all without proper safeguards.</p>
<p>Especially in the U.S., experts have described this as granting the EU quasi-judicial powers over global platforms, which can be abused to push agendas on sensitive topics like misinformation, gender identity, or adult content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s exactly what’s happening. The Commission is twisting vague systemic-risk provisions to punish us for not implementing something as risky as site-level age verification (AV) — despite AV being unproven, unscalable, and deeply problematic.</p>
<p>This also blatantly violates the EU’s own principle of proportionality: AV is ineffective, burdensome, and invasive. But by targeting adult platforms first, the Commission likely expects less resistance from the courts than if similar pressure were applied to mainstream giants.</p>
<p>The Commission also said it will “encourage” national authorities to go after smaller adult sites too. Should that really happen, we have to expect an exodus of European companies, to move outside of the EU.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in a shocking display of selective enforcement and discrimination, other VLOPs — many of which host vast amounts of adult content — remain untouched, even though they’ve been under DSA supervision for longer than us.</p>
<p>Henna Virkkunen (Executive Vice-President of the European Commission) stated: “Our rules are very fair, because they are the same for everybody.” But rules mean nothing if enforcement is politicized or selectively applied.</p>
<p>This bias raises serious questions: Is it ideology? Incompetence? Lobbying influence? Or something else entirely?</p>
<p>Even worse: the Commission is pushing AV mandates before its own official “Digital Identity Wallet” — which includes a built-in age verification mechanism — is even functional. So why attack platforms now?</p>
<p>Perhaps this is about forcing the adoption of the EU’s future tools, by creating artificial crises today.</p>
<p>Former EU Digital Commissioner Thierry Breton publicly reprimanded France twice for pursuing a national AV system, saying the EU was working on a unified approach. But if that’s the case, why undermine platforms before that system exists?</p>
<p>The EU Commission is upholding its reputation for ideological rigidity and lack of pragmatism. It's also increasingly viewed as adopting totalitarian measures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>November 2024, Věra Jourová (from the Czech Republic), then outgoing EU Vice-President, cautioned the Commission against “overreaching” and “nannying” citizens. We wish she would have been heard.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="11">Conclusion</h4>
<p>The current moral panic about porn (and social media) is showing the limits of the political and media systems of the West — when even a relatively simple issue like minors accessing adult content is handled this poorly.</p>
<p>We say “the system” rather than individual people, because the outcome was nearly identical in every country, regardless of political leaning.</p>
<p>And by “poorly,” we mean without any rational, pragmatic approach.</p>
<p>The debates were dominated by emotional appeals and pathetically flawed reasoning, delivered by ever-panicking actors — while the many logical arguments against AV were simply ignored.<br>This wasn’t policymaking — it was media-fueled hysteria, where fear, outrage, and clickbait replaced evidence, expertise, and basic logic.</p>
<p>Anti-porn activists played a central role. They’ve been trying to nuke porn for decades — and now they’ve partly succeeded.<br>Their tactics relied on misrepresenting AV’s effectiveness and attacking the morality of anyone who dared to question their “protect the children” narrative.<br>They pushed their agenda without the slightest accountability for blatant falsehoods — like claiming “AV works.”</p>
<p>The press, far and wide, didn’t challenge any of it. Journalists let grotesque claims go unchecked, abandoning the scrutiny they claim to stand for.<br>But they were likely too busy with their usual political propaganda routines.<br>Some even went out of their way to demonize porn sites — fabricating storylines and spreading outright lies.</p>
<p>If you’ve read everything up to this point, we invite you to pick any news article about AV, and see for yourself just how pathetically bad the coverage is.</p>
<p>Watching all this unfold, we don’t even want to imagine how more complex problems are being handled — there’s every reason to believe it’s even worse, as ideology has replaced common sense entirely.</p>
<p>It’s long been our view that the way a society treats porn is a strong indicator of how free it truly is. And on that front, we can say one thing with certainty: freedom is regressing everywhere.</p>
<p>Censorship is rampant — but that’s a topic for another time, if anything is left by then.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="12">TLDR</h4>
<p data-start="141" data-end="381">The idiocracy has won. AV is coming into force across multiple countries — many around the same time. We'll be forced to verify your age, and we already know we'll lose almost all our users in the process.</p>
<p data-start="383" data-end="590">Only a few sites like ours are being targeted, so porn will remain available everywhere else. Minors won’t be safer — just redirected to social media platforms or darker, unregulated corners of the internet.</p>
<p data-start="592" data-end="749">This is the result of an ongoing moral panic, carried by dishonest ideologues, opportunistic politicians, and a media class that thrives on fear and outrage.</p>
<p data-start="751" data-end="920" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">We're witnessing censorship disguised as “protection,” incompetence dressed up as virtue, and a total collapse of rational policymaking. And everyone will pay the price.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        <main>
<h2>Fil's Unbelievable Garbage Collector</h2>

<p>Fil-C uses a <em>parallel concurrent on-the-fly grey-stack Dijkstra accurate non-moving</em> garbage collector called FUGC (Fil's Unbelievable Garbage Collector). You can find the source code for the collector itself in <a href="https://github.com/pizlonator/fil-c/blob/deluge/libpas/src/libpas/fugc.c">fugc.c</a>, though be warned, that code cannot possibly work without lots of support logic in the rest of the runtime and in the compiler.</p>

<p>Let's break down FUGC's features:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Parallel: marking and sweeping happen in multiple threads, in parallel. The more cores you have, the
faster the collector finishes.</p></li>
<li><p>Concurrent: marking and sweeping happen on some threads other than the <em>mutator</em> threads (i.e. your
program's threads). Mutator threads don't have to stop and wait for the collector. The interaction
between the collector thread and mutator threads is mostly non-blocking (locking is only used on
allocation slow paths).</p></li>
<li><p>On-the-fly: there is no global stop-the-world, but instead we use
"soft handshakes" (aka "ragged safepoints"). This means that the GC may ask threads to do some work (like scan stack), but threads do this
asynchronously, on their own time, without waiting for the collector or other threads. The only "pause"
threads experience is the callback executed in response to the soft handshake, which does work bounded
by that thread's stack height. That "pause" is usually shorter than the slowest path you might take
through a typical <code>malloc</code> implementation.</p></li>
<li><p>Grey-stack: the collector assumes it must rescan thread stacks to fixpoint. That is, GC starts with
a soft handshake to scan stack, and then marks in a loop. If this
loop runs out of work, then FUGC does another soft handshake. If that reveals more objects, then
concurrent marking resumes. This prevents us from having a <em>load barrier</em> (no instrumentation runs
when loading a pointer from the heap into a local variable). Only a <em>store barrier</em> is
necessary, and that barrier is very simple. This fixpoint converges super quickly because all newly
allocated objects during GC are pre-marked.</p></li>
<li><p>Dijkstra: storing a pointer field in an object that's in the heap or in a global variable while FUGC
is in its marking phase causes the newly pointed-to object to get marked. This is called a <em>Dijkstra
barrier</em> and it is a kind of <em>store barrier</em>. Due to the grey stack, there is no load barrier like
in the <a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/garbage.pdf">classic Dijkstra collector</a>. The FUGC store
barrier uses a compare-and-swap with relaxed memory ordering on the slowest path (if the GC is running
and the object being stored was not already marked).</p></li>
<li><p>Accurate: the GC accurately (aka precisely, aka exactly) finds all pointers to objects, nothing more,
nothing less. <code>llvm::FilPizlonator</code> ensures that the runtime always knows where the root pointers are
on the stack and in globals. The Fil-C runtime has a clever API and Ruby code generator for tracking
pointers in low-level code that interacts with pizlonated code. All objects know where their outgoing
pointers are - they can only be in the <a href="https://fil-c.org/invisicaps.html">InvisiCap</a> auxiliary allocation.</p></li>
<li><p>Non-moving: the GC doesn't move objects. This makes concurrency easy to implement and avoids
a lot of synchronization between mutator and collector. However, FUGC will "move" pointers to free
objects (it will repoint the <a href="https://fil-c.org/invisicaps.html">capability</a> pointer to the free singleton so it doesn't have to mark the
freed allocation).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This makes FUGC an <em>advancing wavefront</em> garbage collector. Advancing wavefront means that the
mutator cannot create new work for the collector by modifying the heap. Once an
object is marked, it'll stay marked for that GC cycle. It's also an <em>incremental update</em> collector, since
some objects that would have been live at the start of GC might get freed if they become free during the
collection cycle.</p>

<p>FUGC relies on <em>safepoints</em>, which comprise:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Pollchecks</em> emitted by the compiler. The <code>llvm::FilPizlonator</code> compiler pass emits pollchecks often enough that only a
bounded amount of progress is possible before a pollcheck happens. The fast path of a pollcheck is
just a load-and-branch. The slow path runs a <em>pollcheck callback</em>, which does work for FUGC.</p></li>
<li><p>Soft handshakes, which request that a pollcheck callback is run on all threads and then waits for
this to happen.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Enter</em>/<em>exit</em> functionality. This is for allowing threads to block in syscalls or long-running
runtime functions without executing pollchecks. Threads that are in the <em>exited</em> state will have
pollcheck callbacks executed by the collector itself (when it does the soft handshake). The only
way for a Fil-C program to block is either by looping while entered (which means executing a
pollcheck at least once per loop iteration, often more) or by calling into the runtime and then
exiting.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Safepointing is essential for supporting threading (Fil-C supports pthreads just fine) while avoiding
a large class of race conditions. For example, safepointing means that it's safe to load a pointer from
the heap and then use it; the GC cannot possibly delete that memory until the next pollcheck or exit.
So, the compiler and runtime just have to ensure that the pointer becomes tracked for stack scanning at
some point between when it's loaded and when the next pollcheck/exit happens, and only if the pointer is
still live at that point.</p>

<p>The safepointing functionality also supports <em>stop-the-world</em>, which is currently used to implement
<code>fork(2)</code> and for debugging FUGC (if you set the <code>FUGC_STW</code> environment variable to <code>1</code> then the
collector will stop the world and this is useful for triaging GC bugs; if the bug reproduces in STW
then it means it's not due to issues with the store barrier). The safepoint infrastructure also allows
safe signal delivery; Fil-C makes it possible to use signal handling in a practical way. Safepointing is
a common feature of virtual machines that support multiple threads and accurate garbage collection,
though usually, they are only used to stop the world rather than to request asynchronous activity from all
threads. See <a href="https://foojay.io/today/the-inner-workings-of-safepoints/">here</a> for a write-up about
how OpenJDK does it. The Fil-C implementation is in <a href="https://github.com/pizlonator/fil-c/blob/deluge/libpas/src/libpas/filc_runtime.c"><code>filc_runtime.c</code></a>.</p>

<p>Here's the basic flow of the FUGC collector loop:</p>

<ol>
<li>Wait for the GC trigger.</li>
<li>Turn on the store barrier, then soft handshake with a no-op callback.</li>
<li>Turn on black allocation (new objects get allocated marked), then soft handshake with a callback
that resets thread-local caches.</li>
<li>Mark global roots.</li>
<li>Soft handshake with a callback that requests stack scan and another reset of thread-local caches.
If all collector mark stacks are empty after this, go to step 7.</li>
<li>Tracing: for each object in the mark stack, mark its outgoing references (which may grow the mark
stack). Do this until the mark stack is empty. Then go to step 5.</li>
<li>Turn off the store barrier and prepare for sweeping, then soft handshake to reset thread-local
caches again.</li>
<li>Perform the sweep. During the sweep, objects are allocated black if they happen to be allocated out
of not-yet-swept pages, or white if they are allocated out of alraedy-swept pages.</li>
<li>Victory! Go back to step 1.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you're familiar with the literature, FUGC is sort of like the DLG (Doligez-Leroy-Gonthier) collector
(published in <a href="https://xavierleroy.org/publi/concurrent-gc.pdf">two</a>
<a href="http://moscova.inria.fr/~doligez/publications/doligez-gonthier-popl-1994.pdf">papers</a> because they
had a serious bug in the first one), except it uses the Dijkstra barrier and a grey stack, which
simplifies everything but isn't as academically pure (FUGC fixpoints, theirs doesn't). I first came
up with the grey-stack Dijkstra approach when working on
<a href="http://www.filpizlo.com/papers/pizlo-eurosys2010-fijivm.pdf">Fiji VM</a>'s CMR and
<a href="http://www.filpizlo.com/papers/pizlo-pldi2010-schism.pdf">Schism</a> garbage collectors. The main
advantage of FUGC over DLG is that it has a simpler (cheaper) store barrier and it's a slightly more
intuitive algorithm. While the fixpoint seems like a disadvantage, in practice it converges after a few
iterations.</p>

<p>Additionally, FUGC relies on a sweeping algorithm based on bitvector SIMD. This makes sweeping insanely
fast compared to marking. This is made thanks to the
<a href="https://github.com/pizlonator/fil-c/blob/deluge/libpas/src/libpas/verse_heap.h">Verse heap config</a>
that I added to
<a href="https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/blob/main/Source/bmalloc/libpas/Documentation.md">libpas</a>. FUGC
typically spends &lt;5% of its time sweeping.</p>

<h2>Bonus Features</h2>

<p>FUGC supports a most of C-style, Java-style, and JavaScript-style memory management. Let's break down what that means.</p>

<h3>Freeing Objects</h3>

<p>If you call <code>free</code>, the runtime will flag the object as free and all subsequent accesses to the object will trap. Additionally, FUGC will not scan outgoing references from the object (since they cannot be accessed anymore).</p>

<p>Also, FUGC will redirect all capability pointers (<em>lower</em>s in <a href="https://fil-c.org/invisicaps.html">InvisiCaps</a> jargon) to free objects to point at the free singleton object instead. This allows freed object memory to really be reclaimed.</p>

<p>This means that freeing objects can be used to prevent <em>GC-induced leaks</em>. Surprisingly, a program that works fine with <code>malloc</code>/<code>free</code> (no leaks, no crashes) that gets converted to GC the naive way (<code>malloc</code> allocates from the GC and <code>free</code> is a no-op) may end up leaking due to dangling pointers that the program never accesses. Those dangling pointers will be treated as live by the GC. In FUGC, if you freed those pointers, then FUGC will really kill them.</p>

<h3>Finalizers</h3>

<p>FUGC supports finalizer queues using the <code>zgc_finq</code> API in <a href="https://github.com/pizlonator/fil-c/blob/deluge/filc/include/stdfil.h">stdfil.h</a>. This feature allows you to implement finalizers in the style of Java, except that you get to set up your own finalizer queues and choose which thread processes them.</p>

<h3>Weak References</h3>

<p>FUGC supports weak references using the <code>zweak</code> API in <a href="https://github.com/pizlonator/fil-c/blob/deluge/filc/include/stdfil.h">stdfil.h</a>. Weak references work just like the weak references in Java, except there are no reference queues. Fil-C does not support phantom or soft references.</p>

<h3>Weak Maps</h3>

<p>FUGC supports weak maps using the <code>zweak_map</code> API in <a href="https://github.com/pizlonator/fil-c/blob/deluge/filc/include/stdfil.h">stdfil.h</a>. This API works almost exactly like the JavaScript <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap">WeakMap</a>, except that Fil-C's weak maps allow you to iterate all of their elements and get a count of elements.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>FUGC allows Fil-C to give the strongest possible guarantees on misuse of <code>free</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Freeing an object and then accessing it is guaranteed to result in a trap. Unlike tag-based approaches, which will trap on use after free until until memory reclamation is forced, FUGC means you will trap even after memory is reclaimed (due to <em>lower</em> repointing to the free singleton).</p></li>
<li><p>Freeing an object twice is guaranteed to result in a trap.</p></li>
<li><p>Failing to free an object means the object gets reclaimed for you.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We have something that sorts of work, at the cost of a steady 400% CPU usage, and that's not counting iTerm2 which uses ~200%. We've got a few problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need too much resources to render at 5 FPS</li>
<li>We render every time, even when nothing changes</li>
<li>We print all characters even if they didn't change on an individual level</li>
</ul>
<p>Modern browsers employ a multi-process architecture to improve security. It separates websites into different processes, reducing the potential damage caused by vulnerabilities. The renderer process is running in an OS-level sandboxed environment that blocks certain system calls, such as file-system access. The GPU process, is also considered unprivileged and cannot reach renderer process in order to protect against vulnerabilities in GPU APIs such as WebGL. In contrast, the browser process, considered privileged, can communicate freely with any process.</p>

<p>Now, we need to get our text data without any expensive round-trip. Blink has a <code>GetPaintRecord()</code> method to get the latest paint data for a page, but it's not behind a public API, which we need because our code runs in the content renderer. Ideally we should hook into the compositor (<code>cc</code>), but it's way more involved. It's dirty but we can workaround this by casting to the private <code>blink::WebViewImpl</code>:</p>

<p>Surprise after the first run: the text content doesn't follow the bitmap. Aaah, scrolling and animating is done on the compositor thread, which frees the main thread and makes everything smoother. Let's procastinate doing things right by adding <code>--disable-threaded-scrolling</code> <code>--disable-threaded-animation</code> to the command line arguments.</p>

<p>Pretty smooth, it'll be even smoother when threaded compositing is fixed! And we've fixed our biggest problem: we don't use any CPU when idling, and scrolling consumes ~15%.</p>

<p>For years, I relied on Spotify like millions of others. The convenience was undeniable stream anything, anywhere, discover new music through algorithms, and share playlists with friends. But over time, several issues became impossible to ignore: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Spotify#Allegations_of_unfair_artist_compensation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">artists getting paid fractions of pennies per stream</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy_over_fake_artists_on_Spotify" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fake Artists and ghost Tracks</a>, <a href="https://www.musicradar.com/music-tech/recording/ill-never-be-able-to-sing-that-perfectly-in-tune-but-i-dont-want-to-im-human-meet-the-real-artists-that-are-victims-of-ai-fake-tracks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI music and impersonation</a>, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/spotify/spotify-introduces-face-scanning-age-checks-for-uk-uses-as-some-furious-fans-threaten-to-return-to-piracy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creepy age verification complicity</a> and the fact that despite paying monthly, I never actually owned anything.
So I decided to take back control of my music experience. Here's how I built my own self-hosted music streaming setup that gives me everything Spotify offered and more.</p>

Yes, people <em>could</em> point it at less-than-legal sources. No, I'm not telling you to do that.
If you want to support artists, buy their work. If you don't, don't pretend Spotify streams are "support."</p></div>
<p><strong>Important Note</strong>: Always ensure you're obtaining music through legal channels such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital purchases (Bandcamp, iTunes, Amazon, etc.)</li>
<li>Ripping CDs you've purchased</li>
<li>Free legal downloads offered by artists</li>
<li>Music available under Creative Commons licenses</li>
</ul>
<p>My setup uses <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/sabnzbd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sabnzbd</a> integrated with Lidarr for handling downloads of content I've purchased. Both services run in Docker containers and are NOT exposed to the internet for security.</p>

<p>Since lrcget is GUI-only (no CLI version yet), I'm using a containerized version of it via <a href="https://www.kasmweb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kasm</a> and access it through my browser. It's a bit resource-intensive, so I only run it when adding new music or updating lyrics.</p>
<p>I've opened a <a href="https://github.com/tranxuanthang/lrcget/discussions/245" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">feature request</a> for a CLI version, which would make this process more automation-friendly.</p>

For this, I use <a href="https://github.com/TheWicklowWolf/Lidify" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lidify</a>, which connects to my Lidarr library and Last.fm account to generate recommendations.</p>
<p>I've also connected my Last.fm scrobbles to <a href="https://listenbrainz.org/user/leshicodes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ListenBrainz</a>, which promises to build weekly discovery playlists similar to Spotify's in the future.</p>
<h2 id="the-results">The Results<a href="#the-results" aria-label="Direct link to The Results" title="Direct link to The Results">​</a></h2>
<p>After several months with this setup, I'm extremely satisfied with the results:</p>

<table><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Spotify</th><th>My Self-Hosted Stack</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Music Quality</td><td>Up to 320kbps</td><td>Unlimited (FLAC/lossless)</td></tr><tr><td>Monthly Cost</td><td>$9.99-$14.99</td><td>One-time server setup + storage</td></tr><tr><td>Artist Payment</td><td>~$0.003-0.005 per stream</td><td>Direct support via purchases</td></tr><tr><td>Music Ownership</td><td>Rental only</td><td>Full ownership forever</td></tr><tr><td>Offline Access</td><td>Limited downloads</td><td>Complete library available</td></tr><tr><td>Privacy</td><td>Data collection &amp; tracking</td><td>Complete privacy</td></tr><tr><td>Content Permanence</td><td>Can disappear anytime</td><td>Never removed unless I choose</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The initial setup took a weekend, but maintenance is minimal. When I want new music, Lidarr handles it automatically. If I need to manually add something, I just drop the files in the right folder and Navidrome indexes them immediately.</p>
<p>Is it for everyone? No. But if you care about music, value ownership, and have basic technical skills, building your own music streaming solution is both achievable and rewarding. The freedom from corporate streaming platforms is worth the effort.</p>
<h2 id="supporting-artists">Supporting Artists<a href="#supporting-artists" aria-label="Direct link to Supporting Artists" title="Direct link to Supporting Artists">​</a></h2>
<p>Moving away from Spotify doesn't mean abandoning artists. In fact, I now support musicians more directly by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchasing music directly from platforms like Bandcamp where artists receive 82-90% of sales</li>
<li>Buying physical media from official stores</li>
<li>Supporting Patreon/subscription services for favorite artists</li>
<li>Attending concerts and buying merchandise</li>
</ul>
<p>Buying a $10 album on Bandcamp puts about $8.20-$9.00 in the artist's pocket. To match that on Spotify, you're talking roughly 1.6k-3k streams of that album <strong>per listener</strong>. If the artist has a label taking a cut on Spotify, the stream counts needed go up further.</p>
<p>My self-hosted setup is about controlling my listening experience and owning what I pay for, not avoiding fair compensation to artists.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What's Next?<a href="#whats-next" aria-label="Direct link to What's Next?" title="Direct link to What's Next?">​</a></h2>
<p>I'm continually refining this setup. Future improvements include automating the lyrics process and exploring more discovery tools. The beauty of a self-hosted solution is that it can evolve with my needs, rather than changing at the whim of a company's business model.</p></div></div>]]></description>
