<div id="article-body">
<p>In a move that will likely surprise no one, it appears Microsoft is gearing up to shut down Skype in the coming months. Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-killing-skype/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-killing-skype/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><em>XDA Developers</em></a>, the latest Skype for Windows preview reportedly includes a hidden string that reads <em><strong>"Starting in May, Skype will no longer be available. Continue your calls and chats in Teams." </strong></em>No other details are provided, but it certainly sounds like Skype's days are numbered.</p><p>Skype first launched in 2003 and was a very popular VOIP messaging platform in its heyday. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-close-buying-skype-7-billion-updated-its-official" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-close-buying-skype-7-billion-updated-its-official">Microsoft would later acquire Skype in 2011 for $8.5 billion</a>, and in the years since has attempted to integrate it across many products, including Windows, Windows Phone, and even Xbox.</p><p>The company has updated and redesigned Skype a number of times in the last decade, including splitting the app up in an attempt to integrate the service into Windows 10 Mobile's Phone and Messaging apps to position it as a viable iMessage competitor.</p><p>in the last handful of years, Skype has been seriously neglected. Microsoft failed to position Skype as a viable option during the pandemic, and the service has largely fallen by the wayside in the eyes of consumers. Most people have moved to more modern platforms such as Telegram, WhatsApp, iMessage, and Discord.</p><p>Microsoft did use Skype as a backbone to build out its popular Teams service for enterprise customers, but the experiences between the Teams and Skype apps are very different. Interestingly, it looks like Microsoft will encourage the remaining Skype users to switch to Teams, though this is likely referring to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-teams-consumer-announcement" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-teams-consumer-announcement">Teams for Consumers.</a></p><p>Skype in its current form is a sorry excuse for a messaging platform. It's a web-based app on Windows, which is very slow and does a terrible job at syncing conversations and notifications across devices. The app also doesn't even support Windows on Arm, which is something Microsoft has been pushing to adopt over the last half a decade.</p><p>In the last few years, Microsoft has tried to revive Skype with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/skype-text-messages-can-now-show-short-movie-and-tv-show-based-mojis-clips" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/skype-text-messages-can-now-show-short-movie-and-tv-show-based-mojis-clips">experiments such as Skype Clips</a>, which let users send short video messages to each other without calling them. In 2024, it also gained access to Copilot, self messaging, and a revamped mobile experience designed to compete with rival platforms.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-qbDJD7W5VwBdPpCoqrqAfE"><section><p>All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.</p></section></div><p>Nothing seems to have worked, as the service still hasn't seemed to have gained much traction. The last time Skype received a notable update was in May 2024. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/skype-credit-no-longer-available-for-purchase-moving-millions-toward-subscriptions-as-their-only-option" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/skype-credit-no-longer-available-for-purchase-moving-millions-toward-subscriptions-as-their-only-option">Microsoft recently shuttered its Skype Number service</a>, which let you buy a real phone number that could be used to call other phone numbers not on the Skype service.</p><p>So, it seems Skype's days are numbered. Microsoft is yet to officially confirm that Skype is being shut down, but we'll be sure to update this article when the official announcement arrives. We've reached out to Microsoft for comment and will update accordingly.</p>

<p>If you use the uBlock Origin extension in Google Chrome or Edge, you should probably start looking for alternative browsers or extensions—either way. A few days ago, users noticed that Google had begun disabling uBlock Origin and other Manifest V2-based extensions as part of the migration to Manifest V3. Now, Microsoft Edge <em>appears</em> to be following suit.</p>

<p>The latest Edge Canary version started disabling Manifest V2-based extensions with the following message: "This extension is no longer supported. Microsoft Edge recommends that you remove it." Although the browser turns off old extensions without asking, you can still make them work by clicking "Manage extension" and toggling it back (you will have to acknowledge another prompt).</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2025/02/1740579546_ublock_origin_dead.jpg"><img alt="uBlock Origin was turned off message in Edge" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2025/02/1740579546_ublock_origin_dead.jpg"></a></figure>                            <!-- PLACE THIS SECTION INSIDE OF YOUR BODY WHERE YOU WANT THE VIDEO PLAYER TO RENDER -->
            <p>At this point, it is not entirely clear what is going on. <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/google-to-begin-phasing-out-manifest-v2-extensions-in-chrome-on-june-3/">Google started phasing out Manifest V2 extensions</a> in June 2024, and it has a clear roadmap for the process. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions-chromium/developer-guide/manifest-v3">Microsoft's documentation</a>, however, still says "TBD," so the exact dates are not known yet. This leads to some speculating about the situation being one of "unexpected changes" coming from Chromium. Either way, sooner or later, Microsoft will ditch MV2-based extensions, so get ready as we wait for Microsoft to shine some light on its plans.</p>

<div data-oembed-url="https://x.com/Leopeva64/status/1894035389033103765">
<blockquote data-dnt="true">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">1/2 A message stating that some extensions have been disabled because they are no longer supported has appeared after installing the latest Edge Canary build, but I THINK this is one of those unexpected changes coming from upstream Chromium:<a href="https://t.co/NME5AvLUvg">https://t.co/NME5AvLUvg</a> <a href="https://t.co/BLWPI5onYh">pic.twitter.com/BLWPI5onYh</a></p>

</blockquote>

</div>

<p>Another thing worth noting is that the change does not appear to be affecting Edge's stable release or Beta/Dev Channels. For now, only Canary versions disable uBlock Origin and other MV2 extensions, leaving users a way to toggle them back on. Also, the uBlock Origin is <a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/ublock-origin/odfafepnkmbhccpbejgmiehpchacaeak">still available</a> in the Edge Add-ons store, <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-rolls-out-revamped-edge-add-ons-website/">which recently received a big update</a>.</p>

<p>In August 2024, when Google started flagging uBlock Origin as unsupported, the extension's maker stepped in and <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/ublock-origin-developer-recommends-switching-to-ublock-lite-as-chrome-flags-the-extension/">recommended users switch to uBlock Origin Lite</a>, a Manifest V3-based extension, and accept some of its limitations. Another option is to switch to Firefox. Mozilla recently <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-manifest-v3-adblockers/">announced</a> its plans to keep Manifest V2 extensions working, including uBlock Origin, based on Mozilla Manifesto, which claims that "individuals must have the ability to shape the internet and their own experiences on it."</p>

<p>Now, users can either switch to a browser that still supports MV2 extensions or move to MV3-based ad blockers. Of course, not all MV2 extensions have "more modern" versions, so for many, switching to Firefox or another browser with MV2 support will be the only option to keep old extensions working.</p>

<p>Imagine a government that knows what you do each day — the people you talk to, the news you read, the places you go. You might think of North Korea or a similar totalitarian regime.</p>



<p>But the US government also has access to such a chillingly clear picture of your life, even without the apparatus of a surveillance state. All it needs to do is ask Big Tech.</p>



<p>And because giants like Meta, Google, and Apple must collect as much of your personal data as possible, there’s little they can do to protect your privacy.</p>

<p>US law enforcement has been increasingly quick to enlist Big Tech’s help in recent years. From late 2014 to early 2024, the number of accounts shared by Google jumped 530%; at Meta (formerly Facebook), it surged 675%; and at Apple, it climbed 621% (fed by an outlier second half of 2022, when they shared over 300,000 accounts). </p>

<p>Collectively, <strong>these three companies handed over the details of 3.16 million accounts in just under a decade</strong>. This number doesn’t even include data requests made under the <a href="https://proton.me/blog/us-warrantless-surveillance#fisa-court">Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</a> (FISA), which are largely kept secret.</p>

<p>In the last six months of 2023 and the first six months of 2024 (the last 12 months there’s data for), the US government made nearly 500,000 data requests to Google and Meta — more than all the other members of the so-called 14 Eyes Alliance combined.</p>



<h2>Google, Meta and Apple form the world’s largest surveillance machine</h2>



<p>The US government has recognized three things about the tech giants:</p>



<ul>
<li>They all rely on tracking their users to generate revenue — and have become exceptionally good at it.</li>



<li>They are almost impossible to avoid if you spend any time online.</li>



<li>Most important, they cannot adopt encryption without undermining their business models.</li>
</ul>



<p>In 2024, a journalist for The Times of London <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/meta-user-data-collection-facebook-instagram-whatsapp-9klqhzlq9">requested her data from Meta<span>(new window)</span></a> to see exactly how much information it had on her. She got back 20,000 pages, including 20,000 interactions with websites and apps that weren’t even directly connected to her Meta accounts. Thanks to the Meta pixel and data-sharing agreements with banks, health apps, local governments, grocery stores, countless websites, and more, there was no window of her life Meta couldn’t see into — and rarely a day it didn’t receive her data.</p>



<p>This is just one service. <a href="https://proton.me/blog/apple-ad-company">Apple</a> and <a href="https://proton.me/blog/google-shows-more-ads">Google</a> hold similar amounts of data — if not more. These companies monitor your entire digital life, compiling a detailed profile that can be handed over at the government’s request or shared with a third party. Essentially, once one of these companies collects your information, you’ve completely lost control of who can see it.</p>



<p>Proponents argue that this is simply standard police work in the 21st century. Most data requests require a judge to approve a subpoena, and Big Tech companies can and do fight overly broad or unjustified requests when they can. However, even if you say that the 500,000 data requests made by the US government all followed due process, there are still hundreds of thousands of requests that were never reviewed by a judge that companies cannot fight at all.</p>



<h2>The US government can access this info with no oversight</h2>



<p>The FISA allows US intelligence agencies to request user data for national security purposes. These requests are issued with little oversight and cannot legally be refused. Some FISA requests, such as ones made using the <a href="https://proton.me/blog/us-warrantless-surveillance#section-702-loophole">Section 702</a> loophole, are never individually reviewed by a judge at all.</p>

<p>Since 2014, FISA content requests to Meta have increased 2,171%, while those to Google have risen 594%. Apple, though less transparent with its records, reported a 274% increase in such requests between 2018 and 2023.</p>



<h2>Big Tech is government’s partner<strong> </strong>in surveillance</h2>



<p>To be clear, we are not faulting Big Tech companies for complying with lawful, limited data requests. Every company must comply with the laws of the land that governs them. However, there are several issues at play. First, law enforcement agencies can use overly broad warrants to get access to reams of sensitive data. These “reverse warrants” (so named because law enforcement doesn’t need to specify a suspect), like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cnet.com/news/privacy/google-is-giving-data-to-police-based-on-search-keywords-court-docs-show/">geofencing<span>(new window)</span></a> or <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.cnet.com/news/privacy/google-is-giving-data-to-police-based-on-search-keywords-court-docs-show/">search term warrants<span>(new window)</span></a>, let law enforcement see anyone who was in a specific area or who searched for a specific term in a given time period. Investigations that rely on this data routinely end up falsely identifying suspects, with innocent people being charged with crimes, including <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/google-tracked-his-bike-ride-past-burglarized-home-made-him-n1151761">burglary<span>(new window)</span></a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/google-geofence-location-data-avondale-wrongful-arrest-molina-gaeta-11426374">murder<span>(new window)</span></a>. And certain FISA requests and <a href="https://proton.me/blog/us-warrantless-surveillance#national-security-letters">national security letters</a> let intelligence agencies or the FBI access data without any judicial oversight.</p>



<p>This brings us to the second problem. Big Tech companies know these abuses happen. Several of them even claim to care about your privacy. However, they cannot apply end-to-end encryption or even minimize user data collection without destroying their business models. In 2023, ads made up almost 98% of <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001326801/c7318154-f6ae-4866-89fa-f0c589f2ee3d.pdf">Meta’<span>(new window)</span></a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001326801/c7318154-f6ae-4866-89fa-f0c589f2ee3d.pdf">s revenue<span>(new window)</span></a> and 77% of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://abc.xyz/assets/52/88/5de1d06943cebc569ee3aa3a6ded/goog023-alphabet-2023-annual-report-web-1.pdf">Alphabet<span>(new window)</span></a><a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001326801/c7318154-f6ae-4866-89fa-f0c589f2ee3d.pdf">’<span>(new window)</span></a>s (specifically Google Ads). While Apple’s ad revenue is relatively small, it’s already <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-advertising-google-search-services-filings-2024-5">larger than Snap or X’s ad revenue<span>(new window)</span></a>, and growing fast. To protect their users’ privacy, these companies would have to fundamentally change how they make money, which is not something they have ever shown any appetite for.</p>



<p>Until this happens, they’ll continue monitoring you, collecting tens of thousands of pages of your information each year. And governments will continue to help themselves to this information.</p>



<h2>Want to take control of your privacy?</h2>



<p>As ubiquitous as Big Tech is, there is another way. Proton is based in <a href="https://proton.me/blog/switzerland">Switzerland</a>, a country with strict privacy laws. We cannot act on a data request unless it has been approved by the Swiss authorities. Moreover, Proton’s <a href="https://proton.me/blog/what-is-end-to-end-encryption">end-to-end encryption</a> ensures that even if we receive a valid request, we cannot access the content of your messages, files, or other sensitive information.</p>



<p>Our mission is to build a better internet where privacy is the default. We require minimal data to set up an account and offer anonymous payment options. Transparency is key to our approach — we make all our apps <a href="https://proton.me/community/open-source">open source</a>, share who makes up our team, and publish all government data requests in our <a href="https://proton.me/legal/transparency">Transparency Report</a> (we update this annually in March).</p>



<p>Proton provides a safer alternative, ensuring that your data is protected by design. At a time when marginalized groups and individuals face increasing threats, choosing privacy-focused services has never been more important.</p>

<p dir="auto">The Fire-Flyer File System (3FS) is a high-performance distributed file system designed to address the challenges of AI training and inference workloads. It leverages modern SSDs and RDMA networks to provide a shared storage layer that simplifies development of distributed applications. Key features and benefits of 3FS include:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Performance and Usability</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Disaggregated Architecture</strong> Combines the throughput of thousands of SSDs and the network bandwidth of hundreds of storage nodes, enabling applications to access storage resource in a locality-oblivious manner.</li>
<li><strong>Strong Consistency</strong> Implements Chain Replication with Apportioned Queries (CRAQ) for strong consistency, making application code simple and easy to reason about.</li>
<li><strong>File Interfaces</strong> Develops stateless metadata services backed by a transactional key-value store (e.g., FoundationDB). The file interface is well known and used everywhere. There is no need to learn a new storage API.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Diverse Workloads</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Data Preparation</strong> Organizes outputs of data analytics pipelines into hierarchical directory structures and manages large volume of intermediate outputs efficiently.</li>
<li><strong>Dataloaders</strong> Eliminates the need for prefetching or shuffling datasets by enabling random access to training samples across compute nodes.</li>
<li><strong>Checkpointing</strong> Supports high-throughput parallel checkpointing for large-scale training.</li>
<li><strong>KVCache for Inference</strong> Provides a cost-effective alternative to DRAM-based caching, offering high throughput and significantly larger capacity.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">The following figure demonstrates the throughput of read stress test on a large 3FS cluster. This cluster consists of 180 storage nodes, each equipped with 2×200Gbps InfiniBand NICs and sixteen 14TiB NVMe SSDs. Approximately 500+ client nodes were used for the read stress test, with each client node configured with 1x200Gbps InfiniBand NIC. The final aggregate read throughput reached approximately 6.6 TiB/s with background traffic from training jobs.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">2. GraySort</h3><a id="user-content-2-graysort" aria-label="Permalink: 2. GraySort" href="#2-graysort"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We evaluated <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/smallpond">smallpond</a> using the GraySort benchmark, which measures sort performance on large-scale datasets. Our implementation adopts a two-phase approach: (1) partitioning data via shuffle using the prefix bits of keys, and (2) in-partition sorting. Both phases read/write data from/to 3FS.</p>
<p dir="auto">The test cluster comprised 25 storage nodes (2 NUMA domains/node, 1 storage service/NUMA, 2×400Gbps NICs/node) and 50 compute nodes (2 NUMA domains, 192 physical cores, 2.2 TiB RAM, and 1×200 Gbps NIC/node). Sorting 110.5 TiB of data across 8,192 partitions completed in 30 minutes and 14 seconds, achieving an average throughput of <em>3.66 TiB/min</em>.</p>

<p dir="auto">KVCache is a technique used to optimize the LLM inference process. It avoids redundant computations by caching the key and value vectors of previous tokens in the decoder layers.
The top figure demonstrates the read throughput of all KVCache clients, highlighting both peak and average values, with peak throughput reaching up to 40 GiB/s. The bottom figure presents the IOPS of remove ops from garbage collection (GC) during the same time period.</p>

<div>
<h2 data-group="eu-sideloading" id="wait-i-thought-the-eu-mandated-that"><a href="#wait-i-thought-the-eu-mandated-that"><span>😮 Wait, I thought the EU mandated that?</span></a></h2><p>The <span><a href="https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/index_en">Digital Markets Act</a><i></i></span> is a recent EU antitrust law with the stated goal of making digital markets "fairer and more contestable". <span><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2022.265.01.0001.01.ENG&amp;toc=OJ%3AL%3A2022%3A265%3ATOC#art_6">Article 6(4)</a><i></i></span> reads as follows:</p><div><blockquote>



<p><i>The gatekeeper shall allow and technically enable the installation and effective use of third-party software applications or software application stores using, or interoperating with, its operating system and allow those software applications or software application stores to be accessed by means other than the relevant core platform services of that gatekeeper. The gatekeeper shall, where applicable, not prevent the downloaded third-party software applications or software application stores from prompting end users to decide whether they want to set that downloaded software application or software application store as their default. The gatekeeper shall technically enable end users who decide to set that downloaded software application or software application store as their default to carry out that change easily.</i></p><p><i>The gatekeeper shall not be prevented from taking, to the extent that they are strictly necessary and proportionate, measures to ensure that third-party software applications or software application stores do not endanger the integrity of the hardware or operating system provided by the gatekeeper, provided that such measures are duly justified by the gatekeeper.</i></p><p><i>Furthermore, the gatekeeper shall not be prevented from applying, to the extent that they are strictly necessary and proportionate, measures and settings other than default settings, enabling end users to effectively protect security in relation to third-party software applications or software application stores, provided that such measures and settings other than default settings are duly justified by the gatekeeper.</i></p></blockquote>
</div><p>Since Apple was designated as a gatekeeper under the DMA, and its mobile operating systems iOS and iPadOS were designated as core platform services, Apple is obligated to comply with the above rules. As a consequence, support for third party app stores in the EU was introduced with iOS 17.4 in March 2024.</p><p><strong>Unfortunately, the terms of Apple's compliance leave much to be desired, and "sideloading", as per the <a href="#what-would-it-mean-for-ios-to-have-sideloading">conventional definition</a>, is still not available on iOS:</strong></p><ul>
<li>All apps and app updates distributed outside the App Store still must be manually reviewed by employees at Apple, approved, and "notarized", else iOS will reject their installation. The criteria Apple uses to determine whether or not to approve the app is a <a href="#macos-vs.-ios-notarization-process">subset of the App Store guidelines</a> (with an emphasis on privacy and security).</li>
<li>Furthermore, on top of the $100/yr Apple Developer subscription required to submit apps for notarization, Apple also collects a significant <span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/core-technology-fee">"Core Technology Fee"</a><i></i></span> from developers distributing outside the App Store, easily totaling to a much higher percentage cut than the App Store's 30%, and possibly creating a net loss or even bankrupting the app developer, making alternative distribution an unattractive option in most cases. (Note that fee waivers are available for fully non-commercial apps.)</li>
</ul><p>The DMA also does not enable certain types of apps which are already available through <a href="#how-do-i-sideload-unofficially-on-ios">unofficial sideloading methods</a>:</p><ul>
<li>Apps that require JIT for performance, such as advanced emulators and virtual machine apps, with the exception of approved web browser apps (of which there are currently none) <a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref">[1]</a>
<ul>
<li><span><a href="https://getutm.app/">UTM</a><i></i></span> is an example of such an app.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Apps that use private APIs or OS frameworks in an "unintended" manner (as per <span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#software-requirements">notarization guideline 2.5.1</a><i></i></span>)
<ul>
<li>Riley Testut's clipboard manager app, "Clip", was <span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24100979/altstore-europe-app-marketplace-price-games#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20after%20I%20had%20tested%20Clip%2C%20Testut%20had%20to%20tweak%20the%20app%E2%80%99s">initially rejected</a><i></i></span> under this policy.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>Due to the aforementioned caveats, I will henceforth be referring to these apps as "alternative apps" rather than "sideloaded apps".</p><p>Apple believes that its notarization guidelines for alternative apps do not violate the DMA due to the exception provided in Article 6(4), which allows gatekeepers to take measures to ensure that alternative apps don't "endanger the integrity of the hardware or operating system", if said measures are "strictly necessary and proportionate".</p><p>Not everyone agrees with Apple's interpretation of the DMA, however. Epic Games has described Apple's changes as <span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050696/epic-games-tim-sweeney-apple-app-store-response">"malicious compliance"</a><i></i></span>. The Free Software Foundation Europe has released <span><a href="https://fsfe.org/news/2024/news-20240627-01.en.html">multiple statements</a><i></i></span> arguing that Apple's notarization process is not in compliance with the DMA, since (1) third party apps on iOS don't possess the capability to compromise the integrity of the OS and (2) on macOS, Apple's other computing platform, users can choose to install apps that aren't notarized by Apple (provided they accept the risks involved), yet macOS still manages to provide a relatively secure computing environment. It should also be noted that while users are highly encouraged to only run notarized apps on macOS, the notarization requirements for macOS are <a href="#macos-vs.-ios-notarization-process">much less stringent</a> and don't impede legitimate (non-malicious) developers in any meaningful way, unlike the iOS requirements.</p><p>As of the time of writing, the European Commission is still in the process of enforcing the DMA and interpreting compliance obligations. A <span><a href="https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/commission-sends-preliminary-findings-apple-and-opens-additional-non-compliance-investigation-2024-06-24_en">non-compliance investigation</a><i></i></span> against Apple was opened in June 2024 regarding "the contractual requirements imposed on alternative app developers" such as the Core Technology Fee, and another investigation regarding "the checks and reviews put in place by Apple to validate apps and alternative app stores to be sideloaded" may be opened soon.</p><p>To ensure compliance, Apple should follow in the footsteps of other digital gatekeepers and provide a means for advanced users who accept the risks to sideload freely. For examples of how Apple could do this without impacting non-technical users, see <a href="#do-other-devices-support-sideloading">here</a>.</p></div>
<div>
<h2 data-group="eu-sideloading" id="can-hobbyists-take-advantage-of-the-eus-dma-today"><a href="#can-hobbyists-take-advantage-of-the-eus-dma-today"><span>🧑‍💻 Can hobbyists take advantage of the EU's DMA today?</span></a></h2><p>While the DMA does not (as of the time of writing) enable true sideloading, it does theoretically enable opportunities for hobbyist developers to create apps that would have otherwise been rejected. It may also allow hobbyists with no intention of distributing to create personal apps for their own devices, provided they are willing to polish their apps to the extent that they meet Apple's notarization requirements. <strong>Remember, Apple will be reviewing the app under the impression that you are attempting to release it publicly to iOS users around the world, so the requirements are designed with that in mind.</strong></p><p>With that being said:</p><ul>
<li>Apple has waived the Core Technology Fee for non-commercial apps (though not for app stores <a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref">[2]</a>) that make no profit whatsoever, so the only fee you would pay is the $100 annual Apple Developer fee, which is required in order to submit apps for notarization.</li>
<li>Apple has waived the <span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#minimum-functionality">"minimal functionality"</a><i></i></span> portion of the App Store guidelines for alternative apps, which would otherwise forbid apps that aren't "particularly useful, unique, or app-like".</li>
<li><strong>Once an app is notarized, the signature does not appear to expire, and that specific build of the app can be installed and used indefinitely on any iOS device in the EU.</strong> You would however need to maintain your Apple Developer subscription and ensure ongoing compliance with the notarization guidelines in order to issue updates for your app.</li>
</ul><p>In general, it seems as though Apple may approve hobbyist apps even if they have no clear purpose for a general audience and are only intended to be used by the developer. The limits of what Apple is willing to approve for alternative distribution have yet to be tested. Unfortunately, due to <a href="#how-do-i-sideload-unofficially-on-ios">time-based expiry of all "development" certificates</a> (including paid ones), there is currently no better way to develop personal apps just for yourself, as the only (official) alternative is paying the $100 Apple Developer Program fee every year into the foreseeable future just to keep your app from expiring (even if you aren't actively updating it). It's truly a shame that Apple has created a unique situation where hobbyist developers have no better option than to pester Apple employees with pointless manual reviews just to create apps for their own personal use, which won't ever be installed on other user's devices.</p><div>
<h2>
⚠️
</h2>
<p>
If you're planning on publishing apps to the App Store in the future, please note that it's unclear if it's possible to switch back to the (arguably better) non-EU terms after you've already agreed to the EU terms.
</p>
</div><p><strong>You don't have to be located in the EU to submit apps for alternative distribution inside the EU.</strong> If you want to start experimenting with alternative apps right now despite the current limitations: AltStore PAL is an officially approved third party app store available for free, allowing the installation of notarized apps from any source. You may <span><a href="https://faq.altstore.io/developers/distribute-with-altstore-pal">review their documentation here</a><i></i></span>. You'll need an Apple Developer subscription, and you'll need to accept the alternative EU terms.</p></div>
<div>
<h2 data-group="eu-sideloading" id="can-users-outside-the-eu-access-alternative-apps"><a href="#can-users-outside-the-eu-access-alternative-apps"><span>🌎 Can users outside the EU access alternative apps?</span></a></h2><p>As a developer, you don't have to be in the EU to officially <a href="#can-hobbyists-take-advantage-of-the-eus-dma-today">submit apps for alternative distribution</a> inside the EU.</p><p>However, in order to actually install those apps, you need to be in the EU (or at least, your device needs to believe that you are). Apple utilizes hardware sensors to determine the user's geographical location in order to check eligibility for alternative apps and marketplaces as required in the EU, in addition to requiring an Apple ID registered in the EU.</p><p>It has been demonstrated to be possible to spoof some of these checks and access EU-exclusive features such as alternative apps outside the EU on iPhones and iPads. You may read my blog post about it <span><a href="https://downrightnifty.me/blog/2025/02/27/eu-features-outside.html">here</a><i></i></span>. (There are no guarantees that Apple won't make it more difficult to spoof these checks in the future, so you shouldn't rely on this.)</p><p>Once a device detects that it has left the EU, <strong>alternative apps that have already been installed will continue to work</strong>, but they will no longer receive updates after a 30-day grace period until the device moves back to the EU.</p><p>Something else that should be noted is that users from around the world can benefit from the competition that alternative app stores bring to Apple's store in general. In fact, this has already happened; Apple's <span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/5/24122341/apple-app-store-game-emulators-super-apps">unexpected reversal</a><i></i></span> of its long-standing policy against game console emulators was most likely a result of the Digital Markets Act, as it removes one of the primary incentives users would have otherwise had for installing Riley Testut's AltStore and his popular "Delta" emulator.</p></div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="what-is-sideloading"><a href="#what-is-sideloading"><span>📱 What is "sideloading"?</span></a></h2><p>Sideloading is simply the act of installing apps on your computing device that haven't been explicitly reviewed and approved by the company who made the device (or the operating system running on it). Traditionally this has just been called "installing software", because it used to be the standard method before the advent of centralized app stores.</p><p>It's unclear exactly when the term (as per the above definition) was first introduced into the general discourse. But according to Google data, it was most likely around 2009 at the earliest:</p><figure>
<img src="https://doesioshavesideloadingyet.com/assets/sideloading_google_trends.png" alt="Google Trends worldwide interest in &quot;sideloading&quot; from 2004-present">

</figure><p>(Not coincidentally, Apple launched the iPhone in 2007.)</p><p>It's quite unfortunate that a term with a negative connotation was coined to describe an inherently neutral activity. If I was being conspiratorial, I'd say it was all part of an elaborate profit-seeking plot by Apple to create <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubt">FUD</a><i></i></span> surrounding the topic. I'd tell you that "sideloading is the new <span><a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/1/15/7551873/jaywalking-history">jaywalking</a><i></i></span>".</p><p>But the truth is probably more nuanced than that. Malware used to be much more prevalent (and damaging) than it is today. It's getting harder and harder for attackers to convince people to execute malicious payloads on their devices, and the App Store most likely has something to do with that. Attackers have adapted to their new environment, and are largely migrating to other techniques that aren't so easily mitigated by software locks, such as phishing and cold call scamming. That being said, our computing devices are more secure than ever from the average user's perspective.</p><p>There's no denying that the model has begun to shift from users downloading or purchasing software directly from developers, to users downloading software from an "app store" middleman. Users delegate trust to the app store to vet the software they download to ensure it works properly, isn't malicious, and isn't accessing their data without their consent. For the average user, this creates a safer environment within which they can perform their computing tasks.</p><p>The App Store model clearly has real benefits for users. It would be dishonest to claim that protecting the end user's privacy and security is Apple's only motivation for pushing this model so heavily, though. There's of course enormous incentive created by the enormous profit generated through forcing everyone to use a centralized store. Apple's Services division, which includes the App Store, is their second largest, and has remained that way since Q3 2017. In Q4 2024, Apple made 26% of their revenue from Services. The Services division has been consistently creeping upwards over time, taking away from hardware's share year after year. <a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref">[3]</a></p><p>We should keep in mind that this didn't happen overnight. When the iPhone was released in June 2007, it didn't have an app store, and there was no (<span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_jailbreaking#JailbreakMe_and_AppSnapp">official</a><i></i></span>) method to install new apps. Steve Jobs described the new device "merely" as a "widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone, and a breakthrough Internet communicator" during his unforgettable 2007 WWDC presentation. The (technically arbitrary) software limitations imposed on Apple's new <span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220925123655/https://www.wired.com/2007/05/steve-jobs-ipho/">OSX-powered</a><i></i></span> portable-computer-but-not-advertised-as-such did not stand in the way of its success. People were so blown away by the iPhone, that any software shortcomings could easily be excused. The iPhone SDK was released in March 2008, alongside the announcement of the App Store, and it was confirmed that the App Store would be the exclusive method for distributing apps on the platform.</p><p>It's been 17 years since the release of the iPhone, and needless to say, smartphones and other mobile computing devices have changed the world. Smartphones are no longer a "nice to have", but rather an essential item we carry with us at all times, wherever we go. We <span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/aug/28/does-phone-separation-anxiety-really-exist">experience anxiety</a><i></i></span> when we realize we forgot to bring our smartphone with us.</p><p>Third party app support on iPhone, competition from Android, and <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_jailbreaking">talented hackers</a><i></i></span> allowed developers to begin pushing the limits of what these "phones" could do. Apple may not have realized it at the time, but it didn't just invent the modern smartphone in 2007; it invented the modern computer. iPhone OS became iOS, then iPadOS. Today, the iPad Pro is advertised as <span><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2017/11/16/ipad-pro-whats-a-computer-ad/">all but a computer</a><i></i></span>! The latest iPads even use the same processors as the latest Macs.</p><p>The iPhone paved the way for the app store model and other modern computer security features which are now considered baseline, such as full device encryption and verified/secure boot. With each new iOS security feature rolling out, Apple challenged the rest of the industry to improve their own security and privacy protections. All mainstream operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Chrome OS, and Android now implement an <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)">app sandbox</a><i></i></span> in some way (to varying degrees of success), something the iPhone did first.</p><p>If the entire industry is moving towards Apple's approach, then we should probably start thinking about what that means for the future of personal computing. To my knowledge, we've never seen a (conventional) "computer" that isn't user-programmable enter the mainstream market. We are now, though, seeing non-conventional computers which are many times more powerful than yesterday's conventional computers on paper, but are not user-programmable. We're becoming more tolerant of artificial limitations imposed by the operating systems we're forced to run on these devices, because we're told that it's the only way we can remain secure.</p><p>I think that, for the average user, these limitations are perfectly acceptable, and indeed preferable. But at the same time, I don't think we should leave powerusers and developers in the dust as we craft this new world of secure computing. Apple has made some brilliant, ultraportable, and remarkably powerful computing devices, but the OS that runs on them is preventing users from realizing their true potential, and it's kind of sad. Implementing advanced features such as sideloading in a way that prevents social engineering attacks convincing non-technical users to enable them is non-trivial, but <a href="#case-study-chromeos">definitely possible</a>, and absolutely vital if we are to avoid redefining the modern "computer" as something entirely different.</p></div>
<div>
<h2 id="what-are-benefits-of-sideloading"><a href="#what-are-benefits-of-sideloading"><span>💙 What are benefits of sideloading?</span></a></h2><p>Non-exhaustive list of sideloading use cases and benefits:</p><ul>
<li>Allows the end user to <span><a href="https://www.bennettnotes.com/notes/why-does-apple-restrict-hobby-development/">write apps for their own device</a><i></i></span>
<ul>
<li>In other words: it would enable the use of iOS devices as <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">general-purpose computers</a><i></i></span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Allows for perfectly legitimate apps that cannot be uploaded to the App Store due to its strict guidelines, creating a more fair, more free, and more open market for apps
<ul>
<li>Examples include:
<ul>
<li>Apps that require <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation">JIT compilation</a><i></i></span> to function, such as <span><a href="https://dolphinios.oatmealdome.me/">Dolphin</a><i></i></span>, a Wii emulator that runs beautifully on iOS using JIT</li>
<li>Apps that require JIT compilation for performance, such as <span><a href="https://getutm.app/">UTM</a><i></i></span>, which brings virtual machines to iOS</li>
<li>Alternative web browser engines such as Firefox (Gecko) and Chrome (Blink), which would bring competition to the space, benefiting all users</li>
<li>Alternative clients for popular services like YouTube
<ul>
<li>I wasn't able to find an example for iOS, but <span><a href="https://newpipe.net/">NewPipe</a><i></i></span> is my preferred YouTube client on Android, and <span><a href="https://grayjay.app/">Grayjay</a><i></i></span> is a promising new Android-exclusive app that combines different streaming services together</li>
<li>Despite being perfectly legal in most countries, these can't be uploaded to the App Store due to <span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#intellectual-property">guideline 5.2.2</a><i></i></span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Apps that use OS APIs in an "unintended" manner, such as <span><a href="https://rileytestut.com/blog/2020/06/17/introducing-clip/">Clip</a><i></i></span></li>
<li>Apps that execute code dynamically, such as <span><a href="https://ish.app/blog/ish-jit-and-eu">performant terminal emulators</a><i></i></span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>These classes of apps used to be entirely excluded from the App Store until Apple suddenly reversed course, most likely in response to legislation, antitrust investigations, or competition from third party app stores:
<ul>
<li><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/5/24122341/apple-app-store-game-emulators-super-apps">Game console emulators</a><i></i></span>, most likely to remove a primary incentive users would have otherwise had for installing Riley Testut's AltStore and his popular "Delta" emulator.</li>
<li>Cloud streaming services, most likely due to an <span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/21/24107633/apple-streaming-super-apps-doj-lawsuit">impending antitrust lawsuit</a><i></i></span>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Keep in mind, I could probably list even more examples if sideloading were officially supported and these apps didn't <a href="#how-do-i-sideload-unofficially-on-ios">require workarounds</a> such as jailbreaking to use! It's currently difficult to justify developing iOS apps that won't be accepted into the App Store, because very few users are going to be able to actually use them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Allows <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">free and open source software (FOSS)</a><i></i></span> to exist on iOS
<ul>
<li>Currently, FOSS is completely blocked by all iOS devices at the OS level! I personally believe in the value of FOSS, and I try to use as much of it as possible, but regardless of your feelings on it, it's difficult to argue that it should be completely blocked on one of the most popular computing platforms.

<li>Note that open source software is not the same as FOSS. Open source software is allowed on iOS, but FOSS is not. To quality as FOSS, a software product must provide all four essential freedoms to the end user. Since end users cannot freely make changes to their own copy of any iOS app, <em>even if the developers want to allow this</em>, all iOS apps automatically violate <span><a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html#four-freedoms">freedom #1 of the official Free Software Definition</a><i></i></span>, and as such they are not FOSS.</li>

</ul></div>
<div>
<h2 id="is-sideloading-safe"><a href="#is-sideloading-safe"><span>🔒 Is sideloading safe?</span></a></h2><p>Sideloading is generally safe if:</p><ul>
<li>You wrote the apps that you're sideloading yourself, or</li>
<li>You carefully vet the sources of apps that you sideload, and your operating system provides some level of protection against malicious apps
<ul>
<li>Android and iOS enforce a strict sandbox on all apps, which ensures that apps can only access sensitive data with explicit user consent. macOS is moving towards enforcing a sandbox on apps from all sources as well, but it isn't there quite yet, so sideloading is still fairly risky. Windows 10+ has a built-in antivirus, but that doesn't protect you against unknown threats. Windows 10+ also has <span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/msix-container">opt-in app sandbox</a><i></i></span>, and Windows 11 <span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/app-isolation-overview">improves the sandbox further</a><i></i></span>, but in practice sandboxing is rarely used. Be extra careful when sideloading on Windows.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>In fact, some of the most secure systems in the world, arguably more secure than iOS, <a href="#do-other-devices-support-sideloading">support sideloading</a>.</p><p>Even among those who sideload, most prefer to offload these trust decisions to a third party app store. This means you only have to make a relatively high-stakes trust decision for each app store you download, which only happens once or twice in most cases. On Android, most sideloaded apps are obtained through <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-Droid">F-Droid</a><i></i></span>, a trusted third party app store that only serves open source apps built using their own (also open source) infrastructure. On Windows, most sideloaded games are obtained through <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)">Steam</a><i></i></span>, a trusted third party app store that vets each game before making it available.</p><p>Ideally, third party app stores work with the underlying OS and provide the user with sufficient information about each app's author, what it does, and what sensitive data it may request access to, if any. For example, F-Droid provides a list of any Android permissions that an app may request on the app details page of every app in the store. F-Droid further provides a list of <span><a href="https://f-droid.org/docs/Anti-Features/">"anti-features"</a><i></i></span> for each app, warning users of potentially undesirable behavior such as advertising or exchanging data with proprietary network services. AltStore, an alternative app store for iOS, provides information about permissions that each app may request as well. Personally, I trust F-Droid more than the Play Store or App Store, and most of my favorite apps on my Android phone come from there.</p><figure>
<img src="https://doesioshavesideloadingyet.com/assets/altstore_and_f-droid_permissions.png" alt="Permission details on AltStore and F-Droid app listing pages">

</figure><p>iOS and Android follow a <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">principle of least privilege</a><i></i></span> approach for third party apps (and usually for system apps and background processes as well). They both enforce a strict sandbox on all third party apps, regardless of where the apps were obtained from. An Android app <span><a href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/overview/app-security#the-android-permission-model-accessing-protected-apis">does not have access to any sensitive data or resources by default</a><i></i></span>. iOS works similarly. Users must explicitly grant access to any sensitive data or resources. As such, you can be fairly confident that, even if you accidentally installed a malicious app, it isn't able to access any sensitive data that you didn't explicitly provide it. iOS and Android apps also aren't allowed to interfere with the operating system itself, so you can safely and easily uninstall a malicious app without worrying about any lingering effects afterwards. Somewhat ironically, despite iOS refusing to allow sideloading, it's actually among the safest operating systems to sideload on.</p><p>Sideloading may not be safe for users who are not technically literate or are generally gullible, because they may be tricked into installing a malicious app and then granting said app permission to access sensitive data or resources. (Note that browsing the web carries similar risks, so all users of computing devices would ideally receive some baseline internet safety training.)</p><p>This is often touted as a reason why iOS should not support sideloading at all, but I wholeheartedly disagree. Even if sideloading isn't made generally available to all users, it can still be made available to technically-inclined users only. This isn't a trivial task, and requires a bit of thought to implement correctly, but it's very much possible and has <a href="#case-study-chromeos">already been done before</a>.</p></div>

<h2 id="what-would-it-mean-for-ios-to-have-sideloading"><a href="#what-would-it-mean-for-ios-to-have-sideloading"><span>🤔 What would it mean for iOS to "have" sideloading?</span></a></h2><p>For the purposes of this website, an operating system supports sideloading if it provides some means for technically-inclined end users to permanently install native apps <a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref">[4]</a> without prior approval from any company or organization, either free of charge, or for a reasonable one-time fee.</p><p>An operating system does not need to endorse, recommend, or make it easy to sideload in order for it to support sideloading as an option. Operating systems that only allow advanced users to sideload through scare prompts, hidden "development" modes, or any other methods still count. Operating systems that require a one-time payment (within reason) to unlock sideloading, or which require you to accept some basic terms (within reason) before you enable sideloading would also count. Operating systems employing any combination of the described techniques, or any other techniques, to discourage sideloading for the average user, or to prevent social engineering attacks convincing users to enable sideloading, still count.</p><p>For example, <a href="#case-study-chromeos">we consider Chrome OS</a> to support sideloading.</p><p>Apple would not have to make sweeping changes to iOS in order to qualify; in fact, a minor policy change would be more than sufficient. For example, all it would take to qualify is for Apple to remove the unnecessary expiry dates from development certificates (which can only be used on the creator's own devices, and cannot be used for distribution). They currently expire after 7 days for free accounts, or 1 year for paid accounts.</p><p>There are several community-supported unofficial sideloading methods for iOS, but we don't consider those to count, because they aren't guaranteed to continue working through iOS security updates, they aren't authorized by Apple and may break Apple's end user license agreement, and they have significant downsides.</p></div>

<p>These operating systems are regarded by security experts as being extremely secure, and yet still support sideloading:</p><ul>
<li>ChromeOS</li>
<li><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GrapheneOS">GrapheneOS</a><i></i></span>, a security and privacy enhanced fork of Android</li>
</ul><h2 id="case-study-chromeos">Case study: ChromeOS</h2><p>ChromeOS is probably the most secure mainstream consumer operating system in the world. It implements a cryptographically verified boot chain which ensures that neither the OS nor any of its components has been tampered with, mandatory full device encryption, and strict sandboxing for all third party code with no exceptions, among many other <span><a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-library/reference/security/security-whitepaper/">advanced defense-in-depth security features</a><i></i></span>. All third party native code inside Android apps is isolated using virtualization, and on top of that, the standard Android app sandbox applies.</p><p>By default, apps can only be installed through the Google Play Store. To enable sideloading, you need to follow a complex series of steps, agree to some basic terms and conditions, factory reset your device, and enable <span><a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-library/guides/device/developer-mode/">"developer mode"</a><i></i></span>. In addition, every time you reboot the device after enabling developer mode, you'll be reminded by the boot screen that your security is reduced and you will need to confirm that this is acceptable before the OS loads.</p><figure>
<img src="https://doesioshavesideloadingyet.com/assets/chromeos_dev_mode.png" alt="ChromeOS developer mode boot warning (via Reddit)">

</figure><p>Google created this process to ensure that it's completely infeasible for an attacker to trick someone into enabling developer mode and compromising theirself, while at the same time enabling advanced users to make full use of the hardware they purchased.</p><p>I honestly believe that, for better or for worse, this "opt-in developer mode for advanced users only" is the only sustainable approach going forward. All computers are becoming easier to use and more secure than ever before, not just iOS devices, and I think that's a good thing overall, but I also think that there should always be an "escape hatch" for advanced users (and as of the time of writing, there always is, except on iOS).</p><h2 id="macos-vs.-ios-notarization-process">macOS vs. iOS notarization process</h2><p>Apple uses the term "notarization" to describe the approval process for apps submitted to third party app stores on iOS, which is confusing because it's they use the same term to describe a very different process on macOS.</p><p>On macOS, notarization is an automated review process that performs malware checks and basic security checks on any submitted software, in addition to requiring a verified identity as part of the Apple Developer program. Apple does not impose any guidelines, besides requiring that they are not malicious, on macOS apps submitted for notarization.</p><p>On iOS, notarization is a manual review process conducted similarly to the App Store review process. An Apple employee must manually review each app for violations of the iOS <span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/distributing-apps-in-the-european-union/submit-for-notarization/">notarization guidelines</a><i></i></span>, which are a subset of the App Store guidelines, before it can be distributed on so-called "alternative" app stores. The iOS notarization guidelines include <a href="#what-are-benefits-of-sideloading">unnecessary rules that impede legitimate apps</a>.</p><p>Another important difference between macOS and iOS notarization is that <strong>users can choose to run software that hasn't been notarized on macOS, if they accept the risks involved</strong>. Of course, Apple highly recommends that users only run software that has been notarized by Apple, and macOS blocks the installation of software that isn't notarized by default. But an option, buried deep within the Privacy &amp; Security settings, is provided, allowing advanced users to run the software of their choice.</p><figure>

You shouldn't rely on any of these methods to keep working indefinitely as Apple continually releases security updates for iOS.

</ul><p>Cons:</p><ul>
<li>Apps signed with free certificates are subject to limitations and can't access all capabilities</li>
<li>Doesn't always work reliably due to iOS background execution restrictions</li>
<li>Requires an ongoing Internet connection and a home server setup</li>
<li>Fundamentally reliant on Apple's signing service to work</li>
</ul><h2 id="jailbreaking">Jailbreaking</h2><p>Jailbreaking involves exploiting accidentally-introduced security vulnerabilities in iOS to gain more control over your device. Typically, jailbreaks enable sideloading, in addition to system-level tweaks and modifications.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul>

<li>Enables unrestricted sideloading</li>
</ul><p>Cons:</p><ul>
<li>Generally not supported on the latest iOS devices and versions, because it relies on Apple making big mistakes and these are usually quickly fixed with updates</li>
<li>Requires avoiding OS updates, opening you up to patched vulnerabilities, reducing your security, and preventing you from taking advantage of new features</li>

I currently use a Google Pixel (Android) phone, an iPad, and a MacBook Pro. I'll probably switch to iPhone if the answer to the question this site poses ever becomes "yes".</p><p>As part of a university project, I recently developed an iOS app that keeps track of your expenses and receipts. It's not polished enough to submit to the App Store, but it would have been quite useful to me personally.</p><p>I was using my app on my iPad when all of a sudden it was disabled:</p><figure>

</figure><p>I soon discovered that apps you install via Xcode <a href="#how-do-i-sideload-unofficially-on-ios">only last for seven days</a>. That didn't seem right to me. My team and I wrote the app from scratch, but it didn't really feel like "our" app, because we're not even allowed to use it on our own devices without asking Apple's cloud service for permission to do so every week into eternity. This was in stark contrast to my experience with my MacBook Pro, for which I've developed numerous utilities and apps for personal use by myself without any issue.</p><p>So, I started digging into the topic of sideloading on iOS.

      </p><p>Markov chains, named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Markov">Andrey Markov</a>, are mathematical systems that hop from one "state" (a situation or set of values) to another. For example, if you made a Markov chain model of a baby's behavior, you might include "playing," "eating", "sleeping," and "crying" as states, which together with other behaviors could form a 'state space': a list of all possible states. In addition, on top of the state space, a Markov chain tells you the probabilitiy of hopping, or "transitioning," from one state to any other state---e.g., the chance that a baby currently playing will fall asleep in the next five minutes without crying first.</p>
<p>A simple, two-state Markov chain is shown below.</p>

      </p><p>With two states (A and B) in our state space, there are 4 possible transitions (not 2, because a state can transition back into itself). If we're at 'A' we could transition to 'B' or stay at 'A'. If we're at 'B' we could transition to 'A' or stay at 'B'. In this two state diagram, the probability of transitioning from any state to any other state is 0.5.</p>
<p>Of course, real modelers don't always draw out Markov chain diagrams. Instead they use a "transition matrix" to tally the transition probabilities. Every state in the state space is included once as a row and again as a column, and each cell in the matrix tells you the probability of transitioning from its row's state to its column's state. So, in the matrix, the cells do the same job that the arrows do in the diagram.</p>

      </div><p>If the state space adds one state, we add one row and one column, adding one cell to every existing column and row. This means the number of cells grows quadratically as we add states to our Markov chain. Thus, a transition matrix comes in handy pretty quickly, unless you want to draw a jungle gym Markov chain diagram.</p>
<p>One use of Markov chains is to include real-world phenomena in computer simulations. For example, we might want to check how frequently a new dam will overflow, which depends on the number of rainy days in a row. To build this model, we start out with the following pattern of rainy (R) and sunny (S) days:</p>

      <p>One way to simulate this weather would be to just say "Half of the days are rainy. Therefore, every day in our simulation will have a fifty percent chance of rain." This rule would generate the following sequence in simulation:</p>

      <p>Did you notice how the above sequence doesn't look quite like the original? The second sequence seems to jump around, while the first one (the real data) seems to have a "stickyness". In the real data, if it's sunny (S) one day, then the next day is also much more likely to be sunny.</p>
<p>We can minic this "stickyness" with a two-state Markov chain. When the Markov chain is in state "R", it has a 0.9 probability of staying put and a 0.1 chance of leaving for the "S" state. Likewise, "S" state has 0.9 probability of staying put and a 0.1 chance of transitioning to the "R" state.</p>

      <p>In the hands of metereologists, ecologists, computer scientists, financial engineers and other people who need to model big phenomena, Markov chains can get to be quite large and powerful. For example, the algorithm Google uses to determine the order of search results, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a>, is a type of Markov chain.</p>


<p>Above, we've included a Markov chain "playground", where you can make your own Markov chains by messing around with a transition matrix. Here's a few to work from as an example: ex1, ex2, ex3 or generate one randomly. The transition matrix text will turn red if the provided matrix isn't a valid transition matrix. <em>The rows of the transition matrix must total to 1.</em> There also has to be the same number of rows as columns.</p>

<p>In a significant business development, Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim has decided to cancel his collaboration with Elon Musk’s Starlink. The decision comes after a series of tensions between the two magnates, culminating in Slim’s choice to invest in his own infrastructure rather than relying on Starlink’s satellite technology.</p>



<p>Slim’s company, América Móvil, announced plans to invest $22 billion over the next three years to enhance its telecommunications infrastructure. This move is seen as a strategic effort to strengthen its position in the market and reduce dependency on external partners like Starlink. The decision is expected to have a substantial financial impact on Musk’s company, which had anticipated a lucrative partnership in Latin America.</p>



<p>The fallout between Slim and Musk was further exacerbated by a controversial tweet from Musk, which implied connections between Slim and organized crime. This accusation, although unproven, added fuel to the already strained relationship between the two business tycoons.</p>



<p>By opting to develop its own infrastructure, América Móvil aims to maintain control over its operations and ensure the reliability of its services. This decision marks a significant shift in the dynamics of the telecommunications industry in Latin America, highlighting the competitive nature of the market and the strategic maneuvers of its key players.</p><div>

<p><a href="https://mexicodailypost.com/2025/01/23/elon-musk-accused-carlos-slim-of-alleged-ties-to-drug-trafficking/">Elon Musk shared a post on his social network stating that Slim could have ties to criminal groups</a>, and five minutes later, Carlos Slim canceled all business collaborations with Starlink in Latin America, which made Musk lose 7 billion US dollars.</p>



<p>An hour later, Slim announced that he would transfer his projects for the next 5 years with Starlink, an investment of 22 billion dollars, to companies in China and Europe.</p>



<p>More than money, Musk lost his main partner in 25 countries, in addition to giving up all that territory to companies of his competition and, most seriously, causing the USA to continue losing commercial presence and giving it to China.</p>

<p>HashiCorp's capabilities drive significant synergies across multiple strategic growth areas for IBM, including Red Hat, watsonx, data security, IT automation and Consulting</p>

</div><div wd_resize="formatNews" wd_print_url="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2025-02-27-ibm-completes-acquisition-of-hashicorp,-creates-comprehensive,-end-to-end-hybrid-cloud-platform?printable=1"><p>,  /<a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/" target="_blank">PRNewswire</a>/ --&nbsp;IBM (NYSE: <u><a href="http://www.ibm.com/investor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IBM</a></u>)&nbsp;today announced it has completed its acquisition of <u><a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">HashiCorp</a></u>, whose products automate and secure the infrastructure that underpins hybrid cloud applications and generative AI. Together the companies' capabilities will help clients accelerate innovation, strengthen security, and get more value from the cloud.</p>

<p><a href="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2629239/HashiCorp.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="HashiCorp, an IBM Company." src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2629239/HashiCorp.jpg" title="HashiCorp, an IBM Company."> </a></p>

<p>Today nearly 75% of enterprises are using hybrid cloud<sup>1</sup>, including public clouds from hyperscalers and on-prem data centers, which can enable true innovation with a consistent approach to delivering and managing that infrastructure at scale. Enterprises are looking for ways to more efficiently manage and modernize cloud infrastructure and security tasks from initial planning and design, to ongoing maintenance. By 2028, it is projected that generative AI will lead to the creation of 1 billion new cloud-native applications.<sup>2</sup> Supporting this scale requires infrastructure automation far beyond the capacity of the workforce alone.</p>

<p><i>"Organizations globally are looking to deploy modern, hybrid cloud-ready apps, which require automated cloud infrastructure at significant scale," <b>said <span>Rob Thomas</span>, Senior Vice President, IBM Software and Chief Commercial Officer.</b> "With this acquisition, IBM is committed to continuing to invest in and grow the HashiCorp capabilities,</i><i>&nbsp;and together, with HashiCorp's leading technology and extensive developer community, IBM's global reach and R&amp;D resources, our aim is to infuse HashiCorp technology in every data center."</i></p>

<p><i>"HashiCorp has been helping the world's largest enterprises succeed in hybrid and multi-cloud environments for over a decade. We've seen the cloud grow from its origins, and have participated first-hand in the change it has brought to the industry," <b>said <span>Dave McJannet</span>, CEO, HashiCorp.</b> "With IBM's history, </i><i>global </i><i>scale, and customer relationships, HashiCorp can now expand our reach to help our community of customers, practitioners, and partners automate, secure, and optimize their cloud infrastructure, providing an end-to-end platform for hybrid environments."</i></p>

<p><i>"HashiCorp has been a pioneer in cloud infrastructure since the earliest days of public cloud. We've built a portfolio of products to help customers embrace a cloud native approach to Infrastructure and Security Lifecycle Management that has been embraced by hundreds of thousands of organizations around the world," <b>said <span>Armon Dadgar</span>, CTO and Co-founder of HashiCorp.</b> "I'm excited for HashiCorp to join the IBM family, where there is clear alignment on the vision of enabling hybrid infrastructure for the world's biggest enterprises. Together, we can continue to invest deeply in R&amp;D innovation and enable the next generation of applications to be built and scaled."</i></p>

<p><b>Product detail and availability</b></p>

<ul type="disc">
	<li>HashiCorp's capabilities enable enterprises to use automation to deliver lifecycle management for infrastructure and security, providing a system of record for the critical workflows needed for hybrid and multi-cloud environments. HashiCorp Terraform is a leader for infrastructure provisioning in these environments. HashiCorp's offerings help clients take a highly interoperable approach to multi-cloud management, and complement IBM's commitment to industry collaboration (including deep and expanding partnerships with hyperscale cloud service providers), developer and open source communities for hybrid cloud and AI innovation.</li>
	<li>Its Terraform and Vault offerings, along with the broader HashiCorp product portfolio, are available now from IBM's automation software portfolio.</li>
	<li>HashiCorp will drive significant synergies for IBM, including across multiple strategic growth areas like Red Hat, watsonx, data security, IT automation and Consulting. For example, Terraform and the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform</a>&nbsp;provide a powerful combination, with Terraform automating the foundational infrastructure creation across multiple cloud providers, and Ansible automating application configurations and middleware deployments on top of that infrastructure.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>In addition, HashiCorp Vault combined with <u><a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Red Hat OpenShift</a></u> provide robust secrets management and security capabilities across hybrid cloud environments, and Terraform can enable the building and deployment of IBM Z applications in hybrid cloud environments.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>Builds on IBM's Portfolio of AI-driven IT Automation Capabilities</i></b></p>

<p>The HashiCorp acquisition continues IBM's broad investments in automation software to help organizations optimize their IT spending and lower costs. This includes AI-powered software for&nbsp; application management insights across clients' portfolios to identify, predict, and suggest fixes for problems; software for full IT stack observability and to optimize application performance at the lowest cost; application resource management tools that efficiently scale operations and reduce cloud expense; financial management solutions that drive real-time insight into IT spending decisions across the enterprise; and software to integrate thousands of applications and data across hybrid cloud environments.</p>

<p>The closing of IBM's&nbsp;acquisition of HashiCorp&nbsp;includes all of the issued and outstanding common shares of HashiCorp for <span>$35</span> per share in cash, representing an enterprise value of <span>$6.4 billion</span>.</p>

<p>The trial will be led by The Brain Cancer Centre, which has world-leading expertise in glioblastoma.</p>
<p>“I am delighted to be handing the baton to <a href="https://www.wehi.edu.au/researcher/jim-whittle/">Dr Jim Whittle</a>, a leading Australian neuro-oncologist at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, The Royal Melbourne Hospital and Co-Head of Research Strategy at The Brain Cancer Centre, to commence a broader scientific study to scientifically determine if – and how – this process might work in treating glioblastoma,” said Prof Long, who also secured drug access for the clinical trial.</p>
<p>“While we are buoyed by the results of this experimental treatment so far, a clinical trial in a large group of patients would need to happen before anyone could consider it a possible breakthrough.”</p>
<p>Dr Whittle, also a laboratory head at WEHI, said: “We are pleased to be able to build on this exciting work by diving into the process of designing a clinical trial, which takes time, care and accuracy.</p>
<p>“When that process is complete, the result will be a world first clinical trial that enables us to thoroughly test the hypothesis against a representative sample of patients.”</p>
<p>The Brain Cancer Centre was founded by Carrie’s Beanies 4 Brain Cancer and established in partnership with WEHI with support from the Victorian Government.</p>
<p>The centre brings together a growing network of world-leading oncologists, immunologists, neurosurgeons, bioinformaticians and cancer biologists.</p>
<p>Commencement of recruitment for the clinical trial will be announced by The Brain Cancer Centre at a later date and will be limited to eligible patients.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>If you’ve felt overwhelmed by all the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-autorif-mass-firing-government-workers/">DOGE</a> news, you’re not alone. You’d need too much cork board and yarn to keep track of which agencies it has occupied by now, much less what it’s doing there. Here’s a simple rubric, though, to help contextualize the DOGE updates you do have time and energy to process: It’s worse than you think.</p><p>DOGE is hard to keep track of. This is by design; the only information about the group outside of its own mistake-ridden ledger of “savings” comes from media reports. So much for being “maximally transparent,” as Elon Musk has promised. The blurriness is also partly a function of the speed and breadth with which DOGE has operated. Keeping track of the destruction is like counting individual bricks scattered around a demolition site.</p><p>You may be aware, for instance, that a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-young-engineers/">19-year-old who goes by “Big Balls” online</a> plays some role in all this. Seems bad. But you may have missed that Edward Coristine has since been installed at the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-cisa-coristine-cybersecurity/">nation’s top cybersecurity agency</a>. And the State Department and <a data-offer-url="https://x.com/HSBCDems/status/1886503237966024846" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/HSBCDems/status/1886503237966024846&quot;}" href="https://x.com/HSBCDems/status/1886503237966024846" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the Small Business Administration</a>. And he has a Department of Homeland Security email address and, by the way, also had a recent <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/edward-coristine-tesla-sexy-path-networks-doge/">side gig selling AI Discord bots to Russians</a>. See? Worse than you think.</p><p>Even if that feels like old news, remember that it’s actually still happening, every day a fresh incursion by Big Balls and his cohort of twentysomething technologists. (In fairness, they’re not all young; some of them are old enough to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/krause-doge-cloud-software-treasury/">present conflicts of interest so flagrant</a> that they literally lack modern precedent.)</p><p>Similarly, you’ve likely heard that the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-guts-usaid-workforce/">United States Agency for International Development has been gutted</a> and the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/dozens-of-cfpb-workers-terminated-in-after-hours-firing-blitz/">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has been put on ice</a>. All true, all bad. But here’s what that means in practice: Fewer people globally have access to vaccines than they did a month ago. More babies are being <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/usaid-researchers-email-access/">born with HIV/AIDS</a>. From here on out, anyone who gets ripped off by payday loan companies—or, say, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-access-consumer-financial-protection-bureau-data/">social media platforms moonlighting as payments services</a>—has lost <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cfpb-trump-freeze-tech-investigations/">their most capable defender</a>.</p><p>Keep going. The thousands of so-called probationary employees DOGE has fired included a significant number of experienced workers who had just been promoted or transferred. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/national-science-foundation-february-2025-firings/">National Science Foundation staffing cuts</a> and proposed <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nih-indirect-funding-cuts-heritage-foundation/">National Institutes of Health grant limits</a> will combine to kneecap scientific research in the United States for a generation. Terminations at the US Department of Agriculture have <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/usda-layoffs-throw-climate-and-crop-projects-into-chaos/">sent programs designed to help farmers into disarray</a>. On Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration <a data-offer-url="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/26/health/news-fda-meeting-to-choose-flu-vaccine-composition-canceled-without-explanation/index.html" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/26/health/news-fda-meeting-to-choose-flu-vaccine-composition-canceled-without-explanation/index.html&quot;}" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/26/health/news-fda-meeting-to-choose-flu-vaccine-composition-canceled-without-explanation/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">canceled a meeting</a> that would have given guidance on this year’s flu vaccine composition.

The National Parks Service, the Internal Revenue Service, all hit hard. So don’t make any long-term bets on getting your checks on time, keeping your lights on, buying a home for the first time, or enjoying Yosemite. Don’t assume all the things that work now will still work tomorrow.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Speaking of which, let’s not forget that DOGE has fired people working to prevent bird flu and to safeguard the US nuclear arsenal. (The problem with throwing a <a data-offer-url="https://www.wsj.com/tech/that-time-elon-musk-showed-up-with-a-chain-sawliterally-6f51d12d" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.wsj.com/tech/that-time-elon-musk-showed-up-with-a-chain-sawliterally-6f51d12d&quot;}" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/that-time-elon-musk-showed-up-with-a-chain-sawliterally-6f51d12d" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">chainsaw</a> around is that you don’t make clean cuts.) The agencies in question have reportedly tried to hire those workers back. Fine. But even if they’re able to, the long-term question that hasn’t been answered yet is, Who would stay? Who would work under a regime so <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-incompetence-mistakes-feature-not-bug/">cocksure and incompetent</a> that it would mistakenly fire the only handful of people who actually know how to take care of the nukes? According to a recent <a data-offer-url="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/inside-doges-dumbest-cut-yet" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.thebulwark.com/p/inside-doges-dumbest-cut-yet&quot;}" href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/inside-doges-dumbest-cut-yet" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">report</a> from The Bulwark, that brain drain is already underway.</p><p>And this is all before the real reductions in force begin, mass purges of civil servants that will soon be conducted, it seems, with an assist from <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-autorif-mass-firing-government-workers/">DOGE-modified, automated software</a>. The US government is about to lose decades of institutional knowledge across who knows how many agencies, including specialists that aren’t readily replaced by loyalists.</p><p>Elon Musk has, at least, acknowledged that DOGE will make mistakes, and promised fast fixes. He even called one out specifically Wednesday, the cancelation of a USAID program designed to prevent the spread of Ebola. “We restored the Ebola prevention immediately,” he said during an appearance at Trump’s first cabinet meeting. “And there was no interruption.”</p><p>This is <a data-offer-url="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/26/elon-musk-ebola-prevention-usaid-doge/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/26/elon-musk-ebola-prevention-usaid-doge/&quot;}" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/26/elon-musk-ebola-prevention-usaid-doge/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">not the case</a>, as The Washington Post first reported. Not only has Ebola prevention not been restored—it was and remains severely diminished—but the Trump administration also said Wednesday it would terminate nearly 10,000 contracts and grants from USAID and the State Department. Many of those contracts represent an attempt to lessen some form of suffering in some part of the world. It’s too many individual stories to tell, too many tragedies unfolding too far away.</p><p>It’s worse than you think in the same way that your brain breaks a little when you try to picture how deep the ocean is. It’s worse than you think because by the time the courts catch up the damage will already have been done. It’s worse than you think because the people running the government seem to have no higher mission than to watch it burn.</p><p>Federal agencies could absolutely be more efficient, but we’re long past the point where efficiency is a plausible goal. DOGE’s cuts have no apparent regard for civil society or opportunity costs or long-term strategic thinking. Their targets are Elon Musk’s and Project 2025’s targets. They have found no fraud, just democracy at work. They’re apparently eager to see what happens when it no longer does.</p><p>It’s worse than you think because so far all DOGE has done is drop a boulder into the middle of a pond.

<p><a href="https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting">pgRouting</a> is a Postgres extension. It's often used for finding the “shortest path” between two locations, however it's a hidden gem in Postgres and can be used for basic graph functionality.</p>

<p>pgRouting is typically combined with PostGIS for working with geospatial data, but it can also be <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26350454">useful beyond that</a> as a lightweight alternative to Graph extensions like <a href="https://age.apache.org/">Apache AGE</a>, or specialized graph databases like <a href="https://neo4j.com/">Neo4j</a>.</p>
<p>Let's explore some useful applications of pgRouting and graphs.</p>

<p>pgRouting is an extension of PostGIS that provides geospatial routing functionality. You can use it to calculate the shortest path, perform network analysis, and solve complex routing problems on a graph-based structure. Most commonly, this is used in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for tasks like determining the fastest route between two locations.</p>


<p>The power of pgRouting lies in its ability to work with any data structured as a graph. A graph is essentially a network of interconnected points, where:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nodes</strong> represent entities.</li>
<li><strong>Edges</strong> represent relationships or paths between those nodes.</li>
</ul>
<p>In maps / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system">GIS</a>, nodes and edges represent intersections and roads respectively. However, this structure can also be applied to abstract systems like a social networks, where users are nodes and friendships are edges.</p>
<!-- -->

<p>Let's explore how pgRouting can be applied to a few non-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system">GIS</a> problems.</p>
<h3 id="task-scheduling">Task scheduling</h3>
<p>In any project, tasks have dependencies. For example, task B can only start after task A is completed. This creates a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">directed acyclic graph</a> (DAG), where:</p>
<ul>
<li>nodes represent tasks</li>
<li>edges represent dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most challenging aspects of managing projects is determining the “critical path” — the project's overall duration, determined by the longest sequence of dependencies.</p>

<p>Using pgRouting, you can model your task's dependencies, using graph algorithms to find the critical path. Suppose we have a table tasks with task dependencies modeled as a graph:</p>

<p>You can then use the <a href="https://docs.pgrouting.org/latest/en/pgr_dijkstra.html"><code>pgr_dijkstra()</code></a> function to find the shortest (or longest) path through the tasks, allowing you to map out the project schedule effectively:</p>

<h3 id="reverse-proxy-routing-based-on-resource-allocation">Reverse proxy routing based on resource allocation</h3>
<p>Distributed systems usually involve allocating resources efficiently across a network of nodes. Each node might represent a physical location or a computing process, and the edges represent the available pathways to move resources between them. For example, in a cloud infrastructure, pgRouting could help determine how to allocate compute tasks across a set of distributed servers by finding the shortest or least-congested path to route data.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a network of servers represented by nodes and their data connections as edges in a table servers.</p>

<h3 id="recommendation-engines-like-youtube">Recommendation engines like YouTube</h3>
<p>In recommendation engines or search algorithms that use knowledge graphs, pgRouting can be used to build relationships between entities and events. Take YouTube's recommendation algorithm, we can structure this data as a graph where:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nodes</strong> represent entities like users, videos, or categories.</li>
<li><strong>Edges</strong> represent relationships or interactions between those entities, such as a user liking a video or videos being part of the same category.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's create a list of “nodes”:</p>
<div><p><code><br><div><p><span>_<!-- -->24</span></p><p><span>create table categories (</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->24</span></p><p><span>  id serial primary key,</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->24</span></p><p><span>  name text</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->24</span></p><p><span>);</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->24</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->24</span></p><p><span>insert into categories (name)</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->24</span></p><p><span>values</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->24</span></p><p><span>  ('Graph Theory'),</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->24</span></p><p><span>  ('AI &amp; Machine Learning'),</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->24</span></p><p><span>  ('Python Programming');</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->24</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->24</span></p><p><span>create table videos (</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->24</span></p><p><span>  id serial primary key,</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->24</span></p><p><span>  title text,</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->24</span></p><p><span>  category_id int references categories (id)</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->24</span></p><p><span>);</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->24</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->24</span></p><p><span>insert into videos (title, category_id)</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->24</span></p><p><span>values</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->24</span></p><p><span>  ('Intro to Graph Theory', 1),</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->24</span></p><p><span>  ('Advanced Graph Algorithms', 1),</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->24</span></p><p><span>  ('Graph Neural Networks', 2),</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->24</span></p><p><span>  ('Beginner Python Tutorial', 3),</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->24</span></p><p><span>  ('Advanced Python Techniques', 3);</span></p></div><br></code></p></div>

<p>Now we can use the <code>pgr_dijkstra()</code> function to find the shortest or most relevant path between a user and new videos. For example, let's find videos that are most relevant to <code>user_01</code> considering their past interactions:</p>
<details><summary>Tangent: ranking recommendations</summary><p>Since it's “just postgres” it's simple enough to rank the results using an <code>order by</code> clause. For example, if we stored the <code>pgr_dijkstra()</code> results above in a table called “recommendations”, we use this a query like this to sort the paths by the highest ranking:</p><div><p><code><br><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>select videos.title, sum(weight) as recommendation_score</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>from</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>  recommendations</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>  join videos on recommendations.target = videos.id</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>group by videos.title</span></p></div><div><p><span>_<!-- -->10</span></p><p><span>order by recommendation_score desc;</span></p></div><br></code></p></div></details>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The NVIDIA RIVA 128 is a graphics card released in 1997 by NVIDIA, nowadays of AI and $2000 overpriced quad-slot GPU fame. It was a Direct3D 5.0-capable accelerator, and one of the first to use a standard graphics API such as DirectX as its “native” API. I have been working on emulating this graphics card for the last several months; currently, while VGA works and the drivers are loading successfully on Windows 2000, they are not rendering any kind of accelerated output yet. Many people, myself included, have asked for and even tried to develop emulation for this graphics card and other similar cards (such as its successor, “NV4” or RIVA TNT), but have not succeeded yet, although many of these efforts continue. This is the first part of a series where I explore the architecture and my experiences in emulating this graphics card. I can’t guarantee success, but if it was successful, it appears that it would be the first time that a full functional emulation of this card has been developed; although later NVIDIA cards have been emulated to at least some extent, such as the GeForce 3 in Cxbx-Reloaded and Xemu.</p>

<p>This is the first part in a series of blog posts that aims to demystify, once and for all, NVIDIA RIVA 128. This first part will dive into the history of NVIDIA up to the release of the RIVA 128, and a brief overview of how the chip actually works. The second part will dive into the architecture of NVIDIA’s drivers and how they relate to the hardware, and the third part will follow the lifetime of a graphics object from birth to display on the screen in extreme detail. Then, part four and an unknown number of parts after part four will go into detail on the experiences of developing a functional emulation for this graphics card.</p>

<h2 id="a-not-so-brief-history">A not so brief history</h2>

<h3 id="beginnings">Beginnings</h3>

<p>NVIDIA was conceived in 1992 by three LSI Logic and Sun Microsystems engineers: Jensen Huang (now one of the world’s richest men, still the CEO and, apparently, mobbed by fans in his country of birth Taiwan), Curtis Priem (whose boss almost convinced him to work on Java instead of founding the company) and Chris Malachowsky (a veteran of graphics chip development). They saw a business opportunity in the PC graphics and audio market, which was dominated by low-end, high-volume players such as S3 Graphics, Tseng Labs, Cirrus Logic and Matrox<sup id="fnref:matrox" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:matrox" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. The company was formally founded on April 5, 1993, after all three left their jobs at LSI Logic and Sun between December 1992 and March 1993.</p>

<p>After the requisite $3 million of venture capital funding was acquired (a little nepotism owing to their reputation helped), work immediately began on a first generation graphics chip; this was one of the first of a rush of dozens of companies attempting to develop graphics cards - both established players in the 2D graphics market such as Number Nine and S3, and new companies, almost all of which no longer exist - many of which failed to even release a single graphics card. The name was initially GXNV for “GX next version”, after a graphics chip Malachowsky led the development of at Sun, but Huang requested him to rename the chip to NV1 in order to not get sued. This also inspired the name of the company - NVIDIA, after other names such as “Primal Graphics” and “Huaprimal” were considered and rejected, and their originally chosen name of “Invision” turned out to have been trademarked by a toilet paper company.</p>

<p>In a perhaps ironic twist of fate, toilet paper turned out to be an apt metaphor for the sales, if not quality, of their first product, which Jensen Huang appears to be embarassed to discuss when asked, and has been quoted as saying “You don’t build NV1 because you’re great”. The product was released in 1995 after a two-year development cycle and the creation of what NVIDIA dubbed a hardware simulator, but actually appears to have been simply a set of Windows 3.x drivers intended to emulate their architecture, called the NV0 in 1994.</p>

<h3 id="the-nv1">The NV1</h3>

<p>The <strong>NV1</strong> was a combination graphics, audio, DRM (yes, really) and game port card implementing what NVIDIA dubbed the “NV Unified Media Architecture” (UMA); the chip was manufactured by SGS-Thomson Microelectronics (now STMicroelectronics) on a 350-nanometer process node, who also white-labelled NVIDIA’s design (which allegedly<sup id="fnref:contract" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:contract" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> featured a DAC block designed by SGS-Thomson) as the STG-2000, a variant without audio functionality, also called the “NV1-V32” (for 32-bit VRAM) in internal documentation as opposed to NVIDIA’s NV1-D64. The chip was designed to implement a reasonable level of 3D graphics functionality, as well as audio, public-key encryption for DRM purposes (ultimately never used as it would have required the cooperation of software companies) and Sega Saturn game ports, all within a single megabyte of RAM, as memory costs were around $50 a megabyte when initial design began in 1993.</p>

<p>In order to achieve this, many techniques had to be used that ultimately compromised the chip’s 3D rendering quality, such as forward texture mapping, where a texel (output pixel) of a texture is directly mapped to a point on the screen, instead of the more traditional inverse texture mapping, which iterates through pixels and maps texels from those. While this has memory space advantages (as you can cache the texture in the very limited amount of VRAM NVIDIA had to work with very easily), it has many more disadvantages; firstly, this approach does not support UV mapping (a special coordinate system used to map textures to three-dimensional objects) and other aspects of what would be considered to be today basic graphical functionality.</p>

<p>Additionally, the fundamental implementation of 3D rendering used quad patching instead of traditional triangle-based approaches; this has very advantageous implications for things like curved surfaces, and may have been a very effective design for the CAD/CAM customers purchasing more high end 3D products, however, it turned out to not be particularly useful at all for the actually intended target market of gaming. There was also a total lack of Sound Blaster compatibility (very much a requirement for half-decent audio in games back then) in the audio engine, and VGA compatibility was very slow and partially emulated, which led to slow performance in the games people <em>actually played</em>, unless your favourite game was a crappier, slower version of <em>Descent</em>, <em>Virtua Cop</em> or <em>Daytona USA</em> for some reason. Another body blow to NVIDIA was received when Microsoft released Direct3D in 1996 with DirectX 2.0, which not only used triangles, but also became the standard 3D API and deprecated all of the numerous non-OpenGL proprietary APIs of the time, including S3’s S3D and MeTaL<sup id="fnref:metal" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:metal" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, ATI’s 3DCIF, and NVIDIA’s own NVLIB.</p>

<p>The upshot of all of this was what can be understood as nothing less than the total failure of NVIDIA to sell or convince anyone to develop for NV1 in any way, despite its innovative silicon design. While Diamond Multimedia purchased 250,000 chips to place into their “Edge 3D” series of cards, and other manufacturers produced cards in smaller quantities, barely any of them sold, and those that did sell were often returned, leading to the chips themselves being returned to NVIDIA and hundreds of thousands of chips sitting simply unused in warehouses. Barely any NV1-capable software was released, with the few pieces of software that do exist coming via a partnership with Sega (more on that later), while most others were forced to run under software emulators for Direct3D (or other APIs) written by Priem, which were made possible by the software architecture NVIDIA chose for their drivers, but were slower and worse-looking than software rendering, buggy, and generally extremely unappealing.</p>

<p>NVIDIA lost $6.4 million in 1995 on a revenue of $1.1 million, and $3 million on a revenue of $3.9 million in 1996. Most of the capital that allowed NVIDIA to continue operating were from the milestone payments from SGS-Thomson for developing the chip, their NV2 contract with Sega (again, more on that later), and their venture capital funding, but not from the very few NV1 sales. The NV1 was poorly reviewed, had very little software and ultimately almost no sales; despite various desperate efforts to revive it, including releasing the SDK for free (with a new proprietary <em>NVLIB</em> API for game development as an alternative to direct hardware programming) and by early 1996 straight up begging customers on their website to spam developers with requests to add NV1 support to games, the chip was effectively dead within a year.</p>

<h3 id="the-nv2">The NV2</h3>

<p>Nevertheless, NVIDIA grew to close to a hundred employees, including sales and marketing teams. The company, and especially its cofounders, remained confident in their architecture and overall prospects of success. They had managed to solidify a business relationship with Sega, to the point where they had initially won the contract to provide the graphics hardware for the successor to the Sega Saturn, at that time codenamed “V08”. The GPU was codenamed “Mutara” (after the nebula critical to the plot in <em>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</em>) and the overall architecture was the <strong>NV2</strong>. It maintained many of the functional characteristics of the NV1 and was essentially a more powerful successor to that chip. According to available sources, this would have been the only NVIDIA chip manufactured by the then-just founded Helios Semiconductor.</p>

<p>However, problems started to emerge almost immediately. Game developers, especially Sega’s internal teams, were not happy with having to use a GPU with such a heterodox design; for example, porting games to or from the PC, which Sega did do at the time, would be made far harder. This position was especially championed by Yu Suzuki, head of one of Sega’s most prestigious internal development teams Sega-AM2, responsible for the <em>Daytona USA</em>, <em>Virtua Racing</em>, <em>Virtua Fighter</em>, and <em>Shenmue</em> series among others, who sent his best graphics programmer to interface with NVIDIA and push for the company to change the rendering method to a more traditional triangle-based approach. At this point, the story diverges: some tellings claim that NVIDIA simply refused to accede to Sega’s request and this damaged their relationship irreparably, leading to the NV2’s cancellation; others that the NV2 wasn’t killed until it failed to produce any video during a demonstration, and Sega still paid NVIDIA for developing it to prevent bankruptcy, with a single engineer apparently assigned to (and succeeding at) getting the chip working for the sole purpose of receiving a milestone payment.</p>

<p>At some point, Sega, as a traditional Japanese company, couldn’t simply kill the deal, so the NV2 was officially relegated to be used in the successor to the educational toddler-aimed Sega Pico, while in reality, Sega of America had already been told to “not worry” about NVIDIA anymore. NVIDIA got the hint, and the NV2 was cancelled. With both NV1 and NV2 out of the picture, NVIDIA had no sales, no customers, and barely any money; by late 1996, the company had $3 million in the bank and was burning through $330,000 a month, and most of the NV2 team had been redeployed to the next-generation NV3. No venture capital funding was going to be forthcoming due to the failure to actually create any products people wanted to buy, at least not without extremely unfavourable terms on things like ownership. The company was effectively almost a complete failure and a waste of years of the employees’ time.</p>

<h3 id="near-destruction-of-the-company">Near destruction of the company</h3>

<p>By the end of 1996, things had gotten infinitely worse, with the competition heating up extraordinarily fast; despite NV1 being the first texture-mapped consumer GPU ever released, they had been fundamentally outclassed by their competition. It was a one-two punch: initially, Rendition - founded around the same time as NVIDIA in 1993 - released its V1000 chip based on a custom RISC architecture, and while not particularly fast, it was, for a few months, the only chip that could run Quake (the hottest game of 1996) in hardware accelerated mode. The V1000 was an early market leader, alongside S3’s laughably bad ViRGE (Video and Rendering Graphics Engine) which was infamously slower than software rendering on high-end CPUs at launch, and was reserved for high-volume OEM bargain-bin disaster machines.</p>

<p>However, this was nothing compared to the body blow about to hit the entire industry, NVIDIA included. At a conference in early 1996, an $80,000 machine from SiliconGraphics, then the world leader in accelerated graphics, crashed during a demo by the then-CEO Ed McCracken. If accounts of the event are to be believed, while the machine rebooted, people who had heard rumors left the room and headed downstairs to another demo by a then-tiny company made up of ex-SGI employes calling themselves “3D/fx” (later shortened to 3dfx), claiming comparable graphics quality for $250… with demos to prove it. As with many cases of supposed “wonder innovations” in the tech industry, it was too good to be true, but when their card, the “Voodoo Graphics” was first released in the form of the “Righteous 3D” by Orchid in October 1996, it turned out to be true. Despite the fact that it was a 3D-only card and required a 2D card to be installed, and the fact it could not accelerate graphics in a window (which almost all other cards could do), performance was so high relative to other products (including the NV1) that it not only had rave reviews on its own but also kicked off a revolution in consumer 3D graphics, which especially caught fire when GLQuake was released in January 1997.</p>

<p>The reasons for 3dfx being able to design such an effective GPU when all others failed were numerous. The price of RAM plummeted by 80% throughout 1996, allowing the Voodoo’s estimated retail price to be cut from $1000 to $300; many of their staff members came from SiliconGraphics, perhaps the most respected and certainly the largest company in the graphics industry of that time<sup id="fnref:sgi" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sgi" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>; and while the Voodoo used a proprietary API called Glide, it also supported OpenGL and Direct3D. Glide was designed to be very similar to OpenGL while allowing for 3dfx to approximate standard graphical techniques, which, as well as their driver design; the Voodoo only accelerates edge interpolation<sup id="fnref:edge" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:edge" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>, texture mapping and blending, span interpolation<sup id="fnref:span" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:span" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>, and final presentation of the rendered 3D scene, while the rest is all done in software. All of these factors were key in what proved to be an exceptionally high-quality product at an exceptionally low price for the time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, NVIDIA effectively had to design a graphics architecture that could at the very least get close to 3dfx’s performance, on a shoestring budget and with very little resources, as 60% of their staff (including the entire sales and marketing teams) had been laid off to preserve money. They could not do a complete redesign of the NV1 from scratch if they felt the need to, as it would take two years (time they simply didn’t have) and any design that came out of this effort would be immediately obsoleted by competitors, such as 3dfx’s Voodoo series, and ATI’s Rage which was initially rather pointless but rapidly advancing in performance and driver stability. The chip would also have to work reasonably well on the first tapeout, as there was no capital to produce more revisions of the chip. The fact NVIDIA were able to achieve a successful design in the form of the NV3 under such conditions was a testament to the intelligence, skill and luck of their designers; we will explore how they managed to achieve this later on this write-up.</p>

<h3 id="the-nv3">The NV3</h3>

<p>It was with these financial, competitive and time constraints in mind that design on the NV3 began in 1996. This chip would eventually be commercialised as the RIVA 128, standing for “Real-time Interactive Video and Animation accelerator” followed by a nod to its 128-bit internal bus width, which was very large for the time. NVIDIA retained SGS-Thomson (soon to be STMicroelectronics) as their manufacturing partner, in exchange for SGS-Thomson cancelling their competing STG-3001 GPU. In a similar vein to the NV1, NVIDIA was to sell the chip as “NV3” and SGS-Thomson was to white-label it as STG-3000, once again separated by audio functionality; however, NVIDIA convinced SGS-Thomson to cancel their own part and stick to manufacturing the NV3 instead, which later proved to be a terrible decision when NVIDIA dropped them in favor of TSMC for manufacturing of the RIVA 128 ZX due to both yield issues and pressure from venture capital funders. ST went on to manufacture the PowerVR Kyro series of GPU chips before dropping out of the market entirely by 2002.</p>

<p>After the NV2 disaster, the company made several calls on the NV3’s design that turned out to be very good decisions. First, they acquiesced to Sega’s advice (which they might have already done to save the Mutara V08/NV2, but it was too late) and moved to an inverse texture mapping triangle-based model, although some remnants of the original quad patching design remain. The unused DRM functionality was also removed, which may have been assisted by David Kirk<sup id="fnref:dkirk" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:dkirk" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> taking over from Curtis Priem as chief designer, as Priem insisted on including the DRM functionality with the NV1, citing piracy issues with the game he had written as a demo of the Malachowsky-designed GX GPU back when he worked at Sun.</p>

<p>Another decision that turned out to pay very large dividends was deciding to forgo a native API entirely and build the card around accelerating the most popular graphical APIs, which led to an initial focus on Direct3D, although OpenGL drivers were first publicly released in alpha form in December 1997 and fully in early 1998. DirectX 3.0 was the initial target, and after 4.0 was <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20040122-00/?p=40963">cancelled due to lack of developer interest in its new functionality</a>, 5.0 came out late during development of the chip, which turned out to be mostly compliant, with the exception of some blending modes such as additive blending which Jensen Huang later claimed was due to Microsoft not giving them the specification in time. This compliance was made much easier by the design of their driver, which allowed (and still allows) graphical APIs to be plugged in as “clients” to the Resource Manager kernel; as I mentioned earlier, this will be explained in full detail later.</p>

<p>The VGA core, previously so separate from the main GPU on the NV1 that it had its own PCI ID, was replaced by a new one licensed from Weitek who would soon exit the graphics market. The core was placed in the chip parallel to the main GPU with its own 32-bit bus, which massively accelerated performance in unaccelerated VESA titles such as <em>Doom</em>, and provided a real advantage over the 3D-only 3dfx cards, especially as their combination SST-96 or Voodoo Rush card used a questionable Alliance chip and was generally considered a failure. Finally, Huang, in his capacity as the CEO, allowed the chip to be expanded (in terms of physical size and number of gates) from its original specification, allowing for a more complex design with more features.</p>

<p>The initial revision of the architecture appears to have been completed in January 1997. Then, aided by hardware simulation software (an actual hardware simulation unlike the NV0) purchased from another almost-bankrupt company, an exhaustive test set was completed. The first bug presented itself almost immediately when the “C” character in the MS-DOS codepage appeared incorrectly, Windows took 15 minutes to boot, and moving the mouse cursor required a map of the screen so you didn’t lose it by moving too far, but ultimately the testing was completed. However, NVIDIA didn’t have the money to respin the silicon for a second stepping if problems appeared, so it had to work at least reasonably well in the first stepping.</p>

<h3 id="riva-128">RIVA 128</h3>

<p>Luckily for NVIDIA, the NV3 chip worked well enough to be sold to their board partners (almost certainly thanks to that hardware simulation package), and the company survived. Most accounts indicate they were only three or four weeks away from bankruptcy; when 3dfx saw the RIVA 128 at its reveal at the CGDC 1997 conference, one founder responded with “you guys are still around?”, considering 3dfx almost <em>bought</em> NVIDIA effectively for the purpose of killing the company as a theoretical competitor, but NVIDIA refused as they assumed they would be bankrupt within months anyway. However, this revision A of the chip was not the one NVIDIA actually commercialised; SGS-Thomson dropped their plans for the STG-3000 at some point, which led NVIDIA, now flush with cash<sup id="fnref:revenue" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:revenue" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>, to create a new revision of the chip to remove the sound functionality (although some parts remained), fix some errata and make other minor adjustments to the silicon.</p>

<p>The chip was respun, with the revision B silicon being completed in October 1997 and presumably available a month or two later; it is most likely that some revision A cards were sold at retail, but based on the dates, these would have to be very early units<sup id="fnref:stb" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:stb" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>, with the earliest NVIDIA RIVA 128 drivers that I have discovered (labelled as “Version 0.75” and also doubling as the only NV1 drivers for Windows NT) being dated August 1997, and reviews starting to drop on websites such as AnandTech in the first half of September 1997. There are no known drivers available for the audio functionality in the revision A RIVA 128, so anyone wishing to use it would have to write custom drivers.</p>

<p>The RIVA 128 was generally well-reviewed at its launch and considered as the fastest graphics chip released in 1997, beating the Voodoo1 in raw speed but not output video quality, most likely due to NVIDIA’s financial situation leading to rushed development of the chip with shortcuts taken in the design process in order to ship on time. Examples of this lower quality include the lack of support for some of Direct3D 5.0’s blending modes, and the use of per-polygon mipmapping<sup id="fnref:mipmap" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:mipmap" rel="footnote">10</a></sup> instead of the more accurate per-pixel approach, causing seams between different mipmapping layers; the dithering and bilinear texture filtering quality were often criticised as well, and some games exhibited seams between polygons. Furthermore, the drivers were generally very rough at launch, especially if the graphics card was an upgrade and previous drivers were not; while NVIDIA were able to fix many driver issues by the 3.xx versions released in 1998 and 1999, going as far as writing a fairly decent OpenGL ICD, the standards for graphical quality had risen over time and what was considered “decent” in 1997 was considered to be “bad” and even “awful” by 1999.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, over a million RIVA 128 units sold within a few months, and NVIDIA’s immediate existence as a company was secured; an enhanced version (revision C, also called “NV3T”) was released in March 1998 as the RIVA 128 ZX, in order to compete with the Intel/Lockheed Martin i740, a chip which was hyped as being very fast on paper but turned out to be not very good, leading to Intel starting their long line of sub-par integrated GPUs before finally returning to the discrete market in recent years under the Arc brand, with the current Battlemage line being their <em>13th or 16th generation</em> product depending on who you ask.</p>

<p>After all of this history and exposition, we are finally ready to actually explore the GPU behind the RIVA 128 series. I refer to it as NV3 as a catch-all term for all chips using this architecture, including the RIVA 128, RIVA 128 ZX, and the hypothetical STG-3000. Note that the 32-bit Weitek VGA core’s architecture will not be discussed at length here unless absolutely required, as it is pretty much a standard SVGA core, and really is not that interesting compared to the main GPU; they’re not even substantially integrated, although there are a few areas in the design that allow the main GPU to write directly to the Weitek’s registers.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="architectural-overview">Architectural overview</h2>

<p>NV3 is the third-generation NV architecture designed by NVIDIA in 1997, commercialised as the RIVA 128 family. It implements a fixed-function 2D and 3D render path primarily aimed at desktop software and video games, with hardware acceleration best described as partial by modern standards, but one of the more complete, fully-featured solutions for 1997. It can be attached through the legacy PCI 2.1 bus or AGP 1X (2X on the RIVA 128 ZX), a higher-speed superset of PCI designed for graphics which was brand new at the time but ultimately proved successful.</p>

<p>The primary goals of this architecture were low manufacturing cost, short development time (due to NVIDIA’s dire financial condition at the time), and beating the 3dfx Voodoo1 in raw pixel pushing performance. It generally achieved these goals with caveats, with a bulk cost of $15 per chip, a design period of around 9 months (excluding Revision B), and performance generally better than that of the Voodoo, in spite of 3dfx’s more integrated Glide API, and NVIDIA’s smaller performance advantage with large triangles as compared to smaller ones.</p>

<p>While the focus of study has been the Revision B card, efforts have been made to understand the A and C revisions as well. Each revision has different values for the GPU ID in the framebuffer boot configuration register in MMIO space (at offset <code>0x100000</code>) and the PCI configuration space Revision ID register:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Revision</th>
      <th>NV_PFB_BOOT_0 value</th>
      <th>PCI revision ID</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>A</td>
      <td><code>0x30100</code></td>
      <td><code>0x00</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>B</td>
      <td><code>0x30110</code></td>
      <td><code>0x10</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>C</td>
      <td><code>0x30120</code></td>
      <td><code>0x20</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>There is a common misconception that the PCI ID is different on RIVA 128 ZX chips; this is partially true, but misleading. The standard NV3 architecture uses a PCI vendor ID of <code>0x12D2</code> (identified as “NVidia / SGS Thomson (Joint Venture)” by <a href="https://pci-ids.ucw.cz/">The PCI ID Repository</a>) instead of NVIDIA’s own <code>0x10DE</code>, with a device ID of <code>0x0018</code>, or <code>0x0019</code> on a RIVA 128 ZX with ACPI enabled. However, the presence of a <code>0x0019</code> device ID is not sufficient for a RIVA 128 ZX to be detected as such; the revision must be C, or <code>0x20</code>, regardless of device ID, as confirmed through VBIOS and driver reverse engineering. Since the device ID can be either value, the best way to check is to use the revision ID encoded into the board at manufacturing time, through the NV_PFB_BOOT_0 register or PCI configuration space.</p>

<p>The NV3 architecture incorporates accelerated triangle setup (the Voodoo is limited to around 2/3 of that), the aforementioned span and edge interpolation, texture mapping, blending, and final presentation. It does not accelerate the initial polygon transformation or lighting rendering phases. It is capable of rendering in 2D at a resolution of up to 1280x1024 (at least 1600x1200 in ZX, not sure what?) and 32-bit colour. 3D rendering is only possible in 16-bit colour, and at 960x720 or lower in a 4 MB card due to a lack of VRAM. EDID is supported for monitor identification via an entirely software-programmed I2C bus.</p>

<p>While 2 MB and even 1 MB cards were planned, they were seemingly never released. The level of pain of using them can only be imagined; there were also low-end cards released that only used a 64-bit bus, handled using a manufacture-time configuration mechanism (sometimes exposed via DIP switches) known as straps, which will be explained in Part 2. To compete with the i740, the RIVA 128 ZX had, among other changes that will be described later, an increased amount of VRAM (8 MB) also allowing it to render 3D at higher resolutions of up to 1280x1024.</p>

<p>The design of the RIVA is very complex compared to other contemporaneous video cards. I am not sure why such a complex design was used, but it was inherited from the NV1; the only real reason I can think of is that the overengineered design is intended to be future-proof and easy to enhance without requiring complete rewiring of the silicon, as many other companies had to do. The GPU is split into a around a dozen subsystems (functional hardware blocks), each with names starting in <code>P</code> for some reason; some examples are <code>PGRAPH</code>, <code>PTIMER</code>, <code>PFIFO</code>, <code>PRAMDAC</code> and <code>PBUS</code>. Presumably, a subsystem has a 1:1 mapping with a functional block on the GPU die, since the registers are named after the subsystem that they are a part of.</p>

<p>There are several hundred different registers across the entire graphics card, so things are necessarily simplified for brevity, at least in Part 1. To be honest, the architecture of this graphics card is too complicated to show in a diagram without simplifying things so much as to be effectively pointless or complicating it to the point of not being useful (I tried!), so a diagram has not been provided.</p>

<h3 id="fundamental-concept-the-scene-graph">Fundamental concept: the scene graph</h3>

<p>In order to begin this journey through the NVIDIA NV3 architecture, you must understand the fundamental concept of a scene graph. Although the architecture does not strictly implement a scene graph, knowing the concept helps understand how graphical objects are represented by the GPU. A scene graph is a description of a form of tree where the nodes of the tree are graphical objects, and the properties of a parent object cascade down to its children.</p>

<p>This is how almost all modern game engines (Unity, Unreal, Godot…) represent 3D space. A very easy way to understand how a scene graph works is - I am not joking - install Roblox Studio, place some objects into the scene, save it as an <code>RBXLX</code> file (not the default), and open it in a text editor of your choice. You will see an XML representation of the scene you have created as a scene graph; the only caveat is that on Roblox, the cascading of characteristics from parent nodes to children is optional.</p>

<p>The scene graph is almost certainly the namesake for the functional block actually implementing the 2D and 3D drawing engine that makes the GPU, well, a GPU: <code>PGRAPH</code>. This part has survived from the very first NV1 all the way to the current Blackwell (RTX 5000) architecture; NVIDIA have never done a ground-up redesign since initial development of the NV1 architecture began in 1993, although the Ship of Theseus argument applies here.</p>

<h3 id="clocks">Clocks</h3>

<p>The RIVA 128 is not dependent on the host machine’s clock. It has a 13.5 or 14.3 MHz (depending on boot-time configuration) clock crystal, split by the hardware into a memory clock (MCLK) and video clock (VCLK). Note that these names are misleading; the MCLK also handles the chip’s actual rendering and timing, with the VCLK seemingly just handling the actual pushing out of frames.</p>

<p>The actual clocks are controlled by registers in <code>PRAMDAC</code> set by the video BIOS, which can later be overridden by drivers. In this iteration of the NVIDIA architecture, the VBIOS only performs a very basic POST sequence, initialises the card and sets its clock speed; once the chip is initialised, the VBIOS is effectively never needed again, although there are mechanisms to read from it after initialisation. Clocks were controlled by card manufacturers through parameters <code>m</code>/<code>n</code>/<code>p</code>, from which the chip derives the final memory and pixel clock speed with the formula <code>(frequency * n) / (m &lt;&lt; p)</code>. Generally, most manufacturers set the memory clock at around 100 MHz, and the pixel clock at around 40 MHz, although drivers seemingly reduce these clocks in some cases.</p>

<p>The chip’s RAMDAC handles final conversion of the digital image generated by the GPU into an analog video signal, and clock generation via three phase-locked loops. It has its own clock (ACLK) running at around 200 MHz on RIVA 128 (revision A/B) and 260 MHz on RIVA 128 ZX (revision C) chips, which unlike the other clocks, was not configurable by manufacturers.</p>

<h3 id="memory-mapping">Memory mapping</h3>

<p>Before we can discuss any part of how the RIVA 128 works, its memory architecture must be explained, since this is a fundamental requirement to even access the graphics card’s registers in the first place. NVIDIA picked a fairly strange memory mapping architecture, at least for cards of that time. The exact setup of the memory mapping changed numerous times as NVIDIA’s architecture evolved, so only NV3-based GPUs will be analyzed.</p>

<p>The memory mapping is split into three primary components, all exposed via memory-mapped I/O through Base Address Registers (BAR) in PCI configuration space; there is no port I/O support outside of the Weitek core’s registers for SVGA compatibility. The RIVA 128 uses two BARs, both 16 MB in size: BAR0 holding the main GPU registers, and BAR1 holding the <code>DFB</code> and <code>RAMIN</code> areas (which really refer to overlapping areas of memory).</p>

<h4 id="mmio">MMIO</h4>

<p>This is the primary memory mapping area, set up as Base Address Register 0 in the PCI configuration registers. This is how you speak to the GPU: 16 MB (!) of MMIO, mapped at a memory location defined by the system BIOS. Since the video BIOS has no access to PCI services, it instead uses I/O ports <code>0x3D0</code>-<code>0x3D3</code> in the Weitek SVGA core, mapped to a mechanism called RMA (Real Mode Access); a 32-bit address is formed by writing to all four RMA registers, then the next read/write to the VGA I/O region is redirected to the MMIO area, allowing the VBIOS to access it from real mode and initialise the GPU.</p>

<p>This MMIO area has numerous functional subsystems of the GPU mapped into it, with some overlap. The actual function of each graphics object will be described later.</p>

<h4 id="dfb">DFB</h4>

<p><code>DFB</code> is the aptly-named “Dumb Framebuffer”, a linear framebuffer set up as Base Address Register 1 on the NV3 (moved to BAR0 at <code>0x1000000</code> on later GPUs). The default size of 4 MB may change depending on VRAM size. This area is presumably meant for manipulating the GPU without using its DMA facilities.</p>

<h4 id="ramin">RAMIN</h4>

<p><code>RAMIN</code> is also located in BAR1. It’s a somewhat complicated area, but also the most important one to understand when it comes to the actual operation of the GPU, as it’s the part of video RAM where graphics objects and structures containing references to them are stored.</p>

<p>This area is effectively the last megabyte of VRAM (regardless of VRAM size), but organized as 16-byte blocks which are then stored from the top down. A <code>RAMIN</code> address can be converted to a real VRAM address with the formula <code>ramin_address ^ (vram_size - 16)</code>. I’m not entirely sure why they did this, but I assume it was for providing a more convenient interface to the user and for general efficiency reasons.</p>

<h3 id="interrupts">Interrupts</h3>

<p>A traditional interrupt system is implemented, supporting interrupts issued by different GPU components. <code>PMC</code> contains an interrupt status register and an interrupt enable register, with one bit for each component (including the eventually-removed <code>PAUDIO</code>), as well as a software interrupt represented by bit 31; components also have a local status register and enable register, with each bit representing an individual interrupt from that block. If the <code>PMC</code> interrupt status and enable bits for a given component are both 1, with some minor exceptions to be explained in later parts, an interrupt is declared to be pending and a PCI IRQ is sent.</p>

<p>Interrupts can be turned off globally (or just component interrupts, or just the software interrupt) via the <code>PMC_INTR_EN</code> register.</p>

<h3 id="programmable-interval-timer">Programmable interval timer</h3>

<p>Time-sensitive functions are provided by a relatively simple programmable interval timer <code>PTIMER</code> that fires an interrupt whenever the threshold value (set by the <code>PTIMER_ALARM</code>) is exceeded in nanoseconds. This is how the drivers internally keep track of many actions that they need to perform, and is the first functional block which must be done right if you ever hope to emulate the RIVA 128.</p>

<p>The least straightforward part of this timer is the counter itself, a 56-bit value split across two 32-bit registers: the lower 27 bits are stored in bits [31:5] of <code>PTIMER_TIME0</code>, and the upper 29 bits are stored in bits [28:0] of <code>PTIMER_TIME1</code>.</p>

<h3 id="graphics-commands-and-dma-engine">Graphics commands and DMA engine</h3>

<p>What may be called <em>graphics commands</em> in other GPU architectures are instead called <em>graphics objects</em> in the NV3 and all other NVIDIA architectures. Objects are submitted into the GPU core by writing into the <code>NV_USER</code> section of the MMIO BAR0 region through programmed I/O. Despite the fact that a custom memory access engine with its own translation lookaside buffer and other memory management structures was implemented for graphics object types that perform memory transfers, it does not seem to be used for graphics object submission until the NV4 architecture. Existing documentation is contradictory on whether or not this exists on the NV3, but drivers do not seem to use DMA to submit graphics objects; if a DMA submission method exists, it certainly works very differently to later versions of the architecture.</p>

<p>There are 8 DMA channels, with the default being channel 0 (also the only channel accessible through PIO?), but only one can be used at a time; using other channels requires a <em>context switch</em>, which entails writing the current channel ID to to <code>PGRAPH</code> registers for every class. All DMA channels use 64 KB of <code>RAMIN</code> memory (to be explained later), further divided into 8 KB (<code>0x2000</code>) subchannels, effectively representing one object; the meaning of what is in those subchannels depends on the type (or <em>class</em> to use NVIDIA terminology) of the object submitted into them, with the attributes of each object being called a <em>method</em>. A simple way to program the GPU is to just create subchannels for specific objects (such as one for text, one for rectangle, and so on) and change their data and methods as the program runs in order to create a graphical effect; however, this is a severely limited approach<sup id="fnref:nt" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:nt" rel="footnote">12</a></sup>, and tapping the chip’s full potential requires the use of context switches between DMA channels, as well as the additional classes implemented in software by the drivers.</p>

<p>All objects have a <em>context</em>, consisting of a 32-bit “name” and another 32-bit value storing its class, associated channel and subchannel ID, where it is relative to the start of <code>RAMIN</code>, and whether it’s a software-injected or hardware graphical rendering object (bit 31). Contexts are stored in an area of RAM called <code>RAMFC</code> if the object’s channel is not being used; otherwise, they are stored in <code>RAMHT</code>, a <em>hash table</em> where the hash key is a single byte calculated by XORing each byte of the object’s name<sup id="fnref:htdriver" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:htdriver" rel="footnote">13</a></sup> as well as the channel ID. Objects are stored in <code>RAMHT</code> as structures consisting of their 8-byte context followed by the <em>methods</em> mentioned earlier; an object’s byte offset in <code>RAMHT</code> is its hash multiplied by 16.</p>

<p>The exact set of methods of every graphics object in the architecture is incredibly long and often shared between several different types of objects (although the first 256 bytes and usually a few more after that are shared), and thus won’t be listed in part 1. An overall list of graphics objects can be found in the next section, but note that these are the ones defined by the hardware, while the drivers implement a much larger set of objects that do not map exactly to the ones in the GPU; furthermore, as you will see later, as each object is quite large at 8 KB, only one object does not mean only one (or even any at all - some are used to represent DMA objects, for example) graphics objects are drawn once the object is process. Objects can also be connected together with a special type of object called a “patchcord” constructed by the Resource Manager; the name is a remnant from the old NV1 quad patching days.</p>

<p>After being written to <code>NV_USER</code>, graphics objects are sent to one of two caches within the <code>PFIFO</code> subsystem: <code>CACHE0</code> which holds a single entry (really intended for the <a href="#interrupts-20-notifiers">notifier engine</a> to be able to inject graphics commands from software), or <code>CACHE1</code> which holds 32 entries on revisions A-B and 64 on revision C onwards. What these critical components actually do will be explored in full in later parts, but they effectively just store object names and contexts as they are waiting to be sent to <code>RAMIN</code>; a “pusher” pushes objects in from the bus as they are written into <code>NV_USER</code>, and a “puller” pulls them out of the bus and sends them where they need to be inside of the VRAM (or to <code>RAMRO</code> if they are invalid).</p>

<p>Once objects are pulled out, the GPU will simply manipulate the various registers in the <code>PGRAPH</code> subsystem in order to draw the object (if the object is actually rendered), and/or perform any DMA operations the graphics object may require using the DMA engine. Objects do not appear to “disappear” on frame refresh; instead, it would simply appear that they are simply drawn over, and most likely, any renderer will simply clear the entire screen (with a <em>Rectangle</em> object for instance) before resubmitting any graphics objects they need to render.</p>

<p>Both <code>RAMFC</code> and <code>RAMHT</code> can have their sizes, and to some extent their location within RAMIN, configured by registers within the <code>PFIFO</code> block. <code>RAMHT</code> can be 4 KB (of questionable usefulness as that cannot fill <code>CACHE1</code>), 8 KB, 16 KB, or 32 KB in size, while RAMFC is either 512 bytes or 8 KB.</p>

<h4 id="object-list">Object list</h4>

<p>Any class values not listed here are invalid; in theory, the 5-bit value in the object context allows for 32 classes, but NVIDIA did not implement the full amount, and moved to a different approach (where the classes are somewhat more constructed in software) with the NV4 architecture.</p>

<p><strong><code>0x01</code> (Beta factor):</strong> The beta factor used for blending operations. (combining an output pixel with another pixel to produce a final image)</p>

<p><strong><code>0x02</code> (ROP5 operation):</strong> The Render OPeration used for blending. (e.g. XOR)</p>

<p><strong><code>0x03</code> (Chroma Key):</strong> Similar to a color key used in video editing.</p>

<p><strong><code>0x04</code> (Plane mask):</strong> Seems to be implemented similarly to <em>Chroma Key</em>, not sure what it has to do with planes. (bitplane? 2D plane?)</p>

<p><strong><code>0x05</code> (Clipping rectangle):</strong> A rectangle used for enabling/disabling render operations within a specific region.</p>

<p><strong><code>0x07</code> (Rectangle):</strong> Up to 16 rectangles with size and position represented as a 32-bit value. (low 16 bits are X, high 16 bits are Y)</p>

<p><strong><code>0x08</code> (Point):</strong> An arbitrary point on the screen. Depending on the methods used to submit the object, this object can take the form of:</p>

<p><strong><code>0x0B</code> (Triangle):</strong> A basic (presumably pre-transformed?) 2D triangle. Depending on the methods used to submit the object, this object can take the form of:</p>

  <li>A part of a mesh of up to 16 triangles with a 32-bit colour and two 32-bit position values for each of the points on the mesh.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><code>0x0C</code> (Windows 95 GDI Text Acceleration):</strong> A specialized hardware accelerator for the manner by which Windows 95’s GDI (and its DIB Engine?) renders text. This is a very complicated set of clipping logic that won’t be covered until Part 3; it’s too long for this part, and I don’t fully understand it yet.</p>

<p><strong><code>0x0D</code> (Memory to memory format):</strong> Changes the format of a set of pixels in VRAM. Allows for changing the line (vertical size) length, count and pitch of the image.</p>

<p><strong><code>0x0E</code> (Scaled image from memory):</strong> Obtains an image from VRAM (in YUV or RGB format) and scales it before displaying it to the screen, performing a bit of differentiation to achieve this. Parameters an output position and size for the final screen as well as an input position or size.</p>

<p><strong><code>0x10</code> (Blit):</strong> Blits an image (a final one made up of 3D polygons or a 2D one) between two different parts of the screen. Has an input and output position and a size.</p>

<p><strong><code>0x11</code> (Image from CPU):</strong> Takes an image from “CPU” (main memory?), optionally scales it, and then displays it on the screen. Parameters are an input size, set of 32-bit colour values and output position and size.</p>

<p><strong><code>0x12</code> (Bitmap):</strong> Similar to <em>Image from CPU</em>, but deals with monochrome or two-colour bitmaps instead, possibly as an optimisation.</p>

<p><strong><code>0x14</code> (Transfer to Memory):</strong> Takes an image from the screen (?) and transfers it to memory. Parameters are a start position offset from VRAM and a pitch, as well as a position and size for the image.</p>

<p><strong><code>0x15</code> (Stretched image from CPU):</strong> Takes an image from “CPU” (main memory?), stretches it using an optional clip region and a little bit of differentiation, and then uses it. Parameters are an input size and a clip region using the same 16-bit coordinate format used by the basic primitive drawing silicon.</p>

<p><strong><code>0x17</code> (Direct3D 5.0 accelerated triangle with zeta buffer):</strong> Seemingly an attempt to implement the Direct3D 5.0 specification to the letter in silicon. Allows for up to 128 triangles to be submitted at a time, with six coordinates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The traditional X, Y and Z coordinates used for representing vector values in 3D space</li>
  <li>U and V coordinates for textures. Textures may be <em>uploaded</em> at sizes up to 2048x2048 (only power of two textures are allowed!), but are scaled down to 256x256 during upload, if they are larger.</li>
  <li>An “M” coordinate, apparently a “measurement dimension” used for more precise measurement of real-world distances</li>
</ul>

<p>Each triangle may have a 32-bit colour value as well. Note that the RIVA 128 is not a multitexture-capable GPU; you can only apply one texture to each batch of 128 triangles, so the implementation of Direct3D in the drivers should attempt to send as many triangles with the same texture to the GPU as the GPU can fit, as closely as possible. If you write applications targeting this GPU, you should try ensuring objects with the same texture add up to close to a multiple of 128 triangles, as the D3D driver’s implementation of this optimisation will improve the efficiency of your renderer.</p>

<p>These triangles, as a group, may have the following effects applied to them:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“Zeta buffer” (may be similar to the Z-buffer used for polygon ordering, or for mipmapping?)</li>
  <li>“Alpha buffer” (probably for alpha blending)</li>
  <li>Specular highlighting</li>
  <li>Vertex fog (of any 32-bit colour)</li>
  <li>Interpolation between vertex positions (using a zero-order hold, “Microsoft” variant of zero-order hold, or full-order hold implementation)</li>
  <li>Frustum culling clockwise or counterclockwise (discarding triangles, although presumably this would only work in the batch of 128 triangles sent to the hardware for processing)</li>
  <li>Texture UV coordinate wrapping for seamless textures (coordinates can wrap cleanly, be clamped to their “last” pixels or mirror themselves)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><code>0x18</code> (Point with zeta buffer):</strong> Similar to <em>Point</em>, but the zeta and alpha buffer can be applied to it too.</p>

<h4 id="when-you-screw-up-ramro">When you screw up: RAMRO</h4>

<p>Aside from the previously-covered <code>RAMFC</code> and <code>RAMAU</code>, another important structure is stored in <code>RAMIN</code>. <code>RAMRO</code> saves the day and prevents the GPU from blowing up if a graphics object you submit is invalid, because after all, nothing is perfect and there are always bugs in code.</p>

<p>During object submission, if the GPU detects that the cache ran out, was turned off, or any kind of illegal access was performed, the submission is not processed; instead, it is sent to a special area of <code>RAMIN</code> known as <code>RAMRO</code> (always half the size of <code>RAMHT</code>), which stores the object, what went wrong, and whether a read or write operation was involved in the error. Additionally, an interrupt is fired so that any drivers running on the system can catch the error and (hopefully) correct it.</p>

<p>The <code>PFIFO_RUNOUT_STATUS</code> register holds the current state of the <code>RAMRO</code> region, including whether or not any errors have occurred.</p>

<h4 id="ramau">RAMAU</h4>

<p><code>RAMAU</code> was an area used on the NV1 and revision A NV3 chips for storing audio data being streamed into the CPU. On Revision B and later cards, this area is still mapped to MMIO space, but its functionality has been removed entirely.</p>

<h3 id="interrupts-20-notifiers">Interrupts 2.0: Notifiers</h3>

<p>Some people at NVIDIA decided that they were too cool for interrupts and thought: why have an interrupt that tells the GPU to do something, when you could have an interrupt that has the GPU tell the drivers to do something? And thus the incredible <em>notifier</em> system was born.</p>

<p>Notifiers appear to have been implemented to allow the drivers to manage GPU resources implemented in software instead of silicon. Every single subsystem in the GPU has a notifier enable register alongside its interrupt enable register, with some having multiple enable registers for different notifier types; notifiers are mostly found within <code>PGRAPH</code>, <code>PME</code> and <code>PVIDEO</code>, but may also exist in other subsystems.</p>

<p><code>PGRAPH</code> notifiers appear to be intended to work with the object class system, and actually differ - there is basically one “type” of notification depending on the object class, with each object having a set of “notification parameters” that can be used to trigger the <code>SetNotify</code> method at <code>0x104</code> within an object stored in <code>RAMHT</code>. There is also the <code>SetNotifyCtxDma</code> method, usually but not always at <code>0x0</code>, which is used for context switching. Notifiers appear to be “requested” until the GPU processes them, and <code>PGRAPH</code> can take up to 16 software and 1 hardware notifier type. Objects are signalled to the driver by directly DMAing into the Resource Manager memory. Notifications are represented by a structure as such:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>uint32_t</span> <span>nanoseconds</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>];</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>TimeStamp</span><span>;</span>
    <span>int32_t</span> <span>info32</span><span>;</span>
    <span>int16_t</span> <span>info16</span><span>;</span>
    <span>int16_t</span> <span>status</span><span>;</span> <span>/* 0xFF (NV_NOTIFICATION_IN_PROGRESS) = pending; 0x00 = complete; others = error */</span>
<span>}</span> <span>NvNotification</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>More research is ongoing. It appears that most notifiers are generated by the driver in order to manage hardware resources that they would not otherwise be capable of managing, such as the <code>PFIFO</code> caches.</p>

<h3 id="pramdac">PRAMDAC</h3>

<p>The final part of the GPU that handles the intricacies of generating a video signal, sets the resolution, and holds a color lookup table for the various modes.</p>

<p>I haven’t looked into this part as much, so expect more information in an update on this part or in future parts of this series. It’s not really super critical to emulate anyway, outside of the <a href="#clocks">clock control portion</a>, as the actual analog video generation part mostly does not apply to emulation.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="next-part">Next part</h2>

<p>The next part will dive into how NVIDIA’s drivers work and how they make this ridiculously complicated mess of an architecture transform itself into a GPU that allows you to run games you may actually want to play. Stay tuned!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://cketti.de/2025/02/26/goodbye-k9mail/">https://cketti.de/2025/02/26/goodbye-k9mail/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43196436">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I quit my job working on <a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/mobile/">Thunderbird for Android</a> and <a href="https://k9mail.app/">K-9 Mail</a> at MZLA.</p>

<p>My personal journey with K-9 Mail started in late 2009, shortly after getting my first Android device<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. The pre-installed Email app didn’t work very well with my email provider. When looking for alternatives, I discovered K-9 Mail. It had many of the same issues<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. But it was an active open source project that accepted contributions. I started fixing the problems I was experiencing and contributed these changes to K-9 Mail. It was a very pleasant experience and so I started fixing bugs reported by other users.</p>

<p>In February 2010, <a href="https://metasocial.com/@jesse">Jesse Vincent</a>, the founder of the K-9 Mail project, offered me commit access to the Subversion<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> repository. According to my email archive, I replied with the following text:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thank you! I really enjoyed writing patches for K-9 and gladly accept your offer. But I probably won’t be able to devote as much time to the project as I do right now for a very long time. I hope that’s not a big problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My prediction turned out to be not quite accurate. I was able to spend a lot of time working on K-9 Mail and quickly became one of the most active contributors.</p>

<p>In 2012, Jesse hired me to work on <a href="https://kaitenmail.com/">Kaiten Mail</a>, a commercial closed-source fork of K-9 Mail. The only real differences between the apps were moderate changes to the user interface. So most of the features and bug fixes we created for Kaiten Mail also went into K-9 Mail. This was important to me and one of the reasons I took the job.</p>

<p>In early 2014, Jesse made me the <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/k-9-mail/c/6OzXyOoksf8/m/xrbvkd1xO8AJ">K-9 Mail project leader</a><sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. With Kaiten Mail, end-user support was eating up a lot of time and eventually motivation to work on the app. So we stopped working on it around the same time and the app slowly faded away.</p>

<p>To pay the bills, I started working as a freelancing Android developer<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>. Maybe not surprisingly, more often than not I was contracted to work on email clients. Whenever I was working on a closed source fork of K-9 Mail<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>, I had a discounted hourly rate that would apply when working on things that were contributed to K-9 Mail. This was mostly bug fixes, but also the odd feature every now and then.</p>

<p>After a contract ended in 2019, I decided to apply for a grant from the <a href="https://prototypefund.de/">Prototype Fund</a> to work on adding JMAP support to K-9 Mail<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>. This allowed me to basically work full-time on the project. When the funding period ended in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic was in full swing. At that time I didn’t feel like looking for a new contract. I filled my days working on K-9 Mail to mute the feeling of despair about the world. I summarized my 2020 in the blog post <a href="https://cketti.de/2021/01/14/my-first-year-as-a-full-time-open-source-developer/">My first year as a full-time open source developer</a>.</p>

<p>Eventually I had to figure out how to finance this full-time open source developer lifestyle. I ended up <a href="https://k9mail.app/2021/02/14/K-9-Mail-is-looking-for-funding">asking</a> K-9 Mail users to donate so I could be paid to dedicate 80% of my time to work on the app. This worked out quite nicely and I wrote about it here: <a href="https://k9mail.app/2022/01/18/2021-in-Review">2021 in Review</a>.</p>

<p>I first learned about plans to create a Thunderbird version for Android in late 2019. I was approached because one of the options considered was basing Thunderbird for Android on K-9 Mail. At the time, I wasn’t really interested in working on Thunderbird for Android. But I was more than happy to help turn the K-9 Mail code base into something that Thunderbird could use as a base for their own app. However, it seemed the times where we had availability to work on such a project never aligned. And so nothing concrete happened. But we stayed in contact.</p>

<p>In December 2021, it seemed to have become a priority to find a solution for the many Thunderbird users asking for an Android app. By that time, I had realized that funding an open source project via donations requires an ongoing fundraising effort. Thunderbird was already doing this for quite some time and getting pretty good at it. I, on the other hand, was not looking forward to the idea of getting better at fundraising.<br>
So, when I was asked again whether I was interested in K-9 Mail and myself joining the Thunderbird project, I said yes. It took another six months for us to figure out the details and <a href="https://k9mail.app/2022/06/13/K-9-Mail-and-Thunderbird">announce</a> the news to the public.</p>

<p>Once under the Thunderbird umbrella, we worked<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> on adding features to K-9 Mail that we wanted an initial version of Thunderbird for Android to have. The mobile team slowly grew to include another <a href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/2023/03/thunderbird-for-android-k-9-mail-february-progress-report/">Android developer</a>, then a <a href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/2024/07/thunderbird-for-android-k-9-mail-june-2024-progress-report/">manager</a>. While organizationally the design team was its own group, there was always at least one designer available to work with the mobile team on the Android app. And then there were a bunch of other teams to do the things for which you don’t need Android engineers: support, communication, donations, etc.</p>

<p>In October 2024, we finally released the <a href="https://blog.thunderbird.net/2024/10/thunderbird-for-android-8-0-takes-flight/">first version of Thunderbird for Android</a>. The months leading up to the release were quite stressful for me. All of us were working on many things at the same time to not let the targeted release date slip too much. We never worked overtime, though. And we got additional paid time off after the release ❤️</p>

<p>After a long vacation, we started 2025 with a more comfortable pace. However, the usual joy I felt when working on the app, didn’t return. I finally realized this at the beginning of February, while being sick in bed and having nothing better to do than contemplating life.<br>
I don’t think I was close to a burnout – work wasn’t that much fun anymore, but it was far from being unbearable. I’ve been there before. And in the past it never was a problem to step away from K-9 Mail for a few months. However, it’s different when it’s your job. But since I am in the very fortunate position of being able to afford taking a couple of months off, I decided to do just that. So the question was whether to take a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbatical">sabbatical</a> or to quit.<br>
Realistically, permanently walking away from K-9 Mail never was an option in the past. There was no one else to take over as a maintainer. It would have most likely meant the end of the project. K-9 Mail was always too important to me to let that happen.<br>
But this is no longer an issue. There’s now a whole team behind the project and me stepping away no longer is an existential threat to the app.</p>

<p>I want to explore what it feels like to do something else without going back to the project being a foregone conclusion. That is why I quit my job at MZLA.</p>

<p>It was a great job and I had awesome coworkers. I can totally recommend <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/careers/listings/?team=MZLA/Thunderbird">working</a> with these people and will miss doing so 😢</p>

<hr>

<p>I have no idea what I’ll end up doing next. A coworker asked me whether I’ll stick to writing software or do something else entirely. I was quite surprised by this question. Both because in hindsight it felt like an obvious question to ask and because I’ve never even considered doing something else. I guess that means I’m very much still a software person and will be for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>During my vacation I very much enjoyed being a beginner and learning about technology I haven’t worked with as a developer before (NFC smartcards, USB HID, Bluetooth LE). So I will probably start a lot of personal projects and finish few to none of them 😃</p>

<p>I think there’s a good chance that – after an appropriately sized break – I will return as a volunteer contributor to K-9 Mail/Thunderbird for Android.</p>

<p>But for now, I say: <strong>Goodbye K-9 Mail</strong> 👋</p>

<hr>

<p>This leaves me with saying thank you to everyone who contributed to K-9 Mail and Thunderbird for Android over the years. People wrote code, translated the app, reported bugs, helped other users, gave money, promoted the app, and much more. Thank you all 🙏</p>

                A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to turn your device—whether it’s a desktop, smartphone,
                or smartwatch—into an AirTag-like tracker, enabling the attacker to track your location.
                How does it work? Over 1.5 billion iPhones could act as free tracking agents for the attacker worldwide.

                <p>
                        Apple’s Find My network, leveraging over a billion active Apple devices, is the world’s largest
                        device-locating network.
                        We investigate the potential misuse of this network to maliciously track Bluetooth devices. We
                        present <em>nRootTag</em>,
                        a novel attack method that transforms computers into trackable “AirTags” without requiring root
                        privileges.
                        The attack achieves a success rate of over 90% within minutes at a cost of only a few US
                        dollars.
                        Or, a rainbow table can be built to search keys instantly.
                        Subsequently, it can locate a computer in minutes, posing a substantial risk to user privacy and
                        safety.
                        The attack is effective on Linux, Windows, and Android systems, and can be employed to track
                        desktops, laptops,
                        smartphones, and IoT devices.
                        Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates nRootTag’s effectiveness and efficiency across various
                        scenarios.

                    <h2>Overview of Find My Offline Finding</h2>
                    <p>
                        <img src="https://nroottag.github.io/static/images/findmy_overview.jpg" alt="Overview">

                    <p>
                        Figure illustrates the overview of Find My offline finding.
                        (1) Through pairing, an AirTag shares the public / private key
                        information with the owner’s device. (2) When the AirTag is
                        separated from the paired device, it advertises its public key
                        via BLE advertisements, known as lost messages. (3) Nearby
                        Apple devices, referred to as finders, generate encrypted lo
                        cation reports and send them, along with the hashed public
                        key, to the Apple Cloud. (4) The Apple Cloud allows anyone
                        to use a hashed public key to retrieve the associated location
                        reports, which can only be decrypted using the correct private
                        key. To ensure anonymity, finders do not authenticate whether
                        a lost message is sent from an Apple device.

                    <h2>Architecture of nRootTag</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            <img src="https://nroottag.github.io/static/images/architecture.webp" alt="Sizes of model trees">

                        <p>
                            Figure illustrates the architecture of our design.
                            (1) The Trojan code runs on the computer to be tracked. It retrieves the
                            advertising address, acquires the matching public key from our server, and then advertises
                            lost messages.
                            (2) The Server processes requests for acquiring public keys through rainbow table
                            lookup or online key search.
                            (3) The Database system, which contains a rainbow table of key information,
                            provides the corresponding public/private key pair for a given advertising address.
                            (4) The Key Generation and Search serves two purposes: it is used to precompute the
                            rainbow table,
                            and invoked to search for a matching public/private key pair on the fly.
                            Finally, given a public key, the server uses its hash value to query the Apple Cloud for
                            location reports, then decrypts the reports using the private key.

                        Our study examined several consumer-grade GPUs, such as the RTX 3070, RTX 3080, and RTX 4090,
                        as well as data center-grade GPUs, the A100 (80GB) and H100 (80GB).

                        Although the H100 achieves the highest key generation speed, its prohibitively high cost makes
                        the RTX 3080 a more economical option for performance.

<p>Nigerian entrepreneur Fara Ashiru built her fintech platform, Okra, on Amazon Web Services in 2020. She would pay AWS in dollars even as Okra earned in naira because American cloud providers did not accept payments in local currency at the time.</p>


<figure><blockquote><p><span>The bills were staggering. … This model was unsustainable.</span></p></blockquote></figure>


<p>The payments to AWS gradually skyrocketed as the naira depreciated around 70% against the dollar between 2020 and 2024. “The bills were staggering,” Ashiru told <em>Rest of World</em>. “Combine that with Nigeria’s economic challenges — rising inflation and forex volatility — and it became clear that this model was unsustainable.”</p>



<p>Ashiru took things into her own hands, and Okra set up cloud infrastructure with servers in data centers in Nigeria and South Africa in 2024. Later that year, the cloud operations were spun off into a new company called Nebula, which allows anyone in Nigeria to run their website, app, or workflow on its cloud and pay in naira.</p>



<p>Nebula is the latest entrant in the Nigerian cloud services market, where several homegrown companies — such as Nobus, Galaxy, Suburban, and Layer3 — are positioning themselves as an affordable and localized alternative to AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. <em>Rest of World </em>spoke to five startups who have migrated to local cloud providers in the last two years.</p>



<p>Besides the option to pay in naira, these companies allow Nigerians to store their data within the country — an advantage most of their Western rivals lack. Local servers give businesses the benefits of low latency and data localization at a time when the debate about who has access to a country’s data is heating up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Global leaders appear to have noticed the threat. In January, AWS started accepting payments in naira. “Local currencies are important in localizing the payment experience for customers,” <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/01/aws-payments-new-local-currencies/">AWS said</a> at the time.</p>



<p>“I think AWS has realized that they must accept naira because if you don’t accept naira you are wasting your time,” Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, managing partner at pan-African venture building firm <a href="https://acceler8.africa/">Accelerate Africa</a>, told <em>Rest of World</em>. “We regularly advise our portfolio companies to look out for local solutions where possible and manage major costs like [cloud] in naira.”</p>



<p>AWS, Microsoft, and Google did not respond to requests for comment for this story.</p>



<p>Nigeria is home to over <a href="https://tracxn.com/d/geographies/nigeria/__aRcH8lYOC74CSa9mr7vgyDsrJwlraqmlU3-gQ9qUxb0">19,000 tech startups</a>, including 1,400 venture-funded ones that have collectively raised nearly $28 billion. The country has at least three internet unicorns: e-commerce major Flutterwave and fintech firms OPay and Interswitch.</p>



<p>AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud <a href="https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/huge-cloud-market-is-still-growing-at-34-per-year-amazon-microsoft-and-google-now-account-for-65-of-all-cloud-revenues">account for nearly 65%</a> of the world’s cloud services market. They have also been the leaders in the African cloud market — their data centers, however, have so far been concentrated in South Africa.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Microsoft set up a data center in Johannesburg in 2019 and plans to build another one in South Africa and one <a href="https://acceler8.africa/">in Kenya</a>. AWS opened its first African data center in South Africa in 2020, while Google Cloud recently joined its peers by setting up a facility in Johannesburg. None of these companies have a data center in Nigeria, except the small <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/features/">local zone center</a> AWS opened in Lagos in 2023.</p>



<p>In the wake of the U.S.-China tech decoupling, there has been a growing concern about how and where data is stored. Each country is finding ways to store the data of its citizens and businesses locally. Moving to a local cloud vendor allows Nigerian startups data sovereignty, Bruce Ayonote, founder and CEO of Abuja-based cloud service provider Suburban Cloud, told <em>Rest of World</em>.</p>


<figure><blockquote><p><span>&nbsp;“We are keying into our data sovereignty narrative.”</span></p></blockquote></figure>


<p>“How does it sound for Nigerian voters’ data to be stored in Europe?” Ayonote said. “As long as we continue to ask this question, we will always arrive at the point where we build our own cloud infrastructure.”</p>



<p>Digital sovereignty could be the differentiator that helps smaller cloud Nigerian startups thrive even as AWS starts accepting payments in naira. “We are keying into our data sovereignty narrative,” Chidi Okpala, head of media and corporate communications at Galaxy Backbone, told <em>Rest of World</em>. Galaxy Backbone is a privately held company established by the Nigerian government to build interoperability among its ministries. It has now grown into providing core cloud services to both government agencies and private companies. The company runs two data centers, one each in Abuja and Kano.</p>



<p>Ayonote said that storing data on local servers also helps mitigate latency — the delay that happens when a user takes an action and when they get a response. Suburban Cloud’s Abuja data center helps its customers like Netflix and Google reduce latency in Nigeria, he added.</p>



<p>“Latency is a big issue when it comes to cloud business and these global companies know that they have to build some forms of proximity to their users,” Ayonote said.</p>



<p>While setting up a data center can <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/data-center/">cost millions of dollars</a>, small Nigerian teams have found a workaround to this with “colocation” or placing their servers in data centers that allow multiple firms to share one facility, Olumide Soyombo, co-founder of Nigerian IT services and consulting firm Bluechip Technologies, told <em>Rest of World</em>. Several of the new cloud services startups have rented spaces in large data centers built by telcos, banks, and legacy IT firms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We run our cloud services out of third-party data centers in Nigeria,” Oyaje Idoko, founder of Layer3, told <em>Rest of World</em>. “We currently have three availability zones operating out of two data centers in Lagos and one in Abuja.”</p>



<p>Open Access, a leading data center company in Africa, has seen an uptick in demand for “colocation and other services by local cloud providers, driven by the growing digital technology landscape, increasing demand and most importantly, the need for payment in local currency,” Obinna Adumike, the company’s head of converged digital infrastructure for Africa, told <em>Rest of World.</em></p>



<p>Nigerian cloud providers, however, need to improve their infrastructure and build better interfaces to compete with global giants in the long run, Ugochukwu Okoro, founder and CEO of Lagos-based property technology company <a href="https://muster.africa/">Muster</a>, told <em>Rest of World</em>.</p>



<p>Muster migrated from AWS to a small, local cloud provider called GigaLayer last August. While he has been enjoying working with GigaLayer, Okoro said, the company doesn’t offer the kind of automation that AWS does.“Their services are great, but I understand a lot of users might not want to use them because of skill issues,” he said. “I have to manually integrate our system gradually, something most of my engineers can’t do because they are used to the seamless plug-and-play offered by AWS.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the last decade, we’ve seen great advancements in distributed systems, but the way we program them has seen few fundamental improvements. While we can sometimes abstract away distribution (Spark, Redis, etc.), developers still struggle with challenges like concurrency, fault tolerance, and versioning.</p>
<p>There are lots of people (and startups) working on this. But nearly all focus on tooling to help analyze distributed systems written in classic (sequential) programming languages. Tools like <a href="https://jepsen.io/">Jepsen</a> and <a href="https://antithesis.com/">Antithesis</a> have advanced the state-of-the-art for verifying correctness and fault tolerance, but tooling is no match for programming models that natively surface fundamental concepts. We’ve already seen this with Rust, which provides memory safety guarantees that are far richer than C++ with AddressSanitizer.</p>
<p>If you look online, there are tons of frameworks for writing distributed code. In this blog post, I’ll make the case that they only offer band-aids and sugar over three fixed underlying paradigms: <strong>external-distribution</strong>, <strong>static-location</strong>, and <strong>arbitrary-location</strong>. We’re still missing a programming model that is <em>native</em> to distributed systems. We’ll walk through these paradigms then reflect on what’s missing for a truly distributed programming model.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>External-distribution</strong> architectures are what the vast majority of “distributed” systems look like. In this model, software is written as <em>sequential logic</em> that runs against a state management system with <em>sequential semantics</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stateless Services with a Distributed Database (Aurora DSQL, Cockroach)</li>
<li>Services using gossiped CRDT state (Ditto, ElectricSQL, Redis Enterprise)<sup>1</sup>1<span>1<!-- -->. <!-- -->This may come as a surprise. CRDTs are often marketed as a silver bullet for all distributed systems, but another perspective is they simply <a href="https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol16/p856-power.pdf">accelerate distributed transactions</a>. Software running over CRDTs is still sequential. <a href="#user-content-fnref-this%20may%20come%20as%20a%20surprise.%20crdts%20are%20often%20marketed%20as%20a%20silver%20bullet%20for%20all%20distributed%20systems,%20but%20another%20perspective%20is%20they%20simply%20accelerate%20distributed%20transactions.%20software%20running%20over%20crdts%20is%20still%20sequential." data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 1">↩</a></span><span><span>This may come as a surprise.

<li>Workflows and Step Functions</li>
</ul>
<p>These architectures are easy to write software in, because none of the underlying distribution is exposed<sup>2</sup>2<span>2<!-- -->. <!-- -->Well that’s the idea, at least. Serializability typically isn’t the default (<a href="https://jepsen.io/consistency/models/snapshot-isolation">snapshot isolation</a> is), so concurrency bugs can sometimes be exposed. <a href="#user-content-fnref-well%20that%E2%80%99s%20the%20idea,%20at%20least.%20serializability%20typically%20isn%E2%80%99t%20the%20default%20(snapshot%20isolation%20is),%20so%20concurrency%20bugs%20can%20sometimes%20be%20exposed." data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 2">↩</a></span><span><span>Well that’s the idea, at least.

Although this architecture results in a distributed <em>system</em>, we do not have a distributed <em>programming model</em>.</p>
<p>There is little need to reason about fault-tolerance or concurrency bugs (other than making sure to opt into the right consistency levels for CRDTs). So it’s clear why developers opt for this option, since it hides the distributed chaos under a clean, sequential semantics. But this comes at a clear cost: performance and scalability.</p>
<p>Serializing everything is tantamount to <em>emulating</em> a non-distributed system, but with expensive coordination protocols. The database forms a single point of failure in your system; you either hope that us-east-1 doesn’t go down or switch to a multi-writer system like Cockroach that comes with its own performance implications. Many applications are at sufficiently low scale to tolerate this, but you wouldn’t want to <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/netflixs-distributed-counter-abstraction-8d0c45eb66b2">implement a counter</a> like this.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Static-location</strong> architectures are the classic way to write distributed code. You compose several units—each written as <em>local (single-machine)</em> code that communicates with other machines using asynchronous network calls:</p>
<ul>
<li>Services communicating with API calls, possibly using async / await (gRPC, REST)</li>
<li>Actors (Akka, Ray, Orleans)</li>

</ul>
<p>These architectures give us full, low-level control. We’re writing a bunch of sequential, single-machine software with network calls. This is great for performance and fault-tolerance because we control what gets run where and when.</p>
<p>But the boundaries between networked units are <strong>rigid and opaque</strong>. Developers must make one-way decisions on how to break up their application. These decisions have a wide impact on correctness; retries and message ordering are controlled by the sender and unknown to the recipient. Furthermore, the language and tooling have limited insight into how units are composed. Jump-to-definition is often unavailable, and serialization mismatches across services can easily creep in.</p>
<p>Most importantly, this approach to distributed systems fundamentally eliminates <strong>semantic co-location and modularity.</strong> In sequential code, things that happen one after the other are <em>textually placed</em> one after the other and function calls encapsulate <em>entire algorithms</em>. But with static-location architectures, developers are coerced to modularize code on machine boundaries, rather than on semantic boundaries. In these architectures there is simply no way to encapsulate a distributed algorithm as a single, unified semantic unit.</p>
<p>Although static-location architectures offer developers the most low-level control over their system, in practice they are difficult to implement robustly without distributed systems expertise. There is a fundamental mismatch between <em>implementation</em> and <em>execution</em>: static-location software is written as single-machine code, but the correctness of the system requires reasoning about the fleet of machines as a whole. Teams building such systems often live in fear of concurrency bugs and failures, leading to mountains of legacy code that are too critical to touch.</p>

<p><strong>Arbitrary-location</strong> architectures are the foundation of most “modern” approaches to distributed systems. These architectures simplify distributed systems by letting to write code as if it were running on a single machine, but at runtime the software is <em>dynamically</em> executed <em>across several machines</em><sup>3</sup>3<span>3<!-- -->. <!-- -->Actor frameworks don’t <em>really</em> count even if they support migration, since the developer still has to explicitly define the boundaries of an actor and specify where message passing happens <a href="#user-content-fnref-actor%20frameworks%20don%E2%80%99t%20really%20count%20even%20if%20they%20support%20migration,%20since%20the%20developer%20still%20has%20to%20explicitly%20define%20the%20boundaries%20of%20an%20actor%20and%20specify%20where%20message%20passing%20happens" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 3">↩</a></span><span><span>Actor frameworks don’t <em>really</em> count even if they support migration, since the developer still has to explicitly define the boundaries of an actor and specify where message passing happens <a href="#user-content-fnref-actor%20frameworks%20don%E2%80%99t%20really%20count%20even%20if%20they%20support%20migration,%20since%20the%20developer%20still%20has%20to%20explicitly%20define%20the%20boundaries%20of%20an%20actor%20and%20specify%20where%20message%20passing%20happens" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 3">↩</a></span></span><strong>:</strong></p>

<li>MapReduce Frameworks (Hadoop, Spark)</li>

<li>Durable Execution (Temporal, DBOS, Azure Durable Functions)</li>
</ul>
<p>These architectures elegantly handle the co-location problem since there are no explicit network boundaries in the language/API to split your code across. But this simplicity comes at a significant cost: <strong>control</strong>. By letting the runtime decide how the code is distributed, we lose the ability to make decisions about how the application is scaled, where the fault domains lie, and when data is sent over the network.</p>
<p>Just like the external-distribution model, arbitrary-location architectures often come with a performance cost. Durable execution systems typically snapshot their state to a persistent store between every step<sup>4</sup>4<span>4<!-- -->. <!-- -->With some optimizations when a step is a pure, deterministic function <a href="#user-content-fnref-with%20some%20optimizations%20when%20a%20step%20is%20a%20pure,%20deterministic%20function" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 4">↩</a></span><span><span>With some optimizations when a step is a pure, deterministic function <a href="#user-content-fnref-with%20some%20optimizations%20when%20a%20step%20is%20a%20pure,%20deterministic%20function" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 4">↩</a></span></span>. Stream processing systems may dynamically persist data and are free to introduce asynchrony across steps. SQL users are at the mercy of the query optimizer, to which they at best can only give “hints” on distribution decisions.</p>
<p>We often need low-level control over where individual logic is placed for performance and correctness. Consider implementing Two-Phase Commit. This protocol has explicit, asymmetric roles for a leader that broadcasts proposals and workers that acknowledge them. To correctly implement such a protocol, we need to explicitly assign specific logic to these roles, since quorums must be determined on a single leader and each worker must atomically decide to accept or reject a proposal. It’s simply not possible to implement such a protocol in an arbitrary-location architecture without introducing unnecessary networking and coordination overhead.</p>
<h2>Obligatory LLM Section</h2>
<p>If you’ve been following the “agentic” LLM space, you might be wondering: “Are any of these issues relevant in a world where my software is being written by an LLM?” If the static-location model is sufficiently rich to express all distributed systems, who cares if it’s painful to program in!</p>
<p>I’d argue that LLMs actually are a great argument why we <em>need</em> a new programming model. These models famously struggle under scenarios where contextually-relevant information is scattered across large bodies of text<sup>5</sup>5<span>5<!-- -->. <!-- -->See the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/the-needle-in-the-haystack-test-and-how-gemini-pro-solves-it">Needle in a Haystack Test</a>; reasoning about distributed systems is even harder. <a href="#user-content-fnref-see%20the%20needle%20in%20a%20haystack%20test;%20reasoning%20about%20distributed%20systems%20is%20even%20harder." data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 5">↩</a></span><span><span>See the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/the-needle-in-the-haystack-test-and-how-gemini-pro-solves-it">Needle in a Haystack Test</a>; reasoning about distributed systems is even harder. <a href="#user-content-fnref-see%20the%20needle%20in%20a%20haystack%20test;%20reasoning%20about%20distributed%20systems%20is%20even%20harder." data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 5">↩</a></span></span>. LLMs do best when semantically-relevant information is co-located.</p>
<p>The static-location model forces us to split up our semantically-connected distributed logic across several modules. LLMs aren’t great yet at correctness on a single machine; it is well beyond their abilities to compose several single-machine programs that work together correctly. Furthermore, LLMs make decisions sequentially; splitting up distributed logic across several networked modules is inherently challenging to the very structure of AI models.</p>
<p>LLMs would do far better with a programming model that retains “semantic locality”. In a hypothetical programming model where code that spans several machines can be co-located, this problem becomes trivial. All the relevant logic for a distributed algorithm would be right next to each other, and the LLM can generate distributed logic in a straight-line manner.</p>
<p>The other piece of the puzzle is correctness. LLMs make mistakes, and our best bet is to combine them with tools that can automatically discover them<sup>6</sup>6<span>6<!-- -->. <!-- -->Lean is a great example of this in action.

Sequential models have no way to reason about the ways distributed execution might cause trouble. But a sufficiently rich distributed programming model could surface issues arising from network delays and faults (think a borrow-checker, but for distributed systems).</p>
<h2>What can we take from these systems?</h2>
<p>Although the programming models we’ve discussed each have several limitations, they also demonstrate desirable features that a native programming model for distributed systems should support. What can we learn from each model?</p>
<p>I’m going to skip over external-distribution, which as we discussed is not quite distributed. For applications that can tolerate the performance and semantic restrictions of this model, this is the way to go. But for a general distributed programming model, we can’t keep networking and concurrency hidden from the developer.</p>
<p>The static-location model seems like the right place to start, since it is at least capable of <em>expressing</em> all the types of distributed systems we might want to implement, even if the programming model offers us little help in <em>reasoning</em> about the distribution. We were missing two things that the arbitrary-location model offered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing logic that spans several machines right next to each other, in a single function</li>
<li>Surfacing semantic information on distributed behavior such as message reordering, retries, and serialization formats across network boundaries</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these points have a dual, something we don’t want to give up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explicit control over placement of logic on machines, with the ability to perform local, atomic computations</li>
<li>Rich options for fault tolerance guarantees and network semantics, without the language locking us into global coordination and recovery protocols</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s time for a <em>native</em> programming model—a Rust-for-distributed systems, if you will—that addresses all of these.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="This $100 Muon Detector Lets You Harness the Cosmos"><p>In the mid-1960s, the Nobel Prize–winning physicist Luis Alvarez had a wild idea. He proposed using <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/muons">muons</a>, highly penetrating subatomic particles created when <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cosmic-rays">cosmic rays</a> strike Earth’s atmosphere, to search for hidden chambers within one of the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/pyramids">pyramids</a> of Giza.</p><p>These muon particles are heavyweight cousins of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/electrons">electrons</a> that travel close to the speed of light. They can penetrate through many meters of solid rock, including the limestone and granite blocks used to build the pyramids. But some of the muons will be absorbed by this dense material, meaning that they can be used to essentially “X-ray” a pyramid, revealing its inner structure. So in 1968, Alvarez and his colleagues began making muon measurements from a chamber located at the base of the Pyramid of Khafre.</p><p>They didn’t find a hidden chamber, but they did confirm the feasibility of what has come to be called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muon_tomography" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">muon tomography</a>. Physicists have since used the technique to discover <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.023017" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hidden access shafts above tunnels</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms4381" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study magma chambers within volcanos</a>, and even <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/harnessing-cosmic-rays-to-peer-into-fukushimas-deadly-reactors" target="_self">probe the damaged reactors at Fukushima</a>. And, in 2017, muon measurements finally <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/muon-imaging-finds-hidden-chamber-in-great-pyramid-of-giza" target="_self">revealed a hidden chamber in one of the pyramids of Giza</a>—just not the pyramid that Alvarez had chosen to explore.</p><p>You too can perform similar experiments with equipment that you can build yourself for only US $100 or so.</p><p>While some well-documented designs are available for low-cost muon detectors (in particular, the <a href="http://cosmicwatch.lns.mit.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cosmic Watch</a> project from <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/mit">MIT</a>), I decided to pursue a simpler—and slightly cheaper—approach. I purchased two <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B45WCBRM/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Geiger-counter kits</a>, each costing only $23. Although it’s called a “kit,” this board in fact comes fully assembled minus the key component: a Geiger-Müller (or <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/gm">GM</a>) tube for detecting ionizing <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/radiation">radiation</a>. It also comes with no documentation.</p><p>The lack of documentation wasn’t a problem once I found <a href="https://www.richardmudhar.com/blog/2023/10/cajoe-ebay-geiger-counter-kit/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a good source for information about this board</a>—including a pointer to<a href="https://master.dl.sourceforge.net/project/geigerlog/Articles/GeigerLog-Radiation-v1.1%28CAJOE%29-Support-v1.0.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> valuable instructions</a> for how to set the tube’s anode voltage.</p><p><img alt="Key components for the muon detector" data-rm-shortcode-id="6d4591bc5cef309c8117827e4543c318" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/key-components-for-the-muon-detector.png?id=56566029&amp;width=980" height="712" id="a9adf" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/key-components-for-the-muon-detector.png?id=56566029&amp;width=980" width="1289"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">The muon detector uses two Geiger-Müller tubes [top], each inserted into a sensor board [bottom right].

Many of these are listed on <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ebay">eBay</a> by sellers in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ukraine">Ukraine</a>, but I was able to obtain a pair of such tubes from a supplier in the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/united-states">United States</a> for just <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/225741720104" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$49</a>.</p><p>“Why two kits and two tubes?” you might ask. It’s because GM tubes don’t react just to muons. Most of the time, they’re triggered by ionizing particles given off by radioactive substances in the environment, such as the daughter products of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/radon">radon</a> in the air.</p><p><span>Proving that the results reflected the flux of cosmic-ray muons wasn’t difficult.</span></p><p><span></span>To distinguish the high-energy cosmic-ray muons from the other, lower-energy particles isn’t hard, though. Just apply what physicists call the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincidence_method" target="_blank">coincidence method</a>: Detect only when two nearby tubes are triggered practically simultaneously, meaning one particle has barreled through both tubes. The two tubes in my device are separated by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B083GNJMXZ" target="_blank">25-millimeter spacers</a>, making it unlikely that a particle coming from a nearby radioactive decay would be energetic enough to pass through both tubes. I reduced the likelihood even more by placing a layer of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09WDWHK1X/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fishing-sinker lead</a> between the tubes.</p><p>To turn the stacked pair of GM counters into a coincidence detector, I hooked up the output of each board (oddly labeled VIN, which usually means a pin for a voltage supply input!) to a spare <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoNano" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Arduino Nano</a>, programmed to record a hit only when one board registers a count within 1 millisecond of the other. Naturally this means the detector can recognize only muons with trajectories roughly aligned with the plane of the GM tubes so that the muons pass through both tubes.</p><p><img alt="A diagram showing the outlines of two tubes separated by a thin layer of lead.

By registering only activations that occur almost simultaneously, we can plot the muon flux as a function of the angle from vertical of the detector, with the observed data following the predicted model closely</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">James Provost</small></p><p>Proving to myself that the results indeed reflected the flux of cosmic-ray muons wasn’t difficult: I just measured the count rate as a function of how far away from vertical my detector was oriented. You see, the flux of cosmic-ray muons coming in vertically from the sky is greater than the flux of muons traveling horizontally. Between these extremes, the flux should have a cosine-squared dependence on the angle as the detector’s plane rotates from vertical to horizontal.</p><p>So I set about counting events with my device oriented at different angles from vertical, allowing at least 12 hours for each measurement. The results were pretty consistent with the expected cosine-squared variation. For example, when completely horizontal, the detector registered a value that was less than 10 percent of that obtained when vertical, but it wasn’t zero.</p><p>Getting nonzero muon counts even when horizontal isn’t so surprising. With only a 2.5-centimeter separation between the two 1-cm-diameter tubes, my detector’s angular resolution is pretty broad (±22 degrees). So even when I set the unit to sense horizontal flux, it was surely detecting muons coming in from as much as 22 degrees above the horizon.</p><p>With a working muon detector in hand, I set off to probe the Earth—or at least a small part of it—by visiting the <a href="https://historicsites.nc.gov/all-sites/reed-gold-mine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Reed Gold Mine</a>, in Midland, N.C., the first commercial gold mine in the United States. I spent about two and a half hours in the mine, making five 30-minute measurements. I easily detected the increasingly thick layer of rock above the mine’s main horizontal tunnel.

  <p>I have cited a few games as inspiration for Balatro in the past, but I wanted to talk about one in particular that hasn’t been mentioned much that arguably is the most important.</p><p>I think if I had some kind of Balatro vision board, solitaire (Klondike) would be right in the middle of it with a big red circle around it. You can probably see some of the similarities between my game and the classic solo card game. I wanted my game to have the same vibe.</p><p>If you’re somehow unfamiliar, solitaire is a group of card games characterized by solo play. Klondike is usually the variant that most people in the west associate with solitaire, but one could argue<em> </em>even Balatro is technically a solitaire game. Traditional solitaire games exist at the peak of game culture for me. These games are so ubiquitous and accepted by society that almost everyone has some memory of playing them. They have transcended gaming culture more than even the biggest IPs (like Tetris or Mario), and they occupy this very interesting <strong><em>wholesome</em></strong> niche. Solitaire is almost viewed as a positive pastime more than a game. That feeling interests me greatly as a game designer.</p><div><p>As Balatro 1.0 development drew nearer to a close in early 2024, I found myself picturing the type of person that might play my game and what a typical play session might look like for them. My fantasy was that I was playing this weird game many years later on a lazy Sunday afternoon; I play a couple of runs, enjoy my time for about an hour, then set it down and continue the rest of my day. I wanted it to feel evergreen, comforting, and enjoyable in a very low-stakes way. I think that’s one of the reasons why there isn’t a player character, health, or classic ‘enemies’ in the game as well. I wanted this game to be as low stakes as a crossword or a sudoku puzzle while still exercising the problem solving part of the brain.</p><p>Essentially I wanted to play Balatro like people play solitaire.</p></div><p>One of the main ways that the vibe of solitaire and my own game differ is in the meta-game Balatro has that solitaire does not. Things like achievements, stake levels, unlocks, and challenges certainly can be looked at as a way to artificially inflate playtime, but those things were added for 2 other reasons I was more concerned about:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>To force players to get out of their comfort zone and explore the design of the game in a way they might not if this were a fully unguided gaming experience. In solitaire this probably isn’t super useful because the game has far fewer moving parts, so the player can figure everything out by themselves, but I don’t think that’s the case with a game like Balatro. I feel like even I learned a lot from these guiding goals that I wasn’t anticipating many months after the game launched.</p></li><li><p>To give the players that already enjoy the game loop a sort of checklist to work through if they so choose. They can come up with a list of goals on their own (as I see many from the community have) but I do really appreciate when I play other games and they give me tasks to accomplish and shape my long-form play around while I enjoy the shorter play sessions individually.<br> </p></li></ol><div><p>It’s now been over a year since launch and I am still playing Balatro almost daily. I play a couple runs before I go to bed, and I feel like I just might have accomplished the task of recreating the feeling of playing solitaire for myself. Seeing the discourse around my game has me fairly convinced that this is decidedly not how the average player has been interacting with my game, but I’m still thrilled that people are having a great time with it and I’m even more happy that I feel like this game turned out how I wanted as a player myself.</p><p> This is why you might have seen me refer to this game as ‘jazz solitaire’ in the past. I wanted to bring the old feeling of solitaire into a game with modern design bells and whistles, creating something new and yet familiar. Only time will tell if I actually accomplished that.</p></div>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.quippd.com/writing/2025/02/26/mozillas-new-terms-of-use-are-out-of-step-with-firefoxs-direct-competition.html">https://www.quippd.com/writing/2025/02/26/mozillas-new-terms-of-use-are-out-of-step-with-firefoxs-direct-competition.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43194536">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>On Wednesday, <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-news/firefox-terms-of-use/">Mozilla introduced legal updates to users of Firefox</a>, and something feels off. I read, and re-read the new <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/legal/terms/firefox/">Terms of Use</a> and while much of it reads like standard boilerplate from any tech company, there’s a new section that is unexpected:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you upload or input information through Firefox, you hereby grant us a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use that information to help you navigate, experience, and interact with online content as you indicate with your use of Firefox.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The community <a href="https://mstdn.io/@jomo/114072136787385688">has</a> <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@mttaggart/114071999359445580">also</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/1iyuvjf/introducing_a_terms_of_use_and_updated_privacy/meyb9e9/">zeroed</a> in on this phrase, with contributors <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/why-does-mozilla-now-require-a-nonexclusive-royalty-free-worldwide-license-when-entering-information-in-firefox/140700">asking directly</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqpnRyfz_aY">what up with that?</a></p>

<p>While I’m not going to ponder about <em>why</em> Mozilla wants this royalty-free license to my intellectual property, I immediately wondered whether using Microsoft Word also needed this kind of license grant – since it is <em>processing my words</em>.</p>

<p>I was quickly <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/servicesagreement">informed</a> by a chatroom interlocutor that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To the extent necessary to provide the Services to you and others, to protect you and the Services, and to improve Microsoft products and services, you grant to Microsoft a worldwide and royalty-free intellectual property license to use Your Content, for example, to make copies of, retain, transmit, reformat, display, and distribute via communication tools Your Content on the Services.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which seems excessive. However, this copy is part of a section called “Your Content” where Microsoft explicitly disclaims ownership of your content:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many of our Services allow you to create, store or share Your Content or receive material from others. <strong>We don’t claim ownership of Your Content.</strong> Your Content remains yours and you are responsible for it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that gives you the ick, or you simply want to avoid the <a href="https://beebom.com/microsoft-free-ad-supported-office-quietly-launched/">ads coming to Office</a>, you may want to try <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a> - which doesn’t seem to have a terms of service. Just local, open source software.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Microsoft specifically disclaims ownership of your content - something Mozilla does not do.</p>

<p>Is Mozilla an outlier here? Is this as weird as it seems? Mozilla has a <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/compare/">browser comparison page</a>, so we can use those as a basis for comparison - let’s look at the data!</p>

They also retain the right to use “content you’ve shared publicly to promote” their service, such as reviews, and to develop new technologies and services. You also grant these rights to sublicensees. Unsurprisingly, Google grants itself very expansive access to your intellectual property.</td>

</table>

<p>It would be remiss to not mention that these changes come at the heels of a <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-leadership-growth-planning-updates/">leadership shakeup</a> at Mozilla, with the exit of its longtime <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2014/10/getting-there-mozilla-foundations-mitchell-baker-111479">lizard wrangler, Mitchell Baker</a> and a new focus on “<a href="https://www.quippd.com/writing/2024/10/13/protecting-your-privacy-while-eroding-your-democracy-PPAs-considered-harmful.html">privacy-respecting advertising</a>” and “trustworthy, open source AI”.</p>

<p>The initial version of this post concluded that other browser vendors don’t grant themselves the same rights to users’ intellectual property that Mozilla’s new Terms does. Upon further review and discussion, I realize that the exceptions that Google grants itself for usage of people’s content are large enough to drive a truck through - they are expansive. In particular, using people’s intellectual property to serve ads based on that content is exactly the kind of usage that people are creeped out by.</p>

<p>There is something different here, though. Although Google’s ToS is expansive, Mozilla’s is more expansive still. As Google notes, “some of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive, or share your content. You have no obligation to provide any content to our services and you’re free to choose the content that you want to provide. If you choose to upload or share content, please make sure you have the necessary rights to do so and that the content is lawful.” Google grants itself the expansive rights only when users upload or share content to its online services. Mozilla goes beyond this by not limiting the scope of what is covered to what is uploaded to Mozilla services, but more expansively to all “information” input “through” Firefox - that is every website, including ones on your local area network!</p>

<p>Lastly, I think the non-existence of a copyright license grant in the other competing browsers presents a valuable counterexample to claims that users of software programs must explicitly grant copying rights to any software that interacts with user data. What is their exposure to liability?</p>

<p>Clearly, if a license grant isn’t present in the Terms, users aren’t automatically granting <em>expansive</em> rights like letting a print shop republish dozens of copies of their work for free after making a single printout. If such a grant was automatic, vendors wouldn’t need to write it into an agreement that must be clicked through. Vendors that <em>do</em> assert such rights in their Terms can expect them to be operative, as <a href="https://www.mcglinchey.com/insights/split-supreme-judicial-court-issues-important-update-to-clickwrap-arbitration-clause-jurisprudence/">“clickwrap” agreements have been held to be enforceable</a>.</p>

<h2 id="feedback">Feedback</h2>

<p>I received some valuable feedback to this post, so I have further thoughts. At the outset, I’ll note that I am not a lawyer.</p>

<h3 id="this-is-a-prudent-change---it-prevents-lawsuits">This is a prudent change - it prevents lawsuits</h3>

<p>I got feedback that while the new verbiage might not be quite <em>necessary</em>, it clarifies and prevents people and businesses from trying to sue Mozilla for using the software as designed. An example of this might be someone suing Mozilla for uploading a file that they dragged onto Firefox, transmitting the file to a third party website.</p>

<p>It is not clear to me why Mozilla needs a license grant to protect itself from this lawsuit - the software worked as designed, and Mozilla having a license to the data doesn’t indemnify it from transmitting the data to the wrong place - if anything, the indemnification clause does that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Mozilla and its affiliates harmless for any liability or claim from your use of Firefox, to the extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lacking a transferable, sub-licensable agreement means that Mozilla can’t escape liability for sending the file to the “wrong” site by granting the “wrong” site the license to the information. The lawsuits that I have come up with in my thought exercises don’t seem coherent to me. It is hard for me to imagine a lawsuit that would be prevented by this phrase.</p>

<p>My interpretation could be totally wrong! If it is, Mozilla can help the community understand why this verbiage is necessary – and what risks forks and other vendors who do not have this language in their ToS harbor. If forks are exposing themselves to legal liability, Mozilla would be performing a community service to non-Mozilla Gecko developers by clarifying their understanding of why copyright law requires users to grant these intellectual property rights to developers.</p>

<h3 id="this-is-how-software-works-the-tos-just-reflects-it">This is how software works, the ToS just reflects it</h3>

<p>Another response I’ve gotten is that computers need to copy data and transform it in order to do valuable things with your data. Thus, Mozilla needs these rights in order to correctly describe how software is working in the background.</p>

<p>This feels ahistorical, like an inversion of how we have always thought about copyright.</p>

<p>Did writing a story in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacWrite">MacWrite</a> give Claris rights to your story?</p>

<p>Remember that to display, edit, transform (underline, italicize, fonts) the documents you write in MacWrite <em>necessarily</em> requires copying your document data from disk to memory to cpu to memory to display – lots of copying. Did Claris need the rights to your copyright to allow you to edit your documents in its software?</p>

<p>I think that we know that it isn’t the case that Claris needed (or had) a legal right to your intellectual property in order to “use” your data in order to let you edit your story.</p>

<p>If that example feels esoteric - since we’re talking about copies, how about copy machines?</p>

<p>If I walk up to a copy machine manufactured by Konica Minolta and copy a proprietary document, am I instantaneously granting Konica Minolta a license to “use” the copy? We know that many industrial copiers have <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/digital-copier-data-security-guide-businesses">hard drives in them</a> - does that mean the next time the disk goes back to Konica Minolta for warranty service, they get to use the documents to train algorithms to more accurately copy those types of documents?</p>

<p>I don’t think that is the case – clearly this is a <em>new</em> right being assigned. We do not assume that mere usage of a copier grants the copier company the right to use your data outside of of what is required to make the copy. We don’t even need the company involved at all! Indeed, I would expect that a responsible company would either destroy hard drives with customer data on them, or to securely wipe them before reuse.</p>

<p>In a more modern software example, guidance on the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#CanIUseGPLToolsForNF">GPL specifically clarifies that using open source software to create non-free software</a> is allowed - there is no assumption that using open source software to produce documents similarly grants the rights holders of the software in use rights to your creative work. Artworks created in Inkscape aren’t free to be used by the developers of Inkskape. Clearly, users of open source software aren’t automatically granting developers rights to their work. Why is Firefox different?</p>

<li>
<p><code>random</code> will produce different values from previous versions of fish when used with the same seed, and will work more sensibly with small seed numbers.<br>
The seed was never guaranteed to give the same result across systems,<br>
so we do not expect this to have a large impact (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9593" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/9593/hovercard">#9593</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Variables in command position that expand to a subcommand keyword are now forbidden to fix a likely user error.<br>
For example, <code>set editor command emacs; $editor</code> is no longer allowed (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10249" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10249/hovercard">#10249</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>functions --handlers</code> will now list handlers in a different order.<br>
Now it is definition order, first to last, where before it was last to first.<br>
This was never specifically defined, and we recommend not relying on a specific order (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9944" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/9944/hovercard">#9944</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>qmark-noglob</code> feature, introduced in fish 3.0, is enabled by default. That means <code>?</code> will no longer act as a single-character glob.<br>
You can, for the time being, turn it back on by adding <code>no-qmark-noglob</code> to <code>fish_features</code> and restarting fish:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="set -Ua fish_features no-qmark-noglob"><pre lang="fish-docs-samples"><code>set -Ua fish_features no-qmark-noglob
</code></pre></div>
<p>The flag will eventually be made read-only, making it impossible to turn off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terminals that fail to ignore unrecognized OSC or CSI sequences may display garbage. We know cool-retro-term and emacs’ ansi-term are affected, but most mainstream terminals are not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fish no longer searches directories from the Windows system/user <code>$PATH</code> environment variable for Linux executables. To execute Linux binaries by name (i.e. not with a relative or absolute path) from a Windows folder, make sure the <code>/mnt/c/...</code> path is explicitly added to <code>$fish_user_paths</code> and not just automatically appended to <code>$PATH</code> by <code>wsl.exe</code> (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10506" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10506/hovercard">#10506</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under Microsoft Windows Subsystem for Linux 1 (not WSL 2), backgrounded jobs that have not been disowned and do not terminate on their own after a <code>SIGHUP</code> + <code>SIGCONT</code> sequence will be explicitly killed by fish on exit (after the usual prompt to close or disown them) to work around a WSL 1 deficiency that sees backgrounded processes that run into <code>SIGTTOU</code> remain in a suspended state indefinitely (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5263" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5263/hovercard">#5263</a>). The workaround is to explicitly <code>disown</code> processes you wish to outlive the shell session.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Notable improvements and fixes</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<p>fish now requests XTerm’s <code>modifyOtherKeys</code> keyboard encoding and <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/" rel="nofollow">kitty keyboard protocol’s</a> progressive enhancements (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10359" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10359/hovercard">#10359</a>).<br>
Depending on terminal support, this allows to binding more key combinations, including arbitrary combinations of modifiers <code>ctrl</code>, <code>alt</code> and <code>shift</code>, and distinguishing (for example) <code>ctrl-i</code> from <code>tab</code>.</p>
<p>Additionally, <code>bind</code> now supports a human-readable syntax in addition to byte sequences.<br>
This includes modifier names, and names for keys like <code>enter</code> and <code>backspace</code>.<br>
For example</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bind up 'do something'</code> binds the up-arrow key instead of a two-key sequence (“u” and then “p”)</li>
<li><code>bind ctrl-x,alt-c 'do something'</code> binds a sequence of two keys.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any key argument that starts with an ASCII control character (like <code>\e</code> or <code>\cX</code>) or is up to 3 characters long, not a named key, and does not contain <code>,</code> or <code>-</code> will be interpreted in the old syntax to keep compatibility for the majority of bindings.</p>
<p>Keyboard protocols can be turned off by disabling the “keyboard-protocols” feature flag:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="set -Ua fish_features no-keyboard-protocols"><pre lang="fish-docs-samples"><code>set -Ua fish_features no-keyboard-protocols
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is a temporary measure to work around buggy terminals (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11056" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/11056/hovercard">#11056</a>), which appear to be relatively rare.<br>
Use this if something like “=0” or “=5u” appears in your commandline mysteriously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fish can now be built as a self-installing binary (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10367" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10367/hovercard">#10367</a>). That means it can be easily built on one system and copied to another, where it can extract supporting files.<br>
To do this, run:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cargo install --path . # in a clone of the fish repository
# or `cargo build --release` and copy target/release/fish{,_indent,_key_reader} wherever you want"><pre lang="fish-docs-samples"><code>cargo install --path . # in a clone of the fish repository
# or `cargo build --release` and copy target/release/fish{,_indent,_key_reader} wherever you want
</code></pre></div>
<p>The first time it runs interactively, it will extract all the data files to  <code>~/.local/share/fish/install/</code>. A specific path can be used for the data files with <code>fish --install=PATH</code> To uninstall, remove the fish binaries and that directory.</p>
<p>This build system is experimental; the main build system, using <code>cmake</code>, remains the recommended approach for packaging and installation to a prefix.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new function <code>fish_should_add_to_history</code> can be overridden to decide whether a command should be added to the history (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10302" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10302/hovercard">#10302</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bindings can now mix special input functions and shell commands, so <code>bind ctrl-g expand-abbr "commandline -i \n"</code> works as expected (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8186" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8186/hovercard">#8186</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Special input functions run from bindings via <code>commandline -f</code> are now applied immediately, instead of after the currently executing binding (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3031" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3031/hovercard">#3031</a>, <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10126" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10126/hovercard">#10126</a>).<br>
For example, <code>commandline -i foo; commandline | grep foo</code> succeeds now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Undo history is no longer truncated after every command, but kept for the lifetime of the shell process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>ctrl-r</code> history search now uses glob syntax (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10131" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10131/hovercard">#10131</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>ctrl-r</code> history search now operates only on the line or command substitution at cursor, making it easier to combine commands from history (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9751" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9751/hovercard">#9751</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abbreviations can now be restricted to specific commands. For instance:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="abbr --add --command git back 'reset --hard HEAD^'"><pre lang="fish-docs-samples"><code>abbr --add --command git back 'reset --hard HEAD^'
</code></pre></div>
<p>will expand “back” to <code>reset --hard HEAD^</code>, but only when the command is <code>git</code> (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9411" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9411/hovercard">#9411</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deprecations and removed features</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>commandline --tokenize</code> (short option <code>-o</code>) has been deprecated in favor of <code>commandline --tokens-expanded</code> (short option <code>-x</code>) which expands variables and other shell syntax, removing the need to use <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/blob/4.0.0/cmds/eval.md">eval</a> in completion scripts (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10212" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10212/hovercard">#10212</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two new feature flags:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>remove-percent-self</code> (see <code>status features</code>) disables PID expansion of <code>%self</code>, which has been supplanted by <code>$fish_pid</code> (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10262" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10262/hovercard">#10262</a>).</li>
<li><code>test-require-arg</code> disables <code>test</code>’s one-argument mode. That means <code>test -n</code> without an additional argument will return false, <code>test -z</code> will keep returning true. Any other option without an argument, anything that is not an option and no argument will be an error. This also goes for <code>[</code>, test’s alternate name.<br>
This is a frequent source of confusion and so we are breaking with POSIX explicitly in this regard.<br>
In addition to the feature flag, there is a debug category “deprecated-test”. Running fish with <code>fish -d deprecated-test</code> will show warnings whenever a <code>test</code> invocation that would change is used. (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10365" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10365/hovercard">#10365</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>These can be enabled with:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="set -Ua fish_features remove-percent-self test-require-arg"><pre lang="fish-docs-samples"><code>set -Ua fish_features remove-percent-self test-require-arg
</code></pre></div>
<p>We intend to enable them by default in future, and after that eventually make them read-only.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specifying key names as terminfo names (using the <code>bind -k</code> syntax) is deprecated and may be removed in a future version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a terminal pastes text into fish using bracketed paste, fish used to switch to a special <code>paste</code> bind mode.<br>
This bind mode has been removed. The behavior on paste is no longer configurable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When an interactive fish is stopped or terminated by a signal that cannot be caught (SIGSTOP or SIGKILL), it may leave the terminal in a state where keypresses with modifiers are sent as CSI u sequences, instead of traditional control characters or escape sequences that are recognized by Readline and compatible programs, such as bash and python.<br>
If this happens, you can use the <code>reset</code> command from <code>ncurses</code> to restore the terminal state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>fish_key_reader --verbose</code> no longer shows timing information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terminal information is no longer read from hashed terminfo databases, or termcap databases (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10269" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10269/hovercard">#10269</a>). The vast majority of systems use a non-hashed terminfo database, which is still supported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>source</code> returns an error if used without a filename or pipe/redirection (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10774" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10774/hovercard">#10774</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Scripting improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>for</code> loops will no longer remember local variables from the previous iteration (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10525" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10525/hovercard">#10525</a>).</li>
<li>A new <code>history append</code> subcommand appends a command to the history, without executing it (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4506" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4506/hovercard">#4506</a>).</li>
<li>A new redirection: <code>&lt;? /path/to/file</code> will try opening the file as input, and if it doesn’t succeed silently uses <code>/dev/null</code> instead.<br>
This can help with checks like <code>test -f /path/to/file; and string replace foo bar &lt; /path/to/file</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10387" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10387/hovercard">#10387</a>)</li>
<li>A new option <code>commandline --tokens-raw</code> prints a list of tokens without any unescaping (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10212" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10212/hovercard">#10212</a>).</li>
<li>A new option <code>commandline --showing-suggestion</code> tests whether an autosuggestion is currently displayed (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10586" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10586/hovercard">#10586</a>).</li>
<li><code>functions</code> and <code>type</code> now show that a function was copied and its source, rather than solely <code>Defined interactively</code> (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6575" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6575/hovercard">#6575</a>).</li>
<li>Stack trace now shows line numbers for copied functions (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6575" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6575/hovercard">#6575</a>).</li>
<li><code>foo &amp; &amp;&amp; bar</code> is now a syntax error, like in other shells (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9911" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9911/hovercard">#9911</a>).</li>
<li><code>if -e foo; end</code> now prints a more accurate error (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10000" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10000/hovercard">#10000</a>).</li>
<li><code>cd</code> into a directory that is not readable but accessible (permissions <code>--x</code>) is now possible (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10432" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10432/hovercard">#10432</a>).</li>
<li>An integer overflow in <code>string repeat</code> leading to a near-infinite loop has been fixed (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9899" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9899/hovercard">#9899</a>).</li>
<li><code>string shorten</code> behaves better in the presence of non-printable characters, including fixing an integer overflow that shortened strings more than intended (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9854" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/9854/hovercard">#9854</a>).</li>
<li><code>string pad</code> no longer allows non-printable characters as padding (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9854" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/9854/hovercard">#9854</a>).</li>
<li><code>string repeat</code> now allows omission of <code>-n</code> when the first argument is an integer (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10282" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10282/hovercard">#10282</a>).</li>
<li><code>string match</code> and <code>replace</code> have a new <code>--max-matches</code> option to return as soon as the specified number of matches have been identified, which can improve performance in scripts (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10587" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10587/hovercard">#10587</a>).</li>
<li><code>functions --handlers-type caller-exit</code> once again lists functions defined as <code>function --on-job-exit caller</code>, rather than them being listed by <code>functions --handlers-type process-exit</code>.</li>
<li>A new <code>set --no-event</code> option sets or erases variables without triggering a variable event. This can be useful to change a variable in an event handler (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10480" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10480/hovercard">#10480</a>).</li>
<li>Commas in command substitution output are no longer used as separators in brace expansion, preventing a surprising expansion in some cases (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5048" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5048/hovercard">#5048</a>).</li>
<li>Universal variables can now store strings containing invalid UTF-8 (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10313" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10313/hovercard">#10313</a>).</li>
<li>A new <code>path basename -E</code> option that causes it to return the basename (“filename” with the directory prefix removed) with the final extension (if any) also removed. This is a shorter version of <code>path change-extension "" (path basename $foo)</code> (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10521" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10521/hovercard">#10521</a>).</li>
<li>A new <code>math --scale-mode</code> option to select <code>truncate</code>, <code>round</code>, <code>floor</code>, <code>ceiling</code> as you wish; the default value is <code>truncate</code>. (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9117" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9117/hovercard">#9117</a>).</li>
<li><code>random</code> is now less strict about its arguments, allowing a start larger or equal to the end. (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10879" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10879/hovercard">#10879</a>)</li>
<li><code>function --argument-names</code> now produces an error if a read-only variable name is used, rather than simply ignoring it (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10842" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10842/hovercard">#10842</a>).</li>
<li>Tilde expansion in braces (that is, <code>{~,}</code>) works correctly (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10610" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10610/hovercard">#10610</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Interactive improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Autosuggestions were sometimes not shown after recalling a line from history, which has been fixed (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10287" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10287/hovercard">#10287</a>).</li>
<li>Up-arrow search matches -- which are highlighted in reverse colors -- are no longer syntax-highlighted, to fix bad contrast with the search match highlighting.</li>
<li>Command abbreviations (those with <code>--position command</code> or without a <code>--position</code>) now also expand after decorators like <code>command</code> (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10396" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10396/hovercard">#10396</a>).</li>
<li>Abbreviations now expand after process separators like <code>;</code> and <code>|</code>. This fixes a regression in version 3.6 (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9730" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9730/hovercard">#9730</a>).</li>
<li>When exporting interactively defined functions (using <code>type</code>, <code>functions</code> or <code>funcsave</code>) the function body is now indented, to match the interactive command line editor (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8603" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/8603/hovercard">#8603</a>).</li>
<li><code>ctrl-x</code> (<code>fish_clipboard_copy</code>) on multiline commands now includes indentation (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10437" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10437/hovercard">#10437</a>).</li>
<li><code>ctrl-v</code> (<code>fish_clipboard_paste</code>) now strips ASCII control characters from the pasted text.<br>
This is consistent with normal keyboard input (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5274" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5274/hovercard">#5274</a>).</li>
<li>When a command like <code>fg %2</code> fails to find the given job, it no longer behaves as if no job spec was given (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9835" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9835/hovercard">#9835</a>).</li>
<li>Redirection in command position like <code>&gt;echo</code> is now highlighted as error (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8877" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8877/hovercard">#8877</a>).</li>
<li><code>fish_vi_cursor</code> now works properly inside the prompt created by builtin <code>read</code> (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10088" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10088/hovercard">#10088</a>).</li>
<li>fish no longer fails to open a FIFO if interrupted by a terminal resize signal (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10250" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10250/hovercard">#10250</a>).</li>
<li><code>read --help</code> and friends no longer ignore redirections. This fixes a regression in version 3.1 (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10274" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10274/hovercard">#10274</a>).</li>
<li>Measuring a command with <code>time</code> now considers the time taken for command substitution (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9100" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9100/hovercard">#9100</a>).</li>
<li><code>fish_add_path</code> now automatically enables verbose mode when used interactively (in the command line), in an effort to be clearer about what it does (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10532" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10532/hovercard">#10532</a>).</li>
<li>fish no longer adopts TTY modes of failed commands (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10603" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10603/hovercard">#10603</a>).</li>
<li><code>complete -e cmd</code> now prevents autoloading completions for <code>cmd</code> (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6716" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6716/hovercard">#6716</a>).</li>
<li>fish’s default color scheme no longer uses the color “blue”, as it has bad contrast against the background in a few terminal’s default palettes (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10758" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10758/hovercard">#10758</a>, <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10786" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10786/hovercard">#10786</a>)<br>
The color scheme will not be upgraded for existing installs. If you want, you should select it again via <code>fish_config</code>.</li>
<li>Command lines which are larger than the terminal are now displayed correctly, instead of multiple blank lines being displayed (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7296" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7296/hovercard">#7296</a>).</li>
<li>Prompts that use external commands will no longer produce an infinite loop if the command crashes (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9796" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9796/hovercard">#9796</a>).</li>
<li>Undo (<code>ctrl-z</code>) restores the cursor position too (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10838" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10838/hovercard">#10838</a>).</li>
<li>The output of <code>jobs</code> shows “-” for jobs that have the same process group ID as the fish process, rather than “-2” (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10833" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10833/hovercard">#10833</a>).</li>
<li>Job expansion (<code>%1</code> syntax) works properly for jobs that are a mixture of external commands and functions (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10832" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10832/hovercard">#10832</a>).</li>
<li>Command lines which have more lines than the terminal can be displayed and edited correctly (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10827" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10827/hovercard">#10827</a>).</li>
<li>Functions that have been erased are no longer highlighted as valid commands (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10866" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10866/hovercard">#10866</a>).</li>
<li><code>not</code>, <code>time</code>, and variable assignments (that is <code>not time a=b env</code>) is correctly recognized as valid syntax (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10890" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10890/hovercard">#10890</a>).</li>
<li>The Web-based configuration removes old right-hand-side prompts again, fixing a regression in fish 3.4.0 (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10675" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10675/hovercard">#10675</a>).</li>
<li>Further protection against programs which crash and leave the terminal in an inconsistent state (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10834" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10834/hovercard">#10834</a>, <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11038" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11038/hovercard">#11038</a>).</li>
<li>A workaround for git being very slow on macOS has been applied, improving performance after a fresh boot (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10535" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10535/hovercard">#10535</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h4>New or improved bindings</h4>
<ul>
<li>When the cursor is on a command that resolves to an executable script, <code>alt-o</code> will now open that script in your editor (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10266" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10266/hovercard">#10266</a>).</li>
<li>During up-arrow history search, <code>shift-delete</code> will delete the current search item and move to the next older item. Previously this was only supported in the history pager.</li>
<li><code>shift-delete</code> will also remove the currently-displayed autosuggestion from history, and remove it as a suggestion.</li>
<li><code>ctrl-Z</code> (also known as <code>ctrl-shift-z</code>) is now bound to redo.</li>
<li>Some improvements to the <code>alt-e</code> binding which edits the command line in an external editor:
<ul>
<li>The editor’s cursor position is copied back to fish. This is currently supported for Vim and Kakoune.</li>
<li>Cursor position synchronization is only supported for a set of known editors, which are now also detected in aliases which use <code>complete --wraps</code>. For example, use <code>complete --wraps my-vim vim</code> to synchronize cursors when <code>EDITOR=my-vim</code>.</li>
<li>Multiline commands are indented before being sent to the editor, which matches how they are displayed in fish.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>...-path-component</code> bindings, like <code>backward-kill-path-component</code>, now treat <code>#</code> as part of a path component (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10271" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10271/hovercard">#10271</a>).</li>
<li>Bindings like <code>alt-l</code> that print output in between prompts now work correctly with multiline commandlines.</li>
<li><code>alt-d</code> on an empty command line lists the directory history again. This restores the behavior of version 2.1.</li>
<li><code>history-prefix-search-backward</code> and <code>-forward</code> now maintain the cursor position, instead of moving the cursor to the end of the command line (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10430" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10430/hovercard">#10430</a>).</li>
<li>The following keys have refined behavior if the terminal supports <a href="#changelog-new-bindings">the new keyboard encodings</a>:
<ul>
<li><code>shift-enter</code> now inserts a newline instead of executing the command line.</li>
<li><code>ctrl-backspace</code> now deletes the last word instead of only one character (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10741" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10741/hovercard">#10741</a>).</li>
<li><code>ctrl-delete</code> deletes the next word (same as <code>alt-d</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New special input functions:
<ul>
<li><code>forward-char-passive</code> and <code>backward-char-passive</code> are like their non-passive variants but do not accept autosuggestions or move focus in the completion pager (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10398" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10398/hovercard">#10398</a>).</li>
<li><code>forward-token</code>, <code>backward-token</code>, <code>kill-token</code>, and <code>backward-kill-token</code> are similar to the <code>*-bigword</code> variants but for the whole argument token (which includes escaped spaces) (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2014" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2014/hovercard">#2014</a>).</li>
<li><code>clear-commandline</code>, which merely clears the command line, as an alternative to <code>cancel-commandline</code> which prints <code>^C</code> and a new prompt (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10213" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10213/hovercard">#10213</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>accept-autosuggestion</code> special input function now returns false when there was nothing to accept (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10608" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10608/hovercard">#10608</a>).</li>
<li>Vi mode has seen some improvements but continues to suffer from the lack of people working on it.
<ul>
<li>New default cursor shapes for insert and replace mode.</li>
<li><code>ctrl-n</code> in insert mode accepts autosuggestions (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10339" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10339/hovercard">#10339</a>).</li>
<li>Outside insert mode, the cursor will no longer be placed beyond the last character on the commandline.</li>
<li>When the cursor is at the end of the commandline, a single <code>l</code> will accept an autosuggestion (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10286" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10286/hovercard">#10286</a>).</li>
<li>The cursor position after pasting (<code>p</code>) has been corrected.</li>
<li>Added an additional binding, <code>_</code>, for moving to the beginning of the line (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10720" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10720/hovercard">#10720</a>).</li>
<li>When the cursor is at the start of a line, escaping from insert mode no longer moves the cursor to the previous line.</li>
<li>Added bindings for clipboard interaction, like <code>",+,p</code> and <code>",+,y,y</code>.</li>
<li>Deleting in visual mode now moves the cursor back, matching vi (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10394" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10394/hovercard">#10394</a>).</li>
<li>The <code>;</code>, <code>,</code>, <code>v</code>, <code>V</code>, <code>I</code>, and <code>gU</code> bindings work in visual mode (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10601" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10601/hovercard">#10601</a>, <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10648" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10648/hovercard">#10648</a>).</li>
<li>Support <code>%</code> motion (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10593" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10593/hovercard">#10593</a>).</li>
<li><code>ctrl-k</code> to remove the contents of the line beyond the cursor in all modes (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10648" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10648/hovercard">#10648</a>).</li>
<li>Support ab and ib vi text objects. New input functions are introduced <code>jump-{to,till}-matching-bracket</code> (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1842" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1842/hovercard">#1842</a>).</li>
<li>The <code>E</code> binding now correctly handles the last character of the word, by jumping to the next word (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9700" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/9700/hovercard">#9700</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Completions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Command-specific tab completions may now offer results whose first character is a period. For example, it is now possible to tab-complete <code>git add</code> for files with leading periods. The default file completions hide these files, unless the token itself has a leading period (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3707" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3707/hovercard">#3707</a>).</li>
<li>Option completion now uses fuzzy subsequence filtering, just like non-option completion (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/830" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/830/hovercard">#830</a>).<br>
This means that <code>--fb</code> may be completed to <code>--foobar</code> if there is no better match.</li>
<li>Completions that insert an entire token now use quotes instead of backslashes to escape special characters (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5433" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/5433/hovercard">#5433</a>).</li>
<li>Normally, file name completions start after the last <code>:</code>  or <code>=</code> in a token.<br>
This helps commands like <code>rsync --files-from=</code>.<br>
This special meaning can now disabled by escaping these separators as <code>\:</code> and <code>\=</code>.<br>
This matches Bash’s behavior.<br>
Note that this escaping is usually not necessary since the completion engine already tries<br>
to guess whether the separator is actually part of a file name.</li>
<li>Various new completion scripts and numerous updates to existing ones.</li>
<li>Completions could hang if the <code>PAGER</code> environment variable was sent to certain editors on macOS, FreeBSD and some other platforms. This has been fixed (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10820" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10820/hovercard">#10820</a>).</li>
<li>Generated completions are now stored in <code>$XDG_CACHE_HOME/fish</code> or <code>~/.cache/fish</code> by default (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10369" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10369/hovercard">#10369</a>)</li>
<li>A regression in fish 3.1, where completing a command line could change it completely, has been fixed (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10904" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10904/hovercard">#10904</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Improved terminal support</h4>
<ul>
<li>fish now marks the prompt and command-output regions (via OSC 133) to enable terminal shell integration (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10352" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10352/hovercard">#10352</a>).<br>
Shell integration shortcuts can scroll to the next/previous prompt or show the last command output in a pager.</li>
<li>fish now reports the working directory (via OSC 7) unconditionally instead of only for some terminals (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9955" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/9955/hovercard">#9955</a>).</li>
<li>fish now sets the terminal window title (via OSC 0) unconditionally instead of only for some terminals (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10037" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10037/hovercard">#10037</a>).</li>
<li>Focus reporting in tmux is no longer disabled on the first prompt.</li>
<li>Focus reporting is now disabled during commands run inside key bindings (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6942" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6942/hovercard">#6942</a>).</li>
<li>Cursor changes are applied to all terminals that support them, and the list of specifically-supported terminals has been removed (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10693" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10693/hovercard">#10693</a>).</li>
<li>If it cannot find the terminfo entry given by <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/blob/4.0.0/language.md#envvar-TERM"><code>TERM</code></a> environment variable, fish will now use an included <code>xterm-256color</code> definition to match the vast majority of current terminal emulators (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10905" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10905/hovercard">#10905</a>). If you need to have a specific terminfo profile for your terminal’s <code>TERM</code> variable, install it into the terminfo database.</li>
<li>Further improvements to the correct display of prompts which fill the width of the terminal (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8164" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8164/hovercard">#8164</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>status</code> gained a <code>buildinfo</code> subcommand, to print information on how fish was built, to help with debugging (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10896" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10896/hovercard">#10896</a>).</li>
<li><code>fish_indent</code> will now collapse multiple empty lines into one (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10325" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10325/hovercard">#10325</a>).</li>
<li><code>fish_indent</code> now preserves the modification time of files if there were no changes (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10624" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10624/hovercard">#10624</a>).</li>
<li>Performance in launching external processes has been improved for many cases (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10869" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10869/hovercard">#10869</a>).</li>
<li>Performance and interactivity under Windows Subsystem for Linux has been improved, with a workaround for Windows-specific locations being appended to <code>$PATH</code> by default (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10506" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10506/hovercard">#10506</a>).</li>
<li>On macOS, paths from <code>/etc/paths</code> and <code>/etc/manpaths</code> containing colons are handled correctly (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10684" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10684/hovercard">#10684</a>).</li>
<li>Additional filesystems such as AFS are properly detected as remote, which avoids certain hangs due to expensive filesystem locks (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10818" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10818/hovercard">#10818</a>).</li>
<li>A spurious error when launching multiple instances of fish for the first time has been removed (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10813" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10813/hovercard">#10813</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h3>For distributors</h3>
<p>fish has been ported to Rust. This means a significant change in dependencies, which are listed in the README. In short, Rust 1.70 or greater is required, and a C++ compiler is no longer needed (although a C compiler is still required, for some C glue code and the tests).</p>
<p>CMake remains the recommended build system, because of cargo’s limited support for installing support files. Version 3.5 remains the minimum supported version. The Xcode generator for CMake is not supported any longer (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9924" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9924/hovercard">#9924</a>). CMake builds default to optimized release builds (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10799" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10799/hovercard">#10799</a>).</p>
<p>fish no longer depends on the ncurses library, but still uses a terminfo database. When packaging fish, please add a dependency on the package containing your terminfo database instead of curses.</p>
<p>The <code>test</code> target was removed as it can no longer be defined in new CMake versions. Use <code>make fish_run_tests</code>. Any existing test target will not print output if it fails (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11116" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/11116/hovercard">#11116</a>).</p>
<p>The Web-based configuration has been rewritten to use Alpine.js (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9554" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/9554/hovercard">#9554</a>).</p>
<h3>Changes since fish 4.0b1</h3>
<p>A number of improvements were included in fish 4.0.0 following the beta release of 4.0b1. These include fixes for regressions, improvements to completions and documentation, and the removal of a small number of problematic changes.</p>
<p>The full list of fixed issues can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/milestone/43">GitHub milestone page for 4.0-final</a>.</p>

with 9.0% compared to God's 7.0%. </p><p>In every other decade, God remained the most thanked figure.</p><p>Across all years, the most thanked living people have been Steven Spielberg, Harvey Weinstein, George Lucas, Francis Ford Coppola, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Peter Jackson, Sheila Nevins, and Martin Scorsese.</p><p>And with that… it’s been my privilege. Thank you</p><p><span>I reached out to the Oscar’s most thanked woman, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheila_Nevins" rel="">Shelia Nevins</a><span>, for comment. After just one phone call, I could see exactly why she earned that place.</span></p><p>With a career spanning over six decades, Nevins has produced more than 1,000 documentaries, racking up 31 Primetime Emmys, 42 Peabody Awards, and 26 Oscars along the way. As the long-time head of HBO Documentary Films, she not only shaped the genre but also nurtured countless filmmakers, making her a near-obligatory mention in many acceptance speeches.</p><p>On learning of her status as the most thanked woman in Oscar history, she said:</p><blockquote><p>I was very surprised to see that, but I have been doing it for so long. I have been doing the grunt work for so long. I think when people get up there, they decide for me. So they say, 'Thank you’.  It is lovely to be thanked, and it really hurts when you are not thanked. I have been thanked for things I did not deserve, and I have been not thanked for things I bled over.</p></blockquote><p>I asked her if she was surprised that Steven Spielberg was thanked more than God.</p><blockquote><p><span>No, because God does not attend. When people thank God, they look up. Have you noticed that? They always look up. When they thank Steven Spielberg, they look out. Also, </span><strong>God cannot give them their next job - Steven Spielberg can</strong><span>.</span></p></blockquote><p>And there we have it.  Shelia summed up what we’ve learned today better than I ever could.  Thank you, Shelia.</p><p><span>This analysis was based on full transcripts of 1,884 Oscar acceptance speeches given between 1939 and 2023, sourced from the </span><a href="https://aaspeechesdb.oscars.org/" rel="">official Oscars website</a><span>. Some charts focus only on 2000 to 2023, as speech lengths increased significantly toward the end of the 20th century, making direct comparisons across eight decades less reliable. In such cases, I prioritised more recent data to better reflect the modern Oscars. Unless stated otherwise, all data covers the full period from 1939 to 2023.</span></p><p>There is a difference between "a speech" and an individual winner’s contribution to that speech. In most cases, a single winner spoke, so everything they said counted as "the speech". However, when multiple winners took the stage, I counted the combined words of all speakers as a single speech.</p><p><span>I did not count instances where people were thanked as part of a vague group, such as "</span><em>the Academy</em><span>", "</span><em>my cast</em><span>", "</span><em>American friends of Poland</em><span>", "</span><em>the Kenyan people</em><span>", or simply "</span><em>America</em><span>".</span></p><p>Over the years, the Academy has frequently changed award structures and category names, often splitting or merging them. To keep things consistent, I grouped similar awards together. For example, cinematography was once divided into black-and-white and colour categories. Music scoring awards have also taken many forms, from Original Dramatic Score to Scoring of a Musical Picture.</p><p><span>Finding God has eluded many people over the years and He certainly presented some challenges in this research. Despite being everywhere, He was not always easy to identify. A simple word search for "</span><em>God</em><span>" was unreliable because it picked up false positives such as "</span><em>God, what a night!</em><span>". Instead, I focused on whether a winner was genuinely directing thanks to a higher power. This meant that Sean Penn’s </span><a href="https://aaspeechesdb.oscars.org/link/076-1/" rel="">exclamation</a><span>, "</span><em>God, I really thank Clint Eastwood professionally and humanly for coming into my life</em><span>" did not count, but Josie MacAvin’s 1985 </span><a href="https://aaspeechesdb.oscars.org/link/058-5/" rel="">declaration</a><span>, "</span><em>First of all, I want to thank The Man Above</em><span>" did</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-157879572" href="https://stephenfollows.com/p/harvey-weinstein-thanked-more-than-god#footnote-1-157879572" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span>.</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p><em>This coverage is made possible through a partnership between </em><a href="https://grist.org/"><em>Grist</em></a>, <a href="https://www.bpr.org/"><em>BPR</em></a><em>, a public radio station serving western North Carolina, </em><a href="https://www.wbez.org/"><em>WBEZ</em></a><em>, a public radio station serving the Chicago metropolitan region, and </em><a href="https://www.interlochenpublicradio.org/"><em>Interlochen Public Radio</em></a><em> in Northern Michigan.</em></p>



<p>On a recent Friday afternoon, Marie Richards sat in her living room in northern Michigan. She was having a hard time talking about her job at the U.S. Forest Service in the past tense.</p>



<p>“I absolutely loved my job,” she said. “I didn’t want to go.”</p>



<p>Richards, a citizen of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, was a tribal relations specialist at the <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/hmnf">Huron-Manistee National Forests</a>. In mid-February, she found out she was one of the some 3,400 workers who had been targeted for layoffs — an estimated 10 percent of the workforce — as part of the Trump administration’s move to cut costs and shrink the federal government.</p>



<p>Richards watched as some of her colleagues were laid off on February 14 — the <a href="https://planetdetroit.org/2025/02/federal-employees-fired-valentine-day-massacre/">so-called</a> Valentine’s Day massacre, when the Trump administration laid off thousands of probationary employees, generally hired within the past two years. She got a call from her supervisor that Saturday informing her that she had been let go, too. The letter she received cited performance issues, even though she, along with others in a similar position, had received a pay raise less than two months earlier.</p>



<p>“None of us deserved this,” Richards said. “We all work hard and we’re dedicated to taking care of the land.”</p>



<p>The U.S. Forest Service, which&nbsp;stewards 193 million acres of public lands from Alaska to Florida, was in trouble even before Trump took office. Chronically understaffed, the service was already under a <a href="https://www.hcn.org/articles/the-forest-service-is-cutting-its-seasonal-workforce-and-public-lands-will-suffer/">Biden-era hiring freeze</a>, all the while on the front lines of fighting and recovering from back-to-back climate disasters across the country.</p>

<p>For now, workers with the Forest Service fear this isn’t just the end of the line for their dream careers, but also a turning point for public lands and what they mean in the United States.</p>



<p>“It’s catastrophic,” said Anders Reynolds with the Southern Environmental Law Center, a nonprofit that litigates environmental issues in the southeastern U.S. “We are losing an entire generation of talent and passion.”</p>



<p>The federal agency does more than ensure that Americans have a place to hunt, hike, fish, or paddle. In the South, forest workers played a key role in helping western North Carolina and other communities recover from impacts of Hurricane Helene. In the West, they’re taking on fire risk mitigation and fighting wildfires. They’re also involved in fisheries management in places like Alaska. Across the country, agency biologists and foresters are busy working to strengthen the over 150 national forests and 20 grasslands it monitors in the face of changing climate.</p>



<p>Increasingly, the service is getting spread thin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The agency has experienced a steady decrease in staffing over the last decade and the workers that remain are often overworked and underpaid, according to Reynolds.</p>



<p>“That means you’re going to see those campgrounds close, the trails go unmaintained, roads closed, you’re going to feel the effects of wildfire and hurricane recovery work that’s just going to remain undone,” said Reynolds. “Communities are going to struggle.”</p>



<p>The Forest Service has reduced its capacity over many years, causing headaches for staff.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://nafsr.org/advocacy/2019/072619%20Workforce%20Capacity%20Study.pdf">report</a> from the National Association of Forest Service Retirees showed the agency losing a little over half of staff who supported specialty ecological restoration projects — meaning a whole range of jobs, from botanists to foresters to wildlife and fisheries biologists — between 1992 and 2018. As a result, understaffed Forest Service ranger districts, hemorrhaging staff positions, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GAOREPORTS-GAO-01-53R/html/GAOREPORTS-GAO-01-53R.htm">have consolidated</a>.</p>



<p>Former employees report they saw serious financial and staffing shortages during their time. Bryan Box, a former timber sale administrator with the Forest Service who took some time out of the agency to care for his aging mother, said he found the working conditions unsuitable for a stable, normal life. Box worked for the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest in Wisconsin, where he said he made so little he biked around on his off days rather than wasting money on gas. While he was working, multiple national forests around him consolidated, causing a downward spiral on organizational capacity.</p>

<p>“We decommissioned buildings, we decommissioned the infrastructure that we had back in the ‘80s and ‘90s when we had this huge staff,” Box said. “And that put us into a position where we couldn’t hire seasonal employees anymore because we didn’t have housing for them. In rural northern Wisconsin, you know, just there’s not any housing available really. I think at one point our firefighters were all living above a bar.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other foresters he knew failed to make rent and were evicted or lived itinerantly, couch-surfing, for the love of the work they did. For Box, the financial realities became untenable. So, too, had the restrictions on his work, which grew as budgets failed to grow.</p>



<p>Box’s program was expensive to run and required travel, often to reduce fire fuels by harvesting timber after an emergency. The program he worked for, Box said, ended up needing to reduce costs by cutting travel funds and ending overtime, making it difficult for him to do his job well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Much of their work involves emergency response, not only fighting fires but also picking up the pieces after conflagrations and hurricanes leave potentially thousands of acres of dead timber.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Matthew Brossard works as the current business representative and organizer for the National Federation of Federal Employees, and was formerly the general vice president for the National Federation of Federal Employees’ Forest Service Council, which represents around 18,000 employees of the Forest Service, 6,000 of whom are probationary, meaning they have either recently been hired or moved to a new position within the agency. Typically, probation — a part of every federal hiring process — is one or two years. Probationary employees were primarily targeted in the layoffs, meaning a generation of hires is potentially interrupted.&nbsp;Brossard said even though the administration maintains they have not fired positions essential to public safety, there’s more to fighting fires than just the firefighters. Support and logistical personnel are essential. “Extra dispatchers, security to close off roads, food unit leaders, base camp managers, all these very important, 100 percent-needed positions. Those people are getting terminated right now,” Brossard said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In another instance recounted by Brossard, someone on assignment to help with long-term hurricane recovery in Louisiana was fired while he was there. The employee lived in Oregon and reported having no financial support for his trip home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The loss of a seasonal workforce will also be felt, Brossard added. “Without that influx of seasonal workforce, it puts a huge amount of work onto the permanent staff if they’re still employed to do all the work,” he said, meaning not only trailwork and campground maintenance, but also research and other essential work. “So the work that in the summer that should have been done by 15 or 20 people are now going to be done by five or six.”</p>



<p>As workers continue to struggle with the fallout of their abrupt firings, their union is jumping in to protect them, Brossard said. The NFFE-FSC has joined in multiple lawsuits to challenge the firings, including one filed February 12, provided to Grist, that aims to put a stop to the firings and reverse the ones that have already happened, on grounds that the terminations are unlawful. A decision on the lawsuit is still to come, with more potential legal action following, Brossard said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You’re not reducing, you know,&nbsp;the stereotypical bureaucrats,” Brossard said. “You’re reducing the boots on the ground that are going out and doing work.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>In an emailed statement to Grist, a spokesperson with the U.S. Department of Agriculture said the new agricultural secretary, Brooke Rollins, supported Trump’s directive to cut spending and inefficiencies while strengthening the department’s services. “As part of this effort, USDA has made the difficult decision to release about 2,000 probationary, non-firefighting employees from the Forest Service. To be clear, none of these individuals were operational firefighters.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The statement continued, “Released employees were probationary in status, many of whom were compensated by temporary IRA funding. It’s unfortunate that the Biden administration hired thousands of people with no plan in place to pay them long term. Secretary Rollins is committed to preserving essential safety positions and will ensure that critical services remain uninterrupted.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Back in northern Michigan, Marie Richards, the former tribal relations specialist, crunched down the snowy driveway, pointing toward the Huron-Manistee National Forests where she worked. It spans nearly 1 million acres and covers land tribal nations ceded in two treaties, which the federal government has a responsibility to keep in trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Richards said workers like her are also a vital part of pushing the federal government to meet its trust responsibility to tribal nations. She helped connect the region’s federally recognized tribes with officials and staff at the forest service, set up meetings, and ensured work was being carried out responsibly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s not just the damage to that trust relationship with the Forest Service,” said Richards, who left her job as a repatriation and historic preservation specialist for the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians to work at the agency. “It’s across the board for so many things, and tribes trying to work through that freeze, and making people understand that this isn’t DEI — that this is governmental affairs.”</p>



<p>Richards doesn’t know what’s next; she wants to finish her dissertation (about the impact of the lumber industry on traditional cultural landscapes and Anishinaabe bands and communities) and continue her work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It still really hurts that this dream of mine is kind of shattered, and we’ll see, and find a new dream,” she said. “But ultimately, my career, my livelihood, is in tribal relations for our heritage and I will find a home somewhere.”</p>

    <h2>Interactive Demo</h2>
    <p>
      This is a demo of our simulated piano playing agent trained with reinforcement learning. It runs
      MuJoCo natively in your browser thanks to <a href="https://github.com/zalo/mujoco_wasm/">WebAssembly</a>.
      You can use your mouse to interact with it, for example by dragging down the piano keys to generate sound
      or pushing the hands to perturb them. The controls section in the top right corner can be used to
      change songs and the simulation section to pause or reset the agent. Make sure you click the
      demo at least once to enable sound.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Simulation</h3>
    <p>
      We build our simulated piano-playing environment using the open-source <a href="https://mujoco.org/">MuJoCo</a>
      physics engine.
      It consists in a full-size 88-key digital keyboard and two <a href="https://www.shadowrobot.com/">Shadow Dexterous
        Hands</a>,
      each with 24 degrees of freedom.
    </p>
    
    <img src="https://kzakka.com/robopianist/assets/environment.png" id="robopianist-env">
    
    <h3>Musical representation</h3>
    <p>
      We use the Musical Instrument Digital Interface (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI">MIDI</a>) standard
      to represent
      a musical piece as a sequence of time-stamped messages corresponding to "note-on" or "note-off" events. A message
      carries
      additional pieces of information such as the pitch of a note and its velocity.
    </p>
    <p>
      We convert the MIDI file into a time-indexed note trajectory (also known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_roll">piano roll</a>),
      where each note is represented as a one-hot vector of length 88 (the number of keys on a piano). This trajectory
      is used as the goal
      representation for our agent, informing it which keys to press at each time step.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interactive plot below shows the song Twinkle Twinkle Little Star encoded as a piano roll. The x-axis
      represents
      time in seconds, and the y-axis represents musical pitch as a number between 1 and 88. You can hover over each
      note to
      see what additional information it carries.
    </p>
    
    <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesizer">synthesizer</a> can be used to convert MIDI files to raw
      audio:</p>
    <audio controls="" src="https://kzakka.com/robopianist/assets/twinkle_twinkle.wav"></audio>
    <h3>Musical evaluation</h3>
    <p>
      We use precision, recall and F1 scores to evaluate the proficiency of our agent. If at a given instance of time
      there are keys that should be "on"
      and keys that should be "off", precision measures how good the agent is at not hitting any of the keys that should
      be "off", while recall measures
      how good the agent is at hitting all the keys that should be "on". The F1 score combines the precision and recall
      into a single metric, and ranges
      from 0 (if either precision or recall is 0) to 1 (perfect precision and recall).
    </p>
    <h3>Piano fingering and dataset</h3>
    <p>
      Piano fingering refers to the assignment of fingers to notes in a piano piece (see figure below).
      Sheet music will typically provide sparse fingering labels for the tricky sections of a piece to
      help guide pianists, and pianists will often develop their own fingering preferences for a given
      piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      In RoboPianist, we found that the agent struggled to learn to play the piano with a sparse reward signal
      due to the exploration challenge associated with the high-dimensional action space. To overcome this issue,
      we added human priors in the form of the fingering labels to the reward function to guide its exploration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since fingering labels aren't available in MIDI files by default, we used annotations from the Piano Fingering
      Dataset (<a href="https://beam.kisarazu.ac.jp/~saito/research/PianoFingeringDataset/">PIG</a>) to create 150
      labeled MIDI files, which we call Repertoire-150 and release as part of our environment.
    </p>

    </div>
    <h3>MDP Formulation</h3>
    <p>
      We model piano-playing as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP) defined by a tuple \( (\mathcal{S},
      \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{\rho}, \mathcal{p}, r, \gamma, H) \),
      where \( \mathcal{S} \) is the state space, \( \mathcal{A} \) is the action space, \( \mathcal{\rho}(\cdot) \) is
      the initial state distribution, \( \mathcal{p} (\cdot | s, a) \)
      governs the dynamics, \( r(s, a) \) is the reward function, \( \gamma \) is the discount factor, and \( H \) is
      the horizon. The goal of the agent is to
      maximize its total expected discounted reward over the horizon \( \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=0}^{H} \gamma^t r(s_t,
      a_t) \right] \).
    </p>
    <p>
      At every time step, the agent receives proprioceptive (i.e, hand joint angles), exteroceptive (i.e., piano
      key states) and goal observations (i.e., piano roll) and outputs 22 target joint angles for each hand. These
      are fed to proportional-position actuators which convert them to torques at each joint. The agent then
      receives a weighted sum of reward terms, including a reward for hitting the correct keys, a reward for
      minimizing energy consumption, and a shaping reward for adhering to the fingering labels.
    </p>
    <p>
      For our policy optimizer, we use a state-of-the-art model-free RL algorithm <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02034">DroQ</a>
      and train our agent for 5 million steps with a control frequency of 20 Hz.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- quantitative results -->
  <section>
    <h2>Quantitative Results</h2>
    <p>
      With careful system design, we improve our agent's performance significantly. Specifically,
      adding an energy cost to the reward formulation, providing a few seconds worth of future goals
      rather than just the current goal, and constraining the action space helped the agent learn
      faster and achieve a higher F1 score. The plot below shows the additive effect of each of
      these design choices on three different songs of increasing difficulty.
    </p>
    <p><img src="https://kzakka.com/robopianist/assets/design_considerations.png">
    </p>
    <p>
      When compared to a strong derivative-free model predictive control (MPC) baseline, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00541">Predictive Sampling</a>,
      our agent achieves a much higher F1 score, averaging 0.79 across Etude-12 versus 0.43 for Predictive Sampling.

    <h2>Qualitative Results</h2>
    <p>
      Each video below is playing real-time and shows our agent playing every song in the Etude-12 subset.
      In each video frame, we display the fingering labels by coloring the keys according to the
      corresponding finger color. When a key is pressed, it is colored green.
    </p>
    <h3>Debug dataset</h3>
    <p>
      This dataset contains "entry-level" songs (e.g., scales) and is useful for sanity checking an agent's performance.
      Fingering labels in this dataset were manually annotated by the authors of this paper. It is not part of the
      Repertoire-150 dataset.

        <figcaption>
          Since the Shadow Hand forearms are thicker than a human's, the agent sometimes struggles to nail down notes
          that are really close together. Adding full rotational and translational degrees of freedom to the hands could
          give them the ability to overcome this limitation, but would pose additional challenges for learning.

          The agent struggles with songs that require stretching the fingers over many notes, sometimes more than 1
          octave.
