<hr></div><p>The <a href="https://girlsintech.org/">Girls in Tech </a>nonprofit women’s tech community is closing its doors after 17 years, according to a newsletter from founder <a href="https://venturebeat.com/business/adriana-gascoigne-on-how-girls-in-tech-can-get-women-to-infiltrate-silicon-valley/">Adriana Gascoigne</a>.</p>



<p>Gascoigne said the decision was made with “sadness and devastation” and was not made lightly.</p>



<p>“It is with a heavy heart that I share the news that Girls in Tech will be closing its doors. This decision was not made lightly, and the sadness and devastation we feel cannot be overstated,” Gascoigne wrote. “For 17 incredible years, we have offered a welcoming community based on empowerment, support, and inspiration for women in the tech industry. Together, we have made a profound impact, helping women reach for the stars and excel in their careers, while working tirelessly to eliminate the gender gap in tech worldwide.”</p>

<p>The group reached more than 250,000 individuals across 35 chapters in 30 countries on six continents. It was founded in Silicon Valley, but <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/adriana-gascoigne-why-girls-in-tech-moved-to-nashville/">Gascoigne relocated the group to Nashville</a>, Tennessee, in 2022 during the pandemic. I interviewed her numerous times about the group’s mission and goals, and how it rose to greater relevance in fighting the “<a href="https://venturebeat.com/business/girls-in-techs-adriana-gascoigne-fights-the-toxic-culture-of-silicon-valley/">toxic culture</a>” of Silicon Valley.</p>

The passion to support, uplift, and inspire each other is what has truly set us apart. I am immensely proud of what we have built together and the lasting impact we have made,” Gascoigne said in the newsletter.</p>



<p>The group’s programs included a mentorship program, hackathons, coding bootcamps, the Girls in Tech Conference, a startup challenge, global classroom, podcast, blog, jobs board, and shop. The group organized thousands of in-person and virtual events, producing educational and engaging content. </p>

<p>“To everyone who poured their heart into building this wonderful community where women in tech could have a voice, learn, grow, and be celebrated just as they are—I am profoundly grateful,” Gascoigne said. “A special thanks to all of our members, who established such a friendly, warm, and collaborative environment and culture; the managing directors and advisory board teams who led our chapters; our staff at headquarters who managed and grew the organization; our sponsors who funded our programs and events; and our board of directors.”</p>



<p>Without explanation, Gascoigne said in closing, “Though Girls in Tech is closing its doors, the movement we started must and will continue. I encourage each of you to carry on the fight to eliminate the gender gap in tech. Our mission will live on in other forms, driven by the same passion and commitment that have always defined us. I will miss you all deeply. Thank you for being a part of this incredible journey.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: We’re introducing the “free as in beer”, self-hosted and AGPL-licensed Plausible Community Edition (CE). <a href="https://github.com/plausible/community-edition/">Installation instructions are here</a>.</p> <p>In October 2020, we changed <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/open-source-licenses">from the MIT to the AGPL license</a> to prevent corporations from exploiting our code without giving back.</p> <p>As mentioned at the time, we wanted a “don’t be evil” license. Here’s the quote of what we wrote more than three years ago on what we were trying to accomplish with the license change:</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li>We want to prevent corporations from taking our code and using it as part of their closed-source proprietary products</li> <li>We want to prevent corporations from offering Plausible as a service without contributing to the open source project</li> <li>We want to prevent corporations from confusing people and making them think that the service they sell is in any shape or form approved by the original team</li> </ul> <p>And we don’t want this to in any way impact the actual use case Plausible is built for. A completely open source and self-hostable web analytics tool that helps people de-Googlify their sites and respect the privacy of their visitors.</p> </blockquote> <p>That license change has helped us build <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/open-source-saas">a sustainable open source project</a> with 8 core team members and several paid external contributors at the time of writing. We don’t have any investors, so all this is solely funded by the fees our 12,000+ subscribers pay us.</p> <p>As we’ve progressed in our journey, we’ve become aware that despite its advantages, the AGPL license doesn’t go far enough to protect us against all the threats we face. To better protect our project in the future, we’re changing some things about our self-hosted release. These changes don’t affect anyone subscribing to the Plausible Analytics managed hosting in the cloud. Everything stays the same there.</p> <p>If you have a blog, a personal site or a business site, we want you to be able to self-host our code on your servers without needing to pay us any fees if that’s your preference. Nothing changes about this either. Our self-hosted code continues being AGPL-licensed, “free as in beer” and is the same code running in the production on our Plausible Analytics managed hosting in the cloud.&nbsp;</p> <p>Here’s more on what’s being changed and why.</p> <ol id="markdown-toc"> <li><a href="#threats-were-facing" id="markdown-toc-threats-were-facing">Threats we’re facing</a></li> <li><a href="#sticking-to-the-agpl-license" id="markdown-toc-sticking-to-the-agpl-license">Sticking to the AGPL license&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="#changes-were-making-to-our-self-hosted-release" id="markdown-toc-changes-were-making-to-our-self-hosted-release">Changes we’re making to our self-hosted release</a> <ol> <li><a href="#our-self-hosted-release-will-be-called-plausible-community-edition" id="markdown-toc-our-self-hosted-release-will-be-called-plausible-community-edition">Our self-hosted release will be called Plausible Community Edition</a></li> <li><a href="#a-stronger-moat-for-our-official-managed-hosting" id="markdown-toc-a-stronger-moat-for-our-official-managed-hosting">A stronger moat for our official managed hosting</a></li> <li><a href="#features-to-be-offered-on-top-of-plausible-ce" id="markdown-toc-features-to-be-offered-on-top-of-plausible-ce">Features to be offered on top of Plausible CE</a></li> </ol> </li> <li><a href="#ensuring-the-continuous-sustainability" id="markdown-toc-ensuring-the-continuous-sustainability">Ensuring the continuous sustainability</a></li> </ol> <h2 id="threats-were-facing">Threats we’re facing</h2> <p>We want to reduce the threat from businesses such as hosting companies and other resellers who try to commercialize popular open source projects. We’ve seen our self-hosted code being used in a way it was never intended for by corporations that don’t care about us or open source. Our license doesn’t prevent these corporations from using the Plausible Analytics name and logo either, as these are a part of our self-hosted code.</p> <p>We face threats both from single-tenant and multi-tenant hosts and resellers. These entities compete against us using our work and brand without contributing back. For them it’s a business opportunity to commercialize open source software. They are even damaging our brand. We’ve had cases of these entities:</p> <ul> <li>Confusing people and making them think that we approve of the service they run</li> <li>Reselling our self-hosted code while running Google Analytics and other surveillance capitalism scripts on their site</li> <li>Using Google and Amazon-owned servers despite promising that they’re running on <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/google-analytics-illegal">EU-owned infrastructure</a></li> <li>Having a bad user experience with under provisioned servers, slow loading time, frequent downtime and no support&nbsp;</li> <li>Running paid advertising on Google and paying referral fees for people to promote them. Both marketing tactics that <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/best-marketing-practices">we say no to ourselves</a></li> </ul> <p>These use cases were never the intention behind our self-hosted release. We wanted to give site owners a way to de-Google their sites even if they didn’t want to or couldn’t use our managed service. Now, we’re facing situations where companies much larger than us with much bigger resources use our brand to compete against us and gain a business advantage.</p> <p>It’s telling that these entities rarely decide to build their brand on top of our code. They prefer to use the brand we’ve built instead as it gives them a better and easier starting point. These actions not only threaten our sustainability but also mislead people who trust the Plausible Analytics name. We want to ensure that anyone using or considering our services knows precisely what they’re getting, without confusion or misrepresentation.</p> <h2 id="sticking-to-the-agpl-license">Sticking to the AGPL license&nbsp;</h2> <p>We’re real people who have rent to pay and mouths to feed. We make $300 per month from donations from our self-hosted users. It would take us more than ten years of donations to pay one month of salary for our small team. If we cannot capture the economic value of our work, the project will become unsustainable and die.</p> <p>We believe this would not only hurt us as people but also all of the users of the product. Our self-hosted users directly benefit from the investments we can put into product development. All this is made possible and solely funded by the revenue we get from our managed hosting in the cloud.</p> <p>We’ve learned that being open source and transparent has costs. Dealing with these threats is an incredibly taxing and time-consuming distraction for our small team. It’s something our proprietary competitors never even have to think about.</p> <p>Several popular open source projects have shifted away from traditional models in the last few years because of similar threats that we’re facing. They’re adopting licenses such as the Business Source License (BSL) or the Server Side Public License (SSPL) as these licenses more directly address the concerns about resellers and hosting companies.</p> <p>These licenses are <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/">not approved nor recognized by the Open Source Initiative (OSI)</a>, which is why we’re not interested in switching to them. We want to stay open source to continue providing a transparent and privacy-friendly web analytics tool with a “free as in beer” self-hosted release.</p> <h2 id="changes-were-making-to-our-self-hosted-release">Changes we’re making to our self-hosted release</h2> <p>Here’s how we’ll proceed with our self-hosted release. These changes will go live with the next version of our self-hosted release (2.1.0).&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/plausible/analytics/releases/tag/v2.1.0-rc.0">Release notes are here</a>.</p>  <p>Our self-hosted release will be renamed Plausible Community Edition (or Plausible CE). Plausible CE will also have a different logo from the Plausible Analytics managed hosting in the cloud. This is the main change you’ll see if you’re running our self-hosted code on your server.&nbsp;</p> <p>Plausible CE continues to be AGPL-licensed and “free as in beer”. It continues to be the same code running in the production on our managed hosting. As we’ve done so far, we’ll keep maintaining, improving and adding features to the Plausible CE with new releases twice annually.</p> <p>To further protect our brand from threats, we’ve registered trademarks for Plausible Analytics on both sides of the Atlantic.&nbsp;</p> <h3 id="a-stronger-moat-for-our-official-managed-hosting">A stronger moat for our official managed hosting</h3> <p>We’re excluding features we use to manage Plausible Analytics at scale, such as the sites API and customer relationship management system, from Plausible CE. As a self-hoster, you likely haven’t noticed these features, as they’ve been undocumented and are primarily helpful when providing web analytics as a service.</p> <p>We’re also keeping some of the newly released business and enterprise features (<a href="https://plausible.io/docs/funnel-analysis">funnels</a> and <a href="https://plausible.io/docs/ecommerce-revenue-tracking">ecommerce revenue metrics</a> at the time of being) exclusive to the business plan subscribers on our Plausible Analytics managed hosting.&nbsp;</p> <p>The code for all these features is still available to the public so it can be reviewed and inspected, but these features will not be a part of Plausible CE and they’ll have a different license.</p> <p>This change also means that if you want to contribute to our codebase in the future as an external contributor, you’ll need to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).</p> <p>To provide a better service and experience to people who pay our bills, Plausible CE will continue to not have any premium customer support and is <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/building-open-source">community-supported only</a>.</p> <p>This open core model is something that GitLab and other open source projects have championed and we believe it’s the best and most open source friendly approach for the situation we’re in.</p> <h3 id="features-to-be-offered-on-top-of-plausible-ce">Features to be offered on top of Plausible CE</h3> <p>The plan moving forward is to carefully consider which features to keep exclusive to our managed cloud hosting. These will predominantly be features that help us run our managed hosting at scale and enterprise features. We aim always to ensure a protective barrier around our cloud offering.</p> <p>This doesn’t mean that all business and enterprise features won’t ever make it to the Plausible CE. Nothing from Plausible CE will be taken away in the future and we plan to periodically evaluate business and enterprise features to be added to Plausible CE.&nbsp;</p> <p>For instance, we’ve already decided to release <a href="https://plausible.io/docs/custom-props/introduction">custom properties</a> (another business feature in the cloud) as part of the Plausible CE. We’ll update the release notes with any new features making their way to Plausible CE in the future.</p> <h2 id="ensuring-the-continuous-sustainability">Ensuring the continuous sustainability</h2> <p>These changes will affect corporations that take our code to compete directly against us as it will create a more substantial moat and better protection for our official managed hosting. It will get more challenging for them to misrepresent their association with us or use our brand and logo misleadingly. And they won’t be able to offer a fully featured Plausible Analytics product with all the enterprise features included either.</p> <p>Many indie hackers that contact us about our experience of running an open source startup tell us that their main concern about open sourcing their code is the risk that large corporations will resell that code and take advantage of their project. It’s a valid concern. We hope that our new approach mitigates most potential downsides and still allows the upsides of releasing our code free to the world.&nbsp;</p> <p>With the change of our self-hosted release name and logo, the registration of our trademarks and the exclusive availability of certain enterprise features to our managed cloud hosting, we aim to better ensure the sustainability of Plausible Analytics in the face of external threats in the future.

<h2>Welcome to the home of Railway Signalling Simulations</h2>

<h2>So what is SimSig?</h2>

<p>
    Welcome to the world of railway signalling! SimSig brings the signal box to your home PC and with it the enjoyment and frustrations of running today's (and some of yesterday's) railways. How often has your train been delayed because of "signal failure" and you've wondered why trains can't be routed around the problem - or why it is even a problem in the first place? You'll soon see exactly why - with SimSig!
</p>
<p>
    SimSig puts you in the seat of a signaller, also called a Dispatcher or Network Control Officer, operating signalling screens based on the widely used IECC and Westcad graphics used in the UK. That is, you operate the signals and points/switches
    in order to get trains to their destinations on time. SimSig has a wide range of areas you can operate including large portions of the UK, a small US
    simulation, and a couple of Australian areas. Each has its own challenges and skill level, the latter ranging from easy to mentally complicated.

<h3>The Brief Specs</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Replicates the operation of British IECCs (Integrated Electronic Control Centres)</li>
    <li>All signalling equipment simulated (track circuits, points, signals, etc.)</li>
    <li>Correct signalling (overlaps, aspect sequencing, approach control)</li>
    <li>Emphasis is on quality and realism, not quantity</li>
    <li>Used by signallers, drivers, and other professionals from all over the world</li>
    <li>User oriented - tell us what you want, we'll try to produce it!</li>
    <li>Free demo downloads of every simulation available right now</li>
</ul>

<p>SimSig runs on Windows 8.1 and 10.</p>

<p>
    <i>
        SimSig also runs on <a href="https://www.simsig.co.uk/Wiki/Show?page=usertrack:install">emulators such as Wine for Linux and Crossover for Mac</a>. This is not guaranteed but we try to keep such emulators supported.
        Tablets and phones are not supported.
    </i>
</p>

<h2>How much is it?</h2>

<p>
    You can peruse prices in our <a href="https://www.simsig.co.uk/Store">Shop</a> but we have several <b>free</b> simulations, then range from under £10 upwards,
    depending on the complexity of the simulation. All simulations come with an evaluation period so you can try before you buy.
</p>

<h2>Can I play with friends?</h2>

<p>
    Yes! Many of our simulations are suitable for multiplayer. The larger simulations have as many as nine positions keeping people busy. But many
    simulations also have optional automation such as ARS (Automatic Route Setting) which means you can run a larger simulation by yourself.
</p>

<p>
    Multiplayer works over the Internet, or your home LAN. One person acts as the host while others connect with an IP address and port number. We
    have run multiplayers across the world with members in the UK, the US, Australia, Europe, and elsewhere.
</p>

<p>Many simulations can be "chained", which is where adjacent areas can be linked together to form a larger area.</p>

<h2>Can I contribute?</h2>

<p>
    Unlike other products, anybody can write a timetable using the in-built timetable editor. We also do not charge for extra timetables. Our files
    area has plenty of user-contributed timetables to download.
</p>

<p><i>Sorry, users cannot produce simulations themselves.</i></p>

<h2>What does it look like?</h2>

<p><img src="https://www.simsig.co.uk/Media/LivSt2.gif"></p><p>
    Here we have the free Liverpool Street simulation running. ARS (automatic route setting) is setting the routes but we can easily take over.
    The eighteen platforms at Liverpool Street in London are very busy during the morning rush hour that we see here. The blue four-character
    labels are the train descriptions (like a flight number) such as 2H07. The signaller can identify the routing and destination of the train
    from that train description. The flashing white blobs indicate that a train is ready to depart. White lines show route set for trains, while
    you can see the signals showing red (stop), yellow (caution), double yellow (preliminary caution), or green.
</p>
<p><i>This animated GIF is running at approximately 4x normal speed.</i></p>
<center>
    
    
    <p><i><small>You must download and install the system files (from the <b>Download Now!</b> link above; under 3MB) before any simulations can be played</small></i></p>

<p>Europe's new heavy-lift rocket, Ariane 6, made its inaugural flight from Europe's Spaceport in French Guiana at 16:00 &nbsp;local time on 9 July (20:00 BST, 21:00 CEST).</p>

		<p>Ariane 6 is the latest in Europe's Ariane rocket series, taking over from Ariane 5, and featuring a modular and versatile design that can launch missions from low-Earth orbit and farther out into deep space.</p><p>"A completely new rocket is not launched often, and success is far from guaranteed. I am privileged to have witnessed this historic moment when Europe's new generation of the Ariane family lifted off – successfully – effectively reinstating European access to space,” said ESA's Director General Josef Aschbacher.</p><p>"An inaugural launch is a huge undertaking from thousands of people who have worked relentlessly for years. To see it perform wonderfully at the first attempt is testament to their dedication and a demonstration of European excellence in engineering and technology. Heartfelt thanks go to the teams at ESA, CNES, ArianeGroup and Arianespace for their hard work to get to this point. I also want to sincerely thank our Member States for having enabled and supported the Ariane 6 programme along the way. Not always easy, but the endurance shown has paid off handsomely today."</p>	</div>

		<p>This inaugural flight, designated VA262, is a demonstration flight whose aim is to show the capabilities and prowess of Ariane 6 in escaping Earth's gravity and operating in space. Nevertheless, it had several passengers on board.</p><p>At 21:06 BST, 22:06 CEST,&nbsp;one hour after liftoff, the first set of satellites on board Ariane 6 were released from the upper stage and placed into an orbit 600 km above Earth. Satellites and experiments from various space agencies, companies, research institutes, universities and young professionals were included on this inaugural flight.</p>	</div>

		<p>In addition to the rocket, the liftoff demonstrated the functioning of the launch pad and operations on the ground at Europe's Spaceport. The new custom-built dedicated launch zone was built by France's space agency CNES and allows for a faster turnover of Ariane launches.</p><p>On the occasion of the launch, Philippe Baptiste, CEO of CNES, said: “With this first successful launch by Ariane 6, Europe has finally recovered its capacity to access space. Beyond the great emotion I am feeling right now, my first thoughts are for all the teams in Kourou, Paris, Vernon, Les Mureaux, Toulouse, Bremen, Lampoldshausen, Liège, Barcelona, Colleferro, Zürich and everywhere else in Europe who made this success possible. I would like to acknowledge the commitment of the employees of CNES, ESA, ArianeGroup, Arianespace and our subcontractors. The last few months have been intense, and I would like to thank them all. Europe can be proud of its space programme, Europe can be proud of its knowledge and expertise. Together, let's prepare the future of launchers and space.”</p>	</div>	
    
						
			<p>Ariane 6 was built by prime contractor and design authority ArianeGroup. “With the successful first flight of Ariane&nbsp;6, the European space industry has moved into a new era,” said Martin Sion, CEO of ArianeGroup. “This historic launch demonstrates the unfailing commitment of our teams and partners, whom I would like to thank warmly for this success, which reflects on the entire European industry. Seeing Europe’s new launcher lift off into space marks the culmination of an outstanding technical and technological adventure, and the beginning of a long history of Ariane&nbsp;6 operations. The next flight models are already in production and the stages of the second model will be shipped to the Guiana Space Centre this autumn for the first commercial flight of Ariane&nbsp;6.”</p>

		<p>With the placement of satellites into orbit, Ariane 6 has demonstrated that it can successfully launch its payloads into space, but ground control has more in store for its inaugural flight. Over the next hour, Ariane 6's upper stage will show again that it can restart its Vinci engine using the novel auxiliary propulsion unit. This restart capability will allow Ariane 6 to drop off multiple passengers into different orbits on future flights and deorbit itself through Earth’s atmosphere at the end of its mission, to ensure it does not become space debris.</p><p>On this flight the Ariane 6 upper stage is set to release two reentry capsules as it enters Earth's atmosphere for a clean disposal to burn up harmlessly, leaving no space debris in orbit.</p>	</div>

		<p>The next Ariane 6 is planned for launch this year on its first commercial flight under Arianespace as operator and launch service provider. “The success of this first flight marks the start of Ariane&nbsp;6’s operational career, giving Europe an autonomous access to space,” added Stéphane Israël, CEO of Arianespace. “The new launcher’s order book is proof of the versatility of Ariane 6 and of its capacity to accomplish a wide range of missions into multiple orbits. It reflects the confidence that customers have in Ariane 6 for both their institutional and commercial missions. We are eager to begin operating our new launcher.”</p>	</div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>The amount of sugar consumed by children from soft drinks in the UK halved within a year of the sugar tax being introduced, a study has found.</p><p>The tax, which came into force in April 2018, has been so successful in improving people’s diets that experts have said an expansion to cover other high sugar food and drink products is now a “no-brainer”.</p><p>The <a href="https://jech.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/jech-2023-221051" data-link-name="in body link">research</a>, published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, looked at responses from 7,999 adults and 7,656 children between 2008 and 2019 to the annual nationally representative UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey.</p><p>It showed that the daily sugar intake for children fell by about 4.8g, and for adults 10.9g, in the year after the levy’s introduction.</p><p>The total dietary free sugars, including food and drink, in children was about 70g a day at the beginning of the study, but this fell to about 45g by the end.</p><p>For adults, the study found that the total dietary free sugar consumption stood at about 60g a day, and fell to about 45g a day by the end of the study.</p><p>But despite this reduction, the amount of sugar consumed by adults and children still remains above the recommended guidelines and is contributing to high levels of tooth decay, obesity, diabetes and other illnesses.</p><p>The study found that compared to the period before the sugar tax was announced in 2016, free sugars consumed from all soft drinks reduced by around a half in children, and by a third in adults, after the levy was announced.</p><p>The researchers also note that the fall in consumption of free sugars observed in the whole diet rather than just from soft drinks suggests that consumption of free sugar from food was also falling from as early as 2008.</p><p>Eddie Crouch, the chair of the British Dental Association, said that the sugar tax was delivering “tangible results” and was effective.</p><p>He added: “Extending it to the likes of cereals is a no-brainer for any government that cares about prevention. This needn’t add to the cost of living. Where voluntary action on reformulation has failed, the levy forces the food industry to do the right thing.”</p><p>According to the World <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Health</a> Organization and the UK Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition, the consumption of free sugar should be below 5% of a person’s total calorie intake. For adults, this would be limited to 30g of sugar a day, 24g for children aged between 7 and 10, and 19g for children aged between 4 and 6.</p><p>Dr Nina Rogers, the lead author of the study and part of the University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, said: “The findings of our study are encouraging and show that the UK soft drinks industry levy is linked to a significant reduction in daily sugar intake in adults and children. These results are consistent with previous research which show a reduction in household purchasing of sugar from soft drinks one year after adoption of the levy.”</p><figure id="c7041e84-e774-4012-b332-a1c667e8109c" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:13,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Does Australia need a sugar tax to tackle diabetes, and how would it work?&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;c7041e84-e774-4012-b332-a1c667e8109c&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jul/04/australia-sugar-tax-diabetes-parliamentary-report&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0,&quot;design&quot;:0}}"></gu-island></figure><p>She added: “The new UK government might want to consider extending the tax to other (currently exempt) drinks which have a high sugar content, or even to some foods. They might also want to look at restructuring the tax to apply a per gram of sugar/100mls rather than threshold-based levy.”</p><p>Dr Kawther Hashem, a lecturer in Public Health Nutrition at Queen Mary University of London, said: “This new analysis drives home the importance of policies designed to improve the nutritional quality of food and drink. In particular, the soft drinks industry levy (SDIL) in the UK has proven to be an effective lever to encourage food and drink manufacturers to reduce sugar.</p><p>“With a new government now in place, policymakers are urged to consider applying a similar levy to other discretionary products that are key contributors to sugar intake, such as chocolate confectionery, to shift diets towards a healthier direction.”</p><p>A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “This government will take action to prevent ill-health and tackle the obesity crisis head on, easing the strain on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">NHS</a> and helping people to live well for longer.</p><p>“We will introduce tight restrictions on advertising junk food, alongside banning children from being able to purchase sugary, high-caffeine energy drinks.</p><p>“By building a healthier society, we will help to build a healthy economy.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

Well, let’s see if you hold on to the same opinion by the end of this post. </p><p id="whats-the-big-deal-with-aws-account"><h2>What's the Big Deal with AWS Account IDs?</h2></p><p> First things first, let's get our basics straight. </p><p> Every AWS account has a unique 12-digit identifier. </p><div><ol start="1"><li><p> These IDs are part of most AWS resource's <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference-arns.html?utm_source=mail.cloudsecurity.club&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=well-it-s-just-an-aws-account-id" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Amazon Resource Name</a> (ARN). </p></li><li><p> They're crucial for sharing resources between accounts (using resource policies or Resource Access Manager) </p></li><li><p> They're used in sharing resources outside your AWS accounts, especially with external vendors. </p></li></ol></div><p> In simple terms, your AWS Account ID is your identity in the AWS cloud. If someone needs to access your resources or if you need to intentionally share your resources with others, you need to provide them with your AWS Account ID. </p><p id="the-power-of-knowing-an-account-id"><h2>The Power of Knowing an Account ID</h2></p><p> Imagine you're a red teamer or black box pentester (or worse, an attacker). With just an Account ID, you can: </p><p><b>Bruteforce IAM Entities:</b> You can bruteforce for the existence of common IAM users and roles. This information is gold for phishing attacks, social engineering, or password spraying. You can also see the user name patterns for IAM users (especially those of the target’s infra or DevOps team). An attacker with this information could craft convincing phishing emails or vishing scripts targeting the company's cloud team. </p><div><p><span>Tool Spotlight: Check out the </span><span><a href="https://github.com/dagrz/aws_pwn/blob/master/reconnaissance/validate_iam_principals.py?utm_source=mail.cloudsecurity.club&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=well-it-s-just-an-aws-account-id" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">validate_iam_principals.py</a></span><span> script in the </span><span><a href="https://github.com/dagrz/aws_pwn?utm_source=mail.cloudsecurity.club&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=well-it-s-just-an-aws-account-id" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">aws_pwn</a></span><span> GitHub repository.

I say “might” here because enabling an AWS service like GuardDuty will create the service-linked role. But if you turn it off, AWS will not delete the role. If the role doesn’t exist, it's 100% certain that GuardDuty is not enabled in the target account. </p><p> Note: You can use the same technique to determine whether the target AWS account uses services like EKS or ECS, allowing you to fine-tune your attacks and web app payloads. </p><p><b>Find Public Resources:</b> You can search for the target company's unintentional public resources, from public EBS snapshots to AMIs. </p><div><ul><li><p> EBS Snapshots: <a href="https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-1&amp;utm_source=mail.cloudsecurity.club&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=well-it-s-just-an-aws-account-id#Snapshots:visibility=public;sort=snapshotId" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-1#Snapshots:visibility=public;sort=snapshotId</a></p></li><li><p> RDS Snapshots: <a href="https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home?region=us-east-1&amp;utm_source=mail.cloudsecurity.club&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=well-it-s-just-an-aws-account-id#snapshots-list:tab=public" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home?region=us-east-1#snapshots-list:tab=public</a></p></li><li><p> DocumentDB Snapshots: <a href="https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/docdb/home?region=us-east-1&amp;utm_source=mail.cloudsecurity.club&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=well-it-s-just-an-aws-account-id#snapshots" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/docdb/home?region=us-east-1#snapshots</a></p></li><li><p> Neptune Snapshots: <a href="https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/neptune/home?region=us-east-1&amp;utm_source=mail.cloudsecurity.club&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=well-it-s-just-an-aws-account-id#snapshots:type=public" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/neptune/home?region=us-east-1#snapshots:type=public</a></p></li><li><p> Public AMIs: <a href="https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-1&amp;utm_source=mail.cloudsecurity.club&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=well-it-s-just-an-aws-account-id#Images:visibility=public-images" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-1#Images:visibility=public-images</a></p></li></ul></div><p><b>Correlate Resources (Niche):</b> You can confirm if a leaked resource belongs to a specific company. </p><p> Account IDs can be crucial in HackerOne or other bug bounty reports where you can correlate a misconfigured S3 bucket leaking PII belonging to the target company by matching Account IDs. </p><p><b>Evade Detection (Niche):</b> Some security tools, like <a href="https://canarytokens.org/?utm_source=mail.cloudsecurity.club&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=well-it-s-just-an-aws-account-id" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">CanaryTokens.org</a>, create credentials from known AWS accounts.

<li>Each routing request has a <em>cost threshold</em> that controls the tradeoff between cost and quality.

<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="> python -m routellm.calibrate_threshold --routers mf --strong-model-pct 0.5 --config config.example.yaml
For 50.0% strong model calls for mf, threshold = 0.11593"><pre><code>&gt; python -m routellm.calibrate_threshold --routers mf --strong-model-pct 0.5 --config config.example.yaml
For 50.0% strong model calls for mf, threshold = 0.11593
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This means that we want to use <code>0.11593</code> as our threshold so that approximately 50% of all queries (those that require GPT-4 the most) will be routed to it (see <a href="#threshold-calibration">Threshold Calibration</a> for details).</p>
<ol start="3" dir="auto">
<li>Now, let's update the <code>model</code> field when we generate completions to specify the router and threshold to use:</li>
</ol>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="response = client.chat.completions.create(
  # This tells RouteLLM to use the MF router with a cost threshold of 0.11593
  model=&quot;router-mf-0.11593&quot;,
  messages=[
    {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Hello!&quot;}
  ]
)"><pre><span>response</span> <span>=</span> <span>client</span>.<span>chat</span>.<span>completions</span>.<span>create</span>(

  ]
)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">That's it! Now, requests with be routed between the strong and weak model depending on what is required, <strong>saving costs while maintaining a high quality of responses</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Depending on your use case, you might want to consider using a different model pair, modifying the configuration, or calibrating the thresholds based on the types of queries you receive to improve performance.</p>

<p dir="auto">In the above examples, GPT-4 and Mixtral 8x7B are used as the model pair, but you can modify this using the <code>strong-model</code> and <code>weak-model</code> arguments.</p>
<p dir="auto">We leverage <a href="https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm">LiteLLM</a> to support chat completions from a wide-range of open-source and closed models. In general, you need a setup an API key and point to the provider with the appropriate model name. Alternatively, you can also use <strong>any OpenAI-compatible endpoint</strong> by prefixing the model name with <code>openai/</code> and setting the <code>--base-url</code> and <code>--api-key</code> flags.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that regardless of the model pair used, an <code>OPENAI_API_KEY</code> will currently still be required to generate embeddings for the <code>mf</code> and <code>sw_ranking</code> routers.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Motivation</h2><a id="user-content-motivation" aria-label="Permalink: Motivation" href="#motivation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Different LLMs vary widely in their costs and capabilities, which leads to a dilemma when deploying them: routing all queries to the most capable model leads to the highest-quality responses but can be very expensive, while routing queries to smaller models can save costs but may result in lower-quality responses.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>LLM routing</em> offers a solution to this. We introduce a router that looks at queries and routes simpler queries to smaller, cheaper models, saving costs while maintaining quality. We focus on routing between 2 models: a stronger, more expensive model and a cheaper but weaker model. Each request is also associated with a <em>cost threshold</em> that determines the cost-quality tradeoff of that request - a higher cost threshold leads to lower cost but may lead to lower-quality responses.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Server</h2><a id="user-content-server" aria-label="Permalink: Server" href="#server"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">RouteLLM offers a lightweight OpenAI-compatible server for routing requests based on different routing strategies:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python -m routellm.openai_server --routers mf --config config.example.yaml"><pre><code>python -m routellm.openai_server --routers mf --config config.example.yaml
</code></pre></div>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>--routers</code> specifies the list of routers available to the server. For instance, here, the server is started with one available router: <code>mf</code> (see below for the list of routers).</li>
<li><code>--config</code> specifies the path to the configuration file for the routers. If unspecified, the server will default to using our best-performing configuration (see <a href="#configuration">Configuration</a> for details).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">For most use-cases, <strong>we recommend the <code>mf</code> router</strong> as we have evaluated it to be very strong and lightweight.</p>
<p dir="auto">When making a request to the server, clients specify the router and cost threshold to use for each request using the <code>model</code> field in the following format <code>router-[ROUTER NAME]-[THRESHOLD]</code>. For instance, using a <code>model</code> of <code>router-mf-0.5</code> specifies that the request should be routed using the <code>mf</code> router with a threshold of 0.5.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Threshold Calibration</h3><a id="user-content-threshold-calibration" aria-label="Permalink: Threshold Calibration" href="#threshold-calibration"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The threshold used for routing controls the cost-quality tradeoff. The range of meaningful thresholds varies depending on the type of router and the queries you receive. Therefore, we recommend calibrating thresholds using a sample of your incoming queries, as well as the % of queries you'd like to route to the stronger model.</p>
<p dir="auto">By default, we support calibrating thresholds based on the public <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmsys/lmsys-arena-human-preference-55k" rel="nofollow">Chatbot Arena dataset</a>. For example, to calibrate the threshold for the <code>mf</code> router such that 50% of calls are routed to the stronger model:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="> python -m routellm.calibrate_threshold --task calibrate --routers mf --strong-model-pct 0.5 --config config.example.yaml
For 50.0% strong model calls for mf, threshold = 0.11593"><pre><code>&gt; python -m routellm.calibrate_threshold --task calibrate --routers mf --strong-model-pct 0.5 --config config.example.yaml
For 50.0% strong model calls for mf, threshold = 0.11593
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This means that the threshold should be set to 0.1881 for the <code>mf</code> router so that approximately 50% of calls are routed to the strong model i.e. using a <code>model</code> field of <code>router-mf-0.1159</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, note that because we calibrate the thresholds based on an existing dataset, the % of calls routed to each model will differ based on the actual queries received. Therefore, we recommend calibrating on a dataset that closely resembles the types of queries you receive.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Evaluation</h2><a id="user-content-evaluation" aria-label="Permalink: Evaluation" href="#evaluation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">RouteLLM also includes a evaluation framework to measure the performance of different routing strategies on benchmarks.</p>
<p dir="auto">To evaluate a router on a benchmark, you can use the following command:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python -m routellm.evals.evaluate --routers random sw_ranking bert --benchmark gsm8k --config config.example.yaml "><pre><code>python -m routellm.evals.evaluate --routers random sw_ranking bert --benchmark gsm8k --config config.example.yaml 
</code></pre></div>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>--routers</code> specifies the list of routers to evaluate, for instance, <code>random</code> and <code>bert</code> in this case.</li>
<li><code>--benchmark</code> specifies the specific benchmark to evaluate the routers on. We currently support: <code>mmlu</code>, <code>gsm8k</code>, and <code>mt-bench</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Evaluation results will be printed to the console. A plot of router performance will also be generated in the current directory (override the path using <code>--output</code>). To avoid recomputing results, the results for a router on a given benchmark is cached by default. This behavior can be overridden by using the <code>--overwrite-cache</code> flag, which takes in a list of routers to overwrite the cache for.</p>
<p dir="auto">The results for all our benchmarks have been cached. For MT Bench, we use the precomputed judgements for the desired model pair. For MMLU and GSM8K, we utilized <a href="https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang">SGLang</a> to compute the results for the desired model pair - the full code for this can be found in the benchmark directories if you would like to evaluate a different model pair.</p>
<p dir="auto">By default, GPT-4 and Mixtral are used as the model pair for evaluation. To modify the model pair used, set them using the <code>--strong-model</code> and <code>--weak-model</code> flags.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Routers</h2><a id="user-content-routers" aria-label="Permalink: Routers" href="#routers"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Out of the box, RouteLLM supports 4 routers trained on the <code>gpt-4-1106-preview</code> and <code>mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1</code> model pair.</p>
<p dir="auto">The full list of routers:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><code>mf</code>: Uses a matrix factorization model trained on the preference data (recommended).</li>
<li><code>sw_ranking</code>: Uses a weighted Elo calculation for routing, where each vote is weighted according to how similar it is to the user's prompt.</li>
<li><code>bert</code>: Uses a BERT classifier trained on the preference data.</li>
<li><code>causal_llm</code>: Uses a LLM-based classifier tuned on the preference data.</li>
<li><code>random</code>: Randomly routes to either model.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">While these routers have been trained on the <code>gpt-4-1106-preview</code> and <code>mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1</code> model pair, we have found that these routers generalize well to other strong and weak model pairs as well. Therefore, you can replace the model pair used for routing without having to retrain these models!</p>
<p dir="auto">For the full details, refer to our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18665" rel="nofollow">paper</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Configuration</h2><a id="user-content-configuration" aria-label="Permalink: Configuration" href="#configuration"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The configuration for routers is specified in either the <code>config</code> argument for <code>Controller</code> or by passing in the path to a YAML file using the <code>--config</code> flag. It is a top-level mapping from router name to the keyword arguments used for router initialization.</p>
<p dir="auto">An example configuration is provided in the <code>config.example.yaml</code> file - it provides the configurations for routers that have trained on Arena data augmented using GPT-4 as a judge. The models and datasets used are all hosted on Hugging Face under the <a href="https://huggingface.co/routellm" rel="nofollow">RouteLLM</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/lmsys" rel="nofollow">LMSYS</a> organizations.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Adding a new router</h3><a id="user-content-adding-a-new-router" aria-label="Permalink: Adding a new router" href="#adding-a-new-router"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To add a new router to RouteLLM, implement the abstract <code>Router</code> class in <code>routers.py</code> and add the new router to the <code>ROUTER_CLS</code> dictionary. Then, you can use immediately the new router in the server or evaluation framework.</p>
<p dir="auto">There is only a single method to implement: <code>calculate_strong_win_rate</code>, which takes in the user prompt and returns the win rate for the strong model conditioned on that given prompt - if this win rate is great than user-specified cost threshold, then the request is routed to the strong model. Otherwise, it is routed to the weak model.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Adding a new benchmark</h3><a id="user-content-adding-a-new-benchmark" aria-label="Permalink: Adding a new benchmark" href="#adding-a-new-benchmark"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To add a new benchmark to RouteLLM, implement the abstract <code>Benchmark</code> class in <code>benchmarks.py</code> and update the <code>evaluate.py</code> module to properly initialize the new benchmark class. Ideally, the results for the benchmark should be precomputed to avoid having to regenerate the results for each evaluation run -- see the existing benchmarks for examples on how to do this.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I came across an <a href="https://www.cooleygo.com/fcc-equipment-authorization-rules/">article</a> from Cooley Go that I wish I had seen sooner. It should be required reading for anyone thinking about making an electronic device, even though the article is specific to the US market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Devices subject to the FCC’s rules cannot be marketed until they have completed testing and, if necessary, have been approved by the FCC. Marketing includes selling or leasing a device, advertising that a device is available for sale or lease, and importing a device for purpose of selling or leasing it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yikes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is possible to market a device without actually selling it. In fact, the FCC has fined companies for displaying unauthorized devices at the CES trade show. These rules apply to all kinds of marketing, including via websites, social media and other online media. The FCC
has not provided any guidance on whether offering a device as a premium on crowdfunding sites constitutes marketing, so there is some risk to doing so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The line about CES, in particular, made my hair stand up.</p>
<p>The testing and certification industry is odd. In theory, it exists to serve the public good and uphold consumer protection laws. On the other hand, its customers are in the private sector. Normally, market forces would dictate that by now it would be straightforward, fast, and affordable to get your product tested as frequently as desired. However, in reality, the labs are “too busy” to respond or reply very late and generally sound less than eager to work with you. Not to mention, the fees that they quote are rarely palatable to a bootstrapping startup. And yet, working with them is generally required to get your product to market.</p>
<p>While some consultants suggest that there are “sales test” exceptions, I remember a person much smarter than me once telling me that “[government agencies] are very unambiguous about [these sorts of things]”.</p>
<p>Variations of the FCC exist in pretty much every developed economy. Putting a poorly tested hardware product on the market immediately puts a target on your back. Maybe you’ll get lucky, but chances are that someone somewhere will report you. And, unless you are operating entirely out of China, it will hurt. A lot. Both your company and maybe even you, personally.</p>
<p>At this point, despair started setting in once more. The way I saw it, I had three options. The first is to give in and pay up. The second is to exclusively sell in countries with weak consumer protection laws. Then there was option number three.</p>
<p>I did not want to spend so much money on testing before I validated the market or gathered a community of believers. The second option made little sense too. So, I started thinking of how to get some kind of sales going while shielding myself from some liability. Then it dawned on me that the Allwinner A20 SoC is the centerpiece of the hardware. It is probably one of the most ubiquitous chips on the market today, and there are countless development boards for it that are already being sold globally. I don’t need to sell the development boards. I just have to tell my customers which boards to buy and how to set them up.
This way, the electronic device liability will fall on the manufacturer, and the magic of <del>friendship</del> EULA should afford me enough protection to make this a pure software play.</p>
<p><em>My significant other would like to take credit here for having suggested this strategy months ago.</em></p>
<p>This just leaves the OS and the software delivery problem. Fortunately, many of these development boards have one important thing in common. All of them can boot from an SD card, which is usually where the manufacturer puts the OS and software. Flashing the SD card correctly is pretty challenging even for me. I can’t imagine a customer figuring it out. So I will flash it for them!</p>
<p>Now, how to get the SD card in the hands of the customer? Mail it to them! Unlike a bigger bulkier board that would have had to be packaged correctly and go through customs, an envelope should theoretically arrive at your door in the same manner as your new credit card. It would also be far easier and cheaper to create a good strong first impression just by using nice stationary. Incidentally, new age digital banks take advantage of this opportunity to create the <em>Wow</em> factor because it is usually the only point of physical contact they will have with their customers. Old age banks just send a boring piece of paper with some glue because they know you will inevitably have to walk into one of their physical branches.</p>
<p>All of this made me reminisce about the beautiful stickers on floppy disks that were succeeded by jewel cases for CDs. I have a feeling that many people long for the physical these days, and it is making a comeback.</p>
<p>Once the SD card is in place, OS and software updates can then be delivered via a file downloaded to a simple USB drive.</p>
<p>The customer would be able to order the SD card from my e-commerce store.</p>
<p>This means that the new goal is to sell as many copies of the OS as I can. Then, count the number of customers from each country. This will tell me which economies’ certifications should be prioritized when I build my own electronic device around the A20 chip.</p>
<p>I can start selling immediately. Or as soon as the OS is ready. Instant market validation and product market fit with minimal spend. I’m excited.</p>

Usually, games and applications are where we find hidden secrets, but during the 1990s, the music industry had a monopoly on all the good ones, thanks to the compact disc, which kicked off a <a href="https://tedium.co/2017/11/09/hidden-tracks-album-history/">hidden track renaissance</a>. As cool as hidden tracks were, the best CD trick was something called a pregap, referring to the space immediately before the first track of an album. It led to numerous innovative ideas—but it also pointed out the risks of going off-spec, as anyone who has ever tried to pull a pregap from a CD-ROM can tell you. Today’s Tedium ponders where pregaps came from and how it became the music industry’s weirdest hiding spot. <em>– Ernie @ Tedium</em></span></p>

<p>As nerdy questions go, you don’t get much nerdier than <a href="https://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/why-do-older-cds-usually-have-a-0-33-second-pregap-before-the-first-track.1178267/">this particular question</a>, asked about a year ago on the Steve Hoffman Music Forums, a popular forum for music nerds and audio engineers. Apparently, the user noticed it when trying to rip CDs using the tool Exact Audio Copy, an application well-known for its ability to rip CDs that other programs can’t.</p>
<p>It may be the most specific question I have found in my near-decade-long history of looking for specific questions.</p>
<p><img data-src="https://images.tedium.co/uploads/ExactAudioCopy.png" width="450" height="353" alt="Exact Audio Copy" src="https://images.tedium.co/uploads/ExactAudioCopy.png"></p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.exactaudiocopy.de/">Exact Audio Copy</a>, the program that exposed the extremely specific pregap hidden on many pre-2000 CDs.</em></p>
<p>This is not something the average person would notice (after all, when was the last time you used a CD that allowed you to go backwards exactly a third of a second?), but it proved a problem in this specific case, because it apparently caused an issue with the user’s external drive:</p>
<blockquote><p>The 32/33 frame pregap has no impact on my built-in drive’s ripping speed in EAC, but does impact the speed of my rips on my external ASUS drive—it seems to spin up to full speed a few seconds into a rip on a CD without this pregap, but doesn’t on ones with, meaning rips take about twice the length.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A commenter on the thread who identified as a professional audio engineer suggested the poster was “agonizing over trivia.” (This engineer will probably throw a chair when he sees this piece.) But honestly, it reflects a truism about disc mastering: Over time, people got better at it. There is speculation that the discs with pregaps were made at one factory over another, which would require speaking to specific engineers who may have left this mortal coil decades ago.</p>
<p>(More recently, the same user asked another very specific question: “<a href="https://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/which-cds-from-the-1980s-were-mastered-using-first-generation-tapes.1198897/">Which CDs from the 1980s were mastered using first generation tapes?</a>”)</p>
<p>The weird part is, he’s not the first person to notice this! About a decade ago, a user <a href="https://hydrogenaud.io/index.php/topic,101115.0.html">on the Hydrogen Audio forums</a> found pregaps on albums as diverse and well-known as Beck’s <em>Mellow Gold</em>, Guns N’ Roses’ <em>Use Your Illusion I &amp; II</em>, Nirvana’s <em>Nevermind</em>, and, um, the score to <em>Schindler’s List</em>. These albums all had a pregap of either 32 or 33 “frames,” with a frame representing a length of <a href="https://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=EAC_and_Cue_Sheets">about 1/75th of a second</a>, per Hydrogen Audio’s Wiki. This apparently is not a specification made up by EAC, but dictated by the Red Book, the compact disc guidebook that sets specifications for the format. According to <a href="https://archive.org/details/cdromhandbook0000unse/page/540/mode/2up"><em>The CD ROM Handbook</em></a>, a 1994 guide to the mastering and setup of compact discs of both audio and digital forms, each of these sectors includes exactly 2,352 bytes of digitized audio data.</p>
<p>To offer a small correction to the original question now that we know we’re talking about 74 frames per second rather than 60 or 100: we are talking about a period of just shy of half a second—a period that most CD players could not access. But the interesting part is that this is actually a shorter period than the format actually suggests, a length of between two and three seconds—an essential separation for data. But over time, it appears that audio CD makers realized that such a gap was not particularly necessary.</p>
<p>These data points obviously do not affect what you’re listening to. You may not even notice them! But small differences in CD length add up when you’re doing things like adding music into a database like <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/">MusicBrainz</a>. Hence why nerds ripping CDs notice things like this!</p>

<p><em>The production of this Willie Nelson album inspired a pregap-related patent filing.</em></p>
<h3>The patent filing that made Willie Nelson a pregap hidden track innovator</h3>
<p><strong>When I say the name “Willie Nelson,”</strong> the phrase that comes to mind is probably “outlaw country.” But I’d like to make the case that Nelson deserves another term tied to his name: “Hidden track innovator.”</p>
<p>It’s true. In 1994, the country legend, between major labels, took a chance on a small indie jazz label called Justice Records for his record <em>Moonlight Becomes You</em>. It was small potatoes compared to the majors he usually worked with, but Nelson rolled with the dice and got a Grammy nomination from it—<a href="https://www.grammy.com/artists/willie-nelson/4954">one of 57 to his name</a>. It’s also an album that you will not find on any streaming service, likely because he chose to work with a small indie label, though the songs are on YouTube if you’re curious.</p>
<p><lite-youtube videoid="LUIokOOT7Z8"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUIokOOT7Z8">Watch on YouTube</a></lite-youtube></p>
<p>The vibe is much more Sinatra-ish than Nelson usually goes, as the above performance of the title track shows. (It’s in the vein of his 1978 album <a href="https://willienelson.com/products/stardust"><em>Stardust</em></a>, a hugely successful record of pop standards that presented Nelson as a master interpreter.) But Nelson happened to be working with a label whose founder had just filed a patent for the pregap hidden track. <a href="https://www.chron.com/entertainment/music/article/album-review-moonlight-becomes-you-4460663.php">And per a <em>Houston Chronicle</em> review</a>, Nelson apparently used it to explain why he went with Justice Records rather than another big label.</p>
<p>Willie’s album was actually produced by the guy who filed the patent, Randall Jamail, with the label’s COO David Thompson, also appearing on some patent filings.</p>
<p>That patent filing, titled “<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US5471443A/en">Method of selectively concealing magneto-optical compact disk data for playback upon demand</a>,” describes a process for “impressing data on the media between the first play location and the begin play point.” (I like sharing patent drawings, but there’s really no point with this one—it’s just a flowchart that describes the process of adding the track, no fun visuals here.) The invention, which the label called Justice Soundboard, was promoted as a big deal by the Houston label.</p>

<p><em>The ambient “Running Man” by the heavy metal band Course of Empire, either the first or second pregap hidden track, based on how you measure this.</em></p>
<p>There was just one problem: A producer in Dallas had actually come up with the technique first, a few months before Jamail. Course of Empire, a heavy metal band signed to Zoo Entertainment (a label best known for bringing the world Tool), had used the exact same technique on their 1993 album <em>Initiation</em>, which had some weirdly hidden tracks, including one buried inside the mono channel on another track, which is kind of insane. </p>
<p>The debate, which <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=QggEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA77">played out in <em>Billboard</em></a> in the spring of 1995, seems to have been the result of weird timing.</p>
<blockquote><p>Castell notes that he was unaware of the Justice Soundboard. However, he insists that he came up with the invention himself months before the fall ’93 Justice planning meetings for the Nelson record, at which the idea for the Soundboard was hatched, according to Jamail.</p>
<p>Castell, like other audio professionals surveyed for this story, is skeptical of the patentability of the feature. In fact, he says it never even occurred to him to file for a patent.</p>
<p>Ironically, Jamail says he also was initially skeptical about the patent-potential of his idea, but proceeded with the application at the urging of his colleague, Thompson, who discovered after a week of research that neither Philips nor Sony—the inventors of the CD—had patented the procedure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Another, unrelated claimant is Electric Light Orchestra, <a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/2298345-Electric-Light-Orchestra-Face-The-Music">which reissued an album</a> with a pregap in 1993. For completeness’ sake: Wikipedia claims another act with an unprintable name, initials A.C., also was early to the trend. However, per my Discogs research, the EP in question was released on vinyl first, then on CD years later. <em>Whew.</em> I didn’t want to have to make this whole section about that band.)</p>
<p>Ultimately, the patent ended up sticking around, which was great for Justice Records, which had to sue Sony and Philips to allow his label to license its technique. Jamail quickly won the case, <a href="https://www.dallasobserver.com/music/waste-not-want-not-6403415">per the <em>Dallas Observer</em></a>.</p>
<p>“This is going to be given to the consumer for free,” Jamail told the alt-weekly. ”I’m going to license Soundboard for pennies a disc, and with CD pricing, there’s room for the record companies to absorb that.”</p>
<p>So, if your favorite record had a hidden pregap track on it, just know that it probably made Justice Records a bunch of money.</p>

<h3>Five interesting details about pregaps</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Technically, every track can have a pregap.</strong> If you want to put some weird audio in the spot between a given track, it’s technically possible to do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/cdromhandbook0000unse/page/568/mode/2up">As <em>The CD ROM Handbook</em> explains</a>, the Red Book spec lets CD-makers add two-second audio pregaps between each track, though they’re optional, as proven by the fact that your favorite albums aren’t loaded with giant pauses. The only pregap that’s actually required is the one directly before the CD.</li>
<li><strong>The first format to hide stuff in the pregap wasn’t an audio CD.</strong> In the early ’90s, Philips bet big on the CD-i format. Thanks to the fact that Philips had directly developed the CD format with Sony, it built some CD-i specific standardization of its own. One of those standards <a href="https://obsoletemedia.org/cd-i-ready/">was the CD-i Ready</a> format, which hid the CD-i data in the pregap area, about two years before Randall Jamail filed for his patent.</li>
<li><strong>Many printing plants won’t press CDs with pregaps.</strong> As we noted in <a href="https://tedium.co/2017/11/09/hidden-tracks-album-history/">our piece</a> on hidden tracks—and first reported by the late publication <a href="https://archive.is/6rRq3"><em>Wondering Sound</em></a> in 2014—They Might Be Giants reportedly faced a lot of drama with their label for using a pregap, because it made printing the CDs harder. These days, hidden pregap tracks are unpopular with CD plants—to the point where plants won’t even consider doing them, <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/From_Demo_to_Delivery/b3hrCIxmkcYC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;pg=PT291&amp;printsec=frontcover">according to mastering engineer Russ Hepworth-Sawyer</a>.</li>
<li><strong>There’s also a thing called a postgap.</strong> Similar to a pregap, these are used as a pause on the CD, but they are specifically used on data CDs to signify the end of the data section. In other words, they represent an actual pause. If you’re running a CD-ROM for a game console (see <a href="https://github.com/sparkletron/PSYQ_Examples/blob/master/psxCDcreate.md">this doc</a> for the PlayStation development platform PSYQ), for instance, you may see a postgap there.</li>
<li><strong>Your CD-R can print pregaps and postgaps.</strong> There’s a terminology used in CD-R software called <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/track-at-once">track-at-once</a> a burning style that effectively adds gaps between different tracks, essentially turning off the laser between burns. This is useful if the disc is a multi-session CD-R, because the postgap allows you to add more tracks later on.</li>

<p><h3>“In fact, most industry experts estimate as many as half of currently installed CD-ROMs won’t be able to play the new discs.”</h3>
</p>
<p><strong>— A <em>Billboard</em> piece from the fall of 1995,</strong> mere months after the magazine was home to the showdown between Justice Records and Course of Empire, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=wg4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA31">discussing the rise of the Enhanced CD</a>, a standard that aimed to bring music albums to the PC and Macintosh. Nothing like a standard that doesn’t work for most people!</p>
</div>
<div>
    
<p><lite-youtube videoid="6XSXmNzDd-g"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XSXmNzDd-g">Watch on YouTube</a></lite-youtube></p>
<p><em>An example of the kind of content you might find on an Enhanced CD, from the Barenaked Ladies’ Shoe Box EP. So, essentially, home videos.</em></p>
<h3>The Enhanced CD highlighted why hidden pregaps were so problematic</h3>
<p>If you bought a CD from a major label in the mid-’90s, odds are it might have included some additional digital stuff for your computer. One band that embraced this strategy was the Barenaked Ladies, whose <em>Shoe Box EP</em> first used the technique in 1995. (Here’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XSXmNzDd-g">a video collection</a> from the CD, with like half an hour of random video content.) These albums, called Enhanced CDs, came with multimedia stuff like music videos, band photos, or even a multimedia experience that leveraged the benefits the format already offered.</p>
<p>BNL found success with the format, replicating the idea again about a year later for its live album <em>Rock Spectacle</em>, which proved the band’s U.S. breakout. The band’s Tyler Stewart, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ygkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA65">speaking to <em>Billboard</em> in November 1996</a>, said the ECD format allowed the live album to better present the band’s on-stage humor to CD buyers.</p>
<p>“We’re lucky that we have the extra dimension of humor,” Stewart said at the time. “Good ECDs are probably more difficult to make if the band is serious.”</p>
<p>The ECD format was a hybrid CD, and the format had Apple’s fingerprints all over it at a time when Apple wasn’t exactly at full strength, thanks to many ECDs utilizing QuickTime. As Josh Warner wrote in the Apple-sponsored <a href="https://wiki.preterhuman.net/images/8/84/Fact.pdf"><em>Enhanced CD Fact Book</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s important to know where you came from to know where you are. Until recently, most multimedia discs targeting the music market were full-blown CD-ROMs, such as <em>Xplora1: Peter Gabriel’s Secret World</em> or <em>JUMP: The David Bowie Interactive CD-ROM</em>. These discs are meant to be played on the CD-ROM drive of your computer. That’s the only way you’ll get at what is important–the multimedia.</p>
<p>Enhanced CDs are different. The primary focus of enhanced CD is the music. The multimedia part is the bonus. For this reason, the name is revealing. It recognizes the format as an enhancement of the popular audio CD, which follows an industry standard referred to as the Red Book. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Enhancement of the popular audio CD” sounds good. There was just one problem: It wasn’t easy to do any of this. It was sort of the Wild West, and it required a lot of experimenting to get right. Warner’s guide described the use of three approaches for making ECDs: The first, a mixed-mode CD, puts data on the first track, threatening to destroy the speakers of any given music fan if they leave the CD on repeat. Warner made it clear this idea was a nonstarter:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mixed-mode enhanced CDs are commonly stickered with an alert like “SKIP TRACK ONE OR ELSE.” Warning labels are OK if you’re a pack of cigarettes, but imagine how artists and record labels feel. That’s why you don’t see very many mixed-mode discs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite this, the format deserves credit for kicking off the trend, with Sarah McLachlan’s <em>The Freedom Sessions</em> often credited as the first Enhanced CD to be released by a mainstream artist. </p>
<p><img data-src="https://images.tedium.co/uploads/Sarah-McLachlan-The-Freedom-Sessions.jpg" width="600" height="530" alt="Sarah Mc Lachlan The Freedom Sessions" src="https://images.tedium.co/uploads/Sarah-McLachlan-The-Freedom-Sessions.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Don’t listen to the first track of Sarah McLachlan’s The Freedom Sessions, believed to be the first Enhanced CD by a mainstream artist. It might bust your speakers. (via <a href="https://www.discogs.com/release/1184942-Sarah-McLachlan-The-Freedom-Sessions">Discogs</a>)</em></p>
<p>One alternative, as you might guess by the topic of this piece, was to shove the data in the pregap, hiding the data layer from the CD player. One problem: Most CD-ROM drives didn’t actually support pregaps, because of course they didn’t.</p>
<p>The final one, which eventually won out, was called a Multisession CD, also known as CD Plus, which essentially treated the two content elements (music and data) as separate parts based on the machine it was in. Unlike the pregap, the data was technically at the <em>end</em> of the CD, rather than the beginning. </p>
<p>“The audio CD player never gets to the interactive data (which now follows the audio session), virtually eliminating the chance for CD Plus discs to play improperly in a regular audio CD player,” Warner wrote.</p>
<p>Problem is, even fewer CD-ROMs supported the multisession format at the time, which required reprogramming the CD-ROMs to look for a secondary data track. This was easy on Apple’s end—they just created a driver to fix this—but the rest of the PC industry clearly was poorly positioned to handle this.</p>
<p>As Enhanced CDs showed, CD-ROMs did not handle gimmicks well. It was either create a substandard user experience from an audio CD standpoint, or know that the CD-ROM portion won’t work in like half of all CD-ROM drives. What a weird thing to invest in!</p>
<p>And even when the ECD format was out in the wild, breaking changes were still occurring at random. BNL, which saw more success with them than most acts, actually had to delay the release of <em>Rock Spectacle</em> by a couple months, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ygkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA65">per <em>Billboard</em></a>, because the disc originally used the pregap Enhanced CD approach. The reason? <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=wQcEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA3">Microsoft inexplicably decided to change</a> how Windows 95 read CDs, making the pregap approach to Enhanced CD entirely useless.</p>
<p>Despite this, the record industry had been quick to paint the Enhanced CDs as the future, with RIAA then-president Hillary Rosen <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=wg4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA44">telling <em>Billboard</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The E-CD targets the nearly 28 million IBM and Mac users, the most rapidly growing consumer lifestyle. E-CD puts us squarely in that market and will ensure our continued leadership in the packaged media for that market.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Continued,” you say? This technology faded pretty quickly in the late ’90s, especially as the internet proved a much better vessel for this kind of tertiary information.</p>
<p>And because they relied on proprietary technology—like Apple’s QuickTime, or executables that only worked on Classic MacOS, Windows 3.1, or Windows 95—it meant that as soon as the record industry got bored with Enhanced CDs (which it eventually did), it meant the information was essentially useless to the average consumer.</p>
<p>It was as if the recording industry was in a huge rush to timestamp music CDs, which at their best can be timeless, as things that go immediately obsolete. They should have just used the pregaps for hidden tracks.</p>
</div>
<div>
    
<p><strong>When the compact disc format</strong> was first released in the early 1980s, it was shared with the industry with a script for how the format should be published and produced. While lengthy, the Red Book was a clear list of standards that any label or mastering plant willing to spend money on that book could take advantage of.</p>
<p>The problem is, the compact disc was capable of more than was allowed under these basic parameters. And as a result, people started to stretch it. Sometimes they filed patents for said stretching.</p>
<p>There was one problem, though: While the compact disc <em>media</em> could be easily modified, the compact disc <em>hardware</em>, which generally didn’t have user-upgradeable firmware unless it was attached to a computer, could not. And that meant there were always significant edge cases that emerged when the discs you used didn’t match the norms.</p>
<p>The pregap was one of the most notable examples of this, but it was far from the most divergent—the <a href="https://tedium.co/2019/09/19/dualdisc-compact-disc-history/">DualDisc</a>, which David Buck wrote about in 2019, was so far afield from the Red Book standard that it couldn’t even call itself a compact disc.</p>
<p>In this light, the pregap, the tiny little area that initially only meant something to audio engineers before becoming the home of Enhanced CDs and artists who felt confined by a 74-minute limit, was an oddity. It was something specified for a specific use on the CD, only for its purpose to morph as people actually got their hands on the idea.</p>
<p>But we love finding secrets—and the pregap gave us another place to look for them.</p>

The study, published in <em><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413124002316?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cell Metabolism</a></em>, offers a comprehensive analysis of chromatin changes across various cell types in both mice and humans, revealing common pathways that govern the transition from youth to old age.</p><p><strong><em>Longevity.Technology: Research into the molecular processes of aging holds significant promise for advancing longevity and improving health outcomes; by dissecting the ways in which gene activity shifts over time, scientists can develop targeted interventions aimed at mitigating age-related diseases and enhancing healthspan. Understanding these underlying mechanisms not only propels geroscientific research, but fosters the development of therapies that can potentially delay or reverse detrimental aging processes.</em></strong></p><h4>Overture and beginners</h4><p>Led by Dr Christian Nefzger, Group Leader, Cellular reprogramming and ageing at UQ, the study employed multi-omic analyses to explore chromatin and transcriptional changes across 22 types of mouse cells, further augmented by existing datasets on human and mouse maturation. The researchers identified a distinct transcription factor binding site (TFBS) signature that is shared between developmental and aging processes, and which is characterized by early-life candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) losing accessibility as organisms mature, while other cCREs gain accessibility through life due to increased levels of Activator Protein 1 (AP-1) [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413124002316?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1</a>].</p><p>Nefzger noted that the mechanisms by which gene activity shifts from birth through adulthood and into old age have remained largely unknown until now.</p><p>“By analyzing molecular datasets from both people and mice and then comparing different age groups over time, we investigated the activity of genes involved in both developmental and ageing processes,” he explained. “Master controller genes regulate which genes are turned on or off in each of our cells, making sure that each cell does its specific job, just as a conductor directs musicians to produce different sounds [<a href="https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2024/06/revealing-master-controller-of-development-and-ageing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2</a>].”</p><h4><strong>AP-1: The Master Regulator</strong></h4><p>AP-1 emerged as a pivotal factor in this research, demonstrating its role in progressively activating adult genes while ‘dialing down’ the activity of early-life genes.</p><p>This activity, shared across various cell types, illustrates a fundamental mechanism of aging, and Dr Marina Naval-Sanchez, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in UQ’s Institute for Molecular Bioscience, added that the study showed this cellular process to be predictable across various life stages as individuals mature.</p><p>“It was ongoing in adulthood, likely because AP-1 is also activated by a number of stress and inflammatory processes as well as by a protein in our blood that increases with age,” she explained. “This further dampens genes most active early in life, which may drive many of the predictable changes of aging [<a href="https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2024/06/revealing-master-controller-of-development-and-ageing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2</a>].”</p><p>The study posits that the redistribution of transcription factors such as AP-1, alongside mild downregulation of cell identity transcription factors, prompts chromatin remodeling that alters developmental and metabolic gene expression [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413124002316?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1</a>]. This mechanism can be triggered by elevated AP-1 activity or depletion of repressive H3K27me3, &nbsp;an epigenetic modification to a DNA packaging protein histone, something that highlights the nuanced interplay of genetic and epigenetic factors in aging.</p><h4>Implications for Age-Related Diseases</h4><p>The research holds potential for addressing age-related diseases such as Alzheimer’s, metabolic disorders, and stroke. Dr Ralph Patrick, also a PDRF in the Institute for Molecular Bioscience, explained that to these diseases, it is essential for researchers to first comprehend the underlying processes that cause bodies to age.</p><p>“By pinpointing AP-1 as a master controller linked to aging across cell types, we can now study the effects of drugs that reduce its activity to extend quality of life,” he said [<a href="https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2024/06/revealing-master-controller-of-development-and-ageing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2</a>]. Targeting AP-1 and its associated pathways could lead to interventions that slow down or even prevent the onset of these diseases, marking a significant advancement in geriatric medicine.</p><p>Nefzger added that the aim is to prevent age-related diseases from escalating or – even better – occurring in the first place by addressing the underlying aging process, thereby enabling people to age in better health.</p><p>By focusing on the fundamental processes that drive aging, researchers aim to develop strategies that enhance healthspan, the period of life spent in good health, rather than merely extending lifespan. As the understanding of aging at the molecular level continues to evolve, future research will likely explore additional transcription factors and regulatory elements involved in this process, hopefully paving the way for innovative therapeutic approaches that address the challenges of aging.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413124002316?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413124002316?via%3Dihub</a><br>[2] <a href="https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2024/06/revealing-master-controller-of-development-and-ageing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.uq.edu.au/news/article/2024/06/revealing-master-controller-of-development-and-ageing</a></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Claims by developers that GitHub Copilot was unlawfully copying their code have largely been dismissed, leaving the engineers for now with just two allegations remaining in their lawsuit against the code warehouse.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/12/github_copilot_copyright_case_narrowed/">class-action suit</a> against GitHub, Microsoft, and OpenAI was filed in America in November 2022, with the plaintiffs claiming the Copilot coding assistant was trained on open source software hosted on GitHub and as such would suggest snippets from those public projects to other programmers without care for licenses – such as providing appropriate credit for the source – thus violating the original creators' intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>Microsoft owns GitHub and uses OpenAI's generative machine-learning technology to power Copilot, which auto-completes source code for engineers as they type out comments, function definitions, and other prompts.</p>

    

<p>Ergo, the plaintiffs are unhappy that, in their view, portions of their copyrighted open source code might be provided – copied, rather – by Copilot to other programmers to use, without due credit given and other requirements of the original licenses honored.</p>

        


        

<p>The case started with 22 claims in all, and over time this has been whittled down as the defending corporations motioned to have the accusations thrown out of court, requests that Judge Jon Tigar has <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/12/github_microsoft_openai_copilot/">mostly</a> sustained.</p>
<p>In an <a target="_blank" href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2024/07/08/github_copilot_dismiss.pdf" rel="nofollow">order</a> [PDF] unsealed on Friday, July 5, Judge Tigar ruled on yet another batch of the plaintiffs' claims, and overall it was a win for GitHub, Microsoft, and OpenAI. Three claims were dismissed as requested and just one allowed to continue. According to a count by Microsoft and GitHub's lawyers, that leaves just two allegations standing in total.</p>

        

<p>The most recently dismissed claims were fairly important, with one pertaining to infringement under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1202">section 1202(b)</a>, which basically says you shouldn't remove without permission crucial "copyright management" information, such as in this context who wrote the code and the terms of use, as licenses tend to dictate.</p>
<p>It was argued in the class-action suit that Copilot was stripping that info out when offering code snippets from people's projects, which in their view would break 1202(b).</p>
<p>The judge disagreed, however, on the grounds that the code suggested by Copilot was not identical enough to the developers' own copyright-protected work, and thus section 1202(b) did not apply. Indeed, last year GitHub <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/09/github_copilot_lawsuit/">was said</a> to have tuned its programming assistant to generate slight variations of ingested training code to prevent its output from being accused of being an exact copy of licensed software.</p>

        

<p>The plaintiffs won't be able to offer a new section 1202(b) DMCA copyright claim as Judge Tigar dismissed the allegation with prejudice.</p>
<p>The anonymous programmers have repeatedly insisted Copilot could, and would, generate code identical to what they had written themselves, which is a key pillar of their lawsuit since there is an identicality requirement for their DMCA claim. However, Judge Tigar earlier ruled the plaintiffs hadn't actually demonstrated instances of this happening, which prompted a dismissal of the claim with a chance to amend it.</p>
<p>The amended complaint argued that unlawful code copying was an inevitability if users flipped Copilot's anti-duplication safety switch to off, and also cited <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07646">a study</a> into AI-generated code in attempt to back up their position that Copilot would plagiarize source, but once again the judge was not convinced that Microsoft's system was ripping off people's work in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>Specifically, the judge cited the study's observation that Copilot reportedly "rarely emits memorized code in benign situations, and most memorization occurs only when the model has been prompted with long code excerpts that are very similar to the training data."</p>
<p>"Accordingly, plaintiffs’ reliance on a study that, at most, holds that Copilot may theoretically be prompted by a user to generate a match to someone else’s code is unpersuasive," he concluded.</p>
<p>The DMCA argument was, as we said, one of three claims just now tossed out. The other two were claims for unjust enrichment and punitive damages, though not with prejudice, meaning it's possible these claims could be amended and resubmitted. Until then, however, that leaves the standing claims at just two: an open source license violation allegation, and a breach of contract complaint that was previously reintroduced after being dismissed initially.</p>
<p>"We firmly believe AI will transform the way the world builds software, leading to increased productivity and most importantly, happier developers," GitHub said in a statement to <em>The Register</em>.</p>
<p>"We are confident that Copilot adheres to applicable laws and we’ve been committed to innovating responsibly with Copilot from the start. We will continue to invest in and advocate for the AI-powered developer experience of the future."</p>
<p>We also approached all parties in the lawsuit and their legal teams.</p>
<h3>Both sides squabble during discovery</h3>
<p>Also filed for the case on Friday was a joint case management <a target="_blank" href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2024/07/08/github_copilot_joint_management.pdf" rel="nofollow">statement</a> [PDF] chock full of various grievances and complaints each side made against the other over the discovery process, with both saying the other hasn't given up all the documents they were supposed to.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs accuse the defendants of deliberately dragging their feet, saying the documents that have been produced so far were already publicly available or should have been disclosed a long time ago. Much of the focus is on Microsoft and its single submitted document so far, something that the plaintiffs say makes no sense.</p>
<p>"That Microsoft employees were involved in many of these GitHub-sourced conversations demonstrates that Microsoft's production of one document thus far has been a function of delay and obfuscation, and nothing else," the anonymous developers said. "Microsoft has known but failed to disclose that its employees were directly involved in the creation, operation, and management of Copilot and its underlying models."</p>

</ul>
<p>The lack of documents from the Windows maker is apparently down to "technical difficulties" in collecting Slack messages, something the plaintiffs aren't convinced by. Similarly, the programmers say that OpenAI should have also submitted lots more information by now, pointing out that it had submitted tens of thousands as a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/21/authors_guild_openai_lawsuit/">defendant</a> in the Authors Guild lawsuit.</p>
<p>Microsoft and GitHub, however, counter that the plaintiffs have been asking for way too much info, accusing them of having "failed to pursue relevant discovery of these topics efficiently and in good faith." One of these topics includes Microsoft's 2018 acquisition of GitHub.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, OpenAI says the plaintiffs haven't been following proper procedure in respect to asking for emails, saying it can't (or won't) produce any until it receives a correct request.</p>
<p>The corporate trio also say that the dismissal of the above DMCA copyright claim has fundamentally changed the case and argue that the scope of discovery should now be narrowed. This is something the plaintiffs dispute on the grounds that the open source license violation claim pertains to pretty much the same documents as the DMCA issue should bring up.</p>
<p>GitHub, Microsoft, and OpenAI say the plaintiffs haven't properly responded to their discovery requests, arguing that their documents include "JSON files, a blank HTML file, emails without any metadata, and improperly redacted PNG files of Slack and other messages."</p>
<p>The plaintiffs have asked for more time for discovery, and although the defendants argue this isn't necessary, the three tech titans say they're open to a "reasonable extension." ®</p>
