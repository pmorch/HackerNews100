	<h2>Harness the Power and Simplicity of Plain Text</h2>

	<p>
		Plain text has been around for decades and it's here to stay. <strong>Monodraw</strong> allows you to easily create text-based art (like diagrams, layouts, flow charts) and visually represent algorithms, data structures, binary formats and more. Because it's all just text, it can be easily embedded almost anywhere. Of course, exporting as images is also supported (PNG and SVG).
	</p>

        <h2><img src="https://monodraw.helftone.com/static/images/diagram-icon.png" width="44px"> Diagrams</h2>
        <p>
          A picture is worth a thousand words. A diagram is probably worth twice as much. Enhance your technical <a href="https://github.com/dguerri/vagrant-ansible-openstack#architecture---network-diagram">documentation</a> (code, specs) with easy to comprehend textual art. Visualisation of data structures, algorithms and data formats plays a crucial role in understanding. You will be reading the code more often than writing it, so why not make it much easier to grasp.

<p>tldr: Apple thinks it is fine. I do not.</p>



<p>On December 28 2023, <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/12604">bugreport 12604</a> was filed in the curl issue tracker. We get a lot issues filed most days so this fact alone was hardly anything out of the ordinary. We read the reports, investigate, ask follow-up questions to see what we can learn and what we need to address.</p>



<p>The title stated of the problem in this case was quite clear: <em><a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/12604">flag –cacert behavior isn’t consistent between macOS and Linux</a></em>, and it was filed by Yuedong Wu.</p>



<p>The friendly reporter showed how the curl version bundled with macOS behaves differently than curl binaries built entirely from open source. Even when running the same curl version on the same macOS machine.</p>



<p>The curl command line option <code><a href="https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#--cacert">--cacert</a></code> provides a way for the user to say to curl that <strong>this is the exact set of CA certificates to trust</strong> when doing the following transfer. If the TLS server cannot provide a certificate that can be verified with that set of certificates, it should fail and return error.</p>



<p>This particular behavior and functionality in curl has been established since many years (this option was added to curl in December 2000) and of course is provided to allow users to know that it communicates with a known and trusted server. A pretty fundamental part of what TLS does really.</p>



<p>When this command line option is used with curl on macOS, <em>the version shipped by Apple</em>, <strong>it seems to fall back and checks the system CA store in case the provided set of CA certs fail the verification</strong>.  A <em>secondary check</em> that was not asked for,  is not documented and plain frankly comes completely by surprise. Therefore, when a user runs the check with a trimmed and dedicated CA cert file, it will not fail if the system CA store contains a cert that can verify the server!</p>



<p>This is a security problem because now<strong> suddenly certificate checks pass that should not pass.</strong></p>



<p>I reported this as a security problem in an email sent to Product Security at Apple on December 29 2023, 08:30 UTC. It’s not a major problem, but it is an issue.</p>



<h2>Apple’s says it is fine</h2>



<p>On March 8, 2024 Apple Product Security responded with their wisdom:</p>



<pre>Hello,

Thank you again for reporting this to us and allowing us time to investigate.

Apple’s version of OpenSSL (LibreSSL) intentionally uses the built-in system trust store as a default source of trust. Because the server certificate can be validated successfully using the built-in system trust store, we don't consider this something that needs to be addressed in our platforms.

Best regards,
KC
Apple Product Security</pre>



<p>Case closed.</p>



<h2>I disagree</h2>



<p>Obviously I think differently. This <em>undocumented feature</em> makes CA cert verification with curl on macOS totally unreliable and inconsistent with documentation. It tricks users.</p>



<p>Be aware.</p>



<p>Since this is not a security vulnerability in the curl version we ship, we have not issued a CVE or anything for this problem. The problem is strictly speaking not even in curl code. It comes with the version of LibreSSL that Apple ships and builds curl to use on their platforms.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>We consider a proposed alternative to quantum gravity, in which the spacetime metric is treated as classical, even while matter fields remain quantum. Consistency of the theory necessarily requires that the metric evolve stochastically. Here, we show that this stochastic behaviour leads to a modification of general relativity at low accelerations.
<br>In the low acceleration regime, the variance in the acceleration produced by the gravitational field is high in comparison to that produced by the Newtonian potential, and acts as an entropic force, causing a deviation from Einstein's theory of general relativity. We show that in this "diffusion regime", the entropic force acts from a gravitational point of view, as if it were a contribution to the matter distribution.
<br>We compute how this modifies the expectation value of the metric via the path integral formalism, and find that an entropic force driven by a stochastic cosmological constant can explain galactic rotation curves without needing to evoke dark matter. We caution that a greater understanding of this effect is needed before conclusions can be drawn, most likely through numerical simulations, and provide a template for computing the deviation from general relativity which serves as an experimental signature of the Brownian motion of spacetime.

As all of you know the reason, it was owe to our professor Dr.Tao Li ’s networking. Among the six reviewers of my paper, four of them are friends of Tao Li. But this paper has very severe issues: the design doesn’t make any sense and the reviewers also pay no attention to it. The paper was accepted at no reason which can make anyone feel guilty in this case.</p><p id="dbae">After the deadline, crazy modifications of the paper were made and I started to make up for the missing experiments. During those experiments, I found that the phenomenon of the experiments and the design was different from what was claimed before, which made this paper doesn’t make any sense from title to characterization and to design. For example, It was claimed that this (the accelerator) is targeted for 3D CNN, which can maximize the performance by changing Diffy architecture to achieve the dynamic control of the temporal delta and spatial delta. But there are too many issues with this. First of all, the Diffy architecture has a serious problem of synchronization. If the width of the input feature is too narrow, the overhead of lane synchronization … . But it was assumed that the temporal dimension of 3D CNN (the maximum is generally 16 and it will decrease with layer) will expand with Diffy. Secondly, it can’t skip zero, because of the synchronization of lane and the incremental of spatial/temporal delta. So if I want to make a change the whole paper need to be rewrite. It is unrealistic to propose a totally new idea before the final version. After I communicated with Tao Li, it turned out that I have to fix the paper by myself. Until today I am still unable to patch up any of those issues. These issues are too obvious which can be easily caught by any experts of accelerator. I have no words to comment that Dr. Li acquiesced to the data which makes no sense.</p><p id="f282">Considering that this will have an impact on my career in the future and my reputation in the area of Computer Architecture, my future life will be worse than death and I will be totally in a dilemma. I considered all the cases, I really can’t work them around. In order to make up for the fault, I decide to suicide. I hope you can learn my lessons and don’t mess around things. We shall never claim too much in the paper before we can really achieve it. I hope this will make a change in this world.</p><p id="83ee">I hope you can keep simple and stay honest in this society.

            <span>Abstract:</span>The rise of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the role of information retrieval (IR) systems in the way to humans accessing information. Due to the isolated architecture and the limited interaction, existing IR systems are unable to fully accommodate the shift from directly providing information to humans to indirectly serving large language models. In this paper, we propose Self-Retrieval, an end-to-end, LLM-driven information retrieval architecture that can fully internalize the required abilities of IR systems into a single LLM and deeply leverage the capabilities of LLMs during IR process. Specifically, Self-retrieval internalizes the corpus to retrieve into a LLM via a natural language indexing architecture. Then the entire retrieval process is redefined as a procedure of document generation and self-assessment, which can be end-to-end executed using a single large language model. Experimental results demonstrate that Self-Retrieval not only significantly outperforms previous retrieval approaches by a large margin, but also can significantly boost the performance of LLM-driven downstream applications like retrieval augumented generation.

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2><a id="user-content-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The recommended way to install <strong>TimeLapze</strong> is through <a href="https://brew.sh/" rel="nofollow">Homebrew</a> cask.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="brew install --cask https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wkaisertexas/ScreenTimeLapse/main/screentimelapse.rb "><pre>brew install --cask https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wkaisertexas/ScreenTimeLapse/main/screentimelapse.rb </pre></div>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Note: once this repo gets <strong>75 stars</strong> and <strong>30 watchers</strong> you will be able to install the app using <code>brew install --cask screentimelapse</code>. Additionally, the application is <strong>not signed</strong> so Apple will give you a scary warning about how the app can not be checked for malware. You can go in system settings to launch it anyways.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Direct Download</h2><a id="user-content-direct-download" aria-label="Permalink: Direct Download" href="#direct-download"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you wish, you can go directly to the <a href="https://github.com/wkaisertexas/ScreenTimeLapse/releases">releases page</a> and download <code>TimeLapze.zip</code>. Both Chrome and Safari give a warning about downloading suspicious files. Ignore then, extract the archive and you should get a <code>ScreenTimeLapse.app</code> file. Move that file into your <code>Applications</code> directory.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Local Development</h2><a id="user-content-local-development" aria-label="Permalink: Local Development" href="#local-development"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To develop TimeLapze locally, you will need to clone and open this repository in XCode.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once that's done, you can use the following commands to run the app locally:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/wkaisertexas/ScreenTimeLapse
cd ScreenTimeLapse
open TimeLapze.xcodeproj"><pre><span>git clone https://github.com/wkaisertexas/ScreenTimeLapse</span>
<span>cd ScreenTimeLapse</span>
<span>open TimeLapze.xcodeproj</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Following this, you need to allow the app to be built for local signining.</p>

<p>Tesla has started shipping its ‘Basecamp’, a $3,000 tent designed for the back of the Cybertruck. It’s a bit of a This disappointment as it looks nothing like what was originally unveiled.</p>



<p>Accessories are big with trucks. Their form factor open up a bunch of interesting possibilities with the bed, but the Cybertruck’s specific design with the angle on the bed makes it more difficult to use some off-the-shelves accessories.</p>



<p>To address that, Tesla has planned a series of accessories designed specifically for the Cybertruck.</p>



<p>One of them is Basecamp, a tent that fits in the back of the electric pickup truck. It was first announced with the original unveiling of the Cybertruck in 2019:</p>

<p>This looked like an interesting design with seemingly a rigid  bottom half that matched the design of the truck.</p>



<p>The product became ‘Basecamp’ and was <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/11/30/teslas-cybertruck-basecamp-is-a-funky-2975-tent-attachment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released for sale</a> shortly after Tesla revealed the production version of the truck last year. It already seemed to be a lot less attractive design at that point:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2000" height="2000" src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/a3w20-cbfas.webp?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/a3w20-cbfas.webp 2000w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/a3w20-cbfas.webp?resize=150,150 150w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/a3w20-cbfas.webp?resize=300,300 300w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/a3w20-cbfas.webp?resize=768,768 768w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/a3w20-cbfas.webp?resize=1024,1024 1024w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/a3w20-cbfas.webp?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/a3w20-cbfas.webp?resize=350,350 350w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/a3w20-cbfas.webp?resize=140,140 140w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/a3w20-cbfas.webp?resize=1000,1000 1000w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/a3w20-cbfas.webp?resize=500,500 500w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/a3w20-cbfas.webp?resize=96,96 96w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"></figure>



<p>Now, Tesla has started shipping, or rather installing, the Basecamp for early Cybertruck owners.</p>



<p>I say “installing” because you need your first installation to happen at a Tesla Service Center to attach the tent’s brakets, which support the base of the tent, to the Cybertruck’s vault side rails.</p>



<p>A Cybertruck owner going by ‘TownBiz’ on <a href="https://www.cybertruckownersclub.com/forum/threads/basecamp-tent-first-review-%E2%9B%BA%EF%B8%8E.12964/">Cybertruck Owners Club</a> received one of the very first Basecamp and gave a first impression review of the tent system:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>‘Although Tesla is requiring SCs to do the initial install, in reality both install and removal of the tent from the bed (aka “vault”) is straightforward as long as you can deadlift 90lbs and/or have a buddy to help lift. Basecamp comes with 6 brackets that attach to the vault’s side rails and have specific spacing. Attaching these brackets is simple: same as how you attach your bottle opener or tie down points that come with Foundation Series trucks. Assuming Tesla is requiring the SC to do it just because of potential liability issues w/ people not putting the brackets in the right positions. That said, the manual provides install instructions for anyone to put these brackets in, so I suspect that one day Tesla may direct ship to customers. The trickiest parts of initial install are setting the stowed Basecamp in the right slot (need to put it in at a slight angle closest to the bed of the truck) and aligning the two T25 bolts that secure Basecamp’s frame to the truck. The manual recommends using a flashlight so you can align the holes and that really does make it pretty easy. Unfortunately the SC installer had some difficulty with this initially and scratched one of my brackets and may have also slightly messed up the threading on that bracket because it’s a little loose – not a show stopper, and theoretically a replaceable part. Once you remove those two T25 bolts, you can take the zipped up Basecamp with frame out of the truck and store it at home. This is welcome news because it definitely cuts into the length of your bed/vault (a bit more than 1/3 closest to the cab of the truck) if you like to transport adult sized mountain bikes using a tailgate pad. Otherwise, as mentioned the design is great because you can store gear under the stowed Basecamp.’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s what the production version of the Basecamp looks like on the Cybertruck:</p>

<p>Obviously, it looks nothing like the original render and arguably, it doesn’t look as good. To be fair, it should look better with the awning out, but they haven’t installed it in this case.</p>



<p>Here’s the inside:</p>

<p>The owner has noted a few issues with the installation, packing, and unpacking process. He is not sure if he can recommend it for $3,000:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Because the rainy weather hasn’t allowed me to do a full setup + takedown more than once, I still can’t definitively say whether or not I recommend the $3K Basecamp. On one hand, I think that much of the thoughtful and unique design elements might warrant the cost: it’s fairly lightweight + easy to install/remove the stowed tent from the truck, stays out of the way (unless you want to transport multiple bikes in the bed), doesn’t reduce range due to decreased aerodynamics, and has intuitive pieces that make setup + takedown a breeze. On the other hand, there are some unpolished areas that stick out because of all those great elements I mentioned already: removing + re-installing the “Aeroflap” and the frustration of fitting and zipping up the stowed Basecamp in softcover after you finish using the tent. The three minor damaged pieces (the scuffed + potentially thread damaged middle bracket where a T25 bolt secures the stowed Basecamp to the bed rail, one of the leg quick release buttons, and the nylon webbing for one of the cobra buckle retainers) that I mentioned might have been better designed and will need to be fixed too, but because they don’t impede the function of the tent they’re not show stoppers. The currently MIA “Tent Mode” is also a bit of a red flag because the rumoured self-levelling element is a pretty big deal for roof-top-tent camping – briefly laying on the sleeping mat while parked in my gently sloped driveway I could feel myself rolling downhill. If Tesla releases Tent Mode to all CT owners or only verified Basecamp owners may be a deciding factor for people buying the Basecamp or waiting for a 3rd party solution (theoretically if a maker creates cross bars for the vault, other folding rooftop tents that are not wider than the vault/bed could work nicely). $3K is a serious chunk of change and you could buy a lot of sweet camping gear with it. However, as I mentioned at the start, evidently $3K for a high quality rooftop tent is not that crazy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The ‘Tent Mode’ is expected to enable an auto leveling of the truck with its air suspension, but the software is nowhere to be found in Cybertrucks right now.</p>



<p>There’s unfortunately no way to link the truck’s AC to the tent with this system.</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>




	<p>In my opinion, this is definitely a disapointment for the price and in comparison to the original renders. </p>



<p>$3,000 is no joke. You can get some awesome tents for that price.</p>



<p>Sounds like you would be better off with an off-truck tent or maybe an off-the-shevel roof tent if you can have some kind of cross bar accessory to make the Cybertruck’s roof flat and able to receive the tent.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="container"><article><p>A simple dice game shines a bit of light on the psychology of regret.</p><figure><img width="700" height="420" src="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/regret-700x420.jpg" alt="" decoding="async" fetchpriority="high"></figure><p>One of the primary motivators of human behavior is avoiding regret. Before the legendary behavioral economists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky formalized prospect theory and loss aversion, they believed that regret avoidance was at the root of the human behaviors they were studying. However, they learned that there are behaviors that regret avoidance could not explain and were led to a broader picture.</p><p>Let’s take a look at a simple game that sheds a bit more light on the psychology of regret.</p><p>I have two dice — one red, one white — and two identical cups. I secretly place one die under each cup (no trickery), mix them up, and ask you to select the cup with the red die. You did not see me put the dice under the cups, so you have absolutely no information on which to base your decision. If you make the right choice, I give you $5. If not, you gain nothing.</p><p>Go ahead and select one of the cups. Let’s say you pick the cup on the right. I slide it toward you but don’t let you look underneath.</p><p>I then ask you if you want to switch to the cup on the left, to change your choice.</p><p>Would you switch? The majority of people do not; about 90 percent do not switch, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01019932" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">according to studies</a>. Personally, I do this experiment with my class and at other presentations, and I have yet to have someone switch when offered the opportunity.</p><p>Why is that? The odds of being right are 50-50, so why not switch?</p><p>Experimenters point to two reasons. First is the endowment effect, which posits that once you perceive ownership of an item, it subtly becomes yours — and it becomes more valuable to you than an equivalent item you do not own. Once you select a cup, it subtly becomes yours — and it becomes more valuable to you than the other cup. Moving the cup so that it is in front of you amplifies this effect, as the cup is moved into your personal space.</p><p>The second reason is that, psychologically, one of the drivers of our actions is our effort to minimize regret. If we make a choice and it turns out to be wrong, we feel bad. But what if we make a choice, switch, and then find out our first decision was actually correct? We feel worse. We know this about ourselves, and so, when presented with the option to switch away from our cup, it is not very enticing to do so.</p><p>We can explore exactly how much worse we feel if we switch and are wrong through a simple experiment.</p><p>In our game, if you pick the cup that has the red die, you win $5. Now let’s say I change the rules slightly. After you’ve made your cup choice, I give you the option of switching to the other cup as usual. But now, if you switch and are correct, you win $6. If you stick with your original choice and are right, you still only get $5. Would you switch now?</p><p>Again, most people would not switch.</p><p>What if I offered you $10 if you switch and win? What about $15?</p><p>Researchers have performed these experiments, and the results are illuminating. At triple the value, 50 percent of people switch. You need to get to 10 times the value before 90 percent of people switch.</p><p>Experiments like this, by the way, are one of the methods that researchers use to figure out how much worse loss aversion makes things feel. This puts it at around three times as bad, which is in line with the two to three times values seen in other experiments.</p><p>When I was in school and taking multiple choice exams, the advice was always to “stick with your first instinct” rather than to change to a different answer. I am now convinced that this advice does not give you a better chance at getting the correct answer — but it does make people feel better than if they get it wrong and find out their original choice was correct. I would much prefer getting it wrong with my first guess than changing away from the right answer!</p><hr><p><em><strong>Geoffrey Engelstein</strong> is an award-winning tabletop game designer who teaches game design at New York University.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          

            <p>In the predawn hours of Sept. 5, 2021, engineers achieved a major milestone in the labs of MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center (PSFC), when a new type of magnet, made from high-temperature superconducting material, achieved a world-record magnetic field strength of 20 tesla for a large-scale magnet. That’s the intensity needed to build a fusion power plant that is expected to produce a net output of power and potentially usher in an era of virtually limitless power production.</p>



<p>The test was immediately declared a success, having met all the criteria established for the design of the new fusion device, dubbed SPARC, for which the magnets are the key enabling technology. Champagne corks popped as the weary team of experimenters, who had labored long and hard to make the achievement possible, celebrated their accomplishment.</p>



<p>But that was far from the end of the process. Over the ensuing months, the team tore apart and inspected the components of the magnet, pored over and analyzed the data from hundreds of instruments that recorded details of the tests, and performed two additional test runs on the same magnet, ultimately pushing it to its breaking point in order to learn the details of any possible failure modes.</p>



<p>All of this work has now culminated in a detailed report by researchers at PSFC and MIT spinout company Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), published in a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=10348035&amp;punumber=77" target="_blank">collection of six peer-reviewed papers</a> in a special edition of the March issue of <em>IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity</em>. Together, the papers describe the design and fabrication of the magnet and the diagnostic equipment needed to evaluate its performance, as well as the lessons learned from the process. Overall, the team found, the predictions and computer modeling were spot-on, verifying that the magnet’s unique design elements could serve as the foundation for a fusion power plant.</p>



<p><strong>Enabling practical fusion power</strong></p>



<p>The successful test of the magnet, says Hitachi America Professor of Engineering Dennis Whyte, who recently stepped down as director of the PSFC, was “the most important thing, in my opinion, in the last 30 years of fusion research.”</p>



<p>Before the Sept. 5 demonstration, the best-available superconducting magnets were powerful enough to potentially achieve fusion energy — but only at sizes and costs that could never be practical or economically viable. Then, when the tests showed the practicality of such a strong magnet at a greatly reduced size, “overnight, it basically changed the cost per watt of a fusion reactor by a factor of almost 40 in one day,” Whyte says.</p>



<p>“Now fusion has a chance,” Whyte adds. Tokamaks, the most widely used design for experimental fusion devices, “have a chance, in my opinion, of being economical because you’ve got a quantum change in your ability, with the known confinement physics rules, about being able to greatly reduce the size and the cost of objects that would make fusion possible.”</p>



<p>The comprehensive data and analysis from the PSFC’s magnet test, as detailed in the six new papers, has demonstrated that plans for a new generation of fusion devices — the one designed by MIT and CFS, as well as similar designs by other commercial fusion companies — are built on a solid foundation in science.</p>



<p><strong>The superconducting breakthrough</strong></p>



<p>Fusion, the process of combining light atoms to form heavier ones, powers the sun and stars, but harnessing that process on Earth has proved to be a daunting challenge, with decades of hard work and many billions of dollars spent on experimental devices. The long-sought, but never yet achieved, goal is to build a fusion power plant that produces more energy than it consumes. Such a power plant could produce electricity without emitting greenhouse gases during operation, and generating very little radioactive waste. Fusion’s fuel, a form of hydrogen that can be derived from seawater, is virtually limitless.</p>



<p>But to make it work requires compressing the fuel at extraordinarily high temperatures and pressures, and since no known material could withstand such temperatures, the fuel must be held in place by extremely powerful magnetic fields. Producing such strong fields requires superconducting magnets, but all previous fusion magnets have been made with a superconducting material that requires frigid temperatures of about 4 degrees above absolute zero (4 kelvins, or -270 degrees Celsius). In the last few years, a newer material nicknamed REBCO, for rare-earth barium copper oxide, was added to fusion magnets, and allows them to operate at 20 kelvins, a temperature that despite being only 16 kelvins warmer, brings significant advantages in terms of material properties and practical engineering.</p>



<p>Taking advantage of this new higher-temperature superconducting material was not just a matter of substituting it in existing magnet designs. Instead, “it was a rework from the ground up of almost all the principles that you use to build superconducting magnets,” Whyte says. The new REBCO material is “extraordinarily different than the previous generation of superconductors. You’re not just going to adapt and replace, you’re actually going to innovate from the ground up.” The new papers in <em>Transactions on Applied Superconductivity</em> describe the details of that redesign process, now that patent protection is in place.</p>



<p><strong>A key innovation: no insulation</strong></p>



<p>One of the dramatic innovations, which had many others in the field skeptical of its chances of success, was the elimination of insulation around the thin, flat ribbons of superconducting tape that formed the magnet. Like virtually all electrical wires, conventional superconducting magnets are fully protected by insulating material to prevent short-circuits between the wires. But in the new magnet, the tape was left completely bare; the engineers relied on REBCO’s much greater conductivity to keep the current flowing through the material.</p>



<p>“When we started this project, in let’s say 2018, the technology of using high-temperature superconductors to build large-scale high-field magnets was in its infancy,” says Zach Hartwig, the Robert N. Noyce Career Development Professor in the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering. Hartwig has a co-appointment at the PSFC and is the head of its engineering group, which led the magnet development project. “The state of the art was small benchtop experiments, not really representative of what it takes to build a full-size thing. Our magnet development project started at benchtop scale and ended up at full scale in a short amount of time,” he adds, noting that the team built a 20,000-pound magnet that produced a steady, even magnetic field of just over 20 tesla — far beyond any such field ever produced at large scale.</p>



<p>“The standard way to build these magnets is you would wind the conductor and you have insulation between the windings, and you need insulation to deal with the high voltages that are generated during off-normal events such as a shutdown.” Eliminating the layers of insulation, he says, “has the advantage of being a low-voltage system. It greatly simplifies the fabrication processes and schedule.” It also leaves more room for other elements, such as more cooling or more structure for strength.</p>



<p>The magnet assembly is a slightly smaller-scale version of the ones that will form the donut-shaped chamber of the SPARC fusion device now being built by CFS in Devens, Massachusetts. It consists of 16 plates, called pancakes, each bearing a spiral winding of the superconducting tape on one side and cooling channels for helium gas on the other.</p>



<p>But the no-insulation design was considered risky, and a lot was riding on the test program. “This was the first magnet at any sufficient scale that really probed what is involved in designing and building and testing a magnet with this so-called no-insulation no-twist technology,” Hartwig says. “It was very much a surprise to the community when we announced that it was a no-insulation coil.”</p>



<p><strong>Pushing to the limit … and beyond</strong></p>



<p>The initial test, described in previous papers, proved that the design and manufacturing process not only worked but was highly stable — something that some researchers had doubted. The next two test runs, also performed in late 2021, then pushed the device to the limit by deliberately creating unstable conditions, including a complete shutoff of incoming power that can lead to a catastrophic overheating. Known as quenching, this is considered a worst-case scenario for the operation of such magnets, with the potential to destroy the equipment.</p>



<p>Part of the mission of the test program, Hartwig says, was “to actually go off and intentionally quench a full-scale magnet, so that we can get the critical data at the right scale and the right conditions to advance the science, to validate the design codes, and then to take the magnet apart and see what went wrong, why did it go wrong, and how do we take the next iteration toward fixing that. … It was a very successful test.”</p>



<p>That final test, which ended with the melting of one corner of one of the 16 pancakes, produced a wealth of new information, Hartwig says. For one thing, they had been using several different computational models to design and predict the performance of various aspects of the magnet’s performance, and for the most part, the models agreed in their overall predictions and were well-validated by the series of tests and real-world measurements. But in predicting the effect of the quench, the model predictions diverged, so it was necessary to get the experimental data to evaluate the models’ validity.</p>



<p>“The highest-fidelity models that we had predicted almost exactly how the magnet would warm up, to what degree it would warm up as it started to quench, and where would the resulting damage to the magnet would be,” he says. As described in detail in one of the new reports, “That test actually told us exactly the physics that was going on, and it told us which models were useful going forward and which to leave by the wayside because they’re not right.”</p>



<p>Whyte says, “Basically we did the worst thing possible to a coil, on purpose, after we had tested all other aspects of the coil performance. And we found that most of the coil survived with no damage,” while one isolated area sustained some melting. “It’s like a few percent of the volume of the coil that got damaged.” And that led to revisions in the design that are expected to prevent such damage in the actual fusion device magnets, even under the most extreme conditions.</p>



<p>Hartwig emphasizes that a major reason the team was able to accomplish such a radical new record-setting magnet design, and get it right the very first time and on a breakneck schedule, was thanks to the deep level of knowledge, expertise, and equipment accumulated over decades of operation of the Alcator C-Mod tokamak, the Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory, and other work carried out at PSFC. “This goes to the heart of the institutional capabilities of a place like this,” he says. “We had the capability, the infrastructure, and the space and the people to do these things under one roof.”</p>



<p>The collaboration with CFS was also key, he says, with MIT and CFS combining the most powerful aspects of an academic institution and private company to do things together that neither could have done on their own. “For example, one of the major contributions from CFS was leveraging the power of a private company to establish and scale up a supply chain at an unprecedented level and timeline for the most critical material in the project: 300 kilometers (186 miles) of high-temperature superconductor, which was procured with rigorous quality control in under a year, and integrated on schedule into the magnet.”</p>



<p>The integration of the two teams, those from MIT and those from CFS, also was crucial to the success, he says. “We thought of ourselves as one team, and that made it possible to do what we did.”</p>

<p><em>A short intro to the philosophy of ethics</em></p>



<p>J.R.R. Tolkien maintained a very private, but very negative opinion of Frank Herbert’s Dune. In <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45433749-tolkien-s-library">Tolkien’s Library</a></em>, entry 964, Tolkien is quoted as having written in an unpublished letter to John Bush, on March 12 1966, “It is impossible for an author still writing to be fair to another author working along the same lines. At least I find it so. In fact I dislike&nbsp;<em>Dune</em>&nbsp;with some intensity, and in that unfortunate case it is much the best and fairest to another author to keep silent and refuse to comment”. Tolkien does not elaborate, leaving the reasons for his intense dislike as an exercise for the reader.</p>



<p>However, when one peers under the hood into the underlying philosophies of the two authors, one can easily imagine the answer: Herbert and Tolkien are exact moral opposites. Tolkien was an avid Deontologist and Dune is pure Consequentialism.</p>



<p>Deontology and Consequentialism are two of the biggest rival camps in ethics. Deontology (from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language">Greek</a>: δέον, ‘obligation, duty’ + λόγος, ‘study’) says “acts are in themselves either good or bad”, whereas Consequentialism says “whether an act is good or bad depends on the consequences”. The central message of Tolkien’s work, hammered again and again and again, is that you should be a deontologist, just be a simple, good person who does charitable and good things, and that evil isn’t the result of being “bad” but rather of being convinced that one can commit small acts of evil that nonetheless work toward a greater good. As Gandalf, speaking with the author’s voice, no doubt, says, “Many that live deserve death. Some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them, Frodo? Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment. Even the very wise cannot see all ends.”</p>



<p>Dune is much the opposite. The Dune saga focuses on the morality of consequence, with the tradeoffs of rule, with the interactions of large and often amoral systems, how a man wields these powers to achieve his goals and how the long-term consequences of his actions determine his ultimate moral worth. “Greatness is a transitory experience. It is never consistent. It depends in part upon the myth-making imagination of humankind.” That is to say, greatness depends on human perspectives; if people perceive something as great, it is great, and that opinion can change over time as morality evolves. We can see already that this morality diverges from Tolkien’s simple, deontological “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_morality">slave morality</a>“, in which greatness does not depend upon the spirit of the times, but rather embodies a spirit that stands the test of time, a prototype of Captain America’s famous “no, you move” monologue. To wit, consider Aragorn’s rather direct opposing quote, “Deeds will not be less valiant because they are unpraised” (RotK). One might argue that Herbert explicitly deconstructs the Tolkeinesque hero embodied in Leto (I) Atreides, whose valiance and refusal to embrace Machiavellian calculus and defy his honor cost him his life. But the moral disagreement between Herbert and Tolkien goes much deeper.</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="1100" height="619" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W8tiH72jD6c?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<p>Though there is no evidence that Tolkien continued to read on in the series (indeed he passed away in 1973, so could not have read beyond the second book, Dune Messiah, though since he disliked the original it would be odd for him to read on), those who have read past the introductory books up to God Emperor of Dune (it was introduced in Dune Messiah, but its full elaboration was only given in GEoD) know about the so-called Golden Path. The Path is, in short, a path to avoid humanity’s extinction. Leto II views the eventual extinction of humanity as something to be avoided at all costs, worthy of all sacrifices, and as such the Golden Path – his plan to so brutally oppress humanity that future humans would go their separate ways and refuse to ever submit themselves again to centralized rule -is pure, unadulterated consequentialism – the ultimate, millennia-long evil, countless acts of barbarity and oppression, to achieve a possible good. As Leto II extols, “I have been called many things: Usurper, Tyrant, Despot. Some even call me the greatest mass murderer in history. They are not entirely wrong. My actions have caused great suffering, and I bear that burden willingly, for I know that the future of humanity depends on it.” In other words, the ends justify the means. And thus the zenith of necessary ends justifies the nadir of abhorrent means. We need not even imagine what Tolkien thought of this: Gandalf (as we mentioned earlier, Tolkien’s surrogate), addresses it: “It is not our part to master all the tides of the world, but to do what is in us for the succor of those years wherein we are set, uprooting the evil in the fields that we know, so that those who live after may have clean earth to till.”</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="1100" height="619" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3srD9Gvl0pI?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<p>The philosophical disagreement between Tolkien and Herbert touches on many more subjects, of course, and another prominent disagreement was that Tolkien was a very devout Catholic and Herbert was not exactly friendly towards religion. Herbert saw religion as an inherently mutable, utilitarian institution, and Herbert was dismissive or even openly antagonistic toward religious truths. In the world of “Dune,” religion serves as a powerful tool for control and manipulation, with institutions like the Bene Gesserit using it to shape political and social outcomes – indeed the central prophecy (that of the <em>Lisan al Gaib</em>) of the original book was a completely artificial contrivance for political machinations of the Bene Gesserit. In contrast, of course, Tolkien saw Christianity as channeling eternal moral truths about kindness and redemption, and his world-building reflects his belief in a higher power and cosmic order, with themes like mercy, sacrifice, and the triumph of hope over despair mirroring his theological perspective.</p>



<p>Religious differences aside, the central argument between the two authors is the moral one. Tolkien is a modernist (or even pre-modernist); Herbert is a post-modernist: Tolkien encourages everyone to follow a single template of goodness; Herbert encourages cynicism and doubt of the institutions that produce templates, and shows the anguish experienced by Paul when he is forced into a template to survive. If one had to summarize these different perspectives in one sentence, Tolkien argues “Strive for goodness, and people will come to call it great”, whereas Herbert argues “strive for greatness, and people will come to call it good”.</p>

<p>After a whirlwind of events, Epic Games says Apple has reinstated their App Store developer account. The move clears the way for Epic to bring its Epic Games Store to the EU, avoiding the App Store structure altogether. The turnaround is somewhat unexpected as Apple seemed to stand by its decision to revoke Epic’s developer account on Wednesday.</p>



<h2 id="h-epic-games-unbanned-again">Epic Games, unbanned again</h2>



<p>Here’s what Epic Games says in a new update to their <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/apple-terminated-epic-s-developer-account">blog post</a> from Wednesday:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Apple has told us and committed to the European Commission that they will reinstate our developer account. This sends a strong signal to developers that the European Commission will act swiftly to enforce the Digital Markets Act and hold gatekeepers accountable. We are moving forward as planned to launch the Epic Games Store and bring Fortnite back to iOS in Europe. Onward!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://twitter.com/timsweeneyepic/status/1766158416093798866?s=61&amp;t=nLf1XlkmJ0WYDBmecUzqWw">added</a> this color on X:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The DMA went through its first major challenge with Apple banning Epic Games Sweden from competing with the App Store, and the DMA just had its first major victory. Following a swift inquiry by the European Commission, Apple notified the Commission and Epic that it would relent and restore our access to bring back Fortnite and launch Epic Games Store in Europe under the DMA law. A big win for European rule of law, for the European Commision, and for the freedom of developers worldwide to speak up. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FreeFortnite?src=hashtag_click">#FreeFortnite</a>!</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-so-what-changed">So what changed?</h2>



<p>The turnaround really is an interesting 48 hours. The brouhaha <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/03/06/epic-games-dev-account-dead/">was loudest on Wednesday</a> when Epic Games announced its EU dev account was being banned in part over a tweet. Epic backed up their claim with private emails between Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, Apple’s Phil Schiller, and legal reps for both firms.</p>



<p>At the time, Apple pointed to a 2020 court decision out of the United States as its basis for terminating Epic’s developer account. Apple maintained that it had no reason to believe Epic Games would not once again violate App Store policy with a new developer account.</p>



<p>So what changed? Apple tells <em>9to5Mac </em>that it has held further discussions with Epic. The result is that Apple has received proper commitment that Epic will play by the rules as legally defined.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Following conversations with Epic, they have committed to follow the rules, including our DMA policies. As a result, Epic Sweden AB has been permitted to re-sign the developer agreement and accepted into the Apple Developer Program.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p dir="auto">This is a little trickier part as the project requires you to set up a webcam in the specific angle at a specific height and distance. Also  stronger the light, better the performance.</p>

<ol dir="auto">
<li>webcam or you can use third-party tools for webcam.</li>
<li>Two A4-sized white paper, horizontally joined together. 2 rectangles need to be drawn at both ends of the paper with a black marker, thicker lines yield better results.</li>
<li>Recommended position for the webcam will be such that it can capture the finger and shadow beneath the finger and should have both boxes we drew on joined paper in the FOV of the camera.
Just like shown in the demo video.</li>
<li>Light source in front, ie. behind the camera would be preferred. Casting sharp shadows.</li>
<li>Hand with all fingers.</li>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>During training the model on your finger, the first window will appear where box will be drawn around the tip of the finger. If the box does not cover complete finger and little surrounding of the finger. Adjust the camera accordingly.</li>
<li>In the training stage, do not move your finger furiously, move it slowly giving out every angle.</li>
<li>While training, during the touched finger state, do press the finger but not too hard. In an untouched finger state, do not touch paper, you can get near paper but not too close. Lift the finger high like you would normally do.</li>
<li>CNN has been used to train over the data, it distinguishes the touched and untouched finger, if the results are not satisfactory, retrain the model.</li>

  A website that allows you to view the investments of America's largest investors.

  This repository holds the front-end code for wallstreetlocal, for the back-end, see <a href="https://github.com/bruhbruhroblox/pinestreetlocal">here</a>.

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Introduction</h3><a id="user-content-introduction" aria-label="Permalink: Introduction" href="#introduction"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) keeps record of every company in the United States. Companies whose holdings surpass $100 million though, are required to file a special type of form: the 13F form. This form, filed quarterly, discloses the filer's holdings, providing transparency into their investment activities and allowing the public and other market participants to monitor them.</p>
<p dir="auto">The problem though, is that these holdings are often cumbersome to access, and valuable analysis is often hidden behind a paywall. Through <strong>wallstreetlocal</strong>, the SEC's 13F filers become more accessible and open.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Large:</strong> With over 850,000 companies archived, any company registered with the SEC can be queried. Download the database <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LT4xiFJkh6YlAPQDcov8YIKqcvevFlEE/view" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Recent Data:</strong> View stocks in aggregation as the back-end collects and organizes holdings from individual filers. With thousands of cached stocks in our database, accurate and recent data is available for any evaluations.</li>
<li><strong>Historical Data:</strong> View individual filings and their holdings in the explorer, or visit the SEC directly.</li>
</ul>
