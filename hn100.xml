<p>I set up my own VPS, documented every step, and ended up with a repeatable
deployment pipeline. This is both a checklist for my future self and a guide for
anyone curious about self-hosting. Along the way I'll explain why I picked
Hetzner and Coolify, and how they compare with other options like DigitalOcean,
AWS, Render, or Fly.io.</p>
<p>This comprehensive checklist covers every essential step for setting up a
secure, production-ready VPS. Each section includes commands, verification
steps, and troubleshooting tips based on real-world experience.</p>
<h2>Pre-Setup Checklist</h2>

<h2>Picking the VPS provider</h2>
<ul>
<li><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M12 6v12"></path><path d="M17.196 9 6.804 15"></path><path d="m6.804 9 10.392 6"></path></svg>Chose <strong>Hetzner Cloud</strong> (cheap, fast, reliable in Europe)</li>
<li><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M12 6v12"></path><path d="M17.196 9 6.804 15"></path><path d="m6.804 9 10.392 6"></path></svg>Alternatives I considered:
<ul>
<li><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M12 6v12"></path><path d="M17.196 9 6.804 15"></path><path d="m6.804 9 10.392 6"></path></svg><strong>DigitalOcean</strong> → smoother onboarding, great docs, slightly more expensive</li>
<li><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M12 6v12"></path><path d="M17.196 9 6.804 15"></path><path d="m6.804 9 10.392 6"></path></svg><strong>AWS Lightsail</strong> → decent for small apps, but tied to AWS ecosystem
(complex for beginners)</li>
<li><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M12 6v12"></path><path d="M17.196 9 6.804 15"></path><path d="m6.804 9 10.392 6"></path></svg><strong>Linode</strong> → reliable, but Hetzner wins on price/performance</li>
<li><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M12 6v12"></path><path d="M17.196 9 6.804 15"></path><path d="m6.804 9 10.392 6"></path></svg><strong>Render/Fly.io</strong> → easier PaaS, but more opinionated and costly at scale</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why Hetzner?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M12 6v12"></path><path d="M17.196 9 6.804 15"></path><path d="m6.804 9 10.392 6"></path></svg>2–3x cheaper for the same specs compared to DO/AWS</li>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>This checklist provides a complete approach to VPS setup and management. This
isn’t just about saving money. It’s about control and understanding. By
self-hosting with Hetzner + Coolify, I built muscle memory for devops that paid
off in confidence and freedom.</p>
<p>If you’ve been meaning to try VPS hosting, consider this a nudge.</p></div></div>]]></description>

        <p>Back in 2009 Tim Berners-Lee drafted a web-specification for "Socially Aware Cloud Storage":</p><blockquote>There is an architecture in which a few existing or Web protocols are gathered together with some glue to make a world wide system in which applications (desktop or web application) can work on top of a layer of commodity read-write storage.<p>Crucial design issues are that principals (users) and groups are identifies by URIs, and so are global in scope, and that elements of storage are access controlled using those global identifiers. The result is that storage becomes a commodity, independent of the application running on it.</p></blockquote><figure><a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/CloudStorage.html"><div><p>Socially aware cloud storage - Design Issues</p><p><img src="https://www.w3.org/favicon.ico" alt=""></p></div><p><img src="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/diagrams/social/simondseconoart-small.png" alt=""></p></a></figure><p>Several of these ideas were going around in the late 2000s, shortly after the explosive growth of "web2" monoliths like Facebook.</p><p>Another spiritually similar idea being championed at the time came from the Opera browser folks who wanted to put <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2009/06/opera-hoping-to-reinvent-the-web-by-making-browser-a-server/">"a web server in your browser"</a>.</p><p>While 'Opera Unite' never fully materialized, Tim's spec got significant traction some years down the road as one privacy crisis after another made the case for stronger web agency self-evident.</p><p>In 2015 Tim &amp; co. <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/news/web-inventor-tim-berners-lees-next-project-platform-gives-users-control-their-data" rel="noreferrer">secured some funding for the Solid Protocol</a>.</p><blockquote>Right now we have the worst of both worlds, in which people not only cannot control their data, but also can’t really use it, due to it being spread across a number of different silo-ed websites. Our goal is to develop a web architecture that gives users ownership over their data, including the freedom to switch to new applications in search of better features, pricing, and policies.”</blockquote><figure><a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/04/tim-berners-lee-inventor-web-plots-radical-overhaul-creation/"><div><p>Tim Berners-Lee, Inventor of the Web, Plots a Radical Overhaul of His Creation</p><p>The creator of the web just received the equivalent of the Nobel Prize for computing.

For example, social networks would still run in the cloud. But you could store your data locally. Alternately, you could choose a different cloud server run by a company or community you trust. <p>You might have different servers for different types of information—for health and fitness data, say—that is completely separate from the one you use for financial records.</p></blockquote><p>To this day, Tim continues to eloquently champion <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/28/why-i-gave-the-world-wide-web-away-for-free">the virtues of the Solid vision</a>.</p><blockquote>We have the technical capability to give that power back to the individual. Solid is an open-source interoperable standard that I and my team developed at MIT more than a decade ago. Apps running on Solid don’t implicitly own your data – they have to request it from you and you choose whether to agree, or not. Rather than being in countless separate places on the internet in the hands of whomever it had been resold to, your data is in one place, controlled by you.<p>Sharing your information in a smart way can also liberate it. Why is your smartwatch writing your biological data to one silo in one format? Why is your credit card writing your financial data to a second silo in a different format? Why are your YouTube comments, Reddit posts, Facebook updates and tweets all stored in different places? Why is the default expectation that you aren’t supposed to be able to look at any of this stuff? <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2009/06/opera-hoping-to-reinvent-the-web-by-making-browser-a-server/">You generate all this data – your actions, your choices, your body, your preferences, your decisions. You should own it. You should be empowered&nbsp;by it.</a></p></blockquote><p>The <a href="https://solidproject.org/">Solid Protocol</a> remains an excellent idea and has even culminated in an official <a href="https://www.w3.org/2024/09/linked-web-storage-wg-charter.html">web specification</a>, but Solid has not yet amounted to any mainstream adoption on the web. Its primary financial sponsor <a href="https://www.inrupt.com/" rel="noreferrer">Inrupt</a> (of which Tim is co-founder &amp; CTO) has focused on the enterprise market as a path to sustainability; it remains to be seen what resources will be directed towards web-scale adoption of Solid.</p><p>Thankfully those of us who want data ownership and agency in our web applications <em>now</em> don't have to wait. <a href="https://atproto.com/" rel="noreferrer">AT Protocol</a> was ushered in by the folks at <a href="https://bsky.social/" rel="noreferrer">Bluesky</a>, now with a network of over 30M people strong and increasingly spread across multiple federated platforms/communities like <a href="https://blackskyweb.xyz/" rel="noreferrer">Blacksky</a> or <a href="https://tangled.org/">Tangled</a>.</p><p>While the respective architectures of the <em>Solid </em>and <em>AT </em>protocols are quite different, they're pointing to the same Open Social Web, re-built on the principles of user-sovereign data storage.</p><p>What web-user sovereignty looks like in practice, from the vantage point of atproto, has been expertly illustrated by <a href="https://danabra.mov/">danabra.mov</a></p><figure><a href="https://overreacted.io/open-social/"><div><p>Open Social — overreacted</p><p>The protocol is the API.</p><p><img src="https://overreacted.io/icon.png?e0852c1e2c7f0e65" alt=""></p></div><p><img src="https://overreacted.io/open-social/opengraph-image?5b0b970dfd19bb8c" alt=""></p></a></figure><blockquote>Notice that Alice’s handle is now <code>@alice.com</code>. It is not allocated by a social media company [like facebook.com/alice]. Rather, her handle is <em>the</em> universal “internet handle”, i.e. a domain. Alice <em>owns</em> the <code>alice.com</code> domain, so she can <em>use it as a handle</em> on any open social app. (On most open social apps, she goes by <code>@alice.com</code>, but for others she wants a distinct disconnected identity, so she owns another handle she’d rather not share.)<p>Bob owns a domain too, even though he isn’t technical. He might not even know what a “domain” is. Bob just thinks of <code>@bob.com</code> as his “internet handle”. Some open social apps will offer you a free subdomain on registration, just like Gmail gives you a free Gmail address, or may offer an extra flow for buying a domain. You’re not locked into your first choice, and can swap to a different domain later.</p><p>(...) With open social, Alice’s data—her posts, likes, follows, etc—<em>is</em> hosted on the web itself. Alongside her personal site, Alice now has a <em>personal repository</em> of her data.</p></blockquote><p>This new paradigm is made technically possible by what the AT protocol refers to as a <a href="https://atproto.wiki/en/wiki/reference/core-architecture/pds" rel="noreferrer">Personal Data Server</a> or PDS for short (what Solid calls a <a href="https://solidproject.org/faq#pod">Pod</a>).</p><p>The notion of a 'PDS' quickly comes off as something very technical and nerdy which is why it's not mentioned once in Dan's explainer, even though it's still targeted at an audience of <em>web nerds</em>. But really the only obscure word here is the <em>Server</em>, which in this context is interchangeable with <em>Storage</em>, as in Personal Data Storage.</p><p>Even regular internet users have some mental model of what personalized data storage entails, especially with the complementary framing of <em>collectively owned and operated</em> data storage.</p><h2 id="data-banking-coops">Data-banking Coops</h2><p>If you're a regular internet user the PDS paradigm won't move your data from the cloud to your personal computer. Most people will still rely on an institutional cloud service, but instead of data-banking with a shareholder-controlled corporation most people’s data can be entrusted to the equivalent of member-owned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_union">credit unions</a> for data storage.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.muni.town/content/images/2025/09/IMG_2977.jpeg" alt="As the economy was transformed by industrialization and then by consumer banking, powerful new players such as Standard Oil, J.P. Morgan, and a handful of others threatened the freedom of citizens. In order to provide a counterweight to these new powers, citizens joined together to form trade unions and cooperative banking institutions, which were federally chartered to represent their members’ interests. These citizen organizations helped balance the economic and social power between large and small players and between employers and worker. The same collective organization is required to move from an individualized asset-based understanding of data control to a collective system based on rights and accountability, with legal standards upheld by a new class of representatives who act as fiduciaries for their members. In the U.S. almost 100 million people are members of credit unions, not-for-profit institutions owned by their members, and already chartered to securely manage their members’ digital data and to represent them in a wide variety of financial transactions, including insurance, investments, and benefits. The question then is, could we apply the same push for citizen power to the area of data rights in the ever-growing digital economy?" loading="lazy" width="1418" height="643" srcset="https://blog.muni.town/content/images/size/w600/2025/09/IMG_2977.jpeg 600w, https://blog.muni.town/content/images/size/w1000/2025/09/IMG_2977.jpeg 1000w, https://blog.muni.town/content/images/2025/09/IMG_2977.jpeg 1418w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Source: </span><a href="https://ide.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Data-Cooperatives-final.pdf" rel="noreferrer"><span>https://ide.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Data-Cooperatives-final.pdf</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>One in every three US adults banks with a Credit Union. Achieving similar or better numbers for data storage is far from inconceivable considering how much our collective experience with Big Banking mirrors that of Big Tech/Social.</p><p>The concept of <a href="https://www.cip.org/blog/data-cooperatives" rel="noreferrer">data cooperatives</a> has already gained a lot of traction in the fediverse with several providers like <a href="https://social.coop/">social.coop</a>, <a href="https://data.coop/">data.coop</a> and <a href="https://cosocial.ca/">cosocial.ca</a> being operational for many years and still going strong. Soon the AT network will have a similarly co-owned institution in <a href="https://northskysocial.com/" rel="noreferrer">Northsky</a>.</p><p>Whether these providers are strictly cooperatives in the formal sense isn't what's most important here though; any suffuciently transparent, democratic and community-oriented data bank (like the aforementioned Blacksky, or the forthcoming Eurosky) is a valid steward and co-creator of an Open Social.</p><p>Data Ownership as a conversation changes when data resides primarily with people-governed institutions rather than corporations. Rather than arguing for what kinds of data we <em>ought to be</em> able to download from the corporate silos, the platforms should be asking us what kinds of data they may copy from <em>our servers</em>, and only with strictly temporary allowances.</p><p>And while the separation of user data and social platform is most fully realized today in the AT network, there are exciting signs of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">cross-pollination happening</a> in the ongoing development of atproto’s predecessor <a href="https://activitypub.rocks/">ActivityPub</a>.

Some implementations of it will be more mainstream than others, but pragmatic data coops can be protocol-agnostic and storage formats are transmutable.</p><p>As long as we have sufficient control of our own data there will always be a way to restart our social graph and digital presence elsewhere in the event of platform collapse.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20250926/?li">https://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20250926/?li</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45479820">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <!-- Left content -->
  <p>My colleagues and friends know that I prefer to communicate
with them via email rather than chat messaging.
There are many benefits in such a choice.
You may want to consider them and adopt the same stance.</p>
<h2 id="unified-inbox">Unified inbox</h2>
<p>My messages arrive in a single program, where I can process and tag them.
With messaging programs I’d have to iterate through Teams, Signal, WhatsApp,
Slack, Viber, FaceTime, LinkedIn, Messenger, Google Meet, Discord,
Mattermost, Instagram, WebEx, and possibly others,
to collect and process the messages sent on each platform.</p>
<h2 id="unified-archive">Unified archive</h2>
<p>Similarly, if I want to find a past message I have exactly one place
to search: my email archive.</p>
<h2 id="long-term-availability">Long term availability</h2>
<p>Companies get out of business or become acquired
and services can easily be discontinued;
for a reminder have a look at the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Discontinued_Google_services">64 services Google has discontinued</a>.
If you ever exchanged messages on ICQ, AIM, MSN Messenger, Skype,
Yahoo! Messenger, Google Hangouts, GChat, BlackBerry Messenger, or Campfire
your messages are now gone.
With email and local message storage
you control the lifetime of your messages
(provided you perform regular backups).
My email archive contains the messages I have
sent and received from 1986 onward.</p>
<h2 id="rich-functionality">Rich functionality</h2>
<p>Email clients offer rich functionality.
In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Thunderbird">Thunderbird</a>
email client, I use the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Folders for categorizing important messages.</li>
<li>Filters to file messages into folders and to avoid some spam.</li>
<li>Send-later functionality to manage message flows.</li>
<li>Tagging messages that require special handling (e.g.&nbsp;pending action,
handle at home, or handle at work).</li>
<li>Address book, with auto-filled salutations in two languages as a custom field.</li>
<li>Macros to automate the signing and sending of attachments.</li>
<li>Sorting of messages through various fields (sender, date, topic).</li>
<li>Sophisticated message search based on arbitrary field contents
and their combinations.</li>
<li>Off-line message processing and composition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some messaging systems offer some of these features, but all
features are certainly not universally available.</p>
<h2 id="single-interface">Single interface</h2>
<p>Having a single messaging interface allows me to invest in becoming
maximally productive in the email client application I’m using.
I can learn its features in-depth,
I can tailor it with plug-ins,
and I can extend it to fit my needs.
When using it (many hours a day)
my mind and muscles memorize how to perform common actions.
With messaging platforms I’d only be able to dabble in each.</p>
<h2 id="asynchronous-communication">Asynchronous communication</h2>
<p>Rather than having
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow</a>
and concentration interrupted by incoming message notifications,
with email I can easily decide when to fetch and process messages.</p>
<h2 id="freedom-from-ads-and-addictive-content">Freedom from ads and addictive content</h2>
<p>Some “free” messaging services serve together with the messages
ads or addictive content, such as short-form videos.
Email clients will only display email messages.</p>
<h2 id="confidentiality">Confidentiality</h2>
<p>Depending on the email provider I choose, I can obtain strong
guarantees on who reads my email messages.
Some, like <a href="https://proton.me/mail">Proton Mail</a> are explicitly
targeting people who want to protect their privacy.
In contrast, many messaging platform will scan my messages
to send me targeted ads or train their AI systems on them.</p>
<h2 id="open-protocols">Open protocols</h2>
<p>Email is transported with open protocols (SMTP, IMAP),
which means I can use any email client and operating system
I want and obtain any functionality I need,
without depending on the business model or whims of the company
controlling a proprietary messaging platform.
I can even develop my own clients, something I have often done
to automate the sending of multi-part email messages to students
or conference committee members.</p>
<h2 id="open-storage-format">Open storage format</h2>
<p>My messages are stored as plain text files in the super-simple
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox">Mbox</a> file format,
which means I can easily process them with other tools,
reliably create backup copies, and
move them from one email client to another.</p>
<p>For example, I have a small script that removes all attachments
from old email messages, allowing me to keep my email archive
in a manageable size.
In other cases I’ve run on my message files scripts to analyze the messages I
send and receive, and I’ve opened them in my editor to fix
hardware-induced corruption.</p>

<p>In short, email can be an amazingly open and reliable environment
that fosters exceptional productivity.
We shouldn’t settle for anything less.</p>

					<h2>Social Cooling is a name for the <em>long-term negative side effects</em> of living in a reputation economy:</h2>
					
					<div>
							<h3>1. A culture of conformity</h3>
							<p>Have you ever hesitated to click&nbsp;on a link because you thought your visit might be logged, and it could look bad?</p>
							<p>More and more people feel this pressure, and they are starting to apply self-censorship.
						</p></div>
				</div>

							<h3>2. A culture of risk-aversion</h3>
							<div><p>When doctors in New York were given scores this had unexpected results.</p><p>
							
							Doctors that tried to help advanced cancer patients had a higher mortality rate, which translated into a lower score.</p></div>
							<p>Doctors that didn't try to help were rewarded with high scores, even though their patients died prematurely.</p>
							<p><em>Rating systems can create unwanted incentives, and increase pressure to conform to a bureaucratic average.</em></p>
						</div>
			<div>
							<h3>3. Increased social rigidity</h3>
							<p>Digital reputation systems are limiting our ability and our will to protest injustice.</p>
							<p>In China each adult citizen is getting a government mandated "<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-34592186">social credit score</a>". This represents how well behaved they are, and is based on crime records,&nbsp;what they say on social media, what they buy,&nbsp;and even the scores of their friends.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span>I</span>t’s not just you. The internet is getting worse, fast. The services we rely on, that we once loved? They’re all turning into piles of shit, all at once. Ask any Facebook user who has to scroll past 10 screens of engagement-bait, AI slop and surveillance ads just to get to one post by the people they are on the service to communicate with. This is infuriating. Frustrating. And, depending on how important those services are to you, <em>terrifying</em>.</p><p>In 2022, I coined a term to describe the sudden-onset platform collapse going on all around us: <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/nov/26/enshittification-macquarie-dictionary-word-of-the-year-explained" data-link-name="in body link">enshittification</a></em>. To my bittersweet satisfaction, that word is doing big&nbsp;numbers. In fact, it has achieved escape velocity. It&nbsp;isn’t&nbsp;just a way to say something got worse. It’s an analysis that explains the way an online service gets worse, how that worsening unfolds, and the contagion that’s causing everything to get worse, all at once.</p><p>This moment we’re living through, this Great Enshittening, is a material phenomenon, much like a disease, with symptoms, a mechanism and an epidemiology. When doctors observe patients who are sick with a novel pathogen, their first order of business is creating a natural history of the disease. This natural history is an ordered catalogue of the disease’s progress: what symptoms do patients exhibit, and in which order?</p><p>Here’s the natural history of enshittification:<br><strong>1</strong> First, platforms are good to their users.<br><strong>2</strong> Then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers.<br><strong>3</strong> Next, they abuse those customers to claw back all the value for themselves – and become a giant pile of shit.</p><p>This pattern is everywhere. Once you learn about it, you’ll start seeing it, too. Take <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/amazon" data-link-name="in body link">Amazon</a>, a company that started out by making it possible to have any book shipped to your door and then became the only game in town for everything else, even as it dodged taxes and filled up with self-immolating crapgadgets and other junk.</p><p>In Jeff Bezos’s original business plan for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/amazon" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Amazon</a>, the company was called Relentless. Critics say that this is a reference to Bezos’s cutthroat competitive instincts, but Bezos always insisted that it was a reference to his company’s relentless commitment to customer service.</p><p>How did Amazon go from a logistics company that got packages to you quickly and efficiently to a behemoth of digital content defined by the Prime experience (which has much less to do with free shipping now and more with everything else)?</p><hr><h2 id="stage-1-good-to-users"><strong>Stage </strong><strong>1: good to </strong><strong>users</strong></h2><p>Amazon started with a large surplus of cash that it was able to allocate to its customers, and allocate it did. The company raised a fortune from early investors, then a larger fortune by listing on the stock market. Then it used that fortune to subsidise many goods, selling them below cost. It also subsidised shipping and offered a no-questions-asked, postage-paid returns policy.</p><p>This offer tempted millions of users to pile on to the platform. Once they were there, Prime membership went a long way to locking them in. Paying for shipping a year in advance is a powerful incentive to do your shopping on Amazon. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of Prime subscribers begin their e-commerce searches on Amazon and, if they find what they’re looking for, don’t shop around for a better deal.</p><p>You can think of Prime as a form of soft lock-in, Amazon binding you to its platform with a silken ribbon. But Amazon’s also got some iron chains in its toolbox. All the audiobooks and movies, and most of the ebooks and emagazines, you buy from Amazon are permanently locked to its platform.</p><p>They are sold with digital rights management (DRM), a form of encryption designed to force you to view or listen using apps that Amazon controls. Break up with Amazon and delete your apps, and you will lose all the media you’ve ever bought from the platform. For a certain kind of reader, listener or movie buff, this is a very high switching cost indeed.</p><p>Amazon has one more trick up its sleeve: after years of selling goods below cost, it has completed the work that big box stores started, eliminating swaths of small, independent, brick-and-mortar businesses. Its online predatory pricing tactics have done the same for much of the e-commerce world.</p><p>That means shopping anywhere other than Amazon has become substantially more inconvenient. These tactics – Prime, DRM and predatory pricing – make it very hard <em>not</em> to shop at Amazon. With users locked in, to proceed with the enshittification playbook,&nbsp;Amazon needed to get its business customers locked in, too.</p><hr><h2 id="stage-2-abusing-users-good-to-businesses"><strong>Stage </strong><strong>2: abusing users, good to business</strong><strong>es</strong></h2><p>Amazon was initially very good to those business customers. It paid full price for their goods, then sold them below cost to its customers. It subsidised returns and customer service, too. It ran a clean search engine, which put the best matches for shoppers’ queries at the top of the page, creating a path to glory merchants could walk merely by selling quality goods at fair prices.</p><p>Then, once those merchants were locked in, Amazon put the screws on them. Amazon brags about this technique, which it calls “the flywheel”. It brings in users with low prices and a large selection. This attracts merchants who are eager to sell to those users. The merchants’ dependence on those customers allows Amazon to extract higher discounts from those merchants, and that brings in more users, which makes the platform even more indispensable for merchants, allowing the company to require even deeper discounts – and around and around the flywheel spins.</p><p>Let’s take a step back. This flywheel is the direct product of a radical legal theory that has had the world in its grip since the late 1970s. From the 1890s until the Jimmy Carter administration, US corporations’ power was blunted by antitrust law, which treated large companies as threats <em>simply because they were large</em>. Once a company is too big to fail, it becomes too big to jail, and then too big to care. Antitrust law was designed to fight that apathy and force companies to care.</p><p>A rival – and frankly terrible – theory of antitrust law says that the only time a government should intervene against a monopolist is when it is sure that the monopolist is using its scale to raise prices or lower quality. This is the consumer welfare standard theory and its premise is that when we find monopolies in the wild, they are almost certainly large and powerful thanks to the quality of their offerings. Any time you find that people all buy the same goods from the same store, you should assume that this is the very best store, selling the very best goods. It would be perverse (goes the theory) for the government to harass companies for being so excellent that everyone loves them.</p><p>It was under this theory that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jimmy-carter" data-link-name="in body link">Jimmy Carter</a> started to remove a few of the Jenga blocks from the antitrust system. Then <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ronald-reagan" data-link-name="in body link">Ronald Reagan</a> came along and tore them out by the fistful. (Most of the rightwing policies for which we remember Reagan <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2023/04/27/much-of-ronald-reagans-presidency-was-foreshadowed-by-jimmy-carters-policies/" data-link-name="in body link">started under Carter</a>, who was hoping to woo conservative voters. He failed.) Every president since – Republican or Democrat – has followed Reagan’s example, up to (but not including) <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden" data-link-name="in body link">Joe Biden</a>.</p><p>The Amazon flywheel is designed to fit neatly into the consumer welfare framework. It proclaims itself to be an enemy to merchants on behalf of consumers. The flywheel is all about lowering prices, and the consumer welfare standard theory prizes low prices above all else.</p><hr><h2 id="stage-3-a-giant-pile-of-shit"><strong>Stage </strong><strong>3: a giant pile of shit</strong></h2><p>Amazon has a myriad of tactics at its disposal for shifting value from business customers to itself, some of which also involve shifting value away from end users, no matter what the cute flywheel pitch says.</p><p>It uses its overview of merchants’ sales, as well as its ability to observe the return addresses on direct shipments from merchants’ contracting factories, to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jun/07/independent-uk-retailers-claim-1bn-damages-against-amazon" data-link-name="in body link">cream off its merchants’ bestselling items and clone them</a>, relegating the original seller to page umpty-million of its search results.</p><p>Amazon also crushes its merchants under a mountain of junk fees pitched as optional but effectively mandatory. Take Prime: a merchant has to give up a huge share of each sale to be included in Prime, and merchants that don’t use Prime are pushed so far down in the search results, they might as well cease to exist.</p><p>Same with <a href="https://sell.amazon.co.uk/fulfilment-by-amazon?ld=SEUKFBAAdGog-Top-Kwds_14921146748_129850349469_kwd-23792740295_e_565464207487_c_sig-Cj0KCQjw_rPGBhCbARIsABjq9cerrKp9B1eCyx3wzgQTJzVZozgQC7258a5neee6dQ9lMOd6qf4PaK4aAgfiEALw_wcB_asret_&amp;amp;id=go_cmp-14921146748_adg-129850349469_ad-565464207487_kwd-23792740295_devc_ext-_prd-" data-link-name="in body link">Fulfilment by Amazon</a>, a “service” in which a merchant sends its items to an Amazon warehouse to be packed and delivered with Amazon’s own inventory. This is far more expensive than comparable (or superior) shipping services from rival logistics companies, and a merchant that ships through one of those rivals is, again, relegated even farther down the search rankings.</p><p>All told, Amazon makes so much money charging merchants to deliver the wares they sell through the platform that its own shipping is fully subsidised. In other words, Amazon gouges its merchants so much that it pays nothing to ship its own goods, which compete directly with those merchants’ goods.</p><p>Here’s where Amazon’s attacks on its merchants’ bottom lines turn into higher prices for its customers. A merchant that pays Amazon through the nose needs to make up the money somewhere. Hypothetically, merchants could eat Amazon’s fees themselves – in other words, if Amazon wants a 10% fee on an item with a 20% profit margin, the seller could split the difference, and settle for a 10% profit.</p><p>But Amazon’s fee isn’t 10%. Add all the junk fees together and an Amazon seller is being screwed out of 45-51 cents on every dollar it earns there. Even if it wanted to absorb the “Amazon tax” on your behalf, it couldn’t. Merchants just don’t make 51% margins.</p><p>So merchants must jack up prices, which they do. A lot. Now, you may have noticed that Amazon’s prices aren’t any higher than the prices that you pay elsewhere. There’s a good reason for that: when merchants raise their prices on Amazon, they are required to raise their prices everywhere else, even on their own direct-sales stores. This arrangement is called most-favoured-nation status, and it’s key to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/sep/26/amazon-antitrust-lawsuit-analysis-big-tech" data-link-name="in body link">US Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust lawsuit against Amazon</a>.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-34">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-34" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>Let the implications of most-favoured nation settle in. If Amazon is taxing merchants 45-51 cents on every dollar they make, and if merchants are hiking their prices everywhere their goods are sold, then it follows you’re paying the Amazon tax no matter where you shop – even the corner mom-and-pop hardware store.</p><p>It gets worse. On average, the first result in an Amazon search is 29% more expensive than the best match for your search. Click any of the top four links on the top of your screen and you’ll pay an average of 25% more than you would for your best match – which, on average, is located 17 places down in an Amazon search result.</p><p>Why does this happen? Because Amazon makes more than <em>$</em><em>50b</em><em>n every year</em> charging merchants for search placement. When you search for a product on Amazon, the top results aren’t the best matches: they’re the matches that pay the highest fees to Amazon to be top of the list.</p><p>Researchers Rory Van Loo and Nikita Aggarwal call this “<a href="https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/3645/" data-link-name="in body link">Amazon’s pricing paradox</a>”. Amazon gets to insist that it has the lowest prices in the business, but no one can find those prices. Instead, we all pay a massive Amazon tax every time we shop there, <em>and</em> the merchants we buy from are paying an Amazon tax, too.</p><p>That means that, on average, the stuff at the top of an Amazon search results page is <em>bad</em>. It’s low-quality, high-priced junk. Even when you’re buying a known quantity, such as a specific brand of AA batteries, the top item will usually be more expensive than the items lower down on the page – the ones without the splashy banners advertising “Best Seller” or “Amazon’s Choice”. The Amazon smile logo gets a lot more sinister when it appears next to a top search result that costs 29% more than the best match for your query, thanks to Amazon’s $50bn-a-year paid search placement.</p><p>Not that you can find lower prices through anything as simple as sorting your search results by price. The merchants that dominate the search listings will play games with quantity to have the result with the lowest price, even if the price per unit is much higher. For example, a four-pack of AAs priced at $3.99 is more expensive per battery than a 16-pack priced at $10 (ie $1 versus $0.63), but sort-by-lowest-price will bury the better deal on the third or fourth page of results.</p><p>This is only the beginning. Amazon has clawed back value from buyers and sellers in many more ways. It underinvests in anti-fraud, so the top-scoring items with the highest user ratings are often terrible but are garlanded with (paid) rave reviews. Merchants with high-quality offerings are faced with two bad options: either they sink to the bottom of the rankings, or they cheat, too. If they <em>do</em> cheat, they’ll have to raise the prices of their merchandise in order to pay for the specialised fraud-as-a-service scum who gin up all those fake reviews. Then, if they get caught, they’ll be banished from Amazon and either go bust or have to start all over again under a new business name.</p><p>But for Amazon, all of this is fine. It’s how its system works, its flywheel. Amazon makes money when you are satisfied, and when you’re furious. The costs are borne by sellers, and by you. Why <em>would</em> the company invest in fighting fraud under those circumstances?</p><p>That’s also why Amazon puts so little effort into policing rotten sellers – and why so many of the “brands” there are consonant-heavy nonsense strings, seemingly generated at random by fly-by-nights that pop up and disappear, then pop up again under a new name.</p><p>This is end-stage enshittification. Amazon locked in its customers, then squeeeeezed, counting on a few good, desperate sellers to keep the system going. Then it clawed value away from its good sellers, leaving behind bad sellers that are a further source of misery for us.</p><p>Now Amazon is in the terminal stage. We’re all still stuck to the platform, but we get less and less value out of it. And because we’re all still there, buying Prime and starting (and ending) our purchase planning with Amazon’s enshittified search results, the merchants who rely on selling to us are stuck there, too, earning less and less from every sale.</p><p>The platform has turned into a pile of shit, and we’re at the bottom of it.</p><hr><p><span>A</span> confession: I am no true believer in markets as the best arbiter of how our society should work, who should be in charge of it and how its productive capacity should be organised. Like other leftists, I am deeply suspicious of capitalism. I understand the temptation to look at all this verbiage about enshittification, throw your hands up and say, “What do you expect? Capitalism always produces crises of production. Enshittification is just a sweary euphemism for capitalism.”</p><p>But this is wrong. There are meaningful differences between the internet as it stands today – the enshitternet – and the old, good internet we once had. The enshitternet is a source of pain, precarity and immiseration for the people we love. The indignities of harassment, scams, disinformation, surveillance, wage theft, extraction and rent-seeking have always been with us, but they were a minor sideshow on the old, good internet and they are the everything and all of the enshitternet.</p><p>This has real, material consequences for our comrades in the struggle for a better world. The internet that spawned <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/occupy" data-link-name="in body link">Occupy</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement" data-link-name="in body link">Black Lives Matter </a>has become hostile to the maintenance of radical political movements and is inimical to the founding of new ones. That really matters. Not because the internet is the most important issue facing us today. Far from it. Compared with the climate emergency, genocide, inequality, corruption, democratic backsliding, authoritarianism and sustained racist, homophobic, misogynist and transphobic attacks, the internet is just a sideshow. But the internet is the terrain upon which these fights will be waged. It is the communications medium we will use to organise to save our species and planet from their imminent eradication. We can’t win these fights without a free, fair and open internet.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/18/my-hero-audre-lorde-jackie-kay" data-link-name="in body link">Audre Lorde</a> was far smarter than I am about nearly everything, but when she wrote, “<a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/audre-lorde-the-master-s-tools-will-never-dismantle-the-master-s-house" data-link-name="in body link">The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house</a>”, she was manifestly wrong. The master’s tools were used to build that house in the first place – that makes them the ideal tools to take it to bits and rebuild it to shelter us.</p><p>We can halt the creeping enshittification of every digital device. We can build a better, enshittification-resistant digital nervous system, one fit to coordinate the mass movements we will need to fight fascism, end genocide and save our planet and our species.</p><figure id="d30261f5-99f3-45df-9c5e-0edbb4e70d5f" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:54,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;‘My house filled with stuff while my bank account drained’: how I stopped impulse buying&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;d30261f5-99f3-45df-9c5e-0edbb4e70d5f&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/feb/27/how-to-stop-impulse-buying&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:10,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0}}"></gu-island></figure><p>You won’t be able to do it alone. Your personal consumption choices might make a difference to the merchants you patronise, but they have no effect on the policies that created our enshittogenic environment. Just as you can’t save the planet by diligently sorting your recycling, you can’t stop enshittification by “voting with your wallet” (those votes are always won by those with the thickest wallets, and that’s the billionaires who made money by enshittifying everything).</p><p>Take Amazon: to fix Amazon, we need policy solutions. We need to ban predatory pricing – selling goods below cost to keep competitors out of the market (and then jacking them up again). We need to impose structural separation on the company so it can either be a platform, or compete with the sellers that rely on it as a platform. We need to curb its junk fees, which suck 45-51 cents on every dollar merchants take in. We need to end its most favoured nation deal, which forces merchants who raise their prices on Amazon to pay these fees to raise their prices everywhere else, too. We need to unionise its drivers and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/amazon-diaries" data-link-name="in body link">warehouse workers</a>. We need to treat its rigged search results as the fraud they are.</p><p>The path to a better Amazon doesn’t lie through consumer activism, or appeals to the its conscience. Corporations, being artificial, immortal colony-organisms that use humans as their inconvenient gut flora, do not have consciences to appeal to. The path leads through coalitions: of consumers and merchants who are tired of being robbed; of workers who are tired of being immiserated and maimed; of competitors who are tired of being strong-armed by a monopolist bully; of tax-justice activists who are tired of trillion-dollar multinationals ducking their obligations. Systemic problems have systemic solutions, not individual ones. You can’t shop your way out of a monopoly.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/martin-luther-king" data-link-name="in body link">Martin Luther King Jr </a>once said, “It may be true that the law cannot make a man love me, but it can stop him from lynching me, and I think that’s pretty important, also.”</p><p>It may be true that regulation can’t force corporate sociopaths to conceive of you as a human being entitled to dignity and fair treatment, and not just an ambulatory wallet, a supply of gut bacteria for the immortal colony organism that is a limited liability corporation. But it can make that exec fear you enough to treat you fairly and afford you dignity, even if he doesn’t think you deserve it. And I think that’s pretty important.</p><p><span data-dcr-style="bullet"></span> This is an edited extract from Enshittification: Why Everything Suddenly Got Worse and What to Do About It by Cory Doctorow, published by Verso at £22 on 14 October.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>Today, we’re introducing new capabilities for managing your agents’ context on the Claude Developer Platform: context editing and the memory tool.</p><p>With our latest model, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claude Sonnet 4.5</a>, these capabilities enable developers to build AI agents capable of handling long-running tasks at higher performance and without hitting context limits or losing critical information.</p><h2 id="context-windows-have-limits-but-real-work-doesnt">Context windows have limits, but real work doesn’t</h2><p>As production agents handle more complex tasks and generate more tool results, they often exhaust their effective context windows—leaving developers stuck choosing between cutting agent transcripts or degrading performance. Context management solves this in two ways, helping developers ensure only relevant data stays in context and valuable insights get preserved across sessions.</p><p><strong>Context editing</strong> automatically clears stale tool calls and results from within the context window when approaching token limits. As your agent executes tasks and accumulates tool results, context editing removes stale content while preserving the conversation flow, effectively extending how long agents can run without manual intervention. This also increases the effective model performance as Claude focuses only on relevant context.</p><div><figure><img alt="Visualization comparing available context before context editing and after context editing." loading="lazy" width="1920" height="800" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F8ad2952bc0513750088cdfd309ee83ba0fd15438-1920x800.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F8ad2952bc0513750088cdfd309ee83ba0fd15438-1920x800.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F8ad2952bc0513750088cdfd309ee83ba0fd15438-1920x800.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure></div><p><strong>The memory tool</strong> enables Claude to store and consult information outside the context window through a file-based system. Claude can create, read, update, and delete files in a dedicated memory directory stored in your infrastructure that persists across conversations. This allows agents to build up knowledge bases over time, maintain project state across sessions, and reference previous learnings without having to keep everything in context.</p><p>The memory tool operates entirely client-side through tool calls. Developers manage the storage backend, giving them complete control over where the data is stored and how it’s persisted.</p><p>Claude Sonnet 4.5 enhances both capabilities with built-in context awareness—tracking available tokens throughout conversations to manage context more effectively.</p><p>Together, these updates create a system that improves agent performance:</p><ul><li>Enable longer conversations by automatically removing stale tool results from context</li><li>Boost accuracy by saving critical information to memory—and bring that learning across successive agentic sessions</li></ul><h2 id="building-long-running-agents">Building long-running agents</h2><p>Claude Sonnet 4.5 is the best model in the world for building agents. These features unlock new possibilities for long-running agents—processing entire codebases, analyzing hundreds of documents, or maintaining extensive tool interaction histories. Context management builds on this foundation, ensuring agents can leverage this expanded capacity efficiently while still handling workflows that extend beyond any fixed limit. Use cases include:</p><ul><li><strong>Coding:</strong> Context editing clears old file reads and test results while memory preserves debugging insights and architectural decisions, enabling agents to work on large codebases without losing progress.</li><li><strong>Research: </strong>Memory stores key findings while context editing removes old search results, building knowledge bases that improve performance over time.</li><li><strong>Data processing: </strong>Agents store intermediate results in memory while context editing clears raw data, handling workflows that would otherwise exceed token limits.</li></ul><h2 id="performance-improvements-with-context-management">Performance improvements with context management</h2><p>On an internal evaluation set for agentic search, we tested how context management improves agent performance on complex, multi-step tasks. The results demonstrate significant gains: combining the memory tool with context editing improved performance by 39% over baseline. Context editing alone delivered a 29% improvement.</p><p>In a 100-turn web search evaluation, context editing enabled agents to complete workflows that would otherwise fail due to context exhaustion—while reducing token consumption by 84%.</p><h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2><p>These capabilities are available today in public beta on the Claude Developer Platform, natively and in Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud’s Vertex AI.

<p>Today, 43% of U.S. adults say the fact that sports betting is now legal in much of the country is a <strong>bad thing for society. </strong>That’s up from <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/09/14/as-more-states-legalize-the-practice-19-of-u-s-adults-say-they-have-bet-money-on-sports-in-the-past-year/">34% in 2022</a>. And 40% of adults now say it’s a <strong>bad thing for sports,</strong> up from 33%.</p>



<p>Despite these increasingly critical views of legal sports betting, many Americans continue to say it has neither a bad nor good impact on society and on sports. Fewer than one-in-five see positive impacts.</p>



<details><summary>About this research</summary>
<p>This Pew Research Center analysis examines recent changes in Americans’ awareness of, attitudes about and personal experiences with sports betting. It comes as more states <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/events/details/sports-betting-on-the-rise-as-states-let-gamblers-wager-online">legalize the practice</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the share of Americans who have bet money on sports in the past year has not changed much since 2022.</p>



<p>Today, 22% of adults say they’ve<strong> personally bet money on sports in the past year.</strong> That’s a slight uptick from 19% three years ago. This figure includes betting in any of three ways:</p>



<ul>
<li>With friends or family, such as in a private betting pool, fantasy league or casual bet</li>



<li>Online with a betting app, sportsbook or casino</li>



<li>In person at a casino, racetrack or betting kiosk</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this increase has come through <strong>online sports betting:</strong> 10% of adults now say they’ve placed a bet this way in the past year, up from 6% in 2022. There has been no change in the shares of adults who have bet on sports with family or friends or in person at a casino, racetrack or betting kiosk.</p>



<p>Commercial sports betting has spread rapidly across the United States since a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/us/politics/supreme-court-sports-betting-new-jersey.html">Supreme Court ruling in 2018</a> gave states the green light to legalize it. At least 38 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico now allow commercial sports betting in some form, <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/events/details/sports-betting-on-the-rise-as-states-let-gamblers-wager-online">according to the National Conference of State Legislatures</a>.</p>



<p>In our new survey, 63% of adults say they’ve heard or read a lot or a little about the fact that sports betting is now legal in much of the U.S. That’s up from 56% in 2022. The increase in public awareness comes as betting-related advertisements <a href="https://www.espn.com/espn/betting/story/_/id/44716101/sports-betting-ads-tv-versus-alcohol-study-fantasy-spending-volume">have become common during sports broadcasts</a>.</p>



<p>The rest of this analysis takes a closer look at Americans’ views of and experiences with sports betting. It’s based on the survey of 9,916 U.S. adults, conducted in July and August.</p>

<p>Since 2022, Americans in many demographic groups have become more likely to view the widespread legalization of sports betting as a bad thing for society, as well as for sports.</p>



<p>This is true for men and women; college graduates and non-college graduates; and upper-, middle- and lower-income Americans alike. It is also the case among Democrats and Republicans, as well as among those who have personally placed a sports bet in the past year and those who have not.</p>



<p>Some of the biggest shifts in attitudes about sports betting’s societal impact have come among young Americans – especially young men. <strong>Today, 47% of men under 30 say legal sports betting is a bad thing for society, up from 22% who said this in 2022.</strong> Women under 30 have also become more likely to express this view: 35% see legal sports betting as bad for society, up from 25% three years ago.</p>



<p>The legalization of sports betting has <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/state/sports-betting-tax-revenue/">generated revenue for state governments and gambling operators</a>, but it has also raised concerns about <a href="https://www.ncpgambling.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Sports-gambling_NCPGLitRvwExecSummary.pdf">gambling addiction</a> and other societal harms. Critics have also cautioned that it may <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2025/08/bad-bets-the-new-culture-of-sports-gambling/">compromise the integrity of sports</a>. In recent years, several professional and college athletes and team personnel have been punished for violating betting rules.</p>



<details><summary>Recent betting violations in professional sports</summary>
<p>The largest professional sports leagues in North America – including the National Football League (NFL), Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Hockey League (NHL) and Major League Soccer (MLS) – ban players, and often coaches and other personnel, from betting on their own sports. In some cases, there are also rules about betting on <em>other</em> sports. Punishments for violating the rules range from fines or suspensions to lifetime bans.</p>



<p>Since the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/us/politics/supreme-court-sports-betting-new-jersey.html">U.S. Supreme Court’s 2018 decision to allow sports betting</a>, at least 20 professional athletes in these five leagues – as well as one NFL coach and one MLB umpire – have faced disciplinary action for violating their leagues’ gambling policies. All but four of these disciplinary actions took place in 2023 and 2024, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of league announcements and media reports.</p>



<p>More than half of the athletes who have faced disciplinary action (11 of 20) were from the NFL. The rest involved players from MLB (five), MLS (two), the NBA (one) and the NHL (one).</p>



<p>In most cases, players received suspensions, ranging from several games to indefinite. However, in 2024, an <a href="https://abc7news.com/post/tucupita-marcano-gets-lifetime-mlb-ban-betting-baseball/14909938/">MLB player</a> and an <a href="https://www.nba.com/news/jontay-porter-banned-from-nba">NBA player</a> each received permanent bans for betting on their own teams’ games.</p>

<p>As was the case in 2022, some groups of Americans are more likely than others to say they’ve personally bet money on sports in the past year in any of the ways we asked about.</p>



<p><strong>Young adults are more likely than older Americans to say they’ve placed a sports bet in the past year.</strong> Some 31% of adults under 30 say this, including 36% of men and 29% of women in this age group. Sports betting is less common in all older age groups.</p>



<p><strong>Black and Hispanic adults are also especially likely to have bet money on sports in the past year:</strong> 30% and 27%, respectively, say they have done so. Roughly two-in-ten Asian (22%) and White (19%) adults say the same.</p>



<p>There are no differences between college graduates and non-college graduates on this question. In each group, 22% say they have bet on sports in the past year. Nor are there major partisan differences: 24% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they have done so, as have 22% of Republicans and Republican leaners.</p>



<h4 id="who-has-placed-an-online-sports-bet-in-the-past-year">Who has placed an online sports bet in the past year?</h4>



<p>When it comes to <em>online </em>sports betting, young adults and Black Americans again stand out.</p>



<p>Overall, 17% of adults under 30 – including 21% of men and 16% of women in this age group – say they’ve placed an online sports wager in the past year. Three years ago, 7% of those under 30 had done so – including 9% of men and 6% of women.</p>



<p>Among Black adults, 19% say they’ve placed an online sports bet in the past year, up from 10% in 2022. Smaller shares of Hispanic (12%), Asian (11%) and White (8%) adults say they’ve done this in the past year.</p>

<h2>2025.10.04: NSA and IETF: <span>Can an attacker simply purchase standardization of weakened cryptography? #pqcrypto #hybrids #nsa #ietf #antitrust</span></h2>
<p>It's normal for post-quantum cryptography
to be rolled out as an <em>extra</em> layer of security on top of traditional pre-quantum cryptography,
rather than as a <em>replacement</em>.</p>
<p>For example,
Google's <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2016/07/experimenting-with-post-quantum.html">CECPQ1</a> experiment
was double encryption with
traditional pre-quantum ECC
(specifically
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/papers.html#safecurves">X25519</a>)
and post-quantum NewHope1024.
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-tls-post-quantum-experiment/">CECPQ2</a>,
a joint experiment between Google and Cloudflare,
was ECC+NTRUHRSS701.
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-tls-post-quantum-experiment/">CECPQ2b</a>
was ECC+SIKEp434.
<a href="https://ssh-comparison.quendi.de/comparison/kex.html">Ten SSH implementations</a>
support ECC+sntrup761.
Today's usage of post-quantum cryptography by browsers is
<a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage#post-quantum-encryption-adoption">approaching half</a>
of the connections seen by Cloudflare,
where
<a href="https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/vtMTuE_3u-0/m/k6JisLwXAQAJ">95% of that</a>
is ECC+MLKEM768
and 5% is ECC+Kyber768.</p>
<p>If post-quantum cryptography is designed to be super-strong,
so strong that it even survives future quantum computers,
then why are we keeping the ECC layer?
Same reason that you wear your seatbelt:
in the real world, cars sometimes crash, and seatbelts reduce the damage.</p>
<p>Google already explained this back in
<a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2016/07/experimenting-with-post-quantum.html">2016</a>:
"The post-quantum algorithm might turn out to be breakable even with today's computers,
in which case the elliptic-curve algorithm will still provide the best security that today's technology can offer."
We've seen
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/papers.html#qrcsp">many breaks of post-quantum proposals</a>
since then,
including the sudden
<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/975">public</a>
<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1026">collapse</a>
of SIKE
three years after CECPQ2b applied SIKE to
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-tls-post-quantum-experiment/">tens of millions</a> of user connections.
The <em>only</em> reason that this user data wasn't immediately exposed to attackers
is that CECPQ2b encrypted data with SIKE <em>and</em> with ECC,
rather than switching from ECC to just SIKE.
As another example,
the reference Kyber/ML-KEM software went through two rounds of security patches for
<a href="https://kyberslash.cr.yp.to/">KyberSlash</a> at the end of 2023,
and then had
<a href="https://pqshield.com/pqshield-plugs-timing-leaks-in-kyber-ml-kem-to-improve-pqc-implementation-maturity/">another security patch</a>
in mid-2024.</p>
<p>Deploying ECC+PQ rather than just PQ is an easy common-sense win.
ECC software is practically everywhere anyway,
and nobody has identified an application that can afford PQ without being able to afford ECC+PQ.</p>
<p>Typically people talk about deploying ECC+PQ as deploying "hybrids" rather than "non-hybrids",
although you have to be careful with this terminology
since the word "hybrid" also has other meanings in cryptography.
It's more descriptive to talk about
"double encryption" and "double signatures"
rather than
"single encryption" and "single signatures".</p>

are trying to have standards-development organizations
endorse weakening ECC+PQ down to just PQ.</p>
<p>Part of this is that
NSA and GCHQ have been endlessly repeating arguments that this weakening is a <em>good</em> thing
(in much the same way that NSA advertised
<a href="https://projectbullrun.org/dual-ec/index.html">Dual EC</a>
as providing
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250902084755/https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/events/random-number-generation-workshop-2004/documents/numbertheoreticdrbg.pdf">"increased assurance"</a>).
I have a previous blog post showing that
those arguments <a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20240102-hybrid.html">collapse upon examination</a>.
But that's not today's topic.
In today's blog post I'm instead looking at
how easy it is for NSA to simply spend money to corrupt the standardization process.</p>
<p><strong><a name="tls">Two TLS encryption drafts.</a></strong>
For concreteness,
I'll focus on what's happening in a particular standards-development organization
called the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
Within that,
I'll focus on current proposals within an IETF "working group" (WG)
that sets standards for Transport Layer Security (TLS),
the security layer inside HTTPS and inside various other protocols.
I'll look specifically at how the TLS WG handled
two drafts specifying post-quantum encryption mechanisms for TLS:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hybrid (double encryption):
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250710085814/https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-kwiatkowski-tls-ecdhe-mlkem-03.html">"Post-quantum hybrid ECDHE-MLKEM Key Agreement for TLSv1.3"</a>.
  This draft specifies ECC+PQ in TLS,
  specifically usage in TLS of "X25519MLKEM768, SecP256r1MLKEM768, and SecP384r1MLKEM1024".
  The first of those is also what I mentioned above as
  <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/vtMTuE_3u-0/m/k6JisLwXAQAJ">95%</a>
  of current post-quantum connections to Cloudflare.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-hybrid (single encryption):
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250718131345/https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-connolly-tls-mlkem-key-agreement-05.html">"ML-KEM Post-Quantum Key Agreement for TLS 1.3"</a>.
  This draft specifies usage in TLS of "ML-KEM-512, ML-KEM-768, and ML-KEM-1024" without seatbelts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The non-hybrid draft was first posted in March 2024.
Of course someone asked "what the motivation is for being 'fully post-quantum' rather than hybrid".
The draft author
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/qFRxBSnEPJcdlt7MO0cIL2kW5qc/">responded</a>:
"FIPS / CNSA 2.0 compliance guidelines ...
currently are a big 'maybe' at best for 'hybrid solutions', and the
timetables for compliant browsers, servers, and services are to exclusively
use FIPS 203 at level V (ML-KEM-1024) by 2033. I figure there will be
demand for pure ML-KEM key agreement, not hybrid (with no questions that
come along with it of whether it's actually allowed or not)."</p>
<p>As context,
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_the_United_States">massive U.S. military budget</a>
now publicly requires cryptographic "components" to have
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221022163808/https://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/Library/Instructions/CJCSI%206510.02F.pdf?ver=qUEnOsWpGPcGGMFTb4yYVA%3D%3D">NSA approval</a>.
"CNSA 2.0" refers to a public NSA document
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240927153634/https://media.defense.gov/2022/Sep/07/2003071834/-1/-1/0/CSA_CNSA_2.0_ALGORITHMS_.PDF">"Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite 2.0"</a>.
The document says up front that its requirements apply to
"all NSS use of public cryptographic algorithms (as opposed to algorithms NSA developed),
including those on all unclassified and classified NSS".
The <a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/us/title-40/subtitle-iii/chapter-111/sec-11103/">legal definition</a>
of "national security system" (NSS)
covers practically all military information systems,
except for "routine administrative and business applications" such as "payroll".</p>
<p>In June 2024,
NSA's William Layton
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/ESCdYNwVeF4VkvoORFJLJk_87VU/">wrote</a>
that "we do not anticipate supporting hybrid in NSS".</p>
<p>In December 2024, a Cisco employee
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/S9Mwv28VEHrG189ZtoubUani7J8/">wrote</a>
the following:
"There are people whose
cryptographic expertise I cannot doubt who say that pure ML-KEM is the
right trade-off for them, and more importantly for my employer, that's
what they're willing to buy.  Hence, Cisco will implement it; I am
essentially just asking for code points."
Certainly "willing to buy" is a statement about funding,
evidently from a source large enough to dictate Cisco actions,
evidently from a source asking for non-hybrids,
evidently from "people whose cryptographic expertise I cannot doubt";
if that source isn't NSA, who is it?</p>
<p>(Side note: If you think the word "pure" in "pure ML-KEM" sounds good,
remember that replacing CECPQ2's ECC+SIKE with "pure SIKE" would have been a disaster.)</p>
<p>In June 2025,
NSA's Mike Jenkins
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/spasm/xUKIoHQwm1BjNZWS2x3xb-BhsLI/">posted</a>
the following:
"As the CNSA 2.0 profiles should make clear, we are looking for products that support /standalone/ ML-DSA-87 and /standalone/ ML-KEM-1024. If there is one vendor
that produces one product that complies, then that is the product that goes on the compliance list and is approved for use. Our interactions with vendors suggests
that this won't be a problem in most cases."
Evidently there are many companies happy to jump when NSA says jump.</p>
<p><strong><a name="dogfood">Pretending to eat your own dog food.</a></strong>
For software engineers,
"dogfooding"
(a term
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120406142929/http://www.arnnet.com.au/article/317315/vmworld_2009_virtualization_controversy_eating_your_own_dog_food/?fp=39&amp;fpid=25874&amp;rid=1">perhaps</a>
coined by Paul Maritz in the 1980s)
refers to making regular use of the software that you're writing.
This builds your confidence that the software works,
and helps iron out problems.</p>
<p>But there's also a marketing version of the same concept,
where you publicly <em>say</em> that you're using your own software
as a way to build <em>other people's</em> confidence in the software.
As in other types of marketing,
what you're saying doesn't have to be true.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, NSA
<a href="https://archive.org/details/cold_war_iii-nsa/cold_war_iii-ISCAP/page/n239/mode/2up">weakened</a>
the Data Encryption Standard to just 56 bits.
In public,
NSA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220805195031/https://cryptome.org/nsa-inman-1979.pdf">claimed</a>
that it hadn't tampered with the standard,
and that the
"implausibility of public allegations is further demonstrated by the fact that
NSA has endorsed the use of DES for the encryption of national security-related information,
including selected classified information".</p>
<p>This is powerful marketing.
Many people hearing this last quote will think
"Oh, okay, NSA is using DES, so DES is strong".
Koblitz and Menezes
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151122060827/https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1018.pdf">claimed</a>
that it's "far-fetched"
that NSA would have intentionally selected something weak
"for U.S. government usage (for both unclassified and classified communications [41])".
Many people today will think
"Oh, okay, NSA is buying single encryption, so double encryption is unimportant".</p>
<p>But DES <a href="https://ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/27.pdf">wasn't</a> strong.
NSA had engineered DES to be
<a href="https://archive.org/details/cold_war_iii-nsa/cold_war_iii-ISCAP/page/n239/mode/2up">"weak enough"</a>
for NSA to break.
NSA wanted DES to
<a href="https://archive.org/details/cold_war_iii-nsa/cold_war_iii-ISCAP/page/n239/mode/2up">"drive out competitors"</a>,
to "reduce the field that NSA had to be concerned about".</p>
<p>It's perfectly plausible that NSA was using DES,
but surely NSA was then using DES multiple times (Triple-DES or beyond),
which makes it much harder to break
(as long as you <a href="https://sweet32.info/">switch keys frequently</a>).
Obviously NSA wouldn't have said "use multiple layers" publicly:
NSA wanted to fool people into thinking that DES was secure.</p>
<p>Today we have better ciphers than DES.
However, for data that it cares about,
NSA still uses two independent encryption layers
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220524232250/https://www.nsa.gov/Portals/75/documents/resources/everyone/csfc/threat-prevention.pdf">"to mitigate the ability of an adversary to exploit a single cryptographic implementation"</a>.
Gee, maybe multiple encryption is important after all!</p>
<p>Try to put yourself in
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20250930-stealth.html">the mindset of NSA as an attacker</a>.
You have a
<a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2014/04/09/20130905-guard-sigint_enabling.pdf">massive budget</a>
to "covertly influence and/or overtly leverage" systems
to "make the systems in question exploitable";
"to the consumer and other adversaries, however, the systems' security remains intact".
One of your action items is to "influence policies, standards and specification
for commercial public key technologies".
Another is to "shape the worldwide commercial cryptography marketplace
to make it more tractable to advanced cryptanalytic capabilities being developed by NSA/CSS".</p>
<p>You spend this money pursuing many different attack paths,
taking whatever surveillance wins you can get.
It's not that <em>everybody</em> was using Dual EC,
for example,
but you managed to manipulate <em>some</em> people into using it,
and for you that's a win.</p>
<p>Weakening ECC+PQ to just PQ,
normalizing the practice of driving without seatbelts,
is another win for you as the attacker.
It's adding further vulnerabilities to the cryptographic ecosystem.
The point is that,
beyond SIKE and <a href="https://cr.yp.to/papers.html#qrcsp">many other</a> publicly broken cryptosystems,
there will be some further cases where
your "advanced cryptanalytic capabilities" break the PQ part
while the "consumer and other adversaries" think the PQ part is secure.</p>
<p>What do you do with your control over the U.S. military budget?
That's another opportunity to "shape the worldwide commercial cryptography marketplace".
You can tell people that you won't authorize purchasing double encryption.
You can even follow through on having the military publicly purchase single encryption.
Meanwhile you quietly spend a negligible amount of money on an independent encryption layer
to protect the data that you care about,
so you're actually using double encryption.</p>
<p><strong><a name="callgood">Adoption of double encryption in TLS.</a></strong>
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7221">"Adoption"</a>
in IETF is a preliminary step before standardization:
when a WG is
"ready to develop a particular document, the most common mechanism is
for it to 'adopt' an existing document as a starting point".</p>
<p>In March 2025,
after the close of a two-week "WG adoption call",
the TLS WG chairs declared
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250419105450/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/iGLZeIYzsIZPYO1ezA2Eulv5x98/">"consensus to adopt"</a>
the "Post-quantum hybrid ECDHE-MLKEM Key Agreement for TLSv1.3" draft.</p>
<p>There were no objections to the declaration of consensus on adopting this draft.
I had pointed out that the patents on Kyber/ML-KEM create two issues related to
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250405080704/https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8179/">IETF's patent policy</a>,
but I said that the first issue can be fixed after adoption (before standardization),
and I now think that this is also true for the second issue.
The risks from patents are orthogonal to the risks from non-hybrids,
and I won't say more about patents in this blog post.</p>
<p><strong><a name="options">Why worry about a weaker standard if there's a stronger standard?</a></strong>
At this point you might be wondering:
if people are driving with seatbelts and this is on its way to being standardized,
what's the problem with <em>also</em> having a driving-without-seatbelts standard
for reckless fools who want to use that?</p>
<p>Think about Dual EC.
Dual EC wasn't the only randomness-generation standard.
But companies paid for FIPS certification of at least
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130224022123/http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/drbg/drbgval.html">62 different implementations</a>
of Dual EC.
NSA
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-security-rsa-idUSBRE9BJ1C220131220">bribed</a>
the RSA company to change its popular cryptographic library
to use Dual EC by default.</p>
<p>These companies saw that Dual EC was a standard from a reputable standards organization
(in fact, from three such organizations, namely ANSI, ISO, and NIST).
Even for companies realizing that Dual EC was a controversial standard pushed by NSA,
how many companies would risk losing money by refusing to implement Dual EC?
It's <em>easy</em> for purchasing managers to use standards to set purchasing requirements.</p>
<p>What's particularly pernicious about a driving-without-seatbelts standard
is that a purchasing manager who looks at it has an incentive to pick it
instead of the driving-with-seatbelts standard.
Wow, I can save $50 for every seatbelt that I skip!
Wow, I can save <a href="https://cr.yp.to/papers.html#pppqefs">50 picodollars</a> for every ECC operation that I skip!
The purchasing manager doesn't care whether this cost reduction matters in context:
every penny saved sounds good, right?
The purchasing manager also doesn't realize the standard is <em>dangerous</em>:
on the contrary, why would it be a standard if it were unsafe?</p>
<p>Soon we're faced with widespread non-usage of seatbelts.
And then, years too late,
we realize that, oops, something people used and thought was secure actually wasn't,
just as in the case of SIKE.</p>
<p><strong><a name="callbad">Adoption of single encryption in TLS.</a></strong>
On 1 April 2025—unfortunately not as a joke—the TLS WG chairs
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/PpVAwrBTuRb5pR6D0C1ipdQuvYc/">issued</a>
a two-week "WG adoption call for the ML-KEM Post-Quantum Key Agreement for TLS 1.3 I-D",
the non-hybrid draft mentioned above.</p>
<p>Here are some quotes (some from me, some from other people)
illustrating objections raised on the TLS mailing list during the call period:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The draft creates security risks</strong>.
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/2Dfu4x678DEKCzF-fkdvJHJkS-8/">Sample quote</a>:
  "SIKE was applied to large volumes of user data as part of the CECPQ2
  experiment in 2019. SIKE was publicly broken in 2022.
  [paragraph break]
  The <em>only</em> reason that this didn't immediately give away the user data
  to attackers is that CECPQ2 was ECC+SIKE, rather than just SIKE.
  [paragraph break]
  Should we keep rolling out post-quantum cryptosystems to <em>try</em> to stop
  future quantum attacks? Yes, of course. But, just in case this goes
  horribly wrong <em>again</em>, let's make sure to keep ECC in place. Any draft
  violating this should be rejected as a security risk not just by WGs but
  also by the ISE."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The draft violates BCP 188.</strong>

  "To the extent that this is an allusion to
  NSA purchasing, it violates BCP 188 ('IETF Will Work to Mitigate
  Pervasive Monitoring')."</p>

  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/xJqwB30b5wf3GVlAiIP3O4tuBIE/">Sample quote</a>:
  "the draft's regression from ECC+PQ to just PQ
  is certainly a technology issue; and this is fatal, as a contravention
  of the 'improve security' goal in the WG charter".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>There are no principles supporting the adoption decision.</strong>
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/toxVUv_d1pdDspbfo8OxcJeC_QU/">Sample quote</a>:
  "I don't see what criteria we might use in adopting this that
  wouldn't leave the WG open to accusations of favouritism if
  we don't adopt other pure PQ national standards that will
  certainly arise".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The draft's motivation section is circular.</strong>
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/YNSu6ZO5e0JMJ1cRlnxh6oIjyZg/">Sample quote</a>:
  there is
  "a preliminary step that
  has been skipped here, namely identifying why the proposal is claimed to
  be adding something important. The draft's motivation sentence consists
  of rearranging buzzwords without answering the question:
  'Having a fully post-quantum (not hybrid) key agreement option for TLS
  1.3 is necessary for migrating beyond hybrids and for users that need
  to be fully post-quantum.'&nbsp;"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The draft increases software complexity.</strong>

  "The main stated benefit of using a standalone ML-KEM is complexity
  reduction, but with the current progress in the deployment of the ML-KEM +
  ECC hybrid method, a standalone ML-KEM method actually increases overall
  complexity in software stacks."
  (This was responding to a claim during the adoption-call period
  that the draft provided a "compute / dependency base that is minimalist".)</p>

</ul>
<p>This is just a high-level survey of the objections.
These quotes aren't intended to convey the full text of objections.
They also aren't intended to convey the number of people objecting;
I'll get back to that below.</p>
<p><strong><a name="standards">Standardization procedures.</a></strong>
How does a standards-development organization handle objections?
The law on this topic in the United States has been settled for decades.</p>
<p>The starting point is that
agreements in restraint of interstate commerce are
<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2024-title15/html/USCODE-2024-title15-chap1-sec1.htm">illegal</a>.
Courts interpret this to cover various types of agreements
that are illegal <em>per se</em>,
such as price fixing and group boycotts,
along with further agreements that unreasonably interfere with competition.</p>
<p>Here's an
<a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/456/556/">example</a>
from the 1980s.
Agents of a company that was leading its market, McDonnell and Miller,
took control of a subcommittee of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers,
a standards-development organization.
They generated a letter, under ASME's apparent authority,
declaring that a new competitor's product wasn't compliant.
They distributed that letter to buyers, of course damaging the new competitor's business.</p>
<p>The competitor, HydroLevel, sued the conspirators—including ASME,
which didn't even <em>know</em> the abuse was happening.
HydroLevel won. ASME was ultimately forced to pay millions of dollars.
The Supreme Court didn't mince words in describing the anti-competitive
power of standards-development organizations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ASME wields great power in the Nation's economy. Its codes and
standards influence the policies of numerous States and cities, and,
as has been said about "so-called voluntary standards" generally,
its interpretations of its guidelines "may result in economic
prosperity or economic failure, for a number of businesses of all
sizes throughout the country," as well as entire segments of an
industry. ... ASME can be said to be "in reality, an
extragovernmental agency which prescribes rules for the regulation
and restraint of interstate commerce." ... When it cloaks its
subcommittee officials with the authority of its reputation, ASME
permits those agents to affect the destinies of businesses, and thus
gives them the power to frustrate competition in the marketplace.</p>
<p>... Many of ASME's officials are associated with members of the
industries regulated by ASME's codes. Although undoubtedly most
serve ASME without concern for the interests of their corporate
employers, some may well view their positions with ASME, at least in
part, as an opportunity to benefit their employers. When the great
influence of ASME's reputation is placed at their disposal, the less
altruistic of ASME's agents have an opportunity to harm their
employers' competitors through manipulation of ASME's codes.</p>
<p>... Only ASME can take systematic steps to make improper conduct on
the part of all its agents unlikely, and the possibility of civil
liability will inevitably be a powerful incentive for ASME to take
those steps. Thus, a rule that imposes liability on the
standard-setting organization -- which is best situated to prevent
antitrust violations through the abuse of its reputation -- is most
faithful to the congressional intent that the private right of
action deter antitrust violations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another
<a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/486/492/">Supreme Court case</a>
rejected an argument of
antitrust immunity for another standards-development organization.
The organization made various decisions by majority vote,
and had allowed
steel manufacturers to pack a standards-development group,
filling the group with pro-steel agents to take over a vote.
The Supreme Court
again recognized the importance of procedural safeguards preventing abuse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The antitrust validity of these efforts is not established, without
more, by petitioner's literal compliance with the rules of the
Association, for the hope of procompetitive benefits depends upon
the existence of safeguards sufficient to prevent the
standard-setting process from being biased by members with economic
interests in restraining competition. An association cannot validate
the anticompetitive activities of its members simply by adopting
rules that fail to provide such safeguards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Supreme Court declined at that point to draw a dividing line saying
which safeguards were required.
In 2004, Congress passed a
<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2024-title15/html/USCODE-2024-title15-chap69-sec4302.htm">law</a>
pinning this down:
the new law said that "standards development activity" by a "standards development organization"
isn't illegal <em>per se</em>,
and gave
<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2024-title15/html/USCODE-2024-title15-chap69-sec4301.htm">definitions</a>
of the quoted phrases.</p>
<p>In particular, a "standards development organization" is required by law to
"incorporate the attributes of openness, balance of interests, due process, an appeals process, and consensus in a manner consistent
with the Office of Management and Budget Circular Number A-119, as revised February 10, 1998".</p>
<p>That
<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-1998-02-19/html/98-4177.htm">OMB rule</a>,
in turn,
defines "consensus" as follows:
"general
agreement, but not necessarily unanimity, and includes a process for
attempting to resolve objections by interested parties, as long as all
comments have been fairly considered, each objector is advised of the
disposition of his or her objection(s) and the reasons why, and the
consensus body members are given an opportunity to change their votes
after reviewing the comments".</p>
<p>The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice
inserted itself into a private court case in
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250207015058/https://www.justice.gov/atr/case-document/file/1178246/dl">2019</a>
to say that "the United States has a significant
interest in the correct interpretation of the exemption from <em>per se</em>
treatment for standards development organizations engaging in standard setting activities".</p>
<p>Deputy Assistant Attorney General Alexander Okuliar in the same division
presented a longer statement to ANSI in
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250617062615/https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/speech/file/1281926/dl">2020</a>
regarding antitrust and standards.
The statement mentioned ANSI's compliance with the same requirements and said
"From an antitrust perspective, these requirements are central".</p>
<p>Here's a random
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250915073928/https://www.electropedia.org/iev/iev.nsf/2907043f18b6c837c1256f2b00710424/0b9474d4e73bb310c12585fa0058b1ce/$FILE/C00067%20evaluation%20observations-final.pdf">example</a>
of what an objection-response document looks like in ISO, IEC, etc.
Not the best user interface, but it gets the job done.</p>
<p><strong><a name="agreement">There was not general agreement to adopt the non-hybrid draft.</a></strong>
Now that we have the concept of consensus in mind,
let's go back to what happened in the IETF TLS WG
regarding the non-hybrid draft.</p>
<p>During the adoption-call period,
there were statements from 20 people unequivocally supporting adoption:
David Adrian from Google,
Joseph Birr-Pixton,
Uri Blumenthal from Department of Defense subsidiary Lincoln Labs,
"Flo D" from GCHQ,
Quynh Dang from NIST,
Viktor Dukhovni,
Scott Fluhrer from Cisco,
Rebecca Guthrie from NSA,
Russ Housley,
Alicja Kario from IBM subsidiary Red Hat,
Kris Kwiatkowski,
Andrei Popov from Microsoft,
Tirumal Reddy from Cisco,
Yaroslav Rosomakho,
Jan Schaumann,
Sophie Schmieg from Google,
Martin Thomson from Mozilla,
Filippo Valsorda formerly from Google,
Loganaden Velvindron,
and
Thom Wiggers.</p>
<p>There were also statements from 2 people <em>conditionally</em> supporting adoption:
John Mattsson from Ericsson
("I support adoption as long as reuse of ephemeral keys is normatively forbidden, i.e.  MUST NOT reuse")
and
Yaakov Stein
("I support adoption of pure PQC KEMs drafts with Intended status: Informational
(meaning that the IETF is not recommending using)").</p>
<p>However, there were statements from 7 people unequivocally opposing adoption:
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/YyemGJF-4-hRVwOcJ47Rw4Nu8Js/">Thomas Bellebaum</a>
  ("I agree with Stephen on this one and would not support adoption of non-hybrids"),
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/uOmcMEqlyekrvcOgdsf7GtIlf3w/">Andrey Jivsov</a>
  ("I am opposed to the adoption of ML-KEM at this time"),
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/toxVUv_d1pdDspbfo8OxcJeC_QU/">Stephen Farrell</a>
  ("I'm opposed to adoption, at this time"),
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/0f6XBGPElMLNoiS1Eh3u7EhzoGc/">Rich Salz</a>
  ("I was all set to say that I am in favor of adoption, but Stephen's post
  changed my mind. [paragraph break] The conservative and safe thing is to stick to hybrids and that is what the IETF should do for now"),
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/uhWI53zIjWJT5ZiS_UthyBe2k9Y/">Rob Sayre</a>
  ("I oppose adoption"),
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/EzKcwjagajQqcRpH4TDTn70W9hc/">Sun Shuzhou</a>
  ("I'm opposed to adoption"),
and me.</p>
<p>Even assuming that the 2 statements of conditional support are treated as positive votes,
the overall situation here, 22 positive votes and 7 negative votes,
does not qualify as general agreement.
"General"
<a href="https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/general">means</a>
"shared by or affecting most people, or most of the people in a group";
"most"
<a href="https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/most">means</a>
"nearly all of the people or things in a group, or nearly all of something";
the phrase "general agreement" means that nearly everyone agrees.
Merely having three quarters agree is not good enough.</p>
<p>What happens if a standards-development organization issues a rule
declaring that "general agreement" exists
even when a quarter of the votes are in opposition?
I haven't found any court cases on point,
but I would expect courts to reject this
as being inconsistent with the plain meaning of "general agreement".</p>
<p>Anyway, IETF hasn't attempted to issue such a rule.
On the contrary, IETF
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250603130154/https://www.ietf.org/about/introduction/">claims</a>
that WG decisions are <em>not</em> taken by voting:
"Decisions within WGs, as with the broader IETF, are taken by 'rough consensus' and not by voting."
This begs the question of what IETF thinks "rough consensus" means.
Letting chairs make arbitrary decisions is a violation of due process.</p>
<p>More to the point, IETF can't override the definition of "consensus" in the law.
That definition requires general agreement.
Adoption of this draft was controversial, and didn't reach general agreement.</p>
<p><strong><a name="resolution">Objections were not handled properly.</a></strong>
Within the statements in favor of adoption,
most of the statements were very short:
e.g., just the words "I support adoption" with no further comments.</p>
<p>Some statements in favor of adoption did say more,
such as stating circular arguments for the draft
(e.g.: "as time progresses, non-hybrid key exchanges will
become more and more commonplace, so why not have it already defined?"),
or expressing concerns about key reuse
(e.g.: "I also share John's concerns about key reuse,
but would prefer to litigate that in the working group, rather than during adoption"),
without responding to the content of the objections.</p>
<p>There was a response to one word in the lack-of-principles objection.
(The response was as follows:
"The NIST competition was international, and Kyber was developed by an
international team. I struggle to understand how adopting this document
would somehow be 'favoritism'.")
A brief note by one supporter tangentially related to one objection
falls far short of fair consideration of each objection by the group as a whole.</p>
<p>I tried to engage that supporter in discussion.
I started by quoting the following earlier statement in the commentator's message:
"I find it to be cognitive dissonance to simultaneously argue that the
quantum threat requires immediate work, and yet we are also somehow
uncertain of if the algorithms are totally broken. Both cannot be true
at the same time."
I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/2Dfu4x678DEKCzF-fkdvJHJkS-8/">responded</a>
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rolling out PQ is trying to reduce the damage from an attacker having a
quantum computer within the security lifetime of the user data. Doing
that as ECC+PQ instead of just PQ is trying to reduce the damage in case
the PQ part is broken. These actions are compatible, so how exactly do
you believe they're contradictory?</p>
<p>Here's an analogous example of basic risk mitigation: there's endless
work that goes into having planes not crash, not hit turbulence, etc.,
but we still ask airplane passengers to keep their seatbelts on whenever
they're in their seats.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was still no reply to this
by the time the adoption call closed two weeks later.</p>
<p>The broader pattern was that
objectors were engaging in discussion while supporters were not.
The majority process wasn't "attempting to resolve each objection";
it was simply collecting positive votes,
trying to <em>override</em> objections from the minority
without even <em>answering</em> those objections,
let alone trying to <em>resolve</em> them.</p>
<p>That's in an organization saying that decisions aren't taken by voting.
The same organization also
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250528213926/https://www.ietf.org/blog/ietf-llc-statement-competition-law-issues/">says</a>,
as part of explaining why it's supposedly complying with antitrust law:
"IETF activities are conducted with extreme transparency, in public forums. Decision-making requires achieving broad consensus via these public processes."</p>
<p>When there's an objection,
the legal concept of consensus
requires not just fairly considering the objection,
and not just attempting to resolve the objection,
but—if resolution fails—having the group agree on
the contents of a <em>response</em> to the objection.
That's an official statement of <em>why</em> the objection was overridden.
It's something that can be appealed if it's wrong.
Consider, for example,
ISO's
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250626064256/https://www.iso.org/sites/directives/current/consolidated/index.html#a_2_5_3">simple rule</a>
saying "Committees are required to respond to all comments received".
In IETF, there weren't even <em>informal</em> responses to the objections listed above,
let alone official responses.</p>
<p><strong><a name="chairs">The chairs declared consensus anyway.</a></strong>
Shortly before the end of the specified adoption-call period,
the chairs
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/_AWy51BSgX1ipv0hfnAzLrDrTYI/">declared</a>
"consensus to adopt this draft as a working group item".
There were some notes on followup procedures,
but there was no explanation of the rationale for this claim of consensus.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250424144801/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/iCPW1FHzdwoYuUztIVfZvDtJYII/">challenged</a>
the claim of consensus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Um, what? There were several people (including me) raising objections on
list to basic flaws in this draft, such as (1) the failure to provide an
ECC backup to limit the damage from further security problems in the PQ
layer, (2) the failure to provide an engineering justification for this
option, and (3) the lack of any principles that would justify saying no
to options selected by other governments if this option is allowed.</p>
<p>Your message doesn't explain how you came to the conclusion that there's
consensus. Surely you aren't relying on some tally of positive votes to
ram this document through while ignoring objections; voting isn't how
IETF is supposed to work. So how <em>did</em> you come to this conclusion?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few days later,
the chairs
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250522155251/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/k7_PEqKZulXMtm-D_9pEvfqcxAU/">responded</a>
that they had declared consensus
"because there is clearly sufficient interest to work on this draft".</p>
<p>I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250513013809/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/501mDxIkopb4xubDc8YQYyiZQDU/">said</a>
that this was ambiguous (sufficient for what?);
said that in any case this criterion was improper since it "would allow a draft to be adopted
over amply justified objections of almost all WG participants,
simply because the chairs and a few participants say they have enough interest in working on the draft";
and asked for an explicit statement
of whether this was the complete explanation
of why the chairs had declared consensus.</p>
<p>The chairs
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250617140508/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/25uD_umU7uOL9LQ1sirFxyA9xmA/">responded</a>
that "sufficient" means "that there were enough people willing to review the draft".
They added that "WGs groups have adopted drafts with much less support than this one received."
Gee, that's confidence-inspiring.</p>
<p>Meanwhile
an IETF "security area director"
had jumped into the discussion,
in particular
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250517194102/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/RK1HQB7Y-WFBxQaAveeT7pHZbbc/">writing</a>
"There is clearly consensus
based on the 67 responses to the adoption call. ...
The vast majority was in favour of adoption ...
There were a few dissenting opinions".</p>
<p>Remember that the actual tallies were 20 supporters, 2 conditional supporters, and 7 opponents,
even if some people (for example, me) had sent multiple messages.
Nobody had posted the actual tallies at this point:
there was just this "security area director" claiming that the "vast majority" of the "67 responses" were in favor
while there were only "a few dissenting opinions".
Also remember that this is an organization that claims
that it doesn't make decisions by voting.</p>
<p>The "security area director"
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250517194102/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/RK1HQB7Y-WFBxQaAveeT7pHZbbc/">continued</a>
that "you cherry-picking when to call
consensus evaluation 'voting' depending on whether misnaming this
is in your advantage ... is dishonestly manipulative";
that I was violating the "code of conduct";
and that if I did not "voluntarily stop this kind of behaviour"
there would be "measures under the terms of RFC3934 which is part of BCP25".</p>
<p>In a
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250513185456/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/nqouPVfPtU7hm-RF0lSDHCfze54/">followup message</a>,
the "security area director" wrote
"you calling into question this consensus
call of the WG chair is abusive and follows a repetitive pattern.
Nevertheless, for now this is your right ...
you are attempting to bait the chairs to
say they took inventory of the public emails ...
there comes a point where you will be prevented from further playing these games".</p>
<p>Wait a minute: "<em>for now</em> this is your right" (emphasis added)
and "you will be prevented from further playing these games"?
Sounds ominous.
What did the "security area director" mean by this?
No more objections in IETF?
No more appeals?
NSA's minions can just ram their non-consensual drafts through IETF
without opponents even being allowed to <em>speak up</em>?</p>
<p>Actually, yes, there's a stealth activity going on right now
that will have this effect unless enough people take action by Tuesday the 7th.
I hope to have another blog post up in a day or two saying what's going on here.</p>
<p>Anyway,
I've filed a formal
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20250812-non-hybrid.pdf">complaint</a>
regarding the claim of consensus to adopt.
So far the complaint hasn't been handled properly,
but hope springs eternal.
I don't have an answer yet to the subtitle question of this blog post.</p><hr><span size="1"><b>Version:</b>

<p>What’s the catch? Seems to good to be true? Well, this thing sits between your devices and the wall. So you need to neatly run extension cables from every room in the house to the “sun box”, and then run one cable from the box to the panels, and another to the wall (optional, just so it can fall back to pulling power from the wall). Photos of this are coming soon.</p>

<p>Will it ever push power back into the wall? Nope! It’ll only ever draw from the wall in the event that both the sun is down and the battery is dead (so your fridge won’t go off overnight for example).</p>

<p>Is this legal? Yes, see above. No difference to plugging your fridge into your wall, as far as the utility is concerned.</p>

The only change </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/02/uks-demands-apple-break-encryption-emergency-us-all"><span>since the last time</span></a><span> they demanded this is that the order is allegedly limited to only apply to British users. That doesn’t make it any better.</span></p>
<p><span>The demand uses a power called a “Technical Capability Notice” (TCN) in the U.K.’s Investigatory Powers Act. </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/02/investigatory-powers-bill-and-apple"><span>At the time of its signing</span></a><span> we noted this law would likely be used to demand Apple spy on its users. <br></span></p>
<p><span>After the U.K. government first issued the TCN in January, </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/02/cornered-uks-demand-encryption-backdoor-apple-turns-its-strongest-security-setting"><span>Apple was forced</span></a><span> to either create a backdoor or block its </span><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/how-encrypt-your-iphone"><span>Advanced Data Protection</span></a><span> feature—which turns on end-to-end encryption for iCloud—for all U.K. users. The company decided to remove the feature in the U.K. instead of creating the backdoor.</span></p>
<p><span>The initial order from January targeted the data of </span><i><span>all</span></i><span> Apple users. In August, the </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/us-spy-chief-gabbard-says-uk-agreed-drop-backdoor-mandate-apple-2025-08-19/"><span>US claimed the U.K. withdrew the demand</span></a><span>, but Apple did not re-enable Advanced Data Protection. The new order provides insight into why: the U.K. was just rewriting it to only apply to British users. <br></span></p>
<p><span>This is still an unsettling overreach that makes U.K. users less safe and less free. As we’ve said</span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/clipper-chips-birthday-looking-back-22-years-key-escrow-failures"> <span>time</span></a><span> and</span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/why-adding-client-side-scanning-breaks-end-end-encryption"> <span>time again</span></a><span>,</span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/10/salt-typhoon-hack-shows-theres-no-security-backdoor-thats-only-good-guys"> <span>any backdoor built for the government</span></a><span> puts everyone at greater risk of hacking, identity theft, and fraud. It sets a dangerous precedent to demand similar data from other companies, and provides a runway for other authoritarian governments to issue comparable orders. The news of continued server-side access to users' data comes just days after the UK government announced an </span><a href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/press-releases/id-cards-uk-risks-sleeping-walking-into-pre-crime-state/"><span>intrusive mandatory digital ID scheme</span></a><span>, framed as a measure against illegal migration.</span></p>
<p><span>A tribunal hearing was initially set to </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c740r0m4mzjo"><span>take place in January 2026</span></a><span>, though it’s currently unclear if that will proceed or if the new order changes the legal process. Apple must continue to refuse these types of backdoors. Breaking end-to-end encryption for one country breaks it for everyone. These repeated attempts to weaken encryption violates</span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/03/european-court-human-rights-confirms-undermining-encryption-violates-fundamental"> <span>fundamental human rights</span></a><span> and destroys our right to private spaces.</span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.perspectives.plus/p/microsoft-365-copilot-commercial-failure">https://www.perspectives.plus/p/microsoft-365-copilot-commercial-failure</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45476045">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content-blocks"><p><span>The numbers are in: </span><span><strong>no one is paying for Microsoft 365 Copilot</strong></span><span>.</span></p><p><span>No, not the official numbers designed by Microsoft to </span><span><a href="https://www.perspectives.plus/p/numbers-designed-to-please" target="_blank" rel="">support their narrative</a></span><span>. I’m talking about something that MS would prefer not to address as these numbers tell a whole different story. As a result, they are from a source that we cannot verify and therefore something that every reader needs to evaluate the trustworthiness of.</span></p><div translations="[object Object]" homepath="/" loginpath="/login" subscribepath="/subscribe"><p>❝</p><p><span><em>“A source that has seen materials related to sales has confirmed that, as of August 2025, Microsoft has around </em></span><span><em><strong>eight million active licensed users of Microsoft 365 Copilot</strong></em></span><span><em>, amounting to a 1.81% conversion rate across the 440 million Microsoft 365 subscribers.”</em></span></p></div><p><span>I know, Ed Zitron is hardly a neutral observer of the tech industry. He is doing something that almost no one else out there bothers to do, though. Which is checking whether the numbers released by tech vendors (especially OpenAI) make any sense. This is the foundation upon which his case against the financial validity of GenAI is built on, and being a regular reader of his premium newsletter issues, I find it fairly convincing.</span></p><p><span>So, when someone on the inside wants to find a channel to bring out the inconvenient truth about AI adoption, Ed is where they would likely reach out to. These numbers that have been disclosed about Microsoft’s commercial success (failure) of selling Copilot licenses are in line with those reported about the adoption rate of other paid AI plans from other vendors.</span></p><p><span>The story can be summarized as follows:</span></p><p><span>M365 Copilot became available for enterprise customers to purchase on November 1st, 2023. That was almost 2 years ago. Now, if we assume that the adoption rate is constant, the conversion rate mentioned by Ed could grow to around 2% by the time we reach November 2025.</span></p><p><span><strong>The 2% adoption rate in 2 years is diabolically bad.</strong></span><span> This is not just any lil’ Power Apps product that was promoted as a new tool for citizen developers to improve personal productivity. It has been the centerpiece of everything Microsoft has done and talked about for over 2 years now. I have never seen a bigger push for any MS product.</span></p><p><span>After all this — what do we even have here? 8 million active licensed users. For some tech products that might be a sizeable user base. But let’s be real here: Microsoft has at least 400,000 channel partners. If each partner org would have bought on average 20 seats of Microsoft 365 Copilot for their employees, that would already make up the 8M figure.</span></p><p><span>Indeed, most partners have to pay for the M365 Copilot seats. There are hardly any freebies available in the partner benefits packages. I pay €800 a year for MS licenses in </span><span><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/membership/partner-success-core-benefits" target="_blank" rel="">Partner Success Core</a></span><span> and that doesn’t give me a single M365 Copilot seat. I have to pay the full price of €337 per year to get a chance to use the premium Copilot experience in my tenant for my solopreneur </span><span><a href="https://niiranenadvisory.com/" target="_blank" rel="">Power Platform advisory business</a></span><span>.</span></p><div><p><a target="_blank" href="https://niiranenadvisory.com/"><img src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,quality=80,format=auto,onerror=redirect/uploads/asset/file/1048e07d-ae52-43b3-b9f0-f0a89a45f137/Need_more_than_Perspectives.png" alt=""></a></p></div><p><span>This, of course, makes it easier to evaluate whether I get value from the license or not. While I acknowledge that I’m not the typical user persona for M365 Copilot, it has given me just a fraction of the value that my ChatGPT Plus subscription does. At a lower price point. Since I don’t have to sell and promote this product to customers, like many MS partners do, I’m free to tell everyone about this experience. As I’ve done in this newsletter for the past year on many, many occasions.</span></p><p><span>It could have been just me who’s a cranky old CRM consultant shouting at the AI cloud. Well, based on these adoption numbers for Microsoft 365 Copilot, I’m not in the minority. </span><span><strong>The vast majority of people out there who use Microsoft cloud tools don’t see Copilot as giving them enough value to justify the $30 per month cost.</strong></span></p><p><span>Remember: even though these aren’t individual users buying things for themselves, we’re not talking about just another MS license. This is AI! It’s the thing that’s </span><span><em>“no longer optional”</em></span><span> at so many companies — thanks to all the AI CEOs forcing their employees to adopt it or else. We read about these initiatives from media of how business leaders want to transform their company via AI on a daily basis.</span></p><p><span>There must be loads of companies who have gone and ticked the AI box by choosing to purchase M365 Copilot licenses. And despite all this blind support from management, this is as far as Microsoft has gotten with the paid Copilot product sales.</span></p><p id="agents-arent-doing-any-better"><h2 translations="[object Object]" homepath="/" loginpath="/login" subscribepath="/subscribe"><span>Agents aren’t doing any better</span></h2></p><p><span>Another interesting figure from Ed’s newsletter was about SharePoint agents:</span></p><div translations="[object Object]" homepath="/" loginpath="/login" subscribepath="/subscribe"><p>❝</p><p><span><span><em>“I’m also hearing that less than SharePoint — another popular enterprise app from Microsoft with 250 million users — had less than 300,000 weekly active users of its AI copilot features in August.”</em></span></span></p></div><p><span>Hmm, let’s see now. What other numbers do we have of agents that we could compare this with? Oh, right! The 3 million agents in FY25 story. Let’s revisit a screenshot I shared in my </span><span><a href="https://www.perspectives.plus/p/numbers-designed-to-please" target="_blank" rel="">Numbers designed to please</a></span><span> article a couple of months ago:</span></p><div><p><img src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,quality=80,format=auto,onerror=redirect/uploads/asset/file/d3ff173e-686b-4c23-bd8b-d57c9561ef38/3_million_agents_Jeff_Teper.png" alt=""></p></div><p><span>My theory (as well as Suhail’s) was that most of the 3M agents would be in SharePoint, and they wouldn’t be in production use. Weekly usage could well be considered a threshold for an AI agent being in production, so that would give us 10% when comparing it to the 300k figure in Ed’s newsletter.</span></p><p><span>But that was about </span><span><strong>users</strong></span><span>. Unlike Copilot, which is supposed to be a personal AI assistant, agents are meant to be tools that many individuals tap into with their Copilot. Now, let’s ignore for a moment the crazy fact that you can’t use SharePoint agents in the Microsoft 365 Copilot UI. Out of the 300 million users of SharePoint Online (I don’t know why Ed said only 250M), 0.1% of them interacted with an agent during a week in August 2025. </span><span><strong>One user out of a thousand</strong></span><span>.</span></p><p><span>Can you feel the AI transformation already?</span></p><p id="where-does-microsoft-go-from-here"><h2 translations="[object Object]" homepath="/" loginpath="/login" subscribepath="/subscribe"><span>Where does Microsoft go from here?</span></h2></p><p><span>If this were a normal software product, the industry would have moved on already and invented something else to pitch to customers. In practice, it is anything but normal. GenAI is the only story left for Big Tech to tell when chasing for ever greater growth percentages. And yet the only thing growing are the capex investments.</span></p><p><span>Getting people to use AI services that they either want to (ChatGPT, all the AI coding assistants) or can’t avoid (Google search AI overviews, free Copilot features in MS products) is one thing. Making them voluntarily open their wallets and insert a credit card to purchase some of the AI magic dust is a whole different game. That’s the game where everyone has been losing so far, as no one besides NVidia or the IT consulting companies is making profits from GenAI at this point.</span></p><p><span>It’s not like all those GPUs could be left underutilized, though. The growth of especially the US economy relies on AI related activities. If they were to be removed, the </span><span><a href="https://www.perspectives.plus/p/what-bubble-oh-that-bubble" target="_blank" rel="">bubble would burst</a></span><span>. So, rolling back AI features is not an option, understandably. The only possibility is to reimagine the monetization model and hope that it works this time. And that’s exactly what Microsoft is actively pursuing.</span></p><p><span>First of all, the idea of bundling more of Copilot into the licenses customers already have is the obvious way to boost AI adoption. Which may not bring in any new money, yet will be a critical number for MS to show to investors. Who could soon begin questioning why the capex spend is necessary if the </span><span><a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-case-against-generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="">GPU utilization for Microsoft 365’s enterprise Copilot is barely scratching 60%</a></span><span>.</span></p><p><span>Enter Copilot Chat in </span><span><s>Office</s></span><span> Microsoft 365 apps. </span><span><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft365copilotblog/copilot-chat-comes-to-the-microsoft-365-apps/4453349" target="_blank" rel="">Announced on September 15</a></span><span>, </span><span><em>“Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat and agents are rolling out in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote for all users—creating a unified chat experience across the apps millions of people use every day at work.”</em></span><span> What was once the main demo scenario of why contextual AI inside the business productivity apps is crucial for worker productivity is now something all 440 million M365 users get for no extra cost.</span></p><div><p><a target="_blank" href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft365copilotblog/copilot-chat-comes-to-the-microsoft-365-apps/4453349"><img src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,quality=80,format=auto,onerror=redirect/uploads/asset/file/684046c9-fc2e-400f-8199-71f2bb2cc742/Copilot_Chat_in_Microsoft_365_apps.png" alt=""></a></p><p><small><p><span>Copilot Chat pane in Outlook, PowerPoint, Excel, Word.

I of course raised my concerns about the same useless AI assistants issue </span><span><a href="https://www.perspectives.plus/p/assistants-without-hands" target="_blank" rel="">a couple of months ago already</a></span><span>. I’m glad it’s not just me who is too dumb to get Copilot in Outlook to work with email and calendar.</span></p><p><span>Then, there’s the next push: </span><span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/09/29/vibe-working-introducing-agent-mode-and-office-agent-in-microsoft-365-copilot/" target="_blank" rel="">vibe working</a></span><span>. What has been disguised as a marketing campaign to ride on the popularity of the vibe coding concept is actually an indirect admittance of the fact that GPT based M365 Copilot has been a disappointment for everyone. That’s why Microsoft is now teaming up with OpenAI’s biggest competitor Anthropic and building its new Office Agent features on top of Claude:</span></p><div translations="[object Object]" homepath="/" loginpath="/login" subscribepath="/subscribe"><p>❝</p><p><span><em>“Today we’re introducing Office Agent, a multi-agent system that builds upon an open-source stack, </em></span><span><em><strong>Anthropic's Claude model</strong></em></span><span><em>, and a new taste-driven development (TDD) paradigm to deliver polished PowerPoint presentations, ready-to-use Word documents, and soon Excel spreadsheets.”</em></span></p></div><p><span>All of that is preview stuff, of course. When MS announced they were </span><span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/09/24/expanding-model-choice-in-microsoft-365-copilot/" target="_blank" rel="">expanding model choice in M365 Copilot and Copilot Studio</a></span><span>, all the Modern Work consultants on LinkedIn were quick to point out that enabling Claude breaks the MS trust barrier for customer data. Well, tech industry reporters have been talking about how Charles Lamanna &amp; crew are embracing Claude for a while now, so I see it as only a matter of time before models like the new </span><span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/copilot-studio/available-today-claude-sonnet-4-5-in-microsoft-copilot-studio/" target="_blank" rel="">Claude Sonnet 4.5</a></span><span> are running on Azure in addition to AWS. Because otherwise the Office Agent won’t be as good with spreadsheets and docs like competing products that tap into the best LLM for the job.</span></p><p><span>How good is Office Agent then? Well, I did a quick test drive of the </span><span><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/excelblog/building-agent-mode-in-excel/4457320" target="_blank" rel="">Agent Mode in Excel</a></span><span>. Meaning, I installed the </span><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/agent-mode-in-excel-frontier-a2fd6fe4-97ac-416b-b89a-22f4d1357c7a" target="_blank" rel="">Excel Labs add-in</a></span><span> that seems to </span><span><strong>not</strong></span><span> require any Frontier program sign-up, contrary to what MS documentation says (that Copilot Frontier switch was erroring out in M365 Admin center for me, so I said </span><span><em>“f*** this”</em></span><span> and tried the tools without it). Then, I gave it a task: </span><span><em>“build me a 5-year investor-ready financial model for a SaaS startup.”</em></span><span> Like a user of our </span><span><a href="https://www.finmodeler.com/" target="_blank" rel="">FinModeler SaaS app</a></span><span> might do.</span></p><p><span>What was the result? 12 minutes of work, timing out after endless verifications and “finalizing” steps. Some numbers and formulas were added to the Excel workbook, sure. Would I trust this to be the type of financial model that I’d use in finding investors for my business? Hell no. So, it’s definitely a “vibes” kind of an LLM output that looks neat but you can’t build on top of.</span></p><div><p><iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://youtube.com/embed/Bv1vOx1wCMw" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" title="Youtube embed"></iframe></p></div><p><span>The introduction of all these agents that are not yet part of the official M365 Copilot product yet gives an indication of the direction where Microsoft is taking their AI narrative. After </span><span><a href="https://www.perspectives.plus/p/use-the-forced-copilot" target="_blank" rel="">forcing consumers to pay for Copilot</a></span><span>, redirecting the </span><span><a href="https://www.perspectives.plus/p/i-created-a-better-office-com" target="_blank" rel="">Office home page</a></span><span> to AI chat instead, and making Copilot a toxic brand along the way, now’s the time to double down on agents. </span><span><em>“Oh, Copilot, yeah that’s just the UI for AI, but to do anything useful with it you’ll need the latest agents.”</em></span></p><p><span>That would be perfectly in line with the upcoming </span><span><a href="https://www.perspectives.plus/p/who-is-microsoft-agent-365" target="_blank" rel="">Microsoft 365 Agent product announcement</a></span><span> that’s supposed to take place at Ignite 2025. Given how quickly things change in the MS AI roulette table, it might of course not arrive in the format that Charles Lamanna was telling in the internal memo in August. But one thing that I’m increasingly confident of is that </span><span><strong>we will see a per-agent monetization model emerge</strong></span><span>. Simply because the per user M365 Copilot commercial model has failed so dramatically.</span></p><p><span>The latest announcement of </span><span><strong><em>“Bring Your Own Copilot”</em></strong></span><span> model with the new personal and family </span><span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/10/01/meet-microsoft-365-premium-your-ai-and-productivity-powerhouse/" target="_blank" rel="">Microsoft 365 Premium SKU</a></span><span> is </span><span><u><strong>not</strong></u></span><span> a sign of the premium value of Copilot. On the contrary, the basic AI features in Office apps are now such a commodity that MS is simply creating a new model to allow individual employees to sneak in a paid Copilot license via their personal MS account into work context inside M365 tenants. Since only 2% of the workers had premium Copilot licenses anyway, getting a bigger audience opening the AI tools through any means necessary is now on the table.</span></p><p><span>And so we get the “BYOAI” model, something that will irritate every single enterprise IT admin, of course. But the thing is: a personal M365 Premium won’t unlock any of the premium features like MS Graph grounding for Copilot. Which should lead everyone to asking: “what exactly is premium anymore”? The answers from </span><span><a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft365copilotblog/employees-can-bring-copilot-from-their-personal-microsoft-365-plans-to-work---wh/4458212" target="_blank" rel="">this blog post</a></span><span> aren’t very detailed nor convincing:</span></p><div translations="[object Object]" homepath="/" loginpath="/login" subscribepath="/subscribe"><p>❝</p><p><span><strong><em>Q: What features are available with personal Copilot subscriptions?</em></strong></span><br><span><em>A: Features like Researcher, Analyst, Photos Agent, and Actions may be available depending on the subscription tier.

Another way to create automations in M365! And now in a secret Power Platform environment you can't see in Maker portals!"</span></p></small></p></div><p><span>At this point, no one at Microsoft knows what their plan is — because they don’t have one. The masterplan of transforming becoming The Copilot Company, announced at Ignite 2023, has backfired commercially. Satya’s big bet is not working and now he is inviting </span><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789558/microsoft-ceo-commercial-judson-althoff-internal-memo" target="_blank" rel="">Judson Althoff to be the CEO of all things commercial at MS</a></span><span> while he focuses on the technical challenges of AI:</span></p><p><span>The announcement is framed as a “tectonic AI platform shift”. There isn’t any concrete context given on what specifically is not working in the current mode of operation at Microsoft, just the general notion that everyone at the company needs to do better in these unprecedented times. Aside from the key thing about Nadella making way to Althoff, it’s pretty shallow. Here’s how the internal memo ends:</span></p><div translations="[object Object]" homepath="/" loginpath="/login" subscribepath="/subscribe"><p>❝</p><p><span><em>This will also allow our engineering leaders and me to be laser focused on our highest ambition technical work—across our datacenter buildout, systems architecture, AI science, and product innovation—to lead with intensity and pace in this generational platform shift.

Yup, that’s classic GPT writing. In practice, Satya Nadella isn’t even writing these announcements that are sent to all MS employees anymore. It’s all just AI talk. If would be much more honest if the memo would have been signed by Copilot instead.</span></p><p><span>While we wait for it to be reimagined as the CEO Agent, with Copilot as the UI for it, of course.</span></p><p id="this-is-not-a-failure"><h2 translations="[object Object]" homepath="/" loginpath="/login" subscribepath="/subscribe"><span>“This is not a failure!”</span></h2></p><p><span>After posting this newsletter issue </span><span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7379462621902757889/" target="_blank" rel="">on LinkedIn</a></span><span>, I got a lot of comments from Microsoft partners who disagreed with my interpretation of what the 8 million figure means. Hardly a surprise, given how much the business success of people selling and consulting M365 Copilot depends on the product being seen as something desirable.</span></p><p><span>I’m not saying all is lost for MS. My main point is that whatever they tried to pull off with the $30pupm M365 Copilot license backfired dramatically. Redmond will eventually “reimagine” things in a way that will let them put this failure behind them without ever actually addressing it. But we, the people working with Microsoft tech every day, deserve to know what happened and remember it the next time a similar stunt is played.</span></p><p><span>To illustrate my point, and give it a perspective that’s not just “my opinion with no facts whatsoever” (as some people on the professional network said), I asked Claude Sonnet 4.5 to crunch the same numbers.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/10/privacy-harm-harm">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/10/privacy-harm-harm</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45474441">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <article role="article">
  
  
  <div><p>Every day, corporations track our movements through license plate scanners, building detailed profiles of where we go, when we go there, and who we visit. When they do this to us in violation of data privacy laws, we’ve suffered a real harm—period. We shouldn’t need to prove we’ve suffered additional damage, such as physical injury or monetary loss, to have our day in court.</p>
<p>That's why EFF is proud to join an <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/2025-09-25-mata-v-dnr-amicus-br-aclu-eff-etc">amicus brief</a> in <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/102042-texas-company-violated-privacy-millions-california-drivers-claims.html"><em>Mata v. Digital Recognition Network</em></a>, a lawsuit by drivers against a corporation that allegedly violated a California <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&amp;division=3.&amp;title=1.81.23.&amp;part=4.&amp;chapter=&amp;article=">statute</a> that regulates Automatic License Plate Readers (<a href="https://sls.eff.org/technologies/automated-license-plate-readers-alprs">ALPRs</a>). The state trial court erroneously dismissed the case, by misinterpreting this data privacy law to require proof of extra harm beyond privacy harm. The brief was written by the <a href="https://www.aclunc.org/home">ACLU of Northern California</a>, Stanford’s <a href="https://law.stanford.edu/juelsgaard-intellectual-property-and-innovation-clinic/">Juelsgaard Clinic</a>, and UC Law SF’s <a href="https://www.uclawsf.edu/center-for-constitutional-democracy/">Center for Constitutional Democracy</a>.</p>
<p>The amicus brief explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>This case implicates critical questions about whether a California privacy law, enacted to protect people from harmful surveillance, is not just words on paper, but can be an effective tool for people to protect their rights and safety.</p>
<p>California’s Constitution and laws empower people to challenge harmful surveillance at its inception without waiting for its repercussions to manifest through additional harms. A foundation for these protections is article I, section 1, which grants Californians an inalienable right to privacy.</p>
<p>People in the state have long used this constitutional right to challenge the privacy-invading collection of information by private and governmental parties, not only harms that are financial, mental, or physical. Indeed, widely understood notions of privacy harm, as well as references to harm in the California Code, also demonstrate that term’s expansive meaning.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>What’s At Stake</h4>
<p>The defendant, Digital Recognition Network, also known as <a href="https://drndata.com/">DRN Data</a>, is a subsidiary of Motorola Solutions that provides access to a massive searchable database of ALPR data collected by private contractors. Its customers include law enforcement agencies and private companies, such as insurers, lenders, and repossession firms. DRN is the sister company to the infamous surveillance vendor <a href="https://drndata.com/blog/vigilant-solutions-bolsters-commercial-lpr-database-agreement-plate-locate/">Vigilant Solutions</a> (now Motorola Solutions), and together they have <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/ICE-to-see-car-locations-through-Bay-Area-12529140.php">provided data to ICE</a> through a contract with <a href="https://www.aclunc.org/docs/DOCS_031319.pdf">Thomson Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>The consequences of weak privacy protections are already playing out across the country. This year alone, authorities in multiple states have used license plate readers to hunt for <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/05/she-got-abortion-so-texas-cop-used-83000-cameras-track-her-down">people seeking reproductive healthcare</a>. Police officers have used these systems to <a href="https://local12.com/news/nation-world/police-chief-gets-caught-using-license-plate-cameras-to-track-his-ex-girlfriend-228-times-arrests-charges-probation-flock-safety-follow-stalk-new-boyfriend-broke-up-out-of-town-misuse">stalk romantic partners</a> and <a href="https://www.404media.co/california-cops-investigate-immigration-protest-with-ai-camera-system/">monitor political activists</a>. ICE has tapped into these networks to <a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-taps-into-nationwide-ai-enabled-camera-network-data-shows/">track down immigrants</a> and their families for deportation.</p>
<h4>Strong Privacy Laws</h4>
<p>This case could determine whether privacy laws have real teeth or are just words on paper. If corporations can collect your personal information with impunity—knowing that unless you can prove bodily injury or economic loss, you can’t fight back—then privacy laws lose value.</p>
<p>We need <a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/privacy-first-better-way-address-online-harms">strong data privacy laws</a>. We need a <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/01/you-should-have-right-sue-companies-violate-your-privacy">private right of action</a> so when a company violates our data privacy rights, we can sue them. We need a broad definition of “harm,” so we can sue over our lost privacy rights, without having to prove collateral injury. EFF wages this battle when <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/07/americans-deserve-more-current-american-data-privacy-protection-act">writing privacy laws</a>, when <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/01/victory-illinois-supreme-court-protects-biometric-privacy">interpreting those laws</a>, and when asserting “standing” in <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/04/our-privacy-act-lawsuit-against-doge-and-opm-why-judge-let-it-move-forward">federal</a> and <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/12/california-courts-must-protect-data-privacy">state</a> courts.</p>
<p>The fight for privacy isn’t just about legal technicalities. It’s about preserving your right to move through the world without being constantly tracked, catalogued, and profiled by corporations looking to profit from your personal information.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><header></header><section><p>Many software engineers are fatalistic about company politics. They believe that it’s pointless to get involved, because<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical decisions are often made for <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45441068">completely selfish reasons</a> that cannot be influenced by a well-meaning engineer</li>
<li>Powerful stakeholders are typically <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45442587">so stupid and dysfunctional</a> that it’s effectively impossible for you to identify their needs and deliver solutions to them</li>
<li>The political game being played depends on private information that software engineers do not have, so any attempt to get involved will result in just blundering around</li>
<li>Managers and executives spend most of their time playing politics, while engineers spend most of their time doing engineering, so engineers are at a serious political disadvantage before they even start</li>
</ul>
<p>The general idea here is that <strong>software engineers are simply not equipped to play the game at the same level as real political operators</strong>. This is true! It would be a terrible mistake for a software engineer to think that you ought to start scheming and plotting like you’re in <em>Game of Thrones</em>. Your schemes will be immediately uncovered and repurposed to your disadvantage and other people’s gain. Scheming takes practice and power, and neither of those things are available to software engineers.</p>
<p>It is simply a fact that software engineers are tools in the political game being played at large companies, not players in their own right. However, there are many ways to get involved in politics without scheming.</p>
<p>The easiest way is to <strong>actively work to make a high-profile project successful</strong>. This is more or less what you ought to be doing anyway, just as part of your ordinary job. If your company is heavily investing in some new project - these days, likely an AI project - using your engineering skill to make it successful<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> is a politically advantageous move for whatever VP or executive is spearheading that project. In return, you’ll get the rewards that executives can give at tech companies: bonuses, help with promotions, and positions on future high-profile projects. I wrote about this almost a year ago in <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/ratchet-effects"><em>Ratchet effects determine engineer reputation at large companies</em></a>.</p>
<p>A slightly harder way (but one that gives you more control) is to <strong>make your pet idea available for an existing political campaign</strong>. Suppose you’ve wanted for a while to pull out some existing functionality into its own service. There are two ways to make that happen.</p>
<p>The hard way is to expend your own political capital: drum up support, let your manager know how important it is to you, and slowly wear doubters down until you can get the project formally approved. The easy way is to <strong>allow some executive to spend their (much greater) political capital on your project</strong>. You wait until there’s a company-wide mandate for some goal that aligns with your project (say, a push for reliability, which often happens in the wake of a high-profile incident). Then you suggest to your manager that your project might be a good fit for this. If you’ve gauged it correctly, your org will get behind your project. Not only that, but it’ll increase your political capital instead of you having to spend it.</p>
<p>Organizational interest comes in waves. When it’s reliability time, VPs are desperate to be <em>doing something</em>. They want to come up with plausible-sounding reliability projects that they can fund, because they need to go to their bosses and point at what they’re doing for reliability, but they don’t have the skillset to do it on their own. They’re typically happy to fund anything that the engineering team suggests. On the other hand, when the organization’s attention is focused somewhere else - say, on a big new product ship - the last thing they want is for engineers to spend their time on an internal reliability-focused refactor that’s invisible to customers.</p>
<p>So if you want to get something technical done in a tech company, <strong>you ought to wait for the appropriate wave</strong>. It’s a good idea to prepare multiple technical programs of work, all along different lines. Strong engineers will do some of this kind of thing as an automatic process, simply by noticing things in the normal line of work. For instance, you might have rough plans:</p>
<ul>
<li>to migrate the billing code to stored-data-updated-by-webhooks instead of cached API calls</li>
<li>to rip out the ancient hand-rolled build pipeline and replace it with Vite</li>
<li>to rewrite a crufty high-volume Python service in Golang</li>
<li>to replace the slow CMS frontend that backs your public documentation with a fast static site</li>
</ul>
<p>When executives are concerned about billing, you can offer the billing refactor as a reliability improvement. When they’re concerned about developer experience, you can suggest replacing the build pipeline. When customers are complaining about performance, you can point to the Golang rewrite as a good option. When the CEO checks the state of the public documentation and is embarrassed, you can make the case for rebuilding it as a static site. <strong>The important thing is to have a detailed, effective program of work ready to go for whatever the flavor of the month is.</strong></p>
<p>Some program of work will be funded whether you do this or not. However, if you don’t do this, you have no control over what that program is. In my experience, <strong>this is where companies make their worst technical decisions</strong>: when the political need to do <em>something</em> collides with a lack of any good ideas. When there are no good ideas, a bad idea will do, in a pinch. But nobody prefers this outcome. It’s bad for the executives, who then have to sell a disappointing technical outcome as if it were a success<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup>, and it’s bad for the engineers, who have to spend their time and effort building the wrong idea.</p>
<p>If you’re a very senior engineer, the VPs (or whoever) will quietly blame you for this. They’ll be right to! <strong>Having the right idea handy at the right time is your responsibility.</strong></p>
<p>You can view all this in two different ways. Cynically, you can read this as a suggestion to make yourself a convenient tool for the sociopaths who run your company to use in their endless internecine power struggles. Optimistically, you can read this as a suggestion to let executives set the overall priorities for the company - that’s their job, after all - and to tailor your own technical plans to fit<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>. Either way, you’ll achieve more of your technical goals if you push the right plan at the right time.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Self-hosting an email server is useful for automating tasks like mailing lists, newsletters, or email verification APIs.
</p>

<p>
The elephant in the room is real-world deliverability. <b>With self-hosting you risk not receiving mail or someone missing your mail.</b> I accept this for my personal projects, but you may not. Keep this in mind.
</p>

<p>
For me the selling point of self-hosting is that it’s practically free. If you’re already self-hosting a website, installing some extra packages on your server and just a bit of your time is all that’s required. Mail takes very little storage and the software is light, so you’re unlikely to significantly change energy consumption or disk usage.
</p>

<p>
For the longest time, I perceived self-hosting email as too difficult, but after doing it for one of my projects, I can say it’s not much harder or more time-consuming than configuring some email SaaS.
</p>

<p>
I changed my goals a bit to make the setup easier though. Self-hosting a multi-user webmail looks heavy and is more involved than I was willing to get into, so I just skipped it. That way, I didn’t have to bother with user accounts, databases, or the web at all, and the task became easy.
</p>

<p>
With my config, manually sending and receiving email is possible if you SSH to your mail server and use the minimal sendmail or mailx commands, or Mutt if you like TUI. The setup is enough for me now, but I could expand it in the future, and multi-user webmail isn’t off the table anyway. Maybe I’ll even write a simple webmail package myself!
</p>


<h2>Setting up Postfix</h2>

<p>
You just need to open port 25, and install and configure <a href="https://www.postfix.org/">Postfix</a> and <a href="http://www.opendkim.org/">OpenDKIM</a> on your machine. Postfix is a complete SMTP server, and is enough for basic mail alone, but in practice you also need OpenDKIM to get your mail delivered to popular services like Gmail.
</p>

<p>
Here's my Postfix config to show how easy it is. I left the master.cf file as it was, because I’m always submitting email locally. Notice there's no mention of POP3 or IMAP. I didn't set them up, because I didn't need them.
</p>

<p>
The default alias and header check config files are practically self-explanatory (just open them and read the comments!).
</p>

<details>
<summary>/etc/postfix/main.cf</summary>
<pre>compatibility_level = 3.8
mail_owner = postfix

myhostname = mx.idx.cy
myorigin = idx.cy
mydestination = localhost, idx.cy, maxadamski.com, localchat.cc
inet_interfaces = all
inet_protocols = ipv4

# Addresses
alias_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/aliases
alias_database = $alias_maps
recipient_delimiter = +

# I'm the only user on my machine, so I send from whichever address I want.
#smtpd_sender_login_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sender_login_maps
#smtpd_sender_restrictions = reject_authenticated_sender_login_mismatch

# spam
#in_flow_delay = 1s
header_checks = regexp:/etc/postfix/header_checks
setgid_group = postdrop

# TLS (strict)
smtpd_tls_cert_file = /etc/ssl/tls/mx.idx.cy.crt
smtpd_tls_key_file = /etc/ssl/tls/mx.idx.cy.key
smtpd_tls_security_level = encrypt
smtpd_tls_mandatory_protocols = !SSLv2, !SSLv3, !TLSv1, !TLSv1.1
smtpd_tls_protocols = !SSLv2, !SSLv3, !TLSv1, !TLSv1.1
smtp_tls_security_level = encrypt
smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols = !SSLv2, !SSLv3, !TLSv1, !TLSv1.1
smtp_tls_protocols = !SSLv2, !SSLv3, !TLSv1, !TLSv1.1

# DKIM
smtpd_milters = inet:localhost:8891
non_smtpd_milters = inet:localhost:8891
milter_default_action = accept
</pre>
</details>

<h2>TLS</h2>

<p>
You will also need an SSL certificate for encryption in transit. I hate getting and renewing SSL certificates, because the tools are bulky and automation is yet another moving part in your system (I used the lego package, with the manual DNS challenge for simplicity, but I’m not too happy about it). I won’t give you a tutorial on getting SSL certificates, but note that you don’t have to get and renew a certificate for each of your custom domains!
</p>

<p>
You just need one SSL certificate for your machine to encrypt data in transit to other SMTP servers. If you create an A record mx.example.com pointing to your email machine’s IP address, then grab a free certificate for mx.example.com from Let’s Encrypt. Then point to it in the Postfix configuration, and you’ve got transport encryption! In short, only the MX hostname needs a cert for STARTTLS to be used for encryption.
</p>

<p>
Why no certificates for your actual email domains like example.com? Because the email domain has little to do with transport encryption. TLS only secures the connection between servers. You can still set whatever you want in the From header.
</p>

<h2>DKIM, SPF, and DMARC</h2>

<p>
You should prove that your emails actually come from your domain to make your mail trustworthy and deliver to Gmail and co. That’s what DKIM is for, and fortunately it’s a one-time deal per email domain. First you generate a key pair for each domain with OpenDKIM, and then you publish the public key in a TXT record in DNS. The keys don’t expire automatically, but it’s best practice to rotate them periodically. My config uses a naming scheme that allows smooth rotation, but it doesn’t complicate things if you skip it.
</p>

<p>
There are two more TXT records that you need to publish in DNS: the SPF and DMARC records. You say which hosts are allowed to send mail from your email domain, and give instructions to other email servers about what to do with mail that fails DKIM checks. In my case I told others to reject mail that can’t be verified as coming from my domains, and send reports to my postmaster address.
</p>

<p>
Take a look at my OpenDKIM config to understand how things come together.

localhost

</details>

<p>
I generate DKIM keys with the following command:
</p>

<pre>opendkim-genkey -D /etc/opendkim/keys/example.com -d example.com -s key1
</pre>

<p>
And for each email domain I have the following records in DNS:
</p>

<div>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Type</th><th>Name</th><th>Value</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>MX</td><td>example.com</td><td>mx.idx.cy</td></tr>
    <tr><td>TXT</td><td>example.com</td><td>v=spf1 mx a -all</td></tr>
    <tr><td>TXT</td><td>key1._domainkey</td><td>v=DKIM1; k=rsa; s=email; p=&lt;public-key&gt;</td></tr>
    <tr><td>TXT</td><td>_dmarc</td><td>v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:postmaster@idx.cy</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

<h2>Reverse DNS</h2>

<p>
One more thing about email trust. I've read that reverse DNS (PTR record) will boost the reputation of your email server. The thing is that your ISP has to set it up, and I suspect my ISP to reply with a polite "no", so I didn't do it yet. As you'll see in the next section, my email gets delivered to Gmail just fine. GMX and outlook.com also didn't mark my mail as spam. I also managed to sign up to reddit.com using my idx.cy email (I received the verification code without delay).
</p>

<p>
However, if you want wide deliverability, PTR isn't optional.
</p>

<h2>Testing with Gmail</h2>

<p>To try it out, let's send a test mail to Gmail with the sendmail command:</p>

<pre>sendmail -vt &lt; test.mail</pre>

<details>
<summary>test.mail</summary>
<pre>Content-Type: text/html
From: max@idx.cy
To: myaddress@gmail.com
Subject: DKIM test
Test message from idx.cy!
</pre>
</details>

<p>I got the mail instantly and Gmail confirmed TLS encryption.</p>

<img src="https://maxadamski.com/blog/2025/10/test-mail-1.png">

<p>Click "Show original" in Gmail to see the raw mail. There's lots of text in the headers, so let's just focus on passing SPF, DKIM, and DMARC :)</p>

<img src="https://maxadamski.com/blog/2025/10/test-mail-2.png">

<p>You'll also get a mail with a report because of the <tt>-v</tt> option. I receive mail with Heirloom Mail like this:</p>

<pre>You have new mail in /var/mail/max
fool ~ | mailx
Heirloom Mail version 12.5 7/5/10.  Type ? for help.
"/var/mail/max": 1 message 1 new
&gt;N  1 Mail Delivery System  Sat Oct  4 15:40  74/2437  "Mail Delivery Status Report"
</pre>

<p>I use the <tt>p</tt> command to print the mail.</p>

<p>Great, everything is working! And I'm feeling the spirit of the 80s thanks to mailx :)</p>

<p>
If something isn't working for you, please double-check your DNS records, and triple-check that TLS certificates are readable by the Postfix user, and that DKIM keys are readable by the OpenDKIM user. Postfix and OpenDKIM logs will also be useful. The OpenDKIM config file is especially unforgiving of typos, so watch out for small mistakes!
</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>
In my next post on email, I'll show you how to use Python to build useful email applications. Thanks for reading!
</p>

<p>
Btw, if you notice anything about my config (or just want to share some thoughts) just email me at <a href="mailto:max@idx.cy">max@idx.cy</a> :)

  <div><p><span>Flock Safety, the police technology company most notable for their extensive network of </span><a href="https://sls.eff.org/technologies/automated-license-plate-readers-alprs"><span>automated license plate readers</span></a><span> spread throughout the United States, is rolling out a new and troubling product that may create headaches for the cities that adopt it: detection of “human distress” via audio. As part of their suite of technologies, Flock has been pushing </span><a href="https://www.flocksafety.com/webinar/introducing-raven"><span>Raven</span></a><span>, their version of </span><a href="https://sls.eff.org/technologies/gunshot-detection"><span>acoustic gunshot detection</span></a><span>. These devices capture sounds in public places and use machine learning to try to identify gunshots and then alert police—but EFF has </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/07/its-time-police-stop-using-shotspotter"><span>long warned</span></a><span> that they are also high powered microphones parked above densely-populated city streets. Cities now have one more reason to follow the lead of </span><a href="https://www.kvue.com/article/news/local/austin-license-plate-readers-ends-privacy-concerns/269-4dc64690-c6c0-4ace-a009-fd8a13f69113"><span>many other municipalities</span></a><span> and cancel their Flock contracts, before this new feature causes civil liberties harms to residents and headaches for cities.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In marketing materials, Flock has been touting new features to their Raven product—including the ability of the device to alert police based on sounds, including “distress.” The </span><a href="https://www.flocksafety.com/distress-early-access"><span>online ad</span></a><span> for the product, which allows cities to apply for early access to the technology, shows the image of police getting an alert for “screaming.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It’s unclear how this technology works. For acoustic gunshot detection, generally the microphones are looking for sounds that would signify gunshots (though in practice they often mistake car backfires or fireworks for gunshots). Flock needs to come forward now with an explanation of exactly how their new technology functions. It is unclear how these devices will interact with state “</span><a href="https://www.mwl-law.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/RECORDING-CONVERSATIONS-CHART.pdf"><span>eavesdropping</span></a><span>” laws that limit listening to or recording the private conversations that often take place in public.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Flock is no stranger to causing legal challenges for the cities and states that adopt their products. In Illinois, Flock was </span><a href="https://www.25newsnow.com/2025/08/28/hundreds-police-departments-use-camera-company-accused-breaking-state-law/"><span>accused of violating state law</span></a><span> by allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a federal agency, access to license plate reader data taken within the state. That’s not all. In 2023, a North Carolina judge halted the installation of Flock cameras statewide for </span><a href="https://www.govtech.com/public-safety/north-carolina-judge-halts-alpr-deployment-over-licensing"><span>operating in the state without a license</span></a><span>. When the city of Evanston, Illinois recently canceled its contract with Flock, it ordered the company to take down their license plate readers–only for Flock to </span><a href="https://evanstonroundtable.com/2025/09/25/city-covers-up-flock-cameras-while-waiting-for-removal/"><span>mysteriously reinstall</span></a><span> them a few days later. This city has now sent Flock a cease and desist order and in the meantime, has put </span><a href="https://evanstonroundtable.com/2025/09/25/city-covers-up-flock-cameras-while-waiting-for-removal/"><span>black tape over the cameras</span></a><span>. For some, the technology isn’t worth its mounting downsides. As one </span><a href="https://derekeder.com/blog/why-i-voted-to-cancel-flock"><span>Illinois village trustee wrote </span></a><span>while explaining his vote to cancel the city’s contract with Flock, “According to our own Civilian Police Oversight Commission, over 99% of Flock alerts do not result in any police action.”</span></p>
<p><br><span>Gunshot detection technology is dangerous enough as it is—police showing up to alerts they think are gunfire only to find children playing with fireworks is a recipe for innocent people to get hurt. This isn’t hypothetical: in Chicago a </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/03/responding-shotspotter-police-shoot-child-lighting-fireworks"><span>child really was shot at by police</span></a><span> who thought they were responding to a shooting thanks to a ShotSpotter alert. Introducing a new feature that allows these pre-installed Raven microphones all over cities to begin listening for human voices in distress is likely to open up a whole new can of unforeseen legal, civil liberties, and even bodily safety consequences. </span></p>
