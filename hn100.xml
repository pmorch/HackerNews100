                  <p><span>Yup, there's an increasing amount of GPU use these days, mostly related to soup searching -- see <a href="https://catagolue.hatsya.com/home" rel="nofollow">https://catagolue.hatsya.com/home</a> for the software and a tabulation of results from the last several years of collaborative searching.<p>Caching is very very heavily used for running the biggest universes, which are truly mind-bendingly large.  Golly's "HashLife" algorithm can in practice handle patterns that are over a trillion cells in each dimension:</p><pre><code>  https://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?&amp;p=153609#p153609
</code></pre>
Patterns with interesting behavior very often have a lot of repeating patterns, with the interesting stuff happening as complex interactions between those predictable patterns. HashLife capitalizes on remembering interactions that it has seen before, so basically the more memory your computer has available, the better HashLife will do in the long run at simulating that type of pattern.</span></p></div></td></tr>

But for abstract mathematics the “street cred” follows three rules: you get more cred based on,</p><p>• the wimpier the building blocks look</p><p>• the larger and more complex the structures you can build with them</p><p>• the more memorable or intuitive the blocks are (so like marketing... SK-calculus is the same as lambda calculus but lambda can say “I am the abstract mathematics of template substitution!” while SK-calculus can't, directly.)</p><p>All a way to say that the field is full of “fun little toys” and the key about criterion (2) is that we have figured out how to build structures of arbitrary complexity in Life, because we have discovered it is Turing-complete. It therefore is also NP-hard and a lot of other good stuff. Really revitalized work into cellular automata by giving some good marketing, which led to Stephen Wolfram's success etc etc.

This feature is to prevent one from “washing” a note and printing a different value as is done with $5 and $100 US bills for instance as the copper pour is “baked” into the medium.</p><p>Writing a python script to encode arbitrary numbers into a Game of Life program was a very fun distraction during an otherwise thorny project that involved connecting people from the print world to people from the electronics world.

Carter Bays did some investigations and published papers back in the 1980's:<pre><code>  https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Three-dimensional_cellular_automaton
</code></pre>
There's been a little bit of revived interest lately, when newer versions of Golly ( <a href="https://golly.sourceforge.io/" rel="nofollow">https://golly.sourceforge.io/</a> ) started to include at least some support for 3D rules. Other programs have been showing up recently, though some of them are more ways of visualizing the history of a 2-dimensional rule in three dimensions.<p>There are a couple of big difficulties that seem to prevent 3D rules from getting a lot of attention.  It's just plain a lot more computationally intensive to emulate 3D rules.  Also it's a lot harder to see what's going on in the middle of an active 3D pattern -- a lot of the detail tends to get hidden.

It's a mind-bending result -- partly just a mathematical trick, since you end up encoding a whole lot of information in the space between the gliders -- but it's just really amazing that all the details have actually been figured out to make the trick work, and that it's possible to simulate the whole process on a personal computer.</span></p></div></td></tr>

            <span>Abstract:</span>We show that Claude 3 Opus, a large language model (LLM) released by Anthropic in March 2024, exhibits stronger machine translation competence than other LLMs. Though we find evidence of data contamination with Claude on FLORES-200, we curate new benchmarks that corroborate the effectiveness of Claude for low-resource machine translation into English. We find that Claude has remarkable \textit{resource efficiency} -- the degree to which the quality of the translation model depends on a language pair's resource level. Finally, we show that advancements in LLM translation can be compressed into traditional neural machine translation (NMT) models. Using Claude to generate synthetic data, we demonstrate that knowledge distillation advances the state-of-the-art in Yoruba-English translation, meeting or surpassing strong baselines like NLLB-54B and Google Translate.

                <p>If you’ve been making websites for years, you know how frustrating it was to lay out a web page with CSS floats. Managing sizes and placement was tedious and time consuming. Being creative was often impossible. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Basic_concepts_of_grid_layout">CSS Grid</a> greatly eased that pain with Grid Level 1 in <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-grid">2017</a>, and <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-subgrid">now</a> with Grid Level 2, aka <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Subgrid">Subgrid</a>. But even with the powerful CSS of today, not every layout imaged by designers is possible. In fact, when CSS Grid shipped, one of the most commonly asked questions was: “how do I write CSS to accomplish a masonry layout?” Sadly, for the last seven years the answer has been — you can’t.</p>
<h2><a name="what-is-masonry-layout"></a>What is masonry layout?</h2>
<p>What do we mean by the term “masonry layout”? Basically it’s the pattern seen in the following image — where content packs together like a brick or stone wall. That’s where it gets the name “masonry”. It’s also frequently called “<a href="https://github.com/topics/waterfall-layout">waterfall layout</a>”, as a metaphor for how content flows down the page like a waterfall.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image1-masonry-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image1-masonry-light.png" alt="Two dozen photos of different aspect ratios laid out using a &quot;masonry&quot; pattern"></picture></figure>
<p>This layout is popular because it solves a few problems that other layouts do not.</p>
<ol>
<li>It allows for content of different aspect ratios, and avoids the need to crop or truncate content in order to turn everything into uniform rectangles.</li>
<li>It distributes content across the page (instead of flowing down each column, one by one). This follows the natural reading order as you scroll the page. And it lets the website lazy-load additional content at the bottom without moving existing content around.</li>
</ol>
<p>This layout creates uniformly-sized columns, without any rows. It’s quite possible that because this layout has required JavaScript, anything more creative or complex has been too hard to pull off — and we’ve been left with an expectation that masonry layout should only ever be a simple pattern with uniformly-sized columns. Let’s see what’s possible if we build it into CSS instead.</p>
<h2><a name="inventing-masonry"></a>Inventing masonry</h2>
<p>A mechanism in CSS for “masonry layout” was first proposed by Mozilla in January 2020 as an extension of CSS Grid, and <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_grid-template-rows_masonry">implemented</a> as an experiment behind a flag in Firefox Nightly. In 2022, Apple started implementing this <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid-3/">CSS Grid Level 3</a> proposal in Safari Technology Preview (where it’s currently on by default), and we’ve been helping to move the web standard along to reach maturity.</p>
<p>However, there are big questions still being asked about how CSS should handle masonry-style layouts. Some people remain skeptical that this capability should be part of CSS Grid, and want it to instead be its own separate <code>display</code> type. Others are questioning whether or not this kind of layout is needed on the web at all — they aren’t sure that well-known websites will use it. With such fundamental disagreements at play, no browser can ship. We must first come to consensus in the CSS Working Group.</p>
<p>This is where we need your help. We’d like real-world web designers and developers to weigh into the discussion, and express what it is that you want. Your input really can make a difference.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll walk through how the CSS Grid Level 3 proposal works, and how you can use its new capabilities. We’ll show you why we believe these features should be part of CSS Grid, and explain what the alternative would be if the CSS Working Group creates <code>display: masonry</code> instead. And then, we’ll ask you to join the debate to help move us forward. Please do read to the end.</p>
<h2><a name="four-demos"></a>Four demos</h2>
<p>To show why we at Apple believe this capability should be part of CSS Grid, we created four demonstrations. If you’d like, try them yourself at <a href="https://webkit.org/demos/grid3/">webkit.org/demos/grid3</a>. View these demos in a <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_grid-template-rows_masonry">browser that supports Grid Level 3</a> — currently <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a> or Firefox after you’ve turned on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Experimental_features#masonry_grid_layout">the feature flag</a>.</p>
<p>Note there’s a control panel for each demo, with the relevant layout code printed to the page. Turn on “Number items” to see the relationship between the HTML order of content and the layout placement of that content.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image4-controlsalternate-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image4-controlsalternate-light.png" alt="Screenshot showing the controls of the demo — here with the numbers turned on"></picture></figure>
<p>Each demo has a multitude of variations. Switch between variations from the dropdown menu, which changes only the CSS. The HTML stays the same.</p>

<h2><a name="creating-a-classic-masonry-waterfall-layout"></a>Creating a classic masonry / waterfall layout</h2>
<p>First, let’s take a look at how to build a classic masonry/waterfall layout. In this gallery of photos, each image is wrapped with a <code>figure</code> element, and the figures are direct children of a <code>main</code> element.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>main</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>figure</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;<span>img</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"photo-1.jpg"</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>figure</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>figure</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;<span>img</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"photo-2.jpg"</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>figure</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>figure</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;<span>img</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"photo-3.jpg"</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>figure</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>main</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>We start by applying <code>display: grid</code> to the main element to create the Grid container. Then we can define <code>grid-template-columns</code> however we’d like.</p>
<p>In this case, let’s use <code>grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(14rem, 1fr))</code> to ask the browser to repeat a looped definition to create a set of flexible columns that are each of a minimum of 14rem. This results in uniformly-sized columns, typical of the classic masonry/waterfall layout. The <code>gap: 1rem;</code> rule creates a 1rem-wide space between the items — both between the columns, and horizontally between items.</p>
<p>And then, we’ll define the “rows” with the <code>masonry</code> value. (It’s likely the name of this value will change before this ships in browsers — more on that at the end of this article. For now, <code>masonry</code> is what works.)</p>
<pre><code><span>main</span> { 
  <span>display</span>: <span>grid</span>;
  <span>grid-template-columns</span>: <span>repeat</span>(<span>auto-fill</span>, <span>minmax</span>(<span>14</span><span>rem</span>, <span>1</span><span>fr</span>));
  <span>gap</span>: <span>1</span><span>rem</span>;
  <span>grid-template-rows</span>: <span>masonry</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>grid-template-rows: masonry</code> rule tells the browser: “Please do <em>not</em> create rows. Instead pack the content into a masonry/waterfall-like pattern.”</p>
<p>That’s it! In four lines of CSS, with zero media queries or container queries, we’ve created a flexible layout that works on screens of all sizes. And there’s no need to crop content to force everything into same-sized boxes.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image4-masonrywider-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image4-masonrywider-light.png" alt="masonry layout of photos"></picture></figure>
<p>In graphic design, a layout that has uniformly-sized columns and no rows is often called a “symmetrical columnar grid”. For centuries, columnar grids were the dominant type of grid used in page design.</p>
<h2><a name="leveraging-grid%e2%80%99s-full-power-to-define-columns"></a>Leveraging Grid’s full power to define columns</h2>
<p>Now let’s dive into the advantages of combining the full power of CSS Grid with masonry/waterfall packing. CSS Grid provides many options for defining grid our columns. Using <code>fr</code> units to create a symmetrical grid is only one option of many.</p>
<p>How could these possibilities be used for a masonry/waterfall-style layout? Let’s try mixing fixed-sized columns with flexible columns. We could make the first and last column fixed-sized, while the middle columns are flexible, changing in both size and number.</p>
<figure><video controls="" width="1920" height="1018"><source src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/video1-firstlastsmaller-dark.m4v" type="video/mp4" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><source src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/video1-firstlastsmaller-light.m4v" type="video/mp4"></video></figure>
<p>Specifically, the first and last columns are exactly 14 characters wide, while the middle columns are flexible (at least 28 characters wide) and change in number to fill the available space.</p>
<pre><code><span>main</span> { 
  <span>display</span>: <span>grid</span>;
  <span>grid-template-columns</span>: <span>14</span><span>ch</span> <span>repeat</span>(<span>auto-fill</span>, <span>minmax</span>(<span>28</span><span>ch</span>, <span>1</span><span>fr</span>)) <span>14</span><span>ch</span>;
  <span>grid-template-rows</span>: <span>masonry</span>;
  <span>gap</span>: <span>1</span><span>rem</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is just one of many, many possibilities.</p>
<p>CSS Grid allows for a lot of creativity with its options for defining grid tracks:</p>
<ul>
<li>fixed sizes defined in any unit (px, em, rem, cqi, lh, ch, ic, cap, vw, svh, and many <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Values_and_Units#numeric_data_types">more</a>)</li>
<li><code>max-content</code> and <code>min-content</code></li>
<li>the full power of <code>fr</code> units</li>
<li><code>minmax()</code> functions</li>
<li><code>%</code>-sized </li>
<li>auto </li>
</ul>
<p>These options in CSS Grid allow you to create something much more dynamic and flexible in interesting ways. You can create two stages of flexibility, because the <code>fr</code>-unit sized columns grow and shrink in a separate stage from the <code>minmax()</code>-sized columns. The <code>max-content</code> and  <code>min-content</code> values let you size the columns based on the content size, rather than sizing the content based on the column size. The <code>fr</code> units can easily be used to create compound or asymmetrical grids, where the columns are different sizes. The options are endless.</p>
<p>By adding the ability to pack content in a masonry/waterfall pattern to CSS Grid, we maintain the full power of Grid for defining our columns in whichever manner we like.</p>
<p>For example, let’s use <code>grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(8rem, 1fr) minmax(16rem, 2fr)) minmax(8rem, 1fr)</code> to create a pattern of alternating narrow and wider columns, where all the columns are flexible. More columns are added when there’s space. And there’s always an odd number of columns, ending with a narrow one.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image5-alternatingmontage-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image5-alternatingmontage-light.png" alt="three web browser windows next to each other, showing how the layout adjusts for narrow, medium and wider windows"></picture></figure>
<p>Even when we define columns using only the simple <code>fr</code> unit, the full power provided in CSS Grid means different columns can be set to different sizes. For fun, let’s use <code>fr</code> units to define a set of columns sized to inject the vibes of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio">golden ratio</a> by using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence">Fibonacci sequence</a> in <code>grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 2fr 3fr 5fr 8fr;</code></p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image6-fibonacci-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image6-fibonacci-light.png" alt="layout of photos where the columns on the left are very narrow, getting bigger and bigger as them move to the right, in a fibonacci sequence"></picture></figure>
<p>In a more practical example, let’s use <code>max-content</code> when defining our columns. Content-based sizing is an incredibly power feature of CSS Grid. This demo of a mega menu layout uses <code>grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(max-content, 30ch));</code> to ensure that every column is big enough to fit every link without wrapping text.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image7-megamenu-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image7-megamenu-light.png" alt="a menu with a ton of links, like in a website footer, laid out with Grid Level 3"></picture></figure>
<p>Mega menus have been hard to code, especially across multiple screen sizes. With CSS Grid Level 3, it becomes incredibly easy. A few lines of code creates a dynamic layout which adds and removes columns one at a time as space allows — without any media/container queries, and with wrapping prevention.</p>
<p>Many of these examples could never be created with masonry as a separate display type. The discussion of <code>display: masonry</code> is to only allow symmetrical columns (columns that are the same size as each other), much like multicolumn layout does today.</p>
<h2><a name="leveraging-grid%e2%80%99s-ability-to-let-content-span-columns"></a>Leveraging Grid’s ability to let content span columns</h2>
<p>CSS Grid also lets us span items across multiple columns. Let’s use that capability to see what interesting options might emerge. How about making every 5th image span two grid columns, while the rest of the images are span one column.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image8-5thwider-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image8-5thwider-light.png" alt="same photo layout, now with random photos being bigger"></picture></figure>
<p>What if instead, we put a <code>wider</code> class on specifically on images that have a wider aspect-ratio, to make those images span multiple columns. We can also change the styling a bit, making the corners square instead of round, and reducing the grid gap to zero. This gives us a different way to pack photos of different aspect ratios together.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image9-wideriswider-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image9-wideriswider-light.png" alt="another layout of image, this time where wider images are wider"></picture></figure>
<p>We also experimented with combining the classic masonry/waterfall layout of photos with View Transitions. When a user  clicks/taps on any photo, it grows to span multiple columns. The browser automagically animates the transition. (This demo requires Safari Technology Preview 192 or later.)</p>
<figure><video controls="" width="1488" height="1080"><source src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/video2-viewtransitions-dark.m4v" type="video/mp4" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><source src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/video2-viewtransitions-light.m4v" type="video/mp4"></video></figure>
<p>These variations of the Photos and Mega Menu demos are just a small taste of all of the many possibilities you get when leveraging the full power of CSS Grid in the column direction, while simultaneously turning off rows.</p>
<h2><a name="columnar-vs-modular-grids"></a>Columnar vs. Modular Grids</h2>
<p>What happens when we keep experimenting? Let’s let go of thinking about “masonry”, and start imagining Grid Level 3 purely as an expansion of Grid. At its core, CSS Grid Level 3 provides a mechanism for turning off rows. It lets us create a <strong>columnar grid</strong> — a grid that’s made up of columns alone.</p>
<p>By contrast, a <strong>modular grid</strong> is a grid where everything is lined up in both columns and rows. They became popular in the 20th century during the dominance of modernism in graphic design. CSS Grid Level 1 is really good at making modular grids… that’s what it wants to do. In fact, float-based layouts also encouraged the creation of modular grids on the web, since you had to make all your content the same height to get your floats to clear. Images need to be the same aspect ratio. Text has to be the same length. This is often accomplished on the back-end with policies enforced by the content management system, or on the front-end by CSS that truncates/crops the content.</p>
<p>It’s incredible common for websites to do some variation of this sort of modular grid, laid out here with CSS Grid Level 1.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image10-textgrid1-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image10-textgrid1-light.png" alt="layout of text, in ridged sets of boxes, row after row, all the same height"></picture></figure>
<p>Of course, this example is overly simplistic. The article ledes look bare with no teaser images. The uniformity is so strict and formal, the design lacks life. Real websites find other ways to breathe life back into the design.</p>
<p>But what if the layout itself could also provide some vitality and interest? What will happen if we use CSS Grid to create a columnar grid as easily as it creates a modular grid? What if we don’t truncate content, and instead let it be the size that it wants to be — and get the layout to work for the content, rather than forcing the content to work for the layout?</p>
<p>A classic masonry/waterfall layout with various lengths of text looks like this, which is already more engaging since a user can read more about each article:</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image11-textmasonry-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image11-textmasonry-light.png" alt="same article teaser text, this time laid out in columns set with masonry"></picture></figure>
<p>Although, that’s still a bit visually repetitive. Symmetrical columnar grids often are. We need the rest of the power of CSS Grid to do something more interesting. Let’s make the latest article much bigger, and have it span four columns. A handful of other recent articles can be medium-sized and span two columns. While the older content is smaller, spanning one column.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image12-textgrid3-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image12-textgrid3-light.png" alt="same text, this time laid out with much more dynamic use of 'masonry-style layout plus spanning columns"></picture></figure>
<p>Now this otherwise visually boring text is starting to look fairly lively. If we were to add images to each of these articles, it would be it even more dynamic.</p>
<p>Let’s experiment with mixing images and text together on a webpage for a museum. The first grid item is a header that introduces the museum, and provides navigation to other resources. The rest of the content consists of pieces of artwork and their information: title, artist, year, medium, catalog number and location.</p>
<p>Because the paintings are gorgeous, the content looks pretty great in a classic masonry/waterfall layout.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image13-museummasonry.png" alt="layout of cards, each with a painting and text"></figure>
<p>Let’s see what else we can do by utilizing two more powerful features of CSS Grid — subgrid and explicit placement.</p>
<h2><a name="using-subgrid-and-explicit-placement"></a>Using subgrid and explicit placement</h2>
<p>The functionality provided by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Subgrid">subgrid</a> in CSS Grid Level 2 is incredible, and it’s <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-subgrid">finally supported</a> in most browsers.</p>
<p>Instead of listing the painting’s metadata in a single left-aligned column, let’s see how we might better use the available space. By using <code>subgrid</code>, we can put the year and catalog number on the right of each card — and line up this data for one painting with the same data for the other paintings.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image14-museumsubgridintooling.png" alt="close-up of this layout, with the Grid Inspector showing, with lines marking columns showing how subgrid works"></figure>
<p>By adding this new functionality to CSS Grid Level 3, we get the benefit of existing developer tools. You can use the Grid Inspector in Safari Technology Preview today as you try out <code>grid-template-rows: masonry</code>.</p>
<p>If masonry is its own display type, and not part of CSS Grid, it will not get the benefit of subgrid.</p>
<p>We can also use the power of CSS Grid Level 1 to explicitly place the header into the last two columns, moving it to the top right corner of the page with <code>grid-column: -3 / -1</code>.</p>
<figure><video controls="" width="1670" height="1080"><source src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/video3-museum-dark.m4v" type="video/mp4" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><source src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/video3-museum-light.m4v"></video></figure>
<p>In just a few lines of layout code, we are using the full power of CSS Grid Levels 1, 2, and 3 to create flexible columns that change in number to accommodate the available size — without using any media queries or container queries.</p>
<p>Hopefully you can see the advantages of fully combining a mechanism for masonry/waterfall layouts with CSS Grid — providing many more creative possibilities than masonry alone.</p>
<h2><a name="the-debate"></a>The Debate</h2>
<p>So let’s get into the debate that’s been blocking the CSS Working Group from moving forward. Our hope is that web designers and developers chime in (post to social media, write blog posts) with your thoughts about which direction CSS should take.</p>
<p>Some people, including those of us at Apple, like having “Masonry” be part of CSS Grid. We believe this functionality is a mechanism to expand CSS Grid — allowing it to finally create columnar grids as well as modular grids. And we want this functionality to be mixed with all the other features of Grid, including the powerful options for defining a columns, track spanning, explicit placement, and subgrid.</p>
<p>Other people instead believe Masonry should be its own separate display type. At first glance, defining Masonry with a new display type might make a lot of sense. You do get a tidy separation between layout types.</p>
<pre><code><span>display</span>: <span>block</span>;
<span>display</span>: <span>inline</span>;
<span>display</span>: <span>flexbox</span>;
<span>display</span>: <span>grid</span>;
<span>display</span>: <span>masonry</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>The CSS Working Group has not discussed how the syntax for a separate Masonry display type would work, but perhaps it would be patterned after <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_multicol_layout">Multicolumn layout</a>.</p>
<pre><code><span>main</span> { 
  <span>display</span>: <span>masonry</span>;
  <span>columns</span>: <span>28</span><span>ch</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Or perhaps the syntax would be patterned after Grid, <em>but with significant limitations</em>:</p>
<pre><code><span>main</span> {
  <span>display</span>: <span>masonry</span>;
  <span>masonry-columns</span>: <span>repeat</span>(<span>5</span>, <span>minmax</span>(<span>28</span><span>ch</span>, <span>1</span><span>fr</span>)); 
                   <span>/* where only one repeating width is allowed */</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>Either way, it’s clear that advocates of this option want Masonry to be limited to a symmetrical grid — where all the columns are the same size as each other. None of the rest of CSS Grid’s track sizing capabilities would be allowed.</p>
<p>Making masonry a simple and separate layout type would avoid the work necessary to keep Grid and Masonry working together in combination — both now and in the long term. Doing this would simplify the layout model, make it easier to implement in browsers, reduce the potential for performance traps, and allow the feature sets of Grid and Masonry to diverge.</p>
<p>Conversely, we believe the effort needed to add this capability to CSS Grid is worth the many benefits to be had. The <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid-3/">CSS Grid Level 3 specification</a> has already been written, and implemented in <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_grid-template-rows_masonry">two browser engines</a>. And yes, while making CSS Grid more complex will make it harder to extend in the future, we believe there’s an advantage to having these two types of grid layouts intertwined. This way the CSS Working Group will always define all new additions for both modular and columnar grids. There won’t be something added to <code>display: grid</code> that will be left out of <code>display: masonry</code>, or vice versa. For example, many developers want CSS Grid Level 4 to provide a mechanism for styling grid areas and grid lines — perhaps a way to add a background color to a track, or create a rule line in a gap. It’d be great to ensure that will work for both modular and columnar grids from Day 1.</p>
<p>Another argument made by advocates of <code>display: masonry</code> is that that masonry is conceptually a fundamentally different layout type from CSS Grid, and therefore should have its own display type. They often describe CSS Grid as inherently being about “lining things up in two-dimensions”, and since masonry only lines things up in one dimension, “it’s not a grid”. (In fact, some have advocated that Masonry is more like Flexbox, since “both line things up in one direction”.)</p>
<p>In many ways, your perspective on this question might depends on what you imagine a grid is.</p>
<h2><a name="what-is-a-grid"></a>What is a grid?</h2>
<p>Grids are an incredibly important aspect of graphic design. Grids are used to line up text, images and other content in a regular pattern. They help readability and usability by making things predictable.</p>
<p>You can trace their use through thousands of years of history.</p>

Seen in <i>Books: A Living History</i> by Martyn Lyons, 2011.</figcaption></figure>
<p>It wasn’t until the 20th century that European and American modernists started promoting the idea that “proper” graphic design grids should line content up in both directions — in rows as well as columns.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image16-vignelligrids.jpg" alt="spread from a book, showing two different newspaper home pages, where articles line up in a modular grid — in both row and column directions" width="1500" height="1125" srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image16-vignelligrids.jpg 1500w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image16-vignelligrids-300x225.jpg 300w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image16-vignelligrids-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image16-vignelligrids-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"><figcaption>Massimo Vignelli is especially well-known for promoting the idea that lining things up in both columns and rows is a superior practice of graphic design. Two examples from <i>The Vignelli Canon</i>, 2010.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Even today, there is a lot of debate about which type of grid is the best grid or the only legitimate grid. Many designers claim a 12 column grid is the only correct way to design a web page — or 12 columns for “desktop”, 8 columns for “tablet”, and 4 columns for “phones”. At times designers have gotten quite religious about their ideas of what a “proper grid” looks like.</p>
<p><a href="https://markboulton.co.uk/journal/five-simple-steps-to-designing-grid-systems-part-1/">Mark Boulton</a> argued for years that symmetrical columnar grids are incredibly formulaic and boring. He promoted the use of asymmetrical compound grids in design for the web. Today, luckily CSS Grid Level 1 makes it incredibly easy to create both asymmetrical grids and compound grids, giving designers the freedom to create what they want. But only if they also want all their grids to be a modular grids.</p>
<p>Both modular and columnar grids are in fact grids. And CSS Grid deserves the ability to also create columnar grids.</p>

White.</figcaption></figure>
<p>We believe there’s an opportunity for CSS to enable a rich history of design grids to come to the web — and would be greatly disappointed to see the new masonry feature limited to only allowing symmetrical columnar grids.</p>
<p>But what do you think?</p>
<h2><a name="we-want-to-hear-from-you"></a>We want to hear from you</h2>
<p>This is where you come in. Try some demos of your own. Write about your thoughts on your own blog. <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/10233">Comment at the CSS Working Group in this issue</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Should “masonry”/“waterfall” be part of CSS Grid?</li>
<li>Do you want the capabilities to define a columnar grid with CSS Grid — to use subgrid, spanning, explicit placement, and all the many options for track sizing? Or do you only want the ability to define a classic masonry layout with equal-sized columns?</li>
<li>Will you use this? What might you create with it?</li>
<li>Do you have links to demos you’ve made?  We want to see your ideas and use cases.</li>
<li>Are there things you want to do that you can’t do with this model?</li>
</ul>
<p>Often, thinking about something theoretically and actually seeing it in use can be very different. To make sure the CSSWG gets the design of this feature correct, we need developers to gain some hands-on experience, and articulate your thoughts about what it’s like.</p>
<p>The WebKit team has been working on Masonry for a year and a half. It was first enabled by default in <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/13839/release-notes-for-safari-technology-preview-163/">Safari Technology Preview 163</a> in February 2023. There’s a bit more polish needed, and details to work out (naming being one). But we would like to ship this feature soon. To do so, these fundamental questions need to be resolved.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help!</p>
<h2><a name="p-s-about-the-name%e2%80%a6"></a>P.S. About the name…</h2>
<p>It’s likely <code>masonry</code> is not the best name for this new value. Names in CSS are usually simple words that directly describe the result they create — like <code>center</code>, <code>under</code>, <code>contain</code>, <code>clip</code>, <code>revert</code>, <code>ltr</code>, <code>always</code>, <code>break-word</code>, <code>hidden</code>, <code>allow-end</code>, <code>scale-down</code>, <code>wrap</code>, <code>smooth</code>.</p>
<p>The word “masonry” is more of a metaphor, where the meaning has to be explained with a backstory. Such a term is harder to remember for developers who do not speak English. And arguably, the syntax could just as easily be <code>grid-template-rows: waterfall</code> instead, since that’s the dominant word for this layout used in certain regions, not masonry.</p>
<p>Plus, once you start to write a lot of code using this feature, it’s likely you’ll come to the realization that we did — this really isn’t about the layout used by Pinterest or other similar sites. This is a mechanism for telling the browser, “please create a grid, but <em>without any rows.</em>”</p>
<p>Perhaps the best syntax could be <code>grid-template-rows: none;</code> to convey “please do not give me any rows”. Sadly, it’s too late to use this name, because <code>none</code> is the default value for <code>grid-template-*</code> and means “please give me only implicit rows, no explicit ones”.</p>
<p>Instead we could use the name <code>off</code> to convey “please turn off the grid in the row direction, and give me only columns”.</p>
<pre><code><span>main</span> { 
  <span>display</span>: <span>grid</span>;
  <span>grid-template-columns</span>: <span>repeat</span>(<span>auto-fill</span>, <span>minmax</span>(<span>14</span><span>rem</span>, <span>1</span><span>fr</span>));
  <span>grid-template-rows</span>: <span>off</span>; 
}
</code></pre>
<p>The CSSWG is debating this name in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/9733">this issue</a>. If you have ideas or preferences for a name, please join that discussion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <code>masonry</code> is the value that is currently implemented in Safari Technology Preview, since that’s what the Editor’s Draft currently uses. And so that’s what we used in our demos above, and what you should use in yours. But do expect the name of this value to change in the future. And perhaps prepare for a future where we call this “columnar grid” or “Grid Level 3” instead of “Masonry”.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>We introduce phi-3-mini, a 3.8 billion parameter language model trained on 3.3 trillion tokens, whose overall performance, as measured by both academic benchmarks and internal testing, rivals that of models such as Mixtral 8x7B and GPT-3.5 (e.g., phi-3-mini achieves 69% on MMLU and 8.38 on MT-bench), despite being small enough to be deployed on a phone. The innovation lies entirely in our dataset for training, a scaled-up version of the one used for phi-2, composed of heavily filtered web data and synthetic data. The model is also further aligned for robustness, safety, and chat format. We also provide some initial parameter-scaling results with a 7B and 14B models trained for 4.8T tokens, called phi-3-small and phi-3-medium, both significantly more capable than phi-3-mini (e.g., respectively 75% and 78% on MMLU, and 8.7 and 8.9 on MT-bench).

	<div>
		<p>Starting Tuesday, March 19, The Seattle Public Library is reducing the number of maximum holds allowed on e-books and e-audiobooks from 25 to 10.</p>
<p>Please note that if you have more than 10 holds on digital books at that time, you won’t lose any of these holds. You just won’t be able to place new holds until you’re within the new limit. Also, the limit for digital borrowing has not changed – you can still borrow up to 25 digital books at a time.</p>
<p>While the vast majority of our patrons won’t be affected by this change, we want to explain why the Library needed to reduce the holds limit to manage spending and meet increasing patron interest in digital books. In the Q&amp;A below, we also share some tips for alternative tools you can use for tracking books you want to read and making the most of your Library account.</p>
<p><b>Why did the Library need to make this change? </b></p>
<p>If you’ve started borrowing digital books from the Library in recent years, you’ve been part of the biggest shift in library lending in recent history.</p>
<p>Although the popularity of digital books was rising before 2020, the pandemic accelerated this trend. At The Seattle Public Library, annual checkouts of digital books almost tripled from 2015 to 2022, as did costs.</p>
<p>The Library has increased investment in digital collections to meet patron interest. Unfortunately, because of the way digital books are priced for libraries, meeting increased demand has come at a cost that has become unsustainable.</p>
<p><b>Why are digital books so expensive? </b></p>
<p>As a consumer, when you buy an e-book or e-audiobook, it costs about the same or sometimes even less than the print book version. But for libraries, the e-book or e-audiobook version of a title actually costs up to three times or more than the print version.</p>
<p>This is because publishers use a licensing model for selling e-books to libraries. Each copy of a digital book title requires a purchase of a license. While there are many types of licenses, the most common license needs to be purchased and then re-purchased every year.</p>
<p><b>What do holds have to do with the cost of digital books? </b></p>
<p>This may seem surprising, but patron holds are the single biggest factor in rising costs. To maintain reasonable wait times, the Library buys additional licenses of a digital title when patrons place more holds on it. That means that when hundreds of patrons place holds on a single New York Times bestseller, the costs of “buying down the holds” can quickly become astronomical.</p>
<p>In 2023, 62% of the Library’s spending on digital books was used to purchase additional copies to fulfill holds placed on popular titles.</p>
<p><span id="more-84381"></span>As you can see in the chart below, Library costs for meeting increased patron interest in popular e-books have nearly tripled since 2015. Reducing the number of holds the Library allows can help us better manage these costs, which will allow us to continue providing a broad and diverse selection of e-books and e-audiobooks, and to meet patron demand all year.</p>

<p><b>Is this change being made due to the City’s budget challenges?</b></p>
<p>No, this change is part of routine service assessments and adjustments the Library makes to ensure we are aligning our services with our current budgetary and staffing resources. The Library has been monitoring rising costs of digital books for several years and has been assessing the best course of action to manage these increasing costs. The change to our maximum holds limit for digital books is being made now so that we can continue to maintain reasonable wait times as costs and popularity of these materials continue to rise.</p>
<p><b>That all makes sense. But I use my Libby holds list as my “to be read” wish list. What else can I do? </b></p>
<p>If you tend to place holds on digital books through the Library’s online catalog, we encourage you to check out the <a href="https://help.bibliocommons.com/020shelves/000my-shelves/">“Shelves” feature</a> in the online catalog, which allows you to tag books you want to read in the future. If you use OverDrive’s Libby app to place holds on and borrow digital books, you can use the “Tags” feature to easily create a wish list. Check the <a href="https://help.libbyapp.com/en-us/6087.htm#aanchor38">Libby Help section</a> for more information.</p>
<p><b>Do you have other suggestions for finding great digital books that are available without a wait? </b></p>
<p>Yes! You can check out hundreds of e-books and e-audiobooks right away, with no holds, through OverDrive’s Always Available collection. It includes a wide range of popular e-books and e-audiobooks, and the collection is always changing. Look for the <a href="https://spl.overdrive.com/library/avail">Always Available collection</a> in the e-book catalog or, in Libby, look for the Available Now section.</p>
<p><b>Further reading: </b>If you’re interested in learning more about the topic of digital book pricing and how that affects libraries, you can <a href="https://www.govtech.com/biz/data/behind-e-books-libraries-find-restrictions-and-high-costs">explore further at this GovTech article</a>: “Behind E-Books, Libraries Find Restrictions and High Costs.”</p>

The user would still be able to install apps using a ~/Applications folder and have settings in ~/Library. ~/Library is typically used automatically, while ~/Applications is something that needs to be created, but works just fine.  I use this at work to install some things I would otherwise not be able to install.

An app wasn't launching on their phone, they went to the Apple Store, the person figured out that they hadn't updated their apps in a long time, did that, made sure it worked, and turned on auto-updates (after asking if that would be good for them). Perfect, I didn't even know they had a problem until I heard the story about it being fixed.<p>I've had relatives go to other tech support places and usually it means they pay money for someone to upsell them on something else or tell them they need a new machine. Apple is fine supporting my parents who don't want a new iPhone. Yea, eventually it's out of support, but it's a long enough time.</p><p>I also love that the Apple ecosystem tends towards "you should be willing to pay money for something" rather than "let's see how we can scam money out of someone unwilling to part with their money." If you're techie, you know the difference between real stuff and fake stuff. When non-techies get a pop-up on their Windows laptop telling them that their anti-virus subscription is running out (that came pre-installed) and that they'll be vulnerable to all sorts of bad things if they don't pay $50, they get nervous and call me. Then I have to figure out (over the phone) how to uninstall the crap and get Microsoft Defender working.</p><p>Even Windows 11 is just becoming a pile of ads and other junk.</p><p>With streaming TV boxes, Roku ends up installing apps they don't know how to uninstall because if you press the play button while the TV is off, it installs whatever app they're promoting on the screen saver. Fire TV and Android TV are a mess of ads and it's hard to know what content you have access to and what you don't. I'm just so sick of relatives asking me "How did this app get on my Roku? How do I get it off?" and things like "How do I only see the shows I have access to? Why is it showing me Showtime when it tells me I have to pay when I click on it? I think dad might have subscribed to things because he didn't know what he was doing. How do I cancel that? No I don't know what he might have subscribed to."</p><p>Sure, you can say that Apple TV comes with the Apple TV app pre-installed, but it isn't constantly pushing things on you. Sure, Apple would like an iCloud subscription, but if my parents end up giving Apple $1/mo, I'm fine with that. The level of difference is simply astonishing. It's like having a store email you once "hey, we have new pants" compared to the stores that email you twice a day "HEY!!!! HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT NEW PANTS!!!!" You can say "they're both doing it", but there's a huge difference.</p><p>Apple isn't perfect, but I feel comfortable with non-techie people in my life having Apple products. They can get support when they need it at the Apple Store, Apple is happy with the money they've paid for the product, and I can put their technical needs out of my mind. They love it too. They get unlimited free access to helpful employees who fix their stuff faster than I can get to it. Yea, if you're techie you know how things work and what to look for and you can make decisions for yourself. When relatives buy non-Apple stuff, they're making a decision that I'm going to fix things for them.

Running well on old and cheap hardware is also a plus, I couldn't convince anyone to buy a new or even used iMac (and wouldn't want to do that anyway, macOS is far from bug free...).</p><p>That said, none of them have self-destructive tendencies and I don't expect to just give them a device and have them set it up themselves.

From Fedora 39, I switched to using the built-in remote desktop function (RDP) + an always-on Wireguard connection, which makes screen sharing so smooth when I occasionally need to help with non-OS related challenges. This can also be used for SSH access, or whatever.</p><p>I recently went with Fedora Silverblue for another relative, which makes everything stay up to date without them noticing. So far it has worked fine, but installing the printer driver was a bit different than usual – but not a problem.</p><p>EDIT: Prior experiences has been primarily with macOS, and it has been a lot of trouble adjusting it to their needs and preferences.

My only hope now is that a Jonathan Haidt and Tristan Harris arise from the ashes to protect the elderly without blaming them for software design mistakes arising over the last 3 decades that could have been avoided. Finance paved the way for abuse of the elderly. Sadly, big tech has picked up that torch and run with it.</span></p></div></td></tr>

Here is my experience. I tried with cheaper phones that we can just replace when they lose, drop it, or many other reasons.<p>Get them on iPhones, Macs, Apple TV, and iPads. They can be used ones or hand-me-downs, but that ecosystem works for them. Here is a setup for the in-laws.</p><p>An Apple TV drives as the "Apple Home" Setup while an iPad (the backup) is mounted near the TV. That room/area is the "talking to the kids area" where they just know how to respond or start a video call. The only other button they learned was to switch between their favorite local cable provider and the Apple TV. It did take a lot of repeated practice from "I can see on the iPad but not TV" to "seeing and talking on the big TV".</p><p>iPhones/Macs (instead of selling yours, give them your old one) are the easiest to set up and maintain. The contacts sync, and they have stopped complaining about getting back their phone contacts. The father-in-law once hand-wrote about a 5-paged A4 with about 200+ odd numbers and came to me to sync to the new phone. They are not losing their photos anymore and can spend hours browsing photos of their gigantic family members.</p><p>Tip: Set up your Apple TV screensaver with a specific Album and keep sharing photos there. Now, watch the grandparents, grand-everyone just sit in front of the screensaver and spend hours talking, laughing, arguing, crying, and sleeping off.

So, this used to happen a lot when the kids wanted to play with the grandparents phones. So, I explain nicely to everyone that the devices are out of bounds for everyone and no-one touches the devices any more. That solves that. However, on rare occasions, there are needs to enter the Apple password -- my wife have a few other cousins who helps out. For parents with no access to external help, I suggest printing out on a paper and keeping it safe (use a font-size large of a serif fonts). If your local language is not English, complex password but based off the local language are easier -- (in locale) my dear friend's NAME that died during WWII on this DATE, etc. ;-)<p>Update: For cultural context and to avoid confusion with others around the world who have separate living spaces, my in-laws lives in a pretty large sprawl of almost a colony on their own with their brothers, sisters, cousins, and the entire families. On Google Maps, I had actually named the central home of that locality (my in-laws) to a specific name based on their family name -- making it easy for deliveries by post (Amazon, Post Office, Air Cargo deliveries, etc). In that part of the world, addresses are not precise and still goes on word of mouth.

It was 100% the right move.  I haven't had to fix their computer in the past 7 years.  Bought refurbs to keep the price down but it was still a couple grand total for two units.  I got the cell enabled ones too so they work when they travel.  Totally worth it.<p>A couple years ago I finally got them to switch from their pre-paid flip phone to an iphone.  That's also gone extremely well.  They own a Thor RV which (no surprise) has a terrible OEM stereo.  Replaced that with a carplay capable one with a giant (but pretty low res) screen and that's made their RV travel GPS integration far less buggy than when using plain old bluetooth.</p><p>TBH moving them to iOS from windows was far less of a painful process than I expected and I'm pretty apple positive.  The fact that it just works and they really can't 'f it up makes a big difference.  Now they can download all sorts of shit games and I really don't have to worry about the system getting hosed.  If I considered how much I value my time and the frustration multiplier then it's an investment that has easily paid back in multiples.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://gajus.com/blog/avoiding-visually-ambiguous-characters-in-ids">https://gajus.com/blog/avoiding-visually-ambiguous-characters-in-ids</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40127124">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blog-post-body"><p>It is not uncommon that I need to write down or communicate IDs when interacting with systems, e.g. reporting a bug, entering a discount code, or tracking a package. It is frustrating when the experience is marred by an easy mistake to avoid - visually ambiguous characters.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-visually-ambiguous-characters"></h2>
<ul>
<li><code>O</code> / <code>0</code> - The letter <code>O</code> and the number <code>0</code> can look very similar, especially in fonts where the number zero isn’t slashed or dotted.</li>
<li><code>I</code> / <code>l</code> / <code>1</code> / <code>7</code> - The letter <code>I</code> (uppercase <code>i</code>), lowercase <code>l</code> (<code>L</code>), the number <code>1</code>, and the number <code>7</code> <sup><a id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#user-content-fn-1">1</a></sup> can be indistinguishable in many types of print and handwriting.</li>
<li><code>5</code> / <code>S</code> - In some fonts, the number <code>5</code> and the letter <code>S</code> can appear quite similar.</li>
<li><code>2</code> / <code>Z</code> - These can also be confused with each other, particularly in handwritten forms.</li>
<li><code>8</code> / <code>B</code> - These characters might be mixed up when poorly written or in certain stylized fonts.</li>
<li><code>6</code> / <code>G</code> - These characters can be confused in some fonts.</li>
<li><code>9</code> / <code>q</code> / <code>g</code> - These characters can be confused in some fonts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-are-visually-ambiguous-characters-a-problem"></h2>
<p>They cause confusion and errors in data entry, especially when the characters are handwritten or when the font is not clear. For example, if a user is trying to enter a code that contains the letter 'O' and the number '0', they might not be able to tell which character is which. This leads to frustrating user experiences.</p>
<p>A few examples using different system fonts:</p>
<ul><li><span>9qg6G8B2Z5SIl170O</span> (ariel)</li><li><span>9qg6G8B2Z5SIl170O</span> (helvetica)</li><li><span>9qg6G8B2Z5SIl170O</span> (courier)</li><li><span>9qg6G8B2Z5SIl170O</span> (times)</li><li><span>9qg6G8B2Z5SIl170O</span> (verdana)</li><li><span>9qg6G8B2Z5SIl170O</span> (georgia)</li><li><span>9qg6G8B2Z5SIl170O</span> (tahoma)</li><li><span>9qg6G8B2Z5SIl170O</span> (impact)</li><li><span>9qg6G8B2Z5SIl170O</span> (comic sans)</li></ul>
<p>Some pairs are visually ambiguous in all fonts (e.g. <code>I</code> and <code>l</code>), while others are much harder to distinguish in handwritten forms, e.g. try writing <code>9qg</code> in your own handwriting.</p>
<h2 id="when-it-matters"></h2>
<p>Any time that the ID might need to be communicated verbally or written down, e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer support</li>
<li>Discount codes</li>
<li>Tracking codes</li>
<li>Error IDs</li>
<li>Product IDs</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="deciding-between-case-sensitivity"></h2>
<p>You may also consider whether your IDs should be case-sensitive or not. Is <code>abc</code> the same as <code>ABC</code>?</p>
<p>Assuming that you are going with case sensitivity, you have 53 characters to choose from (adjusted for visually ambiguous characters). On the other hand, if you decide to make your IDs case-insensitive, you have only 22 characters to choose from.</p>
<p>Assuming an ID length of 5 characters, you have the following number of possible IDs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Case-sensitive: 53^5 = 418,195,493</li>
<li>Case-insensitive: 22^5 = 5,153,632</li>
</ul>
<p>However, as the number of members in the set increases, the number of possible IDs increases exponentially.</p>
<ul>
<li>Case-sensitive: 53^8 = 62,259,690,411,360</li>
<li>Case-insensitive: 22^8 = 54,875,873,536</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the real question is whether what's preferable is a shorter ID with a higher chance of visual ambiguity or a longer ID with a lower chance of visual ambiguity.</p>
<h3 id="case-sensitivity-and-third-party-systems"></h3>
<p>As pointed out in a Hacker News comment <sup><a id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#user-content-fn-2">2</a></sup>, if you use both upper and lower case, you are likely to eventually be surprised by some third party system or protocol that is case insensitive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I even found a commercial system which allowed users to choose IDs with case sensitivity (iD and id being distinct) but if you query it for one which does not exist they do case insensitive matching and return the wrong data.</p>
<p>When I reported this bug they said it was for convenience!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="visually-unambiguous-dictionary"></h2>
<p>As my preference is readability, this is the character set that I use for generating IDs in my projects:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="json" data-theme="default"><code data-language="json" data-theme="default"><span data-line=""><span>[</span></span>

<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>"c"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>"d"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>"e"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>"f"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>"h"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>"i"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>"j"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>"k"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>"m"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>"n"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>"o"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>"p"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>"r"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>"s"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>"t"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>"w"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>"x"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>"y"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>"3"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>"4"</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>]</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="further-considerations"></h2>
<h3 id="combinations"></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>rn</code> (looks like <code>m</code>) <sup><a id="user-content-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#user-content-fn-3">3</a></sup></li>
<li><code>vv</code> (looks like <code>w</code>) <sup><a id="user-content-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#user-content-fn-4">4</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I would be wary of excluding characters just because they look like other characters when combined. Avoiding these particular combinations might be a good idea at the ID generation level.</p>
<h3 id="phonetic-similarity"></h3>
<p>In some cases, you might also want to avoid characters that sound similar when spoken. For example, <code>b</code> and <code>p</code> can sound similar when spoken out loud. This can be especially important in situations where IDs are communicated verbally.</p>

<p>This takes the approach of allowing ambiguous characters by decoding them to the same value, and also considers the problem of accidental obscenities.</p>

<p>A character set I like to use when I need something like this is the one used by Open Location Code, which is 23456789CFGHJMPQRVWX.

It does however include both 6 and G, as well as 9 and Q.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Deep learning (DL) is becoming the cornerstone of numerous applications both in datacenters and at the edge. Specialized hardware is often necessary to meet the performance requirements of state-of-the-art DL models, but the rapid pace of change in DL models and the wide variety of systems integrating DL make it impossible to create custom computer chips for all but the largest markets. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) present a unique blend of reprogrammability and direct hardware execution that make them suitable for accelerating DL inference. They offer the ability to customize processing pipelines and memory hierarchies to achieve lower latency and higher energy efficiency compared to general-purpose CPUs and GPUs, at a fraction of the development time and cost of custom chips. Their diverse high-speed IOs also enable directly interfacing the FPGA to the network and/or a variety of external sensors, making them suitable for both datacenter and edge use cases. As DL has become an ever more important workload, FPGA architectures are evolving to enable higher DL performance. In this article, we survey both academic and industrial FPGA architecture enhancements for DL. First, we give a brief introduction on the basics of FPGA architecture and how its components lead to strengths and weaknesses for DL applications. Next, we discuss different styles of DL inference accelerators on FPGA, ranging from model-specific dataflow styles to software-programmable overlay styles. We survey DL-specific enhancements to traditional FPGA building blocks such as logic blocks, arithmetic circuitry, and on-chip memories, as well as new in-fabric DL-specialized blocks for accelerating tensor computations. Finally, we discuss hybrid devices that combine processors and coarse-grained accelerator blocks with FPGA-like interconnect and networks-on-chip, and highlight promising future research directions.

The two publishing houses made up 37 percent and 11 percent of the market share, according to the filing, and combined they would have condensed the Big Five publishing houses into the Big Four. But the government intervened and brought an antitrust case against Penguin to determine whether that would create a monopoly.&nbsp;</p><p><span>The judge ultimately ruled that the merger </span><em>would</em><span> create a monopoly and </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-obtains-permanent-injunction-blocking-penguin-random-house-s-proposed" rel="">blocked the $2.2 billion purchase</a><span>. But during the trial, the head of every major publishing house and literary agency got up on the stand to speak about the publishing industry and give numbers, giving us an eye-opening account of the industry from the inside. All of the transcripts from the trial were compiled into a book called </span><em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/2268/9781948586559" rel="">The Trial</a></em><span>. It took me a year to read, but I’ve finally summarized my findings and pulled out all the compelling highlights.</span></p><p><span>I think I can sum up what I’ve learned like this: The Big Five publishing houses spend most of their money on book advances for big celebrities like Brittany Spears and franchise authors like James Patterson and this is the bulk of their business. They also sell a lot of Bibles, repeat best sellers like </span><em>Lord of the Rings,</em><span> and children’s books like </span><em>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</em><span>. These two market categories (celebrity books and repeat bestsellers from the backlist) make up the entirety of the publishing industry and even fund their vanity project: publishing all the rest of the books we think about when we think about book publishing (which make no money at all and typically sell less than 1,000 copies). </span></p><p>But let’s dig into everything they said in detail. </p><p><span>In my essay “</span><a href="https://www.elysian.press/p/creator-economy-for-fiction-authors" rel="">Writing books isn’t a good idea</a><span>” I wrote that, in 2020, only 268 titles sold more than 100,000 copies, and 96 percent of books sold less than 1,000 copies. That’s still the vibe. </span></p><blockquote><p>Q. Do you know approximately how many authors there are across the industry with 500,000 units or more during this four-year period?</p><p>A. My understanding is that it was about 50. </p><p>Q. 50 authors across the publishing industry who during this four-year period sold more than 500,000 units in a single year?</p><p>A. Yes. </p><p><span>— </span></p><span>, CEO, Penguin Random House US</span></blockquote><p>The DOJ’s lawyer collected data on 58,000 titles published in a year and discovered that 90 percent of them sold fewer than 2,000 copies and 50 percent sold less than a dozen copies. </p><p><span>In my essay “</span><a href="https://www.elysian.press/p/publishing-industry-truth" rel="">No one will read your book</a><span>,” I said that publishing houses work more like venture capitalists. They invest small sums in lots of books in hopes that one of them breaks out and becomes a unicorn, making enough money to fund all the rest. </span></p><p>Turns out, they agree!</p><blockquote><p>Every year, in thousands of ideas and dreams, only a few make it to the top. So I call it the Silicon Valley of media. We are angel investors of our authors and their dreams, their stories. That’s how I call my editors and publishers: angels… It’s rather this idea of Silicon Valley, you see 35 percent are profitable; 50 on a contribution basis. So every book has that same likelihood of succeeding.</p><p>— Markus Dohle, CEO, Penguin Random House</p></blockquote><p>Those unicorns happen every five to 10 years or so. </p><blockquote><p><span>We’re very hit driven. When a book is successful, it can be wildly successful. There are books that sell millions and millions of copies, and those are financial gushes for the publishers of that book, sometimes for years to come… A gusher is once in a decade or something. For instance, I don’t know if you know the </span><em>Twilight</em><span> series of books? Hachette published the </span><em>Twilight</em><span> series of books, and those made hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of time.</span></p><p><span>Right now the novels of Colleen Hoover are topping the bestseller lists in really, really huge numbers and the publishers of those books are making a lot of money. You probably remember </span><em>The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo</em><span>… Or the </span><em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em><span> series. So once every five years, ten years, those come along for the whole industry and become the industry driver that’s drawing people into bookstores because there is such a commotion about them.&nbsp;</span></p><p>— Michael Pietsch, CEO, Hachette</p></blockquote><p>They spent a lot of the trial talking about books that made an advance of more than $250,000—they called these “anticipated top-sellers.” According to Nicholas Hill, a partner at Bates White Economic Consulting, 2 percent of all titles earn an advance over $250,000. </p><p>Publisher’s Marketplace says it’s even lower. </p><blockquote><p>Top-selling authors were defined as those receiving advances (i.e., guaranteed money) in excess of $250,000. Far fewer than 1 percent of authors receive advances over that mark; Publishers Marketplace, which tracks these things, recorded 233 such deals in all of 2022. </p><p><span>— </span></p><span>, </span><a href="https://shush.substack.com/p/a-sorry-end-to-publishings-biggest" rel="">Publisher at Sutherland House</a></blockquote><p>Hill says titles that earn advances over $250,000 account for 70 percent of advance spending by publishing houses. At Penguin Random House, it’s even more. The bulk of their advance spending goes to deals worth $1 million or more, and there are about 200 of those deals a year. Of the roughly $370 million they say PRH accounts for, $200 million of that goes to advance deals worth $1 million or more. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe5fb286-2193-431d-9a1b-1c473eb8ca9a_1288x748.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe5fb286-2193-431d-9a1b-1c473eb8ca9a_1288x748.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe5fb286-2193-431d-9a1b-1c473eb8ca9a_1288x748.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe5fb286-2193-431d-9a1b-1c473eb8ca9a_1288x748.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe5fb286-2193-431d-9a1b-1c473eb8ca9a_1288x748.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe5fb286-2193-431d-9a1b-1c473eb8ca9a_1288x748.png" width="1288" height="748" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/be5fb286-2193-431d-9a1b-1c473eb8ca9a_1288x748.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:748,&quot;width&quot;:1288,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:131766,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe5fb286-2193-431d-9a1b-1c473eb8ca9a_1288x748.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe5fb286-2193-431d-9a1b-1c473eb8ca9a_1288x748.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe5fb286-2193-431d-9a1b-1c473eb8ca9a_1288x748.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe5fb286-2193-431d-9a1b-1c473eb8ca9a_1288x748.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>This chart shows that as advances go up, more of them come from Penguin Random House which has the deepest pockets.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Most of those are deals with celebrities.

We are approaching authors and celebrities and politicians and athletes for ideas. So it’s really we are on the look out. We are scouts in a lot of ways…</p><p>— Jennifer Bergstrom, SVP, Gallery Books Group</p></blockquote><p>Bergstrom said her biggest celebrity sale was Amy Schumer who received millions of dollars for her advance.</p><blockquote><p><span>We’ve had a lot of success publishing musicians, I mentioned Bruce Springsteen. We’ve also published Bob Dylan and Linda Ronstadt, a lot of entertainers through the years…</span><strong> </strong><span>There was a political writer, Ben Shapiro, who has a very popular podcast and a large following. We also competed with HarperCollins for that.</span></p><p>— Jonathan Karp, CEO, Simon &amp; Schuster</p></blockquote><p>Penguin Random House US has guidelines for who gets what advance:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Category 1: Lead titles with a sales goal of 75,000 units and up</strong></p><ul><li><p>Advance: $500,000 and up</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Category 2: Titles with a sales goal of 25,000-75,000 units</strong></p><ul><li><p>Advance: $150,000-$500,000</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Category 3: Titles with a sales goal of 10,000-25,000 units</strong></p><ul><li><p>Advance: $50,000- $150,000</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Category 4: Titles with a sales goal of 5,000 to 10,000 units</strong></p><ul><li><p>Advance: $50,000 or less</p></li></ul></li></ul><p>Is anyone else alarmed that the top tier is book sales of 75,000 units and up? One post on Substack could get more views than that…..</p><p>Franchise authors are the other big category. Walsch says James Patterson and John Grisham get advances in the “many millions.” Putnam makes most of its money from repeat authors like John Sandford, Clive Cussler, Tom Clancy, Lisa Scottoline, and others. </p><blockquote><p>Q. Putnam typically publihses about 60 books a year. Correct?</p><p>A. 60, 65, sort of on naverage… I will say of those 65, though, a good portion of those are repeat authors… franchise authors that we regularly publish every year, sometimes twice a year. </p><p>— Sally Kim, SVP and Publisher, Putnam</p></blockquote><p>The advantage of publishing celebrity books is that they have a built-in audience. </p><blockquote><p>In some of the cases, the reason they are paying big money is because the person has a big platform. And if that platform is there for the advertising, then the spend might be lower.</p><p>— Jennifer Rudolph Walsh, former Agent</p></blockquote><p>Macmillan agrees. </p><blockquote><p>Q. Would you agree that those type of authors, meaning the ones with the built-in audience, are also authors who would command a high advance if they went to a traditional publisher like Macmillan or PRH?&nbsp;</p><p>A. That’s a broad brush. But, yes…</p><p>Q. And you’re willing to pay more if they have a significant following?&nbsp;</p><p>A. Yes.</p><p>— Donald Weisberg, CEO, Macmillan Publishers</p></blockquote><p>They give some examples:</p><blockquote><p><em>The Butcher and the Wren</em><span>… this particular author has a big following, and with a single post on Instagram, she presold over 40,000 books. So, I mean, that’s just staggering from a per copy perspective, and it pretty much guarantees a number one spot on the New York [Times] best seller list when it’s published in September.</span></p><p>— Jennifer Rudolph Walsh, former Agent</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>These big advances, the authors have quite a bit of their own infrastructure with them. They have their own publicists. They have their own social media people. They have their own newsletters. So they actually are able—we are able to offload a good amount of the work, not all the time, but that is actually a factor in why we sometimes pay these big advances, because the authors are actually capable of helping us a lot.</p><p>— Jonathan Karp, CEO, Simon &amp; Schuster</p></blockquote><p>For example:</p><blockquote><p><span>Q. Who is the best selling Simon &amp; Schuster author currently?&nbsp;</span><br><span>A. Right now it’s Colleen Hoover.&nbsp;</span><br><span>Q. Does she have the highest marketing budget that Simon &amp; Schuster pays?&nbsp;</span><br><span>A. No.&nbsp;</span><br><span>Q. Why is that?&nbsp;</span><br><span>A. She’s the queen of TikTok, and so she has a huge following on TikTok.</span></p><p>— Jonathan Karp, CEO, Simon &amp; Schuster</p></blockquote><p>Related:</p><blockquote><p>[One author wrote] paranormal, so it’s sexy vampires. This book was probably her 21st book. So she’s what I would call a franchise author. She’s very established. Though we spent $1.2 million on the book, we spent about $62,000 on the marketing and publicity because she had such an established fan base… </p><p>[Another author is] a celebrity-adjacent author, but also her platform was on social media. So we paid $450,000 for her book, and we spent $36,000 on the marketing and publicity. We didn’t need to spend more than that because she already booked at that point on Good Morning America, The Today Show. So publicity drove that, and that didn’t cost us. </p><p>— Jennifer Bergstrom, SVP, Gallery Books Group</p></blockquote><p>Just goes to show that the main thing an author gets from a publishing house is an advance!</p><blockquote><p>Every second book in America, ballpark, is being sold via e-commerce…Amazon.com has 50 million books available. A bookstore, a good independent bookstore, has around 50,000 different books available… an algorithm decides what is being presented and made visible and discoverable for an end consumer online. It makes a huge difference.</p><p>— Markus Dohle, CEO, Penguin Random House</p></blockquote><p>Publishing houses try to game the algorithm and even pay to get ahead of it. </p><blockquote><p>Q.&nbsp; Penguin Random House has hired data scientists to try and figure out these algorithms so that its books get better presented on Amazon than its competitors’ books?&nbsp;</p><p>A. One of the many efforts that we pursue, correct.</p><p>Q. And Penguin Random House pays Amazon to improve its search results?&nbsp;</p><p>A. There is something that is available to our publishers, it’s called Amazon Marketing Services, AMS, and all publishers can spend money and give it to Amazon to have hopefully better search results.</p><p>— Markus Dohle, CEO, Penguin Random House</p></blockquote><p><span>, president of Ayesha Pande Literary, says that 20 percent of her authors earn out their advance—if she’s being generous.</span></p><blockquote><p>The single most important contract term is the advance…Because in a large number of cases, it may be the only compensation that the author will receive for their work.</p><p>— Ayesha Pande, President, Ayesha Pande Literary</p></blockquote><p>Even celebrity books flop. </p><blockquote><p>There are plenty of books that we spend $1 million on the advance and published them last year and they did not even make the top 1,000 on BookScan… Less than 45 percent of those books [that we spend a million dollars on] end up on that thousand best seller list.</p><p>— Madeline Mcintosh, CEO, Penguin Random House US</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Just because the publisher pays $250,000 or $500,000 or $1 million for a book does not guarantee that a single person is going to buy it. A lot of what we do is unknowable and based on inspiration and optimism.”</p><p>— Michael Pietsch, CEO, Hachette</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Even celebrities, though sometimes you think it’s going to be a big best seller, it flops. It happens… &nbsp;I mean, Andrew Cuomo’s book was sold at the height of his being America’s governor during the COVID crisis. I mean, that book was sold for $5 million, I believe. I don’t know for a fact. But by the time it came out, the nursing home scandal had happened, the Me Too issues, and the book didn’t do any business. </p><p>Sometimes it’s just a timing issue, like Marie Kondo.

It happens. It happens more than any of us would like. </p><p>— Gail Ross, Literary Agent</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>If I look at the top 10 percent of books… that 10 percent level gets you to about 300,000 copies sold in that year. And if you told me I’m definitely going to sell 300,000 copies in a year, I would spend many millions of dollars to get that book.</p><p>— Madeline Mcintosh, CEO, Penguin Random House US</p></blockquote><p>Publishing houses pay millions of dollars for a book that sells only 300,000 copies??? Well, because books don’t sell a lot of copies, they don’t make a lot of money. According to Hill, 85 percent of the books with advances of $250,000 and up never earn out their advance.

That goes for the rest of them too:</p><blockquote><p>It would be just a couple of books in every hundred are driving that degree of profit… twoish books account for the lion’s share of profitability. </p><p>— Madeline Mcintosh, CEO, Penguin Random House US</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Around half the books we publish make a profit of some kind.</p><p>— Michael Pietsch, CEO, Hachette</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>About half of the books we publish make money, and a much lower percentage of them earn back the advance we pay.</p><p>— Jonathan Karp, CEO, Simon &amp; Schuster</p></blockquote><p>Many publishers have realized that maybe those big advances aren’t worth it. </p><blockquote><p>We have a report that we colloquially call ‘The Ones That Got Away.’ And it’s a report on the books where we bid $500,000 or more as an advance and did not succeed in acquiring the book… this report stands as a kind of caution against the high risk of big advances because the lesson we take away again and again is: Thank goodness we stopped bidding when we did because even at the advance we offered, we would have lost money… Very frequently, the winning bid in our calculation is a money loser.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>— Michael Pietsch, CEO, Hachette</p></blockquote><p>If new books typically don’t sell well, well that’s why publishing houses make their revenue from their backlist. </p><blockquote><p>I would actually expect a book that is selling 300,000 units in a year is probably going to sell at least 400,000 or 500,000 over its life once you get backlist in there too.</p><p>Our backlist brings in about a third of our annual revenues, so $300 million a year roughly, a little less.</p><p>— Michael Pietsch, CEO, Hachette</p></blockquote><p><span>The backlist includes all of the books that have ever come out. Brian Murray, CEO of HarperCollins, points out that their backlist includes bibles (an $80 million business), coloring books, dictionaries, encyclopedias, magic trick books, calendars, puzzles, and SAT study guides. It also includes perennial bestsellers like </span><em>Don Quijote</em><span>, Steven King’s </span><em>Carrie, </em><span>and Tolkien’s </span><em>Lord of the Rings</em><span>—these books continue to sell year after year. </span></p><p>Popular children’s books are cash cows selling huge amounts of copies year after year and generation after generation.</p><blockquote><p>Sometimes children’s books will be three generations, people have been buying them over and over again, and so that backlist catalog is really, really important to pay for the overhead of your publishing teams and then also to take the risks on the new books. So without a backlist I think it’s very hard to compete with these big books.</p><p>— Brian Murray, CEO, HarperCollins</p></blockquote><p><span>For instance, Penguin Random House owns Eric Carle’s </span><em>Very Hungry Caterpillar</em><span> intellectual property. The book has been on Publisher Weekly’s bestseller list </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2021/05/27/the-very-hungry-caterpillar-tops-amazon-bestseller-list-after-eric-carles-death---but-its-been-a-consistent-hit-for-decades/?sh=22dc74312260" rel="">every week for 19 years</a><span>. </span></p><blockquote><p>Children’s books comprised 27 percent of PRH’s sales in 2021. That’s about $725 million—so roughly double the size of Scholastic’s trade division, and more or less equal on its own to all of Macmillan or HBG. Christian books accounted for 2 percent.</p><p><span>—</span><em>The Trial</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Backlist titles like The Bible and </span><em>Very Hungry Caterpillar</em><span> and </span><em>Lord of the Rings</em><span> make up a disproportionately large percentage of the publishing industry. </span></p><blockquote><p>Q. Are you concerned that Amazon will favor Penguin Random House Simon &amp; Schuster in terms of promotion and distribution and discoverability?&nbsp;</p><p>A. Yes.</p><p>— Donald Weisberg, CEO, Macmillan Publishers</p></blockquote><p>With Amazon’s data, they could immediately beat out all the publishing houses if they wanted to. </p><blockquote><p><span>I think Amazon as a publisher of books is underestimated. They have about 50 editors… Obviously, given the number of people searching on Amazon for products, that gives them a huge advantage because when people go onto Amazon, they—if the book isn’t there for what they are searching for, they could create that book. That’s one theory I have. But even if that doesn’t happen, they know what people are buying and they have access to that data. Their bestseller list, in my view, is more important than </span><em>The New York Times</em><span> best seller list because it’s in realtime. It’s hourly. And I look at that Amazon best seller list regularly, every day.</span></p><p>— Jonathan Karp, CEO, Simon &amp; Schuster</p></blockquote><p>Wouldn’t it be great if you could pay $9.99 a month and read all of the books you want? Just like you get all the movies you want from Netflix? Or all the music you want from Spotify?</p><p>Technically, it does exist. Kindle Unlimited is the largest, followed by Scribd. Audible isn’t quite all-access, but then Spotify got into audiobooks and made them so. But none of these players have quite taken off the way Netflix or Spotify has.&nbsp;That’s for one reason: The Big Five publishing houses refuse to let their authors participate.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Q. No books are found on Kindle Unlimited? Because you think that’ll be had for the industry?”</p><p>A. We think it’s going to destroy the publishing industry.</p><p>— Markus Dohle, CEO, Penguin Publishing House</p></blockquote><p>He’s right. No one would purchase a book again. </p><blockquote><p>We all know about Netflix, we all know about Spotify and other media categories, and we also know what it has done to some industries… The music industry has lost, in the digital transformation, approximately 50 percent of its overall revenue pool.</p><p>— Markus Dohle, CEO, Penguin Publishing House</p></blockquote><p>There’s one reason. </p><blockquote><p>Around 20 to 25 percent of the readers, the heavy readers, account for 80 percent of the revenue pool of the industry of what consumers spend on books. It’s the really dedicated readers. If they got all-access, the revenue pool of the industry is going to be very small. Physical retail will be gone—see music—within two to three years. And we will be dependent on a few Silicon Valley or Swedish internet companies that will actually provide all-access.</p><p>— Markus Dohle, CEO, Penguin Publishing House</p></blockquote><p>The publishing industry would die, that’s for sure. But I’d be willing to bet writers would get their books read way more. </p><p>And I think it’s on its way. Spotify has already started publishing audiobooks, and my money is on Substack for eventually publishing written books!</p><p>If publishing houses make minimal investment in marketing their authors and focus largely on celebrity books and their backlist, authors who can’t snag a large advance might have better luck building their own audience and publishing elsewhere. </p><blockquote><p>I think really from the advent of online—really, once the internet became popular, you know, we heard the phrase disintermediation. And I don’t understand why that wouldn’t be a possible prospect for any best selling author, to just disintermediate, to go straight to the internet and sell directly if you have a following… Colleen Hoover has published with both Amazon and Simon &amp; Schuster. And her Amazon book was on the independent book sellers’ best seller list. So what that says to me is that a Rubicon has been crossed.</p><p>— Jonathan Karp, CEO, Simon &amp; Schuster</p></blockquote><p>The romance category has already gone independent. </p><blockquote><p>Many of those heavy readers of romance novels at that time switched to self-published stories. A very different price point. 99 cents, $1.99, away from what we call mass-market trade paperbacks… The mass-market trade paperback is the sort of small-format mass-market book, like it is a trade paperback, but a smaller format. It has been declining for the last 25 years. But we had a step change around ’14, ‘15, with this trend that so many consumers went away from mass-market books into electronic ebooks in particular and self-published books.”</p><p>— Markus Dohle, CEO, Penguin Random House</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><span>Gallery author </span></p><span> moved to self-publishing (though Todd began her career writing on Wattpad, and recently returned to set up an imprint at Wattpad Books).</span><p>— Jennifer Bergstrom, SVP, Gallery Books Group</p></blockquote><p>And of course, we have to talk about Kickstarter MVP Brandon Sanderson.</p><blockquote><p><span>There is a </span><em>New York Times</em><span> best selling author in the science fiction and fantasy category. His name is Brandon Sanderson. I believe he’s published by both Macmillan and Penguin Random House. He went onto Kickstarter and announced that he would be offering four of his novels to anybody who wanted them if they wanted to donate to Kickstarter. And he raised over $42 million…</span></p><p><span>I have subsequently become aware of </span><em>Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls</em><span>, which is a series of books. It’s now actually become a whole company. And these are stories to give young girls confidence. And it’s been very successful, and it’s actually resulted in an entire company.</span></p><p>— Jonathan Karp, CEO, Simon &amp; Schuster</p></blockquote><p>After the Judge denied the merger, Penguin went through a massive round of layoffs and Simon &amp; Schuster was sold to a private equity company instead.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Private equity tends to have one game plan: buy a company, load it with debt, wring out costs to improve its financials, sell at a profit. Dealing Simon &amp; Schuster to private equity, The New Republic warned at the time with some slight hyperbole of its own, would mean “absolute devastation and wholesale job loss.”</p><p><span>— </span></p></blockquote><p><span>The publishing houses may live to see another day, but I don’t think their model is long for this world. Unless you are a celebrity or franchise author, the publishing model won’t provide a whole lot more than a tiny advance and a dozen readers. If you </span><em>are</em><span> a celebrity, you’ll still have a much bigger reach on Instagram than you will with your book!</span></p><p>Personally, I could not be more grateful to skip the publishing houses altogether and write directly for my readers here, being supported by those who read this newsletter rather than by a publishing advance that won’t ultimately translate to people reading my work.</p><p>But I’d love to know your thoughts 👇🏻</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.elysian.press/p/no-one-buys-books/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.elysian.press/p/no-one-buys-books/comments" rel=""><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p>Thank you for reading and being here,</p><p><em>P.S.

<p>For the first time since <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/sunspot/2023/12/12/engineers-working-to-resolve-issue-with-voyager-1-computer/">November</a>, NASA’s Voyager 1 spacecraft is returning usable data about the health and status of its onboard engineering systems. The next step is to enable the spacecraft to begin returning science data again. The probe and its twin, Voyager 2, are the only spacecraft to ever fly in interstellar space (the space between stars).</p>
<p>Voyager 1 stopped sending readable science and engineering data back to Earth on Nov. 14, 2023, even though mission controllers could tell the spacecraft was still receiving their commands and otherwise operating normally. In March, the Voyager engineering team at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California confirmed that the issue was tied to one of the spacecraft’s three onboard computers, called the flight data subsystem (FDS). The FDS is responsible for packaging the science and engineering data before it’s sent to Earth.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/voyager/2024/04/04/engineers-pinpoint-cause-of-voyager-1-issue-are-working-on-solution/">team discovered</a> that a single chip responsible for storing a portion of the FDS memory — including some of the FDS computer’s software code — isn’t working. The loss of that code rendered the science and engineering data unusable. Unable to repair the chip, the team decided to place the affected code elsewhere in the FDS memory. But no single location is large enough to hold the section of code in its entirety.</p>
<p>So they devised a plan to divide the affected code into sections and store those sections in different places in the FDS. To make this plan work, they also needed to adjust those code sections to ensure, for example, that they all still function as a whole. Any references to the location of that code in other parts of the FDS memory needed to be updated as well.</p>
<p>The team started by singling out the code responsible for packaging the spacecraft’s engineering data. They sent it to its new location in the FDS memory on April 18. A radio signal takes about 22 ½ hours to reach Voyager 1, which is over 15 billion miles (24 billion kilometers) from Earth, and another 22 ½ hours for a signal to come back to Earth. When the mission flight team heard back from the spacecraft on April 20, they saw that the modification worked: For the first time in five months, they have been able to check the health and status of the spacecraft.</p>
<p>During the coming weeks, the team will relocate and adjust the other affected portions of the FDS software. These include the portions that will start returning science data.</p>
<p>Voyager 2 continues to operate normally. Launched <a href="https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/">over 46 years ago</a>, the twin Voyager spacecraft are the longest-running and most distant spacecraft in history. Before the start of their interstellar exploration, both probes flew by Saturn and Jupiter, and Voyager 2 flew by Uranus and Neptune.</p>

The incident also underlines how difficult it is for foreign companies to verify their outsourced work is not potentially breaking sanctions and ending up on computers in Pyongyang.</p>
<p><strong>A Month of Animation</strong></p>
<p>The story begins in late 2023 with the discovery of a cloud storage server on a North Korean Internet Protocol (IP) address. The server, which appears no longer in use, had been incorrectly configured, making the daily flow of files into and out of this server viewable by anyone without a password.</p>
<p>North Korea employs such servers because the average IT worker inside the country does not have direct access to the Internet. Typically, an organization might have just one or two computers with Internet access; workers need approval to use them and are monitored while they do so.</p>
<p>The cloud server in question was discovered by Nick Roy, who runs the <a href="https://nkinternet.wordpress.com/author/nkinternet/">NK Internet blog</a>. Together, throughout January this year, we observed files. Each day, a new batch of files would appear that included instructions for animation work and the results of that day’s work.</p>
<p>The identity of the person or persons uploading the files could not be determined.</p>
<p>Often the files contained editing comments and instructions in Chinese, presumably written by the production company, along with a translation of those instructions into Korean. This suggests a go-between was responsible for relaying information between the production companies and the animators.</p>
<p>For example, in the communication below, the animator is being asked to improve the shape of the character’s head.</p>

<p>The identity of the North Korean partner was never revealed in any of the documentation observed, but it is likely the April 26 Animation Studio, also known as SEK Studio. The Pyongyang-based organization is North Korea’s premier animation house, producing series for domestic television broadcasts, including the popular “Squirrel and Hedgehog” series.</p>
<p>It has previously worked on several international projects, including <a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/korea/nkorea_cartoon-20061206.html">some with South Korean companies</a> during the “Sunshine Policy” era in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>However, in 2016, the studio was sanctioned by the US Department of Treasury as a North Korean state-owned enterprise. The US government has twice laid additional sanctions on Chinese companies that have worked with the studio or acted as a go-between, <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0526">once in 2021</a> and <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1155">again in 2022</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Accessing the Server</strong></p>
<p>Together with researchers from Mandiant, a computer security company owned by Google, access logs for the server were also examined.</p>
<p>They revealed several logins from Internet addresses associated with virtual private network (VPN) services, but among those that were not VPN-related was an IP address in Spain and three in China. Two of the Chinese addresses were registered to Liaoning Province, which neighbors North Korea and includes the towns of Dandong, Dalian and Shenyang.</p>
<p>All three cities are known to have many North Korean-operated businesses and are main centers for North Korea’s IT workers who live overseas.</p>
<p><strong>Projects Identified</strong></p>
<p>The files related to a range of projects, suggesting several animators were likely involved in the work.</p>
<p>Over the month we observed this traffic, the apparent identity of some of the projects became clear. They included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Season 3 of “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/INVINCIBLE-SEASON-1/dp/B08WJMRHYZ">Invincible</a>,” an Amazon Original animated series produced by California-based Skybound Entertainment. A document on the server carried the name of the series and “Viltruminte Pants LLC,” which appears to be part of the Skybound group.</li>
<li>“<a href="https://youneekstudios.com/iyanu/">Iyanu, Child of Wonder</a>,” an anime about a superhero created by Maryland-based YouNeek Studios and being produced and animated by Lion Forge Entertainment for airing in 2024 on HBO Max.</li>
<li>“<a href="https://dahliya-anime.com/">Dahliya In Bloom</a>” (魔導具師ダリヤはうつむかない), a Japanese anime series scheduled to air from July 2024.</li>
<li>Files named “猫” (Cat) that also carry the name of <a href="https://ekachi-epilka.jp/">Ekachi Epilka</a>, an animation studio in Hokkaido, Japan (<strong>Figure 1</strong>).</li>
<li>Video files that appear to be from “<a href="https://www.octonauts.com/">Octonauts</a>,” a BBC children’s cartoon. The files had no additional identifying information and appeared to be completed, so it is possible these were not worked on by the animators.</li>
<li>An unidentified animation series with documents that refer to Dalian’s <a href="https://weibo.com/u/6819133609">Shepherd Boy Animation</a> (大连牧童动漫).</li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_30092" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-30092"><a href="https://www.38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Figure-3_Williams_NK-Server.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Figure-3_Williams_NK-Server.jpg" alt="" width="1428" height="1010" srcset="https://www.38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Figure-3_Williams_NK-Server.jpg 1428w, https://www.38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Figure-3_Williams_NK-Server-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Figure-3_Williams_NK-Server-1024x724.jpg 1024w, https://www.38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Figure-3_Williams_NK-Server-768x543.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1428px) 100vw, 1428px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-30092">Figure 3. A screenshot of a production frame for “Invincible.”</figcaption></figure>
<p>There is no evidence to suggest that the companies identified in the images had any knowledge that a part of their project had been subcontracted to North Korean animators. In fact, as the editing comments on all the files, including those related to US-based animations, were written in Chinese, it is likely that the contracting arrangement was several steps downstream from the major producers.</p>
<p>There were also several animation files that were never identified, files with video special effects editing instructions for what appeared to be a Chinese movie about basketball, and multiple Russian-language video files and PDFs related to the upkeep and care of horses.</p>
<p>The fact that the server was largely used to store files related to animation suggests that additional relay servers probably exist for North Korean organizations doing other work, such as software development.</p>
<figure id="attachment_30091" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-30091"><a href="https://www.38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Figure-4_Williams_NK-Server.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Figure-4_Williams_NK-Server.jpg" alt="" width="1430" height="805" srcset="https://www.38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Figure-4_Williams_NK-Server.jpg 1430w, https://www.38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Figure-4_Williams_NK-Server-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Figure-4_Williams_NK-Server-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Figure-4_Williams_NK-Server-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1430px) 100vw, 1430px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-30091">Figure 4.

<p><strong>Implications: Due Diligence Needed on IT Outsourcing </strong></p>
<p>In mid-2022, the US government <a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov/media/923126/download?inline">warned companies</a> about the possibility of inadvertently hiring North Korean IT workers, including animators, when looking for remote contractors. <a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov/media/923131/download?inline">An advisory</a> warned that doing so could put the companies at risk of a breach of US and United Nations sanctions.</p>
<p>It noted North Korean workers frequently “misrepresent themselves as foreign (non-North Korean) or US-based teleworkers” and might use VPNs or other methods to make it appear as if they are from and residing in another country.</p>
<p>In response, it recommended that companies institute a number of safeguards such as better verification of work documents, video interviews, background checks and fingerprint login to ensure the workers hired are identified and remain the ones carrying out the work on the project.</p>
<p>Such checks are designed to ensure that the worker you hire is the one who does the work and not just a proxy for someone else.</p>
<p>Last year, US law enforcement agencies <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-court-authorized-action-disrupt-illicit-revenue-generation">disclosed</a> a case in which North Korean workers had paid someone in the US <a href="https://www.northkoreatech.org/2023/10/24/north-korean-programmers-used-a-hosted-laptop-to-freelance-online-says-fbi/">$400 per month</a> to host four laptops on their Internet connection. The workers would access the laptops through remote desktop software and then get on to the American Internet. Analysis of the IP address would make it appear to be coming from a conventional US domestic service provider.</p>
<p>The case caused the US to <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2023/PSA231018">update its guidance</a> for spotting North Korean IT workers.</p>
<p>However, the ability of the North Korean studio to apparently continue working on international projects highlights the difficulty in enforcing current US sanctions in such a global industry. It also highlights the need for US animation companies to be much better informed about all the companies that are involved in their projects.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you're writing C++, there's a good reason (maybe...) as to why you are. And probably, that reason is performance. So often when reading about the language you'll find all sorts of "<em>performance tips and tricks</em>" or "<em>do this instead because it's more efficient</em>". Sometimes you get a good explanation as to why you should. But more often than not, <strong>you won't find any hard numbers to back up that claim</strong>.</p>

<p>I recently found a peculiar one, the <code>final</code> keyword. I'm a little ashamed I haven't learned about this one earlier. <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/the-performance-benefits-of-final-classes/">Multiple blog posts</a> <a href="https://blog.feabhas.com/2022/11/using-final-in-c-to-improve-performance/">claim that it can</a> <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/c-performance-improvement-through-final-devirtualization-258e7ae1d2b5">improve performance</a><sup>(sorry for linking a Medium article)</sup>. It almost seems like it's almost free, and for a very measly change. After reading you'll notice something interesting: no one posted any metrics. Zero. Nada. Zilch. It essentially is <em>"just trust me bro."</em> Claims of performance improvements aren't worth salt unless you have the numbers to back it up. You also need to be able to reproduce the results. I've been guilty of this in the past (<a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/33101">see a PR for Godot I made</a>).</p>

<p>Being a good little engineer with a high performance C++ pet project, I really wanted to validate this claim.</p>

<hr>
<p>I keep on finding myself unable to get away from my pandemic era distraction, <a href="https://github.com/define-private-public/PSRayTracing">PSRayTracing</a>. But I think this is actually a VERY good candidate for testing <code>final</code>. It has many derived classes (implementing interfaces) and they are called millions of times in normal execution.</p>

<p>Side note: when publishing this (April 22nd, 2024), <a href="https://github.com/github/markup/issues/1798">GitHub's rendering of reStructuredText is broken</a>. So if you want to look at the README, please use the <a href="https://gitlab.com/define-private-public/PSRayTracing/-/blob/master/README.rst?ref_type=heads">GitLab mirror of this project</a>.</p>

<p>For the (many) of you who haven't been following this project, the quick and skinny on PSRayTracing: it's a ray tracer implemented in C++, derived from <a href="https://raytracing.github.io/">Peter Shirley's ray tracing minibooks</a>. It serves mainly an academic purpose, but is modeled after my professional experiences writing C++. The goal is to show readers how you can (re)write C++ to be more performant, clean, and well structured. It has additions and improvements from Dr. Shirley's original code. One of the big features I have in it is the ability to toggle on and off changes from the book (via CMake), as well as being able to supply other options like random seeds, multi-core rendering. It is somewhere 4-5x faster than the original book code (single threaded).</p>



<h3>How This Was Done</h3>

<p>Leveraging the build system, I added an extra option to the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>:</p>


<p>Then in C++ we can use (ab)use the pre processor to make a <code>FINAL</code> macro:</p>


<p>And easily it can slapped onto any classes of interest:</p>


<p>Now, we can turn on &amp; off the usage of <code>final</code> in our code base. Yes, it is very hacky and I am disgusted by this myself. <strong>I would never do this in an actual product</strong>, but it provides us a really nice way to apply the <code>final</code> keyword to the code and turn it on and off as we need it for the experiment.</p>

<p><code>final</code> was placed on just about <a href="https://github.com/define-private-public/PSRayTracing/tree/b213aa1338744931977263e61cc6fd4cee6a7f32/render_library/Interfaces">every interface</a>. In the architecture we have things such as <a href="https://github.com/define-private-public/PSRayTracing/tree/b213aa1338744931977263e61cc6fd4cee6a7f32/render_library/Objects"><code>IHittable</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/define-private-public/PSRayTracing/tree/b213aa1338744931977263e61cc6fd4cee6a7f32/render_library/Materials"><code>IMaterial</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/define-private-public/PSRayTracing/tree/b213aa1338744931977263e61cc6fd4cee6a7f32/render_library/Textures"><code>ITexture</code></a>, etc. Take a look at the final scene from book two, we've got quite a few 10K+ virtual objects in this scenario:</p>

<p><a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/sixteenbpp/blog/images/the-performance-impact-of-cpps-final-keyword/book2_final_scene.png"><img alt="Book 2's final scene" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sixteenbpp/blog/images/the-performance-impact-of-cpps-final-keyword/book2_final_scene.png"></a></p>



<p>And alternatively, there are some scenes that don't have many (maybe 10):</p>

<p><a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/sixteenbpp/blog/images/the-performance-impact-of-cpps-final-keyword/perlin_noise_with_lights_scene.png"><img alt="Perlin noise with lights scene" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sixteenbpp/blog/images/the-performance-impact-of-cpps-final-keyword/perlin_noise_with_lights_scene.png"></a></p>



<h3>Initial Concerns:</h3>

<p>For PSRT, when testing something that can boost the performance, I first reach for the default scene <code>book2::final</code>. After applying <code>final</code> enabled the console reported:</p>

<pre>$ ./PSRayTracing -n 100 -j 2
Scene: book2::final_scene
...
Render took 58.587 seconds
</pre>



<p>But then reverting the change:</p>

<pre>$ ./PSRayTracing -n 100 -j 2
Scene: book2::final_scene
...
Render took 57.53 seconds
</pre>



<p>I was a tad bit perplexed? <em>Final was slower?!</em> After a few more runs, I saw a very minimal performance hit. Those blog posts must have lied to me...</p>

<p>Before just tossing this away, I thought it would be best to pull out the verification test script. In a previous revision this was made to essentially fuzz test PSRayTracing (<a href="https://16bpp.net/blog/post/automated-testing-of-a-ray-tracer/">see previous post here</a>). The repo already contains a small set of well known test cases. That suite initially ran for about 20 minutes. But this is where it got a little interesting. The script reported using <code>final</code> slightly faster; wtih <code>final</code> it took 11m 29s. Without <code>final</code> it was 11m 44s. That's +2%. Actually significant.</p>

<p>Something seemed up; more investigation was required.</p>



<h3>Big Beefy Testing</h3>

<p>Unsatisfied with the above, I created a "large test suite" to be more intensive. On my dev machine it needed to run for 8 hours. This was done by bumping up some of the test parameters. Here are the details on what's been tweaked:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Number of Times to Test a Scene: <code>10</code>&nbsp;→ <code>30</code></li>
	<li>Image Size: <code>[320x240, 400x400, 852x480]</code>&nbsp;→ <code>[720x1280, 720x720, 1280x720]</code></li>
	<li>Ray Depth: <code>[10, 25, 50]</code>&nbsp;→ <code>[20, 35, 50]</code></li>
	<li>Samples Per Pixel: <code>[5, 10, 25]</code>&nbsp;→ <code>[25, 50, 75]</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Some test cases now would render in 10 seconds, others would take up to 10 minutes to complete. I thought this was much more comprehensive. The smaller suite did around 350+ test cases in 20+ minutes. This now would do 1150+ over the course of 8+ hours.</p>

<p>The performance of a C++ program is also very compiler (and system) dependent as well. So to be more thorough, this was tested across three machines, three operating systems, and with three different compilers; once with <code>final</code>, and once without it enabled. After doing the math, the machines were chugging along for a cumulative 125+ hours. 🫠</p>

<p>Please look at the tables below for specifics, but the configurations were:</p>

<ul>
	<li>AMD Ryzen 9:
	<ul>
		<li>Linux: GCC &amp; Clang</li>
		<li>Windows: GCC &amp; MSVC</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Apple M1 Mac: GCC &amp; Clang</li>
	<li>Intel i7: Linux GCC</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, one configuration is "AMD Ryzen 9 with Ubuntu Linux using GCC" and another would be "Apple M1 Mac with macOS using Clang". Not all versions of the compilers were all the same; some were harder to get than others. And I do need to note at the time of writing this (and after gathering the data) a new version of Clang was released. Here, is the general summary of the test results:</p>

<p><a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/sixteenbpp/blog/images/the-performance-impact-of-cpps-final-keyword/test_suite_summary_results.png"><img alt="Overall Performance" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sixteenbpp/blog/images/the-performance-impact-of-cpps-final-keyword/test_suite_summary_results.png"></a></p>



<p>This gives off some interesting findings, but tells us one thing right now: <strong>across the board, <code>final</code> isn't always faster; it's in fact slower in some situations</strong>. Sometimes there is a nice speedup (&gt;1%), other times it is detrimental.</p>

<p>While it may be fun to compare compiler vs. compiler for this application (e.g. "Monday Night Compiler Smackdown"), I do not believe it is a fair thing to do with this data; it's only fair to compare "with <code>final</code>" and "without <code>final</code>" To compare compilers (and on different systems) a more comprehensive testing system is required. But there are some interesting observations:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Clang on x86_64 is slow.</li>
	<li>Windows is less performant; Microsoft's own compiler is even lagging.</li>
	<li>Apple's silicon chips are absolute powerhouses.</li>
</ul>

<p>But each scene is different, and contains a different amount of objects that are marked with <code>final</code>. It would be interesting to see percentage wise, how many test cases ran faster or slower with <code>final</code>. Tabling that data, we get this:</p>

<p><a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/sixteenbpp/blog/images/the-performance-impact-of-cpps-final-keyword/percent_of_tests_which_are_faster.png"><img alt="Percent of test cases that are faster with final turned on" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sixteenbpp/blog/images/the-performance-impact-of-cpps-final-keyword/percent_of_tests_which_are_faster.png"></a></p>



<p>That 1% perf boost for some C++ applications is very desirable (e.g. HFT). And if we're hitting it for 50%+ of our test cases it seems like using <code>final</code> is something that we should consider. But on the flip side, we also need to see how the inverse looks. How much slower was it? And for how many test cases?</p>

<p><a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/sixteenbpp/blog/images/the-performance-impact-of-cpps-final-keyword/percent_of_tests_which_are_slower.png"><img alt="Percent of test cases that are slower with final turned on" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sixteenbpp/blog/images/the-performance-impact-of-cpps-final-keyword/percent_of_tests_which_are_slower.png"></a></p>



<p>Clang on x86_64 Linux right there is an absolute "<em>yikes</em>". More than 90% of test cases ran at least 5% slower with <code>final</code> turned on!! Remember how I said a 1% increase is good for some applications? A 1% hit is also bad. Windows with MSVC isn't faring too well either.</p>

<p>As stated way above, this is very scene dependent. Some have only a handful of virtual objects. Others have warehouses full of them. Taking a look (on average) how much faster/slower a scene is with <code>final</code> turned on:</p>

<p><a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/sixteenbpp/blog/images/the-performance-impact-of-cpps-final-keyword/average_performance_change_per_scene.png"><img alt="How much faster or slower was each scene on average is final was used" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/sixteenbpp/blog/images/the-performance-impact-of-cpps-final-keyword/average_performance_change_per_scene.png"></a></p>

<p>I don't know Pandas that well. I was having some issues creating a Multi-Index table (from arrays) and having the table be both styled and formatted nicely. So instead each column has a configuration number appended to the end of its name. Here is what each number means:</p>

<ul>
	<li>0 - GCC 13.2.0 AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX Ubuntu 23.10</li>
	<li>1 - Clang 17.0.2 AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX Ubuntu 23.10</li>
	<li>2 - MSVC 17 AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX Windows 11 Home (22631.3085)</li>
	<li>3 - GCC 13.2.0 (w64devkit) AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX Windows 11 Home (22631.3085)</li>
	<li>4 - Clang 15 M1 macOS 14.3 (23D56)</li>
	<li>5 - GCC 13.2.0 (homebrew) M1 macOS 14.3 (23D56)</li>
	<li>6 - GCC 12.3.0 i7-10750H Ubuntu 22.04.3</li>
</ul>



<p>So this is where things are really eye popping. On some configurations and specific scenes might have a 10% perf boost. For example <code>book1::final_scene</code> with GCC on AMD &amp; Linux. But other scenes (on the same configuration) have a minimal 0.5% increase such as <code>fun::three_spheres</code>.</p>

<p>But just switching the compiler over to Clang (still running on that AMD &amp; Linux) <strong>there's a major perf hit of -5% and -17% (respectively) on those same two scenes</strong>!! MSVC (on AMD) looks to be a bit of a mixed bag where some scenes are more performant with final and others ones take a significant hit.</p>

<p>Apple's M1 is somewhat interesting where the gains and hits are very minimal, but GCC has a significant benefit for two scenes.</p>

<p>Whether there were many (or few) virtual objects had next to no correlation if <code>final</code> was a performance boon or hit.</p>



<h3>Clang Concerns Me</h3>

<p>PSRayTracing also runs on Android and iOS. Most likely a small fraction of apps available for these platforms are written in C++, but there are some programs that make use of language for performance reasons on the two systems. <strong>Clang is the compiler that is used for these two platforms.</strong></p>

<p>I unfortunately don't have a framework in place to test performance on Android and iOS like I do with desktop systems But I can do a simple "<em>render-scene-with-same-parameters-one-with-final-and-one-without</em>" test as the app reports how long the process took.</p>

<p>Going from the data above, my hypothesis was that both platforms would be less performant with <code>final</code> turned on. By how much, I don't know. Here are the results:</p>

<ul>
	<li>iPhone 12: I saw no difference; With and without <code>final</code> it took about 2 minutes and 36 seconds to perform the same render.</li>
	<li>Pixel 6 Pro: <code>final</code> was slower. It was 49 vs 46 seconds. A difference of three seconds might not seem like much, but that is a 6% slowdown; that is fairly significant. (clang 14 was used here BTW).</li>
</ul>

<p>If you think I'm being a little silly with these tiny percentages, please take a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPR8h4-qZdk">Nicholas Ormrod's 2016 CppCon talks about optimizing <code>std::string</code> for Facebook</a>. I've referenced it before and will continue to do it.</p>

<p>I have no idea if this is a Clang issue or an LLVM one. If it is the latter, this may have implications for other LLVM languages such as Rust and Swift.</p>



<h3>For The Future (And What I Wish I Did Instead):</h3>

<p>All in all this was a very fascinating detour; but I think I'm satisfied with what's been discovered. If I could redo some things (or be given money to work on this project):</p>

<ol>
	<li>Have each scene be able to report some metadata. E.g. number of objects, materials, etc. It is easily doable but didn't seem worth it for this study of <code>final</code>.</li>
	<li>Have better knowledge of Jupyter+Pandas. I'm a C++ dev, not a data scientist. I'd like to be able to understand how to better transform the measured results and make it look prettier.</li>
	<li>A way to run the automated tests on Android and iOS. These two platforms can't easily be tested right now and I feel like this is a notable blindspot</li>
	<li><code>run_verfication_tests.py</code> is turning more into an application (as opposed to a small script).
	<ul>
		<li>Features are being bolted on. Better architecture is needed soon.</li>
		<li>Saving and loading testing state was added, but this should have been something from the start and feels like more of a hack to me</li>
		<li>I wish the output of the results were in a JSON format first instead of CSV. I had to fuddle with PyExcel more than desired.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>PNGs are starting to get kinda chunky. One time I ran out of disk space. Lossless WebP might be better as a render output.</li>
	<li>Comparing more Intel chips, and with more compilers. The i7 was something I had lying around.</li>
</ol>



<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>In case you skimmed to the end, here's the summary:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Benefit seems to be available for GCC.</li>
	<li>Doesn't affect Apple's chips much at all.</li>
	<li>Do not use <code>final</code> with Clang, and maybe MSVC as well.</li>
	<li>It all depends on your configuration/platform; <strong>test &amp; measure to see if it's worth it.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><u>Personally, I'm not turning it on. And would in fact, avoid using it. It doesn't seem consistent.</u></p>

<p>For those who want to look at the raw data and the Jupyter notebook I used to process &amp; present these findings, <a href="https://gitlab.com/define-private-public/PSRayTracing/-/tree/b275e22c5adaa0d576f788cbdfbe7f15f08c6196/final_keyword_experiment">it's over here</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to take a look at the project, <a href="https://github.com/define-private-public/PSRayTracing">it's up on GitHub </a>(but the active development is done <a href="https://gitlab.com/define-private-public/PSRayTracing/">over on GitLab</a>). Looking forward to the next time in one year when I pick up this project again. 😉</p></div></div>]]></description>
