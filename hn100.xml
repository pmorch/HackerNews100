          <p>In recent months, the AI industry has started <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/openai-releases-new-simulated-reasoning-models-with-full-tool-access/">moving toward</a> so-called <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/china-is-catching-up-with-americas-best-reasoning-ai-models/">simulated reasoning models</a> that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/claude-3-7-sonnet-debuts-with-extended-thinking-to-tackle-complex-problems/">use a "chain of thought" process</a> to work through tricky problems in multiple logical steps. At the same time, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/new-apple-study-challenges-whether-ai-models-truly-reason-through-problems/">recent</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/new-study-shows-why-simulated-reasoning-ai-models-dont-yet-live-up-to-their-billing/">research</a> has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/researchers-concerned-to-find-ai-models-hiding-their-true-reasoning-processes/">cast doubt</a> on whether those models <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/with-the-launch-of-o3-pro-lets-talk-about-what-ai-reasoning-actually-does/">have even a basic understanding of general logical concepts</a> or an accurate grasp of their own "thought process." Similar research shows that these "reasoning" models can often produce incoherent, logically unsound answers when questions include irrelevant clauses or deviate even slightly from common templates found in their training data.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01191">a recent pre-print paper</a>, researchers from the University of Arizona summarize this existing work as "suggest[ing] that LLMs are not principled reasoners but rather sophisticated simulators of reasoning-like text." To pull on that thread, the researchers created a carefully controlled LLM environment in an attempt to measure just how well chain-of-thought reasoning works when presented with "out of domain" logical problems that don't match the specific logical patterns found in their training data.</p>
<p>The results suggest that the seemingly large performance leaps made by chain-of-thought models are "largely a brittle mirage" that "become[s] fragile and prone to failure even under moderate distribution shifts," the researchers write. "Rather than demonstrating a true understanding of text, CoT reasoning under task transformations appears to reflect a replication of patterns learned during training."</p>
<h2>No one trained me for this!</h2>
<p>To test an LLM's generalized reasoning capability in an objective, measurable way, the researchers created a specially controlled LLM training environment <a href="https://github.com/ChengshuaiZhao0/DataAlchemy">called DataAlchemy</a>. This setup creates small models trained on examples of two extremely simple text transformations—an <a href="https://www.dcode.fr/rot-cipher">ROT cypher</a> and <a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/icee/2010/3997d483/12OmNvo67DA">cyclical shifts</a>—followed by additional training that demonstrates those two functions performed in various orders and combinations.</p>

<p>These simplified models were then tested using a variety of tasks, some of which precisely or closely matched the function patterns in the training data and others that required function compositions that were either partially or fully "out of domain" for the training data. For instance, a model trained on data showing two cyclical shifts might be asked to perform a novel transformation involving two ROT shifts (with basic training on what a single example of either shift looks like). The final answers and reasoning steps were compared to the desired answer using <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/evaluate-metric/bleu">BLEU scores</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Levenshtein Distance</a> for an objective measure of their accuracy.</p>
<p>As the researchers hypothesized, these basic models started to fail catastrophically when asked to generalize novel sets of transformations that were not directly demonstrated in the training data. While the models would often try to generalize new logical rules based on similar patterns in the training data, this would quite often lead to the model laying out "correct reasoning paths, yet incorrect answer[s]." In other cases, the LLM would sometimes stumble onto correct answers paired with "unfaithful reasoning paths" that didn't follow logically.</p>

<p>The researchers went on to test their controlled system using input text strings slightly shorter or longer than those found in the training data, or that required function chains of different lengths than those it was trained on. In both cases the accuracy of the results "deteriorates as the [length] discrepancy increases," thus "indicating the failure of generalization" in the models. Small, unfamiliar-to-the-model discrepancies in the format of the test tasks (e.g., the introduction of letters or symbols not found in the training data) also caused performance to "degrade sharply" and "affect[ed] the correctness" of the model's responses, the researchers found.</p>

<h2>“A false aura of dependability”</h2>
<p>Using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to introduce even a small amount of relevant data to the training set can often lead to strong improvements in this kind of "out of domain" model performance. But the researchers say that this kind of "patch" for various logical tasks "should not be mistaken for achieving true generalization. ... Relying on SFT to fix every [out of domain] failure is an unsustainable and reactive strategy that fails to address the core issue: the model’s lack of abstract reasoning capability."</p>
<p>Rather than showing the capability for generalized logical inference, these chain-of-thought models are "a sophisticated form of structured pattern matching" that "degrades significantly" when pushed even slightly outside of its training distribution, the researchers write. Further, the ability of these models to generate "fluent nonsense" creates "a false aura of dependability" that does not stand up to a careful audit.</p>
<p>As such, the researchers warn heavily against "equating [chain-of-thought]-style output with human thinking" especially in "high-stakes domains like medicine, finance, or legal analysis." Current tests and benchmarks should prioritize tasks that fall outside of any training set to probe for these kinds of errors, while future models will need to move beyond "surface-level pattern recognition to exhibit deeper inferential competence," they write.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/1032732/3334850da49689e1/">https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/1032732/3334850da49689e1/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44872313">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>
<a href="https://stardict-4.sourceforge.net/index_en.php">StarDict</a> is a
GPLv3-licensed cross-platform dictionary application. It includes dictionaries
for a number of languages, and has a rich plugin ecosystem. It also has a
glaring security problem: while running on X11, using Debian's default configuration,
it will send a user's text selections over unencrypted HTTP to two remote servers.
</p>

<p>
On August&nbsp;4, Vincent Lefevre
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20250804092217.GA962280@qaa.vinc17.org/">
reported</a> the problem to the oss-security mailing list and to
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1110370">
Debian's bug tracker</a>.
He identified it while testing his setup before the
upcoming Debian&nbsp;13 ("trixie") release.
Installing StarDict will also
install the <tt>stardict-plugin</tt> package by default, because the former
recommends the latter. The plugins package contains a set of commonly used
StarDict plugins, including a plugin for
<a href="https://www.youdao.com/">
YouDao</a>, a Chinese search engine that supplies Chinese-to-English
translations. The plugin also contacts a second online Chinese dictionary,
<a href="https://dict.cn/">
dict.cn</a>.
</p>

<p>
This would normally not be much cause for concern; of course a dictionary
program will include code to talk to dictionary-providing web sites. But one of
StarDict's features, which is also enabled by default, is its "scan"
functionality: it will watch the user's text selections (i.e. text highlighted
with the mouse), and automatically
provide translations as a pop-up. Taken together, the two features result in any
selected text being sent to both servers. This only occurs while StarDict is
open, but the application is designed to be left open in the background in case
the user needs a quick reference while reading.
</p>

<blockquote>
The staff here at LWN.net really appreciate the subscribers who make
our work possible. Is there a chance we could interest you in <a href="https://lwn.net/Promo/daroc2/claim">becoming one of them</a>?
</blockquote>
<p>
StarDict on Wayland doesn't have this problem, because Wayland
prevents applications from being
able to capture text from other applications by default. That does mean that it
breaks StarDict's scan feature, though.
</p>

<p>
Xiao Sheng Wen, the Debian package maintainer for StarDict,
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1110370#10">
didn't see a problem</a> with the behavior, noting that if a user doesn't want
to use the scan functionality or the YouDao plugin, both can be disabled.
Lefevre
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1110370#29">
wasn't satisfied</a> with that, saying:
</p>

<blockquote>
But this is not the whole point. Features with privacy concerns
should never be enabled by default (unless the feature is the
only purpose of the package, and such a package would never be
installed automatically — and even in such a case, there should
be a big warning first).
</blockquote>

<p>
In response, Xiao
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1110370#34">
pointed out</a> that
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/trixie/stardict-gtk">
the package description</a> can be read by any
user who chooses to install the software, and it does mention the scan feature.
That said, I noted during my investigation that the
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/trixie/stardict-plugin">
description</a> of <tt>stardict-plugin</tt> did
not mention that the YouDao plugin uses an online service instead of an offline
dictionary. Xiao suggested splitting the networked dictionary plugins into a
separate package, but was "<q>not sure whether it's very necessary to do so</q>".
</p>

<p>
It is worth noting that the scan feature, while obviously a problem in this
context, is one of the reasons that a user might choose to use StarDict over an
alternative. Reading foreign-language media is often easier when words can be
sought in a dictionary with as little fuss as possible. From that perspective,
it makes sense that Xiao might not view the feature as problematic.
</p>

<p>
Any user who did read the description of the package, and who knew what the
YouDao plugin would do, might nevertheless expect the resulting communication to
at least be encrypted. But the plugin actually reaches out to its backend
servers — dict.youdao.com and dict.cn — over unsecured HTTP. So, not only are
these servers sent any text the user selects, but anyone who can view traffic
anywhere along its path can see the same thing.
</p>

<p>
This is not even the first time that StarDict has sent user selections to the
internet; the
same kind of problem
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=534731">was
reported</a> by Pavel Machek in 2009 and
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=806960#5">again</a>
by "niekt0" in 2015. The 2009 bug was solved by patching
the application's default configuration to disable networked dictionaries. That
appears to have worked for a time, but the YouDao plugin, which was added in
2016, does not respect the
configuration option. The 2015 problem was not fixed
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=806960#57">until
August 6 of this year</a> (although the package was removed from Debian for
unrelated reasons for a few months from 2020 to 2021). That fix just removed the
<tt>stardict_dictdotcn.so</tt> plugin, which also sent translation requests to
dict.cn and was later subsumed by the YouDao plugin,
from the package. In fairness to Xiao, he
was not the
StarDict maintainer in 2015 —
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150912065912/https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/stardict">
that was</a> Andrew Lee — but Xiao
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=806960#28">knew</a>
about the 2015 bug since at least 2021, even if he didn't consider it a priority.
</p>

<p>
According to Debian's
<a href="https://qa.debian.org/popcon.php?package=stardict">package popularity
contest statistics</a>,
only 178 people have
StarDict installed, down from around a thousand between 2009 and 2015.
That obviously doesn't capture people who have configured
their Debian system not to participate in the statistics collection, but it does
suggest there were a number of people who might have been broadcasting their text
selections to the internet for several years. Given that people copy and
paste passwords from their password managers, or select the text of sensitive
emails and documents during the course of editing, that should be a significant cause
for concern.
</p>

<p>
Debian is a large distribution, containing tens of thousands of packages.
Moreover, because of its commitment to stability, a decent fraction of these
are older software with delayed or sporadic updates. The reality is that Linus's
law ("<q>given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow</q>") only holds up if
people are looking — and if, once they have looked, and have reported things,
the people who have taken up maintenance of the software actually agree that
there is a problem.
</p>

<p>
Part of the justification for moving to Wayland over X11 is to make security
vulnerabilities relating to one application spying on another more difficult to
introduce. That obviously has to be balanced against the
cost of adapting to a new way of doing things, but it's not hard to see why so
many people are eager to make Wayland work. Maybe, in the future, StarDict's
default behavior would
have had little to no impact. Or maybe StarDict would have started asking for
special permissions to let it work on Wayland, and users would have accepted
those defaults the same way they currently do.
</p>

<p>
Either way, the existence of serious security problems that can be
found, diagnosed, reported, and still remain unfixed is cause for concern. Linux
has long enjoyed a reputation for security; maintaining that reputation depends
on the developers, maintainers, and users of open-source software caring enough
to fix security problems when they arise.

<p>This is a blog post based on a transcript of a talk by Devine on November 26th 2022. Watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TJuOwy4aGA" target="_blank">video version</a> on (YouTube). The slideshow presentation was made using <a href="https://100r.co/site/adelie.html">Adelie</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you to Matt Mascarenhas for providing us with an auto-transcript, it would have taken us ages to put this text together without it.</p>

<p>While we are grateful to have had the opportunity to give this presentation, an event in 2025 has resulted in us distancing ourselves from the conference responsible for hosting this talk. Below is a text by Devine explaining the situation.</p>

<details>
    <summary>Click to expand</summary>
 		<p><b>February 2025.</b><i> Some months ago, attendees of the Handmade Seattle conference expressed their grievances with the November 2024 conference in regards to its pivoting to include talks with mentions of social justice awareness and a slightly more diverse panel of speakers, at the cost of the usual guy-packs-bytes-in-the-right-sequence talks. Which I have nothing against as someone who tend to give talks of that exact flavor.<br>
		In any case, the conference organizer apologized for the poor selection of speakers which did not correspond to the expectations of ticket holders, promising to resolve the issue in the following year, and in passing, that free and open source software developers would no longer be welcomed as speakers.<br>
		I happened to be present in the chatroom when the apology letter went out and merely questioned whether the choice was really about the lack of low-level talks, and not something else. It did not take long for bigots of all sorts to come out and lament the good old days of the conference and soon the chatroom was ablaze with some pretty vile things against trans people, this went on for hours without intervention, the usual.<br>
		What I did not expect was for the conference organizer, who ghosted me for months, to finally break radio silence to slam me for speaking out and partially blaming me for the unraveling of the conference organization, and decided against covering the agreed upon travel stipend. I have since requested for the talk videos to be removed from their YouTube channel, Vimeo, and their website.</i><br>Reposted from <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/now.html" target="_blank">xxiivv.com</a></p>

<h2>Weathering Software Winter</h2>

<p>I work with a little studio called Hundred Rabbits, it is a small collective of two which operates from a small solar-powered sailboat. All of our devices are donated, discarded devices. Our <a href="https://100r.co/site/philosophy.html">philosophy</a> is that to make fast software, you need slow computers, and we've tried to espouse this as much as we could. We spend our time sailing around, and doing experiments with resilience, that covers computers, but we also touch on food security, preservation, and on studying past technologies that could be used today in times of crisis.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_04.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>We started sailing seven years ago, it took us all around the Pacific. We went through <a href="https://100r.co/site/mexico.html">Mexico</a>, <a href="https://100r.co/site/french_polynesia.html">French Polynesia</a>, <a href="https://100r.co/site/new_zealand.html">New Zealand</a>, up through <a href="https://100r.co/site/fiji.html">Fiji</a>, <a href="https://100r.co/site/japan.html">Japan</a>, and then followed the Russian Coast, brushing by Alaska before returning to <a href="https://100r.co/site/western_canada.html">Western Canada</a>. Our thinking was that we could keep doing art, music, and video games as we sailed around, but it soon became obvious that all the technology that we took for granted, and that we had with us, was not designed to leave the Western world.</p>

<p>The moment we cast off from Mexico, all of our devices started breaking down. In his 2022 Handmade Seattle opening speech, Abner was making a point about the Roombas starting to fail. If your Roomba fails, you pick up a broom, but on a sailboat you depend on devices working to find your position, knowing the weather, etc. These things have a more direct impact on your survival, and all of that technology is built on the same stack as the Roomba.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_05.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Many of the tools that we thought we could rely on broke down, whether it is Apple products, or software that require subscription services, <abbr title="Digital Rights Management">DRM</abbr>, etc. As an artist you spend time developping a skill, you become a Photoshop illustrator. When your connection to the internet fails and that the software locks up, that skill that you thought was yours was actually entirely owned by someone, and can be taken away.</p>

<p>Even though we've been paying for this sort of software for years, the moment that you can't have access to authenticate yourself that skill is gone. We didn't expect this, it scared us.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_06.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Nowadays, everything is built on the cloud. While sailing along the US coast in early 2016, we'd stop by conferences to see all the happenings in tech. We would speak with people at the booths, and they would try and sell us their product, but we'd have to stop them mid-sentence to ask, "Does it work offline?" 99% of times people say, "ah, yeah no, sorry. It's on the cloud."</p><p>It seemed that no one was building things that we could use. This was a sad realization. I love programming, and for a time it seemed that it was utterly incompatible with our new way of life.</p>

<p>Before I go on any further, I will paint you a picture of what it looks like to try to use modern stacks when away from the shores of the Western world.</p>

<p>Imagine two people in a small sailboat in the tropics, somewhere like the Marquesas, or another island in the South Pacific Ocean. These islands are covered with beautiful lush forests, they require rain and sun, that's all, then there's us sharing that same space, busy lifting a smartphone in a Ziploc bag up the mast to try and get one bar of signal to update Xcode, which at the time was 11 gigs. We had a stack of cards, each worth two gigabytes of mobile data, but with Xcode you can't resume the download if it fails. We could swap the codes for the cards, and if we did it within 10 seconds it would detect a timeout and would continue. The problem is that if the download is not done by 1600, then the sun is setting, the solar panels aren't charging the batteries anymore, and our laptops are dying. The download is at 7 gigs with three more hours left to download the update, it won't finish, and we will have spent all that data for nothing.</p>

<p>This wasn't ideal. We tried to look for alternatives...</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> In 2016, we were publishing games for iOS, we used Xcode, as well as iPhones, and Macbook Pros. Rek used Photoshop to draw, having never been exposed to tools like Krita, and Gimp. We knew of Linux back then, but not well enough to consider it. As artists, we didn't think Linux could work for us (evidently, we were wrong). We'd always lived in cities, close to an internet connection. Updating Xcode on a fast and stable home connection was never a problem, we never looked at the size of any download because we didn't have to care. On land, we had seemingly infinite power, and we had bandwidth. When resources are scarce, then we had to start focusing on details like download size, and how much sun the day will bring. We were so focused on sailing that first year, that we didn't stop to think if it made sense to do iOS development while traveling. When we left Canada we were a bit naive, but we didn't know what we didn't know. Now, in 2023, Rek draws mainly by hand, and processes drawings with Gimp. Both of us use linux(Manjaro), and we don't own a smart phone. See <a href="https://100r.co/site/tools_ecosystem.html">tools ecosystem</a> for further details on our shaky beginnings.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_07.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>We noticed that all the software that we had written in the past was gradually becoming unusable. We grew up in Montreal, and many of our friends worked in <abbr title="Triple-A">AAA</abbr> studios like Ubisoft, making free-to-play games, building projects that had a lifespan of three years. The projects that we made in the past on the Apple stack, Electron, or on Unity3D, also had a lifespan of three to four years, but games like Super Mario, as well as others produced in that era, are still playable today. We are in a dark age, where game developers and artists spend years building games that quickly become lost <a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/stack.html" target="_blank">bitrot</a>. We'll never be able to play Scott Pilgrim on the PlayStation again.</p>

<p>Looking online, it seemed that others shared these concerns.</p> 

<p>In the above image are four philosophies of digital data preservation, they all have their flaws. Data preservation is a somewhat new field, we don't know what sort of data we'll be able to recover in a hundred years, but from the experiments that we've looked at, it doesn't look good. The <abbr title="The British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</abbr> had a project where they were trying to mimic one of their longest lasting books, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesday_Book" target="_blank">Domesday book</a>. It was written by monks a few hundred years ago. The <abbr title="The British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</abbr>'s thinking was that we still have this book today, we can still read it, do we have technology to make something like this? Is it possible to record our way of life today, so that people in a thousand years can see how we lived? They created the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Domesday_Project" target="_blank">BBC Domesday</a>, a disc that contained music, movies, and scientific papers. Then 10 years later, it was an unreadable, people forgot how to decrypt and decompile the disc. It seemed that there was no real way to preserve data long-term, and so we decided to try our own little experiment.</p>

<p>As a disclaimer, all that I am writing now is very naive. I draw, and I make music, when I started doing research I didn't have the vocabulary to find what I was looking for. I didn't know what virtual machines were, I didn't know what compilers were either. I had a vague idea of what programming was. I had written Swift and Objective C, but had no conception of how it actually tied to processors. It seemed like I was learning a service, the same way I was learning "To Photoshop". It wasn't like learning a skill, you don't learn to draw when you use Photoshop, you learn how to operate within the confines of someone else's playground, and when that rug is pulled from underneath you, there's nothing you can say or do, and you never really understood how it worked in the first place so you can't really replicate it.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_08.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>We eventually stumbled on the words <b>virtual machine</b>. With a Super Mario brother <abbr title="Nintendo Entertainment System">NES</abbr> file, I knew I could put it on a computer and I could run it, I could run it on my phone, I could run it on an old computer, I could run it on a Super Nintendo, I could also run a Super Nintendo emulator running Mario on a Nintendo 64. This seemed a good way of preserving data. We decided to not give up entirely on software, and to see what could be done in that space using virtual machines.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_09.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Hardware is extremely cheap, and because it is it's covering the world with e-waste, and all of it is there for the taking. Everyone has drawers full of old devices, Super Nintendos, Playstations, Dreamcasts, all of which are considered obsolete, people stopped developing games for them, but we thought we could give a second life to such devices. When looking into how this could be done, it led us to interesting places. We became interested in seeing how we could repurpose old electronics. There didn't seem to be any competition. If you do like everyone else, you're competing with everyone else. For example, if making iOS 10 software the marketplace is completely saturated, but if you're going be release an Atari game today, it's going to be huge. There's no one giving purpose to these devices anymore. We tried to do something completely left field. To start, our goal was to try and make games for the NintendoDS.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_10.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>So looking at a VM from the outside, without having a sort of academic background, the first thing you find is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine" target="_blank">JVM</a>. I've never written any Java, but I would go around and tell my friends who are actual programmers, "I'm gonna make the <abbr title="Java Virtual Machine">JVM</abbr>! It seems like this would solve our problem!" Their response was that the JVM was so fractalized, and that this wasn't what we were looking for. We found plenty of academic papers with no software written for them.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_11.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>I dabbled into the Java ecosystem, and I couldn't make heads or tails of it</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_12.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>I knew that we wanted to make playful little projects that could run on a variety of devices, on a sort of cross platform that was not Electron. Instead of always targeting the new modern thing, we thought we could make a <abbr title="Virtual Machine">VM</abbr>, or something other, that could run increasingly further back into the past.</p>

<p>There is an incredible amount of fast computers out there. The first time <a href="https://100r.co/site/donsol.html">I made an NES game</a>, I was surprised at how much stuff I could draw on the screen at 60 fps. I had somehow been convinced that modern technology was better, faster, and all the eight bit stuff had been solved problems, I thought that we had explored this problem space entirely.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_13.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>It didn't seem to be the case. There were a lot of ideas in the past that were forgotten, and I made it my mission to explore this. It was <abbr title="Coronavirus Disease 2019 (SARS-2)">COVID</abbr>, everyone was confined to their homes, it was the perfect time to figure out how computers work. We're going to look into the past to see how people did it, and what ideas were forgotten.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_14.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>There was a time when computers were super playful, but now they feel cold, and have been weaponized against people. The sort of playfulness that you'd find in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bob" target="_blank">Microsoft Bob</a>, I can't really find a parallel for today. I can imagine what Microsoft Bob would look like if made today, it would try to sell you all sorts of shit. I don't think we, as a society, have a system in place that would foster the creation of something as playful as this.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_15.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>A realization that I had working on something like this was that customizing your hardware, and your software, makes you care.</p>

<p>If you buy something off the shelf, like an iPhone, which you can't change, you're less likely to care for it, and it's going to end up in a drawer. Back then you could go to Radio Shack and get parts for your computer, it was possible to customize it (for example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800" target="_blank">Altair</a>), and then you could know it in its entirety. Devices that were customized, or built from near-scratch, are still loved, but as for your old iPhone6, you don't know where it is, and even if you did it's probably unusable. Devices like the iPhone6 can't be repaired, they are designed to fail in ways that are inscrutable.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_16.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Instead of trying to make things as broadly accessible as possible, we thought we'd try to see what we could do if we designed it for just one person, a sort of personal computing that was not designed to scale.</p><p>I can see the appeal of languages like Rust, I won't be learning it, but if you're convinced that you can use computers to solve problems, then obviously this will not be relevant to you. I think that if you are forced to use a computer, there is no way that it can be playful. There was a writer who said, "if you're forced to play, you can't play."</p>

<p>I don't have a smartphone. Walking in Seattle I saw the streets lined with lime scooters everywhere, to see the menu to be allowed to use a scooter you need to scan a QR code. There's a layer of reality that's being forced onto people to use technology.</p>

<p>This is not what I'm talking about here. What we're trying to do is something that is closer to your personal computer, something that would be designed and tailored to help you play.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_17.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>When we began looking at what VMs there were, we looked into the past, and that brought us to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk" target="_blank">Smalltalk</a>. I read this book called What the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_the_Dormouse_Said" target="_blank">Dormouse Said</a>, and it talked about the history of Stanford, and how people had this utopian idea of what computers could be. This is way before I even became interested in computers, learning what their vision was then made me optimistic about what could be done.</p>

<p>That was when I was first exposed to the idea of a virtual machine, or byte code. As I mentioned before, looking up information online without the vocabulary you need to find things is really difficult. There was no way I could go around learning about personal computing without spending some time learning Smalltalk.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_18.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Obviously, the moment that you start going that down that route, you will have people telling you that you really have to try <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_machine" target="_blank">Lisp machines</a>. I spent time learning about Symbolics and LVP. I learned about a sort of system where the whole thing could be inspected, a system that was trying to do computing in a very personal way.</p>

<p>Nowadays, it's akin to the browser, where you can go on a website that you like, and right click to inspect. It is less and less the case now, but for a while you could inspect websites to see how it was put together. This was empowering, emblematic of the era.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_19.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>This doesn't work on a <abbr title="Virtual Machine">VM</abbr> at all, but it's relevant because <b>Niklaus Wirth</b>, who wrote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberon_(operating_system)" target="_blank">Oberon</a>, wrote an entire operating system that came with a book.</p>

<p>The Oberon book is really nice, especially if you come into it with a clear mind, without prior knowledge or expectation of what programming is. The book explains how to build an operating system from scratch. It uses a language like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Pascal</a>, which is very easy to read, more beautiful than other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL" target="_blank">ALGOL languages</a>. One of the first things that it teaches you to do is how to draw pictures, which I thought was kind of interesting as someone who's very visually-inclined.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_20.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>In the book Niklaus Wirth mentions the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-code_machine" target="_blank">P-machine</a>. I was beginning to form an idea of what virtual machines were, and he just briefly mentions it, "oh! By the way, I wrote this Pascal compiler targeting a virtual machine." I was like, "a language can target a virtual machine?! What?" And the reason why it was so easy for him to port the compiler between platforms, is that the opcodes running it were extremely simple, and very few in number.</p>

<p>I thought then, <b>this</b> is a way to do data preservation that is appealing to me.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_21.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>I learned Pascal.</p>

<p>Pascal is a beautiful language. In the above image, I am running it in an emulator for the Macintosh. I loved that I could have a whole operating system running in a small window that wasn't Linux, that wasn't some big <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU" target="_blank">QEMU image</a>. It was a little self-contained system, which I could destroy, or start over with really quickly.  I could run it and do 3D at 60 fps by running the emulator at 128 times its speed, and thought that was cool, a testament to how fast computers are nowadays.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_22.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>That led me to learn about the history of C.</p>

<p>I migrated all my platform to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs" target="_blank">Plan 9</a>. Plan 9 has its own C compiler, and it's not quite C89, it's its own thing, a no-concessions system.</p>

<p>The people who built this weren't planning to make money with it, you can really tell that it's a product of love. That made me optimistic about what personal computing could be.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_24.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Plan 9 didn't run on a VM, but it inspired another system. The lessons that they learned during Plan 9 led to the building of something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(operating_system)" target="_blank">Inferno</a>, which runs on a VM.</p>

<p>I think I was starting to understand what <abbr title="Virtual Machines">VMs</abbr> were. If this entire operating system runs on a vm, this is what I wanna be doing.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_25.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>The scale of something like Inferno is quite big, but in an afternoon I could run through the whole C code for this virtual machine. The above (image) is the opcodes that it had.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_26.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>It was in part inspired from the actual hardware that ran the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Newton" target="_blank">Apple Newton</a>.</p>

<p>I could run it in an afternoon, and know exactly how it ran. I would look at the compiler that targeted the Dis virtual machine, and could see how they reduced the problem-space to a limited number of operations.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_27.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>The people who worked really hard in the past to get away from time-sharing system would laugh, or they would cry, at how we got tricked into falling back in that situation where computers were something that was done behind a wall. You have a terminal, but that's where your power ends.</p><p>

</p><p>I wanted a way of doing computers that nobody could take away from me.</p>

<p>I would read people who would write entire operating system on a weekend, but I couldn't even map this idea onto things I was seeing, a bridge was missing.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_29.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>The modern stack doesn't really work for us, it doesn't apply to the limitations that we have on the boat. We have 180 watts of solar. We just spent the whole summer with two 6-volt batteries, which is very small. When you're going down that route, at every turn people are telling to just put more solar panels, or to buy more batteries. That is such a modern way of solving your problem. In reality, technology like this(especially high-tech) rarely solves problems. It creates a lot of other problems, which on a sailboat is very immediate. Putting more solar would mean more windage, more chance of things flying off and cutting our limbs. More batteries would mean the boat would be heavier, it would stop us from being able to run away from storms.</p>

<p>The limits of a sailboat gives us a space for creativity, and these limitations became a sort of playground for us.</p>

<p>I am not the sort of programmer who could build Plan 9, or Oberon, or Lisp machines, but I knew I could write simple NES games and port them. I couldn't write an <abbr title="Nintendo Entertainment System">NES</abbr> game inside an <abbr title="Nintendo Entertainment System">NES</abbr> game, and that was such a shame. I wanted something that was completely bootstrapped.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_30.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p> So after looking at 6502, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64" target="_blank">Commodore 64</a> emulator was extremely complex, more complex than I could grasp. It was the limit of what I think a single person could understand. It seemed like a simple system, it was just a box, but writing an emulator for it was more than a weekend project. I was looking for something that I could nail in a single weekend.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_31.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>6502 has a lot of mnemonics. When trying to implement the 6502 as a <abbr title="Virtual Machine">VM</abbr>, it is possible to make a naive implementation in a week, or in a weekend if you don't do anything else. My knowledge of C is very limited, but luckily I had help. I wondered if this instruction set could be reduced further...</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_32.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>It got me thinking about complexity, and on what simplicity means. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Kolmogorov" target="_blank">Kolmogorov</a>, the mathematician, said that the index of complexity of any one system is the length of the program that could generate a specific string. I really like that way of looking at complexity and simplicity, because nowadays it's sort of convoluted. If you don't really know about hardware, it seems that everyone's trying to make the programmer comfortable, and not focusing on making an actual fast product.</p>

<p>Most of the people I know who are hobbyist programmers use type systems, memory safety, all sorts of <i>training wheels</i>(I'm kidding here, if you're a large team, please do use type systems for god's sake). When I work on my own, I want to reduce the problem space to as little a thing as I can make it. I don't like programming that much, and in the future I'm gonna hate it probably even more, so I want my future self to be able to reimplement my entire system at most in a weekend.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_33.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>So where does that bring me? 6502 is beyond the scope of what I was hoping to do, because having done it twice already, I don't think I'll have it in me to do it again.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_34.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Looking back at that same era with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs" target="_blank">Bell Labs</a>, this was a time when people would build paper computers to teach kids to understand what a program counter was, how things moved around in the program, and how to navigate byte code.</p>

<p>No one can take a paper computer away from you. As long as you have paper and pen you can still solve problems, albeit slowly, and more painfully, but this is a form of computing that can be easily ported.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_35.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>When I was looking at the <abbr title="The British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</abbr>'s Domesday book, I noticed that Alan Kay(Small Talk) also had a project that was in line with what I was trying to do. He thought, "Smalltalk is a vm, how much of a small VM can possibly run smalltalk-72."</p>

<p>He wrote a paper called <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2814228.2814250" target="_blank">The Cuneiform Tablets of 2015</a>, he had all these words to talk about computers that went viral. He said things like, "Lisp was the Maxwell equation of programming." As a minimalist geek I was glad to hear this, it's what I wanted, but then looking into Lisp, I thought that a language that creates garbage by design wasn't really what I was looking for. This was a bit more like it, but it was a register machine, and I didn't see how that mapped to Smalltalk.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_36.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>So <a href="https://sr.ht/~bctnry/chifir/" target="_blank">ChifirVM</a> is not exactly what I'm looking for, but there are plenty of other ways of doing computing out there. Instantly, I fell onto one-instruction set computers, like <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/subleq.html">SUBLEQ</a>. I thought it was a disgusting tar pit, but I could implement it in 15 minutes, and I would be really kind for my future self to make a system that could run on something that I could implement in 15 minutes.</p> 

<p>The problem was that the toolchain required to write things that could actually have any purpose for it was immense. There were people who wrote C compilers down to Subleq, but this shifts the whole complexity back to the compiler, and that doesn't solve my problem. </p>

<p>There were computing paradigms which I absolutely loved, so pure, so beautiful, but at the same time they mapped so poorly to silicone that they didn't really work for me.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_37.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p><a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/thue.html" target="_blank">Thue</a>(one of my favorites) is an esoteric programming language that has one operator, and only has a replacement rule. So you have an accumulator, which is a series of characters, and every rule, one for every line, is a replacement of what's on the left with what's on the right. It was very slow, but extremely powerful, and could be implemented in 30 minutes.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_38.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p><a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/fractran.html" target="_blank">FRACTRAN</a> was another <abbr title="One-Instruction Set Computer">OISC</abbr> system. It has one operation: multiply. Its primitives were not bytes, or shorts, but fractions. It used prime encoding, which was one of the most beautiful mathematical concept that I knew of.</p>

<p>For a while I thought I had found my bedrock, I was going to use fractions to make computers. The only issue... is that it maps poorly to silicone.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_39.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p><a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/logic.html" target="_blank">SKI calculus</a> was beautiful, it has this mathematical elegance to it. I went down that rabbit hole, and I barely emerged back alive.</p>

<p>I recommend everyone to take a Lisp detour, and then learn SKI, to read Smullyan, and to read about others like him who don't care about making products, but really want to explore software in a way that is very creative and artistic. I almost made this my bedrock, except that at the VM layer garbage collection was a bad idea.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_41.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p><a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/brainfuck.html" target="_blank">Brainfuck</a> has 7 instructions, implementing it would take 45 minutes, maybe an hour.</p>

<p>We are going up the abstraction chain here, and the pattern I was seeing was that the lesser a mnemonic or complexity that you reduced it to, the slower it got. Brainfuck was surprisingly fast, you could run a mandelbrot on a system that was quite small to implement, but that wasn't the sort of programming I wanted to do. It led me to another system...</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_H._Moore" target="_blank">Chuck Moore</a> never came up in my books about Stanford, he must have been some sort of outsider. FPGA is not something I was very quite familiar with, but people were trying experimental computing systems with them. It didn't matter, it was goo, you could shape it in any way you wanted.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_40.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Someone wrote an <abbr title="Field-Programmable Gate Array">FPGA</abbr> system called <a href="https://excamera.com/files/j1.pdf" target="_blank">J1</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Forth system</a>. It had very few opcodes, but had one of the most beautiful mapping of byte code I had ever seen. The Stack Machine primitives were implemented so you could combine them with each other, with weird combinations of bit toggles on a byte you could have really interesting esoteric stack manipulators.</p>

<p>I was smitten.</p>

<p>It's a 16-bit Forth system, the biggest literal you can have in one of those words would be like 35k fixed. The arithmetic was really beautiful, but the whole system's maximum program that it could run was four kilobytes.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_42.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>What I had in mind was slightly <b>more</b> than four kilobytes, but not much more. If I could have a full addressable, 64 would be really nice. I didn't want the complexity of the 6502.</p> 

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_43.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>The <a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/chip8.html" target="_blank">CHIP-8</a> is an interesting system that has a rich, vibrant community of people who build things for it during game jams.</p>

<p>The spec is quite simple, it fits on maybe two pages of paper, side by side. It feels like the paper computer in ways that I like, but it was not designed to be a general purpose driving <abbr title="Virtual Machine">VM</abbr>. It is meant to be building things in the scale of Pong. The keyboard is like a hex keyboard with just numbers on it. My plan was to build something that could build itself in it, so I'd need a keyboard, a cursor-a weird keyboard for me would not cut it.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_44.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p><a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?MachineForth" target="_blank">Machine Forth</a> was something I stumbled upon after. Chuck Moore wrote Forth, and then he thought it too complicated. I thought, "what do you mean it's complicated? There's like no syntax, no nothing. It's space-divided language. Implementing a Forth system is really fast." Chuck More, being himself, thought that he could do without all this 'cruft'. He reduced even further to Machine Forth which has 32, or 24 opcodes.</p>

<p>I kept seeing Forth over and over again, and couldn't really grasp, or see the beauty in it for a while. If you've just come from Lisp, you have whiplash when you fall into Forth. It has similar beauty. Lisp would be prefix, Forth would be <a href="http://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/notation.html" target="_blank">postfix</a>. Following that mindset you think you could be anyone, or you could do anything, and you chose to be Algol, why?</p>

<p>Going back and forth between Forth and Lisp, I couldn't make up my mind, but I kept seeing people who would fall in love with Forth, but were really bad at selling it. With Lisp it's really hard to find any Lisp code that you can actually copy/paste in a project because everyone's using weird macros, and libraries, and nothing is portable.</p>

<p>Forth had a different problem, everyone I'd talk to would say Forth was the best, and that I should really use it, but then I'd ask them questions like, "how do I calculate the distance between two points?" I walked away from that interaction thinking, well, it seems like a lot of people like Forth, but don't write it. It was hard to find any code at all. I know Forth is not portable, but it was hard to find just actual use-case of Forth that wasn't someone trying to learn Forth by implementing Forth and then moving on back to Rust.</p> 

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_46.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>The way Forth works is really simple, you put stuff on a stack, it hits a token, pulls the item from the stack, etc. It doesn't have precedence rules.</p> 

<p>It seemed like a really good bedrock for the things I wanted to do.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_47.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>Machine Forth was something that was going to be something close to the metal, Forth at its core is something pretty close to Assembly, but I wanted something that mapped exactly to Assembly, something that would be like, 'one token would be one byte, or one short'. </p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_48.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>So after a while I picked a bunch of opcodes, and I'd shown them to my friends, and they were like, "these are bad." They were people I trust. If I'd been on my own, I would have likely given up and not done it, or would be writing JavaScript still. They were extremely patient with me, they understood what I was trying to do. People like Sigrid, Alderwick, and Andrew had infinite patience for my stupid questions, they would tell me, "I wouldn't do it this way, but here's something that you could use to improve your system."</p>

<p>In the end, I ended up with this napkin definition of a system that I kind of liked. My goal throughout this whole process was to make a system that could fit on a t-shirt. I might lose my computer, especially on a sailboat, but I don't want to keep preserving all the documentation.</p>

<p>When I started sailing I was doing a bit of Ruby, when came time to gather all the Ruby documentation that I would need to be self-sufficient, the amount was overwhelming.</p>

<p>Being at sea for 50 days straight (see <a href="https://100r.co/site/busy_doing_nothing.html">busy doing nothing</a>) we don't have access to StackOverflow, our questions remain unanswered, now imagine if the site was gone forever tomorrow. At sea, without internet, if I wanted to look up how to fill a polygon, I couldn't do it, but if I had printed it? There are languages that make this more accessible, and others that make it really hard. Not having a background in C, I found it really difficult to go off sailing without my C documentation, but it is very extensive, and very clunky.</p>

<p>My thinking is that I'm probably going to lose the book at some point in the future, but if my future self had that t-shirt they'd probably be okay. I tried to reduce everything that I could do to fit onto a t-shirt, that's as much as I afforded in bandwidth.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_49.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>If you're familiar with 6502 on the left (above image), it just looks like this vertical series of instructions. The little language I made is quite similar. You can map it one to one, and the resulting size of byte code is pretty much the same.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_50.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>You might be familiar with this sort of Assembly language, reading as a big vertical column of characters, but I wanted to use the beauty of Forth and make a language that would be verbose in ways that it resembled writing a little bit.</p>

<p>Every morning when I wake up, and I open my programs, I don't hate myself for not leaving comments because the code itself is a bit more readable and self-documenting.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_51.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>The first thing I tried to do was to make an assembler in that language. It was easy. The language is so simple that the assembler itself is also going to be simple. I generated a X86 application of the <abbr title="Virtual Machine">VM</abbr> that could run its own assembler in that language.</p>

<p>The assembler is <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/drifblim/" target="_blank">3000 bytes</a>.</p> 

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_52.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>It's nothing like a computer, but it will run bytecode. I felt like I had reduced the problems that I was solving with computers down to 32 things, and these 32 things I could probably implement in Fractran and Subleq, other more minimal computing systems.</p>

<p>It taught me about how the little functions you would use in JavaScript to convert a string into an end, you write it in Assembly, and it dispels the magic. Sometimes people say they love magic, but in truth they don't. I don't like magic at all, especially not when things start to break.</p>
 
<p>Douglas Adams said that, "The major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually turns out to be impossible to get at and repair." This is the situation I was in with programming. I wanted to understand the whole thing, and to have it be inspectable.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_53.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>From there I started to build dawing routines, etc. I started to make implementations of Basic, of games, or of other emulators.</p>

<p>I have been writing in this little language for two years.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_54.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>In a <a href="https://guide.handmade-seattle.com/c/2022/behind-crafting-interpreters/" target="_blank">sit-down talk</a> <a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/" target="_blank">Robert Nystrom</a> was encouraging everyone to make their own programming language and their own system. Many of the conference attendees share this view, but in other circles it is generally frowned upon. The first time I mentioned it to anyone I was laughed out the room. I liked to draw, and people were thinking, "what do you even know about computers?"</p> 

<p>I would love to see everyone's programming language, to meet someone new and to ask them: "show me how many opcodes you have."</p>

<p>It is telling about a person's mind.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_55.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>We built this little system that is tailored to host the games we make. It'll be alien to anyone else, and that's okay, we are not trying to sell you on this idea, what we want is for everyone to try and make their own personal computer instead of piggybacking on someone else's idea that's cluttered with artifacts. I don't think we've even begun to scratch the surface of what can be done with this.</p>

<p>A lot of people will try to tell you that we've tried everything with 8-bit, but by the time the <abbr title="Nintendo Entertainment System">NES</abbr> was out, most of the game genres that we have today didn't exist. There are immense amounts of space left to explore, but now everyone has moved on, to <abbr title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr>, <abbr title="Augmented Reality">AR</abbr> or other.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_56.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>I made this entire talk in black and white, and I could have done a system in black and white too, but I made it in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem" target="_blank">four colors</a>. Imagine how much power you have with four colors.</p>

<p>One-bit can be a totally evocative, things don't have to be visually busy all the time. I think this maximalism of 'I need all these features' and 'I need to be doing this and that,' is exhausting. Learning to live without float points is actually kind of nice. There is beauty in really simple systems, trying to always scale things to fit everyone's usage is foolish.</p>

<img src="https://100r.co/media/content/blog/wsw_57.jpg" loading="lazy">

<p>As a closing remark, I want to say that I don't think that my attempt is the best solution to data preservation, I'm not even sure if I'm gonna be able to use that system in five years, but at least it's one attempt at trying to preserve things.</p>

<p><a href="https://permacomputing.net/" target="_blank">Permacomputing</a> is inspired from permaculture, its goal is to build resilience. The resilience of permaculture comes from trying different ideas, and seeing what sticks. If we all jump on the same language, and the same ecosystem, it makes it really fragile when one individual can just buy the whole thing, then you're left with a system that was never truly yours.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2025/08/japans-largest-newspaper-yomiuri-shimbun-sues-perplexity-for-copyright-violations/">https://www.niemanlab.org/2025/08/japans-largest-newspaper-yomiuri-shimbun-sues-perplexity-for-copyright-violations/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44870895">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan’s largest newspaper by circulation, has <a href="https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/society/crime-courts/20250810-274484/">sued the generative AI startup Perplexity</a> for copyright infringement. The lawsuit, filed in Tokyo District Court on August 7, marks the first copyright challenge by a major Japanese news publisher against an AI company.</p>
<p>The filing claims that Perplexity accessed 119,467 articles on Yomiuri’s site between February and June of this year, based on an analysis of its company server logs. Yomiuri alleges the scraping has been used by Perplexity to reproduce the newspaper’s copyrighted articles in responses to user queries without authorization.</p>
<p>In particular, the suit claims Perplexity has violated its “right of reproduction” and its “right to transmit to the public,” two tenets of Japanese law that give copyright holders control over the copying and distribution of their work. The suit seeks nearly $15 million in damages and demands that Perplexity stop reproducing its articles.</p>
<p>The three plaintiffs in the suit are the newspaper’s headquarters in Tokyo, Osaka, and Fukuoka, all of which operate separately under Yomiuri Shimbun Holdings.</p>
<p>Japan’s copyright law allows AI developers to train models on copyrighted material without permission. This leeway is a direct result of a <a href="https://restofworld.org/2022/ai-backlash-anime-artists/">2018 amendment to Japan’s Copyright Act</a>, meant to <a href="https://restofworld.org/2023/japans-new-ai-rules-favor-copycats-over-artists/">encourage AI development</a> in the country’s tech sector. The law does not, however, allow for wholesale reproduction of those works, or for AI developers to distribute copies in a way that will “unreasonably prejudice the interests of the copyright owner.”</p>
<p>In a statement <a href="https://japannews.yomiuri.co.jp/society/crime-courts/20250810-274484/">sent to Yomiuri</a>, a Perplexity spokesperson said, “We are deeply sorry for the misunderstanding this has caused in Japan. We are currently working hard to understand the nature of the claims. We take this very seriously, because Perplexity is committed to ensuring that publishers and journalists benefit from the new business models that will arise in the AI age.”</p>
<p>Last fall, two News Corp–owned publishers, The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post, took similar <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/wall-street-journal-new-york-post-sue-perplexity-ai-c5d9554d">legal action</a> against Perplexity. Outside of the U.S., though, Perplexity has so far avoided much legal scrutiny. Competing generative AI companies, including OpenAI and Meta, have faced copyright infringement suits from major international publishers.</p>
<p>In India, a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7ze00ly1zo">joint copyright infringement suit</a> against OpenAI includes some of the country’s most established news publications, including The Indian Express, The Hindu, and The India Today group. In France, the country’s leading authors and publishers associations have filed suits against Meta, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/france-meta-artificial-intelligence-lawsuit-copyright-168b32059e70d0509b0a6ac407f37e8a">alleging economic “parasitism.”</a></p>
<p>In May, the Japan Newspaper Publishers and Editors Association <a href="https://www.pressnet.or.jp/statement/20230517_en.pdf">published an open letter</a> calling out AI companies for free riding off their copyrighted material and warning them to stop their scraping practices. The status quo “could cause huge damage to the business of news organizations,” the association wrote at the time. “If quality news content, which underpins democracy, decreases, the public’s right to know may be hampered.”</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div data-role="selectable">
    <p>Water is the most fundamental need for all life on Earth. Not every organism needs oxygen, and many make their own food. But for all creatures, from deep-sea microbes and slime molds to trees and humans, water is nonnegotiable. “The first act of life was the capture of water within a cell membrane,” a pair of neurobiologists wrote in a recent review. Ever since, cells have had to stay wet enough to stay alive.</p>
<p>Water is the medium in which all chemical reactions in an organism take place, and those reactions are finely tuned to a narrow range of ratios between water and salt, another essential ingredient in life’s chemistry. The cells in your body are permeable to water, so if the water-salt balance of the surrounding fluid — blood, lymph or cerebrospinal fluid, for example — is outside its healthy range, cells can swell or shrink, shrivel or potentially burst. An imbalance can cause brain cells to malfunction, losing their ability to manage ion concentrations across their membranes and propagate action potentials.</p>
<p>Although these effects of insufficient water are felt by every cell in the body, cells themselves do not cry out in thirst. Instead, it’s the brain that monitors the body’s water levels and manifests the experience of thirst — a dry tongue, hot throat and rapid onset of malaise — which compels a behavior: acquire water.</p>
<p>“These neural circuits that control hunger and thirst are located deep in primitive brain structures like the hypothalamus and brainstem,” said <a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/zachary.knight">Zachary Knight</a>, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco, who recently co-authored <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2024.10.028">a review paper in <em>Neuron</em></a> on the neurobiology of thirst.</p>

    <p>Because these brain areas are difficult to study — due not only to their location, but also to their composition, with many different cell types and crisscrossed circuitry — it’s only in the last decade or so that neuroscientists have begun to understand how thirst fundamentally works. The body, researchers have found, is filled with sensors that feed clues to the brain about how much water or salt an organism needs to consume. How those sensors work, or what they even are, continues to elude scientists. Their existence offers a tantalizing insight: Water may be fundamental to life, but thirst is an educated guess.</p>
<h2><strong>Environmental Sensing</strong></h2>
<p>To understand thirst in mammals, think of it less as the body stating a fact to the brain — “I need water” — and more as the brain monitoring its environment, the body. Like an ecologist sampling a river, the brain examines blood’s chemical composition to learn what the body needs.</p>
<p>In nearly all cases, the so-called <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-the-brain-protects-itself-from-blood-borne-threats-20230620/">blood-brain barrier</a> protects the brain from bacteria, viruses or other dangers circulating in the blood. But there are a few exceptions where the brain directly interfaces with blood, including in the circumventricular organs, deep in the brain near the hypothalamus.</p>

<p>Two of these organs — the vascular organ of lamina terminalis (OVLT) and the subfornical organ (SFO) — are sensory organs not unlike a nose or an ear. They act like scientists dipping a bucket into the body’s river of blood to test its health. The brain infers the body’s salt and water needs from that data and funnels the information to neural circuits in even deeper regions, which then can trigger what we experience as thirst — the scratchy throat, dry mouth and foggy brain that accompany desire for water.</p>
<p>The blood-testing organs don’t measure water levels but rather the concentration of salt, whose healthy range lies at almost <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1096-3642.2007.00311.x">exactly the same concentration</a> as that of the brackish intertidal water in which vertebrates first evolved (which is about one-third as salty as seawater). When the water-salt ratio is too low, we get thirsty. The human body is about 60% water, although that number varies from tissue to tissue (bone is 31%, the brain 73%, the lungs 83%). A change of between 1% and 3% in the blood’s water content, which is normally around 60%, is sufficient for the OVLT and SFO to initiate familiar, unpleasant feelings that motivate a behavior. If salt levels are high, the animal drinks.</p>
<p>But there is a disconnect between drinking water and correcting the water-salt balance. It takes 30 to 60 minutes for water to enter the bloodstream once it’s consumed, and the brain cannot wait that long to figure out if the body has the water it needs. It must make a decision more or less immediately; an animal can’t sit around and do nothing but drink water for half an hour.</p>
<p>So, the brain guesses. More of those mysterious sensors kick in. One roughly estimates the volume of water passing through the mouth and throat and sends an initial signal to the brain. A second signal comes from the gut — from specific cell types that respond to water, and even to the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2167-2">mechanical stretching</a> of the stomach as it takes water in. Within a minute, these signals reach the brain and block the neurons in the OVLT and SFO that were activated to trigger thirst. The thirst response shuts off; the throat cools, and the mouth becomes moist again.</p>

    <p>Thirst, though, represents only one side of maintaining homeostasis. Salt — more specifically, sodium — is one of the most important things an animal consumes. Animals need sodium for neurons to fire action potentials, for proteins to keep their shape and function, and for chemical reactions to occur inside cells — the everyday business of life. We need to maintain a concentration of sodium ions in the fluids of our bodies to enable all those functions. It’s the other side of thirst.</p>
<p>“There are only a couple of things that are so important for your body that there’s a completely innate drive to get it if you fall into deficiency,” Knight said. “Oxygen, food, water and sodium.”</p>
<p>However, animals like us do not experience salt desire as a powerful, controlling drive as we do with oxygen, food and water. Sensors signal salt levels to the brain; in addition to the OVLT and SFO, sensors in the heart detect the stretching of atria and ventricles. But there is no analogous salt pang when we need it, the way a stomach churns for food or a scratchy throat cries out for water. Instead, the need to consume salt is mediated by taste and the brain’s reward pathways. “The taste of salt is bimodal,” Knight said. “It tastes good at low doses; at high doses it tastes disgusting, like drinking seawater.”</p>
<p>Imagine the urge to eat a big bag of potato chips. If the body needs salt, those chips will cause a surge of pleasurable dopamine to flood the brain. If the body doesn’t need salt, that dopamine drip disappears. “It’s pretty much reinforcement learning,” said <a href="https://www.bbe.caltech.edu/people/yuki-oka">Yuki Oka</a>, a neurobiologist at the California Institute of Technology who studies how the body maintains homeostasis. “More dopamine means a repeated behavior.”</p>
<h2><strong>Everyone Thirsts Differently</strong></h2>
<p>Scientists monitoring a river collect data and then have a choice about whether to act on their findings. Similarly, just because the brain measures the blood’s sodium levels doesn’t mean it has to act on that information.</p>
<p>Take Elena Gracheva’s 13-lined ground squirrels. <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/elena-gracheva/">Gracheva</a>, a neurophysiologist at the Yale School of Medicine, studies these rodents, native to North American grasslands, to understand how specific brain regions control thirst. The 13-lined ground squirrel is an ideal model for this, she said, because it hibernates for more than half the year, without eating or drinking. “They’re like monks,” Gracheva said. “They don’t go outside for eight months. They don’t have water in their underground burrow.” How do they not get thirsty?</p>

    <p>It isn’t that the squirrels don’t need water. They do. Their bodies cry out for it. But according to Gracheva’s research, during hibernation their brain ignores the body’s signals.</p>
<p>In mammals, a drop in blood water levels (which means a simultaneous rise in salt concentration, all things being equal) triggers two coupled processes. The hypothalamus pumps out the hormone vasopressin, which tells the kidneys to retain water rather than let it out as urine, and the SFO kicks off the thirst drive to direct the animal to drink. However, while ground squirrels are hibernating, their <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adp8358">vasopressin levels jump</a>, but the animal still doesn’t drink. “The circuit for vasopressin was normal, but thirst neurons were downregulated,” Gracheva said. “These two pathways are uncoupled.” The body is trying to retain the water it has but does not act to consume more.</p>
<p>The logic of the disrupted circuitry is extremely powerful. “Even if you wake them up in the middle of hibernation, they’re not going to drink,” Gracheva said.</p>
        
        
<p>The underlying network that Gracheva studies in squirrels is universal in mammals, up to and including humans. But that same neurological logic doesn’t lead to the same behaviors. Humans drink a glass of water when they’re thirsty. Cats and rabbits mostly get water from the food they eat. Camels can burn their fat stores for water (which produces carbon dioxide and water), but they also consume gallons of it and store it in their stomachs for when they need it later. Sea otters can drink ocean water and excrete urine that is <a href="https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.204.11.1831">saltier than the water they swim in</a>; they are the only marine mammals to actively do this.</p>
<p>How each animal manages water and salt is specialized to its ecosystem, lifestyle and selective pressures. The question “What does it mean to be thirsty?” has no one answer. We each thirst in our own way.</p>

Attorney General Brian Schwalbe called Trump's actions "unprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful," and signaled his office will take action to challenge the administration.</p><p>"There is no crime emergency in the District of Columbia. Violent crime in DC reached historic 30-year lows last year, and is down another 26% so far this year," Schwalbe said in an X post.</p><p>"We are considering all of our options and will do what is necessary to protect the rights and safety of District residents," he said.</p><p>Trump's federalization of the city's police force relies on his authority under Section 740 of the district's <a href="https://dccouncil.gov/dc-home-rule/" target="_blank">Home Rule Act</a>, the decades-old law that established Washington's local government.</p><p>That section gives a president the power to order the district's mayor to temporarily hand over control of the Metropolitan Police force if the president determines that "special conditions of an emergency nature exist."</p><p>The emergency control is set to expire after a maximum of 30 days, according to the statute. That can be extended, but only if Congress passes a law authorizing it.</p><p>Although Trump has frequently complained about crime in the district, violent crime there has fallen to a 30-year low as of January, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/violent-crime-dc-hits-30-year-low" target="_blank">U.S. Department of Justice</a>.</p></div><div id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108184187" data-test="InlineImage"><p>U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to the press about deploying federal law enforcement agents in Washington to bolster the local police presence, in the Press Briefing Room at the White House, in Washington D.C., U.S., August 11, 2025. </p><p>Jonathan Ernst | Reuters</p></div><div><p><a href="https://mpdc.dc.gov/dailycrime" target="_blank">Statistics</a> from the Metropolitan Police Department also show that incidences of homicide, sexual abuse, assault with a dangerous weapon, robbery, and overall violent crime have dropped by double-digit percentages so far this year.</p><p>Federal <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/trump-orders-increased-federal-law-enforcement-presence-to-make-dc-safe-again/3972307/" target="_blank">law enforcement presence in D.C. </a>has nevertheless increased in recent days.</p><p>Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat who is the District of Columbia's nonvoting delegate in the House of Representatives, called Trump's actions "an historic assault on D.C. home rule," and a "counterproductive, escalatory seizure of D.C.'s resources to use for purposes not supported by D.C. residents."</p><p>"The administration is justifying the decision by misleadingly citing years-old statistics," Norton said.</p></div><div id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108184113" data-test="InlineImage"><p>Soldiers from the U.S. Army National Guard 42nd Infantry Division walk through streets in Washington, D.C. on June 13, 2025 ahead of a parade and festival the following day celebrating the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army. </p><p>Bryan Dozier | Afp | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>Trump, who had recently threatened to place Washington under <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/10/trump-crime-washington-dc-border-.html">federal control</a>, said Monday morning that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi is "taking command of the Metropolitan Police Department as of this moment."</p><p>He also said that he will deploy the National Guard to "help reestablish law order and public safety in Washington, D.C., and they're going to be allowed to do their job properly."</p><p>Trump added, "You're going to have a lot of essentially military, and we will bring in the military if it's needed."</p><p>D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser's office did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Trump's actions.</p><p>She had previously pushed back on Trump's characterization of her city.</p><p>"People are coming to our capital.

Vitess is one of PlanetScale’s greatest strengths and contemporary Vitess is the product of our experience running at extreme scale. We have made explicit sharding accessible to hundreds of thousands of people and it is time to bring this power to Postgres.</p><p>Neki is not a fork of Vitess. Vitess’ achievements are enabled by leveraging MySQL’s strengths and engineering around its weaknesses. To achieve Vitess’ power for Postgres we are architecting from first principles and building alongside design partners at scale.

The combination of a steady price per token and more token consumption caused app inference costs to grow about 10x over the last two years. Market leader Cursor introduced a $200 plan where before $20 was the default. The $200 plan has also been followed by Claude Code and others.</span></p><p>The top end of subscriptions is $200 today but power users find that they are extensively throttled if they use a lot of inference. That throttling comes in the form of rate limiting, using lower quality models, context window compression, and other techniques.</p><p>If you don't want to be throttled you need to pay for inference yourself. The open source family of coding tools (Cline, Roo, Kilo) is based on that principle: “never throttle the user”.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Reddit says that it has caught AI companies scraping its data from the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, so it’s going to start blocking the Internet Archive from indexing the vast majority of Reddit. The Wayback Machine will no longer be able to crawl post detail pages, comments, or profiles; instead, it will only be able to index the Reddit.com homepage, which effectively means Internet Archive will only be able to archive insights into which news headlines and posts were most popular on a given day.</p><p>”Internet Archive provides a service to the open web, but we’ve been made aware of instances where AI companies violate platform policies, including ours, and scrape data from the Wayback Machine,” spokesperson Tim Rathschmidt tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>The Internet Archive’s mission is to keep a digital archive of websites on the internet and <a href="https://archive.org/about/">“other cultural artifacts,”</a> and the Wayback Machine is a tool you can use to look at pages as they appeared on certain dates, but Reddit believes not all of its content should be archived that way.“Until they’re able to defend their site and comply with platform policies (e.g., respecting user privacy, re: deleting removed content) we’re limiting some of their access to Reddit data to protect redditors,” Rathschmidt says.</p><p>The limits will start “ramping up” today, and Reddit says it reached out to the Internet Archive “in advance” to “inform them of the limits before they go into effect,” according to Rathschmidt. He says Reddit has also “raised concerns” about the ability of people to scrape content from the Internet Archive in the past.</p><p>Reddit has a recent history of cutting off access to scraper tools as AI companies have begun to use (and abuse) them en masse, but it’s willing to provide that data if companies pay.

<p>In 1978, a dredging gang working for British Waterways was struggling with a problem. They were trying to clear obstacles on the Chesterfield Canal so they could stabilise a concrete wall — not an easy day’s work. But what really had them stumped was a heavy iron chain on the canal bottom. After various attempts, they hooked the chain to their dredger. That did the trick. A firm pull removed the chain and the block of wood on the end of it. The gang took a well-earned break for tea. </p>



<p>The tea break was rudely interrupted by a policeman in a state of some excitement. He had been passing the normally tranquil waterway when he could not help but notice a large whirlpool. By the time the crew returned to the scene, the canal had gone. “We didn’t know there was a plug,” protested one workman. And, in fairness, the canal was two centuries old, and so was the plug. Whatever records there may have been had been destroyed in the Blitz. The moral of the story: institutional memory is valuable, and if an organisation starts forgetting important matters (such as the existence of the plug) bad things happen. Expertise drains away alarmingly fast if not refreshed by activity. </p>



<p>It’s not easy, though. I was recently taken on a tour of the Bodleian Library’s portrait collection, and was struck by how hard our tour guides had had to work to recover basic information about the sitter and the artist, even in portraits just a few decades old. This wouldn’t be so remarkable, except that the entire reason for the Bodleian Library to exist is to preserve information in an accessible form. (Bodley’s librarian, Richard Ovenden, has written <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Burning-Books-RADIO-Knowledge-Power/dp/152937877X?crid=2ZENZAF1L4T8Q&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.l8Sn-789eZkldlDhy4hyHhzBMOGDhL5x7SBGWCcgk9HGjHj071QN20LucGBJIEps.Pf8k40P2vmwWszH810V989scJOJXxtloM2DBqsSinVI&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=burning+the+books+richard+ovenden&amp;qid=1744960198&amp;sprefix=burning+the+book%2Caps%2C98&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=timharford-20&amp;linkId=d1faa4128aa6adeea95584c476179c92&amp;language=en_GB&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Burning the Books: A History of the Deliberate Destruction of Knowledge</a> and is president of the Digital Preservation Coalition.) But the Bodleian is a library, not a portrait museum, and without constant attention, the natural order of things is not to remember, but to forget. </p>



<p>That means trouble. Consider Volkswagen’s disastrous scandal, in which the company designed its cars to fool emissions tests by regulators. No, not the scandal of 2015, which cost the company its reputation, its CEO and well over €30bn in fines, settlements and legal fees. I mean the scandal of 1973, in which VW was accused by the US Environmental Protection Agency of designing its cars to fool emissions tests by regulators. VW settled out of court and, it seems, spent the following decades forgetting what should have been a chastening experience. </p>



<p>A more tragic example is the pair of fatal Space Shuttle explosions, Challenger in 1986 and Columbia in 2003. These accidents seem very different. One was an explosion shortly after take-off, the other a break-up on re-entry. But the underlying errors that made them possible seem eerily similar. The Columbia Accident Investigation Board report noted that the same basic questions had emerged: why did both shuttles keep flying with known problems? And why did Nasa managers decide that it was safe to launch despite warnings from their engineers? To set the stage for Columbia, Nasa first had to forget all the lessons of Challenger. </p>



<p>There is more to institutional forgetfulness than forgetting one big thing, whether that is “if you cheat the EPA, they may figure it out” or “the canal has a plughole”. Organisations can also just forget how to get things done. </p>



<p>As a boy I was fascinated by the Lockheed TriStar airliner because of its unusual configuration, with one engine in the tail. You don’t see it much these days — the TriStar was not a commercial success. </p>



<p>I wasn’t the only person to be intrigued by the plane, but the organisational psychologist Linda Argote had a different reason to scrutinise it. Most aircraft get much cheaper to make with the benefit of experience — they are the canonical example of learning by doing. But the TriStar stayed stubbornly expensive to make. Argote wanted to know why. Her idea flipped the idea of learning by doing: what about forgetting by not doing? </p>



<p>In a 1990 article Argote and Dennis Epple concluded that Lockheed had made so few planes they were forgetting faster than they were learning. In particular, in 1977 and 1978 production slumped to just 14 TriStars in total, and by the early 1980s costs in real terms were higher than in 1975. </p>



<p>The economist Lanier Benkard later estimated that Lockheed’s cost-saving expertise tended to drain away alarmingly fast if not refreshed by activity, with a half-life of just over a year. We can’t generalise too much from that. Planes are planes, and every case is different. Still, anyone who has ever filed tax returns can attest that a year is easily enough time to forget how to do any complex process. </p>



<p>Forgetting can happen for many reasons. People leave. Physical archives are vulnerable to mould and fire and being misplaced. Digital archives tend to become unreadable as technology changes — indeed the final reference in the Wikipedia entry on organisational memory is a dead link to a lost NHS website. And sometimes organisations deliberately forget. The underlying cause of the Windrush scandal in the UK was that one part of the Home Office decided to make onerous demands that UK residents prove they had the right to live and work in the country, without knowing — or much caring — that another part of the Home Office had destroyed the records that made such proof possible. </p>



<p>More than 100,000 US government web pages disappeared after President Trump took office. It remains to be seen what is gone temporarily and what has been lost for ever. </p>



<p>It is easy for organisations to forget, even when they are trying to remember. Let’s not make this worse than it has to be, or it will be more than the Chesterfield Canal that we lose.</p>

<p>I love Markdown. I write faster and more natively in it than any other format or tool.</p>
<p>If we zoom way out, here’s the most basic philosophy of Markdown: replace complicated stuff with simpler stuff.</p>
<p>That’s all it does, really. It replaces some tedious nested taggy stuff with way simpler stuff that makes more visual sense and is  faster to type. At its core, Markdown is really just a bunch of macros.</p>
<p>This website runs on 6,000-ish Markdown files. They’re processed on the server – meaning the <a href="https://github.com/xoofx/markdig">Markdig library</a> from .NET processes them, then sends back the resulting HTML. I’m all-in on Markdown, to the point where I wrote my own online editor for it.</p>
<p>Server-side processing of Markdown is a pretty common model – most static site generators fundamentally do the same thing: they process the Markdown, turn it into HTML, and that gets sent to the server (via being written to files).</p>
<p>One of the philosophical points of Markdown is that you can mix it with HTML. Meaning, a Markdown parser is supposed to leave HTML alone – if a line of text looks like it has some tags, the parser should skip it.</p>
<p>This means you can do this:</p>
<pre><code>This is some **Markdown!**

&lt;img src="yay.jpg" /&gt;

This is some more ***Markdown!***
</code></pre>
<p>And that should work fine. The first and last lines will be processed and transformed, and the middle line will be left alone and output as it’s written.</p>
<p>These were <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#html">the original rules</a> around inline HTML in Markdown:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only restrictions are that block-level HTML elements […] must be separated from surrounding content by blank lines, and the start and end tags of the block should not be indented with tabs or spaces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn’t find the need for blank lines in <a href="https://spec.commonmark.org/0.31.2/#html-blocks">the CommonMark spec</a>, but just note that every Markdown processor might be a little different in this respect, so test.</p>
<p>Anyway, we’ll likely get HTML that’s something like this out of the above Markdown.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;This is some &lt;strong&gt;Markdown!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src="yay.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is some more &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Markdown!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Our <code>img</code> tag is intact and has been left alone.</p>
<p>This is great, and helps you in some sticky situations. You can effectively “escape out” to HTML when you need to.</p>

<p>However, this still leaves you with the problem where you might have a bunch of complicated, tedious HTML that forms a repeatable component of some kind that you don’t want to hand-manage and reproduce over and over. What if you want a Markdown-friendly way to represent a feedback form, or a tabbed UI, or a mortgage calculator, or something else way beyond the scope of text formatting.</p>
<p>For these situations, what you really want is to put a token or a placeholder in your Markdown, and have something else <em>expand</em> it later on into a larger, more complicated HTML construct.</p>
<p>What you sort of need is… Markdown for More Complicated HTML™.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements">Custom Elements</a>.</p>
<p>These have been around a long time. They tend to get lost behind all the attention paid to the big client-side frameworks like React, but the first public spec was published in 2013, finalized in 2016, and we’ve had broad browser support since 2018 or so.</p>

<p>Custom Elements can do a lot, but a core function is that they divorce the source markup from what’s effectively output into the DOM.</p>
<p>You can write X in the markup; the Custom Element will output Y into the DOM.</p>
<p>X is simple; Y is way more complicated.</p>
<p>X is written by an editor; Y is written by logical processing.</p>
<p>So, considered at that level, Custom Elements can be used as… HTML <em>macros</em>.</p>
<p>This means that when you combine them with Markdown, you get a really neat synergy of features.</p>
<ul>
<li>Markdown expands into text formatting</li>
<li>Custom Elements (that the Markdown processor ignores) expands into more complicated stuff</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider this scenario: you have a blog post which is Part 1 of a series. You want to let people subscribe to be notified about Part 2, but that involves a little widget of some kind in the HTML. And for whatever reason, you have to put this between two paragraphs.</p>
<p>What if you could do this:</p>
<pre><code>This is some **Markdown!**

&lt;subscribe-to /&gt;

This is some more **Markdown!**
</code></pre>
<p>(Remember, that middle line is HTML, so the Markdown processor will leave it alone.)</p>
<p>Then, in the browser, that <code>subscribe-to</code> tag will expand into something like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div part="outer"&gt;
  &lt;label part="label"&gt;Want to know when Part 2 is published?&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input part="input" type="text" name="email" placeholder="Give us your email"&gt;
  &lt;button part="button" type="button"&gt;Let me know!&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This is <em>exactly</em> what Custom Elements can do.</p>
<p>To be clear, this is <em>not</em> a tutorial about Custom Elements in general – there’s a lot of depth there – but just a joyful discovery of what happens when we combine them with hand-written Markdown and come to the conclusion that both Custom Elements and Markdown sort of operate on the same principle from the perspective of the writer: they replace simpler stuff with more complex stuff.</p>
<p>Custom Elements can just be simple tokens like the above (actually, what’s above is not quite valid, but more on that below), or you can expose configuration parameters to make them more usable in more situations:</p>
<pre><code>This is some **Markdown!**

&lt;subscribe-to buttonText="Get me the details!" /&gt;

This is some more **Markdown!**
</code></pre>
<p>You can even put stuff between Custom Element tags then use that in the processing and output. (You can go even further, by defining child tag structures and “slots” and all sorts of stuff that we won’t get into. Again, there’s <em>so</em> much depth there…)</p>
<pre><code>This is some **Markdown!**

&lt;subscribe-to&gt;

We'll use your email once, then delete it. _We promise!_

&lt;/subscribe-to&gt;

This is some more **Markdown!**
</code></pre>
<p>Guess what happens to that line between the <code>subscribe-to</code> tags? Yes, it gets processed by the Markdown engine, <em>because it’s not HTML</em> – there’s no tag on that line. So the Markdown engine will process it, but leave the line above and below it alone, resulting in this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;subscribe-to&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We'll use your email once, then delete it. &lt;em&gt;We promise!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/subscribe-to&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>During a bout of insomnia, I did some local testing of the general theory.</p>
<p>I had <a href="https://claude.ai/">Claude</a> vibe-code a simple Node script that read a Markdown file which looked a lot like the samples above (Markdown paragraphs above and below, with a <code>subscribe-to</code> Custom Element in the middle). Then it processed the Markdown – Custom Element included – and output the result into a file.</p>
<p><a href="https://deanebarker.net/tech/blog/images/custom-elements-markdown/content.txt">Here’s the Markdown source.</a> There are two <code>subscribe-to</code> tags in there – one simple version, and one with a bunch of options I thought up.</p>
<p>You can see that when the browser encounters this – </p>
<pre><code>&lt;subscribe-to /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>– it expands into HTML (in a shadow DOM) that ends up looking like this in the browser:</p>








<picture><source srcset="https://deanebarker.net/tech/blog/images/custom-elements-markdown/custom-elements-markdown.png?w=480" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img src="https://deanebarker.net/tech/blog/images/custom-elements-markdown/custom-elements-markdown.png?w=700" loading="lazy" width="700" height="167"></picture>



<p>Or this when you add some advanced options:</p>








<picture><source srcset="https://deanebarker.net/tech/blog/images/custom-elements-markdown/custom-elements-markdown-adv.png?w=480" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img src="https://deanebarker.net/tech/blog/images/custom-elements-markdown/custom-elements-markdown-adv.png?w=700" loading="lazy" width="700" height="201"></picture>



<p><a href="https://deanebarker.net/tech/blog/images/custom-elements-markdown/output.html">Here’s the output file.</a></p>
<p>(That’s raw HTML; you can view the source. Understand that it’s still <code>subscribe-to</code> in the source, but inspect the DOM and you can see what it effectively expands into. The JavaScript definition for the Custom Element is inline in the HTML doc. I used <a href="https://lit.dev/">Lit</a> as a base because it makes a lot of things <em>so</em> much easier.)</p>
<p>I just <em>love</em> this.</p>
<p>An editor has Markdown acting as text macros, Custom Elements acting as HTML macros, <em>and they can mix the two in the same file</em>.  Simpler things become more complicated things. They can use Gruber’s “escape hatch” to handle infinitely complexity while being abstracted away from verbosity.</p>
<p>This opens some lovely possibilities for page, layout, and element complexity and functionality while retaining the “I wrote it in a simple text editor!” joy that made Markdown so awesome to start with.</p>
<h2>Postscript: Minor Technical Note</h2>
<p>I’ve been lying to you a little in this entire document. You actually can’t do this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;subscribe-to /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Custom Elements cannot be self-closing (or a “void tag,” as they’re called). You technically have to do this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;subscribe-to&gt;&lt;/subscribe-to&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The self-closing version will work sometimes, kind of accidentally. Where it falls apart is when you put something between the tags, because the browser considers the self-closing tag as just the <em>opening</em> tag, which it then claims never closes.</p>
<p>But here’s how and why I started <del>lying to you</del> displaying the self-closing version.</p>
<p>Because – and stick with me here – here’s something <em>else</em> you can’t do: put your tag attributes on multiple lines.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;subscribe-to
  buttonText="I love getting email!"
  anotherAttribute="Another value"
&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This time, it’s not the browser that’s the problem – the browser is totally fine with you breaking out the attributes to their own lines. This time, it’s the Markdown engine. It looks at those middle lines and decides that they’re not HTML, not understanding that it’s logically part of the opening tag. This means that – you guessed it – the Markdown engine tries to process it and everything falls apart.</p>
<p>(As noted above, this might vary a bit between Markdown engines. Claude picked <a href="https://marked.js.org/">Marked</a> for this POC.)</p>
<p>I didn’t like that I couldn’t do this. I wanted to be able to break out all my attributes on their own lines.</p>
<p>To solve this, I had <a href="https://claude.ai/">Claude</a> vibe up a simple (?) Markdown pre-processor. So before the source Markdown got fed into Marked, some code in the Node app “fixes” the tag – reassembles it all back on the same line.</p>
<p>And, while I was doing that, I also “fixed” the self-closing tag issue. If the code detected a self-closing tag that contained a dash (which Custom Elements must), it changed it to an explicitly closed tag. That’s why I showed you the self-closing tag. But know that by the time it got to the Markdown engine, it was explicitly closed.</p>
<p>It was just cleaner and less confusing while I was early in the explanation.</p>
<p>Here’s the source of the Node app with the preprocessor in a (pretty gross-looking) function called <code>preprocessMarkdown</code>.</p>
<p>(Full disclosure: I didn’t even bother to check this. It was just a POC, so I had Claude write it. I could have written it myself, but didn’t want to put in the effort for something with no larger goal.)</p>
<h2>Postscript: Fun and Madness with Markdown Preprocessing</h2>
<p>Once you crack open the door of Markdown pre-processing, you can be sorely tempted to head further down that road. For instance, if you don’t like the idea of raw HTML in your Markdown, you could essentially write your own mini-language.</p>
<p>For example, something like:</p>
<pre><code>@:subscribe-to
 buttonText: I love email!
 placeHolder: Give us your email!
</code></pre>
<p>All you have to do is write some preprocessing code that detects that construct and forms it into the Custom Element tag.</p>

<p>Is that “better” than raw HTML? I don’t know… maybe?</p>
<p>The looming problem is that this is just one simplistic Custom Element example. When you get into more advanced features like child tag structures and slots and such, you’d probably end up re-interpreting and re-implementing <em>way</em> more of the HTML spec than you want to.</p>
<p>I predict there will be a point where you regret trying to do this. Pre-processing and the initial excitement of a domain-specific language is a siren that might lead you to your doom.</p>
<p>(I swear, I have never tried to do something this foolish… I <em>swear</em>…)</p>
<h2>Postscript: Fun with Language Design</h2>
<p>When you realize that Custom Elements effectively abstract writing HTML away from deeper logical programming, you realize that designing the logical interface of your Custom Elements is a fun exercise in language design.</p>
<p>The basic principle becomes: <em>don’t ask for anything you don’t absolutely need</em>. Do as much work as possible for your editors in code. Require them to provide as little information as possible.</p>
<p>If we want to embed a feedback form, for instance, we could do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;input-form submitButtonText="Send message!"&gt;
  &lt;input-text label="Your Name" spec="required &gt;4" /&gt;
  &lt;input-text label="Your Email" spec="required email" /&gt;
  &lt;input-text label="Ticket Number" spec="required regex:[A-Z]{2}[0-9]{4}" /&gt;
  &lt;input-text label="Your Message" spec="required multiline" /&gt;
  &lt;submit-message&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thanks for your submission! We normally respond in two business days.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/submit-message&gt;
&lt;/input-form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This provides everything we (the developers) need to render a feedback form.</p>
<ul>
<li>We control the layout, so we’ll expand those <code>input-text</code> tags into multi-tag constructs to render each field.</li>
<li>We can assume that things like the form <code>METHOD</code> and <code>ACTION</code> are standardized to the site, so we don’t need to ask for those.</li>
<li>We can automatically obtain the URL/page from which they submitted. We could even develop some system where data from specific <code>META</code> tags in the <code>HEAD</code> are written to the form in hidden fields, meaning additional data can be injected into the form at the page templating level.</li>
<li>We assume the form needs a submit button, so there’s no need to specify it.</li>
<li>We can provide an “override default setting” model, where lots of stuff have default values that will be used if not provided. For example, I’m passing in <code>submitButtonText</code>, but that would certainly have a default value (“Submit Form”) that would be used if I didn’t feel like changing it.</li>
<li>Inside the <code>input-text</code> tags, we can roll up validation (<code>required</code>, <code>&gt;4</code> meaning at least five characters) and UI (<code>multiline</code>) specification into the same <code>SPEC</code> attribute, so we have no need for another tag for <code>textarea</code>.</li>
<li>We can derive all the field names from the <code>label</code>. Assuming we submit the form with client-side code, we could easily find the value of the the <code>label</code> for each input field via the <code>for</code> attribute, then serialize and submit that data as well, so the server would also get the “friendly name” of each input field.</li>
</ul>
<p>What we’ve done here is designed a specification language – two of them, actually.</p>
<ol>
<li>The combination of tags to specify the information we need to display and submit the form</li>
<li>The embedded <code>spec</code> values which define validation and UI variations</li>
</ol>
<p>This is really, <em>really</em> fun. You start to ask interesting questions about what information you actually need explicitly, and what information you can derive. You’ll find situations where you can make vast changes based on fun combinations of explicit information and environmental data.</p>
<p>It’s not hard to put together something that is unique to your specific situation and strikes a lovely combination among granularity, utility, and simplicity.</p>

<h2>Postscript: Processing Markdown Client-Side</h2>
<p>The original point of this post was about how to mix Markdown that’s processed server-side with Custom Elements that are processed client-side. As I noted, this is a common model, and the basis for all of the static site generation that happens these days.</p>
<p>But, what if you just wanted to process the Markdown client-side as well?</p>
<p>You certainly can. I’ve read that <a href="https://md-block.verou.me/">md-block</a> is quite good for this.</p>
<p>I don’t do it for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I still have weird hang-ups about sending content source to the browser. Something about airing my dirty laundry? It’s not entirely rational, and I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how it correlates to <a href="https://deanebarker.net/tech/blog/narratives/fourth-wall/">breaking the fourth wall</a>.</li>
<li>I wrote a bunch of <a href="https://github.com/xoofx/markdig/blob/master/src/Markdig/MarkdownExtensions.cs">Markdig extensions</a> specific to my site and needs. I wrote these in C#, so I wouldn’t be able to port them to the browser (…I don’t think? <a href="https://developersvoice.com/blog/architecture/webassembly-wasm-and-net/">WASM</a> might be able to do it?). Some client-side implementations might have extension frameworks too (here’s <a href="https://zerodevx.github.io/zero-md/?a=advanced-usage.md#extensibility">an example of one in zero-md</a>), however my Markdown usage on this site extends back six years to when I was really a “C# or death” kind of guy.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
<li>Some of the extensions I wrote require information from the server, which means rendering the Markdown in the browser would require multiple round-trips back to the server to get information, and I don’t love this.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you did want to render client-side, there’s also a bit of a perspective shift needed. Somewhat ironically in the context of this post, you’d need to surround your Markdown in a Custom Element (like the aforementioned <code>md-block</code> tag).</p>
<p>This means that your Markdown rendering is a Custom Element on the same “level” as the Custom Elements we’ve been talking about above. The Custom Elements are not “embedded and ignored” by the Markdown engine, but rather they exist “alongside” the Markdown.</p>
<p>Depending on the Markdown library, you might need to close that tag before opening the Custom Element.</p>
<p>Like:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;client-markdown&gt;
  This is some ***Markdown!***
&lt;/client-markdown&gt;
&lt;subscribe-to /&gt;
&lt;client-markdown&gt;
  This is some more ***Markdown!***
&lt;/client-markdown&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Your need to do this probably depends on the library you use. I can’t generalize with any authority.</p>
<p>In the end, your document is now fully an HTML document, not a Markdown document that <em>becomes</em> an HTML document. It’s a minor perspective shift, but might have some cascading effects on things I’ve written above.</p>
<h2>Postscript: Processing Custom Elements Server-Side</h2>
<p>You can also do the opposite of the above – if your server-side process is running in JavaScript (so, something like Node, Deno, or Bun), you can render the Custom Elements into expanded HTML on the server and send the HTML.</p>
<p>I have never done this, but <a href="https://lit.dev/docs/ssr/overview/">Lit supports it</a>. They even have a library that will re-hydrate the resulting HTML into “regular” Custom Elements when the page is finished loading.</p>
<p>Clearly, unless you do that, you’re not going to get any interactivity, so this is mostly useful as a templating language (…I think? Honestly, I know very little about it, other than that it exists).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
	
<p>Over a decade ago, my family and I made the leap to move from Germany to the United States after the sale of my startup to Microsoft. In the years since, I’ve had the privilege of working with many exceptional human beings, including Hubbers, Microsofties, customers, partners, our GitHub Stars, open-source maintainers, and developers around the world who’ve helped us shape GitHub. From building mobile developer tools, to running the acquisition of GitHub alongside Nat Friedman, to becoming GitHub’s CEO and guiding us into the age of Copilot and AI, it has been the ride of a lifetime.</p>



<p><strong>Still, after all this time, my startup roots have begun tugging on me and I’ve decided to leave GitHub to become a founder again.</strong> GitHub and its leadership team will continue its mission as part of Microsoft’s CoreAI organization, with more details shared soon. I’ll be staying through the end of 2025 to help guide the transition and am leaving with a deep sense of pride in everything we’ve built as a remote-first organization spread around the world.</p>



<p>With more than 1B repos and forks, and over 150 million developers, GitHub has never been stronger than it is today. We have seen more open-source projects with more contributions every year. AI projects have doubled in the last year alone. And our presence in companies of any size is unmatched in the market. The GitHub platform has continued to lead with incredible momentum. We massively improved accessibility and availability, brought GitHub to the EU, Australia, and back to the US for FedRAMP certification, and fixed a ton of small and not-so-small papercuts. GitHub Advanced Security transformed the industry toward “found means fixed” with the power of AI, reducing mean time to remediation by 60% and enabling teams to fix vulnerabilities 3x faster. GitHub Actions has firmly matured into the world’s leading CI solution, now powering 3 billion minutes per month — up 64% year-over-year — fueled by many key ships and stability improvements.</p>



<p>And of course, together, we launched and scaled Copilot from a simple, but magical autocompletion tool to conversational coding with Copilot Chat &amp; Voice, to reviewing and fixing code, to full-stack app creation with GitHub Spark. Today, GitHub Copilot is the leader of the most successful and thriving market in the age of AI, with over 20 million users and counting. We did this by innovating ahead of the curve and showing grit and determination when challenged by the disruptors in our space. In just the last year, GitHub Copilot became the first multi-model solution at Microsoft, in partnership with Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI. We enabled Copilot Free for millions and introduced the synchronous agent mode in VS Code as well as the asynchronous coding agent native to GitHub.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Because of your relentless work, GitHub Copilot has introduced the greatest change to software development since the advent of the personal computer.</strong></p>



<p>While I’m certainly proud of our hard-earned business growth, technology built for its own sake means nothing but vanity unless it serves a greater purpose. We only succeed when the world succeeds, too. By launching this new age of developer AI, we’ve made it possible for anyone — no matter what language they speak at home or how fluent they are in programming — to take their spark of creativity and transform it into something real. I am more convinced than ever that the world will soon see one billion developers enabled by billions of AI agents, each imprinting human ingenuity into a new gold rush of software. When that day comes, we’ll know where the path began: with GitHub.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you, Hubbers. Being your colleague and your leader has been a great honor and I will cherish our many beautiful moments. Together, we’ve bent the arc of technology for the better.</p>



<p>So long, and thanks for all the fish,</p>
