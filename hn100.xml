<p>GOG's version goes a bit beyond the classic versions that were on sale on Blizzard.net. Beyond the broad promise that "this is the best version of this game you can buy on any PC platform," GOG has made specific tweaks to the networking code for <em>Warcraft I</em>&nbsp;and fixed up the DirectX wrapper for&nbsp;<em>Warcraft II</em> to improve its scaling on modern monitor resolutions.</p>
<p>It's quite a novel commitment, keeping non-revenue-generating games playable for buyers, even after a publisher no longer makes them available for sale. The&nbsp;Warcraft titles certainly won't be the only games for which publisher enthusiasm lags behind GOG and its classic gamers.</p>
<p>As noted at the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/gogs-preservation-program-is-the-drm-free-store-refocusing-on-the-classics/">Preservation Program's launch</a>, for some titles, GOG does not have the rights to modify a game's build, and only its original developers can do so. So if GOG can't make it work in, say, <a href="https://www.dosbox.com/">DOSBox</a>, extraordinary efforts may be required.</p>

<p>Beyond being tied to Blizzard's Battle.net service in perpetuity, there are other reasons&nbsp;<em>Warcraft </em>fans might want to hold onto the originals. Blizzard's 2020 release of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/warcraft-iii-reforged-not-the-flavor-of-chaos-we-were-hoping-for/"><em>Warcraft III Reforged</em></a> was widely panned as uneven, unfinished, and in some ways unfair, as it, too, removed the original&nbsp;<em>Warcraft III </em>from stores.&nbsp;<em>Reforged</em> was still in rough shape a year later, leading <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/warcraft-iii-reforged-tops-our-list-of-2020s-most-disappointing-video-games/">Ars' list of 2020's most disappointing games</a>. A 2.0 update promised a total reboot, but fans remain torn on the new art styles and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-says-warcraft-3-reforged-20-is-a-fresh-start-but-fans-remain-unconvinced-after-rocky-launch">are somewhat wary</a>.</p>
<p>Then again, you can now select more units in the first two&nbsp;<em>Warcraft</em> games' remasters, and you get "numerous visual updates for the UI."</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/raspberry-pi-boosts-pi-5-performance-sdram-tuning">https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/raspberry-pi-boosts-pi-5-performance-sdram-tuning</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42303111">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Raspberry Pi engineers tweaked SDRAM timings and other memory settings on the Pi, resulting in a 10-20% speed boost at the default 2.4 GHz clock. I of course had to test overclocking, which got me a <em>32%</em> speedup at 3.2 GHz! Changes may roll out in a firmware update for all Pi 5 and Pi 4 users soon.</p>

<p><img width="700" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/pi-5-overclock-desk-mess.jpeg" alt="Raspberry Pi 5 with SDRAM tweaks applied on desk"></p>

<p>My quest for the <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/search?dir=desc&amp;q=Raspberry+Pi+5+Model+B&amp;sort=score">world record Geekbench 6 score on a Pi 5</a> continues, as a couple months ago <a href="https://www.martinrowan.co.uk/2024/09/raspberry-pi-5-overclocking-to-beat-geekbench-record/">Martin Rowan</a> used cooling and <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/numa-emulation-speeds-pi-5-and-other-improvements">NUMA emulation tricks</a> to beat my then-record score.</p>

<p>But Raspberry Pi's engineers are <a href="https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=378276">tweaking memory timings even further</a>. They've talked to Micron and implemented a number of small tweaks that—along with NUMA emulation—really add up to a performance improvement for multi-core workloads. And even a little improvement for single-core!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sdram refresh interval is currently using the default data sheet settings. You can actually monitor the temperature of the sdram and it reports if refresh at half or quarter the rate can be done. That allows the overhead due to refresh to be reduced by a half or a quarter which does improve benchmark results.</p>
  
  <p>We got in contact with Micron, and there is good news. They have said they actually test their 8GB sdram with the 4GB refresh rate timing (rather than the slower jedec timings), and so it was be safe to run the 8GB parts with 4GB timing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The tweaks can also give the Pi 4 a boost, but the Pi 5 improves more dramatically:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pi 5 also has faster sdram, better access to sdram (i.e. wider/faster internal buses), so generally the improvements with NUMA are greater.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>SDRAM Tweaks</h2>

<p>To get the latest RAM speedups <em>for now</em> (this may be default soon):</p>

<ol>
<li>Update the Pi's firmware to the latest version: <code>sudo rpi-update</code> (confirm with <code>Y</code>)</li>
<li>Edit the bootloader config: <code>sudo rpi-eeprom-config -e</code></li>
<li>Add the configuration <code>SDRAM_BANKLOW=1</code> (for Pi 5... for Pi 4, use <code>3</code>)</li>
<li>Reboot</li>
</ol>

<h2>NUMA Emulation</h2>

<p>Since my <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/numa-emulation-speeds-pi-5-and-other-improvements">first post on NUMA emulation on the Pi 5</a>, the patches required have been added to Raspberry Pi's OS kernel.</p>

<p>So to use NUMA, all you have to do is make sure you're on the latest Pi OS (e.g. <code>sudo apt full-upgrade</code>).</p>

<p>To check if NUMA emulation is working, run <code>dmesg | grep NUMA</code> and make sure it says something like <code>mempolicy: NUMA default policy overridden to 'interleave:0-7'</code>. You can tweak the settings if you want by adding <code>numa=fake=[n]</code> inside <code>/boot/firmware/cmdline.txt</code>, though the defaults <em>should</em> be appropriate for most use cases.</p>

<h2>Overclocking</h2>

<p>Following my own guide for <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/overclocking-and-underclocking-raspberry-pi-5">overclocking the Pi 5</a>, I set the following inside <code>/boot/firmware/config.txt</code>:</p>

<pre><code>over_voltage_delta=72000
arm_freq=3200
gpu_freq=1000
</code></pre>

<p>After rebooting, I set the fan to 100%, <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/pi-overvolt">hacked the kernel with my pi-overvolt project</a> to boost the core voltage, and set the scaling governor to <code>performance</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ pinctrl FAN_PWM op dl
$ cd pi-overvolt &amp;&amp; sudo ./removelimit &amp;&amp; vcgencmd cache_flush
$ echo performance | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
</code></pre>

<h2>Geekbench World Record, Part 2</h2>

<p>With just the default firmware changes, my Geekbench scores already increase quite a bit (+8% single, +18% multi). Adding a 3.2 GHz overclock on top (using my <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/pi-overvolt">pi-overvolt</a> hack to boost voltages), those increases go to +32% single, +31% multi, resulting in yet <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/search?dir=desc&amp;q=Raspberry+Pi+5+Model+B&amp;sort=score">another world-record Geekbench 6 score</a>!</p>

</table>

<p>I also ran these tests with just an <a href="https://amzn.to/3OAkUo7">Argon THRML 30-AC Active Cooler</a>. To try to keep temps under control, I boosted the fan speed to 100%: <code>pinctrl FAN_PWM op dl</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>A word on overclocking</strong>: I've now overclocked around 20 Pi 5s, and found most to be capable of 2.6 or 2.8 GHz, and many (about half) to be capable of 3.0 GHz. But beyond that, very few can hit 3.1 GHz or beyond. More exotic overclocking (to 3.4 or 3.5 GHz) is much more difficult, and I've only had <em>one</em> Pi 5 that even boots reliably at those speeds, with more extensive cooling. RAM timings were already not happy at those speeds, and with the extra SDRAM tweaks, I imagine extreme overclocking will be even <em>more</em> unstable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>These optimizations could become default soon. I started looking into this after someone on Twitter mentioned seeing <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/search?page=2&amp;q=raspberry+500">Pi 500 Geekbench results</a> starting in September—all seemingly with these tweaks in place already!</p>

<p>Memory speed has been a thorn in the Pi 5's side in comparison to many RK3588 boards. It's nice to see the SDRAM tweaks giving it a significant speed boost, over a year post-launch.</p>

<p>And eagle-eyed readers may note I only overclocked to 3.2 GHz instead of 3.4 GHz this time. I'll leave the door open for someone else to combine all the above tricks to hit another new WR score ;)</p></div></div>]]></description>

But in 2021 we had recently moved to Denmark, so I had no professional network and didn’t speak the language, and Rebecka had just been born, and we needed the money—so I couldn’t be picky.</p><p>I also felt that the place had, as real estate agents say, “good bones”: it was beautiful, they had 6 exhibition halls, and it was a 25-minute bike ride from home.</p><p>For most of my career, I have worked short gigs or at projects that I started—the longest stretch I’ve been employed was, I think, 4 months at a bio lab when I was 19. No, that’s not right; I worked 8 months in a school when I was going down a rabbit hole about education in 2016/17. My working model has been that being employed kind of sucks. But this time, since I knew I couldn’t afford to quit anytime soon with the baby and all, I figured I could try treating it like one of my projects. So instead of selling coffee, I looked into how we could streamline the café and the cash register so that the volunteers who help out at the gallery felt comfortable doing my job, then I made myself a small office where I sat down to analyze the business and figure out how to improve it. You can imagine how popular this was. I had to backtrack for a few months after the board told me to get back to the café. And this was a good lesson for someone who is used to being self-employed: at an institution, you can’t just do what is best, you also have to build trust and coordinate with others so you are on the same page. This, however, doesn’t mean that you should abdicate your judgment and get in line.</p><p><span>I like the approach </span><a href="https://arc.net/l/quote/qiikxitd" rel="">Sholto Douglas expressed</a><span> in his interview with Dwarkesh Patel:</span></p><blockquote><p>If I’m trying to write some code and something isn't working, even if it’s in another part of the code base, I’ll often just go in and fix that thing or at least hack it together to be able to get results. [...] I think that's arguably the most important quality in almost anything. It's just pursuing it to the end of the earth. Whatever you need to do to make it happen, you'll make it happen. [...] I’m just going to vertically solve the entire thing. And that turns out to be remarkably effective.</p></blockquote><p><span>Ie. you don’t say, “This is my job and that thing is outside my area”—no, if the value you are trying to promote requires you to go outside your role and learn new skills and politick to get the authority to go ahead: then that </span><em>is</em><span> your job.</span></p><p>I’m not at the level of Sholto Douglas, but I figured I could at least try. So I made an agreement with my boss, who liked me, that she would let me sit in on the board meetings, and I began mapping out who was who and what they wanted and made sure to talk to all stakeholders when they passed through the gallery, and in 6 months I had a good enough model of what their values and goals were so I could align myself to the mission and make legible to them what I was doing. As my boss learned to trust me, she began to say that my role was “do whatever you think is right,” and eventually, after about a year, “. . . and you work whenever you feel like it.” (It helped that the year I started was the inflection point when the revenue, which had been shrinking or muddling for 5 years, began growing again; this wasn’t all my work, but it made my boss trust me.)</p><p>For the last 2.5 years I’ve mostly set my own agenda, and I’ve worked in uneven sprints and bursts, sometimes doing 70-hour weeks (my contract was 20 hours per week), and sometimes staying home for 10 days to write essays. This bursty way of working fits my temperament well, and I’ve genuinely loved this job in a way I didn’t think I’d ever love a job.</p><p>A bunch of my friends envied my role. But no one else applied.</p><p>I’ve worked with . . . ~150 artists from 33 countries. Quite a few of them have been the way artists are typically portrayed: self-centered, hard to work with, a little crazy. These were the amateurs. The best artists I’ve worked with, for example A and B, a husband and wife duo, were not at all like that. Let me give an example.</p><p>My boss fundraised and sold a large public sculpture A and B had made earlier this year. The day before we were going to install it, A and B came to the gallery and explained that they had found a better electronic component. Not that the old one was bad—it was the best one they had been able to find when they originally made the sculpture. But the new one was a little bit better. So then they proceeded to dismantle the entire sculpture, get their welding kit, and work for seven hours improving the sculpture. Notice three things:</p><ol><li><p>A and B had already been paid and the buyer was more than happy.</p></li><li><p>A and B didn’t tell the customer that they had spent 14 man hours improving it; it was just something they did because it was right, nothing they wanted credit for.</p></li><li><p>A and B have earned enough money from their New York gallerist to retire, but they’d rather use that money to make better art.</p></li></ol><p>It is this kind of attitude that makes someone succeed at their level, as far as I can tell. They are always pushing themselves to the edge, which makes them grow, and they are so selfless and pleasant to work with that you just want to do more stuff with them all the time. And you need that attitude to do anything ambitious: you need support, and funding, and goodwill, and you don’t get that by being disorganized or self-centered. Maybe at the very top of the art world artists can afford to be annoying again, I don’t know.</p><p>This is sort of a corollary to the above. When we work with artists like A and B, they answer their emails within the hour and they never complain when we can’t meet an expectation they have and when they come in they work hard and fast and deliver a great exhibition in a few hours. Certain other artists are more like, “oh, I don’t know what I want to do . . .” “can you get me more funding?” “that scratch on the floor makes my art look bad, you need to fix it” “can you build a wall there?” “no that wall wasn’t right after all, can you take it down” and after weeks of this you end up with something mediocre.</p><p>I got to run something like an experiment on my capacity to predict which exhibitions would end up great, and which would be a waste of time. It was easy. As soon as someone was slow at answering their email, or complained, or wanted us to be their therapist as they worked through the creative worries, I would tell my boss, “I think we should cancel this.” And my boss—whose strength and weakness is that she thinks the best of people and makes everyone feel held—would say, “Ah, but they are just a bit sloppy with email” “if we just fix this thing it will be fine. . .”&nbsp;</p><p>I was right every time; it ended in pain.</p><p>And this is quite nice actually: it means it doesn’t take some Tyler Cowen-level taste in talent to figure out who will do good work. I had limited experience with artists. But it turns out that if you are just a bit patient and say, “No, I’m not going to work with anyone who is demanding or confused or slow at answering their email”—then you are basically home.</p><p>And when you work like that, when you are patient for the right opportunities, you don’t have to do a lot of work at all. You just go around talking to people until you find a good match...and then the work sort of does itself with little effort. Very convenient!</p><p>It is not that I’m some grumpy person who thinks that some people are great and others aren’t, in some predetermined way—I think you can to a large extent decide which kind you want to be. But if someone else isn’t measuring up, I have no idea how to convince them to do so. So I look for people who have already decided.</p><p>An art gallery—especially a co-op art gallery with a non-profit board like the one I worked at—is a strange kind of business. The aim is not to earn money but to create beauty and strengthen the community and all of these other hard-to-measure things. Because of this, the gallery attracted people who prefer to think about higher values, rather than stuff like economic growth, which was seen as icky.</p><p>I am very much in that direction myself; I found it, for example, almost shameful to turn on paid subscriptions on my blog.</p><p>But something that became clear to me at the gallery, and from working with people like A and B who did art at a high level, is that you simply can’t afford to do good stuff if you don’t figure out the funding part.</p><p>Our elevator at the gallery, for example, was falling apart, and it would be illegal for us to keep open without one, which meant that we would be unable to do anything if we couldn’t get the money for the elevator—no community, no art, no nothing. My first boss and the board had not realized this, and when I pointed this out, there was a vague feeling that if this happened “the municipality should pay for it because art is so important.”</p><p><span>But the municipality on our island is in bad economic shape, and is considering cutting back on care for the elderly to balance their budget—so, to me, it feels unethical to angle for more money for the arts.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-151598106" href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/art-gallery#footnote-1-151598106" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> This is the kind of topic that makes me pound the table in fervor as I talk about it; I have often given this sermon to art students. We have a duty to our values and a duty to our community, and we can’t shy away from that because it feels hard, or because we want to be seen in a certain way, and then expect others to bail us out! We should shoulder our responsibility and figure out a way to make the art (or whatever we value) so attractive and meaningful that people feel good about funding it by becoming members or buying art or coffee or whatever.</span></p><p>If we want to make the world a better place, we can’t just think about the lofty stuff: we have to get our hands dirty and make sure the economic engine works.</p><p>It is not unreasonable to feel icky about the business side of art because the incentives of the market (and the grantmakers . . .) often really do pull in directions that actively threaten the very values that we care about. Yes.</p><p>But that is only a rough approximation of the truth.</p><p>If you take the time to actually bang your head against reality and figure out how to fund something, you will discover that there are places in the incentive landscape where the incentives (which are really the desires and needs of other human beings) align with your ineffable values. If you want to bring as much of what you have to give into the world, it is our job to figure out where in the incentive landscape that is.</p><p>I think of it as two vector fields:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56929dd5-9453-4136-b3fb-b60d0c179e7e_702x1075.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56929dd5-9453-4136-b3fb-b60d0c179e7e_702x1075.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56929dd5-9453-4136-b3fb-b60d0c179e7e_702x1075.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56929dd5-9453-4136-b3fb-b60d0c179e7e_702x1075.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56929dd5-9453-4136-b3fb-b60d0c179e7e_702x1075.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56929dd5-9453-4136-b3fb-b60d0c179e7e_702x1075.jpeg" width="702" height="1075" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/56929dd5-9453-4136-b3fb-b60d0c179e7e_702x1075.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1075,&quot;width&quot;:702,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56929dd5-9453-4136-b3fb-b60d0c179e7e_702x1075.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56929dd5-9453-4136-b3fb-b60d0c179e7e_702x1075.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56929dd5-9453-4136-b3fb-b60d0c179e7e_702x1075.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F56929dd5-9453-4136-b3fb-b60d0c179e7e_702x1075.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The first vector field is our artistic impulses, and ethics, and curiosity, and so on—all the things that we want to express in our lives (or in our institutions). The other vector field is the market. If you put these vector fields on top of each other and add the vectors together, you find that in most places, the vectors point in different directions which makes them pull each other off course. Ie. it is harder to make money if you also want to honor your curiosity; and, inversely, it is easy to lose contact with your values if you are also trying to earn money.</p><p>But if you are patient enough, and open-minded enough, and willing to work hard, you can iterate your way to parts where the vectors align.

They are able to keep track of their values and be attuned to themselves, and at the same time be cold-headed about how the world works: not shaping themselves to fit the world, but figuring out how to position what they do so that it becomes possible.</p><p>As someone who has been self-employed for most of my life, I have often looked at institutions and felt, “How come they are so slow and bad at their jobs? How hard can it be?” But since I had limited experience, I figured that there was something hard about it that I was too naive to see.</p><p><span>I’m no longer sure I was naive. It was, at the gallery at least, very easy to do much (~3x) better than baseline. For example: when I first came on the board, they would talk about the “three legs” of the gallery: fundraising, workshops, and sales (café, shop, tickets). But when I sneaked away to look at the numbers, two of these “sources of income” were actually cost centers: fundraising and workshops cost us more than we earned.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-151598106" href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/art-gallery#footnote-2-151598106" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> No one had looked at our bookkeeping to figure out how we earned our income! Also, they hadn’t factored in building maintenance costs, and when you did that it was clear that the current strategy would bankrupt us in 2-3 years.</span></p><p><span>These are not hard things to look up; I’m a very amateurish accountant.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-151598106" href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/art-gallery#footnote-3-151598106" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span><span> It is surprising how much edge “let me google that” gives you, 26 years after Google was released. (Not to talk about LLMs.) Most people just seem to come up with an answer in their head and then go with that without checking.</span></p><p>To the credit of the board, they did see the problem as soon as I pointed it out, and acted swiftly, and were able to find solutions that I was too inexperienced to find.</p><p>When we cut back on workshops and fundraising and focused on the parts that worked, we could do that with more care—running experiments, updating our pricing strategies, automating, streamlining, changing the branding, etc—which, as always when you narrow your focus, made a big difference, and we ended up growing revenue by 311 percent.</p><p>Now the expensive maintenance is either done or scheduled to be done, and we’ve built up a war chest, and we’ve set up a strong board, so I feel confident that the place can live on for another ten years—which was the goal I had. I feel ready to get back to my own projects.</p><p>In August, King Frederik X, the new Danish King, made an official visit to the gallery during his first tour. Since I’m not in the least a royalist, I was surprised at how sentimental the event made me—seeing him do his weird kingly walk as the preschoolers waved their flags in front of the gallery. I guess it made me feel like I belonged here, and that this country that has given us refuge told us that we were one of them now, that they saw the work we had done to care for this small corner of the whole. It felt like the end of one of the movies of my life, and above my desk as I write this, I keep, as a memento for my years at the gallery, a framed receipt for a sculpture I sold Queen Mary. That was fun.</p><p><em>Since this blog is my only income now, I want to remind you that you can become a paid subscriber if you want to read more or support the production of free essays.</em></p><p><em><span>I project that I will be able to earn a normal Danish middle-class income from the blog in a year or two if we can pull through; right now, however, support can make a genuine difference for us.

<p>I’ve been using Haskell in production for 8 years. I’ve been using OCaml in production for 8 months.</p>
<p>It’s time to compare those two languages.</p>
<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>
<p>Haskell probably has the most elegant syntax across all languages I’ve seen (maybe Idris is better because dependently typed code can become ugly in Haskell really quickly).</p>
<p>There’s utter joy in expressing your ideas by typing as few characters as possible.</p>
<p>OCaml, being a language from the ML family is great too, but still, Haskell is more tacit.</p>

<p>The above are just a few random code snippets. They don’t give an idea of all possible programs that could be written in those languages. But I hope they can quickly highlight the similarities and differences between the two languages.</p>
<p>This slowly leads us to the next point.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>Haskell has waaaaaay more features than probably any other programming language (well, C++ can compete). This is both good and bad.</p>
<p>It’s good because you have the tools to solve your problems in the best way.</p>
<p>It’s bad because you have those tools. They’re distracting. Every time I need to solve a problem in Haskell, I’m immediately thinking about all the ways I can design the solution instead of, ahem, actually implementing this solution.</p>
<p>I’m interested in building stuff, not sitting near my pond on a warm summer day, thinking if TypeFamilies + DataKinds would be better than GADTs for making illegal states unrepresentable.</p>
<p>If I come to an existing OCaml project, the worst thing previous developers could do to it is have poor variable names, minimal documentation, and 200+ LOC functions. That’s fine, nothing extraordinary, I can handle that.</p>
<p>If I come to an existing Haskell project, the worst thing previous developers could do… Well, my previous 8 years of Haskell experience can’t prepare me for that 😅</p>
<p>That’s why I feel more productive in OCaml.</p>
<p>I do miss some Haskell features at times. But I’ve seen their ugly side and what they can do to your output.</p>
<p>Consider the following table with a full comparison of major features.</p>

<h2 id="ecosystem">Ecosystem</h2>
<p>Let’s be honest, both programming languages are niche FP langs. So you shouldn’t expect first-class support for the latest modern framework that just got published.</p>
<p>However, in my experience, despite needing to write more custom bindings, you have solutions for the majority of common tasks.</p>
<p>For example, in OCaml, you can find:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dmbaturin/otoml/">otoml: A TOML parser</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/leostera/minttea">Mint Tea: A TUI framework</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/imandra-ai/ocaml-opentelemetry">ocaml-opentelemetry: Instrumentation for OpenTelemetry</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/solvuu/awsm">awsm: OCaml AWS Client</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/gopiandcode/petrol">petrol: An OCaml SQL API made to go FAST</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And so on. Similar story for Haskell.</p>
<p>I’d still say that the Haskell ecosystem has more packages and more ready-to-go solutions.</p>
<p>It’s easy to show the difference in the following example.</p>
<p>Number of <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api">Stripe API</a> client libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Haskell: 13</li>
<li>OCaml: 1 (last change was 8 years ago, so it’s more like zero)</li>
</ul>
<p>You may find a solution in Haskell. But often you’ll discover <strong>too many</strong> solutions, you won’t know which one to choose.</p>
<p>Choosing a library in Haskell becomes a separate skill you need to master. Haskellers <a href="https://www.haskellforall.com/2018/05/how-i-evaluate-haskell-packages.html">even blog their recommendations</a> on how to choose a library! And you’ll face this dilemma over and over again.</p>
<p>Often, a new Haskell library is created not because it solves a different problem.</p>
<p>But because the author wanted to <em>write it differently</em> (using different abstractions, playing with new features, etc. Who doesn’t want a new streaming library based on LinearTypes???).</p>
<p>It’s not exciting to write a GitHub API client and parse tons of JSON.</p>
<p>But it is exciting to design a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elqPlMyryjc">logger with comonads</a>.</p>

<p>The Haskell tooling evokes the most controversial feelings. It’s like an emotional roller coaster:</p>
<ul>
<li>🤩 Hoogle is the best! I can search through the entire ecosystem by using just a type signature!!!</li>
<li>😨 Wait, why build tooling error messages are so bad, what do you mean it couldn’t find a build plan for a working project???</li>
<li>🤩 Global content-addressable storage for all dependencies is such an amazing idea!!!</li>
<li>😨 What do you mean I need to recompile my IDE because I changed my package???</li>
<li>🤩 I can automatically test all the code snippets in my package docs!!!</li>
<li>😨 Wait, why the standard library doesn’t have docs at all for this version I use???</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on.</p>
<p>Using Haskell tooling is like always being in the quantum superposition of <strong>“How do you even use other PLs without such wholesome Haskell tools???”</strong> and <strong>“How Haskellers can live like that without these usability essentials???”</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>OCaml, on the other hand, hits differently. Because its ecosystem is smaller, you actually get surprised every time you find something working!</p>
<p>For example, the VSCode plugin for OCaml based on Language Server Protocol (LSP) works out-of-the-box. I never had any issues with it. It <strong>just works</strong> ™️</p>
<p>The ergonomics of starting with OCaml tooling might not be the best but they’re straightforward and robust. And they work most of the time.</p>
<hr>
<p>To get a full picture, refer to the following table for the full comparison of available tooling in both languages.</p>

<h2 id="compiler-messages">Compiler messages</h2>
<p>I want to highlight the compiler aspect of tooling separately since this is the tool you interact the most with.</p>
<p>Especially, compiler suggestions.</p>
<p>When using FP languages, the compiler is your best friend! You rely on it heavily to understand why your assumptions haven’t been codified precisely.</p>
<p>Therefore, the compiler must present the information in the most accessible way.</p>
<p>In my view, Haskell compiler messages tend to be verbose with lots of contextual, often redundant, and distracting information.</p>
<p>OCaml compiler messages, on the other hand, are quite succinct. Sometimes too succinct.</p>
<p>Consider the following example.</p>
<h2 id="haskell-compiler-messages-example">Haskell: Compiler messages example</h2>
<p><strong>Program with an error</strong></p>

<p><strong>Compiler output</strong></p>
<figure>
<img src="https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kh45ype7j5lo9gns76d7.png" alt=""><figcaption>Haskell Compiler Error Message</figcaption>

</figure>
<hr>
<p>This is just one example (and most likely not the best one), but you can already see the differences in how information is presented and how types work in different languages.</p>
<h2 id="standard-library">Standard library</h2>
<p>I believe the standard library deserves a separate mention too.</p>
<p>It shapes your first program in a language and guides you through all future journeys.</p>
<p>A great standard library is a cornerstone of your PL success.</p>
<p>A poor standard library is a cornerstone of never-ending bikesheds about a better standard library (including an endless variety of alternative competing standard libraries).</p>
<p>I’m a big proponent of the idea that a standard library should be batteries-included.</p>
<p>Give me an Option-like type, a UTF-8 string, Map and HashMap, JSON and XML parsers, async primitives, and so on, so I can avoid learning your poor implementation of dependency tracking and build tooling. (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2018/03/build-systems.pdf">Build Systems a la Carte</a> is a thorough analysis of the space of dependency trackers and build tools.).</p>
<p>Both Haskell and OCaml have kinda barebones standard libraries. They have minor differences (e.g.&nbsp;Haskell doesn’t include Map and HashMap; OCaml doesn’t have non-empty lists and Bitraversable). But overall they’re similar in the spirit.</p>
<p>The Haskell standard library is called <code>base</code> and OCaml standard library is called.. well, it’s just “the standard library”.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base">base: The Haskell Standard Library</a></li>
<li><a href="https://v2.ocaml.org/api/index.html">OCaml: The standard library</a></li>
</ul>
<p>However, one difference is striking. The quality of Haskell documentation sometimes can amaze even a seasoned developer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Haskell has a few more nice features, like the ability to jump to sources from docs but I’ve been told such features are being cooked for OCaml too 👀</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Compare a few doc snippets for the List data type (one of the fundamental structures in FP):</p>

<hr>
<p>You may argue that the result of such functions is obvious, therefore there’s no need to write essays under each function.</p>
<p>I’m a fan of example-driven documentation, and I love seeing usage examples in docs! This immediately gives me an idea of how I can leverage the API in the best way.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I want to end this blog post by saying:</p>
<p><strong>Both languages came a long way to support real industrial needs.</strong></p>
<p>They’re still small compared to mainstream languages.</p>
<p>If you’re not critically dependent on the presence of some specific SDK, you can choose any and have lots of joy while coding your next app 🧡</p>
<p>However, I prefer OCaml nowadays because I feel that I can focus on actually building stuff with this language.</p>

<p><h3>New Features</h3><a id="user-content-new-features" aria-label="Permalink: New Features" href="#new-features"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Deterministic Log Replay</strong>: Copper can now replay a log through your code in a deterministic fashion ie. if your tasks are deterministic, it will always output the same output from the same input! See the balancebot-resim for example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Aligner Task <a href="https://github.com/copper-project/copper-rs/pull/114">#114</a>:</strong> Added an aligner task that synchronizes multiple inputs by aligning matching time windows, facilitating coordinated data processing. This is particularly useful for sensor fusion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>❗ <strong>Lifecycle Trait Removal <a href="https://github.com/copper-project/copper-rs/pull/115">#115</a>:</strong> Removed the lifecycle trait to simplify task implementation and decouple passed types, streamlining the codebase. To build a minimum task a user needed to implement one method from the CuTaskLifecycle trait (new) and at least the process method from they flavor of tasks. This was forcing the implementation of 2 mandatory traits which is not necessary or useful for the user. Now we moved all the lifecycle methods in the tasks trait to only have to implement 2 traits (the task and Freezable, the serialization of its state)</p>

<p><h2>Release Notes - v0.4.0 - 2024-10-29</h2><a id="user-content-release-notes---v040---2024-10-29" aria-label="Permalink: Release Notes - v0.4.0 - 2024-10-29" href="#release-notes---v040---2024-10-29"></a></p>
<p><h4>New Features</h4><a id="user-content-new-features-2" aria-label="Permalink: New Features" href="#new-features-2"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Simulation API Support</strong>: With sim-mode=true in the main Copper macro, Copper will generate for you all the callbacks at all the tasks states it is going through (Start, Preprocess, Process, etc...). Combined with the already mockable Clock it allows a very easy integration with a virtual environment.</li>
<li>
<strong>BalanceBot Simulation <a href="https://github.com/copper-project/copper-rs/pull/69">#69</a>:</strong>  Built on that and leveraging Bevy and Avian3D for realistic motion dynamics, we made a little demo of our little real world demonstrator. The real world code and the sim code are 100% identical.</li>
<li>
<strong>Config Embedding <a href="https://github.com/copper-project/copper-rs/pull/78">#78</a>:</strong> Embedded the default <code>copperconfig.ron</code> directly into the Copper executable, simplifying deployment for the main case (just one executable to copy and that's it!!). If the file is present, it will take precedence over the embedded version. We also do log the actual config used in the logs so you can come back to it in doubt.</li>
</ul>
<p><h4>Enhancements</h4><a id="user-content-enhancements-2" aria-label="Permalink: Enhancements" href="#enhancements-2"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Cross-Platform Compatibility for Mocking <a href="https://github.com/copper-project/copper-rs/pull/75">#75</a>:</strong> Enhanced feature flags to better support various platforms, particularly macOS, enabling testing with mocked hardware dependencies. The full repo now compile under CI/CD on MacOS and Linux (previously it we could only compile and test the Core)</li>
</ul>
<p><h4>Bug Fixes</h4><a id="user-content-bug-fixes-2" aria-label="Permalink: Bug Fixes" href="#bug-fixes-2"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Terminal Restoration <a href="https://github.com/copper-project/copper-rs/pull/73">#73</a>:</strong> Fixed issues with terminal states not restoring properly upon exit, preventing corruption and enhancing the overall stability of simulator sessions.</li>
<li>
<strong>Print Output Cleanup <a href="https://github.com/copper-project/copper-rs/pull/80">#80</a>:</strong> Streamlined console logging to minimize redundant or unnecessary print statements, making debugging output more manageable.</li>
<li>
<strong>Git LFS Migration <a href="https://github.com/copper-project/copper-rs/pull/76">#76</a>:</strong> Moved heavy assets to a CDN to mitigate GitHub LFS limitations, reducing operational overhead and streamlining asset distribution.</li>
</ul>
<p><h4>Infrastructure and CI/CD</h4><a id="user-content-infrastructure-and-cicd" aria-label="Permalink: Infrastructure and CI/CD" href="#infrastructure-and-cicd"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Asset CDN Integration <a href="https://github.com/copper-project/copper-rs/pull/35">#35</a>:</strong> Transitioned assets to a content delivery network to avoid the super costly Github LFS.</li>
<li>
<strong>Improved Documentation <a href="https://github.com/copper-project/copper-rs/pull/82">#82</a>:</strong> Expanded and refined documentation across modules, enhancing clarity for new users and developers.</li>
</ul>
<p><h4>Internal Refactoring</h4><a id="user-content-internal-refactoring" aria-label="Permalink: Internal Refactoring" href="#internal-refactoring"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Logging Value Enhancements <a href="https://github.com/copper-project/copper-rs/pull/80">#80</a>:</strong> Fine-tuned value logging to increase logging granularity and simplify troubleshooting in complex simulation states.</li>
<li>
<strong>Feature Flag Revamp <a href="https://github.com/copper-project/copper-rs/pull/75">#75</a>:</strong> Restructured feature flags to better support debugging and cross-platform configurations, especially for macOS compatibility.</li>

<strong>Monitoring System</strong>: The monitoring framework is now fully integrated, allowing real-time stats collection and cumulative statistics (see PRs #49, #50, and #51). We can imagine complex decision trees happening at that stage for complex robots and various degraded modes.</li>

<p><h2>Copper - v0.2.3 - 2024-09-11</h2><a id="user-content-copper---v023---2024-09-11" aria-label="Permalink: Copper - v0.2.3 - 2024-09-11" href="#copper---v023---2024-09-11"></a></p>
<p>We are pleased to announce the release of Copper v0.2.3, which includes several new features, enhancements, and bug fixes. Below is a summary of the key changes in this release:</p>
<p><h4>New Features</h4><a id="user-content-new-features-4" aria-label="Permalink: New Features" href="#new-features-4"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>SN754410 Driver Support <a href="https://github.com/copper-project/copper-rs/pull/40">#40</a>:</strong> Added a new driver for the SN754410 motor driver. This driver allows easy integration with motor control applications, providing robust support for H-bridge motor control on a wide range of systems. <em>This driver is fully compatible with the BalanceHAT.</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>ADS7883 Driver <a href="https://github.com/copper-project/copper-rs/pull/39">#39</a>:</strong> Introduced a driver for the ADS7883, a 12-bit SPI ADC. This addition includes comprehensive documentation in the README to facilitate setup and integration. <em>The ADS7883 driver is also compatible with the BalanceHAT.</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p><h4>Enhancements</h4><a id="user-content-enhancements-4" aria-label="Permalink: Enhancements" href="#enhancements-4"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>macOS Development Support <a href="https://github.com/copper-project/copper-rs/pull/25">#25</a>:</strong> Copper can now be developed on macOS! The CI/CD pipeline has been updated to support macOS, ensuring cross-platform compatibility for all users.</li>
<li>
<strong>cu29_clock Enhancements <a href="https://github.com/copper-project/copper-rs/pull/32">#32</a>:</strong> Added a division feature to the cu29_clock, allowing more granular time management and synchronization within the Copper runtime.</li>
<li>
<strong>Structured Log Index File in Debug Mode <a href="https://github.com/copper-project/copper-rs/pull/30">#30</a>:</strong> Removed the requirement for an index file in debug mode within struct_log, simplifying the debugging process ie. only the config and the executable needs to be deployed for the debug build and you get a standard debug text logging.</li>
<li>
<strong>Logging Slabs Addition <a href="https://github.com/copper-project/copper-rs/pull/24">#24</a>:</strong> The current unified logger works with big memory mapped files. Initially we thought we could rely on the mmap resize feature of the kernel api but it just doesn't work. We are reverting into building "slabs", ie dividing the data logger into large files. Those files can be concatenated and read or directly read from the log exporter.</li>
</ul>
<p><h4>Bug Fixes</h4><a id="user-content-bug-fixes-4" aria-label="Permalink: Bug Fixes" href="#bug-fixes-4"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Compilation Feedback Adjustments <a href="https://github.com/copper-project/copper-rs/pull/33">#33</a>:</strong> Moved compilation feedback from standard output to standard error to better align with conventional logging practices.</li>
<li>
<strong>Flush and Core Dump Fixes <a href="https://github.com/copper-project/copper-rs/pull/29">#29</a>:</strong> Resolved issues where changes after a section flush could cause a core dump, improving the stability of the logging system.</li>
</ul>
<p><h4>Infrastructure and CI/CD</h4><a id="user-content-infrastructure-and-cicd-1" aria-label="Permalink: Infrastructure and CI/CD" href="#infrastructure-and-cicd-1"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>

<li>
<strong>Removed 'Continue on Error' in CI/CD <a href="https://github.com/copper-project/copper-rs/pull/36">#36</a>:</strong> Addressed a CI/CD issue where the pipeline was green while failing Oo.</li>
</ul>
<p><h4>Refactoring and Internal Changes</h4><a id="user-content-refactoring-and-internal-changes" aria-label="Permalink: Refactoring and Internal Changes" href="#refactoring-and-internal-changes"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Unified Logger Refactor <a href="https://github.com/copper-project/copper-rs/pull/27">#27</a>:</strong> Refactored the Unified Logger to introduce a dual-slab logging system, improving performance and eliminating the need for remap/resize operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Runtime Loop Enhancements <a href="https://github.com/copper-project/copper-rs/pull/21">#21</a>:</strong> Added a new notion of loops in the runtime plan, setting the stage for more flexible and powerful runtime behavior.</p>

            <pubDate>Mon, 02 Dec 2024 20:04:29 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://modal.com/blog/vprox">https://modal.com/blog/vprox</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42299829">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p data-svelte-h="svelte-3sbs4s">At Modal, we built a high-availability, Go-based VPN proxy called <em>vprox</em>.</p> <p>This is a deployment of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wireguard.com/">WireGuard</a>, so it operates
on Layer 3 (IP) of the network stack and allows us to funnel outbound traffic
from containers around the world through static IPv4 addresses. In the event of
a single-node failure, its static IPs are associated with other proxy nodes, and
containers reconnect within seconds.</p> <p> <img src="https://modal-cdn.com/vprox-blog-post/vprox-1.svg" alt="Map of Modal containers in different places funneling through a static IP proxy with WireGuard tunnels"> </p> <p>This blog post is about the guts of our network infrastructure, which powers
<a href="https://modal.com/docs/guide/proxy-ips">Static IP Proxies</a>.</p> <h2 id="scenario" data-svelte-h="svelte-15axy86">Scenario</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-15b9ky8">The year is 2024, and you are deciding on a serverless cloud platform. You
stumble upon Modal. Run <code>pip install modal</code>, write a short Python function, and
<code>modal deploy</code> it. Amazing, now you’ve got a cron job and API endpoint in the
cloud, within seconds.</p>  <p>Modal functions run on hardware around the world, in
<a href="https://modal.com/blog/region-selection-launch">dozens of regions</a> across multiple cloud
providers. This is how we optimize the prices on your compute and scale
dynamically to meet demand. It’s all to make developers happy, since now you
don’t have to think about this stuff. (We get it, we’re infrastructure
engineers.)</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-13b1bl8">But now let’s say you want to connect your serverless function to your MongoDB
cloud database, and it requires a specific IP access list. Uh oh…</p> <center data-svelte-h="svelte-jd7vgl"><img src="https://modal-cdn.com/cdnbot/tmpr5_wsi7u_2639b00c.webp" alt="Edit IP Access List Entry" width="600"></center> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-aezq97">Usually, with a traditional provider you’d deploy some VMs and assign them a
static IP address or two, then distribute them across your machines and add
those to your access list. So now your application runs on cloud hosts at some
particular IPs, like <code>20.21.20.21</code>. Only these machines can access your MongoDB
database, and no one else can around the world.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1vqftv1">But if you’re running a serverless computing workload, which can not only run in
any data center around the world, but also scale up and down… you won’t know
what IP address your code is running on! So that access list would have
thousands of entries and will be constantly changing, which really isn’t going
to cut it.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1lizj1k">Plus, Modal has an isolated container runtime that lets us share each host’s CPU
and memory between workloads. If a host has one IP, your container and
another customer’s container on that host would have the same IP, so that
bypasses the security of your access list.</p> <h2 id="okay-but-i-want-to-access-my-database-from-modal" data-svelte-h="svelte-3g7uaz">Okay but I want to access my database from Modal</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-118b262">So you need a static outbound IP address. Is that possible? Let’s break it down.
IP addresses act as identifiers for sending and receiving internet data. When
two different containers communicate with a web service like Google, each has a
unique source IP. This allows Google’s server to reply directly to the correct
container.</p> <p> <img src="https://modal-cdn.com/vprox-blog-post/vprox-2.svg" alt="Two containers, both sending data to a server, with different IPs"> </p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-n4o15x">In this standard setup, the outbound IP address is tightly coupled to the
container. How can you decouple static IP addresses from the actual compute
resources? There’s a solution for this: <strong>You use a proxy.</strong></p> <p>We started by adding <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS">SOCKS5</a> proxies to
Modal. SOCKS5 is an unsung hero of the Internet proxy world; it’s a technology
from 1996 (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1928">RFC 1928</a>) that lets
you send a request <em data-svelte-h="svelte-q4pvpt">through</em> another computer. SOCKS5 is secretly built into a
lot of software like OpenSSH, if you pass in the obscure <code data-svelte-h="svelte-hyyf4p">-D</code> flag that enables
the feature. But SOCKS5 doesn’t work out-of-the-box. You need to edit your
application to use an esoteric network shim.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1dp56pp">If you wanted containers running your function to use a SOCKS5-based Modal
Proxy, we would define one for your workspace. Once the Proxy object is created,
you can use it like so:</p>  <p data-svelte-h="svelte-coa8qv">Now other functions can call <code>get_user_count()</code> remotely as a serverless
invocation. The proxy is only spun up within the <code>get_user_count()</code> function.</p>  <p data-svelte-h="svelte-12yw1j5">Slick! But this is brittle. Replacing the standard library’s <code>socket.socket</code>
object doesn’t work for libraries that don’t use <code>socket</code> directly. And many
common libraries don’t, such as asyncpg, datadog, aiohttp, httpx, or grpcio.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1hwzmna">The broader issue is that the API is not obvious. It passes on the complexity to
the user, who needs to figure out how to wire up the SOCKS5 proxy to their
libraries. Modal is a cloud provider, and our philosophy on developer experience
is that things “just work” — we should implement features that are correct and
efficient by design.</p> <p>So we stepped down a layer. Since we own the entire runtime, how can we
configure networking so that <em data-svelte-h="svelte-9ary3k">all outbound Internet</em> <em data-svelte-h="svelte-1mjeabc">access</em> goes through that
IP? You should be able to just send a simple request to
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://ifconfig.me/">ifconfig.me</a> and get back your proxy’s IP, for instance.</p> <h2 id="enter-wireguard" data-svelte-h="svelte-1nd9c0t">Enter WireGuard</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-qzj7qn">At Layer 3, the Internet Protocol, all traffic looks the same—whether it’s
Wikipedia, YouTube, or MongoDB. It’s just MTU-sized packets, usually a few
kilobytes each, traveling through routers to their destinations. To ensure a
consistent source IP address for outbound internet traffic across multiple
containers, we can route all container traffic through a VPN. A VPN not only
encrypts traffic but also can mask its source IP address, achieving the desired
consistency.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1s32srq">WireGuard is a really simple VPN, and it’s included in the mainline Linux
kernel. So we just have to bootstrap a WireGuard network between the proxy
server and Modal workers (machines that run containers), configure traffic
routing, and we’re all set!</p> <p> <img src="https://modal-cdn.com/vprox-blog-post/vprox-3.svg" alt="Two containers sending data to a server, with a proxy in the middle"> </p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1r3j2pr">To set up the actual WireGuard network, we start an HTTPS listener on port 443
of the WireGuard server. This binds to the public IP of the proxy node, and it
takes “connect” POST requests to set up connections to the WireGuard network. We
can rely on the security of TLS to handle VPN key distribution.</p> <p>When a POST request is received with the client’s public key, the server
validates the credentials of the client, then allocates an IP in the subnet and
adds it as a peer at that IP. The server also has a loop that removes idle peers
after a few minutes of not receiving WireGuard handshakes. We use the
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/WireGuard/wgctrl-go">wgctrl</a> library for this, which
provides Go bindings for the WireGuard API, including access to the
<code data-svelte-h="svelte-1encs16">LastHandshakeTime</code> property of each peer.</p>  <p data-svelte-h="svelte-b0r7kw">On the client side, we periodically probe the WireGuard VPN connection every few
seconds. This is implemented by the <code>CheckConnection</code> function below. If the
pings fail, the client assumes that the connection is dead, and it then begins
trying to reconnect to the server and recover by sending a new “connect” POST
request.</p>  <p>This behavior is implemented in our open-source Go package
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/modal-labs/vprox">vprox</a>, which we’ll talk about more at the
end of this blog post.</p> <h2 id="policy-based-routing-on-container-traffic" data-svelte-h="svelte-i7tp1m">Policy-based routing on container traffic</h2> <p>There’s still a missing piece to the puzzle: Modal workers are multi-tenant. We
run gVisor sandboxes from multiple functions on the same host, which is what
lets us provide a serverless compute product with <a href="https://modal.com/pricing">flexible pricing</a>.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-dnrj5b">How does container networking work? Well, very briefly:</p> <ul><li>Each worker machine runs multiple containers, and each container gets its own
<em><a rel="nofollow" href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/network_namespaces.7.html">network namespace</a></em>.</li> <li data-svelte-h="svelte-adf55u">Inside the network namespace, the container has a <em>veth (virtual Ethernet)
interface</em>. This acts as a virtual network card, similar to the WiFi card on
your laptop.</li> <li>Veth’s come in pairs. The other half of the veth lives on a
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/10/22/introduction-to-linux-interfaces-for-virtual-networking#bridge">bridge device</a>
(like a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch">switch</a>).</li> <li>When containers send outbound packets to the Internet, they pass through the
veth and arrive at the bridge, where the host Linux kernel is configured to
<strong><a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation">masquerade</a>
each packet’s source IP address</strong> before exiting the machine.</li></ul> <p>If you didn’t get all that, it’s fine! The important part is the last step, IP
masquerade. This is a form of network address translation, or
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation">SNAT</a>. It’s just
like how your home router uses SNAT to make all devices in your house have the
same public IP address. Each cloud host at Modal uses SNAT so containers running
on that host appear to the outside world to have the host’s public IP.</p> <p> <img src="https://modal-cdn.com/vprox-blog-post/vprox-4.svg" alt="Multiple containers on a host behind a network bridge and masquerade rule"> </p> <p>This is the classic container networking setup. To introduce WireGuard, we need
to tell traffic from one container to go to a designated WireGuard interface
without affecting its neighbors. This requires an update to the kernel’s
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_table">routing table</a>. When a container
sends a packet to the outside world, we should inspect the packet’s source IP
and redirect it to the proper VPN interface based on the container’s metadata.</p> <p>But people familiar with Linux might see a problem here: the
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iproute2">iproute2</a> system in Linux doesn’t
actually let you put down routing table entries by source IP! In Linux, routing
tables are based on
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing">CIDR blocks</a> of
destination IPs. So you can route packets <em data-svelte-h="svelte-1wkmrfv">to</em> <code data-svelte-h="svelte-5wv3mt">142.251.40.174</code> (google.com)
from all containers, but you can’t tell packets <em data-svelte-h="svelte-yvfinu">from</em> a specific container to
go through a VPN.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-k4co4f">There’s a solution, but it means we need to sin a bit. We’re going to write some
<em>policy-based routing</em> rules. 🫢</p>  <p>Policy-based routing works by switching between multiple routing tables. The
routing tables in Linux are numbered from 1 to 2^31. So we can assign a routing
table to each container that requests a proxy, allocating indices to avoid
repeats, then
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ip-rule.8.html">edit the policy database</a>
so that traffic from that container goes through the routing table.</p> <p> <img src="https://modal-cdn.com/vprox-blog-post/vprox-5.svg" alt="Diagram of container traffic through a policy database and route table"> </p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1xhepix">We really <em>didn’t</em> want to do this, it’s tricky! For example, what happens if
two containers start up at the same time? They need to synchronize and decide
which one gets the next numbered routing table. And if a container crashes
early, it adds another kernel resource to clean up. Dynamically configuring the
policy database was not our first choice of solution.</p> <p>(Technical detail: As an alternative approach, we tried doing it in eBPF first
with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://docs.kernel.org/bpf/redirect.html"><code data-svelte-h="svelte-vmildm">xdp_redirect()</code></a> in our packet
filter attached to the container bridge device. But this didn’t work. It was
incompatible with SNAT because eBPF skips the Linux netfilter stack.)</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-bpoc2p">Luckily, our runtime is pretty resilient to unexpected crashes (it’s written in
safe Rust, with testing, monitoring and conscious async-oriented design), and
overall we haven’t run into any reliability issues with our implementation so
far.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-dt4uos">That concludes our worker-side implementation of the proxy! Now, back to the
server…</p> <h2 id="so-you-have-a-proxy-server-running-for-every-ip" data-svelte-h="svelte-eppjj4">So you have a proxy server running for every IP?</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-gb5fyl">We did initially! But starting one cloud VM for every proxy server is pretty
expensive, and it’s not very efficient on resource utilization. The entire point
of serverless is shared tenancy, after all. To make this faster and more
reliable, we started assigning multiple IPs to each proxy server, so that one
unit of shared hardware could manage all of these associations.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1ovxg7s">Each <code>vprox server</code> node has one or more IPs living on one or more network
interfaces. For example, on AWS, the latest <code>c7gn.8xlarge</code> instance type ($2.00
/ hr) with 100 Gigabit networking can have up to 8 network interfaces, with 30
IPv4 addresses per interface. This is a pretty good deal — at full packing of
240 IPs, each costs less than $0.01 / hr while also allowing for individual
proxies to burst up to 100 Gbps of shared bandwidth.</p> <p>To avoid contention and control the bandwidth used by different IP proxies on
the same server, we can use the
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/tc.8.html">tc traffic shaping system</a> in
Linux.</p> <h3 id="juggling-ips-between-servers" data-svelte-h="svelte-6rhytx">Juggling IPs between servers</h3> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-n2rfhb">We didn’t just stop there though. We wrote some code that hits the cloud
instance metadata endpoint and detects within a couple seconds if you made any
changes to the IP addresses associated with the instance. If you did, <code>vprox</code>
automatically reconfigures itself to reallocate blocks of WireGuard IPs, move
around connections, bootstrap WireGuard interfaces, and start accepting
connections from clients to the new IP address.</p> <p>This may seem like overengineering, but it reduces the amount of configuration
for <code data-svelte-h="svelte-133xquj">vprox</code> and makes the server significantly more flexible. Plus, it’s
fault-tolerant by design!
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2898444">Reconciliation loops</a> are the
hidden heroes of distributed systems, as we all know.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-v6gysk">When enabled, the network proxy is on the hot path of every request from a
serverless function, so high availability is crucial. You wouldn’t want your API
to start failing because you can’t connect to MongoDB anymore due to the <em>one</em>
proxy instance going down! So we implemented another reconciliation loop,
globally, that creates many servers and juggles the IPs around in event of a
termination.</p> <p> <img src="https://modal-cdn.com/vprox-blog-post/vprox-6.svg" alt="Failover of one proxy node causing IP reassignment"> </p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-120w2ex">This can happen if the compute instance becomes unhealthy or needs to be taken
down for maintenance for any reason. The <code>vprox</code> client is also designed to
detect network partitions by periodically sending pings, and when it detects
that it has disconnected, we can automatically recover the connection to the new
server in under 10 seconds.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-e7pm6o">Since IP is an inherently unreliable and unordered protocol, you’ll probably
never even notice if your proxy goes down! Even if you’re running an HTTP
request at that exact moment, it will just result in a few dropped packets,
which are automatically retried at the TCP layer. No database errors for you — a
perfect recovery.</p> <h3 id="what-is-rp_filter-anyway" data-svelte-h="svelte-1kqfb28">What is rp_filter anyway?</h3> <p>(We’re going to get into <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sysctl">sysctl</a> here.
Sysctl is a way to configure attributes of the Linux kernel. Think of it like an
OS-wide configuration file.)</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-kuqel1">When testing <code>vprox</code> on different distributions of Linux, we ran into a problem
that we had to debug. Specifically, it was tested to be working on Ubuntu 24.04,
but it didn’t seem to be working on Oracle Linux 9. What happened? WireGuard is
part of the kernel, and iptables / iproute2 are supported by both distributions,
so this should be cross-platform.</p> <p>The issue turned out to be caused by a feature called <em data-svelte-h="svelte-h1xfux">reverse path filtering</em>.
Basically, the sysctl
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://sysctl-explorer.net/net/ipv4/rp_filter/"><code data-svelte-h="svelte-bvzrnk">net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter</code></a>
controls whether IP packets received on an interface are dropped. If strict
filtering is set, Linux will drop packets whose source address doesn’t appear to
match the path in the routing table that would otherwise be used to send packets
to that destination.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1mynh39">Since we’re sending packets to all kinds of public Internet sources through
these WireGuard interfaces, when they return on the interface, the kernel isn’t
happy about their source IP and drops them. It detects that a more “direct” path
would be to go through the default interface on the host instead. We need to
relax rp_filter.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-gmy1dn">Curiously, when we disabled the rp_filter setting by setting it to 0, vprox
didn’t work. We had to explicitly set it to 2, which is “loose mode” that checks
the incoming packet against the kernel’s FIB (forwarding information bus).</p>  <p data-svelte-h="svelte-6q1f9f">Honestly, I don’t know why vprox only works when reverse path filtering is in
loose mode and not when it is disabled. But we switched the value of the sysctl,
and now it works reliably across Linux distributions.</p> <h2 id="using-vprox" data-svelte-h="svelte-1uk36qr">Using vprox</h2> <p>If you’re a developer on Modal, you can get access to our
<a href="https://modal.com/docs/guide/proxy-ips">static IP proxies</a> feature on the Team plan. Just create
a proxy and voilà, you’ve got an outbound IP. No SOCKS5 required!</p>  <p data-svelte-h="svelte-isox7e">Right now each Proxy corresponds to a single static IP address, but we’re
planning to extend this to region-specific proxies where your container may
automatically select an IP from the nearest geographic location to minimize
latency.</p> <p>But this blog post is about the internals, and as mentioned before, we
open-sourced our control plane — how we run WireGuard in production and
integrate it into the Modal serverless function runtime. You can find this in
the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/modal-labs/vprox">modal-labs/vprox</a> repository on
GitHub. With just a couple commands, you can run a VPN server and any number of
clients. All aspects of the networking are configurable.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1s8dxqa">A nice thing about this implementation is IP discovery. On AWS, we periodically
poll the instance metadata endpoint to find the IPs attached, so you don’t have
to update this manually. Just run <code>vprox server --cloud aws</code> and watch the magic
happen. (It should be easy to port this code to other cloud providers, but we’ve
only tried deploying on AWS ourselves.)</p> <hr> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-19au1nm">We’re excited to see how you use static IPs at Modal! This project has been fun
for many of us. I’m grateful to my coworker Luis Capelo for deploying vprox
in production, and to our intern Jeffrey Meng for implementing IP discovery and
client reconnection.</p> <p>If you’re interested in crafting reliable, secure systems at scale for the next

    <p data-block-key="h3lap">The successful application of machine learning to understand the behavior of complex real-world systems from healthcare to climate requires robust methods for processing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">time series</a> data. This type of data is made up of streams of values that change over time, and can represent topics as varied as a patient’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ECG</a> signal in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ICU</a> or a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/sustainability/weather-prediction-with-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storm system moving across the Earth</a>.</p><p data-block-key="djbhr">Highly capable multimodal foundation models, such as <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gemini Pro</a>, have recently burst onto the scene and are able to reason not only about text, like the large language models (LLMs) that preceded them, but also about other modalities of input, including images. These new models are powerful in their abilities to consume and understand different kinds of data for real-world use cases, such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18416v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demonstrating expert medical knowledge</a> or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11805" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">answering physics questions</a>, but haven’t yet been leveraged to make sense of time-series data at scale, despite the clear importance of this type of data. As chat interfaces mature generally across industries and data modalities, products will need the ability to interrogate time series data via natural language to meet user needs. When working with time series data, previous attempts to improve performance of LLMs have included <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15525" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sophisticated prompt tuning and engineering</a> or <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07773" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">training a domain specific encoder</a>.</p><p data-block-key="99bn3">Today we present work from our recent paper, “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02637" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plots Unlock Time-Series Understanding in Multimodal Models</a>”, in which we show that for multimodal models, much like for humans, it is easier to make sense of the data visually by looking at plots of the data rather than sifting through the raw time-series values themselves. Importantly, we show that this does not require any expensive additional training, and instead relies on the native multimodal capabilities of these foundation models. Compared to only using a text format for prompting a multimodal model, we demonstrate that using plots of the time series data can increase performance on classification tasks up to 120%.</p>

    </p>



    <p data-block-key="h3lap">We investigated the hypothesis that multimodal models understand time-series data better through their vision encoders than through the textual representation of long arrays of floating point numbers. We tested both synthetic tasks that we devised to allow us to probe specific types of reasoning, and real-world tasks that contain representatively noisy data whose analysis is important for advancing digital health. For each task we ran experiments using a <i>text method</i> and a <i>plot method</i> to prompt the model with the time-series data. The text method used the raw time-series data to create a series of numbers that were used directly to prompt the model. The plot method took the raw time-series data, created a visual plot of that data and then used an image of the plot to prompt the model. To show that this generalizes across different foundation models, we performed experiments on both small and large models of two best-of-class families of frontier models: <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gemini Pro 1.5</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPT4o</a>, and two smaller models <a href="https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/flash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gemini Flash 1.5</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-mini-advancing-cost-efficient-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPT4o-mini</a>.</p>

                <h3>Detecting falls</h3>
            
        
        
    </p>



    <p data-block-key="h3lap">One such task that we explored was using a publicly available <a href="https://www.frdr-dfdr.ca/repo/dataset/6998d4cd-bd13-4776-ae60-6d80221e0365" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) dataset</a> curated and labeled for fall detection, since <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1475-925X-12-66" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">falls are an important health risk</a>, especially amongst the older and more vulnerable people. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_measurement_unit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IMU sensors</a> report six dimensions of acceleration and angular velocity data sampled at over 100Hz and are commonly found in today's smartphones and smartwatches. In this task, we instruct the models to classify the sensor data into normal daily living without a fall, near falls, or actual falls. A <a href="https://pilotfeasibilitystudies.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40814-020-00748-1#:~:text=A%20near%2Dfall%20is%20defined,recovery%20manoeuvres%20are%20not%20executed." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">near fall</a> is characterized as a loss of balance that would result in a fall if sufficient balance recovery maneuvers are not executed. Identifying when a near fall is occurring is important, since older adults may not recognize it as one; <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003999309000860" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">near falls may also predict the risk of true falls</a>. This particular dataset was deliberately curated to include examples where the user had a near fall, such as a recovering from a slip without actually falling, making it more challenging to determine whether the user actually had a fall.</p><p data-block-key="945oe">This task was structured as a few-shot task, where the model was shown a number of IMU time-series examples for each outcome before being asked to classify an IMU time-series example that it had not seen before.</p>
</div>

                    
                    
    




                    
                    
    


<div>
        
  <p data-block-key="h3lap">Overall the plot method outperformed the text method on this task and, in general, improved as more few-shot examples were provided. This indicated that the models were able to extract additional information from the few-shot examples when they were presented as plots.</p>

    </div>

    <p>
        
            
                <h3>Recognizing physical activity</h3>
            
        
        
    </p>



    <p data-block-key="h3lap">We also used IMU data for a different task, in which we tested the models’ abilities to discriminate the type of physical activity being performed by a user between sitting, standing, using stairs, walking or biking. This kind of <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7742959" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">activity recognition is regularly used</a> in fitness and wellbeing products that users rely on to track and improve their physical health. The <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2809695.2809718" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publicly available dataset we used</a> was designed to collect IMU data from a variety of different devices such as phones and smartwatches, with this heterogeneity of data sources increasing the difficulty of the classification task.</p><p data-block-key="bemnk">We presented this as a few-shot prompt to the models and, like the fall detection task, we find that the plot-based approach outperforms the text-based method. Again increasing the number of few-shot examples generally increased the plot performance in most models.</p>
</div>

                <h2>Synthetic tasks</h2>
            
        
        
    </p>



    <p data-block-key="h3lap">Having shown that plots improve model performance in contexts that are relevant to digital health, we also investigated model performance in synthetic experiments of our own design. We did this to probe performance generally on tasks of increasing difficulty and reasoning sophistication, ranging from naming the pattern being plotted to multiple choice questions a university calculus student might encounter.</p><p data-block-key="18jce">The simplest synthetic task we used was functional form identification, where the model had to classify a series of data points into the type of underlying function that created it, such as a linear or quadratic. With this relatively simple task the median classification accuracy of the plot method was up to 120% better than the text method, indicating that when presented visually as a plot, the multimodal foundation models could more easily understand the overall trend and discern the underlying function than when they were just provided the raw data.</p>
</div>

                    
                    
    




                    
                    
    


<div>
        
  <p data-block-key="h3lap">A harder task involved synthetic data series where the data was clustered in 1 to 9 discrete clusters and the model was asked to count the number of clusters in the data. The plot method had a 55-85% lower mean absolute error than the text method.</p>

    </div>

                    
                    
    




                    
                    
    


<div>
        
  <p data-block-key="h3lap">Additional synthetic tasks we tested include classifying linear correlations and identifying derivatives, which also generally showed that the plot performance was better than, or at least as good as, the text performance.</p>

                <h3>The art of the chart</h3>
            
        
        
    </p>



    <p data-block-key="h3lap">Having shown that for time-series data, the reasoning power of these foundation models are best leveraged through plots, we also investigated whether the models preferred any specific style of plot. We tried many different aesthetic choices such as changing the color scheme, marker size and axis display, but in the end found that there wasn’t a strong dependence of the results on these choices.</p>

    </p>



    <p data-block-key="h3lap">Beyond the performance gain of the models ingesting plots over text, we also found that using plots made more efficient use of the limited context window of the models we studied. The fundamental reason for this is the mechanism in which multimodal models ingest either textual or visual information – when presented as numeric strings, time series data must be split into many granular tokens that the model ingests, while a plotted image is more efficiently represented with fewer tokens. As a result, plotting a time-series made more efficient use of available model context lengths, especially in cases where passing the full textual form of a time-series would generate more tokens than the model can ingest.</p><p data-block-key="3jcsh">We also found that the cost of reasoning about a plotted time-series could be up to 10x cheaper than reasoning about its textual representation, as model API cost increases with the number of input tokens.</p>

    </p>



    <p data-block-key="h3lap">Our results show that plotting as an approach amplifies the capabilities of multimodal models currently available to consumers to make sense of complicated time-series data. Our work sets the stage for increasing the power of tools and assistants powered by multimodal models to incorporate time-series data for end-user benefit.</p>

            The discovery that other vertebrates have healthy, microbial brains is fueling the still controversial possibility that we might have them as well.        </p>
        
    </div><div>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div data-role="selectable">
    <p>Bacteria are in, around and all over us. They thrive in almost every corner of the planet, from deep-sea hydrothermal vents to high up in the clouds, to the crevices of your ears, mouth, nose and gut. But scientists have long assumed that bacteria can’t survive in the human brain. The powerful blood-brain barrier, the thinking goes, keeps the organ mostly free from outside invaders. But are we sure that a healthy human brain doesn’t have a microbiome of its own?</p>
<p>Over the last decade, initial studies have presented conflicting evidence. The idea has remained controversial, given the difficulty of obtaining healthy, uncontaminated human brain tissue that could be used to study possible microbial inhabitants.</p>
<p>Recently, a study published in <em>Science Advances</em> provided the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.ado0277">strongest evidence yet</a> that a brain microbiome can and does exist in healthy vertebrates — fish, specifically. Researchers at the University of New Mexico discovered communities of bacteria thriving in salmon and trout brains. Many of the microbial species have special adaptations that allow them to survive in brain tissue, as well as techniques to cross <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-the-brain-protects-itself-from-blood-borne-threats-20230620/">the protective blood-brain barrier</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.colorado.edu/iphy/people/faculty/matthew-r-olm">Matthew Olm</a>, a physiologist who studies the human microbiome at the University of Colorado, Boulder and was not involved with the study, is “inherently skeptical” of the idea that populations of microbes could live in the brain, he said. But he found the new research convincing. “This is concrete evidence that brain microbiomes do exist in vertebrates,” he said. “And so the idea that humans have a brain microbiome is not outlandish.”</p>
<p>While fish physiology is, in many ways, similar to humans’, there are some key differences. Still, “it certainly puts another weight on the scale to think about whether this is relevant to mammals and us,” said <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/iphy/people/faculty/christopher-d-link">Christopher Link</a>, who studies the molecular basis of neurodegenerative disease at the University of Colorado, Boulder and was also not involved in the work.</p>

    <p>The human gut microbiome plays a critical role in the body, communicating with the brain and maintaining the immune system through <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/in-the-guts-second-brain-key-agents-of-health-emerge-20231121/">the gut-brain axis</a>. So it isn’t totally far-fetched to suggest that microbes could play an even larger role in our neurobiology.</p>
<h2><strong>Fishing for Microbes</strong></h2>
<p>For years, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/irenesalinasremiro/">Irene Salinas</a> has been fascinated by a simple physiological fact: The distance between the nose and the brain is quite small. The evolutionary immunologist, who works at the University of New Mexico, studies mucosal immune systems in fish to better understand how human versions of these systems, such as our intestinal lining and nasal cavity, work. The nose, she knows, is loaded with bacteria, and they’re “really, really close” to the brain — mere millimeters from the olfactory bulb, which processes smell. Salinas has always had a hunch that bacteria might be leaking from the nose into the olfactory bulb. After years of curiosity, she decided to confront her suspicion in her favorite model organisms: fish.</p>
<p>Salinas and her team started by extracting DNA from the olfactory bulbs of trout and salmon, some caught in the wild and some raised in her lab. They planned to look up the DNA sequences in a database to identify any microbial species.</p>
<p>These kinds of samples, however, are easily contaminated — by bacteria in the lab or from other parts of a fish’s body — which is why scientists have struggled to study this subject effectively. If they did find bacterial DNA in the olfactory bulb, they would have to convince themselves and other researchers that it truly originated in the brain.</p>

<p>To cover their bases, Salinas’ team studied the fishes’ whole-body microbiomes, too. They sampled the rest of the fishes’ brains, guts and blood; they even drained blood from the many capillaries of the brain to make sure that any bacteria they discovered resided in the brain tissue itself.</p>
<p>“We had to go back and redo [the experiments] many, many times just to be sure,” Salinas said. The project took five years — but even in the early days it was clear that the fish brains weren’t barren.</p>
<p>As Salinas expected, the olfactory bulb hosted some bacteria. But she was shocked to see that the rest of the brain had even more. “I thought the other parts of the brain wouldn’t have bacteria,” she said. “But it turned out that my hypothesis was wrong.” The fish brains hosted so much that it took only a few minutes to locate bacterial cells under a microscope. As an additional step, her team confirmed that the microbes were actively living in the brain; they weren’t dormant or dead.</p>
<p>Olm was impressed by their thorough approach. Salinas and her team circled “the same question, from all these different ways, using all these different methods — all of which produced convincing data that there actually are living microbes in the salmon brain,” he said.</p>
<p>But if there are, how did they get there?</p>
<h2><strong>Invading the Fortress</strong></h2>
<p>Researchers have long been skeptical that the brain could have a microbiome because all vertebrates, including fish, have <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-the-brain-protects-itself-from-blood-borne-threats-20230620/">a blood-brain barrier</a>. These blood vessels and surrounding brain cells are fortified to serve as gatekeepers that allow only some molecules in and out of the brain and keep invaders, especially larger ones like bacteria, out. So Salinas naturally wondered how the brains in her study had been colonized.</p>

<p>By comparing microbial DNA from the brain to that collected from other organs, her lab found a subset of species that didn’t appear elsewhere in the body. Salinas hypothesized that these species may have colonized the fish brains early in their development, before their blood-brain barriers had fully formed. “Early on, anything can go in; it’s a free-for-all,” she said.</p>
<p>But many of the microbial species were also found throughout the body. She suspects that most bacteria in the fishes’ brain microbiomes originated in their blood and guts, and continuously leak into the brain.</p>
<p>“After that first wave of colonization,” she said, “you need to have specific features to go in and out.”</p>
<p>Salinas was able to identify features that let bacteria make the crossing. Some could produce molecules, known as polyamines, that can open and close junctions, which are like little doors in the barrier that allow molecules to pass through. Others could produce molecules that help them evade the body’s immune response or compete with other bacteria.</p>
<p>Salinas even caught a bacterium in the act. Looking under the microscope, she captured an image of a bacterium frozen in time within the blood-brain barrier. “We literally caught it right in the middle of crossing,” she said.</p>
<p>It is possible that the microbes don’t live freely in the brain tissue but are engulfed by immune cells. That would be the “most boring interpretation of this paper,” Olm said, and would suggest that the fish have adapted to bacterial inhabitants by containing them.</p>
<p>However, if the bacteria are free-living, they could be involved in the body’s processes beyond the brain. It’s possible that the microbes actively regulate aspects of the creatures’ physiology, Salinas suggested, the way human gut microbiomes help regulate the digestive and immune systems.</p>
<p>Fish, of course, are not humans, but they allow a fair comparison, Salinas said. And her work suggests that if fish have microbes living in their brains, it’s possible we have them, too.</p>
</div><div data-role="selectable">
    <h2><strong>Impenetrable or Not?</strong></h2>
<p>Bacteria have been found living in just about every human organ system, but to many scientists the brain is a step too far. The blood-brain barrier has traditionally been seen as “impenetrable,” said <a href="https://www.dcu.ie/biotechnology/people/janosch-heller">Janosch Heller</a>, who studies the barrier at Dublin City University and was not involved in the new research. Plus, the brain has immune cells working overtime to zap any potentially harmful invaders. When microbes have been found in the human brain, they are are associated with active infections or typically linked to a breakdown in the barrier due to diseases such as Alzheimer’s.</p>
<p>This assumption was challenged in 2013, when scientists studying the neurological impacts of HIV/AIDS found genetic hints of bacteria in the brains of both sick and healthy people. The findings were <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0054673">the first to suggest</a> that maybe humans could have a brain microbiome in the absence of disease.</p>

<p>“No one believed it 10 years ago,” Heller said. Follow-up studies — there haven’t been many — have been inconclusive. “It is very easy to trick yourself into thinking microbes are present because microbial DNA is essentially everywhere,” Olm said. “So it would take a lot of evidence to convince me that it does exist.”</p>
<p>The fish experiment did convince him, and other researchers, that a human brain microbiome is not impossible. What is nearly impossible, however, is confirming that without harming healthy people. To build a case, Link suggested repeating the fish experiment in rodents. “This protocol should be able to be adapted really easily to mouse brains,” Salinas said — and indeed her team has started looking into it. They have found early hints that microbes exist in the olfactory bulbs of healthy mice and, to a lesser extent, throughout the brain.</p>
<p>“There’s no reason, if fish have them, that you wouldn’t have them, or that mice wouldn’t have them,” Link said. If microbes have adapted to cross the fish blood-brain barrier and survive in the fish brain, they could do the same in our bodies. It’s unlikely they would be present at the same levels as they are in fish, he added, “but that doesn’t mean there’s none.”</p>
        
        
<p>Even in small numbers, Link said, resident microbes could influence our brain metabolism and immune systems. If they are truly present, this would suggest an extra layer of neurological regulation that we didn’t know existed. We already know that microbes influence our neurobiology: Right now, microbes in your gut are <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/in-the-guts-second-brain-key-agents-of-health-emerge-20231121/">modulating your brain activity</a> through the gut-brain axis by producing metabolites that are sensed by enteric neurons winding through your digestive system.</p>
<p>It’s a fascinating, though unproved, proposition that bacteria in the brain are directly impacting our physiology. However, thanks to research like Salinas’, more scientists are open to the idea that healthy human brains might also be home to microbes.</p>
<p>“Why not?” Heller said. “I’m not shocked anymore that they are there.” The more interesting question, he said, is: “Are they all there for a reason, or are they there by mistake?”</p>

                    <p>Silk is an organic polymer material consisting of two silk fibroins wrapped in sericin<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Li, D. G. Silk Material Science. 53–90 (China Text Appar,  1994)." href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-78687-7#ref-CR1" id="ref-link-section-d35135915e475">1</a></sup>. As an object of archaeological interest, silk is not well preserved during long-term burial, and there are a large number of possible silk remnants, such as mineralized and charred forms, that cannot be identified even by basic morphology. In the early days of silk production, silk was not easy to obtain, and the silk that was produced was not considered an ordinary fabric, but rather, one whose important purposes included use in ritual sacrifice<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2" title="Zhao, F. The culture of silk originate. South. Cult. 1, 67–74 (1996)." href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-78687-7#ref-CR2" id="ref-link-section-d35135915e479">2</a></sup>. In the “Yue Ling” component of the <i>Li Ji</i>, the following is recorded: “When the work of sericulture was over, the cocoons were distributed to the women for their silk reeling, and then the weight of each was weighed to examine the achievements of each person, and the silk was used to make sacrificial clothes to worship Heaven and ancestors,” which shows that the silk obtained from mulberry silkworm is mainly used for sacrificial temple clothing. Similarly, silk was also used as a sacrificial object, such as in the form of silk books or paintings on silk, with the silk serving as a carrier to convey the content of the calligraphy and painting upon it to Heaven. Silk manuscripts were also used to record the alliance between the two countries. There is a Chinese idiom “turning war into jade and silk,” where the jade and silk are the materials for writing the nation’s letter, either buried in the ground or burned with fire, which means that oaths could be made to Heaven<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 3" title="Jing, D. A Research on the Using of silk Fabric in Etiquette during the Pre-Qin Periods (Southwest University, 2014)." href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-78687-7#ref-CR3" id="ref-link-section-d35135915e486">3</a></sup>. However, due to the organic properties of silk and the ways in which it was used in ancient times, very few silk objects have been preserved, and most that were preserved are those that were attached to bronze and iron objects. This is because copper and iron ions are constantly released after burial, which can create a bacteriostatic microenvironment in the surrounding soil that is conducive to the preservation of the cultural relics such as silk that are made of organic materials that gradually become mineralized marks on the surfaces of bronze and iron ware<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" title="Müller, M. et al.

Due to the natural protein properties of silk, the internal structure and external characteristics of silk cultural relics are irreversibly destroyed during the process of burial or when passed down through the generations until the production information and material components completely disappear, making it difficult to obtain direct archaeological evidence for pinpointing the origin of silk. The sacrificial pits at the Sanxingdui archaeologcal site, located in Guanghan, Sichuan, China, have been found with layers of ash above the layers of artifacts and some bronzes with fabric traces. Among the artifacts, one grid-like ware artifact first appeared in the Bronze Age in China. The two sides of the grid-like ware were grid-like ovals made of bronze material, and inside, there was an oval-shaped complete piece of jade with a bent back. Fabric traces were found on both the jade and bronze surfaces. In order to determine the specific function of fabric at this site, the developed silk fibroin immunoaffinity column (IAC) enrichment technique combined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), morphology observation and proteomics were used to identify mineralized fabric material and fabric residues in the ash layer. Silk residues were successfully detected, which confirmed the early use of silk as a material carrier to communicate between Heaven and Earth and provided archaeological evidence for the cultural origins of silk.</p><p>The Sanxingdui ruins in Southwest China’s Sichuan Basin were the center of the Sanxingdui culture (1600–1100 BC). In 1986, two “sacrificial pits” ( No. 1 and No. 2) containing ivory, jade, bronze, gold and other materials were found in the soil collected by a local brick factory. From 2018 to 2019, six more similar “sacrificial pits” were discovered between the first two pits<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 15" title="Sun, H. &amp; Peng, S.

A large number of bronze, jade, ivory and other inorganic cultural relics were unearthed in the pit.

Most of the artifacts showed signs of burning, and layers of ash were found above layers of artifacts in several pits<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="Ran, H. L. et al. Sanxingdui site sacrifice area, Guanghan City, Sichuan Province.

After artifacts are burned, the probability of organic relics being preserved decreases. To study the protein in the discovered textile residue in the ash layer and the mechanism by which it was produced, an ash layer with a thickness of approximately 20&nbsp;cm was extracted from sacrificial pit No. 4 (Fig.&nbsp;1b), which is located in the northeast of the sacrificial pit group. When the No. 7 sacrificial pit was unearthed, it revealed the first discovery of Chinese Bronze Age grid-like ware (SI Appendix, Section S1). The outside of this artifact is an oval-shaped bronze grid-like object divided into upper and lower layers, with a complete oval-shaped jade object inside the grid-like ware. Fortuitously, mineralized fabric traces were found on both the jade and bronze grid surfaces when the soil was cleaned from them. The mineralized fabric sample was taken from the fragments shed during the cleaning of the grid-like ware (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-78687-7#Fig1">1</a>a). To study the relationships among the fabric, jade and grid-like ware, most of the fabric remnants were retained in their original positions during cleaning. The interpretation from the partially visible fabric residue traces of the cultural relics was that the jade had first been wrapped with fabric and placed in the grid-like ware, and then the grid-like ware was wrapped with another piece of fabric and placed in the pit (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-78687-7#Fig2">2</a>). Through three-dimensional video microscopy, it was found that both fabrics were plain weave fabric (SI Appendix, Section S2) but had different warp and weft densities and were produced with different weaving styles (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-78687-7#Fig3">3</a>). Moreover, the remnant fabric on the grid-like component was stained. The ash layers and mineralized fabric traces found in the Sanxingdui excavation were expected to provide archaeological evidence of the early use of silk. Therefore, researchers have been eager to find a reliable and accurate method to detect fabric residues in ash layers and mineralized fabric materials.</p><div data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-1" data-title="Fig. 1"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig1" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 1</b></figcaption><div><div><a data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-78687-7/figures/1" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-024-78687-7/MediaObjects/41598_2024_78687_Fig1_HTML.png?as=webp"><img aria-describedby="Fig1" src="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-024-78687-7/MediaObjects/41598_2024_78687_Fig1_HTML.png" alt="figure 1" loading="lazy" width="685" height="241"></picture></a></div><p>Mineralized fabric sample (<b>a</b>) and ash layer sample from No. 4 sacrificial pit (<b>b</b>) unearthed at Sanxingdui Site.</p></div><p><a data-test="article-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="button" data-track-action="view figure" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-78687-7/figures/1" data-track-dest="link:Figure1 Full size image" aria-label="Full size image figure 1" rel="nofollow"><span>Full size image</span></a></p></figure></div><div data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-2" data-title="Fig. 2"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig2" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 2</b></figcaption><div><div><a data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-78687-7/figures/2" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-024-78687-7/MediaObjects/41598_2024_78687_Fig2_HTML.jpg?as=webp"><img aria-describedby="Fig2" src="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-024-78687-7/MediaObjects/41598_2024_78687_Fig2_HTML.jpg" alt="figure 2" loading="lazy" width="685" height="281"></picture></a></div><p>Schematic diagram of fabric wrapped grid shape ware.

Moreover, burning and high temperatures undermine the preservation of silk, and most of the cultural relics unearthed in Sanxingdui have traces of burning. Moreover, silk residue is mixed with ash, soil and various artifacts in the pit, which presents a great challenge for identifying silk in the pit. Thus, it is not difficult to imagine how over the long course of history, the silk buried in the pit has lost its original appearance and now exists as a residue or trace that is difficult to identify with the naked eye. The silks from the Sanxingdui site show these extreme states of mineralization and conversion to ash and no longer belong to the category of textiles in the traditional sense. The developed silk fibroin IAC can enrich and extract silk residues from archaeological collections and effectively improve proteomics detection of silk proteins. The discovery of silk and its residues at the Sanxingdui sacrificial pits is reliant on the use of new technologies that greatly improve the extraction level of organic residues.</p><p>The essence of textile mineralization is that the organic components in the fabric are replaced by inorganic substances. From the existing studies on fiber mineralization, it can be seen that the essence of mineralization is the migration, enrichment and exchange of different ions in a certain liquid and substance, and finally the process of precipitation and mineralization due to changes in condition<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 46" title="Zhang, M. et al.

From the morphology of Sanxingdui mineralized silk the preservation state of fibers can be seen. The fibers were hollow, which indicated a high degree of mineralization, but there were differences in the degree of mineralization of silks in different regions. Mineralization involves an ion exchange process, so the area near the copper will show a higher degree of mineralization. In addition, copper ions penetrate the interior of the fiber as water molecules enter and accumulate in specific areas of the fiber under the action of gravity. These areas are more prone to mineralization due to longer exposure to copper ions. The morphology of fiber is preserved during mineralization, which provided the morphological information for residue identification.</p><p>Sanxingdui is the capital city of the ancient Shu State and was founded by the ancient Shu ancestors. The sericulture and silk weaving industry in Sanxingdui has a long history, and the historical accounts about sericulture in ancient China are mostly related to the land of the Shu State<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 47" title="Guo, J.

Sima Qian wrote in the “Annals of the Five Emperors” in the <i>Records of the Grand Historian</i> that “the Yellow Emperor lived on the hill of Xuanyuan and married the daughter of Xiling family.” Huang Di Yuan Concubine Leizu Xiling taught others to raise silkworms, and the legend Leizu is from the people of Chengdu in Sichuan. “Shiwen” says that “Shu” refers to “mulberry worms,” that is, “silkworm larvae.” The character “Shu” is related to the initial sericulture,” referring to the beginning of the Shu State and the people practicing sericulture, for whom sericulture was central to their economic activities<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 48" title="Mao, X.

However, no silk or its residues have been found in Sanxingdui’s previous archaeology.

At the Sanxingdui sacrificial pits, post-incineration silk residues and silk traces attached to the surfaces of bronzes and jades were found, providing archaeological evidence for exploring the uses of silk, especially the silk traces on the surfaces of the grid-like ware and jade. These discoveries suffice to verify that silk was used as a material carrier for communication between Heaven and Earth at that time. There is a record called “Jiatu Zhijia” about emperor Yao passing the throne to emperor Shun that states emperor Yao was ordered by Heaven to pass the throne to Yu Shun, and the divine turtle conveyed the order of emperor Yao passing the throne to Yu Shun on behalf of the emperor of Heaven. The shape of the “Jiatu” described in this text is very similar to that of the grid-like ware unearthed at the Sanxingdui site, so the silk remnants on the surface of the jade and grid-like ware can be surmised to have been the material carriers of communication between Heaven and Earth. Silk was also used in burial clothing, as wearing silk after death would help people communicate with Heaven. Evidence for this can be found in the literature. In the <i>Book of Rites</i>, it is stated that “linen is used for clothing of the living, and silk is mainly used for clothing of corpses.”</p><p>In summary, we have developed a silk fibroin IAC that can effectively enrich the residues of silk in archaeological samples. Combining it with ELISA and proteomics techniques can significantly improve the detection level of silk residues, thereby preventing the loss of valuable information from a large number of precious silk cultural relics. The first discovery of silk traces and residues at the Sanxingdui archaeological site, providing archaeological evidence for the use of silk in ritual contexts and providing more information on how the ancient Shu people of 3,000 years ago expressed their religion. Given that the target detection substance has a protein property, this technology is expected to be applied to the trace exploration of early human covert materials such as fur, which have been used in history but have now become invisible archaeological remains, and further improve the detection level of organic textile materials.</p></div></div><div id="Sec400-section" data-title="Methods"><h2 id="Sec400">Methods</h2><div id="Sec400-content"><h3 id="Sec4008">Extraction of silk fibroin from mineralized fabric or cultural relics samples</h3><p>Three micrograms of mineralized sample and 5&nbsp;g of ash layer sample were placed in silk protein extraction solution and dissolved in a water bath at 95 ± 2 ℃ for 45&nbsp;min.

<p>In science fiction, the xenomorph emerges as a creature that transcends the boundaries of traditional extraterrestrial movie knowledge (Fordham, 2023). From the corridors of the spaceship <em>USCSS Nostromo</em> to the haunting silence of the primordial exoplanet Acheron LV-426 (Flowers, 2020), the creature created by Ridley Scott and H.R. Giger has become the symbol of alien terror in movies and in collective imagination (Domino, 2019).</p>
<p>Beyond the movies, xenomorphs can also be seen as a zoological and biochemical scientific challenge (Chemist, 2017). The cinematic universe of <em>Alien</em> introduces the xenomorph as an alien force, both literally and metaphorically (Feel No Pain, 2023). Our exploration begins with an examination of their hypothetical taxonomic classification, an attempt to place these creatures within the framework of known biological diversity (Pratt, 1972).</p>
<h2>TAXONOMY</h2>
<p>Taxonomic levels presented in this paragraph are based only on morphological features not considering genomic analysis due to the absence of DNA sequences for fictional creatures. Some characteristics are shared between the various classification levels of living organisms and can be used as comparative parameters for our speculation.</p>
<p>The xenomorph’s multicellular structure serves as a cornerstone for its classification within Animalia (Ros-Rocher et al., 2021). Its intricate organization of cells, tissues, and organs reflects a level of biological complexity commonly associated with animals. Xenomorphs can be included into the Arthropoda phylum due to the morphological similarities shared with certain terrestrial arthropods such as an exoskeletal structure, a segmented body plan, the presence of hemolymph, etc. (Akam, 2000). Xenomorphs and chelicerates can be morphologically connected, justifying its classification within the class Chelicerata (Sharma, 2018). Similarities are shared in limb structure and mouthparts, aligning the xenomorph with arachnids. The chelicerate-like tail, i.e., the telson, is a distinctive hallmark of the xenomorph, further reinforcing this classification (Howard et al., 2019). In recognition of the xenomorph’s unparalleled morphology and extraterrestrial origin, a novel taxonomic order, Xenomorpha, is proposed. This order serves as a specialized category crafted to accommodate the unique characteristics exhibited by the xenomorph. The family Xenomorphidae emerges as the categorization that embraces the diverse variations among different xenomorph species depicted in cinematic portrayals. This taxonomic family acknowledges the variability within the xenomorph lineage, providing a framework to encapsulate the differences observed in various cinematic depictions such as the dog-xenomorph in <em>Alien 3</em> or the neomorph in the new franchise. The family is also based on the original host of the facehugger. At the genus level, the overarching features shared among diverse xenomorph variants coalesce under the name <em>Xenomorphus</em>. This taxonomic designation emphasizes the exoskeleton, the scorpion-like tail, the acidic blood, and all the characteristics of some arthropods, as a central unifying trait among different xenomorph manifestations. The species name, <em>Xenomorphus extraterrestris</em>, encapsulates the xenomorph’s extraterrestrial origin. While maintaining a taxonomically specific identity, this nomenclature acknowledges the unique evolutionary path and biological distinctiveness of the xenomorph within the proposed taxonomic framework.</p>
<h2>MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES</h2>
<p>Xenomorphs are extraordinary animals with unique characteristics that let them be able to colonize extreme environments, occupying every single niche. As for some living organisms on our planet, xenomorphs can be considered extremophiles; particularly, they can be defined as polyextremophiles as shown in the different movies. They are able to survive in many different environments spanning from the cold interstellar space to the extremely hot furnace in <em>Alien 3</em> (1992). Their ability to thrive and hunt in extremely harsh conditions could be due to their morphological features such as the robust exoskeleton, the scorpion-like tail and some biochemical adaptations, e.g., the acidic blood.</p>
<p><strong>Exoskeleton.</strong> The xenomorph’s exoskeleton is a structure composed probably of a unique amalgamation of chitin and other resistant organic compounds, and stands as the main characteristic of resilience. As depicted in <em>Aliens</em> (1986), it not only serves as a protective barrier against flamethrowers and bullets but also showcases an adaptability akin to the exoskeletons found in Earth’s terrestrial arthropods (Giribet &amp; Edgecombe, 2019). The cinematic narrative mimics the real-world resilience observed in beetles, renowned for their robust exoskeletons that withstand different adversities <a href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?qOmVhH">(</a>Nagasawa, 2012; Stamm et al., 2021).</p>
<p><strong>Cephalothorax.</strong> A defining feature inspired by arachnid anatomy is the xenomorph’s cephalothorax that takes a focal point in its anatomical design, as observed in <em>Alien: Resurrection</em> (1997). The emphasis on the xenomorph’s cephalothorax reveals a carapace that not only shields vital sensory organs but also integrates with the creature’s sensory systems as shown by the tube-like structures on the back that are probably chemo-sensors or the breathing system, similar to the book-lungs of arachnids (Machalowski et al., 2020).</p>
<p><strong>Chelicerae.</strong> The xenomorph’s chelicerae are a captivating feature, as shown in <em>Alien</em> (1979), offering a glimpse into their predatory arsenal. Chelicerae are probably reminiscent of the efficient mouthparts seen in arachnids, horseshoe crabs, and sea spiders, unfolding as multifunctional tools that play a pivotal role in the xenomorph’s hunting and defensive strategies (Sharma, 2017). In the whole series of movies, it is evident that the fangs, pincers, or jaws of the xenomorphs are transparent, maybe suggesting that they are hollow and they can contain some venomous glands. In addition to the arachnid-like chelicerae, xenomorphs also present a predator inner jaw that mimics the one found in moray eels (Johnson, 2019).</p>

<p><strong>Limbs.</strong> Prominently featured in <em>Alien 3</em>, the xenomorph’s segmented limbs can be seen as scythe-like talons contribute to a predatory adaptation (Panganiban et al., 1995). The segmented structure of the limbs offers both flexibility and strength (Gao et al., 2012), allowing the xenomorph to transition between stalking its prey and executing lethal strikes. A behavior that we can also find in some animals such as mantis shrimps (Stomatopoda). The dynamic mobility enables the xenomorph to move in different environments with agility, from the confined spaces of spacecraft to the corridors of alien worlds.</p>

<p><strong>Scorpion-like tail.</strong> The xenomorph’s elongated segmented tail, featured in all the franchise, emerges as one of the most fascinating morphological characteristics with a multifaceted purpose. This tail, complete with a stinger or a telson that serves as offensive and defensive roles, aligns with the multifunctional tails observed in scorpions (Lourenço, 2018; Carmichael, 2022). Differently from them, the tail of xenomorphs does not seems to contain a venomous substance.</p>

<p><strong>Extraterrestrial ovipositor.</strong> The extraterrestrial ovipositor (seen only for xenomorph queens) facilitate the precise implantation of embryos into host organisms. The xenomorph’s ovipositor showcases reproductive adaptations reminiscent of certain wasps (Quicke &amp; Fitton, 1995). In the movies, the massive tube-jelly-like organ that composes the whole ovipositor is evident. It seems that the queen is not able to move freely when connected to this structure, which can be removed when necessary.</p>
<h2>XENOMORPH BIOCHEMISTRY</h2>
<h3>Acidic hemolymph</h3>
<p>The acidic hemolymph of xenomorphs is a hallmark of their unique biochemistry. Hypotheses surrounding the origins of acidity point towards an unconventional enzymatic cascade within the xenomorph’s hemolymph, potentially involving hyper-reactive acid-base equilibria (Grifoni et al., 2019). We can hypothesize the presence of specialized enzymes capable of generating highly acidic intermediates during metabolic processes.</p>
<p>Thus, we could hypothesize, for instance, the presence of organic acids such as thioacids and haloacids in xenomorph hemolymph, which would raise questions about the biochemical pathways responsible for their synthesis and their specific roles in maintaining the acidic milieu (Dong et al., 2018). Thioacids, known for their strong acidic properties, present a fascinating topic for exploration <a href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?Jw3dFz">(</a>Ulrich &amp; Jakob, 2019; Wang et al., 2022). The reactivity of these thioacids could serve dual purposes, acting both as defensive agents against external threats and as key components in the xenomorph’s metabolic processes.</p>
<p>The possible presence also of haloacids, featuring halogen atoms such as chlorine, would introduce another layer of complexity to xenomorph biochemistry (Su et al., 2016). The incorporation of haloacids into the acidic hemolymph could enhance corrosive properties, potentially explaining the rapid degradation observed in xenomorph blood interactions with various materials (e.g., HF if able to corrode glass). Drawing inspiration from terrestrial haloacid-tolerating organisms (Wang et al., 2021), the xenomorph’s ability to synthesize and deploy these acids unveils a biochemical strategy that extends beyond conventional defensive mechanisms.</p>
<p>Determining the acidity of the xenomorph hemolymph involves making several assumptions due to the speculative nature of the creature and its fictional biochemistry. However, we can discuss a hypothetical scenario. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid, and its derivatives could contribute to the xenomorph hemolymph acidity. If we consider a concentration of 1 M sulfuric acid, the pH would be approximately 0 (all the protons of the acid are released into the solution). The xenomorph’s hemolymph may contain a mixture of acids, such as thioacids and haloacids. We can assume a collective concentration of these acids equivalent to a 1 M solution of hydrochloric acid. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation:</p>
<p>pH = pKa + log([A<sup>–</sup>]/[HA]),</p>
<p>we can assume a pKa of -log(1), and a 1:1 ratio of dissociated (A-) to undissociated (HA) acid, giving a pH result of approximately 0.</p>
<p>Chemist (2017) suggested that the acidic composition of the hemolymph could be the superacid HF⋅SbF<sub>5</sub> or a mixture between minor components, such as hydrofluoric acid (HF), sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>).</p>
<p>The purpose of xenomorph blood is also explored through comic book lore, particularly from Lasalle Bionational’s research in the <em>Aliens vs Predator</em> series (Xenopedia, 2024). According to this lore, xenomorph blood serves as a biological battery, generating a powerful bio-electric charge through a chemical reaction. This unique energy source replaces the need for traditional respiration and digestion, which raises questions about how xenomorphs might recharge this energy source, leading to the eventual death of the creatures in case it is not renewable (Chemist, 2017).</p>
<p>The concept introduces an intriguing idea that xenomorphs have evolved a more efficient energy source than humans. While humans rely on consuming food for energy through oxidation/reduction reactions, xenomorphs use a stream of electrons as a power source, similar to recently discovered organisms on Earth, e.g., chemolithophilic organisms. This alternative energy pathway suggests a unique evolutionary path for the xenomorphs, making them “cosmically tenacious”.</p>
<h3>Exoskeletal resilience</h3>
<p>Unlike typical corrosive substances, the xenomorph’s acidic hemolymph displays a specificity in its corrosive action. Hypotheses propose the presence of molecular inhibitors within the exoskeleton, forming a protective barrier against the acid’s corrosive effects (e.g., Wang et al., 2018). One potential candidate is a class of chelating agents that selectively bind to metal ions, preventing them from participating in the acid-base reactions responsible for corrosion (Gulcin &amp; Alwasel, 2022). To resist the extremely acidic conditions of the hemolymph, the exoskeleton could be composed by anti-corrosive substances such as &nbsp;fluoropolymers. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) stands out as one of the best molecular candidates for composing the exoskeleton of xenomorphs, owing to several distinctive characteristics. Firstly, it is renowned for its extreme chemical inertness and high-temperature resistance. Being a fluorine-based compound, it does not react with hydrofluoric acid, showcasing resistance to chemical agents. It is well-documented that xenomorph chitin-like structure (Elieh-Ali-Komi &amp; Hamblin, 2016) retains its resistance to acid even after the creature’s demise or the removal of its exoskeleton as shown in <em>Alien vs Predator </em>(2004). The chemical inertness of PTFE would be crucial in ensuring the durability and resilience of the xenomorph exoskeleton. The high-temperature rating of PTFE would also allow xenomorphs to operate in extremely hot environments without compromising their physical abilities as shown in <em>Alien 3</em> when molten metallic substances are poured onto xenomorph’s body.</p>
<h3>The fluorescent color</h3>
<p>The vivid fluorescent green/yellow shade of xenomorph hemolymph introduces another layer of mystery to its biochemistry. Fluorescence in biological systems often stems from the presence of specific molecules, and in the case of xenomorphs, hypothetical bio-fluorophores would contribute to this glow. One plausible candidate is a family of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with extended conjugated systems (Zhang et al., 2020). These molecules, absorbing light at one wavelength and re-emitting it at a longer wavelength, could be responsible for the xenomorph’s fluorescent coloration. PAHs are generally known for their stability and resistance to acidic conditions, particularly in comparison to more reactive compounds (Abdel-Shafy &amp; Mansour, 2016). The aromatic nature of PAHs, characterized by a stable ring structure, contributes to their overall resistance to chemical degradation under acidic conditions (Patel et al., 2020). This structural robustness is a key factor in explaining how the xenomorph’s fluorescent biochemistry maintains its luminosity even within the context of its acidic hemolymph.</p>
<p>On the other hand, one typical solution in terrestrial organisms for bioluminescence is the luciferin pathway. A phenomenon that occurs in species belonging to very distant phyla, the emission of light plays an important role in the life cycle of the involved organisms (Syed &amp; Anderson, 2021; Ke &amp; Tsai, 2022). By oxidizing luciferins, the enzyme luciferase is able to produce an intermediate excited state oxyluciferin that will later decay to a ground energy state by emitting photons. Given such an ominous name, it is not unlikely that the creators of the xenomorph could have engineered a similar mechanism to that of the luciferase pathway, thanks to their natural prowess in genetic engineering as featured in both <em>Prometheus </em>(2012) and <em>Alien: Covenant</em> (2017). Special attention must have been paid to stabilize the tertiary structure under such acidic conditions, notably the binding site and the corresponding luciferin substrate, a feat that is more than extraordinary given our current means and knowledge in bioengineering.</p>
<h2>PARASITOID BEHAVIOR</h2>
<p>It is evident from the movies that there are many different stages in the organism’s growth. Beginning with the parasitoid implantation of embryos, a biological relationship is established as the xenomorph utilizes host organisms as incubators for its progeny. This parasitoid interplay is exemplified in <em>Alien</em>, where a facehugger marks the initiation of the xenomorph’s life cycle (Kuris &amp; Luo, 2023).</p>
<p>As the xenomorph’s life cycle progresses, the chestburster emerges. The xenomorph’s ability to change different host species emphasizes its parasitoid versatility (e.g., Manwell, 1957). This flexibility is exemplified in <em>Alien 3</em>, which showcased the infection of the dog in the facility by a facehugger, and in <em>Alien: Covenant</em>, which introduced the neomorph, a variant of the xenomorph species displaying distinct parasitic characteristics. Thus, the seed of the xenomorph, the “black goo” (Chemical A0-3959X.91–15), serves to illustrate the skills of the extraterrestrial creators of the xenomorph. Not only they engineered a lethal weapon, but managed to bypass all the extant species barriers successfully targeting all animal-like life-forms.</p>
<p>Giving some real-world analogs, the xenomorph’s tactics aligns with those of parasitic wasp, such as species of <em>Glyptapanteles</em>, which lays eggs inside caterpillars; the chestburster’s emergence mimics the invasive nature of parasitoids in terrestrial environments (Surridge, 2008). Species of the ichneumonid wasp genus <em>Megarhyssa</em> use its long ovipositor to deposit eggs deep within wood-boring insects, which is also a striking parallel to the xenomorph’s ovipositor and its precise implantation of embryos into host organisms (Crankshaw &amp; Matthews, 1981). In <em>Alien: Covenant</em> it is evident the common features between the neomorphs and the parasitic fungi of the genus <em>Ophiocordyceps</em>, which manipulate the behavior of their insect hosts (Araújo et al., 2021).</p>

<p>During one of his “yes or no” Instagram Q&amp;As, Scott Rao lamented the declining quality of Kenyan coffees over the last three years—a sentiment I’ve heard echoed by buyers across Europe, the US, and Australia. He kicked a different question over to me about whether cultivar or microclimate or process has the greatest cup impact, and I demurred, offering that the relationship is gestalt but that processing ultimately had the final say —invoking Kenya’s declining cup quality as an example.</p>



<p>In our DMs, I shared with Scott my theory about the cause of this phenomenon—and noted that it was connected to some of the challenges of working there as a coffee buyer. He suggested I write a blog about it—a suggestion that I got from more than a dozen of my followers later that night.</p>



<p>So here it is.</p>



<p>Kenyan coffee holds a special place in the hearts and minds of specialty coffee buyers and roasters. Coffees from Kenya are prized for their physical density, long shelf life, vibrant acidity, intense cup profile, and often, distinctive aromatics like currant (or tomato—depending who you ask).&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’ve written about the most memorable coffee I’ve ever cupped—<a href="https://christopherferan.com/2020/02/18/so-a-coffee-walks-into-a-sauna/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the one that got away</a>. It was a Kenyan.</p>



<p>The most common theory explaining the apparent decline in quality of Kenyan coffees rests the blame with an increase in Ruiru 11 and Batian in the lots (and, concurrently, a decline in SL-28 and SL-34). I’ve <a href="https://christopherferan.com/2021/03/02/missing-the-forest-for-a-tree/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">written about that too</a> (about halfway through) and don’t buy that argument.</p>



<p>And besides—looking at the export lots available from many of the more famous estates and associations, as well as <a href="https://afca.coffee/african-taste-of-harvest/#kenya" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">African Taste of Harvest</a> winners—it’s clear that many (if not most) contain at least some of these hybrids.</p>



<p>I don’t buy it.</p>



<hr>



<p>Kenya is a tricky place to work as a buyer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While in some origins, a smallholder would be able to grow and process their coffee as they please and then have a choice to either sell that parchment or dried cherry to any exporter in the country for immediate payment—or even secure their own export license and self-export—producers in Kenya are removed from the commercial market, their coffee passing through a Byzantine and colonial export system that centralizes sales through an auction system with exporters in the position of greatest power, sacrificing traceability and financial transparency along the way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It means we can’t work directly—not really, anyway—and have to navigate through the labyrinth of the auction system to secure the coffees we want, all the while wondering where the $5 or $6 or $7 per pound we’re paying is really going.</p>



<p>Coffee wasn’t something that was native to Kenya or even traditionally grown there—even as Kenya shares a border with Uganda (home of robusta) and Ethiopia (the birthplace of Arabica). Though first introduced to Kenya in 1893 by John Paterson on behalf of the Scottish Mission from seeds obtained from the British East India Company, the completion of the Ugandan Railway and arrival of European settlers ultimately led to the introduction of plantation agriculture and large-scale cultivation of cash crops like tea, wheat, sisal—and coffee. As a colony of the British crown, the settlers were tasked with paying for construction of the railway and the export of coffee was expanded rapidly to settle the debt. </p>



<p>By 1912, Kiambu-Kikuyu boasted plantations several hundred acres in size.</p>



<p>Of the larger export companies still operating in Kenya, many have their roots in the colonial period, such as Dorman’s, which was founded in the 1950s, and Taylor Winch in the 1960s. I’ll never forget the first time I walked into the offices of these two companies and noted that the managers and people in charge were all white—either Europeans or white, Kenyan-born descendents of British settlers—and everyone cleaning up the cupping table when we were done was an indigenous Kenyan person (<em>one of the bosses of one of the companies—a white man, of course—was even wearing a khaki safari shirt. You just can’t make this shit up)</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Within hours of arriving in Nairobi for the first time, it was clear to me that coffee in Kenya still largely operated as an extractive, neo-colonialist enterprise.</p>



<p>In Kenya, if a producer has less than 5 acres, they legally need a coop or society to process and market their coffees. Historically, around 30% of coffee in Kenya comes from estates, with the remainder coming from some 400+ cooperative societies—but in recent years that number has shifted to 45% from Kenya’s roughly 24,000 estates and the remainder from around 85,000 smallholders (according to the Kenya Coffee Traders Association’s <em>Kenya Coffee Directory</em>).</p>



<p>The best co-ops might have financing available to producers as well as traceability and receipt systems in place to maintain some transparency as coffee passes through the export system. The societies own and operate the washing stations (there called factories) where their members’ coffee is processed (according to the export standards in the country, all export coffee must be washed).</p>



<p>After coffee has been fermented, washed and dried, movement permits are pulled (a legal requirement to transport coffee anywhere in the country) and it’s sent to one of the country’s eight mills, which is paid to remove the husk and sort the coffee to prepare for sale through the auction or an exporter.</p>



<p>In Kenya, though, millers cannot export themselves; coffee must pass through a “marketing agent” to make the sale to an exporter — a <em>bonus</em> middleman special to Kenya’s system.</p>



<p>The miller selects and hires the marketing agent, which is, in practice, very often one and the same entity. This system is lubricated through bribery: marketing agents pay allowance to board members of societies to get them to agree to market their coffee through that agent, which in turn affiliates them with an exporter. (It’s likely illegal, and some marketing agents such as Coffee Management Services/Dorman’s <em>insist</em> they don’t engage in the practice).</p>



<p>From there, the marketing agent markets the coffee on behalf of the society and miller to exporters to earn their 1.76-3% commission. </p>



<p>In Kenya, though, the coffee remains the property of the society until its final sale through auction or export, with fees deducted along the way. The remainder is paid to the society, which in turn takes its own cut and pays out the farmers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In effect, this means that a farmer whose coffee was harvested and processed in October and exported in March would not get paid until March or April—some six months later, and well into the flowering period for main crop. Any nutrients, amendments, fertilizers, or pesticides the farmer needs—let alone the costs of food, housing and living for themselves or their families—would need to be financed for that 6 month period prior to final payment from the exporter to the society and from the society to the farmer.</p>



<p>Commercial financing rates for coffee producers in Kenya are higher than 20%, effectively making them agricultural payday loans. Co-ops often offer lower rates—but still higher than 10%. These financing costs compound the actual cost of production for smallholders and diminish their profits once that final sale is complete.</p>



<p>And if a miller isn’t honest or reputable, out turns from the mill may be low—80% is quite common—lowering yields and driving up costs to the grower even further—and creating an opportunity for the miller’s pocket to be lined (which is the most fucking colonial British thing ever—it sort of reminds me of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.elizabethan-era.org.uk/elizabethan-executions.htm" target="_blank">Elizabethan England where you’d tip your executioner</a> to ensure they did good, clean work and removed your head in one swing).</p>



<p>In order to improve the speed of payment, a society <em>could</em> do its own milling (for example, if they’re larger or a union member with access to resources) by building a mill or reactivating an unused mill at which point a society could get a grower/marketing license (likely while paying absurdly high interest rates on the capital they invested to build the mill)—however, according to the <em>Kenya Coffee Directory</em>, only 9 of these licenses have been issued.</p>



<p>But even then—the society still can’t export; they just control their own milling and keep that process control and the fee that would otherwise pass to a third party.</p>



<p>Most of the coffee that flows through auction system comes from as few as eight marketing agents, four of which are vertically-integrated and owned by subsidiaries of the major export players (like CMS which is owned by Dorman’s, Tropical which is owned by Neumann Group, and SMS which is owned by ECOM).&nbsp;</p>



<p>In total, at the time of my last visit to Kenya in 2016 there were just 45 export licenses for coffee in the entire country. The amount of money passed between entities to establish blocks of power in otherwise competing businesses is otherwise pretty staggering—money passing from one hand to the other in a scheme that effectively fixes prices paid to producers across the country and limits the ability of producers to sell their coffee freely in a competitive market.</p>



<p>For example, Dorman’s, which was founded in 1950 and is the oldest exporter in Kenya, used to be a part of Taylor Winch and ED&amp;F Man. It’s now independent, or so it says—but ECOM is its shareholder and financier in spite of the fact that ECOM has its own export license and separate marketing agent pipeline.</p>



<p>No matter which demon you sell to, it all ends up in the devil’s pocket.</p>



<p>Dorman’s supplies coffee to many of the most famous third wave roasters in the world<em> (I once got kicked out of a Dorman’s cupping because a certain Scandinavian guest of honor arrived and wanted a chance to cup the coffees first</em>) and offers certain advantages to societies that hire CMS to market their coffees.</p>



<p>By selling cherry through Dorman’s, producers get access to loans and pre-financing below commercial rates, as well as training on good agricultural practices and assistance getting certifications. Dorman’s extends these benefits as a way to access producers directly rather than having them sell to societies, though roughly 30% of all coffee that Dorman’s exports comes through cooperatives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dorman’s might pay a society something in the realm of 85 shillings per kilo of cherry, or around $0.75-0.80 USD per kg—significantly higher than the country average of 65 shillings per kilo ($0.57-0.60).</p>



<p>On the high end this translates, roughly, to the equivalent of around $1.85 per pound of green coffee—a pretty good price, to be sure—though it pales in comparison with the $5-7 per pound most roasters are used to paying for Kenyan coffee.</p>



<p>But the average price paid to producers for cherry translates roughly to $1.42 per pound.</p>



<p>The best coops, where premiums of 85 shillings per kg are paid, might retain 5% of the sale, but it’s extremely common for coops to retain roughly 20% from the sale, leaving, in the typical case, just $1.13 per pound to a producer—well below their costs of production, even before the marketing agent’s 3%, or milling fees (roughly $70 per metric ton), or out turns, or financing costs that float a producer between harvests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Seriously: Why bother?</p>

<p>About 25 years ago, Kenya’s coffee production was about triple what it is today. Some of that has to do with politics—the second president of Kenya, Daniel arap Moi, took away the support system for coffee as a mechanism to suppress opposition—some has to do with competing exports (like tea) being more lucrative or liquid, but largely, urban sprawl consumed lands used for coffee cultivation as Nairobi exploded in population from just 850,000 in 1980 to nearly 5 million in 2021:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Kenya’s acreage under coffee production has decreased by over 30 percent from about 170,000 hectares in early 1990s to about 119,000 hectare in 2020. The production of the cash crop has also decreased by a whopping 70 percent from a peak of 129,000 metric tons in 1983-84 coffee year to about 40,000 metric tons currently. </p>
<cite>[<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/africa/2021-07/06/c_1310044505.htm" target="_blank">source</a>]</cite></blockquote>



<p>Why bother, indeed: why grow coffee when you can make a better living by selling your land?</p>



<p>But that’s a problem: declining production means declining efficiency, and most of the factories in Kenya were built to accommodate massive volume.</p>



<p>Until <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/africa/2021-07/06/c_1310044505.htm" target="_blank">recent reforms</a> in 2021, the style and process of coffee was dictated to producers, limiting their ability to refine processes as volumes fluctuated or account for new techniques, technologies, or the evolving tastes of buyers (as I understand it, it was illegal until recently to export natural processed Kenyan coffees for this reason).</p>



<p>At peak production, Kenyan factories faced issues and bottlenecks familiar to many coffee producers around the world—most often as it entered the phase of processing requiring the most space and time: drying. Even if conditions were right and if the coffee were dried in full sun, it could take 7-9 days for coffee to dry enough to move into storage. To break down pulp in a dry fermentation—as is the standard in Kenya—it might only take 12-20 hours.</p>



<p>This means that as cherry was received, it would pile up, awaiting drying. It’s kind of like when you’re try to do three loads of laundry in a side-by-side washer and drier: the wash cycle might only take 30-35 minutes but the drier might take an hour. You have to wait for the drier to finish before you can move your clothes over and begin the next cycle. But if you wait too long—the clothes (the cherry) will rot.</p>



<p>So what do you do?</p>



<p>You <em>could</em> build more space for drying—or you could engineer workarounds to elongate the first part of the process to synchronize when coffee exits drying and more coffee enters, in essence creating a buffer for drying space.</p>



<p>In Kenya, this meant the introduction of the “double washed” or “double fermented” style of coffee many buyers are familiar with. Coffee would be fermented dry for 12-24 hours, washed, and then sent to a holding tank where it would be soaked in clean, cool water for up to an additional 24 hours or longer (the so-called “secondary fermentation”). In some mills, after the initial 12-24 hour dry fermentation and washing, a second dry fermentation would occur before soaking. A single pass through the fermentation step, though — ferment, wash, soak — could theoretically extend the amount of time that coffee could hang out before drying by a day or two, enough time to delay sending the coffee to dry and allowing the factory to make space on drying tables.</p>



<p>One thing Lucia Solis and I have long disagreed about is the necessity or efficacy of the “second fermentation” in Kenyan style washed processes. Lucia argues that it’s inefficient, creating an additional step and prolonging the processing time and therefore unnecessarily increasing costs. She believes the same flavor profile could be generated using other techniques. </p>



<p>I counter that it was a technique that was, in fact, introduced to engineer a solution to capacity issues and therefore <em>is </em>efficient because it requires no additional infrastructure — merely idle time.&nbsp;Further, I believe there is merit to the notion that the soak functions as a “secondary fermentation” (though really it should be called a “sequential” fermentation process) producing a flavor profile that would be more difficult and riskier to achieve in a less time-intensive manner.</p>



<p>Coffee fermentations are, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://christopherferan.com/2020/05/04/sourdough-sour-coffee/" target="_blank">as I’ve discussed in the past</a>, mixed microbial fermentations involving “the activity of a wide range of microorganisms such as yeasts, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), acetic acid bacteria (AAB), spore-forming bacteria, and molds.” (Masoud et al. 2004; Schwan and Wheals 2004; Nielsen et al. 2007, 2013). Typically, over the course of a coffee fermentation, the population dominant in the tank will modulate based on the environmental temperature, pH of the fermentation, availability of oxygen and nutrient, fermentable sugar concentration, and finally, ethanol content.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While yeast is associated with degradation of the pectins in coffee mucilage, bacteria such as LAB and AAB are associated with the production of acids (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.3390/%20fermentation7010009" target="_blank">Ruta,L.L.; Farcasanu,I.C. Coffee and Yeasts: From Flavor to Biotechnology. <em>Fermentation</em> 2021, 7, 9</a>). The specific fermentation kinetics dictate the microbial succession as different microbes will be better adapted for certain conditions at different times during the fermentation. At the onset of fermentation, lactic acid bacteria and yeast may grow in tandem, with LAB having a briefer (or no) lag phase and therefore producing metabolites before yeast has established. However, as a byproduct, in addition to lactic acid (which lowers the pH in the fermentation tank) LAB may produce—or enable production from other microorganisms—compounds that are toxic to LAB, leading the bacteria to die off or stagnate. Yeast, however, are more robust and would continue to ferment and replicate, and by virtue of their metabolism, continue to break down sugar and produce alcohol, carbon dioxide and (under ideal conditions) secondary metabolites.</p>



<p>This daisy chain of microbial activity creates a situation where the pH in the tank has dropped (probably to between 5-6), the moisture level has increased (as water is liberated from the disintegrating mucilage), there is quite a bit of ethanol (because of the yeast), and there is plenty of oxygen in the environment (because these fermentations are conducted uncovered and in ambient air). This is the most favorable set of conditions for the replication of AAB. Whether or not LAB continues its own metabolism, left unchecked, AAB will replicate and produce vinegar—rendering the resulting coffee defective.</p>



<p>But Kenyan processors introduced an extra step to interrupt this cycle halfway through—they washed the coffee (stripping away most of the food source for our fermenters, as well as the acids hanging out loose in the tank) and added fresh water (diluting the concentration of sugars thus inhibiting LAB and yeasts, decreasing availability of oxygen, and raising the pH). The temperature of the water is also cooler than that of the previous fermentation—and as we know from basic biology, lower temperatures result in slower metabolism of microorganisms (this is one of the main reasons that fridges help to stop spoilage).&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of this means that Kenyan coffee producers were able to extend the time that coffee sat in the tank prior to drying without risking spoilage—solving the issue of needing to make the wash cycle last long enough to wait for the previous load of laundry to come out of the drier.</p>



<p>But there was an unexpected benefit: as the washed, previously-fermented coffee sat in the tank, it was still microbially charged. Yeast like <em>Saccharomyces Cerevisiae</em>—a facultative anaerobe—would continue to replicate and produce alcohol underwater (though initially slower than before). With oxygen still readily available (whether dissolved in the water or through cellular oxygen), pH once again between 5-6 in the interstitial liquid, and with abundant ethanol from the previous and continuing fermentation, AAB once again kicked into gear and produced vinegar. Because it had to build population again, the initial rate of this production, though, would be low; and the water the coffee soaked in would mix with the vinegar produced by AAB and dilute it, meaning that the coffee would not spoil but would absorb just a small concentration of acetic acid from this production, while the other metabolites from the prior, dry fermentation redistributed and homogenized in the lot.</p>



<p>In low concentrations, humans perceive acetic acid as “fruity” or “floral” as well as quite sour. And in coffee, acetic acid is the only volatile organic acid present—helping to draw other volatile compounds in coffee toward the cupper and heightening the aromatic intensity of the coffee.</p>



<p>Much like the “signature” Kenyan profile.</p>



<p>But we’re not done: After the soak, the coffee would be put on raised beds in the sun in a thin layer to rapidly dry the surface water in a “pre dry” stage. This could very quickly—within a day or two—get the coffee down to ~45% moisture, accelerating the wet coffee through the most precarious stage of drying. The coffee would then be moved to the drying stage.</p>



<p>If there was not room on the drying beds, though, coffee that was partially dried—down to 20-24%—could be moved to a “holding pen” for up to several days—allowing the previous batch the opportunity to finish drying completely, and creating room on the skin drying tables for any incoming coffee exiting the soaking tanks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While this “holding” of partially dried coffee would have <em>less</em> of an impact on quality<em> </em>per se (though microbial activity would continue at a lower level, and likely modulate toward filamentous fungi and yeasts) it would create an opportunity for intracellular moisture in the coffee—which was abundant due to soaking, but unevenly distributed due to the pre-drying step—to redistribute and homogenize before the coffee completed drying. The benefits of interrupted or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://repositorio.unesp.br/bitstream/handle/11449/130295/WOS000350408000016.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y" target="_blank">intermittent drying</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.scielo.br/j/cagro/a/rCJyTYJSrwvkPhkKWhjHbsG/?format=pdf&amp;lang=en" target="_blank">resting periods during drying</a> have been well established—and this additional rest would, additionally, help to preserve and protect the coffee from fade by helping the coffee dry more uniformly after resting.</p>

<p>Over the last four years, I’ve noticed a change in the character of the coffees from the coops I bought from—coops of whose coffee I’ve been cupping since 2013 or 2014 and thought I knew quite well. The mix of cultivars hadn’t changed, and they were being processed at the same factories and mills and through the same marketing agents and exporters as before.</p>



<p>But a couple things had changed: their volume of exports had slowly decreased, and the premiums we’d paid toward improving the infrastructure at the factories, as far as we could tell, had not actually resulted in those improvements being made.</p>



<p>I noted that some changes were made to the way the coffee was processed. Because drying space was no longer in short supply—except perhaps for a short while at peak harvest—the holding pens weren’t in use anymore. The coffee went on the beds and stayed there. And of course, because in Kenya’s export system a coffee must first pass through a dry mill before auction and export, this means that unlike other countries—where coffee can be stored in parchment to homogenize or stabilize prior to final sale, it’s removed from its protective layer months before shipping and stored in warehouses without climate control dotting Nairobi. </p>



<p>If it doesn’t stabilize during drying—like in a holding pen—it would be more susceptible to fade, a phenomenon I have observed in the samples I’d tasted and Kenyan coffees I’d hoped to enjoy from other roasters.</p>



<p>And then there was the fermentation: the factories I bought from no longer practiced Kenya’s signature “secondary fermentation” or soak—and they insisted that they weren’t the only ones who’d given up the practice. I looked around, and—they were right.</p>



<p>All of those extra steps—an extra day or two in the tanks, an extra 4-5 days in drying—amount to extra costs.</p>



<p>And it’s not like the producers were getting paid more for the coffee, so—why bother?</p>



<p>At the dry mill, we faced similar volume-based conundrums. While lot sizes passing to auction might be anywhere from 1-100 bags, it was common for smaller lots to be aggregated into larger ones simply as a matter of cost efficiency. There’s “changeover” loss when mills switch between distinct lots—there’s coffee retained in the system as well as recalibrations that need to be performed. With larger mills—like those in Kenya and those that were endemic to Colombia until the last decade—the amount of loss was greater. This means that they perform more efficiently as larger lots pass through them.</p>



<p>Think of it like a coffee grinder: if your grinder retains or exchanges 2.3g of coffee every time you grind and your dose is 20g, every time you grind coffee you’re theoretically losing about 11% or adulterating the coffee you’re grinding with 11% of previous batches. But if you’re grinding 500g, loss or interjection of 2.3g is just 0.46%—hardly likely to have any significant impact on your cup, and acceptable levels of loss.</p>



<p>So if these mills need more coffee passing through them to create the Kenyan coffee we remember—and coffee production is in decline—what now?</p>



<hr>



<p>I’m pretty ambivalent about the notion of trying to buy coffee from any certain place, especially for something as increasingly available as quality. Every export system in the world functions with its own set of rules and challenges and possibilities. But Kenya’s challenges are decidedly in a class of their own.</p>



<p>I stopped working there not because I don’t love the coffee or think it’s too expensive—but because it’s too opaque, too indirect, too diffuse. </p>



<p>It’s impossible to develop an equitable relationship when it’s systematically, legally set up to be an extractive one.</p>



<p>Many of the quality challenges, I think, can be solved through appropriate economic and fiduciary mechanisms and policies. Further, small scale mills and micro mills like those in Colombia and those we’re starting to see in Ethiopia would help producers differentiate their own products as well as establish a level of traceability and separation not accessible through the current system. And liberalization efforts, like the proposed Coffee Bill 2021 under consideration by the parliament would reform many of the most egregious oversights that de facto legalize systemic corruption and the exploitation of producers today.</p>



<p>Ultimately, unless we can find ways to put more money in the hands of individual smallholders—by paying producers when an exporter takes custody, for example, and implementing financing mechanisms for producers at sustainably low interest rates, the question I asked at the outset still remains.</p>



<p>Why bother?</p>

<p><strong>[UPDATE 05 Jan 2022]</strong></p>



<p>A few days after I published this post, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/phil.magowao/" target="_blank">Philip Magowan</a>, a PhD candidate at University of Cambridge reached out. His research focus is on the coffee production in Kenya during the colonial period, and reading through his (unpublished) dissertation, the historical record establishes that the inequity in Kenya’s coffee production and export system is calculated, intentional, systemic and institutional in nature.</p>



<p>I look forward to linking to the dissertation when it’s published, but for now will leave you with a few paragraphs from his email:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As you may well know – British settlers sought to exclude Kenyan farmers from coffee production (and until the 1950s, they had largely succeeded in doing so). My MPhil thesis research investigated the role of quality in Kenya’s coffee production. I looked at how settlers used European ideas of quality-oriented coffee production to sustain the exclusion of Kenyans from coffee farming. The settlers established exclusionary coffee research facilities, credit services and even ensured that new railroads only serviced settler areas of coffee production.</p>



<p>In particular relation to your blog, when in the 1940s, the colonial government were discussing how the first Kenyan-produced coffee crops should be processed and marketed – the settler farmers proposed that coffee from the Kenyan smallholders should be processed together in larger consignments that ignored any distinction between individual farmers’ lots. In comparison, each settler estate was marketed in sacks marked with the name of the estate, and was processed as an individual lot. This process negated any value of an individual Kenyan smallholder’s efforts, and further disincentivised farmers from working to increase the quality of their coffee. As you have highlighted for the similar issue arising today –&nbsp;<em>why bother?</em></p>



<p>Indeed, one of Kenya’s agricultural officials at the time, trying to explain to the Kenya govt why these rules were unjust, noted ‘By pooling the lots into one consignment, the quality of the greatest farmer’s coffee is rendered no better than that of the worst; like a fleet of ships, progress of the whole is tied to the slowest vessel.’ It is interesting that a similar issue arises today, where to save money lots are processed together, though at the ultimate expense of quality.</p>



<p>When writing my thesis, some of the conclusions that you came to in your blog were also apparent to me. The institutional legacy of the coffee marketing structure in the colonial period has chronically pervaded the prevailing structures today. I have never felt like I understood the contemporary industry well enough to comment, but a rewrite of these institutions from a government level does seem to be the only solution. Businesses like ACR are doing a fantastic job but the co-ops are now too significant a social/welfare role to vanish completely from the lives of coffee farmers.</p>

                                        <p>SANTA CLARA, Calif., Dec. 2, 2024 – Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) today announced that CEO Pat Gelsinger retired from the company after a distinguished 40-plus-year career and has stepped down from the board of directors, effective Dec. 1, 2024.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Intel has named two senior leaders, <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/biographies/biography-david-zinsner.html">David Zinsner</a> and <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/biographies/biography-michelle-johnston-holthaus.html">Michelle (MJ) Johnston Holthaus</a>, as interim co-chief executive officers while the board of directors conducts a search for a new CEO. Zinsner is executive vice president and chief financial officer, and Holthaus has been appointed to the newly created position of CEO of Intel Products, a group that encompasses the company’s Client Computing Group (CCG), Data Center and AI Group (DCAI) and Network and Edge Group (NEX). Frank Yeary, independent chair of the board of Intel, will become interim executive chair during the period of transition. Intel Foundry leadership structure remains unchanged.</p>

<p>The board has formed a search committee and will work diligently and expeditiously to find a permanent successor to Gelsinger.</p>

<p>Yeary said, “On behalf of the board, I want to thank Pat for his many years of service and dedication to Intel across a long career in technology leadership. Pat spent his formative years at Intel, then returned at a critical time for the company in 2021. As a leader, Pat helped launch and revitalize process manufacturing by investing in state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing, while working tirelessly to drive innovation throughout the company.”</p>

<p>Yeary continued, “While we have made significant progress in regaining manufacturing competitiveness and building the capabilities to be a world-class foundry, we know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence. As a board, we know first and foremost that we must put our product group at the center of all we do. Our customers demand this from us, and we will deliver for them. With MJ’s permanent elevation to CEO of Intel Products along with her interim co-CEO role of Intel, we are ensuring the product group will have the resources needed to deliver for our customers. Ultimately, returning to process leadership is central to product leadership, and we will remain focused on that mission while driving greater efficiency and improved profitability.” &nbsp;</p>

<p>Yeary concluded, “With Dave and MJ’s leadership, we will continue to act with urgency on our priorities: simplifying and strengthening our product portfolio and advancing our manufacturing and foundry capabilities while optimizing our operating expenses and capital. We are working to create a leaner, simpler, more agile Intel.”</p>

<p>Gelsinger said, “Leading Intel has been the honor of my lifetime – this group of people is among the best and the brightest in the business, and I’m honored to call each and every one a colleague. Today is, of course, bittersweet as this company has been my life for the bulk of my working career. I can look back with pride at all that we have accomplished together.&nbsp;It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics. I am forever grateful for the many colleagues around the world who I have worked with as part of the Intel family.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Throughout Gelsinger’s tenure at Intel across a variety of roles, he has driven significant innovation and advanced not only the business but the broader global technology industry. A highly respected leader and skilled technologist, he has played an instrumental role in focusing on innovation while also creating a sense of urgency throughout the organization. Gelsinger began his career in 1979 at Intel, growing at the company to eventually become its first chief technology officer.</p>

<p>Zinsner and Holthaus said, “We are grateful for Pat’s commitment to Intel over these many years as well as his leadership. We will redouble our commitment to Intel Products and meeting customer needs. With our product and process leadership progressing, we will be focused on driving returns on foundry investments.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zinsner has more than 25 years of financial and operational experience in semiconductors, manufacturing and the technology industry. He joined Intel in January 2022 from Micron Technology Inc., where he was executive vice president and CFO. Zinsner served in a variety of other leadership roles earlier in his career, including president and chief operating officer at Affirmed Networks and senior vice president of finance and CFO at Analog Devices.</p>

<p>Holthaus is a proven general manager and leader who began her career with Intel nearly three decades ago. Prior to being named CEO of Intel Products, she was executive vice president and general manager of CCG. Holthaus has held a variety of management and leadership roles at Intel, including chief revenue officer and general manager of the Sales and Marketing Group, and lead of global CCG sales.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Performance</strong><br>
Lower latency, higher throughput, lower cost &amp; energy consumption, esp. for multi-field and concurrent queries.<br>
Low tail latencies ensure a smooth user experience and prevent loss of customers and revenue.<br>
While some rely on proprietary hardware accelerators (FPGA/ASIC) or clusters to improve performance,<br>
SeekStorm achieves a similar boost algorithmically on a single commodity server.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Consistency</strong><br>
No unpredictable query latency during and after large-volume indexing as SeekStorm doesn't require resource-intensive segment merges.<br>
Stable latencies - no cold start costs due to just-in-time compilation, no unpredictable garbage collection delays.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Scaling</strong><br>
Maintains low latency, high throughput, and low RAM consumption even for billion-scale indices.<br>
Unlimited field number, field length &amp; index size.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Relevance</strong><br>
Term proximity ranking provides more relevant results compared to BM25.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Real-time</strong><br>
True real-time search, as opposed to NRT: every indexed document is immediately searchable, even before and during commit.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>Search speed might be good enough for a single search. Below &lt;10 ms people can't tell latency anymore. Search latency might be small compared to internet network latency.</li>
<li>But search engine performance still matters when used in a server or service for many concurrent users and requests for maximum scaling, and throughput, and low processor load, cost.</li>
<li>With performant search technology you can serve many concurrent users, at low latency with fewer servers, less cost, and less energy consumption, lower carbon footprint.</li>
<li>It also ensures low latency even for complex and challenging queries: instant search, fuzzy search, faceted search, and union/intersection/phrase of very frequent terms.</li>
<li>Besides average latencies we also need to reduce tail latencies, which are often overlooked, but can cause loss of customers, and revenue and can cause a bad user experience.</li>
<li>It is always advisable to engineer your search infrastructure with enough performance headroom, to keep those tail latencies in check, even on periods of high concurrent load.</li>
<li>Also, even if a human user might not notice the latency, it still might make a big difference in autonomous stock market, defense applications or RAG which requires multiple queries.</li>

<p dir="auto">Despite what the hype-cycles <a href="https://www.bitecode.dev/p/hype-cycles" rel="nofollow">https://www.bitecode.dev/p/hype-cycles</a> want you to believe, keyword search is not dead, as NoSQL wasn't the death of SQL.</p>

<p dir="auto">Keyword search is just a filter for a set of documents, returning those where certain keywords occur in, usually combined with a ranking metric like BM25.
A very basic and core functionality, that is very challenging to implement at scale with low latency.
Because the functionality is so basic, there is an unlimited number of application fields.
It is a component, to be used together with other components.
There are uses cases which can be solved better today with vector search and LLMs, but for many more keyword search is still the best solution.
Keyword search is exact, lossless, and it is very fast, with better scaling, better latency, lower cost and energy consumption.
Vector search works with semantic similarity, returning results within with a given proximity and probability.</p>

<p dir="auto">If you search for exact results like proper names, numbers, license plates, domain names, and phrases (e.g. plagiarism detection) then keyword search is your friend. Vector search on the other hand will bury the exact result that you are looking for among a myriad results that are only somehow semantically related. At the same time, if you don’t know the exact terms, or you are interested in a broader topic, meaning or synonym, no matter what exact terms are used, then keyword search will fail you.</p>

<p dir="auto">Facets are defined in 3 different places:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>the facet fields are defined in schema at create_index,</li>
<li>the facet field values are set in index_document at index time,</li>
<li>the query_facets/facet_filter parameters are specified at query time.<br>
Facets are then returned in the search result object.</li>

<p>I am grateful to the journalist Tom Webb, who specialises in data protection, for alerting me to <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/Publications/57084/Documents/5415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an amendment to the Data (Use and Access) Bill</a>, currently going through the House of Lords.</p>



<p>It concerns the legal presumption that “mechanical instruments” (which seems to be taken to include computer networks) are working properly if they look to the user like they’re working properly. This has come in for quite a kicking in recent years. I was <a href="http://becarefulwhatyouwishfornickwallis.blogspot.com/2013/08/post-office-2nd-sight-report-into.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first alerted to it in 2013</a> by the barrister Stephen Mason. </p>



<p>Mason has spent longer than a decade telling anyone who will listen it is a deeply flawed legal presumption. <a href="https://read.uolpress.co.uk/read/3a219939-14d3-45c9-9fe0-9b42298ac587/section/0f113452-78ad-4c82-b28f-08cff1877036" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Here he sets out his reasoning</a>. Mason has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/12/update-law-on-computer-evidence-to-avoid-horizon-repeat-ministers-urged" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won some influential supporters</a> along the way, including Lord (James) Arbuthnot who has also spent longer than a decade campaigning on behalf of Subpostmasters affected by the Post Office scandal.</p>



<p>Although the “mechanical instruments” presumption has never, to the best of my knowledge, been quoted in any civil or criminal proceedings involving a Subpostmaster, it has been said to effectively reverse the burden of proof on anyone who might be convicted using digital evidence. </p>



<p>The logic being if the courts are going to assume a computer was working fine at the time an offence allegedly occurred because it looked like it was working fine, it is then down to the defendant to prove that it was <em>not</em> working fine. This can be extremely difficult to do (per the Seema Misra/Lee Castleton cases).  </p>



<p><a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/Publications/57084/Documents/5415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This is the amendment proposed</a> by Lord Arbuthnot and others. I am grateful to Tom for bringing it to my attention. It says:</p>



<p>After Clause 132, insert the following new Clause – </p>



<p>“<strong>Reliability of computer-based evidence</strong></p>



<p>(1) Electronic evidence produced by or derived from a computer, device or computer system (separately or together “system”) is admissible as evidence in any proceedings –</p>



<p>(a) where that electronic evidence and the reliability of the system that produced it or from which it is derived are not challenged;<br>(b) where the court is satisfied that the reliability of the system cannot reasonably be challenged;<br>(c) where the court is satisfied that the electronic evidence is derived from a reliable system.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="498" src="https://www.postofficescandal.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20210423-Lord-Arbuthnot-outside-RCJ-1024x498.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.postofficescandal.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20210423-Lord-Arbuthnot-outside-RCJ-1024x498.jpg 1024w, https://www.postofficescandal.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20210423-Lord-Arbuthnot-outside-RCJ-300x146.jpg 300w, https://www.postofficescandal.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20210423-Lord-Arbuthnot-outside-RCJ-768x373.jpg 768w, https://www.postofficescandal.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20210423-Lord-Arbuthnot-outside-RCJ-1536x747.jpg 1536w, https://www.postofficescandal.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/20210423-Lord-Arbuthnot-outside-RCJ-2048x996.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>James Arbuthnot</figcaption></figure>



<p>(2) Rules of Court must provide that electronic evidence sought to be relied upon by a party in any proceedings may be challenged by another party as to its admissibility.</p>



<p>(3) For the purposes of subsection (1)(b), Rules of Court must provide for the circumstances in which the Court may be satisfied that the admissibility of electronic evidence cannot reasonably be challenged.</p>



<p>(4) When determining whether a system is reliable for the purposes of subsection (1)(c) the matters that may be taken into account include –</p>



<p>(a) any instructions or rules of the system that apply to its operation;<br>(b) any measures taken to secure the integrity of data held on the system;<br>(c) any measures taken to prevent unauthorised access to and use of the system;<br>(d) the security of the hardware and software used by the system;<br>(e) any measures taken to monitor and assess the reliability of the system by the system controller or operator including steps taken to fix errors or address unexpected outcomes including the regularity of and extent of any audit of the system by an independent body;<br>(f) any assessment of the reliability of the system made by a body with supervisory or regulatory functions;<br>(g) the provisions of any scheme or industry standard that apply in relation<br>to the system.</p>



<p>(5) For the purposes of this section – </p>



<p>“<em>computer</em>” means any device capable of performing mathematical or logical instructions;<br>“<em>device</em>” means any apparatus or tool operating alone or connected to other apparatus or tools, that processes information or data in electronic form;<br>“<em>electronic evidence</em>” means evidence derived from data contained in or produced by any device the functioning of which depends on a software program or from data stored on a computer, device or computer system or communicated over a networked computer system.”</p>



<p><em><strong>Member’s explanatory statement</strong><br>This amendment overturns the current legal assumption that evidence from computers is always reliable which has contributed to miscarriages of justice including the Horizon Scandal. It enables courts to ask questions of those submitting computer evidence about its reliability.</em></p>
