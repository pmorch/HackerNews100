        <p><img src="http://twitchard.github.io/images/dropCapA.jpg" alt="A">bout nine months ago, I requested a transfer to the team working on the company’s CI tooling. In my judgement, CI was a major productivity blocker for the whole organization, and I hoped I would be able to help improve it and make a broad, positive impact.</p>
<p>At that time, CI was in Jenkins 1, which had three major problems:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Everybody’s CI pipeline was described in text boxes in the Jenkins UI, which meant they were not version controlled, discoverable, and editing/testing new configurations was a difficult experience.</p></li>
<li><p>The web interface was dated and unpleasant to use.</p></li>
<li><p>Developers had little control over the environment in which their jobs ran, because the VMs operating as Jenkins nodes were centrally managed.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>My team considered two options.</p>
<h3 id="option-1-switch-tools">Option 1: Switch tools</h3>
<p>The head of SRE championed Gitlab CI. I resisted this idea because I, the relatively inexperienced manager of a nascent team, was daunted by the prospect of trying to supplant Jenkins, Github, and JIRA all at once.</p>
<p>On a previous team I had used Concourse CI to some extent, but I wasn’t really blown away by the experience. Travis and Circle were mentioned. I was a fool. I should have committed to seriously researching some of the contenders and making a more informed decision, but I lacked the willpower and the discernment.</p>
<h3 id="option-2-upgrade-to-jenkins-2">Option 2: Upgrade to Jenkins 2</h3>
<p>On the face of it, Jenkins 2 seemed to meet all our needs. It:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Supports defining your CI job as a “declarative pipeline” that can live as a Jenkinsfile in the root of your repository. Hooray configuration as code!</p></li>
<li><p>Boasts a UX facelift called “Blue Ocean” that looks more modern.</p></li>
<li><p>Permits pipelines to request to be run on a docker “agent”, which lets application developers control the environment on which their job is run by specifying a Docker image or Dockerfile.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="a-taxonomy-of-mistakes">A Taxonomy of Mistakes</h2>
<p>The worst mistakes come in two distinct flavors: catastrophic and insidious.</p>
<p>A catastrophic mistake is like triggering an outage, or deleting production data. The moment you realize what you’ve done is the worst single moment in your career. Your heart pounds in your chest. Is this a nightmare? Maybe in a second, you will wake up? No, it’s real. Hopefully, you’ve got a healthy culture at work, and you desperately describe the situation to your teammates, who rally to your side. Somebody with a cool head thinks of some way to make the best of things, and somehow – maybe that night, maybe the next day – you make it through. Things go back to normal. You write a postmortem, count your losses, and go back to work – a little less innocent, and a little wiser.</p>
<p>An insidious mistake, by contrast, does not reveal itself in a moment. It makes you suffer a little bit here, and a little bit there, until one day you wake up and you realize that there is a gaping hole where your humanity used to be. You are a miserable husk of a man, with cruelty on your lips and bile in your heart. You still greet your colleagues with that jolly smile of yours – but the sweetness in your smile is the saccharine of cynicism, not the honeyed optimism as it was in the days before, when life was cheerful and your burden was light. The light in your eyes used to be the hope for a better tomorrow. Now it is the glint of madness.</p>
<h2 id="whats-wrong-with-jenkins">What’s wrong with Jenkins</h2>
<p>Choosing Jenkins was the insidious kind of mistake. Warning – I’m going to rant for many, many paragraphs. My advice is to skim.</p>
<p>The worst thing about Jenkins is that it works. It can meet your needs. With a liiittle more effort, or by adopting sliiiightly lower standards, or with a liiiiitle more tolerance for pain, you can always get Jenkins to do aaaaalmost what you want it to. But let’s talk specifics. Jenkins features:</p>
<h3 id="high-indirection-between-you-and-the-execution-of-your-code.">High indirection between you and the execution of your code.</h3>
<p>For me, the bulk of the actual work of a CI pipeline takes the form of shell commands. are typically executed inside shell commands. In Jenkins pipeline, there is a ‘sh’ “step” that executes the shell. For example</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1">  sh <span>'npm install'</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2">  sh <span>'make'</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>So instead of writing Bash directly, you’re writing Bash inside Groovy. But:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your editor won’t syntax highlight the Bash inside Groovy.</li>
<li>You can’t run “shellcheck” (or any sort of Linter) on the Bash inside the groovy.</li>
<li>You can’t very easily execute your shell commands to test them.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two ways to try and address this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Write your shell in a separate Bash file that you execute from Groovy, avoid putting it inline in your pipeline.</li>
<li>Try to avoid writing shell at all – instead, implement everything as Groovy methods.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think #1 is actually the better approach. We started out there. The trouble was, we started wanting to abstract our pipeline steps and turn them into “shared libraries” and so we gravitated toward #2, so that we could share steps easily across pipelines.</p>
<p>The trouble is: Groovy is a much, much worse language for executing commands than Bash. Bash is interpreted, has a REPL that is great for experimentation, does require a ton of imports, and has lightweight syntax. Groovy has none of these things. The way that developers test their Groovy steps is by triggering a job on the remote Jenkins server to run them. The feedback loop is 2 orders of magnitude slower than it is for just executing Bash locally.</p>
<p>Are there ways to execute the Groovy steps locally? The way you’re supposed to do it is with <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/JenkinsPipelineUnit">JenkinsPipelineUnit</a> which is a very good idea – it lets you write unit tests against your Jenkins Pipeline, and gives you an interface for mocking various Jenkins things. But there are two problems:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>As noted in the README, Groovy doesn’t run the same way on Jenkins as it does in your unit test, because the groovy DSL is “serialized” by Jenkins before running.</li>
<li>“Declarative” pipelines <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/JenkinsPipelineUnit/issues/10">are not supported</a> – a huge problem for us, since that’s how we’ve implemented all our stuff, since it seemed to be the newest and most modern thing to be doing.</li>
</ol>
<p>So basically, that’s a huge bust. Especially since we were not a Java shop. My team was barely able to kind of piece this together because it’s our job to work on the CI system, but there is absolutely no way that any of the PHP/Javascript/Golang/Python application developers who need to write pipelines will be able to download Gradle, figure out they need to run gradle init, install the pipeline unit testing library, figure out the proper way to initialize the “PipelineTestHelper”.</p>
<p>So we’re basically resigned to the workflow of running shell commands defined in methods used by a DSL embedded in groovy transmitted to the CI master node, serialized and passed to a CI worker node and executed there.</p>
<p>There’s a “replay script” feature that lets you edit your pipeline right in the web interface, which helps cut down on the feedback time a little bit if you don’t care about version controlling your changes or being able to use your own editor/tools. I personally am not willing to make that sacrifice.</p>
<p>TL;DR, the feedback loop sucks. You’ll never be able to effectively test any of the code running in your pipeline. Your best bet is to build it all entirely in Bash, build your own mechanism for testing it and sharing functionality. The ability to write Groovy shared libraries is a trap and leads only to misery.</p>
<h3 id="low-level-of-discoverability">Low level of discoverability</h3>
<p>A lot of functionality that Jenkins has in the web UI – especially the functionality that comes through plugins – is also possible to define in pipelines, but the means for doing this is not well-documented. For example, there’s this <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/throttle-concurrent-builds-plugin">plugin</a> that permits you to “throttle” a job so that multiple jobs don’t fire at once. that you can see inside the UI. After probably half a day of Googling, trial and error, and thanks to a stroke of luck, I figured out that I could accomplish what I wanted by putting the following in my Jenkinsfile:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>properties</span><span>([[</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2">        $class<span>:</span> <span>'ThrottleJobProperty'</span><span>,</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3">        maxConcurrentTotal<span>:</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4">        throttleEnabled<span>:</span> <span>true</span><span>,</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5">        throttleOption<span>:</span> <span>'project'</span></span>
<span id="cb2-6"><span>]])</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Maybe if I were a Java/Groovy expert I could have read the source code for the plugin and determined this was possible. But I shouldn’t have to be. And the application developers trying to implement their own pipelines for there code <em>definitely</em> shouldn’t have to be.</p>
<p>There are two tricks I’ve developed to help the discovery of these magic incantations. Trick 1 is the “Snippet Generator”, which is basically a drop down box in the Jenkins UI with a pretty comprehensive list of options to explore and can help you find what you need maybe 15% of the time. Even if you can’t produce something usable, the snippet generator can give you an idea what to Google for.</p>
<p>Trick 2 I’ve had much more success with. Use the snippet generator or Google things just enough to find a function name or keyword relevant to whatever you’re trying to do. Then, go to <code>github.com/search</code> and put <code>filename:Jenkinsfile &lt;keyword&gt;</code>. You’ll probably find something you can copy and paste. It’s worked 90% of the time, for me.</p>
<p>Really, this experience sucks. I don’t really do any sort of other engineering like that, because sane systems have better documentation, more obvious abstractions, and better interactivity. I feel like a script kiddie, blindly typing incantations in to make magic happen through trial and error. Hugely demoralizing.</p>
<h3 id="blue-ocean-is-incomplete-and-unintuitive">Blue Ocean is Incomplete and Unintuitive</h3>
<p>Blue Ocean looks more modern than the classic Jenkins UI – I’ll give it that. Unfortunately, it’s missing functionality, so you’ll have to use and become familiar with the classic Jenkins UI anyway. It’s also just not a pleasant UI to use! I’m not much of a design person or a front-end developer, so I can’t articulate precisely what it is that makes the interface unpleasant, but it always seems to take several clicks in places I don’t expect in order to do what I’m trying to do – usually, I just want to run the build, or see the output of the build.</p>
<h3 id="docker">Docker</h3>
<p>It is possible to have your builds run inside docker containers. Jenkins 2 does let the job author specify a docker image, or dockerfile – even kubernetes configurations for autoscaling! So, in principle, the problem of letting job authors own their job’s environment is solved.</p>
<p>The only problem is that this problem is solved by incorporating the idea of a “Jenkins worker” INTO the idea of a Docker container. These two ideas don’t always play well together. For example, one thing I kind of expected/hoped for was that, defining a Jenkinsfile to use a Dockerfile, and then giving it a build step like</p>

<p>would be approximately the same thing as</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>docker</span> build . <span>-t</span> foo</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><span>docker</span> run foo make test</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But it different in one very significant way. With <code>docker run</code>, your cwd is whatever the Dockerfile defined. In a Jenkins job, the cwd is the Jenkins workspace – which is bind mounted in from the host node. Basically, Jenkins tries to <em>turn your docker container</em> into a regular old Jenkins worker. This makes a degree of sense, but has a number of inconveniences.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You probably can’t be root inside your docker container. If your build produces any sort of persistent artifact in the workspace, that artifact will be owned by root and will end up on the filesystem of the host. Jenkins on the host doesn’t run as root, so it doesn’t have permissions to wipe the workspace when it needs to, and you’ll get janky permissions errors.</li>
</ol>
<p>So what we ended up doing is creating a user inside the dockerfile with the same UID as the user that Jenkins runs as. Passed through via a build arg. This is not something I’d really mind doing once – but you have to do this trick for <em>every single job</em> that is defined. So it’s not just something we could solve for everybody on the CI team. Every application developer who wanted to define their own job ran up against this problem. And it’s a confusing problem – it took me days to really make sense of what Jenkins was trying to do. We documented it internally about as well as we could, but still we ended up guiding probably at least a dozen application developers through this particular confusion.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>You’re probably going to have to define a docker image <em>just</em> for the build.</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the mostly-false promises of Docker, as it was sold to me by the true believers who introduced me to it, was that, if you do it right, you can run the same docker image, and therefore have basically the same environment in production, in CI, and on your local development machine. I’ve never actually see this happen, but I can tell you right now – you’re going to have to define a special docker image just for Jenkins, because of how strangely it interacts with the world of containers.</p>
<p>Lest this turn into a rant against Docker – a tool I am also seriously disappointed with, I’ll end here. Long story short, we used Jenkins 2. It kind of solved our problems. So now our problems are kind of solved, which is the worst kind of solved.</p>
<h3 id="postlude">Postlude</h3>
<p>It’s a month after I started writing this post. Now I work at a different, bigger company. I no longer work on CI. What’s more, one of the principles I had never even thought to question at my old company – “everybody should be writing and maintaining their own CI jobs” – is just not at play here. There’s a team that seems almost completely to own CI and all CI jobs. I’m in week 4, and I know Jenkins is there, somewhere, lurking behind the scenes. But I have never interacted with it, and it seems like there are a lot of smart people working so that I never, ever need to. What a strange new world this is.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Sam Altman was reinstated soon after being <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sam-altman-officially-returns-to-openai-board-seat-microsoft/">fired as OpenAI CEO</a> last month, but still stood to gain had the company continued to develop <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a> without him. During Altman’s tenure as CEO, OpenAI signed a letter of intent to spend $51 million on AI chips from a startup called Rain AI into which he has also invested personally.</p><p>Rain is based less than a mile from OpenAI’s headquarters in San Francisco and is working on a chip it calls a <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2013/12/16/174934/thinking-in-silicon/">neuromorphic</a> processing unit, or NPU, designed to <a data-offer-url="https://johnkoetsier.com/artificial-brain-neuromorphic-chip/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://johnkoetsier.com/artificial-brain-neuromorphic-chip/&quot;}" href="https://johnkoetsier.com/artificial-brain-neuromorphic-chip/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">replicate features of the human brain</a>. OpenAI in 2019 signed a nonbinding agreement to spend $51 million on the chips when they became available, according to a copy of the deal and Rain disclosures to investors this year seen by WIRED. Rain told investors Altman had personally invested more than $1 million into the company. The letter of intent has not been previously reported.</p><p>The investor documents said that Rain could get its first hardware to customers as early as October next year. OpenAI and Rain declined to comment.</p><div><p>OpenAI’s letter of intent with Rain shows how Altman’s web of personal investments can entangle with his duties as OpenAI CEO. His prior position leading startup incubator Y Combinator helped Altman become one of Silicon Valley’s most prominent dealmakers, investing in dozens of startups and acting as a broker between entrepreneurs and the world’s biggest companies. But the distraction and intermingling of his myriad pursuits played some role in his recent <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/openai-ceo-sam-altman-is-out-after-losing-confidence-of-board/">firing</a> by OpenAI’s board for uncandid communications, according to people involved in the situation but not authorized to discuss it.</p><p>The Rain deal also underscores OpenAI’s willingness to spend large sums to secure supplies of chips needed to underpin pioneering AI projects. Altman has complained publicly of a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/dd9ba2f6-f509-42f0-8e97-4271c7b84ded">“brutal crunch”</a> for AI chips and their <a data-offer-url="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1599669571795185665" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/sama/status/1599669571795185665&quot;}" href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1599669571795185665" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">“eye-watering”</a> costs. OpenAI taps the powerful cloud of Microsoft, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-emerges-as-the-winner-in-openai-chaos/">its primary investor</a>, but has regularly shut off access to features of ChatGPT due to hardware constraints. According to a blog post about a closed door meeting he held with developers, Altman <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blog-post-detailed-sam-altman-142219663.html">has said</a> the pace of AI progress may be dependent on new chip designs and supply chains.</p></div><p>Rain touted its progress to potential investors earlier this year, projecting that as soon as this month it could “tape out” a test chip, a standard milestone in chip development referring to a design ready for fabrication. But the startup also has recently reshuffled its leadership and investors after reportedly an interagency US government body that polices investments for national security risks mandated Saudi Arabia-affiliated fund Prosperity7 Ventures to sell its stake in the company. The fund led a $25 million fundraise <a data-offer-url="https://www.aramco.com/en/news-media/news/2022/aramco-announces-prosperity7-ventures" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.aramco.com/en/news-media/news/2022/aramco-announces-prosperity7-ventures&quot;}" href="https://www.aramco.com/en/news-media/news/2022/aramco-announces-prosperity7-ventures" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> by Rain in early 2022.</p><p>The forced removal of the fund, first <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-30/us-compels-saudi-fund-to-exit-ai-chip-startup-backed-by-altman">reported by Bloomberg</a> Thursday and described in the documents seen by WIRED, could add to Rain’s challenges of bringing a novel chip technology to market, potentially delaying the day OpenAI can make good on its $51 million advance order. Silicon Valley-based <a data-offer-url="https://www.grepvc.com/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.grepvc.com/&quot;}" href="https://www.grepvc.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Grep VC</a> acquired the shares; it and the Saudi fund did not respond to requests for comment.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>US concern about Prosperity7’s deal with Rain also raises questions about another effort by Altman to increase the world’s supply of AI chips. He’s talked to investors in the Middle East in recent months about raising money to start a new chip company to help OpenAI and others diversify beyond their current reliance on Nvidia GPUs and specialized chips from Google, Amazon, and a few smaller suppliers, according to two people seeking anonymity to discuss private talks.</p><p>Brain Trust</p><p>Rain, founded in 2017, has claimed that its brain-inspired NPUs will yield potentially 100 times more computing power and, for training, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gordonhirschwilson_activity-difference-training-of-deep-neural-activity-7000595097717260288-pF04/">10,000 times</a> greater energy efficiency than GPUs, the graphics chips that are the workhorses for AI developers such as OpenAI and primarily sourced from Nvidia.</p><p>Altman led one of Rain’s seed financings in 2018, the company has said, the year before OpenAI committed to spend $51 million on its chips. Rain now has about 40 employees, including experts in both development of AI algorithms and traditional chip design, according the disclosures.</p><p>The startup appears to have quietly changed its CEO this year and now lists founding CEO Gordon Wilson as executive advisor on its website, with former white-shoe law firm attorney William Passo gaining a promotion to CEO from COO.</p><p>Wilson confirmed his exit in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7135990941244411904/">a LinkedIn post</a> Thursday, but did not provide a reason. “Rain is poised to build a product that will define new AI chip markets and massively disrupt existing ones,” he wrote. “Moving forward I will continue to help Rain in every way I can.” Over 400 LinkedIn users including some whose profiles say they are Rain employees commented on Wilson's post or reacted to it with heart or thumbs up emojis—Passo wasn't among them. Wilson declined to comment for this story.</p><p>The company will search for an industry veteran to permanently replace Wilson, according to an October note to investors seen by WIRED.</p><p>Rain’s initial chips <a data-offer-url="https://rain.ai/approach" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://rain.ai/approach&quot;}" href="https://rain.ai/approach" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">are based</a> on the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/using-open-source-designs-to-create-more-specialized-chips/">RISC-V open-source architecture</a> endorsed by Google, Qualcomm, and other tech companies and aimed at what the tech industry calls edge devices, located far from data centers, such as phones, drones, cars, and robots. Rain aims to provide a chip capable of both training machine algorithms and running them once they’re ready for deployment. Most edge chip designs today, like <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-apple-makes-ai-chip-powering-iphones-fancy-tricks/">those found in smartphones</a>, focus on the latter, known as inference. How OpenAI would use Rain chips could not be learned.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Rain at one point has claimed to investors that it has held advanced talks to sell systems to Google, Oracle, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon.

<p>In a preprint <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20216">research paper</a> titled "Does GPT-4 Pass the Turing Test?", two researchers from UC San Diego pitted OpenAI's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/openai-announces-gpt-4-its-next-generation-ai-language-model/">GPT-4</a> AI language model against human participants, GPT-3.5, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA">ELIZA</a> to see which could trick participants into thinking it was human with the greatest success. But along the way, the study, which has not been peer-reviewed, found that human participants correctly identified other humans in only 63 percent of the interactions—and that a 1960s computer program surpassed the AI model that powers the free version of ChatGPT.</p>

<p>Even with limitations and caveats, which we'll cover below, the paper presents a thought-provoking comparison between AI model approaches and raises further questions about using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">Turing test</a> to evaluate AI model performance.</p>
<p>British mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing first conceived the Turing test as "The Imitation Game" <a href="http://phil415.pbworks.com/f/TuringComputing.pdf">in 1950</a>. Since then, it has become a famous but controversial benchmark for determining a machine's ability to imitate human conversation. In modern versions of the test, a human judge typically talks to either another human or a chatbot without knowing which is which. If the judge cannot reliably tell the chatbot from the human a certain percentage of the time, the chatbot is said to have passed the test. The threshold for passing the test is subjective, so there has never been a broad consensus on what would constitute a passing success rate.</p>
<p>In the recent study, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20216">listed on arXiv</a> at the end of October, UC San Diego researchers Cameron Jones (a PhD student in Cognitive Science) and Benjamin Bergen (a professor in the university's Department of Cognitive Science) set up a website called <a href="https://turingtest.live/">turingtest.live</a>, where they hosted a two-player implementation of the Turing test over the Internet with the goal of seeing how well GPT-4, when prompted different ways, could convince people it was human.</p>

Ancient rules-based ELIZA outperformed GPT-3.5.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Through the site, human interrogators interacted with various "AI witnesses" representing either other humans or AI models that included the aforementioned GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA">ELIZA</a>, a rules-based conversational program from the 1960s. "The two participants in human matches were randomly assigned to the interrogator and witness roles," write the researchers. "Witnesses were instructed to convince the interrogator that they were human. Players matched with AI models were always interrogators."</p>
<p>The experiment involved 652 participants who completed a total of 1,810 sessions, of which 1,405 games were analyzed after excluding certain scenarios like repeated AI games (leading to the expectation of AI model interactions when other humans weren't online) or personal acquaintance between participants and witnesses, who were sometimes sitting in the same room.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, ELIZA, developed in the mid-1960s by computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT, scored relatively well during the study, achieving a success rate of 27 percent. GPT-3.5, depending on the prompt, scored a 14 percent success rate, below ELIZA. GPT-4 achieved a success rate of 41 percent, second only to actual humans.</p>
<p>GPT-3.5, the base model behind the free version of ChatGPT, has been conditioned by OpenAI specifically not to present itself as a human, which <a href="https://x.com/emollick/status/1728899736609149287?s=20">may partially account</a> for its poor performance. In a post on X, Princeton computer science professor Arvind Narayanan <a href="https://x.com/random_walker/status/1729115756439511119?s=20">wrote</a>, "Important context about the 'ChatGPT doesn't pass the Turing test' paper. As always, testing behavior doesn't tell us about capability." In a <a href="https://x.com/random_walker/status/1729145124561797199?s=20">reply</a>, he continued, "ChatGPT is fine-tuned to have a formal tone, not express opinions, etc, which makes it less humanlike. The authors tried to change this with the prompt, but it has limits. The best way to pretend to be a human chatting is to fine-tune on human chat logs."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Further, the authors speculate about the reasons for ELIZA's relative success in the study:</p>
<blockquote><p>"First, ELIZA’s responses tend to be conservative. While this generally leads to the impression of an uncooperative interlocutor, it prevents the system from providing explicit cues such as incorrect information or obscure knowledge. Second, ELIZA does not exhibit the kind of cues that interrogators have come to associate with assistant LLMs, such as being helpful, friendly, and verbose. Finally, some interrogators reported thinking that ELIZA was “too bad” to be a current AI model, and therefore was more likely to be a human intentionally being uncooperative."</p></blockquote>
<p>During the sessions, the most common strategies used by interrogators included small talk and questioning about knowledge and current events. More successful strategies involved speaking in a non-English language, inquiring about time or current events, and directly accusing the witness of being an AI model.</p>
<p>The participants made their judgments based on the responses they received. Interestingly, the study found that participants based their decisions primarily on linguistic style and socio-emotional traits, rather than the perception of intelligence alone. Participants noted when responses were too formal or informal, or when responses lacked individuality or seemed generic. The study also showed that participants' education and familiarity with large language models (LLMs) did not significantly predict their success in detecting AI.</p>

<p>The study's authors acknowledge the study's limitations, including potential sample bias by recruiting from social media and the lack of incentives for participants, which may have led to some people not fulfilling the desired role. They also say their results (especially the performance of ELIZA) may support common criticisms of the Turing test as an inaccurate way to measure machine intelligence. "Nevertheless," they write, "we argue that the test has ongoing relevance as a framework to measure fluent social interaction and deception, and for understanding human strategies to adapt to these devices."</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in many tasks, much about their inner workings remains unclear. In this study, we present novel experimental insights into the resilience of LLMs, particularly GPT-4, when subjected to extensive character-level permutations. To investigate this, we first propose the Scrambled Bench, a suite designed to measure the capacity of LLMs to handle scrambled input, in terms of both recovering scrambled sentences and answering questions given scrambled context. The experimental results indicate that most powerful LLMs demonstrate the capability akin to typoglycemia, a phenomenon where humans can understand the meaning of words even when the letters within those words are scrambled, as long as the first and last letters remain in place. More surprisingly, we found that only GPT-4 nearly flawlessly processes inputs with unnatural errors, even under the extreme condition, a task that poses significant challenges for other LLMs and often even for humans. Specifically, GPT-4 can almost perfectly reconstruct the original sentences from scrambled ones, decreasing the edit distance by 95%, even when all letters within each word are entirely scrambled. It is counter-intuitive that LLMs can exhibit such resilience despite severe disruption to input tokenization caused by scrambled text.

<p>The discovery will enable researchers to better understand eye movement disorders that cause significant visual impairment.</p>

<p><em>Article by <a href="https://vision.berkeley.edu/people/emily-ward/">Emily L Ward</a></em></p>

<p><span>H</span>erbert Wertheim School of Optometry &amp; Vision Science researchers have discovered rare neurons in the eye that are crucial for  our visual system to maintain a sharp, steady image of the world. These findings will impact our understanding of the human retina and likely provide insights into the pathology of eye movement disorders.</p>
<p>The study, recently published in <em>Nature</em>, was led by Teresa Puthussery, OD, PhD, an assistant professor at the Herbert Wertheim School of Optometry &amp; Vision Science and the <a href="https://neuroscience.berkeley.edu/">Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute</a>. First author, Anna Yao Mei Wang, PhD, is a postdoctoral scholar in <a href="https://www.retinalab.berkeley.edu/">The Puthussery Lab</a>. </p>

<h2>Gaze Stabilization in a Moving World</h2>
<p>The neurons identified are involved in a fundamental feature of everyday vision. As one walks down a busy street or looks out the window of a train, the gaze stabilization system operates below our conscious awareness causing the eyes to reflexively follow the direction in which the visual scene is moving. This visual mechanism works in concert with the vestibular system to maintain a sharp image of a moving world. Clinical conditions that interfere with gaze stabilization can therefore lead to significant visual impairment.</p>
<p>The new findings demonstrate for the first time that retinal neurons underlying gaze stabilization in other mammals are also present in primates, including humans. Neurons that send visual signals from the eye to the brain are called retinal ganglion cells. In humans, there are around 20 different retinal ganglion cell types, each of which responds to specific features of the visual scene, such as form, color, and motion (1–3).</p>

<p>The researchers discovered a highly-specialized retinal ganglion cell type known as direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs). They respond to motion in the visual field by increasing their activity when movement occurs in their “preferred” direction, while showing little activity to motion in the opposite direction. Collectively, responses from these neurons tell the gaze stabilization system which way the visual scene is moving.</p>
<p>“This cell type in particular—the direction-selective ganglion cell—had not been discovered previously in primate despite concerted effort, leading the field to conclude it must not be there,” said Marla Feller, PhD, a distinguished professor at UC Berkeley and an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences. Dr. Feller is an expert in retinal circuit development and function. </p>

<h2>Finding the Needle in the Haystack</h2>
<p>DSGCs were discovered in the rabbit retina in 1964 by another Berkeley Optometry faculty member, <a href="https://optometry.berkeley.edu/alumni/hall-of-fame/horace-b-barlow/">Horace Barlow</a>, and his colleagues (4). However, in the decades since, the lack of evidence for DSGCs in higher species led scientists to speculate that primate direction selectivity was computed in the brain. But when new evidence emerged suggesting that some human gaze stabilization disorders could be linked to abnormal activity of DSGCs (5), Puthussery’s lab renewed their efforts to find them. “That was a tipping point. We thought DSGCs had to be there, but that they made up a very low percentage of retinal ganglion cells. Our challenge was to work out how to find the needle in the haystack,” said Dr. Puthussery.</p>
<p>The researchers used a multi-pronged approach to overcome this problem. First, they leveraged data from state-of-the-art genetic tools (2) to track down retinal neurons with molecular features resembling DSGCs in other animals. The researchers then labeled these neurons with fluorescent markers to show that they had the expected anatomical features. Finally, the team built a customized imaging system to track the activity of hundreds of retinal ganglion cells and show that the fluorescently tagged cells responded selectively to images moving in specific directions. This combination of molecular, anatomical, and functional evidence provided unequivocal identification of the long sought-after DSGCs.</p>
<p>“The Puthussery Lab was successful where others failed because of their novel approach,” said Dr. Marla Feller. She continued, “I also cannot overstate the high quality of the data, which is critical for such a breakthrough finding.”</p>

<h2>New Insights into Common Visual Disorders</h2>

<p>These findings will enable researchers to better understand how retinal mechanisms contribute to gaze stabilization in the normal visual system and in disorders that cause unstable gaze. For example, nystagmus is a repetitive, uncontrolled movement of the eyes that can lead to unsteady and blurry vision. Nystagmus can occur in isolation or can accompany other eye problems such as albinism and certain inherited retinal diseases. While many forms of nystagmus are caused by problems in the brain or inner ear, the results of this study suggest that some forms of nystagmus could originate from abnormal activity of DSGCs in the retina (5).</p>

<h2>Looking Forward: Testing for Blinding Diseases</h2>
<p>Overall, these results provide a vivid demonstration that a rare retinal ganglion cell type may nonetheless have a profound impact on our overall visual experience. The approach used in this study can now be applied to determine the roles of other human ganglion cell types whose functions are unknown. This will be an important step toward designing more sensitive tests for the detection of blinding diseases that cause ganglion cell degeneration such as glaucoma, which afflicts 80 million people worldwide and is the leading cause of irreversible blindness (7,8). For example, if direction-selective ganglion cells are damaged early in glaucoma, changes in eye movements might serve as an objective biomarker for early damage.</p>
<p>Remarkably, half of all individuals with glaucoma are unaware that they have it (7,8). Ultimately, detecting early changes in ganglion cell activity is vital to diagnosing disease and preventing vision loss in our aging population.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>This is a fun one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ve spent more time than I’d care to admit staring at LLM output. And there’s something that I’ve noticed: LLM-generated prose has a kind of… vibe. It’s difficult to describe, but in this initial era of LLMs, it tends to be fairly obvious when you’re reading an AI-generated piece of prose.</p>
<p>One giveaway I've noticed is this particular turn of phrase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Culture is a <u>complex and multifaceted</u> ...” <br>
“Intelligence is <u>complex and multifaceted</u> ...” <br>
“Technology is a <u>complex and multifaceted</u> ...”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/meme">true Dawkinsian sense</a>, the phrase <em>'complex and multifaceted'</em> has become a <strong>meme</strong>. I've seen it again and again in outputs from GPT, but to double-check, I did a bunch of GPT-3.5 generations (<a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/padolsey/89469513af62b70301a2540bbf5fef7b/raw/9f479453116fcd0336377050eaa9c5b6e040602e/gen_gpt_complex_and_test.py">code here</a>). Here's what I found when generating completions for a prompt of <code>'complex and ...'</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.j11y.io/post_imgs/multifaceted/gpt_gens.png" alt="x"></p>
<p>There is a bizarre prevalence of the term <em>'multifaceted'</em> specifically. Why?</p>
<p>I wanted to understand whether this phrase and the specific word <em>'multifaceted'</em> was newly popular or had existed for a while. As a first port of call, I had a look at Google Trends. And I observed a very shocking increase within the last year:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.j11y.io/post_imgs/multifaceted/goog.png" alt="google trends graph showing sharp climb in the last year for the word 'multifaceted'"></p>
<p>At this point I wanted to get an indication of whether this was an online-only trend. It's hard to establish this but I thought I'd try Google Books' N-gram viewer. Maybe it would show me. And, as suspected, we see <a href="https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=multifaceted&amp;year_start=2004&amp;year_end=2019&amp;corpus=en-2019&amp;smoothing=3">no notable inflection</a>, although one can see there's a gentle increase over time.</p>
<p><em>Tangent</em>: For what it's worth, I find it a bit of a weird phrase. It's a tautology, as <em>'complex'</em> and <em>'multifaceted'</em> are almost synonomous. It reminds me of legal doublets like <em>'null and void'</em> and <em>'cease and desist'</em>. It's a rather nice and affirmatory way of saying something. I guess it sounds clever and informed, which is, after all, the vibe LLMs are going for.</p>
<p>Anyway, I wanted to go a bit further in order to ensure this was actually a newly prevalent phrase online. Google Trends isn't very convincing by itself. So I went digging for other places where linguistic trends over time might be queryable. I discovered that <a href="https://web.archive.org/">web archive</a> helpfully retains various PDFs over the years, ranging from whitepapers to general reference material from accross the web. It allows you to search for specific keywords as well.</p>
<p>I carried out a bunch of searches from 2006 to 2022 As well as the word <em>'multifaceted'</em>. Oh and I was also interested in another viral word I'd spotted: <em>'intricate'</em>. To ensure some level of scientific prudence, I compared these words with other terms as experimental controls.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.j11y.io/post_imgs/multifaceted/webarchive_keyphrases.png" alt="words like 'multifaceted' and 'intricate' increased drastically inline with LLM popularity, unlike control terms like 'efficacious' and 'symbiotic' which have remained stable"></p>
<p>As we see, from 2021 onwards, just around the time when GPT and other LLMs started to take the world by storm, the prevalence of our word <em>'multifaceted'</em> increased significantly, from being in only 0.05% of PDFs to 0.23%.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now, to zoom out a bit. I discovered the entire phrase, <em>'a complex and multifaceted'</em>, exists in around <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22a+complex+and+multifaceted%22">800,000 places</a> online.</p>
<p>If narrowed down, we see it composed of some particular domains ahead of others:</p>
<pre><code>Quora.com:      48,000
LinkedIn.com:   30,700
Facebook.com:   9,500
Instagram.com:  7,330
Medium.com:     6,250
Reddit.com:     1,370
CourseHero.com: 7,340
jstor.org:      1,320
wikipedia.org:  400
twitter.com:    798
classace.io:    842 (*notably an essay bank*)
chegg.com:      930 (*notably an essay bank*)
</code></pre>
<p>Quora has 5.7% of all occurances online! If it isn't the birthplace of this meme, it is definitely its breeding ground.</p>
<p>N.B. FWIW we can see what proportion Quora <em>~should</em> be taking up, all things being equal. An arbitrary word like "systemic" appears <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22systemic%22">445 million</a> online, yet only <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22systemic%22+site%3Aquora.com">272,000</a> times on Quora. That's 0.06% of all occurrances. So Quora's 5.7% share of our meme-phrase is completely disproportionate. Are we even surprised? Quora does have a reputation for its spam-bots. They are, at this point, mere regurgitation machines:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.j11y.io/post_imgs/multifaceted/quora_shots.png" alt="Tonnes of the same sentence structure repeated like 'philosophy is a complex and multifaceted concept that encompasses.....'"></p>
<p>I also couldn't ignore the fact that Quora has lately been embedding a ChatGPT widget on almost every page, and this widget's content is pre-generated, static and available for crawling. It is thus liable to being used as additional training material for this and other LLMs.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.j11y.io/post_imgs/multifaceted/quora_chatgpt.png" alt="Screenshot of ChatGPT widget embedded in a quora page"></p>
<p>ChatGPT specifically seems to absolutely adore the phrase, using it at every opportunity to explain higher level concepts. The most prevalent pattern seems to be <em>'[noun] is a complex and multifaceted [concept|theory|process]'</em>. Some common ones and their relative quantities across Quora:</p>
<ul>
<li>"a complex and multifaceted concept" - <code>4590</code></li>
<li>"a complex and multifaceted issue" - <code>4420</code></li>
<li>"a complex and multifaceted process" - <code>3550</code></li>
<li>"a complex and multifaceted phenomenon" - <code>2230</code></li>
<li>"a complex and multifaceted emotion" - <code>1650</code></li>
<li>"a complex and multifaceted trait" - <code>1560</code></li>
</ul>
<p><em>(these values vary across locales)</em></p>
<p>If we pick one of these and do a general search across the web, once again we observe incredibly sharp increases across time. The phrase <em>'a complex and multifaceted phenomenon'</em> has 74,900 occurances across the web according to Google. However, only 73 prior to 2010. That's a 1000x increase in only 13 years.</p>
<p>You get the idea. ChatGPT has taken this meme and and rolled with it. This silly LLM has assumed the phrase a core part of our language when it was only ever a narrowly used and awkward turn of phrase.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>What's the conclusion to this absurd rabbit hole? Have we learned anything?</strong></p>
<p>We know that initial versions of GPT were trained quite significantly on Reddit, and it's probably also the case that a small selection of other websites have been used since then to build and bolster additional models. </p>
<p>Focusing the training on any particular website will lead to strong biases. For example, fixating too much on academic material or websites like Quora where bots formulaically re-use certain phrases (this occurred even in the era before LLMs).</p>
<p>Furthermore, since these models have taken off in popularity, and people have then been publishing their outputs back onto the internet. As this occurs, it's likely produced a feedback loop. LLMs are unknowingly training on their own regurgitated outputs. It's unavoidable.</p>
<p>So, by those very tiny initial training decisions, just a handful of engineers have begun a unstoppable chain of incestuous linguistic evolution. It is fascinating how powerful these models are becoming in shifting the nature of language itself.</p>

<p>A <b>galactic algorithm</b> is one with world-beating theoretical (asymptotic) performance, but which is never used in practice. Typical reasons are that the performance gains only appear for problems that are so large they never occur, or the algorithm's complexity outweighs a relatively small gain in performance.  Galactic algorithms were so named by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lipton" title="Richard Lipton">Richard Lipton</a> and Ken Regan,<sup id="cite_ref-seminal_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-seminal-1">[1]</a></sup> because they will never be used on any data sets on Earth.

<p>Even if they are never used in practice, galactic algorithms may still contribute to computer science:

<ul><li>An algorithm, even if impractical, may show new techniques that may eventually be used to create practical algorithms.</li>
<li>Available computational power may catch up to the crossover point, so that a previously impractical algorithm becomes practical.</li>
<li>An impractical algorithm can still demonstrate that conjectured bounds can be achieved, or that proposed bounds are wrong, and hence advance the theory of algorithms.

<p>For cryptographers, a cryptographic "break" is anything faster than a brute-force attack – i.e., performing one trial decryption for each possible key. In many cases, even though they are the best known methods,  they are still infeasible with current technology.

<p>A single algorithm, "Hutter search", can solve any well-defined problem in an asymptotically optimal time, barring some caveats. It works by searching through all possible algorithms (by runtime), while simultaneously searching through all possible proofs (by length of proof), looking for a proof of correctness for each algorithm.  Since the proof of correctness is of finite size, it "only" adds a constant and does not affect the asymptotic runtime. However, this constant is so big that the algorithm is entirely impractical.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>  For example, if the shortest proof of correctness of a given algorithm is 1000 bits long, the search will examine at least 2<sup>999</sup> other potential proofs first.
</p><p>Hutter search is related <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomonoff%27s_theory_of_inductive_inference" title="Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference">Solomonoff induction</a>, which is a formalization of Bayesian inference.  All <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computable" title="Computable">computable</a> theories (as implemented by programs) which perfectly describe previous observations are used to calculate the probability of the next observation, with more weight put on the shorter computable theories.  Again, the search over all possible explanations makes this procedure Galactic.
