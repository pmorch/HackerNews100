<h2>Key Facts</h2>
<div>
 <div>
  <p>The board affirmed the decision of administrative law Judge Lauren Esposito, who ruled last year that Apple illegally stopped workers from placing union flyers on a table in the break room of the World Trade Center store, confiscated the flyers and interrogated staff over their “protected concerted activity.”</p>
  
 </div>
 <div>
  <p>Esposito ordered Apple cease and desist from illegally questioning workers about union matters in addition to confiscating union flyers from the store’s employee break room.</p>
  
 </div>
 <div>
  <p>Monday’s ruling is the board’s first decision against Apple, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-06/apple-illegally-interrogated-nyc-retail-staff-us-labor-board-rules?srnd=homepage-americas" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-06/apple-illegally-interrogated-nyc-retail-staff-us-labor-board-rules?srnd=homepage-americas" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-06/apple-illegally-interrogated-nyc-retail-staff-us-labor-board-rules?srnd=homepage-americas" aria-label="Bloomberg">Bloomberg</a>, which first reported the ruling and cited agency spokesperson Kayla Blado.</p>
  
 </div>
 <p>The board cannot impose fines or direct punishments against Apple for its violations.</p>
 <p>Apple didn’t immediately respond to Forbes’ request for comment.</p>

<h2>Key Background</h2>
<p>Other cases against Apple are still pending, according to Bloomberg, which noted a case in which a National Labor Relations Board member accused the company of illegally excluding unionized workers from certain benefits. Several Apple stores have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/10/24126657/apple-store-employees-new-jersey-unionize" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/10/24126657/apple-store-employees-new-jersey-unionize" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/10/24126657/apple-store-employees-new-jersey-unionize" aria-label="moved to unionize">moved to unionize</a> in recent years including ones in Short Hills, New Jersey, Oklahoma City and Towson, Maryland, with the latter two locations successfully establishing a union. Apple employees outside of the World Trade Center store staffers have also run into opposition while seeking to unionize.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.beyondloom.com/decker/index.html">https://www.beyondloom.com/decker/index.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40292181">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><h2>Decker</h2>

<p>Decker is a multimedia platform for creating and sharing interactive documents, with sound, images, hypertext, and scripted behavior. You can try it in your web browser <b><a href="https://www.beyondloom.com/decker/tour.html">right now</a></b>.</p>

<center>
	<a href="https://www.beyondloom.com/decker/tour.html"><img src="https://www.beyondloom.com/decker/images/wings.gif"></a>
</center>

<p>Decker builds on the legacy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard">HyperCard</a> and the visual aesthetic of classic MacOS. It retains the simplicity and ease of learning that HyperCard provided, while adding many subtle and overt quality-of-life improvements, like deep undo history, support for scroll wheels and touchscreens, more modern keyboard navigation, and bulk editing operations.</p>

<p>Anyone can use Decker to create E-Zines, organize their notes, give presentations, build adventure games, or even just doodle some 1-bit pixel art. The holistic "ditherpunk" aesthetic is cozy, a bit nostalgic, and provides fun and distinctive creative constraints. As a prototyping tool, Decker encourages embracing a sketchy, imperfect approach. Finished decks can be saved as standalone <fixed>.html</fixed> documents which self-execute in a web browser and can be shared anywhere you can host or embed a web page. Decker also runs natively on MacOS, Windows, and Linux.</p>

<p>For more complex projects, Decker features a novel scripting language named <i>Lil</i> which is strongly influenced by both <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>, an imperative language popular for embedding in tools and game engines, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_%28programming_language_from_Kx_Systems%29">Q</a>, a functional language in the APL family used with time-series databases. Lil is easy to learn and conventional enough not to ruffle any feathers for users with prior programming experience, but also includes pleasant surprises like implicit scalar-vector arithmetic and an integrated SQL-like query language. A few lines of Lil can go a long way.</p>

<center>
	<img src="https://www.beyondloom.com/decker/images/calc.gif">
</center>

<p>Decker provides a small collection of built-in interactive widgets for building interfaces, as well as a facility for <a href="https://www.beyondloom.com/decker/decker.html#customwidgets">defining new ones</a>. Custom widgets and their definitions can be copied and pasted using the system clipboard, which also makes it possible to share them anywhere you can share or store text. Every deck is a toolkit of reusable parts that can be harvested and repurposed for another project.</p>

<center>
	<img src="https://www.beyondloom.com/decker/images/contrap.gif">
</center>

<p>Decker is command-line friendly: when built from source, it comes with <a href="https://www.beyondloom.com/decker/lilt.html">Lilt</a>, a standalone Lil interpreter which can (among other things) read, write, manipulate, and even execute Decker documents "headlessly". Lilt has even fewer dependencies than Decker itself, so it can also be compiled as a cross-platform <a href="https://justine.lol/ape.html">APE executable</a>, ready for writing run-anywhere shell scripts. Would you believe there's a Lil interpreter <a href="https://www.beyondloom.com/blog/lila.html">that runs on POSIX AWK</a>? Decks are stored in a line-oriented text format which interoperates well with existing source control tools like Git and SVN.</p>

<p>Decker includes no advertising, telemetry, gamification, or other intrusions on user privacy and autonomy. If you like Decker, please share it with other people who might enjoy it. Build something that makes you happy.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Introduction to Granite Code Models</h2><a id="user-content-introduction-to-granite-code-models" aria-label="Permalink: Introduction to Granite Code Models" href="#introduction-to-granite-code-models"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We introduce the Granite series of decoder-only code models for code generative tasks (e.g., fixing bugs, explaining code, documenting code), trained with code written in 116 programming languages. A comprehensive evaluation of the Granite Code model family on diverse tasks demonstrates that our models consistently reach state-of-the-art performance among available open-source code LLMs.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="auto">The key advantages of Granite Code models include:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>All-rounder Code LLM: Granite Code models achieve competitive or state-of-the-art performance on different kinds of code-related tasks, including code generation, explanation, fixing, editing, translation, and more. Demonstrating their ability to solve diverse coding tasks.</li>
<li>Trustworthy Enterprise-Grade LLM: All our models are trained on license-permissible data collected following <a href="https://www.ibm.com/impact/ai-ethics" rel="nofollow">IBM's AI Ethics principles</a> and guided by IBM’s Corporate Legal team for trustworthy enterprise usage. We release all our Granite Code models under an <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0" rel="nofollow">Apache 2.0 license</a> license for research and commercial use.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The family of <strong>Granite Code Models</strong> comes in two main variants:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Granite Code Base Models: base foundational models designed for code-related tasks (e.g., code repair, code explanation, code synthesis).</li>
<li>Granite Code Instruct Models: instruction following models finetuned using a combination of Git commits paired with human instructions and open-source synthetically generated code instruction datasets.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Both base and instruct models are available in sizes of 3B, 8B, 20B, and 34B parameters.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Data Collection</h2><a id="user-content-data-collection" aria-label="Permalink: Data Collection" href="#data-collection"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Our process to prepare code pretraining data involves several stages. First, we collect a combination of publicly available datasets (e.g., GitHub Code Clean, Starcoder data), public code repositories, and issues from GitHub. Second, we filter the code data collected based on the programming language in which data is written (which we determined based on file extension). Then, we also filter out data with low code quality. Third, we adopt an aggressive deduplication strategy that includes both exact and fuzzy deduplication to remove documents having (near) identical code content. Finally, we apply a HAP content filter that reduces models' likelihood of generating hateful, abusive, or profane language. We also make sure to redact Personally Identifiable Information (PII) by replacing PII content (e.g., names, email addresses, keys, passwords) with corresponding tokens (e.g., ⟨NAME⟩, ⟨EMAIL⟩, ⟨KEY⟩, ⟨PASSWORD⟩). We also scan all datasets using ClamAV to identify and remove instances of malware in the source code. In addition to collecting code data for model training, we curate several publicly available high-quality natural language datasets for improving the model’s proficiency in language understanding and mathematical reasoning.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Pretraining</h2><a id="user-content-pretraining" aria-label="Permalink: Pretraining" href="#pretraining"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The <strong>Granite Code Base</strong> models are trained on 3-4T tokens of code data and natural language datasets related to code. Data is tokenized via byte pair encoding (BPE), employing the same tokenizer as StarCoder. We utilize high-quality data with two phases of training as follows:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Phase 1 (code only training): During phase 1, 3B and 8B models are trained for 4 trillion tokens of code data comprising 116 languages. The 20B parameter model is trained on 3 trillion tokens of code. The 34B model is trained on 1.4T tokens after the depth upscaling which is done on the 1.6T checkpoint of 20B model.</li>
<li>Phase 2 (code + language training): In phase 2, we include additional high-quality publicly available data from various domains, including technical, mathematics, and web documents, to further improve the model’s performance. We train all our models for 500B tokens (80% code-20% language mixture) in phase 2 training.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Instruction Tuning</h2><a id="user-content-instruction-tuning" aria-label="Permalink: Instruction Tuning" href="#instruction-tuning"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Granite Code Instruct models are finetuned on the following types of instruction data: 1) code commits sourced from <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/commitpackft" rel="nofollow">CommitPackFT</a>, 2) high-quality math datasets, specifically we used <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/MathInstruct" rel="nofollow">MathInstruct</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/meta-math/MetaMathQA" rel="nofollow">MetaMathQA</a>, 3) Code instruction datasets such as <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/glaiveai/glaive-code-assistant-v3" rel="nofollow">Glaive-Code-Assistant-v3</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/self-oss-instruct-sc2-exec-filter-50k" rel="nofollow">Self-OSS-Instruct-SC2</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/glaiveai/glaive-function-calling-v2" rel="nofollow">Glaive-Function-Calling-v2</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/bugdaryan/sql-create-context-instruction" rel="nofollow">NL2SQL11</a> and a small collection of synthetic API calling datasets, and 4) high-quality language instruction datasets such as <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/HelpSteer" rel="nofollow">HelpSteer</a> and an open license-filtered version of <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/garage-bAInd/Open-Platypus" rel="nofollow">Platypus</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Evaluation Results</h2><a id="user-content-evaluation-results" aria-label="Permalink: Evaluation Results" href="#evaluation-results"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We conduct an extensive evaluation of our code models on a comprehensive list of benchmarks that includes but is not limited to HumanEvalPack, MBPP, and MBPP+. This set of benchmarks encompasses different coding tasks across commonly used programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, C++, Rust).</p>
<p dir="auto">Our findings reveal that Granite Code models outperform strong open-source models across model sizes. The figure below illustrates how <code>Granite-8B-Code-Base</code> outperforms <code>Mistral-7B</code>, <code>LLama-3-8B</code>, and other open-source models in three coding tasks. We provide further evaluation results in our paper.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<p>A vision during an LSD trip is what inspired Owsley “Bear” Stanley, the Grateful Dead’s sound engineer’s mammoth feat of technical engineering, “The Wall of Sound”, irreversibly changing live sound and engineering for the better.</p>
<p>It was a time when live sound problems plagued engineers, bands, and audiences equally. While rock concerts grew in size and scope throughout the 60s, audiences grew larger and louder, without the technical sophistication of amplification ever changing to meet this scenario. Screaming fans meant that low-wattage guitar amps could hardly be heard and without the help of monitoring systems, bands could barely hear themselves play. Things were so bad that the Beatles quit touring in 1966 because they couldn’t hear themselves over the audience. It was after this era that the band, the Grateful Dead, became obsessed with their sound, largely thanks to their eccentric and dedicated sound engineer. Though incredibly frustrated with the noisy, feedback-laden, underpowered situation, they did not want to give up playing live, and the Dead had Owsley on board to help solve the sound situation.</p>
<h4>Who was Bear Owsley?</h4>
<div id="attachment_2627"><p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2627" src="https://audioacademy.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/owsley1-300x300.jpg" alt="Bear Owsley Stanley" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://audioacademy.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/owsley1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://audioacademy.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/owsley1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://audioacademy.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/owsley1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://audioacademy.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/owsley1-350x350.jpg 350w, https://audioacademy.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/owsley1.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-2627">Owsley Stanley, left, with Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead</p></div>
<p>The famous story goes that in 1974 the Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart walked on stage to find Owsley “Bear Stanley standing in front of a wall of over 600 speakers with tears streaming down his face. Whispering to the huge mass of equipment, Bear said, “I love you and you love me- how could you fail me?” This story sums up Owsley’s obsession with sound, both as a concept and as a physical thing. A former ballet dancer and craftsman from Kentucky, Owsley was also jailed twice for manufacturing and distributing LSD, the profits of which he used to finance the Grateful Dead for some time. The band which formed in the San Fransico bay area during the hippie days of the mid-1960s boasted of a huge cult following. An engineering dropout, he met the Grateful Dead through Ken Kesey, during one of his infamous ‘acid test’ parties in 1965 and became friends with them.</p>
<p>Owsley, or ‘Bear’, as he became known, began to work with the band as their sound man and financed them with his earnings cooking acid. He was also the person who along with his good friend Bob Thomas, helped design the iconic lightning bolt logo, which would sell countless t-shirts. After a hallucinatory incident, where Owsley ‘saw’ the Grateful Dead’s sound, he became obsessed with aural perfection and started on an endless path, working with the band, to achieve it.</p>
<p>Keeping a sonic journal of each performance of the band, he would use it to improve on his setup and mix for each concert and highlight issues to the band members. He insisted on sound checks and encouraged them to listen to tapes of their performances, so that they could hear how they sounded, and also correct him on what he was doing. Rumored to have taken inspiration Buffalo Springfield’s monitoring setup, Owsley was not satisfied with the standard speakers and amplifiers that were available to him and began modifying and manufacturing his own audio gear with his apprentice Tim Scully, eventually founding the company Alembic.</p>
<p>In a 1969 meeting when brainstorming ideas for musical exploration and solutions for their technical problems and smoking ‘special’ cigarettes, Owsley proposed putting the P.A behind the band. This casual, stoned suggestion would change the way audio engineers thought about concert sound. This meant that the audience and the band would hear the same thing without any delays, chaotic reverb, colliding frequencies, and minimal-to-no feedback. Soon after this, Bear began his most ambitious design to date. He, Dan Healy and Mark Raizene of the Grateful Dead’s sound team collaborated with Ron Wickersham, Rick Turner and John Curl of Alembic to create the legendary Wall of sound.</p>
<h4>The Wall of Sound</h4>
<div id="attachment_2628"><p><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2628" src="https://audioacademy.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/grateful_dead_wall_of_sound_01-300x200.jpg" alt="wall of sound" width="476" height="317" srcset="https://audioacademy.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/grateful_dead_wall_of_sound_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://audioacademy.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/grateful_dead_wall_of_sound_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://audioacademy.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/grateful_dead_wall_of_sound_01.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 476px) 100vw, 476px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-2628">The Wall of Sound, 1973</p></div>
<p>The mammoth structure was massive, made up of over 600 hi-fidelity speakers that sat behind the band as they played. It used six separate sound systems which were able to isolate eleven separate channels with vocals, rhythm guitar, piano each having their own channel. Another channel each for the bass drum, snare, tom-toms, and cymbals. The bass was transmitted through a quadraphonic encoder, which took a signal from each string and projected it through its own set of speakers. The result of each speaker carrying only one instrument or voice at a time was crystal clear audio, free of intermodulation distortion.</p>
<p>The Wall of Sound served as its own monitoring system and solved many, if not all of the technical problems that sound engineers faced at that time. This design was also the first of its kind to eliminate the need for a sound guy, at least at the front of house. In addition to monitor controls, each of the microphones had volume dials. The idea was that each band member could adjust the sound in real time. The situation of the monitors gave the band the power to control their own sound. While the system had many trials and errors, the largest version stood three stories high and about 30 meters wide, the first line array system of this scale ever assembled. High-quality audio could be heard at 200 meters, with decent sound up to another 200 meters, at which point wind started to degrade the audio. The completed Wall of Sound made its debut in 1974.</p>
<p>Some of the early issues that surfaced was problems with feedback between the speakers and the singers’ rear-facing vocal microphones and the giant task of physically mounting the system. It was a logistical nightmare and almost made the band go bankrupt, because almost as soon as it rose the roof, it was time to pull it back down again. Eventually, the massive Wall of Sound had to be streamlined into a far more manageable and cost-effective touring rig. All the same, Owsley and the band’s willingness take ideas and execution to extreme lengths changed live sound forever.</p>
<h4>The Legacy of the Wall of Sound</h4>
<p>While parts of the wall were kept, repurposed and recycled for future touring rigs, other parts were sold off. Legend has it that friends of the Grateful Dead, Hot Tuna and Jefferson Starship quickly bought some of the highly sought-after top-of-the-range gear. While modern improvements in these technologies have the benefit of being far more powerful and lightweight than the Wall’s, in terms of experimental, unrestrained engineering, at a time where there was nothing like it ever heard, the Wall of Sound remains unparalleled.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As our friend of the blog, Wes Bos, pointed out the other day, React 19 (beta) added, all the way at the bottom of the announcement, much-awaited <a href="https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19#support-for-custom-elements">support for web components</a>.</p><div data-theme="light"><article><p><span>Tucked all the way at the bottom on the React 19 release notes is full support for web components!  🥳 </span></p></article></div><p>I say “much-awaited”, but the truth is a lot of people are not going to care at all about that. There are some, though, like us who really care and have been paying close attention.</p><p>At Mux we have not been shy about our fondness for web components over the last few years. It started with building Mux Player on our <a href="https://www.mux.com/blog/media-chrome-turns-1-0">web components-based player framework Media Chrome</a> (thanks for the <a href="https://twitter.com/jhooks/status/1785410152025543065">kind words about Media Chrome</a>, Joel).</p><p>But I want to drive home one point about our fondness for web components. It’s not about some righteous party line, which so many front-end tooling debates devolve into. If you came to this post for some juicy nerd drama, turn around because that’s not what we’re here for. <a href="https://www.mux.com/blog/slow-is-stable-stable-is-fast-building-mux-player-on-the-slow-platform-of-web-components">Our adoption of web components is purely based on practicality</a>. Nothing more, and nothing less. Is it the best tool for every job? Obviously not. But we believe it is the best tool for the job of building a framework-agnostic video player SDK. We still use React heavily. In fact, we were early adopters of <a href="https://www.mux.com/blog/what-are-react-server-components">React Server Components and wrote about it</a> in Darius’s widely circulated post.</p><h2 id="so-what-does-this-mean-for-react-actually"><a href="#so-what-does-this-mean-for-react-actually"><span><span><svg role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="42" height="42" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 42 42"><title>Link</title><path d="m18.172 15.343 3.535-3.535a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 0l1.414 1.414a5 5 0 0 1 0 7.07l-3.535 3.536M23.828 26.657l-3.535 3.535a5 5 0 0 1-7.071 0l-1.414-1.414a5 5 0 0 1 0-7.07l3.535-3.536" vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"></path><path stroke-linecap="round" d="m25.243 16.757-8.486 8.486" vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"></path></svg></span></span>So what does this mean for React, actually?</a></h2><p>To contrast all the positives about building SDKs on web components, React support has been by far the biggest hurdle to clear for web components projects. Raw web components have always <strong>worked</strong> in React (it’s just HTML, after all), but the challenge was more about the ergonomics of using web components in a React world.</p><p>For example, React developers don't interact directly with HTML elements to do things like add event listeners and call functions. It sort of goes against the declarative nature of React itself.</p><p>So although setting up an event listener was possible, like this, it feels very un-React-y:</p><div><figure><figcaption><p>jsx</p></figcaption><pre><code><span></span><span>function</span> <span>MyComponent</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
<span></span>  <span>const</span> ref <span>=</span> <span>useRef</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span></span>  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>count<span>,</span> setCount<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span></span>
<span></span>  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
<span></span>    <span>function</span> <span>handleClick</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
<span></span>      <span>setCount</span><span>(</span>count <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
<span></span>    <span>}</span>
<span></span>    <span>if</span> <span>(</span>ref<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
<span></span>       ref<span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'click'</span><span>,</span> handleClick<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span></span>    <span>}</span>
<span></span>    <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
<span></span>      ref<span>.</span><span>removeEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>'click'</span><span>,</span> handleClick<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span></span>    <span>}</span>
<span></span>  <span>}</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span>ref<span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span></span>
<span></span>  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>my-button</span> <span>ref</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>ref<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>Hello! </span><span>{</span>count<span>}</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>my-button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span></span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure></div><p>Because of this, most maintainers (us included), have chosen to create React-specific wrappers. That works well, but it always felt like a stop-gap. Now that React 19 supports web components directly, you can do things like pass event listeners as React props and React props passed to the element get automatically set as properties on the element. There’s some extra complexity here for web component authors to handle attributes vs. properties. Not all web components will play nice with React from day 1, but at least we have a path forward.</p><p>See here, this feels much more React-y:</p><div><figure><figcaption><p>jsx</p></figcaption><pre><code><span></span><span>function</span> <span>MyComponent</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
<span></span>  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>count<span>,</span> setCount<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span></span>
<span></span>  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
<span></span>    <span>&lt;</span>my<span>-</span>button
<span></span>      ref<span>=</span><span>{</span>ref<span>}</span>
<span></span>      onClick<span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setCount</span><span>(</span>count <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>}</span>
<span></span>     <span>&gt;</span>
<span></span>       Hello<span>!</span> <span>{</span>count<span>}</span>
<span></span>     <span><span><span>&lt;/</span>my-button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span></span>  <span>)</span>
<span></span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure></div><p>Internally, all React is doing here is taking the onClick prop and setting up/tearing down the click handler under the hood. Which is basically what React wrappers were doing anyway.</p><p>I’m hoping that in 1 or 2 short years from now your average React developer will not be weirded out or averse to using a web component in their React application. And once that feels normal perhaps we can thank those old React wrappers for bringing us joy and then do away with them.</p><h2 id="it-still-might-be-a-little-weird"><a href="#it-still-might-be-a-little-weird"><span><span><svg role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="42" height="42" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 42 42"><title>Link</title><path d="m18.172 15.343 3.535-3.535a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 0l1.414 1.414a5 5 0 0 1 0 7.07l-3.535 3.536M23.828 26.657l-3.535 3.535a5 5 0 0 1-7.071 0l-1.414-1.414a5 5 0 0 1 0-7.07l3.535-3.536" vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"></path><path stroke-linecap="round" d="m25.243 16.757-8.486 8.486" vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"></path></svg></span></span>It still might be a little weird</a></h2><p>Event handlers and passing React props into web components is a nice improvement, but I think there’s still one weird thing about web components that doesn’t quite jive with the React way of doing things, and that’s the globally scoped element register.</p><p>In any React app, when you use a component, you have to import that component:</p><div><figure><figcaption><p>jsx</p></figcaption><pre><code><span></span><span>// when MyThing is a react component</span>
<span></span><span>import</span> MyThing <span>from</span> <span>'./components/my-thing'</span></code></pre></figure></div><p>But that doesn’t exist in the web components world (at least not yet). When you use &lt;my-button&gt; in a React component, you don’t have to explicitly import my-button from anywhere inside that file.</p><div><figure><figcaption><p>jsx</p></figcaption><pre><code><span></span><span>// when my-thing defines a web component is imported it gets registered globally</span>
<span></span><span>import</span> <span>'./components/my-thing'</span></code></pre></figure></div><p>Web components get imported and registered at the global level. This also means if two different libraries have a component called my-button, you can’t use both of them. This will certainly be a little weird for React developers to get used to. It also might change with <a href="https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/blob/gh-pages/proposals/Scoped-Custom-Element-Registries.md">Scope Custom Element Registries in the future</a>.</p><h2 id="dont-sleep-on-web-awesome-either"><a href="#dont-sleep-on-web-awesome-either"><span><span><svg role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="42" height="42" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 42 42"><title>Link</title><path d="m18.172 15.343 3.535-3.535a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 0l1.414 1.414a5 5 0 0 1 0 7.07l-3.535 3.536M23.828 26.657l-3.535 3.535a5 5 0 0 1-7.071 0l-1.414-1.414a5 5 0 0 1 0-7.07l3.535-3.536" vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"></path><path stroke-linecap="round" d="m25.243 16.757-8.486 8.486" vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"></path></svg></span></span>Don’t sleep on Web Awesome, either</a></h2><p>One other web components topic caught my eye last week. <a href="https://shoelace.style/">Shoelace</a>, one of the premier web components projects, launched a Kickstarter project for <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fontawesome/web-awesome">Web Awesome</a> after being acquired by Font Awesome. With a modest goal of $30,000, the campaign gained the pledges of <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fontawesome/web-awesome">6,725 backers for a total of $723,004</a>, nearly 25x the original goal. And I don’t think that’s all hype – I think there’s a reliable signal here that developers want a stable set of tools, built on browser standards.</p><h2 id="lets-see-how-things-pan-out"><a href="#lets-see-how-things-pan-out"><span><span><svg role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="42" height="42" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 42 42"><title>Link</title><path d="m18.172 15.343 3.535-3.535a5 5 0 0 1 7.071 0l1.414 1.414a5 5 0 0 1 0 7.07l-3.535 3.536M23.828 26.657l-3.535 3.535a5 5 0 0 1-7.071 0l-1.414-1.414a5 5 0 0 1 0-7.07l3.535-3.536" vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"></path><path stroke-linecap="round" d="m25.243 16.757-8.486 8.486" vector-effect="non-scaling-stroke"></path></svg></span></span>Let’s see how things pan out</a></h2><p>That’s all for now, we’ll see how things pan out. I, for one, am happy to see the React ecosystem moving in this direction. And I believe the general frontend ecosystem is criminally under-indexed on web components. All web application developers can benefit by moving parts of their applications away from framework-specific patterns and more towards browser-level standards. Frameworks will come and go, so as developers and maintainers we build against them at our own risk. Browser standards tend to come, albeit slowly, and then rarely disappear after that.</p><p>Right now the plan is to wait and see. In the short term, we’ll keep maintaining our React wrappers. It’s all going to depend on if React developers, as a general population, start embracing web components and start feeling comfortable using them in their applications. We want our component libraries to feel great and idiomatic wherever they’re used…and we hope one day soon that could just mean web components.</p></div><div><h2>Leave your wallet <br>where it is</h2><p>No credit card required to get started.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><header></header><p>Take a look at this:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://zed.dev/img/post/zed-decoded-linux-when/linux_screenshot_1.png" alt="Screenshot of Zed — but where are the red/yellow/green window controls?"><figcaption>Screenshot of Zed — but where are the red/yellow/green window controls?</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Does anything stick out? Yes, exactly, it's a screenshot of Zed running <em>on Linux</em>!</p>
<p>Wait, what? Zed on Linux? Is it released yet? No, it's not, but it's taking shape, fast.</p>
<p>At the end of January <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/zed-is-now-open-source">we open-sourced Zed</a> and had zero Linux support. Now, three months later, you can <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/main/docs/src/development/linux.md">compile &amp; run</a> Zed on Linux and actually use it. And I mean <em>really</em> use it — I've worked in Zed (on Zed!) the whole last week without any problems.</p>
<p>The words "alpha release" seem to appear at the end of the tunnel. We're getting closer.</p>
<p>Today we're going to talk about how Zed on Linux took shape, what the challenges were, who did the work, and what's still left to do.</p>
<!-- -->
<div><div><p><b>Companion Video</b>: <!-- -->Linux when?</p><p>This post comes with a 1hr companion video, in which Thorsten and Mikayla explore Zed on Linux, dig through the codebase to see how it's implemented, talk about implementation challenges, and how the open-source community helped out big time.</p><p>Watch the video here:<!-- --> <a href="https://youtu.be/O5XVVnA2LoY">https://youtu.be/O5XVVnA2LoY</a></p></div><p><img src="https://zed.dev/img/post/zed-decoded-linux-when/thumbnail.jpg" width="230" height="150"></p></div>
<h2 id="why-not-linux-from-the-start-or-the-tricky-thing-about-platforms"><span data-br=":R97brrrqbf9la:" data-brr="1">Why not Linux from the start? Or: the Tricky Thing About Platforms</span></h2>
<p>Why didn't Zed work on Linux out of the box? That's not an unreasonable thing to ask and many of you did. After all, Zed's written in Rust, a language that's known for its cross-platform support. So if Rust programs can run on macOS, Linux, and Windows, why didn't Zed?</p>
<p>The tricky thing about cross-platform support is that — in general and in Rust — it only works as long as you're fine with the platform being abstracted away, hidden behind an API that is the same on every platform.</p>
<p>At Zed, though, we want to use each platform as best as we can to build a high-performance application that is and <em>feels</em> native to the platform. That often means talking directly to the platform, in order to use it to the best of its abilities.</p>
<p>On macOS, for example, Zed makes direct use of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/metal/">Metal</a>. We have our <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/main/crates/gpui/src/platform/mac/shaders.metal">own shaders</a>, our <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/593f0e0c3ef08da7e528230867526dcb77e723fa/crates/gpui/src/platform/mac/metal_renderer.rs">own renderer</a>, and we put <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/120fps">a lot of effort into understanding macOS APIs to get to 120FPS</a>. Zed on macOS <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/98ea5e172ec114004116f996f51b46cdf5c438e4/crates/gpui/src/platform/mac/platform.rs#L66">is also a fully-native AppKit NSApplication</a> and we integrated <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/zed-decoded-async-rust">our async Rust runtime with macOS' native application runtime</a>.</p>
<p>If you want your application to have this level of depth and control over its platform integration <em>and</em> have it be cross-platform, what you'll need to build is a framework. A framework that allows you to talk directly to the platform whenever you need, but otherwise abstract it away from you so you don't have to worry about it when you write application-level code.</p>
<p>That's what Zed did. The framework is called <a href="https://www.gpui.rs/">GPUI</a> and when we released it as open-source, along with Zed, it came with cross-platform support. Except not really.</p>

<p>This <code>Platform</code> offers nearly everything an application might want to do: execute work on different threads, start/stop the application, manage windows, open URLs, open system dialogues to open files and directories, cursor style, clipboard, credentials, ... and a few more things that I left out to keep this succinct.</p>
<p>From the start, GPUI has had this <code>Platform</code> abstraction built-in. GPUI never was macOS-only. It was always platform-agnostic, as long as the <code>Platform</code> trait is implemented for the platform.</p>
<p>And that's essentially what it meant to get Zed running on Linux: implement <code>Platform</code> for Linux.</p>
<p>So, just implemented a bunch of methods and then Zed works on any platform? Well... yes, kind of.</p>
<p>Here's what the Linux <code>Platform</code> implementation <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/266988adea954cd759525cc7222e261536c25fd1/crates/gpui/src/platform/linux/platform.rs#L99-L281">looked like in the middle of February</a>. Again, in excerpts:</p>

<p>Some methods implemented, some marked with <code>todo!</code>, others panicking with an <code>unimplemented!()</code>. Back in February this file had 11 <code>todo!</code> comments and 9 calls to <code>unimplemented</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/593f0e0c3ef08da7e528230867526dcb77e723fa/crates/gpui/src/platform/linux/platform.rs#L99-L281">Now</a> it has 9 <code>todo!</code>s (different ones) and the word <code>unimplemented</code> in a string.</p>
<p>So, yes, the work was getting rid of the <code>todo!</code>s and implementing the missing methods. But we all know: not all methods are created equal.</p>
<p>While a <code>write_to_clipboard</code> method seems relatively straightforward to implement, things weren't as easy as the lower-case <code>todo!</code> and its defiantly cute exclamation mark might suggest.</p>
<h2 id="which-linux-are-you-talking-about"><span data-br=":Rt7brrrqbf9la:" data-brr="1">Which Linux are you talking about?</span></h2>
<p>A big challenge when building a GUI application for Linux is that there is no such thing as Linux, really. Linux is a kernel and when you install and run it, you're mostly likely doing that through a Linux distribution that gives you the rest of the operating system too: Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Arch, Gentoo, and so on.</p>
<p>They nearly all differ in some aspects that are relevant for an application developer. Example: package management. Distributions not only have their own format with which to distribute applications, but they also have different ways of managing dependencies. And there's no standard across distributions (but of course there are <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">competing standards</a>). So far, with Zed, we've avoided the whole packaging topic and just focused on building <code>.tar.gz</code> archives that others can then turn into distribution-specific packages. But just scrolling through <a href="https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable">Tailscale's Packages site</a> tells us that there's a lot of work to do that we never had to do for macOS.</p>
<p>But even if you focus on only one distribution, say Ubuntu, you still have to decide: do you support X11 or Wayland? Both are — ignoring some technical details (don't send me angry letters) — display servers with which Linux software can draw things on the screen. X11 has been around for a long, long time and Wayland has been trying to replace it, also for a long, long time. That, in turn, makes the question a trick question: you have to support both. They're both widely used. <em>Still used</em> in the case of X11 and <em>gaining users</em> in the case of Wayland, but it's not realistic that 100% of Linux users will be on Wayland anytime soon.</p>
<p>After deciding to support Ubuntu and X11 and Wayland, the next question is: which desktop environment or window manager are you going to support? KDE or GNOME? Qt or GTK? What about tiling window managers and users that want to turn window decorations off? Which <em>audio server</em> are you going to support to get audio calls working? PipeWire? Or still PulseAudio? Do you even have to worry about that or is that choice dictated by the desktop environment you chose?</p>
<p>I could probably go on and find more "actually, there's more than one of X" to list, but you get the point: when building a graphical application to run on Linux, you have to make quite a few technical decisions about which platform combinations to target and how.</p>
<p>And we haven't even touched on the most fundamental of all of these decisions yet: how do we render Zed?</p>
<h2 id="from-metal-to-what"><span data-br=":R147brrrqbf9la:" data-brr="1">From Metal to... what?</span></h2>
<p>Even if you knew how to package your application, and how to target X11 and/or Wayland, and managed to open an application window in them — how do you draw your application in that window?</p>
<p>You might have missed it, but in the <code>Platform</code> trait above, there's a method to open a new window:</p>

<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>In order to implement that, you also have to implement the interface of the thing it returns: <code>PlatformWindow</code>. And that packs a punch.</p>
<p>As of right now, <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/98ea5e172ec114004116f996f51b46cdf5c438e4/crates/gpui/src/platform.rs#L189-L241"><code>PlatformWindow</code> requires 37 methods</a> to be implemented. The methods range from hooks (<code>on_close</code>, <code>on_fullscreen</code>) to attributes (<code>is_fullscreen</code>, <code>is_minimized</code>) to bread-and-butter (<code>content_size</code>, <code>mouse_position</code>, <code>toggle_fullscreen</code>) to tricky (<code>scale_factor</code>, <code>appearance</code>).</p>
<p>But there's one method on <code>PlatformWindow</code> that's the most fundamental of them all: <code>draw</code>. Another name for it could be <code>where_the_rubber_hits_the_road</code>. Here is its implementation for macOS:</p>

<p>It doesn't look imposing, but it is: <code>Scene</code> is the result of GPUI rendering a frame and this method, <code>draw</code>, is what makes it appear on the screen.</p>
<p>A <code>Scene</code> is the visible parts of the application —&nbsp;text, windows, borders, rectangles, underlines, and so on — turned into data, <em>primitives</em>.

<p>Shadows, quads, paths, underlines, sprites — that's what GPUI boils your application down to when a frame is rendered. And then, in <code>draw</code>, it hands that data over to the renderer.</p>
<p>And the renderer — that's your GPU.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above: on macOS we use the Metal APIs to talk to the GPU and when you follow the definitions there, you'll end up at <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/98ea5e172ec114004116f996f51b46cdf5c438e4/crates/gpui/src/platform/mac/metal_renderer.rs#L238">a <code>fn draw</code>, implemented on <code>MetalRenderer</code></a>, that contains nearly the complete saga as told in our <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/120fps">120FPS</a> blog post: setting up a rendering pipeline, triple-buffering, syncing up with the OS and the display, all of that.</p>
<p>So how do we implement <code>draw</code> on Linux, without Metal? How do we talk to the GPU on Linux?</p>
<h2 id="enter-stage-the-open-source-hackers"><span data-br=":R1j7brrrqbf9la:" data-brr="1">Enter stage: the open-source hackers</span></h2>
<p>Less than two weeks after Zed going open-source, flying through the cloud of pull requests and issues that's been stirred up by all the excitement comes <a href="https://github.com/kvark">@kvark</a> (Dzmitry Malyshau) with a by now <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/7343">legendary PR</a> that makes Zed render on Linux. In less than four thousand lines of code. Sure, it didn't render all of Zed yet, but: wow.</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://zed.dev/img/post/zed-decoded-linux-when/kvark_pull_request.png" alt="Screenshot of kvark's pull request that made Zed render on Linux"><figcaption>Screenshot of kvark's pull request that made Zed render on Linux</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The PR answers the question of how to talk to the GPU on Linux: with <a href="https://github.com/kvark/blade">blade</a>, kvark's "rendering solution for Rust", that offers a "lean low-level GPU abstraction focused at ergonomics and fun". Blade uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulkan">Vulkan</a> under the hood, a graphics API that's similar to Metal in the level of abstraction it offers, to talk to the GPU and render Zed.</p>
<p>After @kvark opened the PR, Mikayla, Antonio, and Nathan reached out to him to talk about the feasibility of using Blade in Zed and shared goals. It didn't take long to get to a shared understanding and, exactly two weeks after open-sourcing Zed, the PR that made it compile and run on Linux was merged.</p>
<p>With that big TODO and question out of the way, the community jumped on the chance to remove the remaining <code>todo!</code>s: <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Awitelokk">@witelokk added support for Wayland</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+linux+author%3Akvark">@kvark continued his work on getting all of Zed to render smoothly</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/7852">@romgrk added support for file dialogues</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/9103">@apricobucket28 fixed scrolling and selections</a> and many others <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+in%3Atitle+linux">contributed and fixed a lot of other things</a>, with Mikayla diligently reviewing, coding, managing, leading and keeping an eye on everything.</p>
<p>This list of contributions is incomplete and I'm sure I should've mentioned more people, but the point I want to make is this: Zed on Linux was and is an impressive open-source team effort that surprised all of us at Zed with how fast it got Zed to a working state.</p>

<p>And there are two implementations of <code>LinuxClient</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/98ea5e172ec114004116f996f51b46cdf5c438e4/crates/gpui/src/platform/linux/wayland/client.rs#L360">one for Wayland</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Both of them have an implementation of <code>PlatformWindow</code> too:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/98ea5e172ec114004116f996f51b46cdf5c438e4/crates/gpui/src/platform/linux/wayland/window.rs#L533">here's the Wayland <code>PlatformWindow</code></a></li>

</ul>
<p>But both of them use Blade in their <code>draw</code> method:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre tabindex="0" data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><code data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><span data-line=""><span>// crates/gpui/src/platform/linux/x11/window.rs</span></span>

<span data-line=""><span>    renderer</span><span>: </span><span>BladeRenderer</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>impl</span><span> PlatformWindow</span><span> for</span><span> X11Window</span><span> {</span></span>

<span data-line=""><span>        inner</span><span>.renderer.</span><span>draw</span><span>(</span><span>scene</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    }</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>// crates/gpui/src/platform/linux/wayland/window.rs</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>struct</span><span> WaylandWindowState</span><span> {</span></span>

<span data-line=""><span>    renderer</span><span>: </span><span>BladeRenderer</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>impl</span><span> PlatformWindow</span><span> for</span><span> WaylandWindow</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    fn</span><span> draw</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>scene</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>Scene</span><span>) {</span></span>

<span data-line=""><span>    }</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>That means the rubber hits the road through these layers of abstractions:</p>
<ul>
<li>GPUI asks the <code>Platform</code> to open a window</li>
<li>The Wayland <code>LinuxClient</code> uses Wayland to open a window, the X11 client uses X11</li>
<li>When rendering a frame, GPUI turns the application into a <code>Scene</code></li>
<li>It then calls the <code>PlatformWindow</code> to <code>draw</code> that <code>Scene</code></li>
<li>Both the Wayland and the X11 implementations use Blade, which uses Vulkan, to talk to the GPU, to draw the <code>Scene</code></li>
</ul>
<p>That's obviously only scratching the surface. There are a lot more interesting things going in the Linux implementation — did you know that there's multiple clipboards on Linux but only one on macOS? Or here, take a look at this:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://zed.dev/img/post/zed-decoded-linux-when/linux_screenshot_2.png" alt="Screenshot of Zed on Linux, including a native file dialog"><figcaption>Screenshot of Zed on Linux, including a native file dialog</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Yup, that's a native file dialog, but we don't use GTK in Zed and that clearly is GTK — so, how does that work? You'll find the answer in <a href="https://youtu.be/O5XVVnA2LoY">the companion video</a> in which Mikayla and I dive deeper into this and also touch on the question of whether or not we should use GTK or Qt or something else (spoiler: it's complicated).</p>
<h2 id="so-linux-when"><span data-br=":R2b7brrrqbf9la:" data-brr="1">So, Linux when?</span></h2>
<p>So what's left to do for Linux? In order to get to an alpha release: <em>not that much</em>, but don't quote me on that. Essentially: fix 86 remaining <code>todo!</code>s of various difficulty levels, get window resizing/moving to work on Wayland, and implement system dialogues for GPUI. We're close, very close.</p>
<p>After the alpha, we'll need to add support for audio calls, drag &amp; drop, storing of credentials, make sure the performance is consistently high, increase stability, and so on. Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/issues/7015">Linux Roadmap</a> tracking issue.</p>
<p>Even though there might still be a lot to do (I don't even want to know how complicated drag &amp; drop can be on Linux— I mean, GNOM— I mean, KDE, no, I mea—) and a lot of unknown unknowns and surprises along the way, one thing's for sure: the fact that we got to the current state of Zed on Linux in three months, with that many high-quality open-source contributions, is pretty amazing.</p>
<p>Want to try out Zed on Linux? You need Rust, some dependencies, and depending on your patience enough CPU and memory to compile it in a reasonable amount of time. Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/main/docs/src/development/linux.md">these instructions</a>. Have fun!</p><hr></article></div></div>]]></description>

Those batteries are “able to very effectively manage that evening ramp where solar is going down and customer demand is increasing,” said John Phipps, executive director of grid operations for the California Independent System Operator, which oversees the state’s grid.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Batteries can also help California’s grid handle stresses from heat waves and wildfires, Mr. Phipps said. “It made some differences last summer,” he said. “We were able to meet high load days and wildfire days when we might lose some power lines.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In Texas, batteries are still largely used to provide ancillary services, stabilizing the grid against unexpected disruptions. Texas is also more reliant than California on wind energy, which fluctuates in less-predictable patterns.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->But Texas is quickly catching up to California in solar power, and batteries increasingly help with evening peaks. On April 28, the sun was setting just as wind power was unexpectedly low and many coal and gas plants were offline for repairs. Batteries jumped in, <a href="https://www.gridstatus.io/live/ercot?date=2024-04-28">supplying 4 percent of Texas’s electricity at one point</a>, enough to power a million homes. Last summer, batteries <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/ercot-grid-battery-solar-enel-texas-18350609.php">helped avert evening blackouts</a> by providing additional power during record heat.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><figure role="group" aria-label="graphic">   <div> <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Sources: Electric Reliability Council of Texas via <a href="http://gridstatus.io/">Grid Status</a><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->By The New York Times<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </div> </figure><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The two states built their battery fleets in distinct ways. In California, government mandates were the impetus: In 2019, regulators worried that too many older gas plants were closing, risking blackouts, and ordered utilities to quickly install thousands of megawatts of storage.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In Texas, market forces dominate. The state’s deregulated electricity system allows prices to fluctuate sharply, rising as high as $5,000 per megawatt-hour during acute shortages. That makes it lucrative for battery developers to take advantage of spikes, such as in locations where power lines periodically get clogged.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“Anywhere we think the market is going to get tight, you can put batteries in and even things out,” said Stephanie Smith, chief operating officer of Eolian, a battery developer. “Then, we’re making bets all day about when to charge and discharge.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->One battery, for instance, sits near Fort Worth, absorbing excess wind power from West Texas during the nighttime, when no one needs it, and feeding it into the grid when demand surges.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Other states are following. In Arizona and Georgia, utilities plan to install thousands of megawatts of battery capacity to help manage rising demand from data centers and factories. It helps that batteries can be deployed quickly, said Aaron Mitchell, vice president of planning and pricing at Georgia Power.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The industry still faces obstacles, however. Lithium-ion batteries are flammable, and while operators have taken steps to reduce fire risk, some communities <a href="https://thecoastnews.com/residents-remain-opposed-to-seguro-battery-facility-despite-changes/">oppose projects in their backyards</a>. Most batteries still come from China, making them vulnerable to trade disputes. In Texas, a state fund <a href="https://www.expressnews.com/business/article/texas-energy-fund-loan-program-ercot-19361692.php">to subsidize gas plants</a> could undercut the battery boom. In other states, complex regulations <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/10/02/battery-storage-seen-as-backbone-of-reliable-electric-grid-but-adoption-uneven-across-us/">sometimes prevent utilities from adding energy storage</a>.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“Because these storage resources are so new, the rules are still catching up,” said Natalie McIntire, who works on grid issues for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><h2><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Can Grid Batteries Help Fight Climate Change?<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></h2> </p><figure role="group" aria-label="image">   <div><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Wind turbines near Sweetwater, Texas.

That’s because operators focus on maximizing revenue and sometimes charge with coal or gas power.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“These batteries have an immense capability to abate carbon, but they need the right incentives to do so,” said Emma Konet, co-founder of <a href="https://www.tierraclimate.com/about">Tierra Climate</a>, a startup working to help batteries earn money for reducing emissions.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In California, by contrast, batteries appear to be cutting emissions from fossil fuels. The state’s gas use in April <a href="https://twitter.com/grid_status/status/1785399291671924856">fell to a seven-year low</a>. “We have reached the conclusion that batteries are displacing natural gas when solar generation is ramping up and down each day,” said Max Kanter, chief executive of Grid Status, an electricity data tracking firm.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Yet California still gets roughly 40 percent of its electricity from natural gas, and it could be difficult for current battery technology to replace all of that. One <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/how-pv-plus-storage-will-compete-with-gas-generation-in-the-u-s/">analysis from BloombergNEF</a> found that solar and batteries can be a cost-effective alternative to smaller gas “peaker” plants that only switch on when demand spikes. But batteries remain too costly to replace many of the larger gas-burning plants that provide steadier power day and night.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“You don’t want to necessarily build a system where you’ve got batteries to suck up every last megawatt-hour, because that’s a pretty expensive system,” said Meredith Fowlie, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Today’s lithium-ion batteries can only deliver power for two to four hours before needing to recharge. If costs keep falling, battery companies <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/85878.pdf">might be able to extend that to eight or ten hours</a> (it’s a matter of adding more battery packs) but it may not be economical to go far beyond that, said Nate Blair, an energy storage expert at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->That means additional long-duration storage technologies could be needed. If California wants to rely largely on renewable energy, it will have to handle <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/news-media/energy-droughts-wind-and-solar-can-last-nearly-week-research-shows">weeklong periods where there’s no wind and little sun</a>. Another challenge: There’s far more solar power available in summer than in winter, and no battery today can store electricity for months to manage those seasonal disparities.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Some companies are exploring solutions. In Sacramento, a start-up called ESS <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/long-duration-energy-storage/sacramento-utility-rolls-out-its-first-long-duration-grid-batteries">is building “flow” batteries</a> that store energy in liquid electrolytes and can last 12 hours or longer. Another start-up, Form Energy, <a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/news/2023-12/cec-awards-30-million-100-hour-long-duration-energy-storage-project">is building a 100-hour iron-air battery</a>. These ideas will have to compete against alternatives like nuclear power, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/28/climate/geothermal-energy-projects.html">advanced geothermal</a> or even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/12/climate/green-hydrogen-climate-change.html">using green hydrogen to store electricity</a>.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->California’s regulators say they may need five times as much storage capacity by midcentury, even if it’s unclear which technologies will prevail.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“We’re just at the beginning of this,” said Mr. Phipps of the California Independent System Operator.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><figure role="group" aria-label="image">   <div><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Ross D.

<p>If you’ve ever tried to “future-proof” a purchase by paying for everything you might eventually need up front, you know it can be a sucker’s game. The problem? <em>We can’t actually see the future.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>But today we got our hands on LPCAMM2 for the first time, and this looks like the future to us. LPCAMM2 is a totally modular, repairable, upgradeable memory standard for laptops, using the latest LPDDR chips for maximum speed and efficiency. So instead of overpaying (or under-speccing) based on guesswork about your future memory needs, you’ll hopefully be able to buy your next laptop and then install more RAM as needed. Imagine that!</p>



<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1922" height="1081" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/05/06213451/newmicronram-in-use.jpg" alt="The Micron LPCAMM2 module disassembled next to iFixit tools and laptop parts" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/05/06213451/newmicronram-in-use.jpg 1922w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/05/06213451/newmicronram-in-use-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/05/06213451/newmicronram-in-use-1600x900.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1922px) 100vw, 1922px"></figure>



<p>We say “hopefully” because the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Lenovo_ThinkPad_P1_Gen_7">laptop</a> on our teardown table today is the first of its kind, thanks to a collaboration between <a href="https://www.micron.com/about/blog/memory/dram/lpcamm2-no-compromise-for-next-gen-laptops">Micron</a> and <a href="https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/lenovo-unveils-its-new-ai-ready-thinkpad-p1-gen-7-mobile-workstation/">Lenovo</a>—and it remains to be seen how many other big laptop makers will adopt LPCAMM2 technology. But judging by the results of our initial hands-on, the writing is on the wall for laptops with soldered-down, non-serviceable memory.</p>



<h2><strong>What is LPDDR, and why do manufacturers solder it down?</strong></h2>



<p>Repairable, upgradeable RAM isn’t exactly a new idea. As anyone who has ever built a PC knows, we’ve had swappable DDR RAM sticks (also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIMM#SO-DIMM">DIMMs</a>, or <em>Dual In-Line Memory Modules</em>) since basically forever. From old Gateway towers to today’s gaming powerhouses to zillion-dollar industrial servers, upgradeable and replaceable RAM is still very much a thing. And for many years, the same was true of laptops, which used a slightly more compact (“Small-Outline” DIMM, or <em>SO-DIMM</em>) version of those same RAM sticks.</p>



<p>More recently though, we’ve seen increasing adoption of <em>LPDDR</em>—a <em>low-power</em> flavor of RAM (hence the “LP”) developed for mobile devices like phones and tablets. Whereas conventional DDR RAM excels at performance applications where power consumption isn’t a primary concern, like video editing or gaming, LPDDR wins the day when it comes to efficiency—<em>a.k.a. battery life</em>. And so for laptops in particular, the benefits of LPDDR are hard to beat.</p>



<div><p>The drawback of LPDDR, though, is that it has to be soldered to the main board in close proximity to the processor—making repairs and upgrades completely impractical. But why?</p><p>LPDDR operates at lower voltages compared to DDR, giving it the edge in power efficiency. But, the lower voltage makes signal integrity between the memory and processor challenging, requiring tighter tolerances and shorter trace distances—that is, the farther the signal has to travel, the more voltage you need for a reliable signal. This is why LPDDR is soldered down as close to the processor as possible.</p></div>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1922" height="1081" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/05/06215652/soldered.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/05/06215652/soldered.jpg 1922w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/05/06215652/soldered-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/05/06215652/soldered-1600x900.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1922px) 100vw, 1922px"><figcaption>Historically, LPDDR chips (left) had to be soldered very close to the main processor (right).</figcaption></figure>



<p>In short, laptop makers and consumers alike have faced an unfortunate dilemma: conventional SO-DIMM RAM for serviceability and upgradeability, or soldered LPDDR chips for longer battery life.</p>



<p>Today, that changes.</p>



<h2><strong>Enter LPCAMM2&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Standing for “Low-Power Compression-Attached Memory Module,” the new tech is as the name suggests: LPDDR chips on a compact board that screws in place very close to a laptop’s CPU. Combining the efficiency and speed of LPDDR with a thin, lightweight, upgradeable design and a trick interface that gets everything up close and personal with the CPU, LPCAMM2 seemingly does it all. And with dual-channel performance already baked in, a single LPCAMM2 module can do the job of a pair of the old socketed SO-DIMM sticks with a much smaller footprint and better thermals to boot. Finally: modular, performant, power-efficient laptop memory for the masses.</p>

<p>Even though LPCAMM2 is arriving initially from Micron, in a Lenovo product, the technology owes its existence to an alliance of tech companies working together over the course of several years. The first iteration, known as <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/dell-introduces-camm-ddr5-memory-for-its-new-precision-laptops-up-to-128gb-per-module">CAMM</a>, was an in-house project at Dell, with the first DDR5-equipped CAMM modules installed in Dell Precision 7000 series laptops. And thankfully, after doing the initial R&amp;D to make the tech a reality, Dell didn’t gatekeep. Their engineers believed that the project had such a good chance at becoming the next widespread memory standard that instead of keeping it proprietary, they went the other way and opened it up for standardization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They were right. Only a few short years later, with the blessing of the <a href="https://www.jedec.org/news/pressreleases/jedec-publishes-new-camm2-memory-module-standard">JEDEC</a> standards body, LPCAMM2 is here and ready to take the torch.</p>



<p>Dell is one hero in this story, creating something the tech world sorely needed and then sharing instead of keeping it for themselves. Thankfully, this story is full of heroes: Micron and Lenovo are first to bring LPCAMM2 to market, with <a href="https://semiconductor.samsung.com/dram/module/lpcamm2/">Samsung</a>, <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/adata-demos-next-gen-memory-modules">ADATA</a>, and others backing it as well. Instead of everyone going their own way, they’ve rallied around a new industry standard—meaning an off-the-shelf LPCAMM2 module should theoretically work in any laptop that adopts the technology, regardless of who manufactures it. With the industry as a whole on the same page, backing standards like this, the world becomes a more repairable place.</p>



<h2><strong>Designing for a repairable future</strong></h2>



<p>The advent of LPCAMM2 is especially gratifying for repair advocates, who for years have been told that repairability simply can’t coexist with cutting-edge tech in thin-and-light devices. We’re not ready to accept that, and we’ve long argued that OEMs who are willing to innovate with repairability in mind can do better. Maybe we can’t see the future, but we can envision one that’s more repairable than what we’ve been sold in recent years—and we’re grateful when companies like Micron and Lenovo take the leap to make that future a reality.</p>

<p>LPCAMM2 exemplifies our ability to advance technologically while designing with sustainability in mind. It represents a significant step forward in the fight against planned obsolescence. By fighting for a modular, upgradeable memory solution for chips previously stuck in a soldered hellscape, manufacturers are demonstrating their commitment to creating devices that stand the test of time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s so much to gain here: from increasing device lifespan at schools and businesses, to reducing anxiety for consumers at the point of purchase, to enabling hassle-free repairs for devices that would otherwise be scrapped. As more companies rally behind this standard, we can look forward to a future where more laptops are built to last, and where repairs and upgrades aren’t only possible, but encouraged. There’s no question that the potential for this technology to make a tangible difference is real, and it’s right in front of us.</p>



<p><em>Full Disclosure: iFixit has prior business relationships with both Micron and Lenovo, and we are hopelessly biased in favor of repairable products.</em></p>

<section>
<div><p data-block-key="k2n3w">This blog post is a part of a series about our research toward the next generation of the SecureDrop whistleblowing system. If you haven’t been following along, check out <a href="https://securedrop.org/news/how-to-research-your-own-cryptography-and-survive/">our previous post</a> for some recommended context.</p><p data-block-key="a0kb2">Here, we present a proposed end-to-end encryption protocol for a future version of SecureDrop server, accompanied by a brief discussion of various aspects of the protocol and our next steps.</p></div>
<a id="protocol_overview"></a>
<div><h2 data-block-key="amiet">Protocol overview</h2><p data-block-key="4ha31">We present a proof-of-concept protocol with the following core properties, which are derived from the research and threat modeling concerns <a href="https://securedrop.org/news/how-to-research-your-own-cryptography-and-survive/#design_challenges">previously discussed</a>:</p><ol><li data-block-key="6gel2">No accounts, and therefore no user authentication;</li><li data-block-key="es209">No message flow metadata, meaning messages can’t be linked together, and different types of messages are indistinguishable from one another;</li><li data-block-key="3ag4">No changes in server state are observable externally;</li><li data-block-key="520s9">No ciphertext collection or information leaks via trial decryption – a given recipient receives pertinent ciphertext only.</li></ol><p data-block-key="d3vce">The protocol has a simple API with only three endpoints: <code>send</code>, <code>fetch</code>, and <code>download</code>. Sources’ and journalists’ requests to these endpoints are structured identically, to make them harder for a compromised server or network adversary to distinguish. The server’s response is unique for each request, to avoid leaking information about server state.</p><p data-block-key="5ebcm">It uses well-established cryptographic primitives (currently <code>libsodium</code> for proof-of-concept purposes), achieving end-to-end encryption and one-way forward secrecy <a href="https://securedrop.org/news/how-to-research-your-own-cryptography-and-survive/#new_protocol_requirements">for messages flowing from source to journalist</a>. The server has access to minimal metadata, theoretically opening the door to deployment in adversarial environments.</p><p data-block-key="dlbh0">Along with this blog post, we’re also publishing:</p></div>
<a id="repo_link"></a>
<div><ul><li data-block-key="ds4bc">A <a href="https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-protocol">proof-of-concept GitHub repository</a> that demonstrates the end-to-end protocol and documents how it works;</li><li data-block-key="911qd">And a <a href="https://securedrop.org/documents/31/202401_SecureDrop_Protocol_Audit_Report_mmaker.pdf">preliminary audit</a>, which also contains a concise summary of the protocol.</li></ul><p data-block-key="ck31n"><b>This is proof-of-concept code and is not intended for production use</b>. The protocol details are not yet finalized.</p></div>
<a id="discussion"></a>
<div><h2 data-block-key="9v8mk">Discussion</h2><p data-block-key="4vdmm">Let’s contextualize the four notable properties of the SecureDrop Protocol as enumerated above.</p><p data-block-key="aj4m4">The first property arises from the desire to <a href="https://securedrop.org/news/anatomy-of-a-whistleblowing-system/#deniability">maximize plausible deniability</a> for the source in a variety of situations, including repeated snapshotting of the server. The motivation for the second property is evident, but the implementation is less trivial: it’s one thing to <a href="https://signal.org/blog/sealed-sender/">conceal a sender</a>, but how does a server deliver a message to an unknown recipient? One approach is trial decryption — deliver all ciphertext to everyone, and valid recipients will determine locally which messages belong to them based on what their own secret keys can decrypt. But besides being inefficient, this would also introduce an information leak: it would allow anyone to constantly monitor the server state and know when messages are added and deleted, observe message upload patterns, and so on. In the context of a relatively low-traffic self-hosted system, this would represent a significant metadata leak, thus the need for our third property.</p><p data-block-key="g2vk">Finally, one of our additional goals is a graceful degradation of security properties, in case of different degrees of user or server compromise. Allowing anyone on the internet to observe ciphertext would allow for “harvest now, decrypt later” attacks, so the fourth property reflects the need to guard against such possibilities.</p></div>
<a id="comparison"></a>
<p><h3 data-block-key="k2n3w">Comparison of messaging protocols</h3></p>
<p><img alt="At-a-glance message protocol comparison" src="https://media.securedrop.org/media/images/message_protocol_comparison.width-1440.svg" srcset="https://media.securedrop.org/media/images/message_protocol_comparison.width-2880.svg 2x">
</p>
<small>1. While there isn’t a single standard library, the implementation is straightforward. <br>
2. <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/534.pdf">New iteration of the research focuses on groups.</a> <br>
3. SecureDrop Protocol does not preclude scalability, but scaling to mass adoption level (i.e. millions of users) is a <a href="https://securedrop.org/news/how-to-research-your-own-cryptography-and-survive/#design_principles">nonrequirement</a> for our purposes.</small>
<div><p data-block-key="k2n3w">The following is a highly simplified comparison of real-world message delivery approaches.</p><h4 data-block-key="9vu"><b>Trial decryption</b></h4></div>
<p><img alt="Trial Decryption" src="https://media.securedrop.org/media/images/trial_decryption.width-1440.svg" srcset="https://media.securedrop.org/media/images/trial_decryption.width-2880.svg 2x">
</p>
<div><p data-block-key="7gjk9">Trial decryption is a simple way to conceal recipient information. Payloads are encrypted for a given recipient, which in turn has full visibility of all the payloads in the system. As the name suggests, a recipient will discover which messages belong to them by trying to decrypt all the messages they receive.</p><p data-block-key="20l4e">Benefits to this approach include symmetry among user traffic (all users download all payloads) and lack of account creation requirement. Limitations include the lack of scalability, the information leak mentioned above, and the ability for an arbitrary attacker to collect payloads/ciphertext. This approach would satisfy requirements 1 and 2 (lack of accounts, lack of message flow metadata), but not 3 and 4 (externally-observable server state, bulk ciphertext collection).</p></div>
<div><h4 data-block-key="boqeg"><b>Signal Protocol</b></h4></div>
<p><img alt="Signal Protocol" src="https://media.securedrop.org/media/images/signal_protocol.width-1440.svg" srcset="https://media.securedrop.org/media/images/signal_protocol.width-2880.svg 2x">
</p>
<div><p data-block-key="e3aqs">Signal relies on accounts for both message submission and delivery. Only authenticated users can submit messages, and recipients must be specified outside the encrypted payload in order for the server to deliver the pertinent payloads at the next recipient login and fetch.</p><p data-block-key="2q0l">This message delivery approach has high delivery reliability, and is resource-efficient for the recipient, since only pertinent payloads are being downloaded and decrypted, but it would not support our transition towards a less trusted server. It satisfies properties 3 and 4 (no externally-observable server state changes, no bulk ciphertext collection), but not 1 and 2 (accounts, message flow metadata).</p></div>
<div><h4 data-block-key="bj0re"><b>Oblivious Message Detection/Retrieval (OMD/OMR)</b></h4></div>
<p><img alt="Oblivious Message Detection/Retrieval" src="https://media.securedrop.org/media/images/omd_omr.width-1440.svg" srcset="https://media.securedrop.org/media/images/omd_omr.width-2880.svg 2x">
</p>
<div><p data-block-key="a9b6l"><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1256.pdf">Oblivious Message Detection and Retrieval is a newer message delivery mechanism</a> aimed at concealing the recipient and addressing the scalability issues of trial decryption by, in very broad terms, mixing pertinent and non-pertinent payloads, and using one or more “detector” servers to heuristically group, as well as distinguish, pertinent and non-pertinent content for a given user based on the “clues” assigned to each payload. (The idea of detecting/delivering messages in a way that makes them differentiable only by the receiver is an active research area; see also <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/089.pdf">Fuzzy Message Detection</a>.)</p><p data-block-key="f8mf3">Fuzzy message delivery is less feasible for small-scale systems like SecureDrop, where a burdensome level of decoy traffic would be required. In addition, OMR uses homomorphic encryption and other constructs that, at the time of writing, are relatively new, and pose some design challenges. The combination of the protocol's complexity and the bleeding-edge nature of some of the protocol's components gave us pause, although <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/534.pdf">research in this area</a>, particularly that focused on group messaging, is promising.</p></div>
<div><h4 data-block-key="cj7r2"><b>SecureDrop Protocol</b></h4></div>
<p><img alt="SecureDrop Protocol" src="https://media.securedrop.org/media/images/securedrop_protocol.width-1440.svg" srcset="https://media.securedrop.org/media/images/securedrop_protocol.width-2880.svg 2x">
</p>
<div><p data-block-key="3cemv">As with OMR, in the SecureDrop Protocol a sender sends the payload and a “clue” without any authentication. The recipient anonymously asks the server for clues, and the server serves both clues and decoys on every request. Every time a message-fetching request is made to the server, the response contains a new combination of clue and decoy ciphertext. Since every request returns a different response, and since the ciphertext is indistinguishable without being able to decrypt one or more of the clues, individual requests do not leak information about server state changes.</p><p data-block-key="60qe6">Message-fetching is a two-step operation. The recipient requests clues, and attempts trial decryption on them. For each successfully-decrypted clue, the recipient discovers a <code>message_id</code>. The <code>message_id</code> is a cryptographically unguessable value generated by the server upon message submission and kept private from all other parties. When an anonymous user discovers a <code>message_id</code>, they are able to fetch the corresponding message payload from the server. This two-step process is an optimization-related implementation detail, not a security measure.</p></div>
<a id="securedrop_protocol_details"></a>
<div><h3 data-block-key="6qff5">SecureDrop Protocol in detail</h3><p data-block-key="er4gd">Understanding SecureDrop Protocol’s message retrieval mechanism requires a basic understanding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange#Generalization_to_finite_cyclic_groups">classical Diffie-Hellman key agreement</a>. In particular, we take advantage of the notable properties that key agreement is commutative and can be extended to any number of parties.</p></div>
<p><img alt="SecureDrop Protocol - Multi-party async Diffie-Hellman" src="https://media.securedrop.org/media/images/sd_detail_async_multiparty_dh.width-1440.svg" srcset="https://media.securedrop.org/media/images/sd_detail_async_multiparty_dh.width-2880.svg 2x">
</p>
<center><small><i>Asynchronous three party Diffie-Hellman between sender, server, and recipient</i></small></center>
<div><p data-block-key="k2n3w">This diagram shows how the recipient of a message can agree with the server on a shared key <i>K</i> without learning anything about the state of the server – while preventing the server from knowing whether the recipient is indeed the intended one. Every <i>K</i> is obtained using: long-term key material, which later allows the correct recipient to detect their pertinent messages; per-message ephemeral key material, which introduces unlinkability between messages addressed to the same recipient; and per-request ephemeral key material via “remixed” clues, which provides unlinkability between message-fetching requests, since the clues are transformed before every request.</p><p data-block-key="f35a0">As shown in the next diagram, this scheme allows the server to obliviously encrypt and transfer some information using symmetric key <i>K</i>, without knowing if the requesting recipient will be able to decrypt it.</p></div>
<p><img alt="Oblivious Transfer of message_id" src="https://media.securedrop.org/media/images/securedrop_protocol_oblivious_transfer_messag.width-1440.svg" srcset="https://media.securedrop.org/media/images/securedrop_protocol_oblivious_transfer_messag.width-2880.svg 2x">
</p>
<center><small><i>Detail of the oblivious transfer of a message_id between the server and a recipient</i></small></center>
<div><p data-block-key="k2n3w">The material that is <i>obliviously-transferred</i> is the <code>message_id</code>, a securely random, unguessable value that the server generates upon message submission. Conceptually, it can be thought of as a server-side message uuid. Its main purpose is to keep clue sizes small, rather than encrypting and remixing full message payloads.</p><p data-block-key="euj75">Leveraging the commutativity of multi-party Diffie-Hellman to achieve unlinkability between requests is an uncommon application. We credit this contribution to former SecureDrop team member <a href="https://niij.org/">Michael Z</a>, who <a href="https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-protocol/issues/16">resolved</a> what was a multi-month sticking point in our research.</p></div>
<p><img alt="SecureDrop Protocol: Message-Fetching Example" src="https://media.securedrop.org/media/images/sd_protocol_message_fetch_sample.width-1440.svg" srcset="https://media.securedrop.org/media/images/sd_protocol_message_fetch_sample.width-2880.svg 2x">
</p>
<center><small><i>Sample visualization of five fetch attempts from two valid and three invalid recipients, from a server containing 3 messages (values are symbolic)</i></small></center>
<p data-block-key="k2n3w">Why is the server “untrusted” if it generates secret key material? The server is “untrusted” in the sense that it should learn nothing about users and messages besides what is inherently observable from its pattern of requests, and it should not have access to sensitive metadata, or sender or receiver information. What the server must know are ciphertext payloads and associated clues that need to be stored. In this regard, the server is still a “privileged” asset that should not be queryable by anyone on the internet. That is why the server contributes with an ephemeral key: to hide its state and thus render all requests unlinkable to any change of such state.</p>
<a id="encryption"></a>
<p><h3 data-block-key="2k0v1">SecureDrop Protocol: encryption properties</h3></p>
<div><h4 data-block-key="e8es9"><b>Message retrieval symmetry despite source-journalist asymmetry</b></h4><p data-block-key="6uekb">Until now, we have commonly used the terms <i>sender</i> and <i>recipient</i> to indicate a role that a user can have. In classical messaging applications, all users can both receive messages and initiate conversations. In whistleblowing applications, the anonymized party (<i>source)</i> initiates communication with the trusted party (<i>journalist</i>). Our previous blog post outlines the difference in their endpoint requirements in detail, and describes the limitations on the type of key material that a source can have.</p><p data-block-key="eo80i">So, while both journalists and sources will use the same message retrieval mechanism and the same submission mechanism (and in practice, the same API endpoints), and are treated indistinguishably from the server’s perspective, their key setup is inherently different. This difference of roles and setup has a significant impact on the encryption properties we can achieve, especially in three areas: forward secrecy, participant authentication, and deniability.</p></div>
<div><h4 data-block-key="4cg4a"><b>Forward secrecy: It’s imperfect</b></h4><p data-block-key="4rthf">Forward secrecy requires ephemeral keys, implying an evolving state with some non-predictable, non-deterministic source of entropy. Forward secrecy requires that both parties use per-message ephemeral keys, and is commonly achieved by periodically re-generating secret-key material and then discarding it, like an automatic key-rotation procedure. Our <a href="https://securedrop.org/news/how-to-research-your-own-cryptography-and-survive/#design_principles">design constraints</a> allow for source-to-journalist forward secrecy, by rotating some journalist encryption key, but not vice versa: for usability reasons, we do not want to rotate a source passphrase, and we cannot add non-deterministic key material on the source side, since we <a href="https://securedrop.org/news/how-to-research-your-own-cryptography-and-survive/#design_challenges">cannot store it anywhere</a>. We consider the anonymity of the source a higher priority than the confidentiality of the material, so under these circumstances we accept this “one-way” form of forward secrecy.</p><h4 data-block-key="14ak5"><b>Participant authentication</b></h4><p data-block-key="50bl1">Consider a simple Diffie-Hellman key-agreement used with per-message ephemeral keys used for symmetric message encryption. A Diffie-Hellman key agreement is performed between the secret part of the per-message key and the public component of the recipient.</p><p data-block-key="73k5i">This kind of key agreement is unauthenticated: the recipient has no implicit or explicit proof that a particular sender sent that public key and ciphertext. This does not matter for a “first contact” message, which by definition comes from an anonymous/unknown party, but for ongoing conversations, some measure of participant authentication is required – essentially, to ensure that the source who began the conversation is indeed the one who is continuing it.</p><p data-block-key="fpefs">The question of participant authentication is an open problem that is interlinked with deniability. We see several fairly straightforward ways of addressing it; more discussion can be found <a href="https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-protocol/issues/30">here</a>.</p><h4 data-block-key="1subm"><b>Deniability for sources</b></h4><p data-block-key="7ljhr">There are multiple layers at which SecureDrop seeks to create deniability: forensic deniability on a source’s own machine; forensic deniability on the server of the existence of a given source; and message-level cryptographic deniability.</p><p data-block-key="2uev3">The first forensic <a href="https://securedrop.org/news/anatomy-of-a-whistleblowing-system/#deniability">deniability property</a> is discussed at length in our previous posts and is orthogonal to the protocol; broadly, we satisfy it by avoiding writing to disk on the source’s machine. The second type of forensic deniability is served by the lack of server-side accounts; the only way to prove that a given party exists is to gain ciphertext addressed to them (a pending message) along with their key material.</p><p data-block-key="6v088">Conversation-level and message-level deniability require a more detailed discussion.</p><p data-block-key="9mvav">In cryptographic terms, deniability is often called <a href="https://cypherpunks.ca/~iang/pubs/dake-ccs15.pdf">repudiation</a>, of which participation repudiation and message repudiation are two forms. Repudiation and authentication are both important security principles, and yet, in some ways they appear at odds with one another: how can a protocol offer both authentication <i>and</i> the ability to deny sending a message or being part of a conversation?</p><p data-block-key="279as">The Signal Protocol does offer <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/x3dh/x3dh.pdf">both repudiation attributes and implicit participant authentication</a> under <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/642.pdf">certain conditions</a>, via a clever use of multiple Diffie-Hellman key exchanges. Broadly, the implicit authentication comes from the use of long-term identity keys, while the deniability comes from the combination of approximately-discoverable public keys (via phone number/username, on Signal’s servers) and the idea that, while both parties must agree on a shared key to facilitate their conversation, neither party must sign their individual messages. Hypothetically, a conversation between two parties could be forged by one of the parties, providing the other with a measure of deniability.</p><p data-block-key="l7va">By contrast, the SecureDrop Protocol cannot provide conversation-level repudiation in cases where an ongoing source-journalist conversation is desired. This is because, while journalist public key material can and must be publicly discoverable so that anonymous sources can contact them, sources do <i>not</i> publish their public key material, and must attach it in their first-contact message so that journalists can reply, proving their participation in at least this initial message.</p><p data-block-key="dmq50">SecureDrop Protocol could theoretically support two modes: a true “dead drop” mode from a source that never intends to return or receive replies, and a conversational mode, in which the source expects to return and continue correspondence. In the former, the source achieves full deniability. In the latter, which is the more typical use-case, individual message repudiation can be achieved (as can participant authentication, mentioned above), but participation repudiation cannot. This issue is an area of <a href="https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop-protocol/issues/30">ongoing research</a>.</p></div>

<div><h4 data-block-key="k2n3w"><b>Putting it all together: message-fetching and encryption</b></h4><p data-block-key="1of6f">The following is a simplified illustration of the message-fetching and encryption in the SecureDrop Protocol.

</p>
<a id="primitives"></a>
<div><h3 data-block-key="k2n3w">Cryptographic primitives</h3><p data-block-key="1j0ae">The proof-of-concept implementation uses <a href="https://doc.libsodium.org/">libsodium</a> for both key-agreement and symmetric encryption. That means, as of now, that our <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/key_exchange#algorithm-details">DH exchanges are powered by X25519</a> and our <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/secret-key_cryptography/secretbox#algorithm-details">authenticated symmetric encryption is powered by XSalsa20 and Poly1305 MAC</a>.</p><h4 data-block-key="293rs"><b>Post-quantum security?</b></h4><p data-block-key="3mbhl">Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman is not considered quantum-safe. There are various key encapsulation mechanisms we could make use of that are appropriate for encryption, however, we have not yet found a post-quantum-secure solution for the message-fetching mechanism in the protocol, which requires the commutative properties of multi-party ECDH discussed above.</p><p data-block-key="5m08n">The multi-party mechanism we describe is used to protect anonymized metadata from leaking information about the state of the server over time, similar to a network-level correlation attack. One possibility is a hybrid model where messages themselves (including their sender information and other metadata) are encrypted in a quantum-safe manner, while the message-retrieval mechanism remains usable with less future-proofing.</p><p data-block-key="ebh32">That said, this protocol will not transition to production-readiness until a thorough post-quantum security assessment has taken place.</p><p data-block-key="73bjq">Post-quantum readiness is an open research topic that we do not have the resources to address alone; we are grateful for the offers of assistance with post-quantum readiness that we have received, and we welcome additional collaboration in this area!</p></div>
<a id="audit"></a>
<div><h3 data-block-key="k2n3w">Preliminary audit</h3><p data-block-key="5hsep">In November 2023, we engaged cryptographic researcher <a href="https://michele.orru.net/">Michele Orrù</a> for a preliminary audit of the protocol and some of our claimed security properties, with a focus on the server state hiding and message unlinkability.

                 <div><strong><span>CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA</span> </strong>Apple today unveiled the groundbreaking new iPad Pro in a stunningly thin and light design, taking portability and performance to the next level. Available in silver and space black finishes, the new <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/" target="_blank">iPad Pro</a> comes in two sizes: an expansive 13-inch model and a super-portable 11-inch model. Both sizes feature the world’s most advanced display — a new breakthrough Ultra Retina XDR display with state-of-the-art tandem OLED technology — providing a remarkable visual experience. The new iPad Pro is made possible with the new M4 chip, the next generation of Apple silicon, which delivers a huge leap in performance and capabilities. M4 features an entirely new display engine to enable the precision, color, and brightness of the Ultra Retina XDR display. With a new CPU, a next-generation GPU that builds upon the GPU architecture debuted on M3, and the most powerful Neural Engine yet, the new iPad Pro is an outrageously powerful device for artificial intelligence. The versatility and advanced capabilities of iPad Pro are also enhanced with all-new accessories. <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/" target="_blank">Apple Pencil Pro</a> brings powerful new interactions that take the pencil experience even further, and a new thinner, lighter <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-keyboards/" target="_blank">Magic Keyboard</a> is packed with incredible features. The new iPad Pro, Apple Pencil Pro, and Magic Keyboard are available to order starting today, with availability in stores beginning Wednesday, May 15.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>“iPad Pro empowers a broad set of pros and is perfect for anyone who wants the ultimate iPad experience — with its combination of the world’s best displays, extraordinary performance of our latest M-series chips, and advanced accessories — all in a portable design. Today, we’re taking it even further with the new, stunningly thin and light iPad Pro, our biggest update ever to iPad Pro,” said John Ternus, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Engineering. “With the breakthrough Ultra Retina XDR display, the next-level performance of M4, incredible AI capabilities, and support for the all-new Apple Pencil Pro and Magic Keyboard, there’s no device like the new iPad Pro.”

                 <div>The new iPad Pro — the thinnest Apple product ever — features a stunningly thin and light design, taking portability to a whole new level. The 11-inch model is just 5.3 mm thin, and the 13-inch model is even thinner at a striking 5.1 mm, while both models are just as strong as the previous design. The 11-inch model weighs less than a pound, and the 13-inch model is nearly a quarter pound lighter than its predecessor — allowing pro users to extend their workflows in new ways and in more places. The new iPad Pro is available in two gorgeous finishes — silver and space black — both with 100 percent recycled aluminum enclosures.

                 <div>The new iPad Pro debuts the Ultra Retina XDR, the world’s most advanced display, to provide an even more remarkable visual experience. The Ultra Retina XDR display features state-of-the-art tandem OLED technology that uses two OLED panels and combines the light from both to provide phenomenal full-screen brightness. The new iPad Pro supports an incredible 1000 nits of full-screen brightness for SDR and HDR content, and 1600 nits peak for HDR. No other device of its kind delivers this level of extreme dynamic range. Tandem OLED technology enables sub-millisecond control over the color and luminance of each pixel, taking XDR precision further than ever. Specular highlights in photos and video appear even brighter, and there’s more detail in shadows and low light than ever before on iPad — all while delivering even more responsiveness to content in motion. For pro users working in high-end, color-managed workflows or challenging lighting conditions, a new nano-texture glass option comes to iPad Pro for the first time.<sup>1</sup> Nano-texture glass is precisely etched at a nanometer scale, maintaining image quality and contrast while scattering ambient light for reduced glare. With its breakthrough tandem OLED technology, extreme brightness, incredibly precise contrast, brilliant colors, and nano-texture glass option, the new Ultra Retina XDR display is the world’s most advanced display, giving iPad Pro customers an unparalleled viewing experience.

                 <div>The incredibly thin and light design and game-changing display of the new iPad Pro is only possible with M4, the next generation of Apple silicon that delivers a huge leap in performance. M4 is built on second-generation 3-nanometer technology that’s even more power efficient, which is perfect for the design of the new iPad Pro. With an entirely new display engine, M4 introduces pioneering technology for the stunning precision, color, and brightness of the Ultra Retina XDR display. The new CPU offers up to four performance cores and now six efficiency cores,<sup>2</sup> with next-generation machine learning (ML) accelerators, to deliver up to 1.5x faster CPU performance over M2 in the previous-generation iPad Pro.<sup>3</sup> M4 builds on the GPU architecture of M3 — the 10-core GPU includes powerful features like Dynamic Caching, and hardware-accelerated mesh shading and ray tracing, which come to iPad for the first time. Coupled with higher unified memory bandwidth, pro rendering apps like Octane will see up to 4x faster performance than M2.<sup>3</sup> M4 also delivers tremendous gains and industry-leading performance per watt. Compared to M2, M4 can deliver the same performance using just half the power, and compared to the latest PC chip in a thin and light laptop, M4 can deliver the same performance using just a quarter of the power.<sup>4</sup> A new advanced Media Engine includes support for AV1 decode, providing more power-efficient playback of high-resolution video experiences from streaming services.

Cellular models of the new iPad Pro are activated with eSIM, a more secure alternative to a physical SIM card, allowing users to quickly connect and transfer their existing plans digitally, and store multiple cellular plans on a single device. Customers can easily get connected to wireless data plans on the new iPad Pro in over 190 countries and regions around the world without needing to get a physical SIM card from a local carrier.

                 <h2><strong>Apple Pencil Pro</strong>
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Apple Pencil Pro features even more magical capabilities and powerful new interactions that take the Apple Pencil experience even further. A new sensor in the barrel can sense a user’s squeeze, bringing up a tool palette to quickly switch tools, line weights, and colors, all without interrupting the creative process. A custom<em> </em>haptic engine delivers a light tap that provides confirmation when users squeeze, use double-tap, or snap to a Smart Shape for a remarkably intuitive experience. A gyroscope allows users to roll Apple Pencil Pro for precise control of the tool they’re using. Rotating the barrel changes the orientation of shaped pen and brush tools, just like pen and paper. And with Apple Pencil hover, users can visualize the exact orientation of a tool before making a mark.

Apple Pencil Pro brings support for Find My for the first time to Apple Pencil, helping users locate Apple Pencil Pro if misplaced. It pairs, charges, and is stored on the side of iPad Pro through a new magnetic interface. iPad Pro also supports Apple Pencil (USB-C), ideal for note taking, sketching, annotating, journaling, and more, at an incredible value.

                 <div>Designed for the new iPad Pro, an all-new thinner and lighter Magic Keyboard makes it more portable and versatile than ever. The new Magic Keyboard opens to the magical floating design that customers love, and now includes a function row for access to features like screen brightness and volume controls. It also has a gorgeous aluminum palm rest and larger trackpad that’s even more responsive with haptic feedback, so the entire experience feels just like using a MacBook. The new Magic Keyboard attaches magnetically, and the Smart Connector immediately connects power and data without the need for Bluetooth. The machined aluminum hinge also includes a USB-C connector for charging. The new Magic Keyboard comes in two colors that perfectly complement the new iPad Pro: black with a space black aluminum palm rest, and white with a silver aluminum palm rest.

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>iPadOS is packed with features that push the boundaries of what’s possible on iPad. With Reference Mode, iPadOS can precisely match color requirements of the Ultra Retina XDR display for tasks in which accurate colors and consistent image quality are critical — including review and approve, color grading, and compositing. Stage Manager enables users to work with multiple overlapping windows in a single view, resize windows, tap to switch between apps, and more. With full external display support of up to 6K, iPad Pro users can also extend their workflow, as well as use the built-in camera on an external display for enhanced video conferencing. Users can take advantage of the powerful AI capabilities in iPad Pro and intelligent features in iPadOS, including Visual Look Up, Subject Lift, Live Text, or Live Captions and Personal Voice for accessibility.

                 <div>With <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipados/ipados-17/" target="_blank">iPadOS 17</a>, users can customize the Lock Screen to make it more personal — taking advantage of the larger display on iPad — and interactive widgets take glanceable information further with the ability to get tasks done right in the moment with just a tap. The Notes app gives users new ways to organize, read, annotate, and collaborate on PDFs, and working with PDFs is also easier with AutoFill, which intelligently identifies and fills fields in forms.

                 <div><span>CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA</span> Apple today announced M4, the latest chip delivering phenomenal performance to the all-new <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/" target="_blank">iPad Pro</a>. Built using second-generation 3-nanometer technology, M4 is a system on a chip (SoC) that advances the industry-leading power efficiency of Apple silicon and enables the incredibly thin design of iPad Pro. It also features an entirely new display engine to drive the stunning precision, color, and brightness of the breakthrough Ultra Retina XDR display on iPad Pro. A new CPU has up to 10 cores, while the new 10-core GPU builds on the next-generation GPU architecture introduced in M3, and brings Dynamic Caching, hardware-accelerated ray tracing, and hardware-accelerated mesh shading to iPad for the first time. M4 has Apple’s fastest Neural Engine ever, capable of up to 38 trillion operations per second, which is faster than the neural processing unit of any AI PC today. Combined with faster memory bandwidth, along with next-generation machine learning (ML) accelerators in the CPU, and a high-performance GPU, M4 makes the new iPad Pro an outrageously powerful device for artificial intelligence.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>“The new iPad Pro with M4 is a great example of how building best-in-class custom silicon enables breakthrough products,” said Johny Srouji, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Technologies. “The power-efficient performance of M4, along with its new display engine, makes the thin design and game-changing display of iPad Pro possible, while fundamental improvements to the CPU, GPU, Neural Engine, and memory system make M4 extremely well suited for the latest applications leveraging AI. Altogether, this new chip makes iPad Pro the most powerful device of its kind.”

                 <div>M4 has a blazing-fast Neural Engine — an IP block in the chip dedicated to the acceleration of AI workloads. This is Apple’s most powerful Neural Engine ever, capable of an astounding 38 trillion operations per second — a breathtaking 60x faster than the first Neural Engine in A11 Bionic. Together with next-generation ML accelerators in the CPU, the high-performance GPU, and higher-bandwidth unified memory, the Neural Engine makes M4 an outrageously powerful chip for AI. And with AI features in iPadOS like Live Captions for real-time audio captions, and Visual Look Up, which identifies objects in video and photos, the new iPad Pro allows users to accomplish amazing AI tasks quickly and on device.

										<p>I’ve paid over $350,000 of rent in my life. That averages out to $2,500 a month since mid 2012. And, with near record interest rates and elevated home prices, I may end up paying another $350,000 in rent before I ever buy a house.</p>
<p>I am a part of what you might call the Forever Renter class. This is a cohort of people in their mid-20s to late-30s who are either <em>unwilling</em> or <em>unable</em> to buy a home under current market conditions. Unfortunately, those conditions aren’t moving in the right direction either. As <a href="https://www.redfin.com/news/housing-market-update-home-prices-costs-record-high/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redfin recently reported</a>, “The median U.S. home-sale price hit a record $383,725 during the four weeks ending April 21, up 5.2% from a year earlier.”</p>
<p>But it’s not just the median U.S. home that is setting records. Homes in many high cost of living areas are near their highs as well. Last month <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/million-dollar-cities-2024-33891/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zillow reported</a> that there are now a record 550 “Million-Dollar” cities in the United States. These are cities where the <em>typical</em> home price is greater than $1 million. While nearly half of these Million-Dollar cities are in California, the New York metropolitan area has the most with 106:</p>

<p>But rising home prices are just one factor impacting affordability. High interest rates are another.</p>
<p>The 30-Year mortgage rate peaked last October at 7.8% before dropping through year end. At the time, the worst of it seemed to be over. However, with inflation coming in hotter than expected this year, many believe that the Fed <a href="https://x.com/biancoresearch/status/1785294648212390216" target="_blank">will no longer cut rates as planned</a> in 2024. As a result, mortgage rates have started creeping up yet again with the 30-Year near 7.2% today:</p>

Incomes haven’t risen in lockstep with housing prices and mortgage rates. For example, <a href="https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/hai-02-2024-housing-affordability-index-2024-04-12.pdf?_gl=1*15hok00*_gcl_au*NTEzNTgwMTMxLjE3MTQ0MTEzNTk." target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the National Association of Realtors</a>, the median family income increased by 18% from $85,806 to $100,876 between 2021 and February 2024.</p>
<p>However, over the same time period, the monthly mortgage payment required to purchase the median U.S. home doubled:</p>

<p>So while American families were getting an 18% raise, their prospective housing cost increased by 100%. Technically, the median sales price for new houses in the U.S. has dropped by 13% since their peak in late 2022:</p>

<p>However, this has done very little to affect affordability. Since rates are still so high, the American Dream remains out of reach for so many.</p>
<p>This is why the Forever Renter class exists. Though incomes have increased, housing costs have increased by far more. It’s gotten so bad that <a href="https://zillow.mediaroom.com/2024-02-29-Home-buyers-need-to-earn-47,000-more-than-in-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zillow estimated</a> that homebuyers need to earn nearly $50,000 more today than in 2020 to comfortably afford a home. And, in some cities in California, the amount of additional income needed exceeds $100,000!</p>
<p>But, this only addresses a portion of the Forever Renter class—those who are <em>unable</em> to buy a home. It ignores those who can afford to buy one, but choose not to. Because, even if you could buy a house in this market, should you?</p>
<h2>The Unwilling Buyers</h2>
<p>For those that have the means to purchase a home in the current housing market, they may still choose not to if renting is much cheaper. While the numbers vary by location, <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/should-you-rent-or-buy-a-house/">I ran an analysis a few weeks ago</a> that suggests that renting has the upper hand in many high cost cities.</p>
<p>For example, in a place like NYC, a Forever Renter could end up having to decide between paying $4,000 a month <em>to rent</em> or $7,000 a month <em>to buy</em> the same apartment. Even if they could afford such a high housing cost, would that be better than renting and investing the extra $3,000 a month into a diversified portfolio? My conservative estimate suggests not. For the time being, renting wins out.</p>
<p>This is where many in the <em>unwilling</em> Forever Renter class find themselves. They have good jobs. They make good money. But interest rates are also the highest they have been in two decades. As a result, if they want to borrow money to buy a house, they will pay for it dearly.</p>
<p>Given this, their best course of action may be to forego the mortgage market altogether and save up enough money to buy a house in cash. If that is too difficult, they could at least trying saving up a larger downpayment instead. Rather than putting the standard 20% down, maybe they put 50% down. Anything that helps them reduce the amount of money that they borrow at high rates would be a win.</p>
<p>Alternatively, they could use a “wait and see” approach as well. Maybe they start by saving for a larger downpayment, but if rates drop to a more suitable level sooner, then they pull the trigger and buy a house.</p>
<p>No matter how the future plays out, being flexible with your planning can go a long way in helping you make the right financial decision.&nbsp;And, in the event that the immediate future doesn’t play out in your favor, remember that “forever” isn’t as long as it seems.</p>
<h2>Forever Isn’t Forever</h2>
<p>&nbsp;As much as I want to go on about the woes of the Forever Renter class, they may not stay as Forever Renters for all too long. The problem with a lot of financial opinions (mine included) is that they can be far too short-sighted. We overindex on what’s happening right now and extrapolate that out into the future. But that’s almost never how the future actually turns out.</p>
<p>Just go back in time with me five years to May 2019. Imagine all the forecasts, price targets, and predictions that were made in that year. How many of them turned out to be right? None. Not a single one predicted what happened in the next year. And I wouldn’t expect them to.</p>
<p>The same thing will be true with regards to the U.S. housing market. Right now things look bleak. The vast majority of 20 and 30 somethings can’t afford a home today. But this doesn’t mean that they won’t be able to afford one later. Just look at what is happening in Austin, Texas as an example of what could be. Developers started building more homes and prices <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-25/larry-ellison-s-austin-snub-adds-to-city-s-housing-office-woes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have dropped by 18% since May 2022</a>. Increasing supply works. Go figure.</p>
<p>Of course, this won’t happen everywhere (for a host of reasons). But it illustrates how a difficult situation is unlikely to stay difficult indefinitely. Something’s got to give. A solution will present itself. Whether that solution is the one we want is another story entirely. In the meantime, here are some options that can help you during your “forever renter” period:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Earn more</strong>: If you feel like you will be forever priced out of the housing market, start finding ways to earn more. I know this won’t help in the short run, but <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/paychecks-not-portfolios/">raising your income</a> is the best thing you can do to improve your financial situation in the long run. If you have both Saturday and Sunday off every single week, then there is no excuse to get started on <em>something</em> that can eventually increase your earnings.</li>
<li><strong>Consider other housing arrangements</strong>: Being more open with where you live and who you live with as you wait for market conditions to improve. Living with roommates, moving to a lower cost of living area, or downsizing can help reduce your living costs temporarily as you save up to buy your desired home.</li>
<li><strong>Be flexible</strong>: Buying a home will likely be the biggest financial decision of your life, so don’t rush into it. This is especially true in an unfavorable housing market. Be willing to adjust your timeline and keep saving until the right opportunity comes along. When things aren’t looking good, being flexible enough to wait out the storm has its advantages.</li>
</ul>
<p>While things don’t look great now, I am a firm believer that the housing market will become less daunting…eventually. Until then, happy investing and thank you for reading.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Microsoft has closed a number of Bethesda studios, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/redfall">Redfall</a> maker Arkane Austin, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-evil-within">The Evil Within</a> developer Tango Gameworks, and more in devastating cuts at Bethesda, IGN can confirm.</p><p>Alpha Dog Games, maker of mobile game <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/mighty-doom">Mighty Doom</a>, will also close. Roundhouse Studios will be absorbed by <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online">The Elder Scrolls Online</a> developer ZeniMax Online Studios. Microsoft, currently valued at over $3 trillion, did not say how many staff will lose their jobs, but significant layoffs are inevitable. IGN has asked Bethesda for comment. Microsoft declined to expand further when contacted by IGN.</p><p>On Redfall, the disastrous vampire co-op game will now not receive promised updates, including an offline mode and new character DLC, as Microsoft has ended all development on the game. Microsoft said Redfall will remain online to play, and it will provide a "make-good" offer for those who bought the Hero DLC.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Signup here <a href="https://t.co/wb1R4m4emj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/wb1R4m4emj</a> to receive details on how eligible players can receive this credit. <a href="https://t.co/69Os17kpQ8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/69Os17kpQ8</a></p>— Arkane Studios (@ArkaneStudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArkaneStudios/status/1787837804287860886?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Arkane Lyon, which is working on <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/blade-arkane">Marvel's Blade</a>, survives the cull, as does Bethesda Game Studios (Fallout, The Elder Scrolls, Starfield), and Machine Games (<a href="https://www.ign.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</a>). Doom developer id Software is also unaffected.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"This reprioritization of titles and resources means a few teams will be realigned to others and that some of our colleagues will be leaving us.&nbsp;</p></div><p>In an email to staff sent by Matt Booty, head of Xbox Game Studios, Microsoft blamed the cuts on a “reprioritization of titles and resources”. The email, verified by IGN, is below:</p><blockquote>Today I’m sharing changes we are making to our Bethesda and ZeniMax teams. These changes are grounded in prioritizing high-impact titles and further investing in Bethesda’s portfolio of blockbuster games and beloved worlds which you have nurtured over many decades. </blockquote><blockquote>To double down on these franchises and invest to build new ones requires us to look across the business to identify the opportunities that are best positioned for success. This reprioritization of titles and resources means a few teams will be realigned to others and that some of our colleagues will be leaving us.  </blockquote><blockquote>Here are the changes going into effect: </blockquote><blockquote>Arkane Austin – This studio will close with some members of the team joining other studios to work on projects across Bethesda. Arkane Austin has a history of making impactful and innovative games and it is a pedigree that everyone should be proud of. Redfall’s previous update will be its last as we end all development on the game. The game and its servers will remain online for players to enjoy and we will provide make-good offers to players who purchased the Hero DLC. </blockquote><blockquote>Alpha Dog Studios – This studio will also close. We appreciate the team’s creativity in bringing Doom to new players. Mighty Doom will be sunset on August 7 and we will be turning off the ability for players to make any purchases in the game.  </blockquote><blockquote>Tango Gameworks – Tango Gameworks will also close. We are thankful for their contributions to Bethesda and players around the world. Hi-Fi Rush will continue to be available to players on the platforms it is today.  </blockquote><blockquote>Roundhouse Games – The team at Roundhouse Games will be joining ZeniMax Online Studios (ZOS). Roundhouse has played a key role in many of our recent game launches and bringing them into ZOS to work on The Elder Scrolls Online will mean we can do even more to grow the world that millions of players call home.  </blockquote><blockquote>With this consolidation of our Bethesda studio teams, so that we can invest more deeply in our portfolio of games and new IP, a small number of roles across select Bethesda publishing and corporate teams will also be eliminated. </blockquote><blockquote>Those whose roles will be impacted will be notified today, and we ask that you please treat your departing colleagues with respect and compassion. We will provide our full support to those who are impacted in today’s notifications and through their transitions, including severance benefits informed by local laws.  </blockquote><blockquote>These changes are not a reflection of the creativity and skill of the talented individuals at these teams or the risks they took to try new things. I acknowledge that these changes are also disruptive to the various support teams across ZeniMax and Bethesda that bring our games to market. We are making these tough decisions to create capacity to increase investment in other parts of our portfolio and focus on our priority games. </blockquote><blockquote>Bethesda remains one of the key pillars of Xbox with a strong portfolio of amazing games and thriving communities. As we look to the future, there is an impressive line-up of games on the horizon. In 2024 alone we have Starfield Shattered Space, Fallout 76 Skyline Valley, Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, and The Elder Scrolls Online’s Golden Road. As we align our plans and resources to best set ourselves up for success in this complex and changing industry, our teams across Arkane Lyon, Bethesda Game Studios, id Software, MachineGames, ZeniMax Online Studios and the Bethesda publishing and corporate teams will be well-positioned to build new IP, explore new game concepts, and expand on our existing franchises.  </blockquote><blockquote>- Matt</blockquote><p>Microsoft's announcement of the cuts at Bethesda come over three months after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce">the company announced plans to cut 1,900 staff from its video game workforce</a>, and amid a boom time for Bethesda's Fallout series following the breakout hit Prime Video TV show. The closure of Tango Gameworks hits just over a year after the launch of Hi-Fi Rush, what many considered to be <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-review">one of the best Xbox games in recent years</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/aarongreenberg/status/1649431572137779203" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tweeting</a> in April 2023, Aaron Greenberg, VP, Xbox Games Marketing at Microsoft, addressed concern that Hi-Fi Rush had failed to meet sales targets, calling the game "a break out hit for us and our players in all key measurements and expectations." Greenberg continued: "We couldn’t be happier with what the team at Tango Gameworks delivered with this surprise release." <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-hi-fi-rush-confirmed-for-ps5-release-date-announced">Hi-Fi Rush launched on PS5</a> as part of Microsoft's new multi-platform push in March.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/KhhqgR902g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/KhhqgR902g</a></p>— Tango Gameworks (EN) (@TangoGameworks) <a href="https://twitter.com/TangoGameworks/status/1787837929332601189?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/DBakaba/status/1787839169588265251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a series of tweets</a>, Arkane Lyon chief Dinga Bakaba hit out at the cuts, calling them "absolutely terrible." "To any executive reading this, friendly reminder that video games are an entertainment/cultural industry, and your business as a corporation is to take care of your artists/entertainers and help them create value for you," Bakaba continued.</p><p>"Don't throw us into gold fever gambits, don't use us as strawmen for miscalculations/blind spots, don't make our work environments darwinist jungles. You say we make you proud when we make a good game. Make us proud when times are tough. We know you can, we seen it before.</p><p>"For now, great teams are sunsetting before our eyes again, and it's a fucking gut stab. Lyon is safe, but please be tactful and discerning about all this, and respect affected folks' voice and leave it room to be heard, it's their story to tell, their feelings to express.</p><p>"Inside baseball, but if I read 'immersive sim curse' from the community, especially from a fellow dev, I swear to God... Please, let's talk about the *real* challenges instead of rehashing irrational anxieties of the past.</p><p>"Even more inside baseball, but with a very, very wide range, as a wise and sorely missed man said: 'Please Stop.' "</p><p>Layoffs are sweeping the video game industry, with a number of high-profile studios cutting staff or shutting down. In stark contrast to a year of blockbuster video game hits, one of the biggest ongoing industry trends in 2023 was the prevalence of mass layoffs, and they have continued into 2024. While actual figures are difficult to obtain, estimates suggest the number of workers laid off in games last year approached or exceeded 10,000. A recent GDC survey of developers suggests one-third of all game developers were impacted by layoffs last year, either directly or by witnessing them happen at their company.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>There are about a thousand real-estate developers in New York City. Nathan Berman is one of them, and he’s become rich doing it. But, he told me recently, “I never built a building from scratch, and never wanted to.” Instead, Berman, who is sixty-four, specializes in taking existing structures and converting them into apartments, a useful trick in a city that’s always starved for housing—and newly wary of the five-day-a-week office routine. In 2017, he converted 443 Greenwich Street, a former warehouse and book bindery in Tribeca, built in 1883, into a luxury condo; among the celebrities who now own apartments there are <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/notes-on-hollywood/is-harry-styles-a-movie-star">Harry Styles</a> and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/jake-gyllenhaal">Jake Gyllenhaal</a>. (The building was designed to be “paparazzi-proof,” so it features an underground parking area with a valet.) It’s not much of a feat, though, to redo an industrial space that has a rudimentary interior. Berman is more excited by the transformation of huge, obsolete office towers into warrens of one- and two-bedroom apartments. He compares the effort to extract as much residential rental space as possible out of such buildings to solving a Rubik’s Cube.</p><p>Since 1997, Berman, through his firm, Metro Loft Management, has turned eight Manhattan office towers into rental-apartment complexes, adding some five thousand units to the city’s housing stock. His company has just signed a contract for the largest conversion yet in the United States: Pfizer’s former headquarters, on East Forty-second Street, will be refashioned to house about fifteen hundred apartments. Berman has no patience for nostalgia. “You’re tearing down something that simply doesn’t work anymore,” he explained. Although Metro Loft has offices at 40 Wall Street, Berman often works at home himself, on the Upper East Side. He happily spends hours poring over blueprints, dividing former fields of cubicles into small but clever residences and reconceiving onetime copy-machine nooks as mini laundry rooms or skinny kitchens. All his apartments are market-rate properties, so what he creates is élite but ordinary, luxurious but cramped, permanent but marginal. Avinash Malhotra, an architect who has done several conversions with Berman, noted that a single office tower can be carved up into hundreds of little units, as in a hotel. “He is not making housing for the homeless,” Malhotra said. “But I often joke among my employees that what we do is slums for the rich.”</p><p>One day in December, I went to the financial district and joined Berman in the stark white lobby of 55 Broad Street, a thirty-story former office tower that was built in 1967 by Emery Roth &amp; Sons. Berman has started converting it into five hundred and seventy-one apartments, many of them studios aimed at professionals just out of college. Scaffolding surrounded the bottom of the tower, imprisoning a Starbucks by the entrance. Berman dresses to understated effect. He wore a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-and-off-the-avenue/lets-talk-about-the-clothes-on-succession">quiet-luxury</a> ensemble—unzipped Brunello Cucinelli vest, Loro Piana sweater, John Lobb shoes—and carried nothing in his hands but his phone.</p><p>He was overhauling 55 Broad Street under complicated conditions: it still had office tenants inside. The day we visited, five of the floors were still occupied by companies that had not yet left. (One, a property-management outfit called Solstice Residential Group, even sued to stay, but ultimately settled and moved nearby.) Every so often, an office worker rushed through the lobby, looking as lonely as a ghost. The entrance was renovated twenty years ago by the building’s original owners—the Rudin family, a New York real-estate powerhouse—and featured a revolving door, white marble walls, harsh Kubrickian lighting, and a long security credenza. Berman said that he would put in a hinged door, lower the lighting, cover the walls with wood panelling, add a fireplace and an inviting couch or two, and install wide stairs that flowed down to amenity rooms on the floor below. “Walking into the building will seem like walking into a lounge that people are hanging out in,” he told me. “And you just happen to be one of the people that lives here.”</p><p>Among white-collar workers, the <em>covid</em>-19 pandemic led to a profound shift: even when it became safe to return to the office, many employees preferred to <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/can-remote-work-be-fixed">work remotely</a>. Nationwide, offices are only about fifty per cent full. Since 2019, according to a recent academic study, downtown street foot traffic has fallen by an average of twenty-six per cent in America’s fifty-two biggest cities. Urban theorists describe a phenomenon called the “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/23/what-happened-to-san-francisco-really">doom loop</a>”: once workers stop filling up downtown offices, the stores and restaurants that serve them close, which in turn makes the area even emptier. And who wants to work somewhere with no services? In St. Louis, whole swaths of the downtown business district are vacant. Not long ago, the A.T.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;T. Tower, one of the city’s marquee properties, which was sold for two hundred and five million dollars in 2006, was off-loaded for $3.6 million.</p><p>In New York, the rebound has been stronger. On Wall Street, where numerous executives have expressed sharp impatience with remote work—David Solomon, the C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs, has called it an “aberration” that undercuts the company’s “collaborative apprenticeship culture”—foot traffic has returned to eighty per cent of its pre-pandemic level. But on Mondays and Fridays many Manhattan towers become as sparsely populated as an Edward Hopper painting. Some company accountants have started to see the rental of large office spaces—which in New York can cost more than three hundred dollars per square foot—as a colossal waste. In lower Manhattan, major renters such as <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/spotify">Spotify</a> and Meta have begun shrinking their footprints, vacating entire floors that once bustled with employees. For the past three years, about twenty-two per cent of office space in New York has gone unrented—that’s a hundred million vacant square feet, the equivalent of nearly thirty-five Empire State Buildings. For the owners of half-empty towers, it’s become increasingly apparent that a new financial strategy is needed.</p><p>Berman has helped show desperate office-tower owners a way out. Although fewer people may want to work in Manhattan, more than enough still want to live there. The over-all vacancy rate for apartments in the city is now 1.4 per cent—the tightest market in fifty years. The reasons that the city’s work and residential fortunes have not moved in step are various. “There is only one New York,” Berman told me. “Culture, diversity, business, technology, medicine, education—all in one small island.” New York remains a place where many ambitious young people go to start their careers, if not to stay, and this demographic is ideal for the hotel-style conversions for which office towers are most suitable. Moreover, Berman said, “young people are social—they don’t want to sit in the middle of a forest on a Zoom call.”</p><p>Converting offices into apartments won’t be a panacea for New York’s real-estate titans: there is simply too much square footage that is going unused, and this will be a problem as long as companies continue switching to smaller premises. Berman told me, “If we ultimately absorb twenty per cent of the office space, that would be optimistic.” But, he added, conversions will energize neighborhoods that otherwise would be among the worst hit, like the financial district. There, Berman foresees apartments replacing half the empty offices.</p><p>The tower at 55 Broad Street has spent most of its existence as an unlovable building in an unlivable neighborhood. In the Art Deco era, the architectural firm founded by Emery Roth was an innovator—it designed the San Remo and the Beresford apartment buildings, on Central Park West—but by the late nineteen-sixties it was known for maximizing rentable office space above all else. At 55 Broad, which is right around the corner from the Stock Exchange, two adjoining ten-story structures came down to make way for a much taller new building. It was a time of rapid growth on Wall Street—between 1958 and 1973, the amount of office space downtown doubled. The design ethos was “do your own thing.” “This is not the Renaissance, or an age of uniform standards of beautiful buildings,” a member of the City Planning Commission <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/08/archives/innovative-design-and-planning-take-shape-in-lower-manhattan.html">explained to the <em>Times</em></a> in 1973. “No one agrees on anything.”</p><p>The result at 55 Broad was a dark curtain-wall tower with windows and brown panels spaced between thick steel pinstripes. Deep rectangular floors were set back every ten stories, creating a three-tiered wedding cake. Two renovations followed over the decades, but the building remained what it had always been: a dull stack of boxes.</p><p>Shortly after the Rudins built the tower, they attracted as its anchor tenant Goldman Sachs, which was then in a period of wild ascent. Four years after the building opened, a <em>Times</em> reporter dropped by Goldman and excitedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1971/07/11/archives/goldman-sachs-investment-banker-expands-into-new-markets.html">described</a> an “assemblage of young men with longish haircuts and bright colored shirts” on a trading floor that “rips with action.” Goldman was so successful that it eventually built its own building, two blocks south, leaving 55 Broad half empty. In 1985, Drexel Burnham Lambert, the firm that pioneered the junk bond, moved in. Within five years, it had fallen under indictment and gone bankrupt, forcing the Rudins to scramble again. The family spent millions to make 55 Broad into a state-of-the-art tech hub, borrowing strategies from “Being Digital,” by the nineties tech guru Nicholas Negroponte. Broadband was installed on every floor, and for a time the mid-century structure was “one of the most wired in the world,” according to <em>Forbes</em>. This incarnation lasted until the dot-com bust of 2000, when many of 55 Broad’s tenants went under or moved out. In the next decade, terabytes replaced gigabytes, and the number of servers that a cutting-edge tech firm needed could have taken up an entire warehouse. In 2014, plans were leaked for a proposed fifty-three-story replacement at 55 Broad, but it was never built. A lot of time and money is required to safely dismantle a thirty-story tower on a narrow, busy street.</p><p>Six years later, the pandemic hollowed out the city, particularly the business districts. By July, 2023, the Rudins had concluded that 55 Broad—then only sixty per cent rented—had no future as an office tower. They sold most of their interest in the building to Berman, keeping a small part so they could observe how he handled conversions. (Silverstein Properties, which rebuilt the World Trade Center, also became a partner in the project.) The decision to convert to residential was a hard one for the Rudins. “We don’t like selling our buildings,” Bill Rudin, one of the chairs of the family’s company, told me. “That’s kind of a mantra for us.” The opportunity to learn from Berman was a big factor: “We wanted to see the maestro, like a front-row seat to see Leonard Bernstein.”</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a28880&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a28880" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“Let me read to you from a recently fictionalized version of the procedure&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by P. C. Vey</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>The sale price for 55 Broad was $172.5 million. The construction loan was set at two hundred and twenty million dollars. The total cost of the project—nearly four hundred million dollars—was considerable, but replacing the office tower with a new building, Berman told me, would have cost “well over six hundred million.” (Upgrading it in the hope of attracting new office tenants, according to Berman, would have cost roughly eighty million dollars.) And, because of zoning reforms, no new building would be allowed to overwhelm a Manhattan street the way the hulking towers of the postwar period did. A developer who constructed a tower the same height as 55 Broad would likely have to sacrifice twenty per cent of the rentable space.</p><p>Early in the conversion process, Berman’s construction team removed the fluorescent-tube lighting and the dropped PVC ceilings. Then workers knocked down the drywall that had once delineated corner offices, windowless offices, rest rooms, mop closets. “We do a very thorough gut renovation,” Berman told me. “We literally take everything out.” At 55 Broad, the result was nearly four hundred thousand square feet of raw space, with a potential to generate more than thirty million dollars in rental income annually. But Berman still had a major puzzle to solve: If no one wanted to work in a glum, out-of-date building, why would anyone want to live there?</p><p>In the lobby at 55 Broad, Berman pressed the Up button. “This building is <em>way</em> over-elevatored,” he said. Soon, five elevators would be torn out. Apartment buildings, he explained, generally need fewer than half the elevators that office buildings do. “Residents don’t mind waiting twenty seconds more for the elevator,” he said.</p><p>A visit to the sixth floor offered a bleak sight—it was an empty, dark space half the size of a football field, interrupted only by steel support beams and rusted copper waste pipes. The floor was unsealed concrete, and transverse beams along the ceiling were coated with intumescent paint, a fire-resistant covering that looks like bubbling-hot marshmallow. When I stood at the center of the building, the windows were so far away that they looked almost like portholes.</p><p>Berman gave me a detailed tour of the thirteenth floor. In his business, a crucial metric for turning a profit is the time lag between borrowing construction money and renting out units. So he works fast. Just four months had passed since Berman, Silverstein, and Rudin had closed their deal, but the thirteenth floor already felt like part of a new apartment complex. Workers were measuring, drilling, staple-gunning. Metal track had been laid down where new walls would go, and a few drywall panels had already been installed—they were covered in a playful-looking purple glaze, to make them resistant to mold. “It’s a little bit more expensive,” Berman said. “But we don’t want any issues down the road.” On one piece of drywall, “Apt. 10” was scratched in pen. There was even a handsome tub in a bathroom without walls, like a guest who’d arrived too early for a party.</p><p>Renters are now used to the layouts of chain hotels, where there’s one window by the bed, so Berman’s bathrooms and kitchens didn’t need to be sunny, and the kitchens could have a minimal footprint. “Our demographic doesn’t cook,” he said. He referred to the other rooms without windows as “home offices.” Now that working from home was common, I observed, such spaces were likely to get a lot of use. He smiled, then said that many would wind up as bedrooms. This is technically forbidden, because in New York City every bedroom must have a window that can be opened, but it’s a widespread practice nonetheless. Berman laid out a rental scenario: “Imagine two or three Goldman Sachs associates who came to New York just after college and want a little bit more spending money.” (In real-estate ads, a one-bedroom with a windowless office is often called a “convertible two-bedroom.”)</p><p>Berman told me that he could repurpose any office building to residential if the sale price was right. But he acknowledged that 55 Broad posed special challenges. Until the mid-twenty-tens, office-tower conversions in Manhattan mostly involved prewar buildings. These had narrow, smaller floors that divided easily into apartments, and because they were built before air-conditioning they often had courtyards or ventilation shafts. You therefore didn’t have to create odd layouts to give bedrooms some sun. (Natural light tends to peter out about thirty feet into a building’s interior.) Prewar buildings were also full of setbacks, which could become private terraces, and they had oak-panelled elevators that felt homey. I had recently visited the first such building to undergo a major office-to-residence conversion in the financial district, 55 Liberty Street, which long served as the headquarters of Sinclair Oil Corporation. An architect named Joseph Pell Lombardi had converted the building in 1980. I checked out the apartment of one of the first purchasers, on the twenty-third floor. The view was magnificent in three directions, the vista broken only by the gargoyles that the original architect, Henry Ives Cobb, had mounted on the Gothic Revival façade. Looking down from one window, I saw the august Federal Reserve Bank, with its vaults full of gold bars. The view matched the fantasy we all have of living in New York. As the architect Robert&nbsp;A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Stern told the <em>Times</em> in 1996, “Who doesn’t want to live in a skyscraper? Everybody in movies lives in apartments on the top of Manhattan.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>But few towers like 55 Liberty remain available for conversion in the financial district. What are left are postwar structures—many with deep, dark interiors, low ceilings, and scant visual appeal. Berman did what he could to add comfort to such buildings while holding on to his wallet. He could repurpose extra elevator shafts as garbage chutes, for example. In one building, he turned elevator-shaft spaces into foyers for a line of apartments.</p><p>The double-height mechanical floor of 55 Broad, which once contained giant heating and cooling systems, would be turned into two floors of apartments. Residents would be provided with compact <em>HVAC</em> units under certain windows, as in a motel. These units required much less space than the old systems, and were far more energy-efficient. Berman noted that 55 Broad would be the first all-electric, emission-free apartment building in Manhattan. This was not only environmentally beneficial; it also saved him the cost of inserting thousands of feet of piping into concrete floors. It was but one example of how Berman’s monetary interest and the common good conveniently aligned. We looked out a window at an adjacent nondescript office building, and he saw prey. “That’s going to be that way for maybe three to five more years,” he predicted. “That building will be converted, too.”</p><p>Adaptive reuse is a form of recycling, a point that Berman often makes. According to a recent paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research, converting an out-of-date office building into an apartment complex can increase its energy efficiency by as much as eighty per cent. (In a residential building, not everyone blasts the air-conditioning 24/7.) According to <a data-offer-url="https://www.arup.com/news-and-events/study-estimates-carbon-savings-from-office-to-residential-conversion" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.arup.com/news-and-events/study-estimates-carbon-savings-from-office-to-residential-conversion&quot;}" href="https://www.arup.com/news-and-events/study-estimates-carbon-savings-from-office-to-residential-conversion" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a report</a> by the Arup Group, an engineering firm, converting a Manhattan office tower releases, on average, less than half the carbon that building one from scratch does.</p><p>As expensive as these projects may seem, the cheaper cost of repurposing an old building can allow rental prices to be set lower than they would be in a new one. Berman estimated the minimum monthly rent for a studio apartment in a new lower-Manhattan building at well over four thousand dollars, whereas a comparable apartment in 55 Broad will go for about thirty-five hundred. Although this is a considerable sum for one person, it’s not especially expensive by Manhattan standards, and, as Berman acknowledged, many of his units will end up being shared.</p><p>He stressed to me that he is not particularly interested in what goes on inside the apartments, or in what the tenant experience is like. “A renter is <em>not</em> a condominium owner,” he told me several times. He isn’t trying to re-create 443&nbsp;Greenwich Street, his celebrity-friendly condo development, with its wine cellar and tiled hammam. “Our profile is a young person,” he said. “Maybe twenty-four, twenty-five, who stays one or two years, maybe three. They’re not committing.” His clients are in the city-hopping phase of life: “&nbsp;‘O.K., next year, the year is up and I’m going because I need to be in Boston, or I need to be in Chicago, or I’m going to San Francisco.’&nbsp;” Berman had considered improving 55&nbsp;Broad’s dated façade, but decided that it was money poorly spent. “Renters pay less attention to these things,” he said.</p><p>New York renters don’t have much choice, anyway. “We’ve never had this kind of imbalance between demand and supply before,” Berman said, with the pleasure of a person who likes his odds. The vacancy rate in the five or so buildings that he currently owns is about one and a half per cent. He estimated that all the units at 55 Broad would be rented within six months of going on the market.</p><p>A few of Berman’s redevelopment schemes have been more architecturally adventurous. In 2017, he worked with Avinash Malhotra to convert 180 Water Street, also in the financial district. The building, like 55 Broad, was a thick rectangular slab designed by Emery Roth &amp; Sons, and had interior spaces more than seventy feet long. Berman could have rented out these extra-long apartments as they were, but instead he decided to remove the core of the building, where mechanical equipment was taking up space, thereby creating a courtyard and cutting the apartment layouts down to normal length. Though such a restructuring had never been tried before, he took the risk, at a cost of several million dollars. The result gave tenants more light, he said, but that was incidental. New York City law permitted him to add the removed square footage to the top of the building—he gained four floors and a roof with a pool. “If I couldn’t have done that, I wouldn’t have had cost-efficient units,” he said.</p><p>The architects for 55 Broad are John Cetra and his spouse and professional partner, Nancy J. Ruddy. They are well respected in the industry, but they are not starchitects, a type that Berman has no time for. “A young-professional renter isn’t going to pay me more money because my building was designed by Norman Foster,” he told me. One day, Cetra and Ruddy met me at 55 Broad. Cetra described the back-and-forth that he and Berman have on their projects. (55 Broad is their sixth.) Berman sketches out a plan first, then passes it to Cetra. “He wants to make it more efficient,” Cetra said. “I want to make it a little better. ‘Nathan, let’s give this foyer a <em>bit</em> more room.’&nbsp;”</p><p>Whereas Berman focusses on the architect Cass Gilbert’s definition of the skyscraper as a “machine that makes the land pay,” Cetra and Ruddy emphasize pleasure. Cetra showed me his floor plan for 55 Broad: apartments curled around apartments like frolicsome seals. He explained that he and Ruddy always sought the “wow factor,” adding, “Ideally, in as many apartments as you can, when you open the door you see light and you walk toward light.” Shiny wood floors would have heightened this effect, but, Cetra noted a bit sheepishly, the floors at 55 Broad would be covered in something called “vinyl plank flooring.” Wood scuffs too easily in a building where people are constantly moving in and out, and, Cetra said, vinyl flooring was getting better. “They’re able to create patterns that don’t repeat,” he said.</p><p>Ruddy said that it was fun to fit apartment layouts into the constraints set by an office tower’s shape—each unit had “the intricacy of a watch.” She recounted a notable success for which they’d won an award. In 2014, while converting the former Flatotel, on Fifty-second Street, into condos, they had reconfigured an old loading dock—a concrete area where trucks parked and dumpsters were stored—into a new mid-block entrance. “We created this sort of magical lobby out of it,” Ruddy said. “I don’t think anyone had ever converted a loading dock before.”</p><p>Cetra jabbed at his floor plan for 55 Broad to amplify the point: “If this were a new building, every one-bedroom would be exactly the same. But look here. This is a one-bedroom, that’s a studio, that’s a one-bedroom studio, and every one has different proportions.” (A resident of 20 Broad Street, an earlier project that Cetra and Ruddy developed with Berman, complained to Bloomberg News last year about her studio: “It was a very awkward space. It wasn’t square, it wasn’t a rectangle, it had all kinds of bizarre edges and weird corners.”)</p><p>One feature would be standard at 55 Broad: a washer and dryer. “People do their laundry in their pajamas or their underwear while they’re watching television,” Ruddy explained. In the basement, public space that might otherwise be devoted to a large communal laundry room would be aimed at helping tenants meet one another. Small apartments make people want amenities, and amenities make people accept small apartments. The new generation expects post-college life to resemble college. “We’re in an amenities war,” Ruddy said. All the buildings converted in the financial district are full of co-working spaces, gyms, and plush couches.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>One of Cetra and Ruddy’s signature moves, they told me, is to adorn a public space with a modular shelving unit that contains small sculptures and ceramics that “feel like they could have been picked up on a trip overseas.” The architects also include a pile of art books—“Jazzlife,” “Helmut Newton: Work,” a book of Ai Weiwei’s installations. I objected that these seemed like the sorts of books people never actually read, but they disagreed. Tenants did pull them down. In fact, Cetra and Ruddy told me, the books at AVA DoBro, a new apartment building in downtown Brooklyn that they had designed, once disappeared entirely. “It turned out it was a construction worker who had grown up without books,” Ruddy said. “So I replaced them.”</p><p>“They’re good books,” Cetra added.</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27105&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27105" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“For the last time—because it’s relaxing and romantic!”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Sofia Warren</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>We went to 55 Broad’s roof, where we stood in front of a long, empty concrete pit. Ruddy pulled out an iPad to show me a rendering of a future pool: eleven by forty-five feet, set off by a dozen deck chairs facing east and a tasteful border of shrubs to increase, as Ruddy said, “connectivity with nature.” There was what looked to me like a pool house but turned out to be “an indoor-outdoor working space.”</p><p>The 55 Broad tower is four hundred feet tall, but in the financial district that makes it midsize. I pointed out that remnant workers in the neighboring towers could easily peek out their office windows and observe whatever action was ripping on 55 Broad’s rooftop. Cetra said, “That’s part of the fun!”</p><p>In the late seventies, my father and mother, an Upper West Side couple, separated. My father, a corporate lawyer, had long worked at 77 Water Street, a steel-and-glass-curtain edifice, designed by Emery Roth, that still functions as an office building. A few years later, he moved into a nearby one-bedroom apartment, in one of the first converted office towers. It was a prewar building, and the impressive lobby made you feel as though you were heading for an appointment with Mr. Morgan. For my father, the short walk to work, after a professional lifetime of taking the 2 or 3 train up and down Manhattan’s spine, was a pleasure. The apartment had a kitchen he didn’t use, and it was on a high floor. On the nights I stayed with him, we would look out at neighboring towers’ brightly illuminated interiors, the cleaners slowly advancing through each floor, emptying the wastebaskets. He told me that he liked the feeling of being a lumberjack going to sleep in the middle of his forest.</p><p>Back then, there were no restaurants or stores open after business hours, not even a Blimpie. Joseph Pell Lombardi’s son, Michael, who grew up at 55 Liberty Street—the building next to the Federal Reserve—also remembers the streets being empty at night, with guards moving pallets of gold bars. “It all seemed incredibly casual,” Michael remembered. “There was no one around, only me, a kid, imagining how easy it would be just to take one of them.”</p><p>Census figures from 1970 show that just eight hundred and thirty-three people lived south of Chambers Street. By the time I began visiting my father’s place, there were more—but not many. “The jury is still out,” Henry Robbins, an expert on real-estate trends, told the <em>Times</em> in 1996, in an article about living in the financial district. “The area dies at night. It needs a neighborhood, a community.”</p><p>Thanks in part to Berman, the financial district now has enough population density to feel like a proper New York neighborhood. His office at 40 Wall Street is on the seventeenth floor, and he can see five of his converted towers out the window. Within just a few blocks of 55 Broad, he has turned 20 Exchange Place, 63 Wall Street, 67 Wall Street, 180&nbsp;Water Street, and 20 Broad Street into apartment buildings. He is currently working on 25 Water Street, the former headquarters of J. P. Morgan, which, after the Pfizer building, will be the second-largest conversion to date in the United States, with Cetra and Ruddy helping him design thirteen hundred units. <em>Crain’s New York Business</em> has called Berman “the king of FiDi.”</p><p>He enjoys his stature as a local potentate. He began his conversion business in the late nineties, after receiving an eighty-thousand-dollar loan from his father-in-law. For a time, Berman was an outlier as a developer, focussing on a market that others found too small or insufficiently profitable. Now he is turning away projects. David Marks, the executive at Silverstein Properties who is developing 55 Broad Street with Berman, said, “For many years—and I’m quoting Nathan—he was the quirky monster that no one really understood, and now he’s the prettiest girl on the dance floor and everyone wants a dance with him.” Berman can decide almost instantly—just by knowing the age and the location of a building and by glancing at Google Earth—if the place is ripe for conversion. “If the price per pound is right, I say, ‘Let’s go,’&nbsp;” he said.</p><p>Berman, who was born in Ukraine and came to New York at the age of fourteen, is the child of a Holocaust survivor, and the niche he occupies in the city’s real-estate ecology makes sense for an immigrant with a mistrust of government. He focusses only on buildings built before certain years—1977 below Murray Street, and 1961 for the rest of Manhattan—because they can be converted without special variances. (Conversions have long been restricted in Manhattan because sudden population surges in residential neighborhoods can crowd schools and overwhelm public transport.) “Life is short,” he told me. “I don’t want to wait two or three years for rezoning.” A current zoning-change proposal, which Mayor Eric Adams supports, would allow any building in New York built before 1990 to be converted. It would add to the pool of potential apartments nearly as much office space as there is in all of Philadelphia. Berman hopes that the zoning change will become law by the end of the year.</p><p>After we left 55 Broad, Berman took me on a tour of two of his other properties. We started down the street, at 20 Broad, once a part of the Stock Exchange. We briefly visited an apartment, but the showpiece was the sub-lobby level. There was a commercial-size gym replete with punching bags, elliptical trainers, free-weight racks, and rows of treadmills. Another room held pool tables, and a third was a library graced with one of Cetra and Ruddy’s modular shelving units. Nobody seemed older than thirty-five. Down the hall was a vault with heavy iron bars where bonds had once been stored. Rather than pull the huge structure out, Cetra and Ruddy had set up a co-working space in it. (“Tenants sometimes play poker there now.”) As we left, Berman took the massive door and swung it on its massive hinges, eager to show me that it still worked.</p><p>We walked down Beaver and Pearl Streets to 180 Water Street, the building from which Berman had removed the core. At the entrance, he said, “I will challenge you to show me any elements in this interior where you can point out and say, ‘Gee, that’s really from the office period.’&nbsp;” I couldn’t. He boasted that he’d never lost that bet. In the elevator, we met a young resident. She had a dog and said that she had been in the building for more than five years. Berman seemed disappointed.</p><p>On the twelfth floor, near another modular shelving unit, there was a bright-white machine labelled “Tulu: Your Smart Rental Store.” Using your phone, you could rent household items like a toaster or a vacuum cleaner, or buy something you’d run out of: tampons, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/substitutes-for-your-tide-pod-craving">Tide Pods,</a> Doritos. It was a clever way to both justify small closets—“Nathan believes in <em>very</em> compact closets,” Ruddy told me—and monetize how people live now. “These people want to snack at night,” Berman said.</p><p>Afterward, I walked out into the early FiDi night. I turned onto Exchange Place, where I passed crowds of tourists taking pictures of Kristen Visbal’s “Fearless Girl” statue. Various restaurants were filling up, from beer halls like Trinity Place to steak houses like the recently renovated Delmonico’s. Stone Street was now a sort of food court, and I could have picked up groceries at a Whole Foods just north of Exchange Place. (My father would have had to go to the Village to get groceries, if he’d wanted any.) The street life died out at Chambers Street, where government offices stood dark and empty. It was as if the original Dutch settlement had been re-created, back when Wall Street had a wall.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In a 2022 Glassdoor post, a user called McKinsey Consultant asked, “Should I live in FiDi?” The responses included a lot of cheering for the rooftop pools and the great views. But a user called IBM1 advised living somewhere else. “It’s such a soulless neighborhood,” IBM1 wrote. “Don’t be swayed by the ultra luxe buildings.” It’s true that FiDi remains on the sterile side. It could use some parks, and its inhabitants seem either new to the island or temporary. All those amenities in the buildings keep people within their confines; if you have a Tulu dispensing machine in your basement, who needs to drop by a local hardware store or a pharmacy?</p><p>All the same, more than thirty thousand people now live in FiDi—and at least some of them have begun to see it as a permanent home. Berman told me that, whereas more than half of his renters used to be apartment sharers, he expected the percentage at 55 Broad Street to be closer to fifteen. This suggested to him that families were moving in. He added that he recently ripped out a Ping-Pong room at 180 Water and turned it into a children’s play space. “We have sixty children in the building!” he said, amazed. One was his grandson. His son, who is the No. 2 at the firm, and his daughter-in-law moved in five years ago. “They never left,” Berman said.&nbsp;♦</p></div></div>]]></description>

    <p><span><strong>UNSW Sydney engineers have utilised sound waves to cut the time it takes to make a cold brew coffee from many hours down to mere minutes.</strong></span></p>
<p>Fans of cold brew coffee often rave about the smoother, less acidic and less bitter taste compared to a regular hot brew.</p>
<p>There’s just one major problem – it takes anywhere from 12 to 24 hours to fully steep the grounds and allow the flavours to slowly be extracted using only cold water.</p>
<p>That’s far from ideal if you want or need your caffeine fix in a hurry in the morning.</p>
<p>However, engineers from UNSW have now developed a new way to make cold brew coffee in under three minutes – just like a regular hot brew – without sacrificing on the taste experience.</p>
<p>The process involves using an ultrasonic reactor to speed up the brew of the grounded coffee beans, with the research published in <a><i></i></a><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350417724001330" target="_blank" data-click_category="TextComponentRichText" data-click_id="text_Ultrasonics Sonochemistry" data-click_title="RichText" data-click_name="Ultrasonics Sonochemistry">Ultrasonics Sonochemistry</a>.</p>

<p>Addressing the challenge of speeding up the brewing process of a cold brew, the UNSW team led by <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/francisco-trujillo" target="_blank" data-click_category="TextComponentRichText" data-click_id="text_Dr Francisco Trujillo" data-click_title="RichText" data-click_name="Dr Francisco Trujillo">Dr Francisco Trujillo</a>, used an existing model of a Breville espresso machine and superimposed their own patented sound transmission system.</p>
<p>The system connects a bolt-clamped transducer with the brewing basket via a metallic horn – transforming a standard espresso filter basket into a powerful ultrasonic reactor.</p>
<p>The reactor works by injecting sound waves at a frequency of 38.8 kHz at multiple points through its walls – generating multiple regions for acoustic cavitation within the reactor.</p>

    <p>The study also found that this setup can double the extraction yield and caffeine concentration compared to unsonicated samples.</p>
<p>Dr Trujillo, corresponding author of the paper and UNSW food processing engineer in the <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/engineering/our-schools/chemical-engineering" target="_blank" data-click_category="TextComponentRichText" data-click_id="text_School of Chemical Engineering" data-click_title="RichText" data-click_name="School of Chemical Engineering">School of Chemical Engineering</a>, says the ultrasound process speeds up the extraction of the oils, flavours and aroma of the ground coffee.</p>
<p>“Ultrasounds accelerate the extraction process due to acoustic cavitation,” he says.</p>
<p>“When acoustic bubbles collapse near the grounded coffee, they generate micro-jets with enough force to pit and fracture the coffee grounds – intensifying the extraction of the aroma and flavours of the brew.</p>
<p>“And the acceleration is enormous – we are reducing what would typically take 12 to 24 hours to less than three&nbsp; minutes.”</p>

    <p>Dr. Trujillo says the aim was to make the process as easy as making a regular espresso coffee.</p>
<p>“We’re able to demonstrate that this can be adapted to existing espresso machine,” he says.</p>
<p>“We are very excited about developing this technology that can be used by companies that already manufacture coffee machines, so consumers can enjoy an ultrasonic cold brew at home in less than three minutes.</p>
<p>“Very importantly, this breakthrough opens the door for coffee shops and restaurants to produce on-demand brews comparable to 24-hour cold brews, supplying the rising demand while eliminating the need for large semi-industrial brewing units and the associated requirement for extensive refrigeration space.”</p>

    <h2><strong>Same taste in less time</strong><br>
</h2>
<p>Collaborating with researchers from University of Queensland, samples of coffee were sent to the <a href="https://qaafi.uq.edu.au/" target="_blank" data-click_category="TextComponentRichText" data-click_id="text_Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food" data-click_title="RichText" data-click_name="Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food">Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food</a> (QAAFI) where they underwent a thorough sensory analysis.</p>
<p>The samples included cold brew sonicated at room temperature for one minute, the second was sonicated for 3 minutes, and the third was a regular 24 hours stepped brew at four degrees Celsius without sonication.</p>
<p>They were evaluated on their aroma, texture, flavour, and aftertaste attributes.</p>
<p>“Compared to the 24-hour brew, the sonicated one-minute brew sample received similar ratings, especially in flavour, aftertaste attributes including bitterness, sourness, fullness texture and aroma,” says Dr. Trujillo.</p>
<p>“However, it scored lower in aroma intensity and dark chocolate aroma. This suggests that the sonicated 1-minute sample is slightly under-extracted compared to the 24-hour cold brew.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile, the sonicated three-minute sample provided a similar dark chocolate aroma and aroma intensity to the 24-hour cold brew, but slightly more bitter.</p>
<p>“The results of the sensory study showed that a sonication time between one and three minutes is ideal for creating a coffee comparable with 24-hour cold brew coffee, depending on the interest of customers.”</p>
<p>University of Queensland Sensory Scientist and Flavour Chemist <a href="https://qaafi.uq.edu.au/profile/33/heather-smyth" target="_blank" data-click_category="TextComponentRichText" data-click_id="text_Professor Heather Smyth" data-click_title="RichText" data-click_name="Professor Heather Smyth">Professor Heather Smyth</a>, a co-author of the paper, said the new method created a coffee as good as cold brew steeped overnight.</p>
<p>“Our trained sensory panel tastings proved that we can get a very similar taste profile to either a traditional cold brew or an espresso in the time it takes to brew a hot espresso,” Prof. Smyth said.</p>
<p>“Further work could explore different types of beans, different regions of beans and for companies or cafes that specialise in single origin or high-quality beans, this would be another string to the bow to show yet another dimension of coffee.</p>
<p>“Once again, Australia has new technology at our fingertips that moves on from traditional methods to modern methods of coffee making to give consumers a new premium experience.”</p>
<h2><strong>Shaking up the beverage industry</strong></h2>
<p>Ultrasounds can be applied to several areas across the food industry including drying, extraction, emulsification and crystallisation – making the process faster and more efficient.</p>
<p>Dr. Trujillo says this technology can be also used to speed up the brewing process of teas as well.</p>
<p>“With this technology, we’re offering coffee shops, restaurants and even home coffee-brewers the chance to produce on-demand brews, eliminating the need for large brewing and refrigeration units.”</p>

<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/someone-has-finally-beaten-nes-tetris/">we shared the story</a> of how a classic NES <em>Tetris</em> player hit the game's "kill screen" for the first time, activating a crash after an incredible 40-minute, 1,511-line performance. Now, some players are using that kill screen—and some complicated memory manipulation it enables—to code new behaviors into versions of <em>Tetris</em> running on unmodified hardware and cartridges.
</p><p>We've covered similar "arbitrary code execution" glitches in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/01/how-an-emulator-fueled-robot-reprogrammed-super-mario-world-on-the-fly/">games like <em>Super Mario World</em></a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/03/how-to-beat-paper-mario-really-fast-by-playing-ocarina-of-time/"><em>Paper Mario</em></a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/how-to-get-star-fox-64-ships-into-ocarina-of-time-no-hacking-required/"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em></a> in the past. And the basic method for introducing outside code into NES <em>Tetris</em> has been <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/december-update-60288924?l=fr">publicly theorized since at least 2021</a> when players were investigating <a href="https://github.com/CelestialAmber/TetrisNESDisasm">the game's decompiled code</a> (HydrantDude, who has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpEcjdr_YDo">gone deep on <em>Tetris</em> crashes in the past</a>, also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOES2XTqT74&amp;lc=UgwkeKtM7UOPrkYcDnl4AaABAg">says</a> the community has long had a privately known method for how to take full control of <em>Tetris</em>' RAM).
</p><figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QOES2XTqT74?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p>Displaced Gamers explains how to reprogram NES <em>Tetris</em> within the game.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>But <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOES2XTqT74">a recent video from Displaced Gamers</a> takes the idea from private theory to public execution, going into painstaking detail on how to get NES <em>Tetris</em> to start reading the game's high score tables as machine code instructions.</p>
<h2>Fun with controller ports</h2>
<p>Taking over a copy of NES <em>Tetris</em> is possible mostly due to the specific way the game crashes. Without going into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7H_ilLn7nc">too much detail</a>, a crash in NES <em>Tetris</em> happens when the game's score handler takes too long to calculate a new score between frames, which can happen after level 155. When this delay occurs, a portion of the control code gets interrupted by the new frame-writing routine, causing it to jump to an unintended portion of the game's RAM to look for the next instruction.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Usually, this unexpected interrupt leads the code to jump to address the very beginning of RAM, where garbage data gets read as code and often leads to a quick crash. But players can manipulate this jump thanks to a little-known vagary in how <em>Tetris</em> handles potential inputs when running on the Japanese version of the console, the Famicom.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/expansion.jpg" data-height="1440" data-width="1920" alt="The Famicom expansion port that is key to making this hack work."><img alt="The Famicom expansion port that is key to making this hack work." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/expansion-640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/expansion-1280x960.jpg 2x"></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/expansion.jpg" data-height="1440" data-width="1920">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> The Famicom expansion port that is key to making this hack work.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike the American Nintendo Entertainment System, the Japanese Famicom featured two controllers hard-wired to the unit. Players who wanted to use third-party controllers could plug them in through <a href="https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Expansion_port">an expansion port</a> on the front of the system. The <em>Tetris</em> game code reads the inputs from this "extra" controller port, which can include two additional standard NES controllers <a href="https://misteraddons.com/products/nes-controllers-to-famicom-console-adapter">through the use of an adapter</a> (this is true even though the Famicom <a href="https://tetris.wiki/Tetris_(Famicom)">got a completely different version of <em>Tetris</em></a> from Bullet-Proof Software).</p>
<p>As it happens, the area of RAM that <em>Tetris</em> uses to process this extra controller input is also used for the memory location of that jump routine we discussed earlier. Thus, when that jump routine gets interrupted by a crash, that RAM will be holding data representing the buttons being pushed on those controllers. This gives players a potential way to control precisely where the game code goes after the crash is triggered.</p>
<h2>Coding in the high-score table</h2>
<p>For Displaced Gamers' jump-control method, the player has to hold down "up" on the third controller and right, left, and down on the fourth controller (that latter combination requires some controller fiddling to allow for simultaneous left and right directional input). Doing so sends the jump code to an area of RAM that holds the names and scores for the game's high score listing, giving an even larger surface of RAM that can be manipulated directly by the player.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>By putting "(G" in the targeted portion of the B-Type high score table, we can force the game to jump to <em>another</em> area of the high score table, where it will start reading the names and scores sequentially as what Displaced Gamers calls "bare metal" code, with the letters and numbers representing opcodes for the NES CPU.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tetrisscore.png" data-height="700" data-width="884" alt="This very specific name and score combination is actually read as code in Displaced Gamers' proof of concept."><img alt="This very specific name and score combination is actually read as code in Displaced Gamers' proof of concept." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tetrisscore-640x507.png" width="640" height="507" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tetrisscore.png 2x"></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tetrisscore.png" data-height="700" data-width="884">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> This very specific name and score combination is actually read as code in Displaced Gamers' proof of concept.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, there are only 43 possible symbols that can be used in the name entry area and 10 different digits that can be part of a high score. That means only a small portion of <a href="https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/CPU_unofficial_opcodes">the NES's available opcode instructions</a> can be "coded" into the high score table using the available attack surface.</p>
<p>Despite these restrictions, Displaced Gamers was able to code a short proof-of-concept code snippet that can be translated into high-score table data <code>(A name of '))"-P)'</code>, and a second-place score of 8,575 in the A-Type game factors prominently, in case you're wondering). This simple routine puts two zeroes in the top digits of the game's score, lowering the score processing time that would otherwise cause a crash (though the score will eventually reach the "danger zone" for a crash again, with continued play).</p>
<p>Of course, the lack of a battery-backed save system means hackers need to achieve these high scores manually (and enter these complicated names) every time they power up <em>Tetris</em> on a stock NES. The limited space in the high score table also doesn't leave much room for direct coding of complex programs on top of <em>Tetris</em>' actual code. But there are ways around this limitation; HydrantDude <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOES2XTqT74&amp;lc=UgwkeKtM7UOPrkYcDnl4AaABAg">writes</a> of a specific set of high-score names and numbers that "build[s] another bootstrapper which builds another bootstrapper that grants full control over all of RAM."</p>
<p>With that kind of full control, a top-level player could theoretically recode NES <em>Tetris</em> to patch out the crash bugs altogether. That could be extremely helpful for players who are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPyf5kIGoKA">struggling to make it past level 255</a>, where the game actually loops back to the tranquility of Level 0. In the meantime, I guess you could always just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hB6eY73sLV0">follow the lead of <em>Super Mario World</em> speedrunners</a> and transform <em>Tetris</em> into <em>Flappy Bird</em>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

<p><em>pyspread</em> is a non-traditional spreadsheet application that is based on and written in the programming language Python.
The goal of <em>pyspread</em> is to be the most pythonic spreadsheet.</p>

<p><em>pyspread</em> expects Python expressions in its grid cells, which makes a spreadsheet specific language obsolete. Each cell returns a
Python object that can be accessed from other cells. These objects can represent anything including lists or matrices.</p>

<p><em>pyspread</em> is free software. It is released under the GPL v3 licence.</p>

<p>The latest release is <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyspread/" target="blank">pyspread v2.2.3</a> (<a href="https://gitlab.com/pyspread/pyspread" target="blank">source code</a>). It requires Python 3.6+.</p>

<p>The last (outdated) release that is compatible with Python 2.x is pyspread v1.1.3.</p>

<p><img src="https://pyspread.gitlab.io/images/screenshot_sinus_large.png" alt="Pyspread example"></p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Cells accept Python code and return Python objects</li>
  <li>Access to Python modules from within cells including e.g. <a href="https://numpy.org/" target="blank">NumPy</a></li>
  <li>Imports CSV, SVG</li>
  <li>Exports CSV, SVG, PDF*</li>
  <li>Cells may display text, markup, images, dates** or charts**</li>

  <li>Spell checker**</li>
  <li>git-able pysu save file format</li>
  <li>blake2b based save file signatures that prevent foreign code execution</li>
</ul>

<p>Notes: * PDF export via print to file, ** requires optional dependencies</p>

<h2 id="target-user-group">Target User Group</h2>

<p>Directly using Python code in a grid is a core feature of <em>pyspread</em>. The target user group has
experience with or wants to learn the programming language Python:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Clara is a research engineer. She systematically compares results of different parameter sets.
She is proficient with Python and has used it for her scientific analyses. Clara wants a quick initial overview
of how changing specific parameters affects her results. With <em>pyspread</em>, Clara is displaying each result in one cell.
This allows her to quickly figure out, which parameters she is going to focus on next.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Peter is using spreadsheets to prepare business decisions. 
He separates data from code by keeping his business data in CSV files and accessing these files from <em>pyspread</em>. 
Furthermore, Peter is worried about algorithmic errors and calculation inaccuracies is his complicated tables. 
He is importing the <em>Money</em> datatype from <a href="https://github.com/py-moneyed/py-moneyed" target="blank">py-moneyed</a>
in the Macro panel. The dedicated Money class helps him avoiding floating point errors. 
Peter has implemented his analysis tools together with unit tests in a separate Python module, 
which he is importing as well. Therefore, he is worrying less about wrong results 
that may lead to bad business decisions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Not part of the target user group are Donna and Jack:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Donna is looking for a free replacement for Ms. Excel. She does not know any programming language, and she has no time to learn Python.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Jack does computation intensive data analysis. He is looking for a spreadsheet that can parallelize calculations - ideally out of the box as a cluster or a cloud solution.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This does not mean that Donna or Jack cannot work with <em>pyspread</em>. However, Donna might find the learning
curve for using Python code in cells too steep. Jack on the other hand might be disappointed because he has to 
ensure manually that his long running tasks are not locking up pyspread.</p>

<p>Researchers have devised an attack against nearly all virtual private network applications that forces them to send and receive some or all traffic outside of the encrypted tunnel designed to protect it from snooping or tampering.</p>
<p>TunnelVision, as the researchers have named their attack, largely negates the entire purpose and selling point of VPNs, which is to encapsulate incoming and outgoing Internet traffic in an encrypted tunnel and to cloak the user’s IP address. The researchers believe it affects all VPN applications when they’re connected to a hostile network and that there are no ways to prevent such attacks except when the user's VPN runs on Linux or Android. They also said their attack technique may have been possible since 2002 and may already have been discovered and used in the wild since then.</p>
<h2>Reading, dropping, or modifying VPN traffic</h2>
<p>The effect of TunnelVision is “the victim's traffic is now decloaked and being routed through the attacker directly,” a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajsLmZia6UU">video demonstration</a> explained. “The attacker can read, drop or modify the leaked traffic and the victim maintains their connection to both the VPN and the Internet.”</p>
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ajsLmZia6UU?si=kroidLuk1JIYZpl_?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p>TunnelVision - CVE-2024-3661 - Decloaking Full and Split Tunnel VPNs - Leviathan Security Group.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>The attack works by manipulating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol">DHCP server</a> that allocates IP addresses to devices trying to connect to the local network. A setting known as <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3442">option 121</a>&nbsp;allows the DHCP server to override default routing rules that send VPN traffic through a local IP address that initiates the encrypted tunnel. By using option 121 to route VPN traffic through the DHCP server, the attack diverts the data to the DHCP server itself. Researchers from Leviathan Security explained:</p>                                            
                                                        
<blockquote><p>Our technique is to run a DHCP server on the same network as a targeted VPN user and to also set our DHCP configuration to use itself as a gateway. When the traffic hits our gateway, we use traffic forwarding rules on the DHCP server to pass traffic through to a legitimate gateway while we snoop on it.</p>
<p>We use DHCP option 121 to set a route on the VPN user’s routing table. The route we set is arbitrary and we can also set multiple routes if needed. By pushing routes that are more specific than a /0 CIDR range that most VPNs use, we can make routing rules that have a higher priority than the routes for the virtual interface the VPN creates. We can set multiple /1 routes to recreate the 0.0.0.0/0 all traffic rule set by most VPNs.</p>
<p>Pushing a route also means that the network traffic will be sent over the same interface as the DHCP server instead of the virtual network interface. This is intended functionality that isn’t clearly stated in the RFC. Therefore, for the routes we push, it is never encrypted by the VPN’s virtual interface but instead transmitted by the network interface that is talking to the DHCP server. As an attacker, we can select which IP addresses go over the tunnel and which addresses go over the network interface talking to our DHCP server.</p>

<p>We now have traffic being transmitted outside the VPN’s encrypted tunnel. This technique can also be used against an already established VPN connection once the VPN user’s host needs to renew a lease from our DHCP server. We can artificially create that scenario by setting a short lease time in the DHCP lease, so the user updates their routing table more frequently. In addition, the VPN control channel is still intact because it already uses the physical interface for its communication. In our testing, the VPN always continued to report as connected, and the kill switch was never engaged to drop our VPN connection.</p></blockquote>
<p>The attack can most effectively be carried out by a person who has administrative control over the network the target is connecting to. In that scenario, the attacker configures the DHCP server to use option 121. It’s also possible for people who can connect to the network as an unprivileged user to perform the attack by setting up their own rogue DHCP server.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The attack allows some or all traffic to be routed through the unencrypted tunnel. In either case, the VPN application will report that all data is being sent through the protected connection. Any traffic that’s diverted away from this tunnel will not be encrypted by the VPN and the Internet IP address viewable by the remote user will belong to the network the VPN user is connected to, rather than one designated by the VPN app.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Android is the only operating system that fully immunizes VPN apps from the attack because it doesn't implement option 121. For all other OSes, there are no complete fixes. When apps run on Linux there’s a setting that minimizes the effects, but even then TunnelVision can be used to exploit a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack">side channel</a> that can be used to de-anonymize destination traffic and perform targeted denial-of-service attacks. Network firewalls can also be configured to deny inbound and outbound traffic to and from the physical interface. This remedy is problematic for two reasons: (1) a VPN user connecting to an untrusted network has no ability to control the firewall and (2) it opens the same side channel present with the Linux mitigation.</p>
<p>The most effective fixes are to run the VPN inside of a virtual machine whose network adapter isn’t in bridged mode or to connect the VPN to the Internet through the Wi-Fi network of a cellular device. The research, from Leviathan Security researchers Lizzie Moratti and Dani Cronce, is available <a href="https://www.leviathansecurity.com/blog/tunnelvision">here</a>.</p>

<p>Google is killing off the Google Fit APIs. The platform originally existed to sync health data from third-party fitness devices to your Google account, but now it's <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/05/evolving-health-on-android-migrating-from-google-fit-apis-to-android-health.html">being killed off</a>. Deprecation of the APIs happened on May 1, and Google has stopped accepting new sign-ups for the API. The official shutdown date is June 30, 2025.</p>
<p>The Google Fit API was launched <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/06/google-previews-google-fit-apis-for-sharing-fitness-logging-info/">in 2014</a>, just a few weeks after Apple announced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/06/apple-announces-ios-8-at-wwdc/">Healthkit</a> in iOS 8. The goal of both platforms is to be a central repository for health data from various apps and services. Instead of seeing steps in one app and weight in another, it could all be mushed together into a one-stop-shop for health metrics. Google had a lot of big-name partners at launch, like Nike+, Adidas, Withings, Asus, HTC, Intel, LG, and app makers like Runtastic and RunKeeper.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to 2024, and we get the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/a-decade-and-a-half-of-instability-the-history-of-google-messaging-apps/">familiar story</a> of Google being unable to throw its weight behind a single solution. Today, Google has <em>three</em> competing fitness APIs. There is a "<a href="https://developer.android.com/health-and-fitness/guides/health-connect/migrate/comparison-guide">Comparison Guide</a>" on the Android Developer site detailing the differences between the "Health Connect" API, the "Fitbit Web API" and the "Google Fit REST API."</p>
<p>Besides killing off the API, Google Fit in general seems like a dead product. Google's deal to acquire Fitbit <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/01/google-closes-the-fitbit-acquisition-pledges-to-not-use-data-for-ads/">closed in 2021</a>, making Fitbit the shiny new fitness brand and bringing with it fitness API No. 2. New Google products like the Pixel Watch and Pixel phones come with the Fitbit app as the built-in fitness solution instead of Google Fit, and the Google Fit app hasn't seen a significant upgrade in a while.</p>
<figure><img alt="Google's Fit API shutdown timeline. " src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/fit-timeline.png" width="960" height="192"><figcaption><p>Google's Fit API shutdown timeline. </p><p>Google</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google's new fitness API, Health Connect, has had a "beta" app on the Play Store since 2022 that only works with Android 13, and in Android 14, Health Connect became baked into the OS as an open source framework for storing health data. That Android 14 launch was only seven months ago, and with Android's slow update schedule and even slower developer feature adoption, it's hard to say too much about Health Connect. Google notes that the Play Store version of Health Connect and the Android 14 version of Health Connect are not the same thing (!), and an automatic <a href="https://developer.android.com/health-and-fitness/guides/health-connect/migrate/migrate-from-android-13-to-14">"migration" pop-up screen</a> and <em>device reboot</em> is needed to move to the Android 14 version. Google hasn't said anything about compatibility with versions of Android older than Android 14 (or 13?), so even in 2025, Android's slow update speed means this is going to be an API with low device support.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>One change pointed out by Google's comparison guide is that while the Fitbit API syncs health data to your Fitbit account (Fitbit accounts are also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/google-will-start-assimilating-fitbit-accounts-next-year/">being shut down</a> in 2025), and the Google Fit API syncs health data to your Google account, Health Connect doesn't sync to any cloud provider. The documentation around Health Connect never talks about the cloud at all. From a platform perspective, not having cloud sync makes Health Connect more of a neutral, not-Google-affiliated standard for health data storage. Google also pitches the lack of cloud storage as a privacy feature. And just like how Google and Samsung <a href="https://youtu.be/d14GVcnbTeo?t=263">teamed up</a> for Wear OS (I assume this was a related project) Samsung has agreed to give up on the "<a href="https://developer.android.com/health-and-fitness/guides/health-services/health-platform">Health Platform API</a>" and is a <a href="https://developer.samsung.com/health/health-connect-faq.html">launch partner</a> for Health Connect.</p>
<p>From a user perspective, with no cloud syncing, what happens to my health data if I switch devices or if my phone breaks? Can I ever easily look at my health data in a more capable tablet or web app, or will that not work? For now, all talk of "sharing" is limited to local apps or devices that directly sync to your phone, like a smartwatch. The Fitbit app can show third-party <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/new-android-features-february-2024/">Health Connect</a> data right now, but it's unclear if it will sync third-party data to the cloud. Google notes that "Our Android Health API offerings have moved to an on-device model, so there will not be an alternative to the Fit REST API." (A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST">REST API</a>, by definition, is over the Internet.)</p>
<p>The company's <a href="https://developer.android.com/health-and-fitness/guides/health-connect/migrate/migration-guide">migration guide</a> notes that the Google Fit and Health Connect APIs aren't compatible, and for now Google recommends supporting both while users and manufacturers transition from one API to the other. The guide also flatly says, "We don't recommend migrating to Health Connect if you're an existing Google Fitbit Web API developer," and then offers no alternative, so it sounds like the goal is siloed on-device data only, and any devices that use the web APIs will stop syncing in 2025.</p>
<p>By the way, despite being the same age, Apple's Healthkit ecosystem<em> isn't</em> being shut down and will continue running. While Google starts over, Healthkit will continue growing its ecosystem and its already significant lead, and Apple will continue to build user and developer trust.</p>
