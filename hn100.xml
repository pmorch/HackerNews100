<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
				
				
				
				<p>It’s a grim week for Meta. The company formerly known as Facebook, and before that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Facebook" target="_blank">Facemash</a>, “designed to evaluate the attractiveness of female Harvard students,” now encompasses Facebook, Instagram, Threads, WhatsApp, and Meta, the failed vision for a remote workplace, fun-zone, and Zucker-verse where <a href="https://x.com/MetaHorizon/status/1579947568372404226" target="_blank">legs are always just around the corner.</a></p>
<p>CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg announced that <a href="https://theintercept.com/2025/01/09/facebook-instagram-meta-hate-speech-content-moderation/" target="_blank">slurs are okay</a> on their platforms, added <a href="https://apnews.com/article/meta-facebook-zuckerberg-board-members-dana-white-199436c62c934ebb751b564f874ad2f6" target="_blank">a pro-Trump UFC boss to their board</a>, and made <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/10/mark-zuckerberg-joe-rogan-facebook-censorship-biden" target="_blank">appearances in the aggrieved weirdo media world</a> to make some convoluted case that we need more masculine energy in business, more resentment overall, and more fealty to Don Trump. Zuckerberg has also recently switched up his personal style so that he now looks like he’s perpetually in a sitcom flashback where an older actor is unconvincingly costumed to look like their younger self.</p>
<p>And in the Northern District of California,&nbsp;<em>Wired&nbsp;</em>reports, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/new-documents-unredacted-meta-copyright-ai-lawsuit/" target="_blank">recently unredacted court documents reveal</a> that Meta used a database of pirated books to train its AI systems<i>. </i>These documents were unsealed as part of a copyright lawsuit, one of the earliest of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-copyright-case-tracker/" target="_blank">many similar cases</a>, called <i>Kadrey et al. v. Meta Platforms.</i> The plaintiffs in this case are a number of writers and performers, including Richard Kadrey, Christopher Golden, Junot Diaz, Laura Lippman, Sarah Silverman, Ta-Nehisi Coates, and—jump scare!—Mike Huckabee.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/new-documents-unredacted-meta-copyright-ai-lawsuit/" target="_blank">new documents quote</a> Meta employees frankly admitting to using stolen stuff from a notorious piracy site:</p>
<p>…an internal quote from a Meta employee, included in the documents, in which they speculated, “If there is media coverage suggesting we have used a dataset we know to be pirated, such as LibGen, this may undermine our negotiating position with regulators on these issues.”…</p>
<p>…These newly unredacted documents reveal exchanges between Meta employees unearthed in the discovery process, like a Meta engineer telling a colleague that they hesitated to access LibGen data because “torrenting from a [meta-owned] corporate laptop doesn’t feel right 😃”. They also allege that internal discussions about using LibGen data were escalated to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg (referred to as “MZ” in the memo handed over during discovery) and that Meta’s AI team was “approved to use” the pirated material.</p>
<p>Meta has claimed that they used publicly available material that was legally accessible under fair use doctrine, but that doesn’t pass the smell test to me: just because something is public on the internet, doesn’t make it legal.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs are arguing that they should be allowed to expand their case <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/new-documents-unredacted-meta-copyright-ai-lawsuit/" target="_blank">to incorporate these new findings</a>:</p>
<p>“Meta, through a corporate representative who testified on November 20, 2024, has now admitted under oath to uploading (aka ‘seeding’) pirated files containing Plaintiffs’ works on ‘torrent’ sites,” the motion alleges. (Seeding is when torrented files are then shared with other peers after they have finished downloading.)</p>
<p>“This torrenting activity turned Meta itself into a distributor of the very same pirated copyrighted material that it was also downloading for use in its commercially available AI models.”</p>
<p>Legally, Meta and their lawyers may find a way to finagle the law and get around this. But in plain terms, it doesn’t seem defensible for a major company with tons of lawyers, money, and talent to knowingly use stolen work to build something that they then turn around and sell.</p>
<p>I’m not naive enough to think that this lawsuit, or any of the many others currently winding their way through the courts, will end in this kind of software leaving the market—in America, you can’t unring a bell that’s been valued in the billions. But I do hope that the writers and artists whose work was stolen are compensated.</p>
<p>In spite of all this, tech-optimists continue to push AI in more places, and people in power continue to trumpet it as the future of everything. In the case of publishing, for example, the excellent <a href="https://www.instagram.com/xoxopublishinggg/#" target="_blank">xoxopublishinggg</a> Instagram account has been posting anonymous responses about publishing workers’ experiences with AI in the workplace—it seems like a lot of publishers are at least curious about these tools in ways that don’t bode well for an AI-less future.</p>
<p>If you’re considering using AI, or are feeling pressure at work to do so, you can add “built on piracy” to the list of concerns about this tech, alongside its environmental impact, its human toll on underpaid and marginalized workers, and the simple fact that it is incapable of making anything good.</p>

<p dir="auto">Ruff is so fast that sometimes I add an intentional bug in the code just to confirm it's actually
running and checking the code.</p>

co-creator of <a href="https://graphql.org/" rel="nofollow">GraphQL</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Why is Ruff a gamechanger? Primarily because it is nearly 1000x faster. Literally. Not a typo. On
our largest module (dagster itself, 250k LOC) pylint takes about 2.5 minutes, parallelized across 4
cores on my M1. Running ruff against our <em>entire</em> codebase takes .4 seconds.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Ruff is ~150-200x faster than flake8 on my machine, scanning the whole repo takes ~0.2s instead of
~20s. This is an enormous quality of life improvement for local dev. It's fast enough that I added
it as an actual commit hook, which is terrific.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Ruff supports over 800 lint rules</strong>, many of which are inspired by popular tools like Flake8,
isort, pyupgrade, and others. Regardless of the rule's origin, Ruff re-implements every rule in
Rust as a first-party feature.</p>
<p dir="auto">By default, Ruff enables Flake8's <code>F</code> rules, along with a subset of the <code>E</code> rules, omitting any
stylistic rules that overlap with the use of a formatter, like <code>ruff format</code> or
<a href="https://github.com/psf/black">Black</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you're just getting started with Ruff, <strong>the default rule set is a great place to start</strong>: it
catches a wide variety of common errors (like unused imports) with zero configuration.</p>

<p dir="auto">Beyond the defaults, Ruff re-implements some of the most popular Flake8 plugins and related code
quality tools, including:</p>

<p dir="auto">Ruff's linter draws on both the APIs and implementation details of many other
tools in the Python ecosystem, especially <a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8">Flake8</a>, <a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes">Pyflakes</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle">pycodestyle</a>, <a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle">pydocstyle</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade">pyupgrade</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/PyCQA/isort">isort</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">In some cases, Ruff includes a "direct" Rust port of the corresponding tool.
We're grateful to the maintainers of these tools for their work, and for all
the value they've provided to the Python community.</p>
<p dir="auto">Ruff's formatter is built on a fork of Rome's <a href="https://github.com/rome/tools/tree/main/crates/rome_formatter"><code>rome_formatter</code></a>,
and again draws on both API and implementation details from <a href="https://github.com/rome/tools">Rome</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/prettier/prettier">Prettier</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/psf/black">Black</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Ruff's import resolver is based on the import resolution algorithm from <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/pyright">Pyright</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Ruff is also influenced by a number of tools outside the Python ecosystem, like
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy">Clippy</a> and <a href="https://github.com/eslint/eslint">ESLint</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Ruff is the beneficiary of a large number of <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/graphs/contributors">contributors</a>.</p>

        <p dir="auto">This is not a "device" support wish, but a "platform" one. Stable Diffusion on native Windows with AMD GPUs is not possible until we get "Windows" support for "AI Libraries" (specifically MIOpen) here: <a href="https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-windows/en/develop/reference/component-support.html" rel="nofollow">https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-windows/en/develop/reference/component-support.html</a></p>
<p dir="auto">This is required to get PyTorch working. I've seen so many AMD users in recent times selling their AMD GPUs and buying "the competition" because WSL and ZLUDA are their only options, and those are half-baked solutions. Native Windows support should be a top priority.</p>

<p dir="auto">Still holding on to the precompiled wheel for torch 1.13 ROCM 5.2 for Python 3.10 which is the last one that works (after setting HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION). Later versions seem to either outright crash, or import correctly but then crash when a tensor is sent to the GPU.</p>

        <p dir="auto">Considering my GPU( 6600 XT)  was released near the end of 2021 it would be nice to know that I don't need to buy a new GPU every year just to have support. It would also be nice to have actual proper Windows support instead of having to deal with the clusterfuck that is Zluda, or other translation layers. This kind of treatment from AMD is why I'll probably go nvidia the next time my budget allows it.</p>

        <p dir="auto">APU support opens the door for introducing this software to a wide audience, please consider hitting the entire APU line (3 and 3.5.) Early ROCm worked for 780m and got me in the front door of working with this software at all (that said I had to use env var hacks to get it functioning). Later versions of ROCm stopped working at all.</p>
<p dir="auto">The hobbyist crowd would greatly benefit from APU support, which hopefully has the AMD financial incentive of market share and product familiarity (hobbyist engineers who do something neat at home and then bring the concepts to work, where you then pick up the larger purchases)</p>
<p dir="auto">If I was able to feel confident in better consumer ROCm support I would have gladly dropped money for 2 AMD graphics cards for the LLM stuff I do.</p>

IMO all products going forward should be able to run all typical ML software: stable diffusion, LLMs, pytorch.<br>
Doesn't have to be crazy fast, but support it and then improve it over time.<br>
And simultaneously, but fine if at a lower pace, walk backwards and support the older products.</p>
<p dir="auto">So you should start by supporting strix halo and RDNA 4. Then RDNA 3 and prior APUs.</p>

        <p dir="auto">Thank you for reaching out and at least trying to extend the device support. The limited consumer hardware support has always been one of the weakest point of ROCm, and if AMD is serious about the future of ROCm, at least any upcoming hardware should be supported. Being able to get used to a platform without spending 1000s is actually huge.<br>
Currently, even if unsupported, many actually work fine. I did and I'm still doing some PyTorch stuff on a 8700GE, which has a gfx1103 GPU in it. Works, but there are some nasty minor issues like this one here, causing the GPU driver to crash now and then, seemingly a firmware issue: <a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="2474223008" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/lamikr/rocm_sdk_builder/issues/141" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/lamikr/rocm_sdk_builder/issues/141/hovercard" href="https://github.com/lamikr/rocm_sdk_builder/issues/141">lamikr/rocm_sdk_builder#141</a><br>
I think, it's a rather small step for AMD to make those 99% working devices to a 100% officially supported level.</p>

<p dir="auto">If you time this right and build high VRAM consumer cards with broad software support, the next generation of media production could ride on your platform.</p>
<p dir="auto">Let me underscore: you <em>must</em> be able to run popular image and video models.</p>

        <p dir="auto">Basically, anything with more than 16GB of RAM. APUs capable of using system RAM could be a cost-effective entry-level option for running large language models (LLMs). While they might be slower, many people don’t require real-time LLM output.</p>
<p dir="auto">Everyone wants to run large models, but not everyone can afford to spend several thousand dollars on professional GPUs, multiple high-end prosumer cards, or Macs.</p>
<p dir="auto">The ROCm user base could grow rapidly if people could leverage their existing iGPUs for AI tasks. I wish my Raven Ridge APU could handle slow AI tasks, like sorting and tagging photos on my Nextcloud NAS, and similar applications.</p>

        <p dir="auto">It's important to note that "Support" means wildly different things to different people.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The compiler knows how to emit code for the GPU</li>
<li>The driver knows how to load code onto / allocate memory etc for the GPU</li>
<li>The libraries have been compiled for that GPU (so can actually run)</li>
<li>The libraries have GPU-specific optimisations implemented (i.e. are faster)</li>
<li>The ROCm release process tests / validates on that GPU</li>
<li>The various CI systems run on that GPU</li>
<li>Variations on where tickets can be raised</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">I believe this is where things have gone south. The ROCm release testing / validation is thorough and somewhat linear in the number of GPUs tested on so adding more hardware to that set costs lots of time. The cards behave fairly similarly to one another so it's also not especially informative. However writing "Supported: Foo" without actually putting Foo through the same internal testing as all others seems problematic.</p>
<p dir="auto">What a decent fraction of people want is for ROCm to run on their gaming card(s). Whether it actually went through the internal validation is somewhat less important than it refusing to run entirely because the libraries haven't been compiled for their hardware.</p>
<p dir="auto">I think the solution to this is really obvious. Build the userspace software for all the targets. Let "Supported" continue to mean whatever it currently does. That'll mean people can install the ROCm distribution and get something which at least attempts to run on their hardware. Optionally introduce a new term, whatever marketing like, to refer to the hardware that isn't on the supported list.</p>
<p dir="auto">I personally don't care at all whether the latest ROCm release has been carefully tested on the graphics card I'm using locally but I'm really annoyed when it wasn't compiled for it.</p>

        <p dir="auto">I would like to see full-stack generational support on Linux with both the runtime and HIP SDK for consumer cards on RDNA[1|2|3] and then extending it to GCN where possible.</p>
<p dir="auto">At the moment AMD have structured [and in my opinion artificially limited] their compatibility matrices to the upper tiers of the hardware stacks, e.g. 6800 and up on RDNA2, preventing those who own 6750XT and lower stack cards from using ROCm/HIP.</p>
<p dir="auto">I understand that a lot of the unsupported hardware "just works" in some fashion but it is not officially supported nor documented as being supported or which components/libraries work and which do not - this is just bad all around as nobody will buy GPU hardware or buy into the ROCm software ecosystem without knowing before hand that the hardware is capable, the hardware feature set is fully supported in software and it is relatively easy to get up and running as an end user, this is especially bad from a PR perspective for AMD in wanting to get more people to use their hardware when it is restricted by hardware/pricing tiers and by the AMD software itself.</p>
<p dir="auto">Nobody is going to purchase a GPU in order to dip into trying out the ROCm ecosystem if they have to purchase the highest tiers of GPU to know for sure that ROCm will fully support the hardware.</p>
<p dir="auto">Artificial limits which segregate capable hardware through a lack of support in or a lack of enablement in software is not a good practice and it harms not only end-users/customers but AMD and ROCm adoption too.</p>
<p dir="auto">I would like to see AMD's stance on this change to one of starting from full enablement from the outset where the hardware features exist to do that and remove any artificial tiering/segregation entirely, tear down those walls.</p>

        <p dir="auto">You know, the reason AMD is way behind Nvidia in market share is because Nvidia literally supports every single discrete graphics processor model with CUDA from the low end to their high end.  They realized what AMD never has, and has continuously annoyed people, especially Linux users.  Not everyone writing software for CUDA has an ultra high end GPU product <em>because they can't afford them</em>.  But they have a very robust software development community where the underlying SDKs largely just works.  Intel has effectively realized the same thing with ARC.</p>
<p dir="auto">If AMD can't at least match the Linux support matrix with the Windows support matrix going forward you're rapidly going to grow completely irrelevant with new generations of software tinkerers who are primarily writing software on Linux. Windows from a compute performance point of view is demonstrably poor in comparison, and the user experience is degrading over time as Microsoft lets their OS foundation crumble while they're off chasing unicorns.</p>
<p dir="auto">What's my vote?  Every GPU currently under active driver support including Vega. Vega still has a fairly large-ish install base.  Arbitrary decisions to drop support may make business decisions, but it annoys customers who buy hardware only to have it dropped from support not long after it was still being sold.  But if you must narrow down your support matrix everything from the RX 5000 series and newer.  Either actually compete with the CUDA hardware support experience or get out of the game.  Those are your only options because that's the market you're trying to grow and Nvidia is the dominant player.</p>

        <p dir="auto">I'm not sure why, but for me it seems that for example RDNA2 cards (and APUs) are not unsupported, but rather blocked. With setting <code>HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=10.3.0</code> ROCm (using pytorch) runs fine. Since Linux 6.10 and the APU memory fix it even works on my Ryzen 6000 notebook. Why the need for that environment variable?</p>
<p dir="auto">If you don't have the resources to run all tests on all types of consumer GPU/APU and you want to ensure that you provide a build that is fully tested: Why not an "enterprise release" that is fully tested and has only support for tested card and a "community edition" that has all GPUs enabled but is not fully tested (both build from the same source code with the same versions, only difference is the activated cards).</p>
<p dir="auto">If you're thinking supporting a lot of consumer GPUs is a waste of money: A big reason why NVIDIA is so successful in the AI market, because every student with even the smallest NVIDIA GPU was able to experiment with CUDA on her/his own machine. Years later when those students are working in the industry, with what products/APIs do they have experience? And when they make decisions, what will they buy for their company?<br>
AMD missed the first big wave, so they need to catch up, and maybe they get a second chance to really gain market share at some point (when for example NVIDIA is having issues with a new generation).</p>

        <p dir="auto">This is fundamentally misguided. It's not a question of which specific GPUs are supported now. It's a question of:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Will support consistently be added for new GPUs at the time of launch? Your competition has day 1 support for new GPUs, and doesn't arbitrarily decide that half the GPUs in a new generation will be incompatible.</li>
<li>Will support consistently be kept for GPUs that are currently supported? You competition still runs on ancient laptops out-of-the-box.</li>
<li>Do consumers trust you to keep to your word for 1 &amp; 2? You've walked back support before.</li>

        <p dir="auto">Supporting gfx1036 is a must. It's probably the most available device and would allow many people to see if something is working on ROCm at all. It's also a great option to test on RDNA2 when you have other generation dGPUs.</p>
<p dir="auto">But, as many people said already, supporting all devices is the only correct option if you want broad developer support. After you've dropped gfx906 support on Windows (after it barely started) I don't see any reason to invest development effort in current AMD hardware. And the UDNA news sound like you'll immediately drop all previous architectures upon release.</p>

<p dir="auto">A personalized language-learning app that brings the magic of Duolingo-style lessons to your own curated vocabulary lists and contexts.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/baturyilmaz/wordpecker-app/blob/main/docs/assets/createlist-addword.gif"><img src="https://github.com/baturyilmaz/wordpecker-app/raw/main/docs/assets/createlist-addword.gif" alt="WordPecker App" data-animated-image=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The Idea</h2><a id="user-content-the-idea" aria-label="Permalink: The Idea" href="#the-idea"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Learning a new language can be straightforward, but mastering it is the real challenge. While it's relatively easy to grasp the basics, developing strong communication or reading skills depends on having a solid vocabulary. To build this, you must learn words and phrases at various levels, yet exposure is key. For instance, if you've studied English but don’t live in an English-speaking country, advancing your skills becomes significantly harder. You can read books, watch movies, or browse blogs, but fully immersing yourself in the language is still difficult. Real progress often requires extra effort—studying and revisiting words and phrases encountered in your daily life.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, this process can be inconvenient. You have to pause whatever you’re doing to note new words, search their meanings, record them, and then review them later. This is time-consuming and tiring. As a result, although you might improve, the learning process can feel painfully slow and inefficient.</p>
<p dir="auto">To solve this, I have an idea for an app that merges personalized learning with the efficiency of flashcards—a blend of Duolingo-like lessons and custom study lists.</p>
<p dir="auto">Imagine you’re reading a book—say, Harry Potter. As you come across unfamiliar words, you open the app and create a new list with details like:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Name: Harry Potter Book</li>
<li>Description: The first book in the series</li>
<li>Context: Harry Potter</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Once the list is created, you add the words or phrases you’ve found. The app automatically provides their meanings in context after you save them, so you can continue reading without interruption.</p>
<p dir="auto">Later, you revisit the list and pick one of two options: Learn or Quiz.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Learn: This mode delivers structured lessons in a Duolingo style. Text, visuals, and exercises are dynamically generated using LLMs.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong>: Text-based multiple-choice questions are <em>currently</em> the only question type available.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Quiz: When you’re ready, you can test what you’ve learned through interactive quizzes. They’re engaging and gamified, awarding points and showing your progress. For example, it might indicate you’ve mastered 75% of your list.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong>: The feature that displays something like “You’ve mastered 75% of your list” is planned but not yet built.</p>
<p dir="auto">The key advantage is that the app keeps your learning tied to the context in which you originally saw the words. By returning to them in their original setting, you strengthen those specific neural pathways, speeding up retention and making learning significantly more effective.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>In short, it’s like having a personalized Duolingo where you can create and learn from your own lists. It’s a powerful way to immerse yourself in the language and make steady progress.</strong></p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">1. Introduction</h2><a id="user-content-1-introduction" aria-label="Permalink: 1. Introduction" href="#1-introduction"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1.
DeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrated remarkable performance on reasoning.
With RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors.
However, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance,
we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL.
DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks.
To support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Post-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">We directly apply reinforcement learning (RL) to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">We introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human preferences, as well as two SFT stages that serve as the seed for the model's reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities.
We believe the pipeline will benefit the industry by creating better models.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Distillation: Smaller Models Can Be Powerful Too</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>We demonstrate that the reasoning patterns of larger models can be distilled into smaller models, resulting in better performance compared to the reasoning patterns discovered through RL on small models. The open source DeepSeek-R1, as well as its API, will benefit the research community to distill better smaller models in the future.</li>
<li>Using the reasoning data generated by DeepSeek-R1, we fine-tuned several dense models that are widely used in the research community. The evaluation results demonstrate that the distilled smaller dense models perform exceptionally well on benchmarks. We open-source distilled 1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, and 70B checkpoints based on Qwen2.5 and Llama3 series to the community.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <section id="sec1-drones-08-00652" type="intro"><h2 data-nested="1">  1. Introduction</h2><p>Celestial navigation is among the oldest forms of navigation in aviation [<a href="#B1-drones-08-00652">1</a>]. The abundance of salient stars, known to high levels of precision, make them a useful cue for navigators when operating in clear conditions. The elevation of a star above the horizon would be measured, yielding a ‘line of position’. This process was repeated with different stars to fully determine the navigator’s position. The advancement of imaging and computing hardware saw the integration of autonomous star trackers into manned aircraft, as seen, for example, in Lockheed’s SR-71. These autonomous star trackers consisted of a mechanically stabilized telescope and inertial sensors, whose observations, when combined, could produce position estimates to within 0.3 nautical miles for up to 10 h of operation. While accurate, these sensors tended to be both heavy and voluminous, making them undesirable for more modern Size, Weight and Power Constrained (SWAP-C) applications.</p><p>By the advent of the 21st century, Global Positioning System (GPS) had become ubiquitous in avionic navigation. The introduction of GPS caused the interest in celestial navigation to wither due to its relative inaccuracy. Consequently, celestial navigation is primarily seen only in space-based systems, whose orientation must be known to high levels of precision. Nonetheless, celestial navigation was identified as a desirable alternative to GPS [<a href="#B2-drones-08-00652">2</a>], primarily due its robustness against potential jamming. Critically, few GPS-denied alternatives exist that are capable of using passive sensors to estimate global position at night or over the ocean. For this reason, celestial navigation remains an important topic of research. The methodology presented in this paper demonstrates how celestial navigation may be utilized on low cost Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that lack the precision of an expensive Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS).</p><p>Existing works on strapdown celestial navigation tend to be focused on simulation. One such example derives the equations for a celestial camera mounted directly to a strapdown inertial system [<a href="#B3-drones-08-00652">3</a>]. Similarly, a more recent study identified that a strapdown celestial system is contingent on the initial conditions and will tend to diverge over time [<a href="#B4-drones-08-00652">4</a>]. While some promise has been shown in the utility of such systems [<a href="#B5-drones-08-00652">5</a>], the primary problem with the navigation method is that the strapdown system must estimate the camera biases and delineate these from true position error. This is difficult to achieve, as camera bias is perceptually identical to motion over the Earth. Utilizing the celestial system as a highly accurate attitude reference tends to produce useful results in high altitude aircraft [<a href="#B6-drones-08-00652">6</a>] and spacecraft [<a href="#B7-drones-08-00652">7</a>,<a href="#B8-drones-08-00652">8</a>,<a href="#B9-drones-08-00652">9</a>,<a href="#B10-drones-08-00652">10</a>,<a href="#B11-drones-08-00652">11</a>]; however, as a modular solution, the celestial system must have a direct input to the AHRS to improve the inertial position estimate. Alternatively, it has been theoretically shown that atmospheric refraction can be observed to resolve positions [<a href="#B12-drones-08-00652">12</a>]. This technique relies on the observation of the atmospheric refraction of starlight, which occurs most significantly closest to the horizon. The angle of refraction tends to be minimal and difficult to observe, requiring a highly stabilized viewing platform.</p><p>There are a number of reasons why celestial navigation has not become ubiquitous in aviation and particularly in UAV applications. Firstly, there is significant complexity in designing and configuring the hardware. A celestial system must typically be gimballed to within arcminutes of precision, such that a narrow field of a view sensor may lock onto a single star. This could be achieved through gyroscopic stabilization; however, the inclusion of multiple kilograms of stabilization hardware is rarely justified to achieve a navigation outcome with significantly worse performance than GPS. Secondly, celestial systems require a clear view of the night sky, which places practical limitations on their use. Thirdly, alongside the mechanical complexity, there exists a significant computational complexity required to integrate a celestial payload into an existing system. A star database must be maintained, image processing algorithms must be implemented to identify and track stars, and the system may or may not require an interface for the existing AHRS to time and orientate data. These reasons have overshadowed the benefit of having an additional GPS-denied modality for navigation available to an aircraft.</p><p>Previous research has addressed the latter of these points, demonstrating that modern computer vision libraries and embedded hardware are capable of handling the computational requirements of celestial navigation [<a href="#B13-drones-08-00652">13</a>,<a href="#B14-drones-08-00652">14</a>]. We address the first of these points in this study by demonstrating the use of a strapdown celestial system for navigation. Contrary to the stabilized alternative, a strapdown celestial system contains low mechanical complexity, is lightweight, and can be implemented at a low cost. The primary trade-off is in the accuracy of the navigation system. While high levels of accuracy are theoretically achievable (depending on the quality of the optical system), the limiting factor with strapdown celestial navigation is the accuracy of the AHRS. As a rough guide, an attitude error of 1° correlates with a position error of approximately 100&nbsp;km. It is not uncommon for low cost autopilots (such as the Cube Orange running ArduPlane v4.5 firmware) to produce attitude errors in the vicinity of multiple degrees. Such biases would lead to positional offsets that are far too significant for use in any real application.</p><p>We address this shortcoming by demonstrating how a simple orbital motion can significantly improve a celestial position estimate. This technique has been used on the ground to correct for boresight errors [<a href="#B15-drones-08-00652">15</a>], and we demonstrate through experimentation that a similar technique may be used on aircraft to correct for attitude errors. The principle behind this maneuver is that a misaligned boresight will trace a circle about the true boresight if a full azimuthal revolution is performed. The misalignment presents itself in the navigation frame as a circular error in latitude and longitude, enabling the averaging of the results to attain an improved position estimate. We demonstrate that this technique is effective even when the camera is misaligned with the AHRS, offering a reliable method for estimating the position to within 4&nbsp;km from an unknown state. While lacking precision, this method of localization is absolute, cheap to implement, and relatively lightweight.</p><p>To our knowledge, no such technique currently exists in the literature. The methods proposed here are intended to demonstrate the application of strapdown celestial navigation on a fixed-wing drone platform, while addressing the key practical difficulties in doing so. Existing works are iterative, relying on the integration of celestial measurements with inertial measurements using a filter such as an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) or Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). This research demonstrates that a strapdown system can be treated as a stand-alone, modular addition to an inertial system, such that the measurements do not need to be integrated into the filter. Independence from an inertial filter enables the celestial system to produce true global position measurements that are not affected by initial conditions. Provided the use of an accurate clock, the results presented in this paper will not degrade over time.</p><p>The remainder of this paper addresses the theory, implementation, and results of the proposed method. We outline the equations for observing stars and estimating global positions in <a href="#sec2-drones-08-00652">Section 2</a>, we describe the methdology used in star detection/tracking and the experimental configuration, we explicitly define the equations for computing the mean position in <a href="#sec3-drones-08-00652">Section 3</a>, we present the results from the flight trial and simulation in <a href="#sec4-drones-08-00652">Section 4</a>, we discuss the results in <a href="#sec5-drones-08-00652">Section 5</a>, and we conclude in <a href="#sec6-drones-08-00652">Section 6</a>.</p></section><section id="sec2-drones-08-00652" type=""><h2 data-nested="1">  2.

For the purposes of this study, we assume that the precise orientation of the camera remains unknown, and we consequently accept that the individual position estimates will be erroneous. It will be shown later that this misalignment may be overcome through the use of averaging. This is particularly useful given that the camera itself may be mounted separately from the autopilot, thus being subjected to factors such as vibration, aerodynamic loading, or changes in AHRS biases, which cause the relative orientation between the AHRS and the camera to change over time.</p></div><section id="sec3dot1-drones-08-00652" type=""><h4 data-nested="2">  3.1.

Experimental Configuration</h4><p>Celestial imagery was captured in-flight from a 4 m flying wing UAV. The selected autopilot (Cube Orange) was mounted at the center of mass, and the celestial payload was mounted in the shoulder of the aircraft (see <a href="#drones-08-00652-f003">Figure 3</a>). The celestial payload collected imagery at a rate of 10 &nbsp;Hz, as well as the attitude and position data from the autopilot, enabling post-analysis. A Raspberry Pi 5 (Raspberry Pi Ltd., Cambridge, UK) was used as the companion computer, interfacing with the celestial camera and the autopilot. An Alvium 1800 U-240 (Allied Vision, Stradtroda, Germany) monochrome sensor fitted with a f/1.4 6 mm wide angle lens was chosen for the imaging system. A serial Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UART) link between the Raspberry Pi and the Cube Orange facilitated the transport of MAVLink v2.0 messages. The AHRS data from ArduPlane’s EKF3 was recorded at a rate of 30&nbsp;Hz, and the ground truth GPS position data were recorded at a rate of 10&nbsp;Hz. The Raspberry Pi clock was synchronized with GPS time prior to takeoff. The Raspberry Pi and the camera were mounted on a PLA 3D-printed structure (see <a href="#drones-08-00652-f004">Figure 4</a>) for integration into the airframe.</p><p>The test flight was conducted on a moonless night. The wind was modest, typically remaining below 5&nbsp;m/s. The flight plan consisted of both straight legs and orbital trajectories with varying radii. An overview of the flight plan can be seen in <a href="#drones-08-00652-t001">Table 1</a>.</p><p>The total flight lasted 72 min. Astronomical twilight ceased at 19:32, and takeoff was conducted at 19:53. The GPS receiver in the aircraft was not allowed to be switched off to enable emergency failsafes and prevent fence breaches. We address the consequences of this in <a href="#sec4dot4-drones-08-00652">Section 4.4</a>.</p></section><section id="sec3dot3-drones-08-00652" type=""><h4 data-nested="2">  3.3.

Assuming that an attempt is made to mount the camera in alignment with the autopilot, an initial DCM may be formulated from some combination of 90° Euler rotations. It will be seen that as long as this orientation is accurate to within a hemisphere of tolerance, the exact value does not matter, as it will be recalculated in flight.</p></div><div><p>If a minimum of six stars are visible within the frame, a Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) approach to position estimation may be used to remove bias from false detections. RANSAC is a technique used to identify outliers in sample data and omit them from the estimation process. This is useful for detecting misidentified stars or for removing non-star detections (such as satellites or overhead planes). In the context of position estimation, the RANSAC algorithm randomly selects three stars to generate a position estimate. Subsequently, the algorithm compares the location of the remaining stars against the position estimate. If the remaining stars are within some heuristic tolerance, they are considered inliers. If they are outside of tolerance, they are considered outliers. The position estimate which minimizes the mean squared error of the inliers is chosen as the estimate. A pseudocode implementation of this RANSAC position estimation is outlined in Algorithm 1.

In an integrated solution, the celestial system would provide attitude measurements to the EKF, and the offset from this attitude would be estimated.

Testing over an 89 s section of flat and level flight, it can be seen in <a href="#drones-08-00652-f005">Figure 5</a> that the camera roll angle shifts by approximately 0.2°, the pitch angle shifts by approximately 0.05°, and the yaw angle shifts by approximately 0.3°. In the context of celestial navigation, these are significant perturbances which, had the offsets been attributed to position as opposed to camera orientation, would have been interpreted as around 30&nbsp;km of positional offset. Indeed, by assuming that </p><math display="inline"><semantics>

Over an extended period (hours), the orientation may shift such that positional errors are in the range of hundreds of kilometers.</p></div><p>It is clear that a stand-alone celestial module cannot function in the conventional manner with consumer-grade hardware, unless the autopilot is capable of integrating the attitude output from the celestial system into its own filter and estimating the camera orientation. We will demonstrate now a method which, given a very rough initial estimate of the camera orientation, is capable of returning position estimates to within 4&nbsp;km. This is significant in the context of long flights, where alternative dead-reckoning solutions would experience positional drift that is either linear (assuming velocity measurements are available) or quadratic (assuming only acceleration measurements) as a function of time.</p><div><p>By performing a rotation through 360° of compass heading, at an approximately constant yaw rate, the position estimates can be averaged to find an approximation of the orbital center.

Alternatively, it is possible to repeat an orbit and calculate a new set of latitudes and longitudes. This method does not require post hoc processing and may be better suited to real-time applications. For the purposes of this study, we use the former method, as this allows us to treat each orbit as an independent sample, yielding an independent position estimate, thus giving us deeper insight into how the characteristics of a given orbit affect the position estimate. An example of this process can be seen in <a href="#drones-08-00652-f007">Figure 7</a>.</p></div></section></section><section id="sec4-drones-08-00652" type="results"><h2 data-nested="1">  4.

Estimation Accuracy</h4><div><p>It can be seen that the orbits which are neither climbing nor descending produced more accurate positional data. These orbits had larger radii, which consequently produced greater numbers of position estimates per orbit. Additionally, the variance in the pitch and roll axis during ascent/descent tends to be greater, as the total energy control system utilizes the pitch axis to throttle the climb/descent rate. By taking these two factors into account, we calculate the standard error as a function of the covariance in pitch and roll, as well as the number of samples. The generalized variance is calculated by taking the determinant of the covariance matrix in pitch and roll, where this matrix is given by

Initial Conditions</h4><div><p>We demonstrate here that the initial value of the camera rotation matrix has little effect on the final position estimate. This is significant because, as shown in <a href="#sec3-drones-08-00652">Section 3</a>, many factors may cause changes in the relative orientation between the camera and the AHRS. Choosing orbit 5 as an example, we show that as long as the estimated boresight of the camera is accurate to within a hemisphere of tolerance (that is, the estimated boresight is within </p><math display="inline"><semantics>

A graphical representation of the first iteration given various camera calibrations is shown in <a href="#drones-08-00652-f009">Figure 9</a>. In each case, with a position error less than 90°, the position estimate converged to within the estimated CEP. It can be seen in <a href="#drones-08-00652-t003">Table 3</a> that an initial calibration error beyond 90° results in a position estimate on the opposite side of the Earth.</p></div></section><section id="sec4dot4-drones-08-00652" type=""><h4 data-nested="2">  4.4. Simulation of Wind Effects</h4><p>The flight trial was conducted with modest amounts of wind, utilizing GPS to conduct an orbit. We postulate that in the presence of wind, the position is better attained by fixing the pitch and roll of the aircraft, such that a constant yaw rate is achieved in the local NED frame. This approach does not require GPS to perform an orbit and only relies on compass heading and inertial attitude sensors to follow a trajectory. Simulation results strongly indicate that GPS is not required but is in fact detrimental to the orbital method of position estimation. As a consequence of not using GPS, the aircraft is subjected to lateral drift in the local NED frame. The amount of drift experienced by the aircraft during an orbit is, however, minimal in comparison to the scale to which position is being estimated.</p><p>We used JSBSim to simulate the aircraft’s flight dynamics, in conjunction with Ardupilot’s software-in-the-loop simulator to generate synthesized motion-blurred imagery. The images were generated following the methodology in [<a href="#B13-drones-08-00652">13</a>], factoring in the motion blur experienced by the camera. A strong southerly wind of 54 km/h was added to the simulation. An orbit was performed using GPS, and another was performed using a fixed pitch and roll angle with GPS disabled. During the fixed-attitude orbit, the aircraft drifted 1.05 km. The simulated trajectory of the GPS-denied orbit can be seen in <a href="#drones-08-00652-f010">Figure 10</a>.</p><p>Applying the same methodology, the position was calculated for both the GPS-guided orbit and the GPS-denied orbit. The control protocol of the GPS-guided orbit was to maintain a ground track at a fixed radius about a point in an identical manner to what was performed in the real flight test. This method adjusts the pitch and roll of the vehicle to compensate for wind and altitude. Up-wind sections of the orbit are prolonged in time, and down-wind sections are contracted in time. The resulting position estimates are heavily biased towards the prolonged portion of the orbit, which consequently skews the mean calculation. Under high wind conditions, it can be seen that following a fixed-radius ground track is not optimal for position calculation. The resulting position error was 18.27 km, as seen in <a href="#drones-08-00652-f011">Figure 11</a>. By contrast, the fixed-attitude orbit achieved a position error of 2.29 km, despite being subjected to over 1 km of drift. This highlights the importance of fixing the aircraft attitude rather than following a constant-radius orbit.</p></section></section><section id="sec5-drones-08-00652" type="discussion"><h2 data-nested="1">  5. Discussion</h2><p>The results presented in <a href="#sec4-drones-08-00652">Section 4</a> demonstrate that strapdown celestial navigation as a modular solution has potential use in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied UAV navigation. The celestial camera was mounted to the airframe, separate from the autopilot, but still utilizing the AHRS orientation information coming from the autopilot. This has significant implications for integration into SWAP-C airframes, in which the inclusion of stabilization hardware adds unwanted mass. With a modern GPS receiver weighing only a few grams and producing estimates to within 1m accuracy, it is understandable that, given the choice, an alternative celestial navigation solution would not be included. Yet, GNSS denial is increasing in prevalence, and alternative navigation solutions must be explored if a UAV is to operate under such circumstances.</p><p>The most profound outcome from this study is the celestial system’s independence from the initial conditions. Provided a functional AHRS and navigation system which is capable of performing an orbit, the celestial system can produce a position estimate from any unknown position on the globe, with a camera that is aligned to within 90°. The remaining source of error lies in the clock drift, which is typically equal to 3 ppm (0.3 s per 24 h) for a modern real-time clock. This has significant implications for long endurance aircraft, which may need to operate for many hours in RF contested environments. It has been shown that the rate of divergence in dead reckoning navigation is substantial without a velocity estimate [<a href="#B22-drones-08-00652">22</a>], particularly in consumer grade systems. Even with velocity measurements, in the presence of wind, a tactical grade aircraft may drift by 10 km per hour. In such cases, over the course of multiple hours, the precision offered by the proposed method is a vast improvement.</p><p>For loitering aircraft, this method of localization is convenient, as the flight plan need not change. For aircraft travelling significant distances, it may be sufficient to intermittently perform a single orbit, and utilize the more erroneous position estimate for course correction. The act of performing an orbit through a full compass rotation effectively nullifies the biases and offsets between the AHRS and the celestial camera. The main source of error for each independent position estimate during an orbit, is the misalignment of the estimated zenith with the true zenith. This may be caused by a number of factors, such as aerodynamic loading causing minor perturbations in the camera’s orientation relative to the autopilot, improper alignment or calibration of the inertial system, or simply due to estimation errors caused by improperly estimated centrifugal acceleration. In each of these cases, it is expected that the error remains approximately constant throughout an orbit. Consequently, zenith errors at one particular azimuth are cancelled out by the zenith errors at the opposing (180° offset) azimuth. This is the reason why such a method is capable of working with almost arbitrary levels of initial error.</p><p>This flight was conducted using GPS to maintain the orbital position. We recognize that, in a true GNSS denied environment, wind errors will cause the aircraft to drift during an orbit. While this may introduce some error into the position estimate, we show in <a href="#sec4-drones-08-00652">Section 4</a> that the primary factor governing the accuracy of a position estimate is the variance in the zenith-angle throughout the orbit. The circular position errors seen for example in <a href="#drones-08-00652-f007">Figure 7</a>, are not caused by the change in aircraft position. They are caused by a misalignment of the optical system, and consequently may be reproduced by simply maintaining constant roll and pitch throughout a full compass rotation. In <a href="#sec4dot4-drones-08-00652">Section 4.4</a> we show that even in high wind conditions, the appropriate strategy is to maintain roll rate and accept that there will be positional drift throughout the orbit. This strongly suggests that the presence of GPS during the flight test offered no advantages to the algorithm.</p><p>An obvious limitation of this method is its dependence on sky visibility. Some research has shown that short-wave infrared cameras offer a daylight visible alternative to visible spectrum cameras [<a href="#B23-drones-08-00652">23</a>,<a href="#B24-drones-08-00652">24</a>]. These tend to have far lower signal-to-noise ratios, resulting in more erroneous measurements. It may be the case that the proposed positioning method is capable of nullifying the increased observational error from short-wave infrared observations. This may be a potential topic for future research.</p></section><section id="sec6-drones-08-00652" type="conclusions"><h2 data-nested="1">  6. Conclusions</h2><p>This study proposed a method for obtaining more accurate positional estimates from a modular strapdown celestial navigation system. We hypothesized that by flying in an orbital motion, the errors in estimated zenith angles would cancel one another at opposing azimuths. The methodology was tested in a real flight, demonstrating that the position can be routinely estimated to within 4 km by performing orbits at a fixed altitude and airspeed. Throughout each orbit, positional estimates are generated from the individual celestial images, and these positions are averaged at the conclusion of the orbit. We show that by recursively estimating the mean position and using this position to recalibrate the orientation of the camera, the algorithm is capable of converging near the true location. Testing found that the algorithm is robust against initial conditions, requiring no knowledge of the prior position and only requiring the camera to be aligned to within a hemisphere of tolerance.</p></section>

    <p>Do you have a phone, tablet, or laptop (or, well, any device…) which will only take a physical SIM, but with which you’d like to use eSIMs?</p>
<p>Then this is a blogpost for you, as that’s exactly what this is: a physical SIM, onto which one can provision eSIMs, using software to swap between them.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-bought-from-9esim">What I bought from 9eSIM</h2>
<p>I bought the bundle - SIM and smartcard reader - from <a href="https://www.9esim.com/">9eSIM</a>.</p>
<p>The first shipment from China got lost but, after a bit of waiting, they posted another one without complaint. That was shipped by a different delivery company, and it arrived in just over a week.</p>
<p>In the box, I got:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A SIM card, with the usual push-out sections to change it from normal to micro to nano.</p>
<ul>
<li>The SIM was in a blue envelope, not attached to the cardboard saying “9eSIM v2” - at first, I thought “they’ve forgotten to put in the SIM card”.</li>
<li>If you want to use the smartcard reader, <em>do not discard the SIM’s packaging</em>. You will need it to make the smartcard reader work reliably.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A SIM card adapter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A USB smartcard reader, and a USB-A to USB-C adapter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Including delivery, it came to about £30.</p>
<h2 id="use-the-sims-packaging-to-make-it-fit-in-the-smartcard-reader">Use the SIM’s packaging to make it fit in the smartcard reader</h2>
<p>I spent a <em>lot</em> of time trying to get the SIM and smartcard reader working.</p>
<p>The solution was a frustratingly simple one: the best way to use the supplied smartcard reader is to use the original packaging for the SIM.</p>
<p>This packaging is the right size to slide into the reader while positioning the SIM’s contacts over the contact points on the reader. I will keep that together with the smartcard reader.</p>
<p>When I realised that - rather than trying to slide the popped-out SIM into the right place and keep it there - it Just Worked.</p>
<h2 id="adding-and-switching-esims">Adding and switching eSIMs</h2>
<p>The SIM card is advertised as have “a memory capacity of 1.6M, [which] can store up to 50 groups of eSIM profile data”.</p>
<p>To make use of it, one needs to download one or more eSIMs to the SIM.</p>
<p>To do this, and to switch between profiles, one needs to use a “Local Profile Agent” (or “LPA”).</p>
<p>I tested the process for this using both Android and Linux, and both worked just fine.</p>
<h2 id="test-esim-profiles-you-can-try-to-for-free">Test eSIM profiles you can try to for free</h2>
<p>While I was getting used to how it worked, I didn’t want to buy an actual eSIM.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are a couple of options.</p>
<p>First, there are four official <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/core/connect/esim-test-profiles">Android test eSIM profiles</a></p>
<p>While I could start to provision these, I could not download them, with what appears to be a TLS error.</p>
<p>Second, osmocom has a <a href="https://euicc-manual.osmocom.org/docs/rsp/known-test-profile/">very useful page of other test profiles</a>.</p>
<p>I was able to install test eSIM profiles for <a href="https://qr.esim.tf/1$rsp.truphone.com$QR-G-5C-1LS-1W1Z9P7">TruPhone</a> and <a href="https://qr.esim.tf/1$rsp.truphone.com$QRF-SPEEDTEST">TruPhone / Speedtest</a>.</p>
<p>These provisioned correctly onto the SIM. I could not use them to make or receive calls or start a data session - which was fine - but they did show up in Android’s SIM card manager as available eSIMs.</p>
<h2 id="adding-and-switching-esims-via-android">Adding and switching eSIMs via Android</h2>
<p>There is an .apk from the 9eSIM site.</p>
<p>I wasn’t too keen on using this but, well, it worked, and is probably the simplest option.</p>
<p>I tested it first by putting the SIM into my phone, replacing my main physical SIM. This was recognised by the app immediately.</p>
<p>Once I had worked out how to correctly seat the SIM in the reader, I tried that too, using a USB-C hub to connect the smartcard reader to my phone. That worked fine too.</p>
<p>Provisioning eSIMs using the Android application was easy as long as the QR code was on a different screen, since I could just scan the QR code for the eSIM using the camera. I’ve not looked to see if there is a way to use Android to import a QR code on its own screen.</p>
<p>Using the 9eSIM application, one can enable and disable eSIMs, and swap between them. Once enabled, they appeared in Android’s own SIM management settings. I did not need to reboot.</p>
<p>Deleting an eSIM is also easy. One needs to type a security phrase - the name of the eSIM - to trigger deletion, which is a simple means of avoiding accidental deletion.</p>
<h2 id="adding-and-switching-esims-via-linux">Adding and switching eSIMs via Linux</h2>
<p>Since I want to use the SIM with the integrated WWAN modem of a laptop running Linux, I was keen to see if I could get this all to work using Linux and Free software.</p>
<p>So far, I have not found a way of writing profiles to the SIM while it is in the laptop - I need to take it out and put it in the smartcard reader.</p>
<p>And, if I’m going to do that then, from a practical point of view, it is little more effort to hook it up to my phone and swap and provisions eSIMs from there.</p>
<p>Still, I wanted to get it working within Linux and FOSS just because.</p>

</code></pre><p>I spent quite a long time trying to work out why it would not detect the SIM in the smartcard reader (which, as above, was solved by using the supplied packaging material).</p>
<p>I have not reproduced all my troubleshooting here, but it was reasonably obvious from the error messages that, while my laptop recognised and could talk to the smartcard reader, the SIM was not recognised.</p>
<h3 id="lpac"><code>lpac</code></h3>

<pre tabindex="0"><code>sudo apt install lpac_2.1.0_amd64.deb -y

<p><code>lpac</code>’s output is in json, so run it through <code>jq</code> to prettify it.</p>

<p>Lyca’s email gave me a QR code, but did not specify (explicitly) the SM-DP+ address or matching ID.</p>
<p>The image’s alt-text was just my order number with Lyca.</p>
<p>I used GNOME’s <a href="https://apps.gnome.org/en-GB/Decoder/">“Decoder”</a>, which lets one scan a QR card either from the device’s camera or from a screenshot.</p>
<p>That gave me the full activation code, which looked like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>LPA:1$dp-plus-par07-01.oasis-smartsim.com$XHY48-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx$x.x.x.x.x.x.xxxxx.x.x.x.x

<p>This too failed using <code>lpac</code>.</p>
<p>I have not dug into <em>why</em> it failed.</p>
<p>I missed the opportunity to test extracting the parameters and pushing them manually into <code>lpac</code> via <code>-s</code> and <code>-m</code> as I had already used EasyLPAC at that point. I suspect that that would have worked.</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: doh, it is just a matter of quoting the string, with single quotes. So:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>lpac profile download -a 'LPA:1$rsp.truphone.com$QRF-BETTERROAMING-PMRDGIR2EARDEIT5'
</code></pre><p>How embarrassing.</p>
<p>I tried to update the <code>lpac</code> documentation to make this more obvious, but <a href="https://github.com/estkme-group/lpac/pull/183#issuecomment-2602304507">the maintainer decided that it wasn’t needed</a>. So I guess this blogpost will have to do :)</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://toot.wales/@tswsl">Tom</a> for that :)</p>
<h3 id="linux-gui-easylpac">Linux GUI: EasyLPAC</h3>
<p>There is a GUI for <code>lpac</code>, called <a href="https://github.com/creamlike1024/EasyLPAC">EasyLPAC</a>.</p>
<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/creamlike1024/EasyLPAC/releases/tag/0.7.7.2">the latest Github release</a>, with the version of <code>lpac</code> that I had already installed.</p>
<p>I did not install it; I just ran it, and it worked.</p>
<p>I tested, on a different machine, the version of EasyLPAC which comes with <code>lpac</code> included, but I could not get this to work. I did not pursue this.</p>
<p>I was able to download an eSIM using EasyLPAC in a few different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>having an LPA:1 activation code on the system clipboard</li>
<li>having a QR code image on the system clipboard</li>
<li>“scanning an image file”, which consisted of opening a QR code saved as an image file on my computer</li>
</ul>
<p>It was really quite straightforward.</p>
<p>I noted that the instructions say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Reading LPA activation code and QRCode from clipboard not working in Wayland</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But they did work for me, using Wayland.</p>
<p>Importing the LycaMobile eSIM, using the details extracted from the QR code, worked.</p>
<h2 id="connectivity-worked-fine-via-linux">Connectivity worked fine via Linux</h2>
<p>I put the 9eSIM into my laptop’s SIM slot, and booted it.</p>
<p>In GNOME’s “Mobile Network” settings, it was recognised as a LycaMobile SIM.</p>
<p>I had to set the APN manually.</p>
<p>It took a couple of minutes for the eSIM to activate and, once activated, I was able to browse the Internet.</p>
<p>So there we go: an eSIM on a physical SIM on a laptop running Debian, with very little effort.</p>
<h2 id="other-options">Other options</h2>
<p>I quite like the look of <a href="https://shop.sysmocom.de/sysmoEUICC1-eUICC-for-consumer-eSIM-RSP/sysmoEUICC1">this Sysmocom SIM</a>.</p>
<p>I’d be interested in giving that a try some point.</p>

    <p data-sourcepos="1:1-1:346"><em>Nota bene: I’ve had a rough 2025 so far. I’m worried that people who used to support, or at least tolerate me, will turn against me out of a desire to conform, to show their obeisance, to the current prevailing winds. I found myself writing this essay to explain why I’ve been feeling so miserable. I sent it to Paul before I published it here.</em></p>
<p data-sourcepos="3:1-3:23">I met Paul Graham once.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="5:1-5:217">It was the summer of 2015, and we were attending Y Combinator, the premier finishing school for startup founders. It was a long and stressful summer, holed up in our apartment in Mountain View, and a great experience.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="7:1-7:44">We benefitted immensely from our time there.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="9:1-9:322">At Y Combinator, there was sort of a curriculum, but they didn’t teach you anything per se. You’re assigned mentors, who you meet weekly, and you are free to book office hours – thirty minutes at a time – with a rotating cast of partners, each and every one of them formidable people, near or at the top of the field.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="11:1-11:74">The mentors applied a neat and very effective trick: they believed in you.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="13:1-13:250">Out of thousands of applicants, you had been chosen, plucked from obscurity, and flown out, and now you were here, in the centre of the (software) universe. They had invested in you, you personally, above and beyond your specific idea for a business.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="15:1-15:182">Now every week you spoke with them, and presented your metrics, and discussed your problems, and, well, you could be doing better, couldn’t you? These results, they were kind of mid.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="17:1-17:299">They didn’t boss us around, or tell us what to do, but we didn’t want to disappoint teacher. Their approval meant a lot. Doors would open. Success was at our fingertips: the summer culminated in Demo Day, a cattle call where we would be presented to investors, and our future might change forever.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="19:1-19:214">We worked harder. We learned how to hustle. We swallowed rejection. We doubled our efforts, bent over our desks, working until we could barely see straight, trying to figure out how to <em>make something people want</em>.</p>
<hr data-sourcepos="21:1-22:0">
<p data-sourcepos="23:1-23:255">One day, we booked a meeting with pg (Paul Graham). He had just retired from the day to day running of the show, handed the reigns over to sama (Sam Altman), and now roamed the halls as an elder statesmen, a congenial and affable uncle, dispensing advice.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="25:1-25:443">We were excited. I don’t think he was ever a <em>hero</em> of mine, but he certainly had influence, made a big impression on me. I had read his essays eight or nine years earlier, during my undergraduate, hunched over a screen in my university’s computer lab, nodding along. I spent way too much time on hackernews. Lisp was cool, I was special for just taking an interest in startups and software, we could do anything if we worked hard enough.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="27:1-27:142">We explained our pitch to him: Appcanary monitors your apps and servers, and lets you know when you’re affected by a security vulnerability.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="29:1-29:278">He thought it was a decent enough idea, but the name, Appcanary, he wasn’t crazy about the name. He was very good at naming companies. He thought about it and told us that, really, we ought to be named Oracle, that would be a great name for us. Descriptive, simple, memorable.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="31:1-31:27">Shame it was taken, though.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="33:1-33:78">We nodded and thanked him, and laughed about it later. No one bats a thousand.</p>
<hr data-sourcepos="35:1-36:0">
<p data-sourcepos="37:1-37:41">YC had a huge positive impact on my life.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="39:1-39:174">People took us more seriously now. Before we were randos, misfits even, but now we were Princes of the Universe. We had rubbed shoulders with royalty, or at least sovereigns.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="41:1-41:87">Someone had believed in us, and pushed us until we understood how to make our own luck.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="43:1-43:360">We grew a lot that summer, but we didn’t raise that much money. A bit, enough to keep us going. I loved California, I liked San Francisco, but I didn’t feel comfortable trying to live there. I felt gross being part of a monied class in a city rapidly hollowing out. I’d had a precarious childhood and early adulthood, and I craved some kind of stability.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="45:1-45:276">Back home, we lived in the Best Neighbourhood in the Last Affordable Apartment In West Toronto. We knew it would reduce our chances for success, but it would double our runway. In the winter, I had started dating this most amazing girl, and I wanted to see where it would go.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="47:1-47:423">Two years later, we realized that everyone thought our product was useful but not <em>that</em> useful. We could get people to pay us hundreds of dollars per month, but not thousands. That’s the death knell of a vc-backed b2b saas sales model. High-touch sales to large companies is not worth it unless you can score thousands of dollars per month. We were too burnt out to pivot to another business idea, and we quietly folded.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="49:1-49:490">It was good timing: almost immediately after, GitHub announced they were going to provide our startup’s features <strong>for free</strong>. We gave them a call, we got them excited. They “acquihired” us as subject matter experts, and paid us a small fee for the intellectual property. We returned something like 40 or 45 cents on the dollar to our investors. Not a great result, but about par for the course. Most startups fail. Some of our Summer 2015 cohort flamed out faster, or more spectacularly.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="51:1-51:95">One of our investors commended us for our ethical behaviour – not everyone returns the money.</p>
<hr data-sourcepos="53:1-54:0">
<p data-sourcepos="55:1-55:137">It’s been almost ten years. After we got hired, Microsoft bought GitHub. I’m still with that amazing girl. We have two kids, a house.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="57:1-57:22">I’m transgender now.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="59:1-59:423">It turns out that I like women so much I’d like to be one of them. Or as close as I can get. I’m happier now, more joyful. I feel in touch with my body, and how I move through the world, in ways I didn’t before. Up until very recently, very few people would confuse me for a woman. It took me a while to remove my facial hair, I still haven’t trained my voice. That’s OK. What is a woman, exactly? I don’t know.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="61:1-61:258">I don’t want to make anyone uncomfortable. For that reason, I like to say that I am “non-binary trans femme”. It’s a mouthful, I know. But asking to be called “they” feels less burdensome, less of a polite fiction, than to ask to be called “she”.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="63:1-63:92">I just want to be treated with respect, and kindness. I don’t think I’m asking for much.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="65:1-65:77">Why is it wrong for me to have more joy in my life? I’m not hurting anyone.</p>
<hr data-sourcepos="67:1-68:0">
<p data-sourcepos="69:1-69:65">A few days ago, Paul Graham published an essay on “Wokeness”.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="71:1-71:436">I skimmed it. I couldn’t finish reading it, it made me too upset. It came a few days after Mark Zuckerberg announced he was going to increase the hate speech people like me receive. It’s not OK to imply someone has a mental disability – unless it’s because they’re queer. He also quietly removed some trivial accomodations he had made for his transgender employees.<sup><a href="http://okayfail.com/2025/i-met-pg-once.html#fn-accomodations" id="fnref-accomodations" data-footnote-ref="">1</a></sup>  <em>That</em> stung. That felt personal, targeted.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="75:1-75:93">I’ve been feeling quite anxious ever since. It feels like the world is crumbling around me.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="77:1-77:352">I’m still not sure what pg thinks “Wokeness” means.<sup><a href="http://okayfail.com/2025/i-met-pg-once.html#fn-performative" id="fnref-performative" data-footnote-ref="">2</a></sup> I know for a fact, that for most people – including many of the people he hangs out with – it just means “left-wing thing I dislike”. I got the impression that he thinks it’s bad, and that companies should purge people who are too woke. Maybe I’m being unfair to him.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="81:1-81:255">The irony is I too dislike nagging, hollow, corporate DEI exercises. In the abstract I was glad they existed<sup><a href="http://okayfail.com/2025/i-met-pg-once.html#fn-dei" id="fnref-dei" data-footnote-ref="">3</a></sup> but the insincerity was palpable. Are “identity politics” just a status game that economically advantaged elites play? I could be convinced.</p>
<hr data-sourcepos="85:1-86:0">
<p data-sourcepos="87:1-87:161">In the 2021 novel “Detransition Baby” the author shares a joke. Transgender women only have one of three jobs: computer programmer, aesthetician, prostitute.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="89:1-89:518">It’s an old joke. More of an observation, really. The director of “Vestidas de Azul”, <a href="https://thefilmstage.com/dressed-in-blue-review-a-long-lost-essential-document-of-spanish-and-lgbtqi-cinema-history-gets-new-life/">a 1983 documentary about trans women in Madrid</a>, had hoped to make a movie about trans women who were lawyers or held important roles in society. Instead he discovered that most trans women were <strong>forced</strong> to be artists, hair dressers, or sex workers – so that’s who he made his movie about.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="91:1-91:79">I’m glad I can be a computer programmer; no one gets to be an artist anymore.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="93:1-93:223">If you haven’t met many trans women, that might sound over-the-top, hyperbolic. But for so long, people like me were strongly discriminated against. Until very recently, we were treated as bywords for freaks, or psycopaths.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="95:1-95:239">In this vein, the other day I saw a scorching, sizzling hot take on Mastodon that read something like: the reason why conservative women are so mad about trans women is because they don’t want to share washrooms with the sex slave caste.</p>
<hr data-sourcepos="97:1-98:0">
<p data-sourcepos="99:1-99:255">The reason why pg’s essay made me so upset, made me feel so dispirited, is because I benefitted directly from his largesse, from a system he set up. His “school” took a chance on me, taught me how to hustle, how to become a Princess of the Universe.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="101:1-101:73">I’m immensely glad for the opportunity. Would I receive it again today?</p>
<p data-sourcepos="103:1-103:262">In many people’s imagination, the word “woke” invokes someone exactly like me. I’m the person who is annoying about their pronouns. I’m the person who feels more comfortable using gender neutral bathrooms.<sup><a href="http://okayfail.com/2025/i-met-pg-once.html#fn-bathrooms" id="fnref-bathrooms" data-footnote-ref="">4</a></sup> I have a passing interest in social justice.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="107:1-107:476">I’m concerned he, or rather, the people who succeeded him, would take one look at me, and decide that I am “too woke”, whatever that means. I worry that my existence, that my living in joy, in a state of grace, is “too woke” to be worth employing. I’m certain he wouldn’t be rude to my face, but he might quietly discriminate against me, say no thanks. He might not even think of it as discrimination, only that I don’t have what it takes. Whatever that means.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="109:1-109:70">I think this is why the current turn in the industry is so unsettling.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="111:1-111:635">It’s mean, and unkind. It’s malicious. Moves like Mark’s, and essays like pg’s, create the permission structure for people to discriminate against me. I’ve already been pushed out of Twitter; the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/sep/05/racism-misogyny-lies-how-did-x-become-so-full-of-hatred-and-is-it-ethical-to-keep-using-it">hate speech</a> and <a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/05/24/twitter-considers-cisgender-a-slur-and-moderates-it-over-actual-slurs/">censorship</a> was too much to deal with. A lot of people feel that treating someone like me with respect is just a trendy moral fashion.<sup><a href="http://okayfail.com/2025/i-met-pg-once.html#fn-conventionally-minded" id="fnref-conventionally-minded" data-footnote-ref="">5</a></sup></p>
<p data-sourcepos="115:1-115:164">Will my next promotion be silently denied? Will a coworker try to disrespect me out of spite? Will I be shut out of big tech? Will anyone invest in my next startup?</p>
<p data-sourcepos="117:1-117:117">I’m better at my job than most. I’d be a better startup founder today than I was in 2015. None of that will matter.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="119:1-119:206">It feels as if people like pg, or at least people he hangs out with, who once upon a time believed in me, who lifted me up, recognized my talent, would now prefer that I be relegated to the sex slave caste.</p>
<p data-sourcepos="121:1-121:9">It hurts.</p>

  <h3>
  16 Jan 2025 
  
  
  </h3>

  <p>Oftentimes in your “intro to proofs” class or your first “discrete math” class 
or something similar, you’ll be shown problems of the form “prove that for 
$n^6 + n^3 + 2n^2 + 2n$ is a multiple of $6$ for every $n$”… But where do 
these problems come from? And have you ever stopped to think how magical this 
is? If I gave you some random polynomial in $n$ and asked you if it always 
output multiples of $6$, the answer would almost always be “no”! So if you 
really needed to come up with an example of this phenomenon, how would you do it?
In this blog post, we give one approach!</p>

<p>I want to give some sort of attribution for this, since I remember reading 
about this exact topic… like a <em>long</em> time ago. Maybe 6 or 7 years ago? 
I’m sure that I saved the relevant article<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> 
in my zotero, but I can’t find it for the life 
of me! Regardless, I want to emphasize that the whole idea for this topic 
(using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%B3lya_enumeration_theorem">Pólya-Redfield counting</a> to build these divisibility problems) is not 
mine.</p>

<p>I’ve wanted to write a post on Pólya-Redfield counting for <em>years</em> now, since 
it was a pet topic of mine as an undergrad, but I think I was always planning 
too big a scope. This is a very bite-sized problem, and I won’t go into the 
theory very deeply, so I think it should make for a blog post I can finish in 
a day<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Let’s get to it!</p>

<hr>

<p>Ok, first, how might we come up with problems like this? We want a polynomial 
$P(n)$ and an integer $k$ so that $P(n)$ is always a multiple of $k$. That is, 
so that $P(n) / k$ is always an integer!</p>

<p>But what are sources of integers? If we put our combinatorial hats on, we learn 
that we had better be <em>counting something</em>! That’s the quickest way to 
ensure that we get an integer answer at the end of the day. So we want a 
polynomial so that as we vary $n$, the value $P(n) / k$ counts… something.</p>

<p>At this point, you might be inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnside%27s_lemma#History:_the_lemma_that_is_not_Burnside's">The Lemma Which is Not Burnside’s</a>, 
which says that when a group $G$ acts on a set $X$, the number of orbits is</p><p>

\[\left | X \big / G \right | = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_g |X^g|\]

</p><p>where \(X^g = \{ x \mid gx = x \}\) is the set of fixed points of $g$.</p>

<p>This is great, since in some sense it’s “where division comes from”. I don’t 
want to get into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorification">categorification</a> here, but when we say we’re thinking of 
numbers as the cardinality of some set (to guarantee they’re integers) 
we’re really <em>categorifying</em> our problem. There’s been lots of work showing 
how various operations on numbers lift to categorified operations on 
the category of finite sets, and the only way I know of to categorify division 
is to take the orbits of some group action<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Hopefully this also serves to 
show that categorification doesn’t need to be scary! It can be incredibly 
simple, just thinking about finite sets and what we can do to them…
Though maybe people who read my blog are already convinced of that, haha.</p>

<p>Regardless, this orbit-counting formula is close to what we want! It gives 
us access to division. So if we could only find a family of sets $X_n$, 
all of which admit a $G$-action, then maybe we could have 
$P(n) = \sum_g |X_n^g|$ and thus $P(n)$ will always be divisible by $|G|$, 
since $P(n)/|G|$ counts the orbits $|X_n \big / G|$!</p>

<p>This is exactly what Pólya-Redfield counting buys us! 
I really want to write a blog post with lots of pretty pictures that 
explains this in detail, but maybe just for today I’ll allow myself to be 
a bit less thorough. If you want to see this motivated with pretty pictures, 
I’ll point you to <a href="https://grossack.site/assets/docs/undergrad-divisibility-problems/F23-26-polya-redfield.pdf">some slides</a> by my undergrad advisor Klaus Sutner<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. 
These are from the 2023 version of the class where I first met him back in…
2017? It’s better to not think about that, haha.</p>

<hr>

<p>Moving on, say we have a set $X$ with a $G$-action. Then we think about 
all the ways to “color” $X$ with $n$-many colors. Precisely these are 
functions from \(X \to [n]\), and they pick up a natural $g$ action by sending 
the function $f : X \to [n]$ to the function $(gf)(x) = f(g^{-1}x)$<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. 
These function spaces<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> \((X \to [n])\) will be our sets $X_n$, and all that’s left 
is to see how to compute $|X_n \big / G|$, ideally in a way that’s uniform in 
$n$. Now (a corollary of) the main Pólya-Redfield theorem says:</p>

<div><p>

\[\left | (X \to [n]) \big / G \right | = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_g n^{c(g)}\]

  </p><p>where $c(g)$ is the “cycle count” of $g$. We can view the action of $G$ on $X$ 
as a homomorphism $\alpha$ from $G$ to the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_X$. Then 
$\alpha(g) \in \mathfrak{S}_X$ is a permutation, so decomposes into a product 
of cycles. The number $c(g)$ is perhaps the dumbest invariant you can think of:
just count the number of cycles!</p>
</div>

<p>This is exactly what we want, since it tells us that the polynomial 
$P(n) = \sum_g n^{c(g)}$ is always divisible by $|G|$, since the quotient 
is exactly counting the orbits of the action of $G$ on \((X \to [n])\)!</p>

<p>Again, unfortunately I’ll leave the derivation of this formula 
(and the many many other useful things the Pólya-Redfield theory buys you)
for another day, but at least we can do some quick examples!</p>



<p>First, say we want to count the number of bracelets you can make with $6$ 
beads, provided you have $n$ many types of beads available. Obviously if you 
were looking at bracelets in the real world that you can move around, the
following two bracelets are actually the same:</p>

<p>
<img src="https://grossack.site/assets/images/undergrad-divisibility-problems/off-by-rotation.png" width="50%">
</p>

<p>so we want to count the number of ways to <em>color</em> this picture with $n$ 
colors (this is a choice of bead in each position), but only up to the 
obvious $\mathbb{Z} / 6$ action on the space of colorings<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>!</p>

<p>
<img src="https://grossack.site/assets/images/undergrad-divisibility-problems/configuration.png" width="50%">
</p>

<p>Now choose an isomorphism between the colorable places of our configuration 
and the standard set of size $6$, for instance, this is likely to be 
a common choice:</p>

<p>
<img src="https://grossack.site/assets/images/undergrad-divisibility-problems/configuration-labelled.png" width="50%">
</p>

<p>After making this identification our action is a map 
$\mathbb{Z}/6 \to \mathfrak{S}_6$, and thus we can compute cycle decompositions
as follows:</p>

<div>

  <table>
    <tbody><tr>
        <td>Element $g \in \mathbb{Z}/6$</td>
        <td>Image in $\mathfrak{S}_6$</td>
        <td>Number of Cycles, $c(g)$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>$0$</td>
        <td>$(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)$</td>
        <td>$6$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>$1$</td>
        <td>$(1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 \ 5 \ 6)$</td>
        <td>$1$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>$2$</td>
        <td>$(1 \ 3 \ 5)(2 \ 4 \ 6)$</td>
        <td>$2$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>$3$</td>
        <td>$(1 \ 4)(2 \ 5)(3 \ 6)$</td>
        <td>$3$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>$4$</td>
        <td>$(1 \ 5 \ 3)(2 \ 6 \ 4)$</td>
        <td>$2$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>$5$</td>
        <td>$(1 \ 6 \ 5 \ 4 \ 3 \ 2)$</td>
        <td>$1$</td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

</div>

<p>Using this, we see that the number of bracelets with $n$ beads, up to our 
$\mathbb{Z}/6$ action is</p><p>

\[\frac{1}{|G|} \sum_g n^{c(g)} = 
\frac{1}{6} \left ( n^6 + n^1 + n^2 + n^3 + n^2 + n^1 \right ) =
\frac{1}{6} \left ( n^6 + n^3 + 2n^2 + 2n \right )\]

</p><p>Since this is counting the number of orbits, it must be an integer, and so 
for every $n$, the polynomial $P(n) = n^6 + n^3 + 2n^2 + 2n$ has to be 
divisible by $6$, as promised!</p>



<p>Let’s see a harder one, which (in the interest of speed) I stole from Klaus’s 
lectures:</p>

<p>How many ways can you fill a tic-tac-toe board with $X$s and $O$s, up 
to rotation and reflection?</p>

<p>We have configurations like the following 
(I’ve already chosen a bijection between our colorable places and the 
standard set with $9$ elements):</p>

<p>
<img src="https://grossack.site/assets/images/undergrad-divisibility-problems/tic-tac-toe-configuration.png" width="50%">
</p>

<p>Now we want to color each slot $X$ or $O$, and quotient out the action of 
the dihedral group in order to view the following colorings as “the same”
(of course, these aren’t the whole orbit! There’s many other rotations 
and reflections which are also equivalent):</p>

<p>
<img src="https://grossack.site/assets/images/undergrad-divisibility-problems/rotate-and-reflect.png" width="50%">
</p>

<p>Notice we’re also not worried about which colorings come from actual games 
of tic-tac-toe!</p>

<p>How does Pólya-Redfield tell us to proceed? Well, the dihedral group $D_{2 \cdot 4}$ 
has $8$ elements, built out of rotations and reflections. Say that $r$ is 
the clockwise rotation shown above, and $s$ is the horizontal flip shown above.
Then using the numbering system from before, we compute</p>

<p>
<img src="https://grossack.site/assets/images/undergrad-divisibility-problems/r-and-s.png" width="50%">
</p>

<p>so that, in cycle notation:</p><p>

\[r \mapsto (1 \ 7 \ 9 \ 3) (2 \ 4 \ 8 \ 6)(5)\]

\[s \mapsto (1 \ 3)(4 \ 6)(7 \ 9)(2)(5)(8)\]

</p><p>Since $r$ and $s$ generate the whole dihedral group, we’re done with the 
hard work! Now a computer algebra system like <a href="https://sagemath.org/">sage</a> can compute the 
rest of the table from these by multiplying them together:</p>



<p>As a cute exercise for those new to group theory, try computing 
these 8 permutations yourself! Can you figure out which one comes from 
which element of the dihedral group? Can you see how they relate to the 
usual presentation $G = \langle r, s \mid r^4, s^2, srs=r^{-1} \rangle$?</p>

<p>From here it’s easy to read off the polynomial! If we have $n$-many available 
colors to put in each slot of the tic-tac-toe board, then the number of 
possible boards, counted up to rotation and reflection is given by</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\left | (\mathtt{TicTacToeBoard} \to [n]) \big / G \right | 
&amp;= \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_g n^{c(g)} \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{8} \left ( n^9 + 4n^6 + n^5 + 2n^3 \right )
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Since we’re trying to color the board with only two colors, $X$ and $O$, 
we see the number of ways is</p><p>

\[\frac{1}{8} \left ( 2^9 + 4 \cdot 2^6 + 2^5 + 2 \cdot 2^3 \right )
= 102\]

</p><p>Now we’ve really made two predictions here. First, that 
$P(n) = n^9 + 4n^6 + n^5 + 2n^3$ will be a multiple of $8$ for whichever
$n$ you plug in. Second, that this quotient really <em>is</em> counting the 
tic-tac-toe boards! Let’s take a quick second and ask sage how true those look.</p>

<p>First, we can just plug in a few thousand $n$s and see if we ever hit anything 
other than a multiple of $8$:</p>



<p>Second, we know there’s only $2^9 = 512$ many ways to 2-color a tic-tac-toe 
board without counting rotations and reflections. So it’s not too time 
consuming to just list all of them and remove any we’ve seen before!</p>



<hr>

<p>So there we go! This actually ended up taking two days to write, 
since yesterday I got distracted from my distraction when I was 
talking to a friend about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_(mathematics)">connections</a> and how 
curvature is related to force in physics. I realized I don’t actually 
understand that as well as I thought I did, so I had to spend some 
time rereading a bunch of physics stuff, which was super fun, even if it took 
a while, haha.</p>

<p>If you’re ever on a deserted island and you find yourself needing polynomials 
whose outputs are always divisible by some fixed number, this is an endless 
source! You might ask if <em>every</em> such polynomial arises from Pólya-Redfield 
counting in this way, and that’s obviously false (since, for instance, 
we’ll never get any constant terms)… But it’s <em>not</em> obviously false that 
every such polynomial arises from Pólya-Redfield counting 
<em>after a change of variables</em>! So with no intuition at all for whether 
it’s true or false, let me pose that as a conjecture:</p>

<div>
  <p>Conjecture:</p>

  <p>If $p$ is a polynomial so that $p(n)$ is a multiple of $k$ for every $n$, 
then there is a set $X$ and a group $G$ of order $k$ and a polynomial $f$ 
sending integers to integers so that</p><p>

\[\frac{1}{k}p(n) \text{ counts the orbits } |(X \to [f(n)]) \big / G|\]

  </p><p>Maybe $f$ can even be taken to be of the form $an+b$, why not. I haven’t 
thought about it either way, haha.</p>
</div>

<p>For anyone interested in thinking about this conjecture, it’ll be nice 
to know that every polynomial sending integers to integers is an integer 
linear combination of binomial coefficients (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer-valued_polynomial#Classification">here</a>). Amusingly, 
this was also shown by Pólya!</p>

<p>You can push this further (as mentioned in the same wikipedia article) to 
note that $k \mid p(n)$ for all $n$ if and only if in the above 
representation $p = \sum c_i \binom{x}{i}$, all the $c_i$s are multiples of $k$.
So we have an extremely concrete classification of these polynomials, which 
one might use to (dis)prove the conjecture<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>!</p>

<p>As a cute aside, we’ve actually talked about this basis for polynomials in 
terms of binomial coefficients <a href="https://grossack.site/2021/05/13/stirling-basis-change">before</a>! Seeing them turn up here was 
like seeing an old friend.</p>



<p>Thanks again for hanging out, all! This was super fun, and it was a nice 
diversion from the blog post about my thesis work. It’s loooong, but really 
interesting, and I think people will enjoy it. This stuff relating 
fukaya categories, topological field theories, and representation theory 
is some of the coolest math I’ve ever seen, and I couldn’t have asked for a 
more fun thesis topic.</p>

<p>Of course, I also need to get the <a href="https://grossack.site/2024/07/03/life-in-johnstones-topological-topos">topological topos posts</a> cleaned up 
and submitted to journals, and I have a fun project that I want to 
finish up which will be interesting to categorical logicians and 
algebraic geometers! (At least, algebraic geometers of a certain kind, haha).
There’s always more to do, but that’s part of the fun of it! After two months 
applying to postdocs and barely doing any math at all, I’m thrilled to be 
back at it ^_^.</p>

<p>Alright, stay safe, all! We’ll talk soon 💖</p>

<h2 id="notation" tabindex="-1">Notation&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>For showing inferred types in the source code, I use the npm package <a href="https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-expect"><code>ts-expect</code></a> – e.g.:</p>
<pre><code><span>// Types of values</span>
expectType&lt;<span>string</span>&gt;(<span>'abc'</span>);
expectType&lt;<span>number</span>&gt;(<span>123</span>);

<span>// Equality of types</span>
<span>type</span> <span>Pair</span>&lt;T&gt; = [T, T];
expectType&lt;<span>TypeEqual</span>&lt;<span>Pair</span>&lt;<span>string</span>&gt;, [<span>string</span>,<span>string</span>]&gt;&gt;(<span>true</span>);
</code></pre>
<h2 id="the-basics-of-typescript-enums" tabindex="-1">The basics of TypeScript enums&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>There are many different kinds of <em>enums</em> in various programming languages. In TypeScript, an enum defines two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>an object that maps member keys to member values</li>
<li>a type that only contains the member values</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that we are ignoring <a href="https://exploringjs.com/tackling-ts/ch_enums.html#const-enums">const enums</a> in this blog post.</p>
<p>Next, we’ll look at various aspects of enums in more detail.</p>
<h3 id="an-enum-defines-an-object" tabindex="-1">An enum defines an object&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>On one hand, an enum is an object that maps member keys to member values. In that way, it works much like an object literal:</p>
<pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>Color</span> {
  <span>Red</span> = <span>0</span>,
  <span>Green</span> = <span>'GREEN'</span>,
}
assert.<span>equal</span>(<span>Color</span>.<span>Red</span>, <span>0</span>);
assert.<span>equal</span>(<span>Color</span>.<span>Green</span>, <span>'GREEN'</span>);
assert.<span>equal</span>(<span>Color</span>[<span>'Green'</span>], <span>'GREEN'</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>One limitation is that only numbers and strings are allowed as member values.</p>
<h3 id="an-enum-defines-a-type" tabindex="-1">An enum defines a type&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>On the other hand, an enum is also a type that only contains the member values:</p>
<pre><code><span>let</span> <span>color</span>: <span>Color</span>;
color = <span>Color</span>.<span>Red</span>;
color = <span>Color</span>.<span>Green</span>;
<span>// @ts-expect-error: Type 'true' is not assignable to type 'Color'.</span>
color = <span>true</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>There is one important difference between string members and number members: We cannot assign plain strings to <code>color</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>// @ts-expect-error: Type '"GREEN"' is not assignable to</span>
<span>// type 'Color'.</span>
color = <span>'GREEN'</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>But we can assign a plain number to <code>color</code> – if it is the value of a member:</p>
<pre><code>color = <span>0</span>;
<span>// @ts-expect-error: Type '123' is not assignable to type 'Color'.</span>
color = <span>123</span>;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="we-can-check-exhaustiveness-for-enums" tabindex="-1">We can check exhaustiveness for enums&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Consider the following enum:</p>
<pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>Color</span> {
  <span>Red</span> = <span>0</span>,
  <span>Green</span> = <span>'GREEN'</span>,
}
</code></pre>
<p>If we handle the values that a variable of type <code>Color</code> may have, then TypeScript can warn us if we forget one of them. In other words: If we didn’t handle all cases “exhaustively”. That is called an <em>exhaustiveness check</em>. To see how that works, let’s start with the following code:</p>
<pre><code><span>// @ts-expect-error: Not all code paths return a value.</span>
<span>function</span> <span>colorToString</span>(<span>color: Color</span>) {
  expectType&lt;<span>Color</span>&gt;(color); <span>// (A)</span>
  <span>if</span> (color === <span>Color</span>.<span>Red</span>) {
    <span>return</span> <span>'red'</span>;
  }
  expectType&lt;<span>Color</span>.<span>Green</span>&gt;(color); <span>// (B)</span>
  <span>if</span> (color === <span>Color</span>.<span>Green</span>) {
    <span>return</span> <span>'green'</span>;
  }
  expectType&lt;<span>never</span>&gt;(color); <span>// (C)</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>In line A, <code>color</code> can still have any value. In line B, we have crossed off <code>Color.Red</code> and <code>color</code> can only have the value <code>Color.Green</code>. In line C, <code>color</code> can’t have any value – which explains its type <code>never</code>.</p>
<p>If <code>color</code> is <em>not</em> <code>never</code> in line C then we have forgotten a member. We can let TypeScript report an error at compile time like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>function</span> <span>colorToString</span>(<span>color: Color</span>) {
  <span>if</span> (color === <span>Color</span>.<span>Red</span>) {
    <span>return</span> <span>'red'</span>;
  }
  <span>if</span> (color === <span>Color</span>.<span>Green</span>) {
    <span>return</span> <span>'green'</span>;
  }
  <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>UnsupportedValueError</span>(color);
}
</code></pre>
<p>How does that work? The <code>value</code> we pass to <code>UnsupportedValueError</code> must have the type <code>never</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>UnsupportedValueError</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Error</span> {
  <span>constructor</span>(<span>value: <span>never</span>, message = <span>`Unsupported value: <span>${value}</span>`</span></span>) {
    <span>super</span>(message)
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is what happens if we forget the second case:</p>
<pre><code><span>function</span> <span>colorToString</span>(<span>color: Color</span>) {
  <span>if</span> (color === <span>Color</span>.<span>Red</span>) {
    <span>return</span> <span>'red'</span>;
  }
  <span>// @ts-expect-error: Argument of type 'Color.Green'</span>
  <span>// is not assignable to parameter of type 'never'.</span>
  <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>UnsupportedValueError</span>(color);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Exhaustiveness checking works just as well with <code>case</code> statements:</p>
<pre><code><span>function</span> <span>colorToString</span>(<span>color: Color</span>) {
  <span>switch</span> (color) {
    <span>case</span> <span>Color</span>.<span>Red</span>:
      <span>return</span> <span>'red'</span>;
    <span>case</span> <span>Color</span>.<span>Green</span>:
      <span>return</span> <span>'green'</span>;
    <span>default</span>:
      <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>UnsupportedValueError</span>(color);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Another way to check exhaustiveness is by specifying a return type for the function:</p>
<pre><code><span>// @ts-expect-error: Function lacks ending return statement and</span>
<span>// return type does not include 'undefined'.</span>
<span>function</span> <span>colorToString</span>(<span>color: Color</span>): <span>string</span> {
  <span>switch</span> (color) {
    <span>case</span> <span>Color</span>.<span>Red</span>:
      <span>return</span> <span>'red'</span>;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In my code, I usually do that but additionally throw an <code>UnsupportedValueError</code> because I like having a check that also works at runtime.</p>
<h3 id="enumerating-members" tabindex="-1">Enumerating members&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>One operation that is occasionally useful is enumerating the members of an enum. Can we do that with TypeScript enums? Let’s use our previous enum:</p>
<pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>Color</span> {
  <span>Red</span> = <span>0</span>,
  <span>Green</span> = <span>'GREEN'</span>,
}
</code></pre>
<p>Compiled to JavaScript, <code>Color</code> looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>var</span> <span>Color</span>;
(<span>function</span> (<span>Color</span>) {
    <span>Color</span>[<span>Color</span>[<span>"Red"</span>] = <span>0</span>] = <span>"Red"</span>; <span>// (A)</span>
    <span>Color</span>[<span>"Green"</span>] = <span>"GREEN"</span>; <span>// (B)</span>
})(<span>Color</span> || (<span>Color</span> = {}));
</code></pre>
<p>This is a function that is immediately invoked and adds properties to an object <code>Color</code>.</p>
<p>The code for the string member <code>Green</code> in line B is straightforward: It maps from key to value.</p>
<p>The code for the number member <code>Red</code> in line A adds two properties for <code>Red</code> instead of one – a mapping from key to value and a mapping from value to key:</p>
<pre><code><span>Color</span>[<span>"Red"</span>] = <span>0</span>;
<span>Color</span>[<span>0</span>] = <span>"Red"</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the zero in the second line is coerced to a string (a property key can only be a string or a symbol). Thus, we can’t even really look up a number this way. We have to convert it to a string first.</p>
<p>Therefore, the number member prevents us from enumerating the keys or values of this enum:</p>
<pre><code>assert.<span>deepEqual</span>(
  <span>Object</span>.<span>keys</span>(<span>Color</span>), [<span>'0'</span>, <span>'Red'</span>, <span>'Green'</span>]
);
assert.<span>deepEqual</span>(
  <span>Object</span>.<span>values</span>(<span>Color</span>), [<span>'Red'</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>'GREEN'</span>]
);
</code></pre>
<p>If we switch to only string members then enumeration works:</p>
<pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>Color</span> {
  <span>Red</span> = <span>'RED'</span>,
  <span>Green</span> = <span>'GREEN'</span>,

<h3 id="enums-without-explicitly-specified-values" tabindex="-1">Enums without explicitly specified values&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>We can also create enums without explicitly specifying member values. Then TypeScript specifies them for us and uses numbers:</p>
<pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>Color</span> {
  <span>Red</span>, <span>// implicitly = 0</span>
  <span>Green</span>, <span>// implicitly = 1</span>

<h2 id="use-cases-for-enums" tabindex="-1">Use cases for enums&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Making sense of enums and enum-related patterns can quickly get confusing because what an enum is varies widely between programming languages – e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>Java’s enums are classes with a fixed set of instances.</li>
<li>Rust’s enums are more like algebraic datatypes in functional programming languages. They are loosely related to <a href="https://exploringjs.com/tackling-ts/ch_enum-alternatives.html#discriminated-union">discriminated unions</a> in TypeScript.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, we benefit from a narrow definition of the term <em>enum</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fixed set of values.</li>
<li>That can be accessed via the keys of an object.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following sections, we’ll go through the following use cases for this kind of enum:</p>
<ol>
<li>Namespace for constants with primitive values</li>
<li>Custom type with unique values</li>
<li>Namespace for constants with object values</li>
</ol>
<p>We’ll consider how well TypeScript enums work for these use cases. (Spoiler: they work reasonably well for #1 and #2 but can’t be used for #3.) And we’ll look at enum-like patterns that we can use instead.</p>
<p>For each option, we’ll also examine:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can exhaustiveness checks be performed?</li>
<li>Can members be enumerated?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="use-case%3A-namespace-for-constants-with-primitive-values" tabindex="-1">Use case: namespace for constants with primitive values&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>One way in which enums (or enum-like objects) are sometimes used is simply as a namespace for constants – e.g., the Node.js function <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fsaccesspath-mode-callback"><code>fs.access()</code></a> has a parameter <code>mode</code> whose values are provided via an object that is similar to the following enum:</p>
<pre><code><span>enum</span> constants {
  <span>F_OK</span> = <span>0</span>,
  <span>R_OK</span> = <span>4</span>,
  <span>W_OK</span> = <span>2</span>,
  <span>X_OK</span> = <span>1</span>,
  <span>// ...</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>Except for the first value, these are bits that are combined via bitwise Or:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> readOrWrite = constants.<span>R_OK</span> | constants.<span>W_OK</span>;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="enum-as-namespace-for-constants-with-primitive-values" tabindex="-1">Enum as namespace for constants with primitive values&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Which enum features are relevant for this use case?</p>
<ul>
<li>One major limitation of enums is that values can only be number or strings.</li>
<li>The enum as a type doesn’t matter: The type of parameter <code>mode</code> is <code>number</code>, not <code>constants</code> or something similar. That’s because the values of <code>constants</code> are not an exhaustive list of all possible values of <code>mode</code>.</li>
<li>For the same reason, exhaustiveness checks are not relevant in this case.</li>
<li>Enumerating members isn’t desirable either. And it’s not something that we can do with number-valued enums anyway.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="alternative-to-enum%3A-object-literal" tabindex="-1">Alternative to enum: object literal&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>For this use case, an object literal is a very good alternative:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> constants = {
  <span>__proto__</span>: <span>null</span>,
  <span>F_OK</span>: <span>0</span>,
  <span>R_OK</span>: <span>4</span>,
  <span>W_OK</span>: <span>2</span>,
  <span>X_OK</span>: <span>1</span>,
};
</code></pre>
<p>We use the pseudo property key <code>__proto__</code> to set the prototype of <code>constants</code> to <code>null</code>. That is a good practice because then we don’t have to deal with inherited properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>The main benefit is that we can use the <code>in</code> operator to check if <code>constants</code> has a given key without worrying about properties inherited from <code>Object.prototype</code> such as <code>.toString</code>.</li>
<li>However, <code>Object.keys()</code> and <code>Object.values()</code> ignore inherited properties anyway, so we don’t gain anything there.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that <code>__proto__</code> also exists as a getter and a setter in <code>Object.prototype</code>. This feature is deprecated in favor of <code>Object.getPrototypeOf()</code> and <code>Object.setPrototypeOf()</code>. However, that is different from using this name in an object literal – which is not deprecated.</p>

<h2 id="use-case%3A-custom-type-with-unique-values" tabindex="-1">Use case: custom type with unique values&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Sometimes we may want to define our own custom type that has a fixed set of values. For example, booleans don’t always express intentions well. Then an enum can do a better job:</p>
<pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>Activation</span> {
  <span>Active</span> = <span>'Active'</span>,
  <span>Inactive</span> = <span>'Inactive'</span>,
}
</code></pre>
<p>It’s a good practice to explicitly specify string values via <code>=</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>We get more type safety and can’t accidentally provide numbers where an <code>Activation</code> is expected.</li>
<li>We can enumerate the keys and values of <code>Activation</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="enum-as-custom-type-with-unique-values" tabindex="-1">Enum as custom type with unique values&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Which enum features are relevant for this use case?</p>
<ul>
<li>We will use the type defined by <code>Activation</code>.</li>
<li>Exhaustiveness checks are possible and useful.</li>
<li>We also may want to enumerate keys or values.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="alternative-to-enum%3A-object-literal-1" tabindex="-1">Alternative to enum: object literal&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Let’s use an object literal to define the value part of an enum (we’ll get to the type part next):</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> <span>Activation</span> = {
  <span>__proto__</span>: <span>null</span>,
  <span>Active</span>: <span>'Active'</span>,
  <span>Inactive</span>: <span>'Inactive'</span>,
} <span>as</span> <span>const</span>; <span>// (A)</span>

<span>// Without `as const`, this type would be `string`:</span>
expectType&lt;<span>'Active'</span>&gt;(<span>Activation</span>.<span>Active</span>);

<span>type</span> <span>ActivationType</span> = <span>PropertyValues</span>&lt;<span>typeof</span> <span>Activation</span>&gt;;
expectType&lt;
  <span>TypeEqual</span>&lt;<span>ActivationType</span>, <span>'Active'</span> | <span>'Inactive'</span>&gt;
&gt;(<span>true</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>as const</code> in line A enables us to derive <code>ActivationType</code> from <code>Activation</code> via the helper type <code>PropertyValues</code> (which is defined below).</p>
<p>Why is this type called <code>ActivationType</code> and not <code>Activation</code>? Since the namespaces of values and types are separate in TypeScript, we could indeed use the same name. However, I’ve had issues when using Visual Studio Code to rename value and type: It got confused because importing <code>Activation</code> imported both value and type. That’s why I’m using different names – for now.</p>
<p>The helper type <code>PropertyValues</code> looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> <span>PropertyValues</span>&lt;<span>Obj</span>&gt; = <span>Obj</span>[<span>Exclude</span>&lt;keyof <span>Obj</span>, <span>'__proto__'</span>&gt;];
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The type <code>Obj[K]</code> contains the values of all properties whose keys are in <code>K</code>.</li>
<li>We exclude the key <code>'__proto__'</code> from <code>keyof Obj</code> because TypeScript treats that key as a normal property and that’s not what we want (<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/38385">related GitHub issue</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s explore what the derived type looks like if we don’t use <code>as const</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> <span>Activation</span> = {
  <span>__proto__</span>: <span>null</span>,
  <span>Active</span>: <span>'Active'</span>,
  <span>Inactive</span>: <span>'Inactive'</span>,
};

expectType&lt;<span>string</span>&gt;(<span>Activation</span>.<span>Active</span>);
expectType&lt;<span>string</span>&gt;(<span>Activation</span>.<span>Inactive</span>);

<span>type</span> <span>ActivationType</span> = <span>PropertyValues</span>&lt;<span>typeof</span> <span>Activation</span>&gt;;
expectType&lt;
  <span>TypeEqual</span>&lt;<span>ActivationType</span>, <span>string</span>&gt;
&gt;(<span>true</span>);
</code></pre>
<h4 id="exhaustiveness-checks" tabindex="-1">Exhaustiveness checks&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<p>TypeScript supports exhaustiveness checks for unions of literal types. And that’s what <code>ActivationType</code> is. Therefore, we can use the same pattern as we did with enums:</p>
<pre><code><span>function</span> <span>activationToString</span>(<span>activation: ActivationType</span>): <span>string</span> {
  <span>switch</span> (activation) {
    <span>case</span> <span>Activation</span>.<span>Active</span>:
      <span>return</span> <span>'ACTIVE'</span>;
    <span>case</span> <span>Activation</span>.<span>Inactive</span>:
      <span>return</span> <span>'INACTIVE'</span>;
    <span>default</span>:
      <span>throw</span> <span>new</span> <span>UnsupportedValueError</span>(activation);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h4 id="enumerating-members-1" tabindex="-1">Enumerating members&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<p>We can use <code>Object.keys()</code> and <code>Object.values()</code> to enumerate the members of the object <code>Activation</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>for</span> (<span>const</span> value <span>of</span> <span>Object</span>.<span>values</span>(<span>Activation</span>)) {
  <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(value);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Active
Inactive
</code></pre>
<h4 id="using-symbols-as-property-values" tabindex="-1">Using symbols as property values&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<p>One downside of using strings as property values is that <code>ActivationType</code> does not exclude arbitrary strings from being used. We can get more type safety if we use symbols:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> <span>Active</span> = <span>Symbol</span>(<span>'Active'</span>);
<span>const</span> <span>Inactive</span> = <span>Symbol</span>(<span>'Inactive'</span>);

<span>const</span> <span>Activation</span> = {
  <span>__proto__</span>: <span>null</span>,
  <span>Active</span>,
  <span>Inactive</span>,
} <span>as</span> <span>const</span>;

expectType&lt;<span>typeof</span> <span>Active</span>&gt;(<span>Activation</span>.<span>Active</span>);

<span>type</span> <span>ActivationType</span> = <span>PropertyValues</span>&lt;<span>typeof</span> <span>Activation</span>&gt;;

    <span>ActivationType</span>, <span>typeof</span> <span>Active</span> | <span>typeof</span> <span>Inactive</span>
  &gt;
&gt;(<span>true</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>This seems overly complicated: Why the intermediate step of first declaring variables for the symbols before we use them? Why not create the symbols inside the object literal? Alas, that’s a current limitation of <code>as const</code> for symbols: They are not recognized as unique (<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/54100">related GitHub issue</a>):</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> <span>Activation</span> = {
  <span>__proto__</span>: <span>null</span>,
  <span>Active</span>: <span>Symbol</span>(<span>'Active'</span>),
  <span>Inactive</span>: <span>Symbol</span>(<span>'Inactive'</span>),
} <span>as</span> <span>const</span>;

<span>// Alas, the type of Activation.Active is not `typeof Active`</span>
expectType&lt;<span>symbol</span>&gt;(<span>Activation</span>.<span>Active</span>);

<h3 id="alternative-to-enum%3A-union-of-string-literal-types" tabindex="-1">Alternative to enum: union of string literal types&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>A union of string literal types is an interesting alternative to an enum when it comes to defining a type with a fixed set of members:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> <span>Activation</span> = <span>'Active'</span> | <span>'Inactive'</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>How does such a type compare to an enum?</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s a quick and simple solution.</li>
<li>It supports exhaustiveness checks.</li>
<li>Renaming members works reasonably well in Visual Studio Code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The type members are not unique. We could change that by using symbols but then we’d lose some of the convenience of string literal union types – e.g., we’d have to import the values.</li>
<li>We can’t enumerate the members. The next section explains how to change that.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="reifying-string-literal-unions" tabindex="-1">Reifying string literal unions via Sets&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<p><em>Reification</em> means creating an entity at the object level (think JavaScript values) for an entity that exists at the meta level (think TypeScript types).</p>
<p>We can use a Set to reify a string literal union type:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> activation = <span>new</span> <span>Set</span>([
  <span>'Active'</span>,
  <span>'Inactive'</span>,
] <span>as</span> <span>const</span>);
expectType&lt;<span>Set</span>&lt;<span>'Active'</span> | <span>'Inactive'</span>&gt;&gt;(activation);

<span>// @ts-expect-error: Argument of type '"abc"' is not assignable to</span>
<span>// parameter of type '"Active" | "Inactive"'.</span>
activation.<span>has</span>(<span>'abc'</span>);
  <span>// Auto-completion works for arguments of .has(), .delete() etc.</span>

<span>// Let’s turn the Set into a string literal union</span>
<span>type</span> <span>Activation</span> = <span>SetElementType</span>&lt;<span>typeof</span> activation&gt;;
expectType&lt;
  <span>TypeEqual</span>&lt;<span>Activation</span>, <span>'Active'</span> | <span>'Inactive'</span>&gt;

</code></pre>
<h4 id="exhaustiveness-check" tabindex="-1">Exhaustiveness check&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Why do the property values of <code>TextStyle</code> have the property <code>.key</code>? That property lets us do exhaustiveness checks because the property values form a <a href="https://exploringjs.com/tackling-ts/ch_enum-alternatives.html#discriminated-union">discriminated union</a>.</p>
<pre><code><span>function</span> <span>f</span>(<span>textStyle: TextStyleType</span>): <span>string</span> {

  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="enum-class" tabindex="-1">Enum class&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>We can also use a class as an enum – a pattern that is borrowed from Java:</p>

&gt;(<span>true</span>);

<span>type</span> <span>EnumKeys</span>&lt;T&gt; = <span>Exclude</span>&lt;keyof T, <span>'prototype'</span>&gt;;
</code></pre>
<p>One pro of this pattern is that we can use methods to add behavior to the enum values. A con is that there is no simple way to get an exhaustiveness check.</p>
<p><code>Object.keys()</code> and <code>Object.values()</code> ignore non-enumerable properties of <code>TextStyle</code> such as <code>.prototype</code> – which is why we can use them to enumerate keys and values – e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>assert.<span>deepEqual</span>(
  <span>// TextStyle.prototype is non-enumerable</span>
  <span>Object</span>.<span>keys</span>(<span>TextStyle</span>),
  [<span>'Bold'</span>, <span>'Italics'</span>]
);
</code></pre>
<h2 id="mapping-to-and-from-an-enum" tabindex="-1">Mapping to and from an enum&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Sometimes we want to translate enum values to other values or vice versa – e.g. when serializing them to JSON or deserializing them from JSON. If we do so via a <code>Map</code>, we can use TypeScript to get a warning if we forget an enum value.</p>
<p>To explore how that works, we’ll use the following enum pattern type:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> <span>Pending</span> = <span>Symbol</span>(<span>'Pending'</span>);
<span>const</span> <span>Ongoing</span> = <span>Symbol</span>(<span>'Ongoing'</span>);
<span>const</span> <span>Finished</span> = <span>Symbol</span>(<span>'Finished'</span>);
<span>const</span> <span>TaskStatus</span> = {
  <span>__proto__</span>: <span>null</span>,
  <span>Pending</span>,
  <span>Ongoing</span>,
  <span>Finished</span>,
} <span>as</span> <span>const</span>;
<span>type</span> <span>TaskStatusType</span> = <span>PropertyValues</span>&lt;<span>typeof</span> <span>TaskStatus</span>&gt;;
<span>type</span> <span>PropertyValues</span>&lt;<span>Obj</span>&gt; = <span>Obj</span>[<span>Exclude</span>&lt;keyof <span>Obj</span>, <span>'__proto__'</span>&gt;];
</code></pre>
<p>This is the Map:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> taskPairs = [
  [<span>TaskStatus</span>.<span>Pending</span>, <span>'not yet'</span>],
  [<span>TaskStatus</span>.<span>Ongoing</span>, <span>'working on it'</span>],
  [<span>TaskStatus</span>.<span>Finished</span>, <span>'finished'</span>],
] <span>as</span> <span>const</span>;

<span>type</span> <span>Key</span> = (<span>typeof</span> taskPairs)[<span>number</span>][<span>0</span>];
<span>const</span> taskMap = <span>new</span> <span>Map</span>&lt;<span>Key</span>, <span>string</span>&gt;(taskPairs);
</code></pre>
<p>If you are wondering why we didn’t directly use the value of <code>taskPairs</code> as the argument of <code>new Map()</code> and omit the type parameters: TypeScript doesn’t seem to be able to infer the type parameters if the keys are symbols and reports a compile-time error. With strings, the code would be simpler:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> taskPairs = [
  [<span>'Pending'</span>, <span>'not yet'</span>],
  [<span>'Ongoing'</span>, <span>'working on it'</span>],
  [<span>'Finished'</span>, <span>'finished'</span>],
] <span>as</span> <span>const</span>;
<span>const</span> taskMap = <span>new</span> <span>Map</span>(taskPairs); <span>// no type parameters!</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The final step is to check if we forgot only of the values of <code>TaskStatus</code>:</p>
<pre><code>expectType&lt;
  <span>TypeEqual</span>&lt;<span>MapKey</span>&lt;<span>typeof</span> taskMap&gt;, <span>TaskStatusType</span>&gt;
&gt;(<span>true</span>);
<span>type</span> <span>MapKey</span>&lt;M <span>extends</span> <span>Map</span>&lt;<span>any</span>, <span>any</span>&gt;&gt; =
  M <span>extends</span> <span>Map</span>&lt;infer K, <span>any</span>&gt; ? K : <span>never</span>;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="recommendations" tabindex="-1">Recommendations&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>When should we use an enum and when an alternative pattern?</p>
<p><strong>TypeScript enums are not JavaScript:</strong> Enums are one of the few TypeScript language constructs (vs. type constructs) that have no corresponding JavaScript features. That can matter in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The transpiled code looks a bit strange – especially if some enum members are numbers.</li>
<li>If a tool doesn’t transpile TypeScript but only strips types then it won’t support enums. That’s not (yet?) that common but one prominent example is <a href="https://2ality.com/2025/01/nodejs-strip-type.html">Node’s current built-in support for TypeScript</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Performance of strings:</strong> One thing to keep in mind is that comparing strings is usually slower than comparing numbers or symbols. Therefore, enums or enum patterns where values are strings, are slower. Note that applies to string literal unions too. But such a performance cost only matters if we do many comparisons.</p>
<p><strong>What is the use case?</strong> Looking at the use cases can help us make a decision:</p>
<ol>
<li>Namespace for constants with primitive values:
<ul>
<li>If the primitive values are numbers or strings, we can use a TypeScript enum.
<ul>
<li>Alas, number values aren’t great because each member produces two properties: a mapping from key to value and a reverse mapping.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Otherwise (or if we don’t want to use an enum) we can use an object literal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Custom type with unique values:
<ul>
<li>If we use an enum, it should have string values because that gives us more type safety and lets us iterate over keys and values.</li>
<li>A union of string literal types is a lightweight, quick solution. Its downsides are: less type safety and no namespace object for easy lookup.
<ul>
<li>If we want to access the string literal values at runtime, we can use a Set to reify them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If we want a solid, slightly verbose solution, we can use an object literal with symbol property values.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Namespace for constants with object values:
<ul>
<li>We can’t use enums for this use case.</li>
<li>We can use an object literal whose property values are objects. The upside of this solution is that we can check exhaustiveness.</li>
<li>If we want enum values to have methods, we can use an enum class. However that means that we can’t check exhaustiveness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
