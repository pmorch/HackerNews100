<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It turns out, <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/big-gpus-dont-need-big-pcs/">you can attach an external GPU to a Raspberry Pi 5</a>. So my natural first question is, can I game on it? Let’s try it out and compare it with some similar computers.</p><p>For the showdown of crappy gaming computers, we’ll see which of these handles gaming best:</p><h3 id="beelink-mini-s13"><a href="https://amzn.to/4qh5EOe">Beelink MINI-S13</a></h3><ul><li><strong>CPU:</strong> 4-core Intel N150 @ 3.6GHz</li><li><strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB DDR4</li><li><strong>PCIe:</strong> M.2 Gen3 x4</li></ul><p><img src="https://scottjg.com/posts/2026-01-08-crappy-computer-showdown/beelink-top.jpg" alt="beelink-top.jpg"><img src="https://scottjg.com/posts/2026-01-08-crappy-computer-showdown/beelink-bottom.jpg" alt="beelink-bottom.jpg"></p><p>More powerful than the Raspberry Pi 5, but at a similar price point. It also has a potential advantage for running games, since it’s not ARM-based.</p><p>In the photo, you can see the default configuration (SSD in the fast PCIe slot). For this experiment, I’ll move it into the slower (x1) slot and plug the eGPU into the faster (x4) slot.</p><h3 id="radxa-rock-5b"><a href="https://amzn.to/4qf4uCU">Radxa ROCK 5B</a></h3><ul><li><strong>CPU:</strong> 8-core RK3588 (4× Cortex-A76 @ 2.4GHz + 4× Cortex-A55 @ 1.8GHz)</li><li><strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB DDR4</li><li><strong>PCIe:</strong> M.2 Gen3 x4</li><li><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://amzn.to/4qwrXjf">Aftermarket heat sink &amp; fan combo</a></li></ul><p><img src="https://scottjg.com/posts/2026-01-08-crappy-computer-showdown/rock5b-top.jpg" alt="rock5b-top.jpg"><img src="https://scottjg.com/posts/2026-01-08-crappy-computer-showdown/rock5b-bottom.jpg" alt="rock5b-bottom.jpg"></p><p>Pretty comparable to the Raspberry Pi 5 (it’s ARM), but the extra cores give it a little more horsepower. The faster PCIe slot is also included on-board. Since the PCIe slot will be taken for the GPU, we’ll just use a <a href="https://amzn.to/4pzyybl">USB SSD</a> for both ARM boards.</p><h3 id="raspberry-pi-5"><a href="https://amzn.to/4jxuw1r">Raspberry Pi 5</a></h3><ul><li><strong>CPU:</strong> 4-core BCM2712 (Cortex-A76 @ 2.4GHz)</li><li><strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB DDR4</li><li><strong>PCIe:</strong> M.2 Gen2 x1 (via <a href="https://amzn.to/49vdJb2">NVme HAT</a>)</li><li><strong>Also:</strong> <a href="https://amzn.to/4sCeFmI">Aftermarket heat sink &amp; fan combo</a></li></ul><p><img src="https://scottjg.com/posts/2026-01-08-crappy-computer-showdown/rpi5-top.jpg" alt="rpi5-top.jpg"><img src="https://scottjg.com/posts/2026-01-08-crappy-computer-showdown/rpi5-bottom.jpg" alt="rpi5-bottom.jpg"></p><p>This is why we’re all here. It’s the quintessential hobbyist SBC. Unfortunately it’s the most challenged: fewer cores, and significantly less PCIe bandwidth. The Pi 5’s Gen2 x1 slot provides ~500 MB/s, compared to ~4,000 MB/s on the Gen3 x4 slots of the other machines, an 8x difference.</p><h3 id="egpu">eGPU</h3><p>We will be using a relatively inexpensive <a href="https://amzn.to/3LuqWIV">OCuLink dock</a> to pair with our very expensive GPU. If you’re not familiar with the technology, it’s basically a PCIe extension cord to let you plug a graphics card into a computer that wouldn’t normally fit one. The dock is powered externally by a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/quiet-Certification-semi-Passive-Technology-Overclocked/dp/B0FBX9VS3B?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=scottjg-20&amp;linkId=7741030a2c13875241c115fadf12ab8e&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">separate power supply</a>.</p><p>For this experiment, we’re using an NVIDIA RTX 5090 Founders Edition (32GB VRAM).</p><p><img alt="OCuLink eGPU dock" loading="lazy" src="https://scottjg.com/posts/2026-01-08-crappy-computer-showdown/egpu-oculink.jpg"></p><p>The OCuLink cable plugs into an M.2 card that we’ll insert into each machine as we test it.</p><p>On the Intel-based Beelink machine, from a software perspective the card is more or less indistinguishable from a normal graphics card. We can just install the normal NVIDIA drivers.</p><p>The ARM-based computers we’re testing have various quirks (lack of DMA coherence, memory alignment requirements, etc.) that make them incompatible with most GPU drivers out of the box. Luckily, <a href="https://github.com/mariobalanica">@mariobalanca</a> wrote some patches that allow the drivers to work on these systems. NVIDIA already had some workarounds in the user-space part of their drivers for Ampere-based systems for memory alignment issues, so some of that gets inherited here.</p><p>I have packaged the drivers you can run on Ubuntu or Fedora <a href="https://github.com/scottjg/nvidia-armsbc">here</a>, if you’d like to try this yourself.</p><p>If you’ve gotten this far and simply don’t believe this actually works, here’s a screenshot:
<img alt="Raspberry Pi 5 GPU screenshot" loading="lazy" src="https://scottjg.com/posts/2026-01-08-crappy-computer-showdown/pi5-gpu-screenshot.jpg"></p><h2 id="cpu-performance">CPU Performance</h2><p>Before we get into the games, let’s take a look at how these machines compare.</p><p>Most PC games are designed for Intel CPUs. If we want to play them on ARM we’ll have to use a compatibility layer called FEX. The graph shows not only the native performance of the machines, but also the significantly degraded performance under FEX. To be fair, FEX is an incredible feat of engineering, but all emulation comes at a cost.</p><p>The Raspberry Pi 5 under FEX seems to have similar performance to a 2008 Intel Core 2 Quad Q9650. Not very promising. That said, gamers usually say that, for most games, it’s OK to skimp on CPU a bit as long as you have a good GPU. We will definitely be testing that line of thinking.</p><h2 id="games">Games</h2><p>I tried to find games that had built-in benchmarks that also worked under FEX, along with Steam’s Proton compatibility layer, tilting towards games that didn’t have as strong CPU requirements. It turns out this is actually not a huge list. Here are a handful that I tried:</p><h3 id="cyberpunk-2077-2020">Cyberpunk 2077 (2020)</h3><p><img alt="Screenshot of Cyberpunk 2077 running on the Raspberry Pi" loading="lazy" src="https://scottjg.com/posts/2026-01-08-crappy-computer-showdown/cyberpunk-rpi5-ultra.jpg"></p><p>Yes, believe it or not, <code>vkcube</code> is not the only thing you can run in this configuration. Through the maze of compatibility layers (FEX, WINE/Proton, DXVK, etc), you too can run Cyberpunk 2077 on your Raspberry Pi 5. The screenshot above is running at 1080p with Ultra Raytracing quality settings.</p><p>The game is playable on the Beelink machine with some lower settings. Since it’s an Intel machine, I also tested the game on Windows for posterity. Usually it’s suggested that even with all the compatibility layers, Linux gaming can be faster, but not in this case on the lower settings here.</p><p>These games really get CPU bound, caught up on these lower-spec CPUs. I think on a normal gaming PC, it wouldn’t matter as much, but every cycle starts to count here, and not all the abstractions provided by WINE are zero cost.</p><p>Unfortunately the Pi barely breaks 15 FPS, but on the ROCK 5B, it approaches playable on low settings. Granted, not sure how fun that would be at 22 FPS.</p><h3 id="doom-the-dark-ages-2025">Doom: The Dark Ages (2025)</h3><p>This game doesn’t run under FEX, so I didn’t collect full benchmarks here. The anti-cheat stuff is too weird and doesn’t get properly emulated.</p><p>However, the benchmark does offer a unique view into the challenges these low-power PCs face.</p><p><img alt="Doom: The Dark Ages benchmark" loading="lazy" src="https://scottjg.com/posts/2026-01-08-crappy-computer-showdown/doom-benchmark.jpg"></p><p>You can see it running on the Beelink here. The GPU is absolutely shredding through the Ultra quality frames at 4K resolution, but the CPU is really struggling. You can see the GPU is able to process almost 90 FPS, but because of the bottleneck at the CPU, the overall frame rate can’t break 30 FPS. That’s the main challenge here.</p><h3 id="alien-isolation-2014">Alien: Isolation (2014)</h3><p>My next thought was, maybe if we jump back a decade, we can have better luck. This game actually ships with a Linux port. Unfortunately the Linux port doesn’t include the built-in benchmark tool, so I ran it under Proton/WINE. I also found that DXVK caused every game from this point onward to crash immediately on the ARM hosts, so I run the games with <code>PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1</code> to fall back to the OpenGL renderer.</p><p>For those unfamiliar: DXVK translates DirectX calls to Vulkan, while WineD3D translates them to OpenGL. The GPU driver, when running on ARM, has a Vulkan implementation that apparently has issues when running under FEX that OpenGL avoids. Something to keep in mind if you’re trying to replicate this.</p><p><img alt="Screenshot of Alien: Isolation running the benchmark" loading="lazy" src="https://scottjg.com/posts/2026-01-08-crappy-computer-showdown/alien-isolation-rpi5.jpg"></p><p>Honestly, not the best looking game by modern standards, even on Ultra settings. It does have some cool lighting effects, at least. I admit I have never played this game for real, so I can’t vouch for it being fun or not. I just ran the benchmark tool.</p><p>I initially tested this game on the Beelink and thought it looked promising. Relatively low CPU usage. It seems like it is playable on the ROCK 5B with an average 23 FPS. Not sure about the Pi though, at only 15 FPS.</p><h3 id="hitman-absolution-2012">Hitman: Absolution (2012)</h3><p>OK, OK. So we already know the performance of the Pi is on par with a PC from 2008, so I figured, let’s go back a couple more years.</p><p><img alt="Hitman Absolution Benchmark" loading="lazy" src="https://scottjg.com/posts/2026-01-08-crappy-computer-showdown/hitman-absolution.jpg"></p><p>Couldn’t get the windowed mode to work right on this one, but I swear it’s running on the Raspberry Pi 5. You can probably tell from the FPS counter.</p><p>I would say the performance makes it basically unusable on these ARM machines.</p><p>That said, the Beelink really shines here. Windows perf is way ahead of Linux on this one too. More than playable on both, though.</p><p>I was actually a little puzzled by this one. It seems like it shouldn’t be this bad on the ARM hosts. This feels like a performance bug, but it’s hard to say where in the stack it might be. Oh well.</p><h3 id="just-cause-2-demo-2010">Just Cause 2 Demo (2010)</h3><p>OK, so let’s go back <em>another</em> couple years. This demo was free, thankfully.</p><p><img alt="Just Cause 2 Benchmark" loading="lazy" src="https://scottjg.com/posts/2026-01-08-crappy-computer-showdown/just-cause-2-rpi5.jpg"></p><p>So remember earlier when I said I had to disable DXVK for these games to run on ARM? On Intel Windows, I had to actually add DXVK because the game crashed immediately on launch. Weird.</p><p>Nearly 40 FPS average on a Raspberry Pi 5. 2010 is our year! Windows still dominates here. It’s more apples-to-apples on Beelink’s Linux vs Windows now since now both are using DXVK.</p><h3 id="portal-2-2011">Portal 2 (2011)</h3><p>After I had run all of these, I was curious to try Portal 2. Valve is the company that maintains Proton and FEX. You’d think they maybe would have optimized it for their own games. It’s also old enough that it’s in the sweet spot of potentially being playable on the Pi.</p><p><img alt="Portal 2" loading="lazy" src="https://scottjg.com/posts/2026-01-08-crappy-computer-showdown/portal2-rpi5.jpg"></p><p>Sadly, Portal 2 does not ship with a built-in benchmark. However, it does have a <code>timedemo</code> feature where you can record yourself playing and then play it back as a benchmark. I picked a random level and recorded it. Then, ran it on the test systems. Since there was a native version, I benchmarked that alongside the Proton/WINE version.</p><p>So, now that we have a native Linux port to compare with, it totally leaves Windows in the dust (finally). Most importantly, the Raspberry Pi 5 can play this game at 4K resolution, way above 60 FPS.</p><p>So I can now say with a straight face, that it’s possible to use the Raspberry Pi 5 to game in 4K, admittedly strapped to a GPU that’s roughly worth 10x the price of the Pi. In all seriousness, probably any lower-end GPU would work here. Clearly we’re not using the 5090 to its full potential anyway.</p><h2 id="power-usage">Power Usage</h2><p>These machines are also known to be low power. I guess for a gaming computer, I’m not sure how important that is. You can just turn it off when you’re not using it. That said, a gaming PC CPU could use 20-50w while completely idle.</p><p>For these measurements I took the idle power usage and also average power usage during the Cyberpunk 4K Ultra Raytracing benchmark, both measured at the AC outlet. This does not include the GPU, just the CPU, since that’s what we’re really comparing here.</p><p>The Pi 5 sips power at under 9W even under load, while the Beelink pulls almost 30W during the benchmark. One way of looking at it, is that the Beelink performs so much faster in games, and the amount of power is proportional to that.</p><p>Another way to look at it, is if the ARM-based machines weren’t mired in emulating x86, they probably would have considerably better performance on per-watt basis compared to the Intel CPU.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>So, can you game on a Raspberry Pi 5 with an RTX 5090? I guess, technically, yes. Would you want to? Probably not.</p><ul><li><strong>Modern games (2020+):</strong> Most likely unplayable. The CPU perf degradation under FEX is brutal. Even playing on the lowest 720p settings, Cyberpunk barely hits 16 FPS average on the Pi 5.</li><li><strong>2010-era games:</strong> If you’re trying to play older games, you can probably get away with it. You also probably do not need a graphics card as powerful as the 5090.</li></ul><p>The Beelink is the clear winner if you actually want to game. It’s still terrible, but it’s cheap, runs x86 natively, and with the right settings, it can hit 50 FPS+ in every game I tried. Windows consistently outperformed Linux on most WINE/Proton titles, so you’re probably better off just installing Windows on it.</p><p>The ROCK 5B edges out the Raspberry Pi 5 slightly in most benchmarks, but not by much. The extra cores and PCIe bandwidth don’t seem to matter as much as the raw performance lost to FEX emulation. That said, it does bring the game from painfully playable to borderline playable in some games.</p><p>Given all the momentum around ARM (Valve is about to ship an ARM VR headset, and NVIDIA is rumored to ship their own SoC with an NVIDIA GPU soon), I think future platforms will probably be better optimized, and Linux gaming on ARM will probably be more plausible in the future. Sadly, I don’t recommend strapping your super expensive graphics card to a cheap SBC for now. Unless it’s just for a fun blog post.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p id="first">Regular physical activity may ease symptoms of depression about as effectively as psychological therapy, according to an updated Cochrane review. When researchers compared exercise with antidepressant medication, they found similar benefits, although the certainty of that evidence was lower.</p><div id="text">
<p>Depression remains a major global health challenge, affecting more than 280 million people worldwide and contributing significantly to disability. Exercise stands out as a low cost and widely accessible option that also improves physical health, making it appealing to both patients and healthcare professionals.</p>
<p><strong>Inside the Cochrane Review</strong></p>
<p>The analysis was led by researchers at the University of Lancashire and drew on data from 73 randomized controlled trials involving nearly 5,000 adults diagnosed with depression. These studies examined how exercise compared with no treatment or control conditions, as well as with psychological therapies and antidepressant drugs.</p>
<p>Overall, the findings showed that exercise led to moderate reductions in depressive symptoms compared with no treatment. When measured against psychological therapy, exercise produced similar improvements, based on moderate certainty evidence from ten trials. Comparisons with antidepressant medication also suggested comparable effects, but the supporting evidence was limited and considered low certainty. Few studies tracked participants after treatment ended, leaving the long-term impact unclear.</p>
<p><strong>Safety and Side Effects</strong></p>
<p>Reported side effects were uncommon. People in exercise programs occasionally experienced muscle or joint injuries, while those taking antidepressants reported typical medication-related issues such as fatigue and gastrointestinal problems.</p>


<p>"Our findings suggest that exercise appears to be a safe and accessible option for helping to manage symptoms of depression," said Professor Andrew Clegg, lead author of the review. "This suggests that exercise works well for some people, but not for everyone, and finding approaches that individuals are willing and able to maintain is important."</p>
<p><strong>What Kind of Exercise Works Best</strong></p>
<p>The review found that light to moderate intensity activity may be more helpful than vigorous workouts. Greater improvements in depressive symptoms were linked to completing between 13 and 36 exercise sessions.</p>
<p>No single form of exercise clearly outperformed others. However, programs that combined different types of activity and resistance training appeared more effective than aerobic exercise alone. Some activities, including yoga, qigong and stretching, were not evaluated in this analysis and remain areas for future study. As with other findings, long-term benefits are still uncertain due to limited follow-up.</p>
<p><strong>Why Conclusions Remain Cautious</strong></p>
<p>This update added 35 new trials to earlier versions of the review published in 2008 and 2013. Even with the expanded evidence base, the main conclusions changed little. Many of the included studies were small, often involving fewer than 100 participants, which makes it harder to draw firm conclusions.</p>
<p>"Although we've added more trials in this update, the findings are similar," said Professor Clegg. "Exercise can help people with depression, but if we want to find which types work best, for who and whether the benefits last over time, we still need larger, high-quality studies. One large, well-conducted trial is much better than numerous poor quality small trials with limited numbers of participants in each."</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-pagefind-weight="2">
    <p>Nearly every bit of the high-tech world, from the most cutting-edge AI systems at the biggest companies, to the casual scraps of code cobbled together by college students, is annotated and described by the same, simple plain text format. Whether you’re trying to give complex instructions to ChatGPT, or you want to be able to exchange a grocery list in Apple Notes or copy someone’s homework in Google Docs, that same format will do the trick. The wild part is, the format wasn’t created by a conglomerate of tech tycoons, it was created by a curmudgeonly guy with a kind heart who right this minute is probably rewatching a Kubrick film while cheering for an absolutely indefensible sports team.</p>
<p>But it’s worth understanding how these simple little text files were born, not just because I get to brag about how generous and clever my friends are, but also because it reminds us of how the Internet <em>really</em> works: smart people think of good things that are crazy enough that they <em>just might work</em>, and then they give them away, over and over, until they slowly take over the world and make things better for everyone.</p>
<h2>Making Their Mark</h2>
<p>Though it’s now a building block of the contemporary Internet, like so many great things, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> just started out trying to solve a personal problem. In 2002, John Gruber made the unconventional decision to bet his online career on two completely irrational foundations: Apple, and blogs.</p>
<p>It’s hard to remember now, but in 2002, Apple was just a few years past having been on death’s door. As difficult as it may be to picture in today’s world where Apple keynotes are treated like major events, back then, almost nobody was covering Apple regularly, let alone writing <em>exclusively</em> about the company. There was barely even an “tech news” scene online at all, and virtually no one was blogging. So John’s decision to go all-in on Apple for his pioneering blog <a href="https://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a> was, well, a daring one. At the time, Apple had only <em>just</em> launched its first iPod that worked with Windows computers, and the iPhone was still a full five years in the future. But that single-minded focus, not just on Apple, but on obsessive detail in everything he covered, eventually helped inspire much of the technology media landscape that we see today. John’s timing was also perfect — from the doldrums of that era, Apple’s stock price would rise by about 120,000% in the years after Daring Fireball started, and its cultural relevance probably increased by even more than that.</p>
<p>By 2004, it wasn’t just Apple that had begun to take off: blogs and social media themselves had moved from obscurity to the very center of culture, and <a href="https://cybercultural.com/p/internet-2004/">a new era of web technology had begun</a>. At the beginning of that year, few people in the world even knew what a “blog” was, but by the end of 2004, blogs had become not just ubiquitous, but downright <em>cool</em>. As unlikely as it seems now, that year’s largely uninspiring slate of U.S. presidential candidates like Wesley Clark, Gary Hart and, yes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Dean_2004_presidential_campaign">Howard Dean</a> helped propel blogs into mainstream awareness during the Democratic primaries, alongside online pundits who had begun weighing in on politics and the issues and cultural moments at a pace that newspapers and TV couldn’t keep up with. A lot has been written about the transformation of media during those years, but less has been written about how the media and tech of the time transformed <em>each other</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.anildash.com/images/gary-hart-blog.JPG" alt="A photo from 2004 of a TV screen showing CNN, with a ticker saying &quot;Gary Hart Cyber Campaign Starts blog for possible 2004 presidential bid&quot;"></p>
<p>That era of early blogging was interesting in that nearly everyone who was writing the first popular sites was also busy helping <em>create</em> the tools for publishing them. Just like Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz had to pioneer combining studio-style flat lighting with 35mm filming in order to define the look of the modern sitcom, or Jimi Hendrix had to work with Roger Mayer to invent the signature guitar distortion pedals that defined the sound of rock and roll, the pioneers who defined the technical format and structures of blogging were often building the very tools of creation as they went along.</p>
<p>I got a front row seat to these acts of creation. At the time I was working on Movable Type, which was the most popular tool for publishing “serious” blogs, and helped popularize the medium. Two of my good friends had built the tool and quickly made it into the default choice for anybody who wanted to reach a big audience; it was kind of a combination of everything people do these days on WordPress and all the various email newsletter platforms and all of the “serious” podcasts (since podcasts wouldn’t be invented for another few months). But back in those early days, we’d watch people use our tools to set up Gawker or Huffington Post one day, and Daring Fireball or Waxy.org the next, and each of them would be the first of its kind, both in terms of its design and its voice. To this day, when I see something online that I love by Julianne Escobedo Shepherd or Ta-Nehisi Coates or Nilay Patel or Annalee Newitz or any one of dozens of other brilliant writers or creators, my first thought is often, “hey! They used to type in that app that I used to make!” Because sometimes those writers would inspire us to make a new feature in the publishing tools, and sometimes they would have hacked up a new feature all by themselves in between typing up their new blog posts.</p>
<p>A really clear, and very simple, early example of how we learned that lesson was when we changed the size of the box that people used to type in just to create the posts on their sites. We made the box a little bit taller, mostly for aesthetic reasons. Within a few weeks, we’d found that posts on sites like Gawker had gotten longer, <em>mostly because the box was bigger</em>. This seems obvious now, years after we saw tweets get longer when Twitter expanded from 140 characters to 280 characters, but at the time this was a terrifying glimpse at how much power a couple of young product managers in a conference room in California would have over the media consumption of the entire world every time they made a seemingly-insignificant decision.</p>
<p>The <em>other</em> dirty little secret was, typing in the box in that old blogging app could be… pretty wonky sometimes. People who wanted to do normal things like include an image or link in their blog post, or even just make some text bold, often had to learn somewhat-obscure HTML formatting, memorizing the actual language that’s used to make web pages. Not everybody knew all the details of how to make pages that way, and if they made even one small mistake, sometimes they could break the whole design of their site. It made things feel very fraught every time a writer went to publish something new online, and got in the way of the increasingly-fast pace of sharing ideas now that social media was taking over the public conversation.</p>
<p>Enter John and his magical text files.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.anildash.com/images/markdown-text-hero-slice.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2>Marking up and marking down</h2>
<p>The purpose of Markdown is really simple: It lets you use the regular characters on your keyboard which you already use while typing out things like emails, to make fancy formatting of text for the web. That HTML format that’s used to make web pages stands for HyperText Markup Language. The word “markup” there means you’re “marking up” your text with all kinds of special characters.
Only, the special characters can be kind of arcane. Want to put in a link to everybody’s favorite website? Well, you’re going to have to type in <code>&lt;a href="https://anildash.com/"&gt;Anil Dash’s blog&lt;/a&gt;</code> I could explain why, and what it all means, but honestly, you get the point — it’s a lot! Too much. What if you could just write out the text and then the link, sort of like you might within an email? Like: <code>[Anil Dash’s blog](https://anildash.com)</code>! And then the right thing would happen. Seems great, right?</p>
<p>The same thing works for things like putting a header on a page. For example, as I’m writing this right now, if I want to put a big headline on this page, I can just type <code>#How Markdown Took Over the World</code> and the right thing will happen.</p>
<p>If mark_up_ is complicated, then the opposite of that complexity must be… markd_own_. This kind of solution, where it’s so smart it seems obvious in hindsight, is key to Markdown’s success. John worked to make a format that was so simple that anybody could pick it up in a few minutes, and powerful enough that it could help people express pretty much anything that they wanted to include while writing on the internet. At a technical level, it was also easy enough to implement that John could write the code himself to make it work with Movable Type, his publishing tool of choice. (Within days, people had implemented the same feature for most of the other blogging tools of the era; these days, virtually every app that you can type text into ships with Markdown support as a feature on day one.)</p>
<p>Prior to launch, John had enlisted our mutual friend, the late, dearly missed <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/">Aaron Swartz</a>, as a beta tester. In addition to being extremely fluent in every detail of the blogging technologies of the time, Aaron was, most notably, seventeen years old. And though Aaron’s activism and untimely passing have resulted in him having been turned into something of a mythological figure, one of the greatest things about Aaron was that he could be a total pain in the ass, which made him <em>terrific</em> at reporting bugs in your software. (One of the last email conversations I ever had with Aaron was him pointing out some obscure bugs in an open source app I was working on at the time.) No surprise, Aaron instantly understood both the potential and the power of Markdown, and was a top-tier beta tester for the technology as it was created. His astute feedback helped finely hone the final product so it was ready for the world, and when Markdown <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2004/03/introducing_markdown">quietly debuted in March of 2004</a>, it was clear that text files around the web were about to get a permanent upgrade.</p>
<p>The most surprising part of what happened next wasn’t that everybody immediately started using it to write their blogs; that was, after all, what the tool was designed to do. It’s that everybody started using Markdown to do <em>everything else</em>, too.</p>
<h2>Hitting the Mark</h2>
<p>It’s almost impossible to overstate the ubiquity of Markdown within the modern computer industry in the decades since its launch.</p>
<p>After being nagged about it by users for more than a decade, Google finally <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/29/23002138/google-docs-markdown-support-formatting-update">added support for Markdown to Google Docs</a>, though it took them years of fiddly improvements to make it truly usable. Just last year, Microsoft added support for Markdown to its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/677474/microsoft-windows-notepad-bold-italic-text-formatting-markdown-support">venerable Notepad app</a>, perhaps in attempt to assuage the tempers of users who were still in disbelief that Notepad had been bloated with AI features. Nearly every powerful group messaging app, from Slack to WhatsApp to Discord, has support for Markdown in messages. And even the company that indirectly inspired all of this in the first place finally got on board: the most recent version of Apple Notes <a href="https://apple.gadgethacks.com/how-to/ios-26-notes-app-finally-gets-markdown-support-this-fall/">finally added support</a> for Markdown. (It’s an especially striking launch by Apple due to its timing, shortly after John had used his platform as the most influential Apple writer in the world to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino">blog about the utter failure</a> of the “Apple Intelligence” AI launch.)</p>
<p>But it’s not just the apps that you use on your phone or your laptop. For developers, Markdown has long been the lingua franca of the tools we string together to accomplish our work. On GitHub, the platform that nearly every developer in the world uses to share their code, nearly <em>every single repository of code</em> on the site has at least one Markdown file that’s used to describe its contents. Many have <em>dozens</em> of files describing all the different aspects of their project. And some of the repositories on GitHub consist of nothing <em>but</em> massive collections of Markdown files. The small tools and automations we run to perform routine tasks, the one-off reports that we generate to make sure something worked correctly, the confirmations that we have a system email out when something goes wrong, the temporary files we use when trying to recover some old data —&nbsp;all of these default to being Markdown files.</p>
<p>As a result, there are now <em>billions</em> of Markdown files lying around on hard drives around the world. Billions more are stashed in the cloud. There are some on the phone in your pocket. Programmers leave them lying around wherever their code might someday be running. Your kid’s Nintendo Switch has Markdown files on it. If you’re listening to music, there’s probably a Markdown file on the memory chip of the tiny system that controls the headphones stuck in your ears. <em>The Markdown is inside you right now!</em></p>
<h2>Down For Whatever</h2>
<p>So far, these were all things we could have foreseen when John first unleashed his little text tool on the world. I would have been surprised about how <em>many</em> people were using it, but not really the <em>ways</em> in which they were using it. If you’d have said “Twenty years in the future, all the different note-taking apps people use save their files using Markdown!”, I would have said, “Okay, that makes sense!”</p>
<p>What I <em>wouldn’t</em> have asked, though, was “Is John getting paid?” As hard as it may be to believe, back in 2004, the <em>default</em> was that people made new standards for open technologies like Markdown, and just shared them freely for the good of the internet, and the world, and then went on about their lives. If it happened to have unleashed billions of dollars of value for others, then so much the better. If they got some credit along the way, that was great, too. But mostly you just did it to solve a problem for yourself and for other like-minded people. And also, maybe, to help make sure that some jerk didn’t otherwise create some horrible proprietary alternative that would lock everybody into their terrible inferior version forever instead. (We didn’t have the word “enshittification” yet, but we did have Cory Doctorow and we did have plain text files, so we kind of knew where things were headed.)</p>
<p>To give a sense of the vibe of that era, the term “podcasting” had been coined just a month before Markdown was released, and went into wider use that fall, and was similarly <a href="https://www.anildash.com/2024/02/05/wherever-you-get-podcasts/">a radically open system</a> that wasn’t owned by any big company and that empowered people to do whatever they wanted to do to express themselves. (And podcasting was another technology that Aaron Swartz helped improve by being a brilliant pain in the ass. But I’ll save that story for another book-length essay.)</p>
<p>That attitude of being not-quite-_anti_commercial, but perhaps just not even really <em>concerned</em> with whether something was commercial or not seems downright quaint in an era when the tech tycoons are not just the wealthiest people in the world, but also some of the weirdest and most obnoxious as well. But the truth is, most people <em>today</em> who make technology are actually still exceedingly normal, and quite generous. It’s just that they’ve been overshadowed by their bosses who are out of their minds and building rocket ships and siring hundreds of children and embracing overt white supremacy instead of making fun tools for helping you type text, like regular people do.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.anildash.com/images/markdown-text-hero-slice2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2>The Markdown Model</h2>
<p>The part about not doing this stuff solely for money matters, because even the <em>most</em> advanced LLM systems today, what the big AI companies call their “frontier” models, require complex orchestration that’s carefully scripted by people who’ve tuned their prompts for these systems through countless rounds of trial and error. They’ve iterated and tested and watched for the results as these systems hallucinated or failed or ran amok, chewing up countless resources  along the way. And sometimes, they generated genuinely astonishing outputs, things that are truly amazing to consider that modern technology can achieve. The rate of progress and evolution, even factoring in the mind-boggling amounts of investment that are going into these systems, is rivaled only by the initial development of the personal computer or the Internet, or the early space race.</p>
<p>And all of it — <em>all of it</em> —&nbsp;is controlled through Markdown files. When you see the brilliant work shown off from somebody who’s bragging about what they made ChatGPT generate for them, or someone is understandably proud about the code that they got Claude to create, all of the most advanced work has been prompted in Markdown. Though where the logic of Markdown was originally a very simple version of "use human language to tell the machine what to do", the implications have gotten far more dire when they use a format designed to help expresss "make this <code>**bold**</code>" to tell the computer itself "<code>make this imaginary girlfriend more compliant</code>".</p>
<p>But we already know that the Big AI companies are run by people who don't reckon with the implications of their work. They could never understand that every single project that's even moderately ambitious on these new AI platforms is being written up in files formatted according to this system created by one guy who has never asked for a dime for this work. An entire generation of AI coders has been born since Markdown was created who probably can’t even imagine that this technology even <em>has</em> an "inventor". It’s just always been here, like the Moon, or Rihanna.</p>
<p>But it’s important for <em>everyone</em> to know that the Internet, and the tech industry, don’t run without the generosity and genius of regular people. It is not just billion-dollar checks and Silicon Valley boardrooms that enable creativity over years, decades, or generations —&nbsp;it’s often a guy with a day job who just gives a damn about doing something right, sweating the details and assuming that if he cares enough about what he makes then others will too. The <em>majority</em> of the technical infrastructure of the Internet was created in this way. For free, often by people in academia, or as part of their regular work, with no promise of some big payday or getting a ton of credit.</p>
<p>The people who make the <em>real</em> Internet and the real innovations also don’t look for ways to hurt the world around them, or the people around them. Sometimes, as in the case of Aaron, the world hurts them more than anyone should ever have to bear. I know not everybody cares that much about plain text files on the Internet; I will readily admit I am a huge nerd about this stuff in a way that maybe most normal people are not. But I do think everybody cares about <em>some</em> part of the wonderful stuff on the Internet in this way, and I want to fight to make sure that everybody can understand that it’s not just five terrible tycoons who built this shit. Real people did. Good people. I saw them do it.</p>
<p>The trillion-dollar AI industry's system for controlling their most advanced platforms is a plain text format one guy made up for his blog and then bounced off of a 17-year-old kid before sharing it with the world for free. You're welcome, Time Magazine's people of the year, <em>The Architects of AI</em>. Their achievement is every bit as impressive as yours.</p>

<h2 id="top-ten">The Ten Technical Reasons Markdown Won</h2>
<p>Okay, with some of the narrative covered, what can we <em>learn</em> from Markdown’s success? How did this thing really take off? What could we do if we wanted to replicate something like this in the modern era? Let’s consider a few key points:</p>
<h3>1. Had a great brand.</h3>
<p>Okay, let’s be real: “Markdown” as a name is clever as hell. Get it it’s not markup, it’s mark <em>down</em>. You just can’t argue with that kind of logic. People who knew what the “M” in “HTML” stood for could understand the reference, and to everyone else, it was just a clearly-understandable name for a useful utility.</p>
<h3>2. Solved a real problem.</h3>
<p>This one is not obvious, but it’s really important that a new technology have a <em>real</em> problem that it’s trying to solve, instead of just being an abstract attempt to do something vague, like “make text files better”. Millions of people were encountering the idea that it was too difficult or inconvenient to write out full HTML by hand, and even if one had the necessary skills, it was nice to be able to do so in a format that was legible as plain text as well.</p>
<h3>3. Built on behaviors that already existed.</h3>
<p>This is one of the most quietly genius parts of Markdown: The format is based on the ways people had been adding emphasis and formatting to their text for years or even decades. Some of the formatting choices dated back to the early days of email, so they’d been ingrained in the culture of the internet for a full generation before Markdown existed. It was so familiar, people could be writing Markdown <em>without even knowing it</em>.</p>
<h3>4. Mirrored RSS in its origin.</h3>
<p>Around the same time that Markdown was taking off, RSS was maturing into its ubiquitous form as well. The format had existed for some years already, enabling various kinds of content syndication, but at this time, it was adding support for the technologies that would come to be known as podcasting as well. And just like RSS, Markdown was spearheaded by a smart technologist who was also more than a little stubborn about defining a format that would go on to change the way we share content on the internet. In RSS’ case, it was pioneered by Dave Winer, and with Markdown it was John Gruber, and both were tireless in extolling the virtues of the plain text formats they’d helped pioneer. They could both leverage blogs to get the word out, and to get feedback on how to build on their wins.</p>
<h3>5. There was a community ready to help.</h3>
<p>One great thing about a format like Markdown is that its success is never just the result of one person. Vitally, Markdown was part of a community that could build on it right from the start. Right from the beginning, Markdown was inspired by earlier works like Textile, a formatting system for plain text created by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021226035527/http://textism.com/tools/textile/">Dean Allen</a>. Many of us appreciated and were inspired by Dean, who was a pioneer of blogging tools in the early days of social media, but if there’s a bigger fan of Dean Allen on the internet than John Gruber, I’ve never met them. Similarly, <a href="http://www.rememberaaronsw.com/memories/">Aaron Swartz</a>, the brilliant young technologist who’s known best known as an activist for digital rights and access, was at that time just a super brilliant teenager that a lot of us loved hacking with. He was the most valuable beta tester of Markdown prior to its release, helping to shape it into a durable and flexible format that’s stood the test of time.</p>
<h3>6. Had the right flavor for every different context.</h3>
<p>Because Markdown’s format was frozen in place (and had some super-technical details that people could debate about) and people wanted to add features over time, various communities that were implementing Markdown could add their own “flavors” of it as they needed. Popular ones came to be called Commonmark and Github-Flavored, led by various companies or teams that had divergent needs for the tool. While tech geeks tend to obsess over needing everything to be “correct”, in reality it often just <em>doesn’t matter</em> that much, and in the real world, the entire Internet is made up of content that barely follows the technical rules that it’s supposed to.</p>
<h3>7. Released at a time of change in behaviors and habits.</h3>
<p>This is a subtle point, but an important one: Markdown came along at the right time in the evolution of its medium. You can get people to change their behaviors when they’re using a new tool, or adopting a new technology. In this case, blogging (and all of social media!) were new, so saying “here’s a new way of typing a list of bullet points” wasn’t much an additional learning curve to add to the mix. If you can take advantage of catching people while they’re already in a learning mood, you can really tap into the moment when they’re most open-minded to new things.</p>
<h3>8. Came right on the cusp of the “build tool era”.</h3>
<p>This one’s a bit more technical, but also important to understand. In the first era of building for the web, people often built the web’s languages of HTML, Javascript and CSS by hand, by themselves, or stitched these formats together from subsets or templates. But in many cases, these were fairly simple compositions, made up of smaller pieces that were written in the same languages. As things matured, the roles for web developers specialized (there started to be backend developers vs. front-end, or people who focused on performance vs. those who focused on visual design), and as a result the tooling for developers matured. On the other side of this transition, developers began to use many different programming languages, frameworks and tools, and the standard step before trying to deploy a website was to have an automated build process that transformed the “raw materials” of the site into the finished product. Since Markdown is a raw material that has to be transformed into HTML, it perfectly fit this new workflow as it became the de facto standard method of creation and collaboration.</p>
<h3>9. Worked with “View source”</h3>
<p>Most of the technologies that work best on the web enable creators to “view source” just like HTML originally did when the first web browsers were created. In this philosophy, one can look at the source code that makes up a web page, and understand how it was constructed so that you can make your own. With Markdown, it only takes one glimpse of a source Markdown file for anyone to understand how they might make a similar file of their own, or to extrapolate how they might apply analogous formatting to their own documents. There’s no teaching required when people can just see it for themselves.</p>
<h3>10. Not encumbered in IP</h3>
<p>This one’s obvious if you think about it, but it can’t go unsaid: There are no legal restrictions around Markdown. You wouldn’t <em>think</em> that anybody would be foolish or greedy enough to try to patent something as simple as Markdown, but there are many far worse examples of patent abuse in the tech industry. Fortunately, John Gruber is not an awful person, and nobody else has (yet) been brazen enough to try to usurp the format for their own misadventures in intellectual property law. As a result, nobody’s been afraid, either to use the format, or to support creating or reading the format in their apps.</p>

			Thanks for the suggestion, wish I'd seen it earlier. Clearing Play Store and Services cache/data didn't help, it wouldn't allow the store to even check for updates. Install location I was able to set to 1, though it was auto. After reboots, disabling GMS and Play Store spoofing in PI, I was able to at least check for updates again. Even if I disable all settings in PI, still says not enough room, there must be a setting there I'm forgetting? FWIW, I can't even get play store to update from within the About tab in Store. I don't know what I did here haha.

Ok, still you can check PI Attesting directly in PlayStore. Go to Settings, General, About and keep tapping to the Playstore version until you become a developer<p>

Then go a step back, into that new Developer Options and run Check Integrity there</p><p>

You should pass PI Attest but for the Brand, Device, Model, PlayStore must properly show your actual values, not the spoofed values</p><p>

Also, check in your custom.pif.prop, your spoof settings should be<br>
<code>spoofBuild=1
spoofProps=1
spoofProvider=0
spoofVendingSdk=0
spoofVendingFinger=0</code></p><p>

and in target txt you must have (among others - depending which apps you use):<br>
<code>com.android.vending
com.google.android.gms</code></p></div>

Ok, within the play store integrity, this checks out. It passes and shows my actual values. <p>

My custom.pif.prop had so of those but also spoofSignature=1</p><p>

Target.txt had many items but also those 2 required ones. I went back to tricky store and selected only necessary including those 2, then realized the target file. None of this worked however, i still have no room it claims. </p><p>

Fix the Pending Update Loop with ADB<br>

	
	


<div dir="ltr">
		<pre dir="ltr" data-xf-init="code-block" data-lang="bash"><code># Clear Play Store and GMS data with shell more thorough than the UI

You also might need to address the PI and Device Spoofing issue. Make sure that you haven't enabled Force Basic Attestation with a fingerprint from a device with very little storage because you’ve been messing with PI modules and now the Store thinks it’s living on a 2012 toaster with 8GB of storage.<p>

Check <code>/data/adb/modules/</code> for any folder related to PI or spoofing.</p><div dir="ltr">
		<pre dir="ltr" data-xf-init="code-block" data-lang=""><code>adb shell getprop | grep -E "model|product|fingerprint"</code></pre>
	</div>If these values don't jive with your actual phone, your spoofing module is still active even if disabled in the app.<p>

Since your About tab won't update, the bin might be corrupted. Sideloading a fresh version sometimes fixes the installation directory permissions and remember to reboot in between any changes that you make. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)</p></div>

I had the nohello module active for reasons. Once I disabled it, the store works again.

I mean if they could find a reason to do it then they would. People may have wild conspiracy theories but that's very reasonable, given that I said a while ago that the head of our political system was the minister of public security aka the police.</div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td>Vendor</td><td>Flock Safety</td></tr><tr><td>Affected Products</td><td>Flock Safety's ArcGIS, FlockOS, Aerodome, Flock911</td></tr><tr><td>Vulnerability Type</td><td>Hardcoded API Key Exposure (CWE-798)</td></tr><tr><td>Exposure Count</td><td>53 separate instances across public-facing assets compromising 50 data layers</td></tr><tr><td>Data at Risk</td><td>~5,000 police departments, ~6,000 community deployments, and ~1,000 private businesses</td></tr><tr><td>Status</td><td>Remediated following responsible disclosure</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2>Executive Summary</h2><p>I discovered a Default ArcGIS API key embedded in Flock Safety's public-facing JavaScript bundles. This single credential granted access to the company's ArcGIS mapping environment, and 50 private layers, the same infrastructure that consolidates license plate detections, patrol car locations, drone telemetry, body camera locations, 911 call data, and surveillance camera locations from approximately 12,000 law enforcement, community, and private sector deployments nationwide.</p><p>The key was not restricted by referrer, IP, or origin allowing it to be used by anyone, anywhere. It was exposed publicly across <strong>53 separate Flock Safety front-end bundles and environments</strong>, each instance independently granting access to their ArcGIS mapping platform.</p><hr><h2>Background: What is Flock Safety?</h2><p>Across the United States, license plate readers, drones, and audio sensors quietly record the movements of millions of people every day. Flock Safety operates one of the largest and most rapidly expanding of these networks, with hundreds of thousands of cameras generating over 30 billion vehicle detections each month, and an undisclosed amount of people detections.</p><p>At the center of this infrastructure is <strong>FlockOS</strong>, which Flock markets under the headline <em>"One map. Smarter Response."</em> According to their own documentation, the ArcGIS-powered interface "consolidates all data streams and the locations of each connected asset, enabling greater situational awareness and a common operating procedure." (<a href="https://cleargov.com/resource/cg-prod-v2/projects/documents/8491cdf11839242bf5e2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: ClearGov Resource Document</a>)</p><p>That "one map" is not a metaphor. It is the ArcGIS stack itself and the exposed API key unlocked it.</p><hr><h2>The Vulnerability</h2><p>The exposed credential was an organization-wide ArcGIS API key tied directly to Flock Safety's ArcGIS mapping environment. It appeared in client-side JavaScript bundles served from development subdomains that were publicly accessible.</p><p>Querying the ArcGIS API with this key returned metadata confirming its scope and the extent of Flock's misconfiguration:</p><p><img alt="Flock API Key (Redacted)" loading="lazy" width="453" height="869" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://nexanet.ai/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fapi_key_red.11cc04d8.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 1x, https://nexanet.ai/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fapi_key_red.11cc04d8.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://nexanet.ai/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fapi_key_red.11cc04d8.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75"></p><p>The credential was tagged appTitle: "Default API Key", the auto-generated key Esri creates at account signup. According to <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/python/latest/guide/part1-what-is-geocoding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Esri's ArcGIS documentation</a>:</p><blockquote>"An API key is a permanent access token that defines the scope and permission for granting your public-facing application access to specific, ready-to-use services <strong>and private content</strong>... <strong>An API key is created for you when you sign up for an ArcGIS Developer account.</strong>"</blockquote><p>The key's metadata listed 50 "portal:app:access:item: privileges each granting access to a private ArcGIS item.</p><p>Given Flock's centralized "one map" architecture where participating agencies contribute data to shared, Flock-owned layers rather than maintaining separate instances each of those 50 private items likely aggregates data from hundreds or thousands of agencies. A single Detections layer would contain hotlist hits from all ~5,000 participating police departments. A single Mobile Units layer would show patrol car positions across every integrated agency.</p><p>Esri's documentation warns:</p><blockquote>"For the highest level of security, always set the API key scopes and referrers before deploying an application."</blockquote><p>Flock applied no referrer restrictions, no IP allowlist, and no scope limitations. They took the default key, granted it access to 50 private items, and embedded it in client-side JavaScript bundles across 53 publicly accessible endpoints:</p><div><p>53 Exposed Endpoints (hostnames redacted):</p><p><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com </code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../flock-DzA9VKXM.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../index-slKO6jum.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../index-BBRurSLX.js</code></p><details><summary>Show all 53 endpoints</summary><p><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../index-BPxp6hzB.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../subjectMessageExpireWorker-BoZI8MYY.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../notificationExpireWorker-_11bsRZ0.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../notificationAnalyticsTracker-NGZrpZsD.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../visualSearchExpiringWorker-na0tVtmO.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../prepared911ExpireWorker-BpcA2uVs.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../visualSearchExpireWorker-DLZtzWUN.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../index-xrDxc-Lv.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../subjectMessageExpireWorker-J-ZVyGSG.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../notificationExpireWorker-4m9KycyN.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../notificationAnalyticsTracker-by_qQfZs.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../visualSearchExpireWorker-reQjrWVk.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../prepared911ExpireWorker-XS3Uur-m.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../index-ztnhrNoG.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../notificationAnalyticsTracker-HA5zO2gU.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../notificationExpireWorker-8Pe_fNZM.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../visualSearchExpiringWorker-Dro5OKrq.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../visualSearchExpireWorker-wJjUIzMY.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../prepared911ExpireWorker-9gsy_LJ6.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../subjectMessageExpireWorker--KqStPhO.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../visualSearchExpiringWorker-3cNFqmkh.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../index-Bas-zpR9.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../subjectMessageExpireWorker-B1jQx_EB.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../notificationAnalyticsTracker-DYLz-f8O.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../notificationExpireWorker-Bix-gxWk.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../visualSearchExpiringWorker-5vLUhmkY.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../prepared911ExpireWorker-DA2TrQ_9.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../visualSearchExpireWorker-D6gTd4TT.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../index-DGGtSpOn.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../subjectMessageExpireWorker-D1Fw4UF9.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../notificationExpireWorker-wjAN01b6.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../notificationAnalyticsTracker-BoXGrJ_I.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../prepared911ExpireWorker-CYEuywlF.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../visualSearchExpireWorker-BM2HGkks.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../visualSearchExpiringWorker-DW-LQUZh.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../index-BtFbKoWO.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../notificationExpireWorker-Bs_qqZKK.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../notificationAnalyticsTracker-W6tR54zI.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../subjectMessageExpireWorker-D3Gi0z83.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../visualSearchExpireWorker-gofSdgry.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../visualSearchExpiringWorker-HayKEVyk.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../prepared911ExpireWorker-BzI_7Vif.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../index-DrW4QnA-.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../subjectMessageExpireWorker-D3Gi0z83.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../notificationExpireWorker-Bs_qqZKK.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../notificationAnalyticsTracker-W6tR54zI.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../visualSearchExpireWorker-gofSdgry.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../visualSearchExpiringWorker-HayKEVyk.js</code><code>[redacted].flocksafety.com/.../prepared911ExpireWorker-BzI_7Vif.js</code></p></details></div><p>Each endpoint independently served the same unrestricted credential 53 times, and any one of them could have been used to access Flock's ArcGIS environment.</p><hr><h2>FlockOS: The Unified Attack Surface</h2><p>The FlockOS map component signature reveals the unified layer architecture:</p><pre><code>ru=({

This vulnerability allows unauthenticated users to obtain valid ArcGIS tokens scoped to Flock Safety's production environment from their development environment, tokens titled "Flock Safety Prod" that grant access to the geographic mapping of Flock's camera network locations.</p><ul><li><strong>November 13, 2025</strong> — Initial disclosure sent to Flock Safety security team</li><li><strong>November 14, 2025</strong> — First follow-up requesting confirmation of receipt</li><li><strong>November 19, 2025</strong> — Second follow-up; Flock Safety finally acknowledges receipt</li><li><strong>January 7, 2026</strong> — Vulnerability remains unpatched (55+ days)</li></ul><p>I am withholding specific technical details to prevent exploitation while the vulnerability remains unpatched. However, its existence more than 55 days after responsible disclosure with no remediation, demonstrates a systemic pattern of credential mismanagement.</p><h3>Comparing the Exposed Credentials</h3><div><table><thead><tr><th>Property</th><th>Default API Key</th><th>Flock Safety Prod</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Portal Item Access</td><td>50 private items</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Camera Network Access</td><td>Yes (via item access)</td><td>Yes (direct FeatureLayer)</td></tr><tr><td>Source</td><td>Dev site JS bundles</td><td>Unauthenticated token minting</td></tr><tr><td>Status</td><td>Fixed (June 2025)</td><td>Unpatched (55+ days)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Both keys operated under the same active subscription with nearly one million available credits. Critically, <strong>development environments were configured with broader access than production</strong>, and those development sites were publicly accessible.</p><hr><h2>Scope Limitations and Evidentiary Standard</h2><p>The 50 "portal:app:access:item" privileges reference private item IDs that cannot be inventoried without actively querying each one which I did not do. However, ArcGIS collaboration features allow partner organizations to share layers into another organization's portal, and evidence suggests this capability was actively used.</p><p>An individual at a sheriff's office with an active Flock deployment confirmed during the course of this research that their agency shares ArcGIS layers directly with Flock Safety's organization. This corroborates the technical architecture documented in Esri's collaboration documentation and aligns with the privilege structure observed in the exposed credential metadata.</p><p>What I <em>can</em> state with certainty:</p><ol><li>The API key's metadata explicitly listed 50 <code>portal:app:access:item:</code> privileges granting access to private ArcGIS items</li><li>Esri's own documentation confirms that such privileges grant access to "hosted feature services, web maps, web scenes, tile layers" and other private portal content</li><li>A law enforcement source with direct knowledge of their agency's Flock integration confirmed that layer sharing with Flock Safety's ArcGIS organization occurs in practice</li><li>The key appeared across 53 publicly accessible endpoints with no referrer restrictions, IP limitations, or access controls</li><li>Many of the photo's I've used as examples are from publicly exposed ArcGIS datasets owned by Police Departments, that have relevant Flock Safety data in them.</li></ol><p>Taken together, these findings establish that the exposed credential provided a viable technical pathway to access shared law enforcement data. The precise contents of each private layer remain unverified, yet the circumstantial evidence is substantial.</p><hr><h2>Why This Matters: National Security Implications</h2><h3>Intelligence Value of Movement Data</h3><p>Foreign intelligence services would not need access to communications content if they could reliably observe movement at this scale. Historical location data revealing the presence, routines, and associations of politicians, federal agents, intelligence personnel, military leadership, or special operations units constitutes intelligence in its own right.</p><p>Consider a scenario: If members of SEAL Team 6 or Delta Force disappear from roadways for several days, that absence is itself a signal. If, during the same timeframe, a primary French translator also vanishes from routine movement patterns, the signal sharpens. A coordinated absence across these roles would strongly suggest the initiation of a special operations mission inferred solely from movement data collected by a nationwide license plate reader network. A top secret clearance wouldn't be needed for top secret information.</p><p>China has previously compromised hotel infrastructure for years at a time, not to surveil ordinary guests, but to capture rare overlaps where officials from different countries stayed in the same location on the same night. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/11/us/politics/trump-china-trade.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a>) If adversaries are willing to infiltrate hotel systems for fragments of movement data, the intelligence value of a nationwide, centralized surveillance map should be self-evident.</p><h3>Domestic Risks</h3><p>Persistent, indiscriminate movement tracking enables coercion, blackmail, and influence operations that do not require access to communications content. Members of Congress, senior military leaders, diplomats, corporate executives and their spouses and children are all placed at heightened risk. With sufficient coverage and time, patterns of life emerge. Affairs, undisclosed meetings, sensitive relationships, and routine behaviors become visible once movement data is collected and correlated at scale.</p><p>This is not a theoretical concern. The documented history of law enforcement misuse of license plate reader systems, including Flock's own platforms, demonstrates that access to movement data is routinely weaponized for personal purposes by those entrusted with it.</p><h4>Documented Cases of Flock Camera Misuse</h4><p><strong>Braselton, Georgia (November 2025):</strong> Police Chief Michael Steffman was arrested and charged with stalking, harassment, and multiple counts of misusing automated license plate recognition systems after a months-long Georgia Bureau of Investigation probe revealed he used Flock cameras to track and harass multiple individuals. Steffman resigned hours before his arrest after serving the department for 20 years. Subsequent public records analysis by the grassroots coalition Get The Flock Out revealed that Steffman had searched Flock data from agencies in other states, including Capitola, California, demonstrating the cross-jurisdictional reach enabled by Flock's network sharing capabilities. (<a href="https://lookout.co/georgia-police-chief-arrested-for-using-flock-cameras-for-stalking-and-harassment-searched-capitola-data-earlier-this-year/story" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a>)</p><p><strong>Sedgwick, Kansas (2023–2024):</strong> Police Chief Lee Nygaard used Flock Safety license plate readers to track his ex-girlfriend's vehicle 164 times and her new boyfriend's vehicle 64 times over a four-month period. He logged false justifications including "missing child," "drug investigation," and "suspicious activity" to conceal the personal nature of his searches. Nygaard also followed the couple in his patrol vehicle outside city limits. He resigned during the misconduct investigation. His police certification was revoked, though he faced no criminal charges. (<a href="https://local12.com/news/nation-world/police-chief-gets-caught-using-license-plate-cameras-to-track-his-ex-girlfriend-228-times-arrests-charges-probation-flock-safety-follow-stalk-new-boyfriend-broke-up-out-of-town-misuse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a>)</p><p><strong>Orange City, Florida (2024–2025):</strong> Officer Jarmarus Brown was arrested and charged with stalking and unauthorized computer access after using Flock license plate readers to track his ex-girlfriend's whereabouts for approximately seven months. An audit revealed he had repeatedly run tags for three specific vehicles. A fellow officer had warned Brown to "stop running her vehicle in that system because he could get in trouble" a warning Brown ignored. Brown also placed a GPS AirTag in the victim's wallet without her knowledge. When confronted by investigators, Brown admitted the situation was "dumb as hell on my end." He was served termination paperwork following his arrest. (<a href="https://www.clickorlando.com/news/local/2025/02/05/dumb-as-hell-orange-city-officer-accused-of-stalking-woman-using-license-plate-readers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a>)</p><p>These cases share common patterns: trusted officials often in leadership positions weaponizing surveillance tools against women with no connection to criminal investigations. The systems provided few meaningful barriers to misuse, and detection typically occurred only after victims independently reported suspicious behavior.</p><h3>Congressional Concerns Validated</h3><p>My research directly supports Senator Ron Wyden's claims that "Flock cannot live up to its commitment to protect the privacy and security of Oregonians" (<a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/wyden_letter_to_flock.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Letter to Flock</a>) and his urging for the "Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigate Flock Safety... and, where appropriate, hold the company responsible for its negligent cybersecurity practices" (<a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/wyden_letter_to_ftc_on_flockpdf.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Letter to FTC</a>).</p><hr><h2>On Flock's Security Claims</h2><p>After the City of Staunton canceled its Flock Safety contract, CEO Garrett Langley sent an unsolicited email to Staunton Police Department (<a href="https://www.ci.staunton.va.us/home/showpublisheddocument/13448/639017375545800000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a>) stating:</p><blockquote>"I'm writing to you directly because I want there to be zero confusion about what's happening. <strong>Flock has never been hacked. Ever.</strong>"</blockquote><p>That statement is technically correct only in the narrowest sense. The absence of a breach was not the result of internal security controls, audits, or monitoring but of responsible disclosure. I identified the vulnerability and reported it so it could be remediated.</p><p>The absence of a hack does not imply the presence of security. Had this credential been found by anyone else, this may have been one of the largest data breaches and national security incidents of this decade.</p><h3>On Compliance Claims</h3><p>In the same communication, Flock asserted:</p><blockquote>"<strong>Flock is CJIS compliant</strong>"<br>"<strong>Flock adheres to the highest security standards, including NDAA, SOC 2 (Type II), SOC 3, ISO 27001, HECVAT, FERPA, and alignment with NIST and CAIQ.</strong>"</blockquote><p>As a cybersecurity professional who has conducted dozens of compliance assessments, these statements are familiar. Compliance frameworks are often mistaken for guarantees of security, when in reality they are <strong>scoped evaluations of specific controls</strong>, not comprehensive examinations of an organization's risk posture. The scope of what is tested is defined by the company being assessed, which means compliance reflects what was reviewed, not everything that exists.</p><p>I requested access to Flock's audit reports; they were not provided. What I can say is this: a default, organization-wide API key embedded across 53 publicly reachable development and production-adjacent web assets would not survive even a basic review for exposed secrets or subdomains. Its persistence strongly suggests that this attack surface was either excluded from the assessment scope or insufficiently tested.</p><p>When a default, organization-wide credential persists across 53 publicly reachable assets, the failure is not merely procedural, it is architectural. The exposed surface was not a peripheral feature or isolated test environment. It was development infrastructure configured with privileges that would have granted access to private ArcGIS items shared within Flock Safety's organization.</p><h2>What You Can Do</h2><p><strong>If you're a resident:</strong> File a public records request for your city's Flock Safety contract and any internal audit logs. Attend the next city council meeting where surveillance procurement is discussed. The EFF maintains a <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/street-level-surveillance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Street-Level Surveillance</a> resource for tracking these deployments.</p><p><strong>If you're a journalist:</strong> The technical evidence presented here is a starting point. I'm available for follow-up. There are more threads to pull.</p><p><strong>If you're in law enforcement:</strong> Ask your vendor hard questions. Request their penetration test results. Demand to know where your agency's data lives and who else can access it. Your officers' safety depends on infrastructure that adversaries cannot trivially compromise.</p><p><strong>If you're a policymaker:</strong> Senator Wyden's letters to Flock and the FTC are public record. Support an investigation. Mandate independent security audits for any vendor handling law enforcement location data.</p><hr><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Although the API key has now been rotated, the lesson remains. If a single cybersecurity researcher in his early twenties could gain direct technical access to an exposure of this magnitude, a well-resourced foreign adversary operating with intent could observe far more.</p><p>Flock Safety did not merely leak an API key. They exposed the operational heartbeat of the nation, and they did so repeatedly, across 53 separate instances.</p><p>That reality should concern everyone.</p></div></div>]]></description>

I’d see some weird API error notification, login to my SendGrid account, check everything is working properly, and then delete the email. I didn’t pay too close attention to them until I saw a couple very strange ones. </p><p>Today, I received this one implying SendGrid was going to be adding a “Support ICE” button to all emails sent through their platform:</p></div><figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="939" height="1024" src="https://fredbenenson.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-09-at-7.54.28-AM-939x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://fredbenenson.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-09-at-7.54.28-AM-939x1024.png 939w, https://fredbenenson.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-09-at-7.54.28-AM-275x300.png 275w, https://fredbenenson.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-09-at-7.54.28-AM-768x837.png 768w, https://fredbenenson.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-09-at-7.54.28-AM-1409x1536.png 1409w, https://fredbenenson.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-09-at-7.54.28-AM.png 1730w" sizes="(max-width: 939px) 100vw, 939px"></figure><p><br>If you’ve been paying any attention at all to US politics, you’ll know how insidiuously provocative this would be if it were a real email.</p><p>But it isn’t. It’s a phishing email. If you use SendGrid, or have ever used it, you might be getting these too.</p><p>This phishing campaign is a fascinating example of how sophisticated  social engineering has become. Instead of Nigerian 419 scams, hackers have evolved to carefully craft messages sent to professionals that are designed to exploit the American political consciousness.</p><p>The opt-out buttons are the trap.</p><h2>The Attack</h2><p>Here’s how it works: hackers compromise SendGrid customer accounts (through credential stuffing, password reuse, the usual methods). Once they have access, they can send emails <em>through SendGrid’s infrastructure</em>, which means the emails pass all the standard authentication checks (SPF, DKIM) that your spam filter uses to determine legitimacy. The emails look real because, technically, they are real SendGrid emails sent via SendGrid’s platform and via a customer’s reputation –&nbsp;they’re just sent by the wrong people and wrong domains.</p><p>They’re likely using a list of SendGrid customers so they can target this to only people who have used the service before.</p><p>Security researchers at Netcraft dubbed this “<a href="https://www.netcraft.com/blog/popular-email-platform-used-to-impersonate-itself">Phishception</a>” back in 2024: attackers using SendGrid to phish SendGrid users, creating a self-perpetuating cycle where each compromised account can be used to compromise more accounts.</p><p>This has been going on for <em>years</em>. <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/08/sendgrid-under-siege-from-hacked-accounts/">Brian Krebs wrote about it in 2020</a>. And yet here we are.</p><h2>The Lures</h2><p>What’s changed, or at least what I’ve noticed recently, is the political sophistication of the bait. The attackers aren’t just sending “your account is suspended” emails (though they do that too).

They’re all legitimate businesses whose SendGrid accounts have been compromised. When these emails hit your inbox, they pass authentication because they really were sent through SendGrid, just not <strong><em>by</em></strong> SendGrid.</p><h2>Who’s Behind This?</h2><p>The political sophistication on display here (BLM, LGBTQ+ rights, ICE, even the Spanish language switch playing on immigration anxieties) suggests someone with a deep understanding of American cultural fault lines.</p><p>We know that state actors have invested heavily in understanding and exploiting these divisions. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_measures">Russian active measures</a> campaigns have been documented doing exactly this kind of work: identifying wedge issues and creating content designed to inflame both sides. North Korea has demonstrated similar sophistication in their social engineering operations by <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2023/Jun/01/2003234055/-1/-1/0/JOINT_CSA_DPRK_SOCIAL_ENGINEERING.PDF">targeting academics and foreign policy experts</a>.</p><p>I’m not saying this is a state actor necessarily – the economic value of exploiting SendGrid’s formidable email infrastructure is most likely the appeal here. Similarly, this could just as easily be a domestic operation run by someone who’s extremely online and knows which culture war buttons to push. But I think the skill set required (technical ability to compromise accounts at scale <em>plus</em> cultural fluency in American politics) is notable.</p><h2>Can This Be Fixed?</h2><p>Honestly? I don’t know.</p><p>SendGrid has known about this problem for years. Twilio (SendGrid’s parent company) has talked about requiring two-factor authentication for all customers, but implementation has been slow. The fundamental issue is that SendGrid’s business model depends on making it easy for legitimate businesses to send email at scale. Anything that adds friction for good actors also adds friction for bad actors, but the bad actors are more motivated to work around it.</p><p>Meanwhile, the attackers only need one thing: access to SendGrid customer accounts. As long as people reuse passwords and don’t enable 2FA, there will be a steady supply of compromised accounts. It’s a bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydra_effect">a hydra problem</a>: cut off one head, another grows behind it.</p><h2>Protecting Yourself</h2><p>If you’re a SendGrid customer: enable two-factor authentication immediately. Use a unique password. Check your account for unauthorized API keys or sender identities.</p><p>If you’re just receiving these emails: don’t click anything. The links go to fake SendGrid login pages that will steal your credentials in real-time as they actually validate your password against SendGrid’s API and even capture your 2FA codes.<br></p><h2>A Filter Hack</h2><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="978" height="1024" src="https://fredbenenson.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-978x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://fredbenenson.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-978x1024.png 978w, https://fredbenenson.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-287x300.png 287w, https://fredbenenson.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-768x804.png 768w, https://fredbenenson.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-1468x1536.png 1468w, https://fredbenenson.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image.png 1806w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 978px) 100vw, 978px"></figure><p><strong>For Gmail users</strong>, you can create a filter to automatically delete SendGrid impersonation emails that don’t come from legitimate SendGrid domains:</p><ol><li>Go to Settings → Filters and Blocked Addresses → Create new filter</li><li>In the “From” field, enter: <code>-from:sendgrid.com -from:twilio.com</code></li><li>In the “Has the words” field, enter: <code>sendgrid</code></li><li>Click “Create filter” and select “Delete it”</li></ol><p>This will catch emails that mention SendGrid but aren’t actually from SendGrid. It’s not perfect, but it helps.</p><h2>Have You Gotten These?</h2><p>I’m curious what other variations are out there. If you’ve received SendGrid phishing emails (especially weird or politically-charged ones) leave a comment or reach out. The more examples we document, the easier it is for people to recognize these when they land in their inbox.</p><p>And if you work at Twilio/SendGrid and want to explain what’s being done about this: I’m all ears.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://tombedor.dev/mcp-is-a-fad/">https://tombedor.dev/mcp-is-a-fad/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46552254">Hacker News</a></p>

<p>MCP has taken off as the standardized platform for AI integrations, and it's difficult to justify <em>not</em> supporting it. However, this popularity will be short-lived.</p>
<p>Some of this popularity stems from misconceptions about what MCP uniquely accomplishes, but the majority is due to the fact that it's <em>very easy</em> to add an MCP server. For a brief period, it seemed like adding an MCP server was a nice avenue for getting attention to your project, which is why so many projects have added support.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-mcp">What is MCP?<a href="#what-is-mcp" aria-label="Direct link to What is MCP?" title="Direct link to What is MCP?" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>MCP claims to solve the "NxM problem": with N agents and M toolsets, users would otherwise need many bespoke connectors.</p>
<h3 id="the-nxm-problem">The NxM problem<a href="#the-nxm-problem" aria-label="Direct link to The NxM problem" title="Direct link to The NxM problem" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>A common misconception is that MCP is <em>required</em> for function calling. It's not. With tool-calling models, a list of available tools is provided to the LLM with each request. If the LLM wants to call a tool, it returns JSON-formatted parameters:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="function_calling_no_mcp" src="https://tombedor.dev/assets/images/function_calling_no_mcp-3f3ed851f1398f52c8cb7d71d853261f.png" width="3499" height="749"></p>
<p>The application is responsible for providing tool schemas, parsing parameters, and executing calls. The problem arises when users want to reuse toolsets across different agents, since each has slightly different APIs.</p>
<p>For example, tools are exposed to <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/function-calling?example=meeting#rest_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gemini's API</a> via <code>functionDeclarations</code> nested inside a <code>tools</code> array:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>curl "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash:generateContent" \</span><br></span><span><span>  -d '{</span><br></span><span><span>    "contents": [...],</span><br></span><span><span>    "tools": [</span><br></span><span><span>      {</span><br></span><span><span>        "functionDeclarations": [</span><br></span><span><span>          {</span><br></span><span><span>            "name": "set_meeting",</span><br></span><span><span>            "description": "...",</span><br></span><span><span>...</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text?lang=curl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI's API</a>, tool schemas use a flat <code>tools</code> array with <code>type: "function"</code>:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>curl -X POST https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \</span><br></span><span><span>  -d '{</span><br></span><span><span>    "model": "gpt-4o",</span><br></span><span><span>    "input": [...],</span><br></span><span><span>    "tools": [</span><br></span><span><span>      {</span><br></span><span><span>        "type": "function",</span><br></span><span><span>        "name": "get_weather",</span><br></span><span><span>...</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is the "NxM" problem. In theory, users must build N × M connectors. In practice, the differences are minor (same semantics, slightly different JSON shape), and frameworks like <a href="https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/function_calling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LangChain</a>, <a href="https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/completion/function_call" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LiteLLM</a>, and <a href="https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/en/agents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SmolAgents</a> already abstract them away. Crucially, these options <em>execute tool calls in the same runtime as the agent</em>.</p>
<h3 id="how-mcp-addresses-it">How MCP addresses it<a href="#how-mcp-addresses-it" aria-label="Direct link to How MCP addresses it" title="Direct link to How MCP addresses it" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>MCP handles exposing and invoking tools via separate processes:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="function_calling_mcp" src="https://tombedor.dev/assets/images/function_calling_mcp-7ddac7e9d3439168d21fdd812a16c8b6.png" width="3633" height="1163"></p>
<p>A JSON configuration controls which MCP servers to start. Each server runs in its own long-lived process, handling tool invocations independently. The application still orchestrates the agent loop and presents results to users.</p>
<p>This abstracts away schema generation and invocation, but at a cost. Tool logic runs in a separate process, making resource management opaque. The application loses control over tool instructions, logging, and error handling. And every tool call crosses a process boundary.</p>
<h3 id="scope-tools-dominate">Scope: tools dominate<a href="#scope-tools-dominate" aria-label="Direct link to Scope: tools dominate" title="Direct link to Scope: tools dominate" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>MCP also defines primitives for prompts and resources, but adoption of these is much smaller than tools<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1-e0bb36" id="user-content-fnref-1-e0bb36" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>:</p>

<p>Given this, the rest of this post focuses on tool calling, which is MCP's primary use case in practice.</p>
<h2 id="problems">Problems<a href="#problems" aria-label="Direct link to Problems" title="Direct link to Problems" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The convenience of MCP comes with a price, stemming from two architectural attributes of an MCP-driven application:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="issues" src="https://tombedor.dev/assets/images/issues-aacc03230cf0cf8fc4fc94f2ba3c5876.png" width="1851" height="971"></p>
<p>Since tools are drawn from arbitrary sources, they are not aware of what other tools are available to the agent. Their instructions can't account for the rest of the toolbox.</p>
<p>The second issue stems from different toolsets having their own runtimes. This introduces a variety of problems I'll discuss below.</p>
<h3 id="incoherent-toolbox">Incoherent toolbox<a href="#incoherent-toolbox" aria-label="Direct link to Incoherent toolbox" title="Direct link to Incoherent toolbox" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/video/tool-space-interference-an-emerging-problem-for-llm-agents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agents tend to be less effective at tool use as the number of tools grows</a>. With a well-organized, coherent toolset, agents do well. With a larger, disorganized toolset, they struggle. <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI recommends keeping tools well below 20</a>, yet many MCP servers exceed this threshold.</p>
<p>Why does this happen? Consider a workflow in which an agent should send a notification after doing work:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="confusion" src="https://tombedor.dev/assets/images/confusion-00fa7e3d04a2eae3855e414829b16e58.png" width="2005" height="1001"></p>
<p>A tool's fit for a task depends not just on the job at hand, but also on what else is in the toolbox. Pliers can pull a nail, but if a hammer is available it's probably the better choice. When tools ship in isolation, their instructions can't say "use me only when you don't have a hammer," so agents don't get cohesive guidance.</p>
<p>If the toolset is controlled by the same authors as the application, they can add prompting to the toolsets to disambiguate when to use which tool. If not, the problem must be solved by system prompts or user guidance.</p>
<p>Looking through #mcp channels of open source coding agents, you'll invariably find users who struggle to get the agent to use the tools in the way they want<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2-e0bb36" id="user-content-fnref-2-e0bb36" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>:</p>

<p>Or, users complaining of how many tokens are burned by tool instructions:</p>

<p>Each MCP server <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/lifecycle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">starts a separate process</a> that survives for the length of the agent session.</p>
<p>Even in the healthy state, this introduces a collection of processes that remain mostly idle, aside from serving occasional requests from an agent. In an error state, we get all the usual headaches: dangling subprocesses, memory leaks, resource contention.</p>
<p>Users have these issues, if they are able to get the servers running at all: in support channels, the most common complaint is difficulty getting the servers to run:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="connection_problems" src="https://tombedor.dev/assets/images/connection_problem-7c5e6ede95ca4d7790b0caa5dd27d976.png" width="3196" height="668"></p>
<p>MCP offers no way for servers to declare their runtime/dependency needs. Some authors work around it by baking installation into the launch command (e.g., <code>uv run some_tool mcp</code>), which only succeeds if the user already has the right tooling installed.</p>
<p>Even if the relevant package is there, the MCP server might not start it successfully. MCP servers only inherit <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/legacy/tools/debugging#environment-variables" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a subset of parent ENV variables</a> (<code>USER</code>, <code>HOME</code>, and <code>PATH</code>). This is particularly problematic for <code>nvm</code> or users leveraging virtual environments.</p>
<p>Python or Node developers might be comfortable debugging environment issues, (although MCP's subprocess orchestration makes this more difficult), but are likely less comfortable debugging Node issues <em>and</em> Python <em>and</em> other runtimes. MCP seems to assert that I as the user should not really care which of these are used, or how many.</p>
<p>Even if toolsets are in one given runtime, MCP potentially spins up many instances of it, obviating efficiencies from caching, connection pooling, and shared in-memory state. MCP's HTTP transport mode doesn't help; it's just another HTTP API, but with MCP's protocol overhead instead of battle-tested REST/OpenAPI patterns.</p>
<h3 id="security">Security<a href="#security" aria-label="Direct link to Security" title="Direct link to Security" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>MCP pushes users to install servers from npm, pip, or GitHub. This inherits the usual supply-chain risk, but without even the minimal guardrails those ecosystems provide. There's no central publisher or signing; anyone can ship a daemon that runs on your machine and MCP offers no provenance check.</p>
<p>MCP's specification <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/mcp-security-network-exposed-servers-are-backdoors-to-your-private-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">doesn't mandate authentication</a>, leaving security decisions to individual server authors. The result: <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/2000-mcp-servers-security" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one scan found 492 MCP servers</a> running without any client authentication or traffic encryption. Even Anthropic's own Filesystem MCP Server had a sandbox escape via directory traversal (<a href="https://strobes.co/blog/mcp-model-context-protocol-and-its-critical-vulnerabilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CVE-2025-53110</a>).</p>

<p>Unlike a human carefully clicking through an API, agents can be manipulated via prompt injection to call tools in unintended ways. The <a href="https://www.generalanalysis.com/blog/supabase-mcp-blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supabase MCP leak</a> demonstrated this "lethal trifecta": prompt injection → tool call → data exfiltration, extracting entire SQL databases including OAuth tokens. Again, this risk isn't unique to MCP. But the best mitigations are existing security infrastructure: scoped OAuth tokens, service identities with minimal permissions, and audit logging. MCP sidesteps this infrastructure rather than building on it.</p>
<p>A common defense is that MCP isolates credentials—the agent talks to a socket, never seeing your API tokens. But this threat model is narrow: an agent that can invoke <code>mcp.github.delete_repo()</code> doesn't need your token to cause damage. You're not eliminating trust; you're redirecting it to third-party code that, as the CVEs demonstrate, is often unaudited and vulnerable.</p>
<h3 id="the-cost-benefit-doesnt-add-up">The cost-benefit doesn't add up<a href="#the-cost-benefit-doesnt-add-up" aria-label="Direct link to The cost-benefit doesn't add up" title="Direct link to The cost-benefit doesn't add up" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>These problems could be worth the cost, if we were to gain significantly. But comparing tool calling with MCP to tool calling without it, MCP handles remarkably little. MCP is, more or less, handling serializing function call schemas and responses.</p>
<p>The tools developers are saving themselves from having to write are, overwhelmingly, <a href="https://mcp.alphavantage.co/?utm_source=mcp.so&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=202508&amp;utm_id=000001&amp;utm_term=web_project&amp;utm_content=v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">relatively thin wrappers around API clients</a>, or <a href="https://mcp.so/server/time/modelcontextprotocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">utility scripts</a>. In the former case, users must still obtain API keys, billing accounts, and so on.</p>
<p>This code <em>was</em> a hassle to write, prior to the advent of coding agents. But these small utility scripts are the precise thing that coding agents excel most at! A technical user of MCP tools will be hard-pressed to find a tool an agent could not one-shot in the programming language they are most comfortable in.</p>
<h2 id="why-it-took-off">Why it took off<a href="#why-it-took-off" aria-label="Direct link to Why it took off" title="Direct link to Why it took off" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>With these issues, it's fair to wonder why MCP has gained the popularity it has. It has had lots of support from Anthropic, and no trouble gaining traction with toolset publishers, agent providers, and enterprises. Why? It helps narratives:</p>

<p>It's quite easy to publish an MCP server. The lack of startup requirements means you don't even need to publish to <code>npm</code> or <code>pip</code>: you can drop an <code>@mcp.server</code> annotation in your repo and host a small manifest JSON that points to your entry command (e.g., <code>node server.js</code>) and lists the tools.</p>
<p>This provides a nice narrative to gain attention to AI projects: A user can, in theory, easily add some MCP tools from a project, gain value, and follow interest in learning more about the project. Support overhead will, in the main, fall to agent maintainers.</p>
<p>Once publishers started appearing, it became difficult to justify <em>not</em> supporting MCP. Your project could be perceived as being against open standards.</p>
<h3 id="enterprise-ai-credibility">Enterprise: AI credibility<a href="#enterprise-ai-credibility" aria-label="Direct link to Enterprise: AI credibility" title="Direct link to Enterprise: AI credibility" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Over the last few years, anyone watching San Francisco billboards has witnessed enterprise tools rebranding toward AI. MCP support provided an easy way to make your e.g. project management tool be AI. The branding of MCP as an "open standard" increased pressure to adopt - lack of MCP support could signal a lack of willingness to adopt open standards.</p>
<h3 id="anthropic-open-source-credibility">Anthropic: Open source credibility<a href="#anthropic-open-source-credibility" aria-label="Direct link to Anthropic: Open source credibility" title="Direct link to Anthropic: Open source credibility" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>MCP's status as <em>the</em> open standard for AI and the enterprise adoption greatly benefited Anthropic. The big fear of investors is that enterprise adoption doesn't persist - adoption of Anthropic's open standard helped this.</p>

<p>There are a few different possible users who interact with MCP:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="users" src="https://tombedor.dev/assets/images/users-e233d38824dd614cca76cbe6a8e983f0.png" width="1077" height="722"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Technical end users</em> want to create tools and share them between different agents they might want to use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Non-technical end users</em> want to use different tools while using agents. Note that this user group for MCP is, at present, largely theoretical. Exposing toolsets to MCP involves editing JSON, making it out of reach for non-technical users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Internal app devs</em> run production AI applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Agent devs</em> create agents for external users. They wish to enable their end users to swap in whatever toolsets they like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Tool authors</em> create toolsets they wish to expose to users. MCP provides a way to easily share their work to users of different agents.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that the supposed beneficiaries are overwhelmingly technical. The "app store for AI" vision that would serve non-technical users remains unfulfilled.</p>
<p>For each user type, there's a simpler approach that avoids MCP's overhead:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>User Type</th><th>MCP Promise</th><th>Better Alternative</th><th>Why</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Technical end users</strong></td><td>Share tools between agents</td><td>Local scripts + command runner</td><td>AI can one-shot these scripts; works with any agent via shell; exposes tools to humans too</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Non-technical end users</strong></td><td>Easy tool installation</td><td><em>(MCP doesn't deliver)</em></td><td>MCP requires JSON editing—this group remains underserved regardless</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Internal app devs</strong></td><td>Standard tool interface</td><td>1st party tools</td><td>Same codebase, existing auth/logging/tracing, no process overhead, coherent toolbox</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Agent devs</strong></td><td>Let users swap toolsets</td><td>SDK abstraction (LangChain, LiteLLM)</td><td>Handles model API differences without separate processes</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Tool authors</strong></td><td>Distribute to all agents</td><td>OpenAPI specs or libraries</td><td>Existing distribution (npm, pip), decades of tooling, no new protocol</td></tr></tbody></table>
<h3 id="local-scripts-with-command-runner">Local scripts with command runner<a href="#local-scripts-with-command-runner" aria-label="Direct link to Local scripts with command runner" title="Direct link to Local scripts with command runner" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>For a technical user, letting an agent invoke scripts directly is very difficult to beat. Useful 50-100 line scripts are <em>extremely</em> easy to write with AI coding agents. Care needs to be taken to filter output - raw build scripts can stream verbose logs into agent context, eating up tokens.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="just" src="https://tombedor.dev/assets/images/just-c9e8594a50331d5b095b35a059dae448.png" width="1352" height="1171"></p>
<p>Robust security against agent actions going haywire can be achieved via command runners like <a href="https://github.com/casey/just" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">make</a>. These tools provide everything that MCP does - command specifications, descriptions, arguments. Agents allow you to specify what command prefixes can be invoked without approval - put your agent commands in a <code>justfile</code>, and only auto-allow shell commands prefixed with <code>just</code>.</p>
<p>This approach also exposes tools to humans, and is a nice approach for improving dev environments for humans and AI agents at the same time. (See <a href="https://tombedor.dev/make-it-easy-for-humans/">Make It Easy for Humans First, Then AI</a> for more on this).</p>
<h3 id="1st-party-tools">1st party tools<a href="#1st-party-tools" aria-label="Direct link to 1st party tools" title="Direct link to 1st party tools" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>For a self contained application, there is little reason to separate tool codebases from the codebase for the rest of the application. Tools can be dynamically exposed to the agent based on application context.</p>
<p>In a first party context, any code that devs wish to reuse can be exposed as libraries, just like any other code they wish to share. An AI tool is really nothing more than a function, and the fact that it's invoked by AI does not warrant special handling.</p>
<p>An enterprise context should have robust infrastructure for authenticating, authorizing, provisioning service identities, and tracing call chains for service to service calls. That some of these calls are now <em>AI</em> service to service calls does not warrant a rebuilt security posture.</p>
<h3 id="openapi--rest">OpenAPI / REST<a href="#openapi--rest" aria-label="Direct link to OpenAPI / REST" title="Direct link to OpenAPI / REST" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>OpenAPI specs are already self-describing enough for agents—they include operation descriptions, parameter schemas, examples, and enums. LLMs understand them well; GPT Actions are literally OpenAPI specs. The glue needed between an OpenAPI endpoint and an agent (output filtering, context, auth) is the same glue MCP requires. MCP doesn't provide meaningfully better tool descriptions; it just reinvents a schema format that already exists, without the decades of tooling, validation, and battle-testing.</p>
<h2 id="a-prediction">A prediction<a href="#a-prediction" aria-label="Direct link to A prediction" title="Direct link to A prediction" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>MCP's popularity will be relatively short-lived. The cost benefit does not add up, and there are readily available alternatives. The introduction of <a href="https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claude Skills</a> and <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/12/openai-skills/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAI's quick adoption</a> signal that even model providers agree.</p>
<p>Claude Skills is an incremental improvement over MCP, but is similarly overengineered. Longstanding tools and techniques for collaboration amongst human devs remain compelling, and these options will chip away at more AI-centric techniques which reinvent the wheel.</p>

<p>It seems to have been advertised as a world-changing advancement. Was it just oversold? Was it another JVM applet scenario, doomed to fail?</p>
<p>I’d like to tackle this in a weirdly roundabout way because I think these sorts of questions make a few misplaced assumptions that are critical to clarify.</p>
<h2 id="in-the-real-world">In The Real World</h2>
<p>Of course, WebAssembly <strong>does</strong> see real-world usage. Let’s list some examples!</p>
<ul>
<li>Godot uses WebAssembly to <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/development/compiling/compiling_for_web.html">build games for the web</a>.</li>
<li>Squoosh.app uses WebAssembly to <a href="https://web.dev/blog/squoosh-v2#new_codecs_support">make use of image libraries</a>.</li>
<li>Zellij uses WebAssembly for its <a href="https://zellij.dev/documentation/plugins#plugins">plugin ecosystem</a>.</li>
<li>Figma uses WebAssembly to <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/webassembly-cut-figmas-load-time-by-3x/">convert their C++ code</a> to something usable in a browser</li>
<li>Stackblitz uses WebAssembly for <a href="https://blog.stackblitz.com/posts/introducing-webcontainers/">their web containers</a>.</li>
<li>Ruffle uses WebAssembly to run <a href="https://ruffle.rs/">a flash emulator</a> in your browser</li>
</ul>
<p>For many of these, WebAssembly is critical to either their entire product or a major feature.</p>
<p>But I think this alone is not very convincing. We don’t yet see major websites entirely built with <a href="https://github.com/yewstack/yew">webassembly-based frameworks</a>. We’re not building our applications directly to WebAssembly for maximum portability. But why not?</p>
<p>To answer this, we need a good mental model for what WebAssembly is. This will help us qualify where it is most impactful and the limitations we’re up against.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-webassembly">What Is WebAssembly</h2>
<p>In a word, WebAssembly is a language.</p>
<h2 id="a-note-on-speed">A Note On Speed</h2>
<p>This makes questions like “how fast is WebAssembly” a bit hard to answer. You don’t ask how fast algebraic notation is—it’s not a very sensible question.</p>
<p>Taken in the context of something like JavaScript, the language is only as fast as the engine running it. JavaScript the language has no speed, but you can benchmark JS engines like V8, SpiderMonkey, and JavaScriptCore. You can benchmark the IO libraries of JS runtimes like Bun, Deno, and Node.</p>
<p>What people actually mean is “how useful are the constructs of this language to efficient mappings of modern hardware” and “what is the current landscape of systems taking advantage of these constructs”.</p>
<p>Through clever-enough engineering, you can make any system sufficiently fast with some trade-offs. If compiling your code directly to C doesn’t bother you, getting “near native” speeds is possible in both <a href="https://hermesengine.dev/">JavaScript</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/blob/main/Wasm2c/README.md">WebAssembly</a>.</p>
<p>That’s right, you can compile WebAssembly! You can also choose to interpret it directly—that’ll be up to your runtime, just like every other system.</p>
<p>So let’s ask the actual question of WebAssembly: how useful are the constructs of this language to efficient mappings of modern hardware? Turns out, pretty useful!</p>
<h2 id="an-efficient-mapping">An Efficient Mapping</h2>
<p>WebAssembly is a pretty close approximation of an assembly language. Not too close, mind you. It’s higher level than that. But it’s close enough to cleanly compile to most assembly languages without a significant speed trade-off.</p>
<p>And yes, you can write WebAssembly by hand! I made a rustlings-esque course called <a href="https://github.com/EmNudge/watlings/">watlings</a> where you can hand-write WAT to solve some basic exercises.</p>
<p>WAT is a very close approximation to Wasm. It is <strong>almost</strong> 1:1 in that you can compile WAT to Wasm and then back to WAT with barely any loss in information (you may lose variable names and some metadata). It looks like this:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="clojure"><code><div><p><span>(</span><span>module</span></p></div><div><p><span>  </span><span>;; import external i32, name it $global_num_import</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>(</span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>"env"</span><span> </span><span>"global_num"</span><span> (</span><span>global</span><span> $global_num_import i32))</span></p></div><div><p><span>  </span><span>;; A function that adds param $a to $global_num_import, returns i32</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>(</span><span>func</span><span> $add_to_global_num (</span><span>param</span><span> $a i32) (</span><span>result</span><span> i32)</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>;; The last stack value is the return value</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>    </span></span><span>(</span><span>i32.add</span><span> (</span><span>local.get</span><span> $a) (</span><span>global.get</span><span> $global_num_import))</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>)</span></p></div><div><p><span>  </span><span>;; export local function, name it add_to_global</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>(</span><span>export</span><span> </span><span>"add_to_global"</span><span> (</span><span>func</span><span> $add_to_global_num))</span></p></div><div><p><span>)</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>Try reading the code. It will feel both familiar and foreign.</p>
<p>We have functions and S-expressions. We have imports and exports. But we also have instructions like <code>i32.add</code> and implicit stack returns.</p>
<p>Wasm is a bytecode perhaps best compared to <em>JVMIS</em> (i.e. JVM bytecode). They have similar goals and constraints, but different landscapes and guarantees.</p>
<p>Compared to JVM bytecode, Wasm has a significantly smaller API and stronger safety guarantees. It has fewer opinions on your memory management strategy and more limitations on what your program can do without permission from its host environment.</p>
<p>It can crunch numbers, but must be explicitly provided its memory and all imports. In this way, it is much different from an actual assembly language (or, a more widely used one).</p>
<p>We’ll wrap back around to this later.</p>
<h2 id="a-compilation-target">A compilation target</h2>
<p>You can compile many languages to Wasm.</p>
<p>Notable among them are Rust, C, Zig, Go, Kotlin, Java, and C#. Commonly interpreted languages have even had their runtimes compiled to WebAssembly, such as Python, PHP, and Ruby. There are also many languages that solely compile to WebAssembly, such as <a href="https://www.assemblyscript.org/">AssemblyScript</a>, <a href="https://grain-lang.org/">Grain</a>, and <a href="https://www.moonbitlang.com/">MoonBit</a>.</p>
<p>For many of these, it is important not to require a garbage-collector. For others, it would be helpful to include one. Wasm allows for both (with the GC option being much more recent).</p>
<p>Your browser includes a Wasm “engine”, making this doubly an attractive compilation target. This means without much setup, your phone and laptop can run Wasm programs already.</p>
<p>Like how JVM can have many implementations of its runner, there are many implementations that run independently of your browser such as <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/Wasmtime">Wasmtime</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge">WasmEdge</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Wasmerio/Wasmer">Wasmer</a>.</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="bash"><code><div><p><span>$</span><span> </span><span>Wasmer</span><span> </span><span>run</span><span> </span><span>cowsay</span><span> </span><span>"I am cow"</span></p></div><div><p><span> </span><span>__________</span></p></div><div><p><span>&lt;</span><span> I am cow </span><span>&gt;</span></p></div><div><p><span> </span><span>----------</span></p></div><div><p><span>        </span><span>\</span><span>   </span><span>^__^</span></p></div><div><p><span>         </span><span>\</span><span>  (oo)</span><span>\_</span><span>______</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>            </span></span><span>(</span><span>__</span><span>)</span><span>\</span><span>       )</span><span>\/\</span></p></div><div><p><span>               </span><span>||</span><span>----w</span><span> </span><span>|</span></p></div><div><p><span>                </span><span>||</span><span>     </span><span>||</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>These languages can output a single artifact without being too specific to your computer’s hardware. You only need a Wasm runner to execute it (note more JVM analogies).</p>
<h2 id="security-and-what-it-enables">Security and what it enables</h2>
<p>Right now, Wasm is looking really similar to JVM. The main differences seem to be around memory management strategies and how many platforms support it.</p>
<p>The security story is what really starts to drive in the wedge.</p>
<p>WebAssembly maintains a minimal attack surface by treating all external interactions as explicit, host-defined imports. We went over this earlier. Its “deny-by-default” architecture, small instruction set, hidden control-flow stack (i.e. no raw pointers), and linear memory combine to create a <strong>very strong</strong> security story.</p>
<p>It is such that you can ensure process-like isolation within a single process. Cloudflare takes advantage of this aspect within V8 to run untrusted code very efficiently <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/mitigating-spectre-and-other-security-threats-the-cloudflare-workers-security-model/">using V8 isolates</a>. This means significant efficiency gains without significant security trade-offs.</p>
<p>Wasm programs can start 100x faster if you can avoid spinning up a separate process. Fermyon, a company in the Wasm hosting space, advertises <a href="https://www.fermyon.com/serverless-guide/speed-and-execution-time">sub-millisecond spinup times</a>.</p>
<p>In these cases, the performance is a direct result of what the security guarantees enable.</p>
<p>In other cases, security can unlock feature support.</p>
<p>Flash is a multimedia platform that was primarily used for animations and games up until it was dropped from all major browsers in January of 2021 (primarily) due to security concerns. <a href="https://ruffle.rs/">Ruffle</a> has revived Flash experiences on sites like <a href="https://www.notion.so/What-Happened-To-WebAssembly-aa6295c947a24fc48de2a31378ced53b?pvs=21">Newgrounds</a> by acting as an interpreter and VM for ActionScript.</p>
<p>Cloudflare allows running Python code with similar security guarantees to its JS code by using <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/">Pyodide</a>, which is a Wasm build of CPython.</p>
<p>Figma runs untrusted user plugins in your browser by running them in <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-we-built-the-figma-plugin-system/">a QuickJS engine that is compiled to Wasm</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the security allows for extreme embeddability.</p>
<h2 id="portability-and-embeddability">Portability and Embeddability</h2>
<p>We’ve gone over the number of ways you can run Wasm programs. A Wasm runner can be pretty light. Instead of forcing library authors into a specific language (usually Lua or JavaScript), supporting Wasm itself opens the door to a much wider set of choices.</p>
<p>Tools like <a href="https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij">Zellij</a>, <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/">Envoy</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/lapce/lapce">Lapce</a> support Wasm for their plugin ecosystem.</p>
<p>In environments where a JavaScript engine is already being used, this means access to programs you would not have been able to run otherwise.</p>
<p>This includes <a href="https://github.com/kleisauke/Wasm-vips">image processing</a>, <a href="https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js">ocr</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js">physics engines</a>, <a href="https://skia.org/docs/user/modules/canvaskit/">rendering engines</a>, <a href="https://ffmpegwasm.netlify.app/">media toolkits</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js">databases</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/blob/master/lib/binding_web/README.md">parsers</a>, among many others.</p>
<p>In a majority of these cases, the use of Wasm will be transparent to you. A library you installed will just be using it somewhere in its dependency tree.</p>
<p>Godot and Figma have codebases written in C++, but are often browser-ready by compiling to (or in combination with) WebAssembly.</p>
<p>It seems the most common use of Wasm is bridging the language gap. Certain ecosystems seem to have suites of tools more common to them. <a href="https://squoosh.app/">Squoosh</a> would be a much more limited application if it could only choose image compression libraries from NPM.</p>
<h2 id="speed-and-size-revisited">Speed and size revisited</h2>
<p>Browsers run WebAssembly with roughly the same pipeline that runs JavaScript. This seemingly puts a hard limit on the performance of Wasm applications, but they will often be more or less performant due to their architecture or domain.</p>
<p>Using languages with richer type systems and more sophisticated optimizing compilers can produce more efficient programs. The JIT model of engines like V8 might prevent optimizations if the cost of optimizing exceeds the gains from running the optimized code. You might avoid <a href="https://mrale.ph/blog/2015/01/11/whats-up-with-monomorphism.html">megamorphic functions</a> more easily by avoiding JavaScript.</p>
<p>However, there is a cost to crossing the host-program boundary, especially if cloning memory. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31214521">Zaplib’s post-mortem</a> is an interesting read here. Incrementally moving a codebase to Wasm can incur significant costs in boundary crossing, eliminating any benefit in the short term.</p>
<p>A small API surface also means binary bloat as system APIs are more often re-created than imported. There are standards like <a href="https://wasi.dev/">WASI</a> which aim to help here. Still, there is no native string type (<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/stringref">yet</a>).</p>
<p>Zig seems to produce the smallest Wasm binaries among mainstream languages.</p>
<p>Practical performance of Wasm in native contexts (i.e. outside of a JS engine) seems to suffer for a variety of reasons. Threading and IO of any sort incurs some cost. Memory usage is larger. Cold start is slower.</p>
<p>Still, the performance trade-offs might not be significant enough to matter. For most uses, I’d wager it’s “fast enough”. If you’re in a performance-sensitive context, the benefits of Wasm are likely not as relevant.</p>
<h2 id="language-development-and-you">Language development and you</h2>
<p>Clearly things are happening.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Wasmio">Wasm IO YouTube channel</a> has lots of talks worth watching.</p>
<p>In fact, standards and language development in Wasm has stirred significant controversy internally. There is a lot of desire for advancement, but standardization means decisions are hard to reverse. For many, things are moving too quickly and in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>There is the “more official” <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/Wasm/">W3C working group</a> and then the “less official” <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance">Bytecode Alliance</a> which works much more quickly and is centered around tooling and language development outside of Wasm directly (e.g. on <a href="https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/design/wit.html">WIT</a> and the <a href="https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/">WebAssembly Component Model</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://webassembly.org/features/">Wasm feature proposals</a> are being quickly advanced and adopted by a wide suite of tools. This is remarkable progress for standardization, but is also scary to watch if you fear large missteps.</p>
<p>So why do people think nothing has happened?</p>
<p>I figure most are under the impression that the advancement of this technology would have had a more visible impact on their work. That they would intentionally reach for and use Wasm tools.</p>
<p>Many seem to think there is a path to Wasm replacing JavaScript within the browser—that they might not need to include a <code>.js</code> file at all. This is very unlikely.</p>
<p>However, you can use frameworks like <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor">Blazor</a> and <a href="https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos">Leptos</a> without being aware or involved in the produced JS artifacts.</p>
<p>Mostly, Wasm tools have been adopted and used by library authors, not application developers. The internals are opaque. This is fine, probably.</p>
<p>Separately, I think the community is not helped by the philosophy of purposely obfuscating teaching material around Wasm. This is a fight I lost a few times.</p>
<p>For now, maybe check out <a href="https://github.com/EmNudge/watlings">watlings</a>. I’ll expand it at some point, surely.</p>  </article></div>]]></description>

<p>The European Commission has <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/16213-European-Open-Digital-Ecosystems_en">opened</a>
a "<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=intcom%3AAres%282026%2969111">call
for evidence</a>" to help shape its European Open Digital Ecosystem
Strategy. The commission is looking to reduce its dependence on
software from non-EU countries:</p>

<blockquote>
The EU faces a significant problem of dependence on non-EU countries
in the digital sphere. This reduces users' choice, hampers EU
companies' competitiveness and can raise supply chain security issues
as it makes it difficult to control our digital infrastructure (both
physical and software components), potentially creating
vulnerabilities including in critical sectors. In the last few years,
it has been widely acknowledged that open source – which is a public
good to be freely used, modified, and redistributed – has the strong
potential to underpin a diverse portfolio of high-quality and secure
digital solutions that are valid alternatives to proprietary ones. By
doing so, it increases user agency, helps regain control and boost the
resilience of our digital infrastructure.
</blockquote>

<p>The feedback period runs until midnight (Brussels time)
February&nbsp;3, 2026. The commission seeks input from all interested
stakeholders, "<q>in particular the European open-source community
(including individual contributors, open-source companies and
foundations), public administrations, specialised business sectors,
the ICT industry, academia and research institutions</q>".</p><br clear="all"><hr>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hey everyone,
​I’ve been reading the text of the "NO FAKES Act" currently in Congress, and it’s worse than I thought.
​The Tldr: It creates a "digital replica right" for voices/likenesses. That sounds fine for stopping deepfake porn, but the liability language is a trap. It targets anyone who "makes available" a tool that is primarily used for replicas.<br>
​The Problem: If you release a TTS model or a voice-conversion RVC model on HuggingFace, and someone else uses it to fake a celebrity, you (the dev) can be liable for statutory damages ($5k-$25k per violation).
​There is no Section 230 protection here. This effectively makes hosting open weights for audio models a legal s*icide mission unless you are OpenAI or Google.</p>

<p>What I did:
I contacted my reps email to flag this as an "innovation killer." If you run a repo or care about open weights, you might want to do the same. We need them to add a "Safe Harbor" for tool devs.</p>

<p>S.1367 - 119th Congress (2025-2026): NO FAKES Act of 2025 | Congress.gov | Library of Congress <a href="https://share.google/u6dpy7ZQDvZWUrlfc">https://share.google/u6dpy7ZQDvZWUrlfc</a></p>

<p>UPDATE: ACTION ITEMS (How to actually stop this)
​If you don't want to go to jail for hosting a repo, you need to make noise now.
​1. The "Lazy" Email (Takes 30 seconds):
Go to Democracy.io or your Senator’s contact page.
​Subject: Opposition to NO FAKES Act (H.R. 2794 / S. 1367) - Open Source Liability
​Message: "I am a constituent and software engineer. I oppose the NO FAKES Act unless it includes a specific Safe Harbor for Open Source Code Repositories. The current 'Digital Fingerprinting' requirement (Section 3) is technically impossible for raw model weights to comply with. This bill effectively bans open-source AI hosting in the US and hands a monopoly to Big Tech. Please amend it to protect tool developers."
​2. The "Nuclear" Option (Call them):
​Call the Capitol Switchboard: (202) 224-3121
​Ask for Senators Wyden (D) or Massie (R) if you want to thank them for being tech-literate, or call your own Senator to complain.
​Script: "The NO FAKES Act kills open-source innovation. We need a Safe Harbor for developers who write code, separate from the bad actors who use it."</p>

<div><p>Yes, you can use this with any text file and file extension to send file content to Claude Code with unix-like pipe support.

<div><p>I agree that script execution safety is a real concern, as it is with AI coding tools generally. By default the runnable markdown files do not have permission to execute code, unless you specifically add those permissions.</p><p>I can see there might be valid arguments for enforcing file type associations for execution at the OS level. These are just text files, and Unix-like environments support making text files executable with a shebang as a universal convention.</p><p>I am a fan of that unix-like philosophy generally: tools that try to do a single thing well, can be chained together, and allow users to flexibly create automations using plain text. So I tried to stick with that approach for these scripts.</p><p>I'm a bear of little brain, and prompt engineering makes my head hurt. So part of the motivation was to be able to save prompts and collections of prompts once I've got them working, and then execute on demand. I think the high readability of markdown as scripts is helpful for creating assets that can be saved, shared and re-used, as they are self-documenting.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46556345"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="2"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td><center><a id="up_46556345" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46556345&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46549444"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>The ability to execute code is not granted as part of the directory permissions. By default the scripts will not be able to execute code, only run analysis and text gen tasks.

<div><p>At the moment, it looks like Claude Code does not support using ‘temperature’ or ‘seed’ flags.

<div><p>I think I get the idea... but why not officially create a new file type altogether?</p><p>Not only it would avoid any confusion (Markdown wasn't meant to be executable?) but it would allow future extensions in a domain that is moving fast.</p><p>The recent incident (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46532075">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46532075</a>) regarding Claude Code's changelog shows that pure Markdown can break things if it is consumed raw.</p><p>Also, regarding:

<div><p>Another format is an interesting idea. This tool will work with any text file content and file extension. So you could create another text-based format yourself and use it in theory.</p><p>I think the reasons Markdown is appealing include:</p><p>- It's just a text file.</p><p>- LLMs like Claude have high comprehension of the format, so Claude Code does very well with it.</p><p>- You can mix structured and unstructured text, and code with plain language: YAML frontmatter, outline/headings, code blocks, tables, links and images etc.</p><p>I used a heavily condensed version of the example prompt that Pete Koomen posted about as a simplified example, so that's really just me cutting it back to the most simple form of the concept.</p><p>In real-use it would be detailed, verbose and specific, and include the actual code blocks and external shell script references to retrieve and execute. So this really is just a proof of concept to give an idea of the sort of thing that people could create in future.</p><p>I know lots of us developers joke about getting the sack and losing out to AI. But for what it's worth, the sorts of points you raise are exactly why I think skilled developers become even more valuable than ever with AI.</p><p>Programming will change massively this next decade. But it has many times even in my life. So I'm definitely in the camp that thinks this is a new programming abstraction level, and Claude Code and Codex and others are useful tools that improve the productivity of skilled coders. Especially when they are used carefully and thoughtfully.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46554663"><td></td></tr><tr id="46555656"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="2"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td><center><a id="up_46555656" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46555656&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46549444"></a></center></td><td><br>

And to Claude Code, Codex themselves.</p><p>claude-run is just a bunch of little convenience scripts, but for it to work effectively with code execution, the handling needs to do a little more than just `cat` the file output, for example stripping shebang lines, supporting flags and permissions and a few other things.

<div><p>My view is that readability and ease of understanding have a real impact on auditability. Nondeterministic output also clearly has a significant impact on auditability.</p><p>The balance between readability and determinism for auditability partly relates to developer philosophy. Tech is famous for religious arguments. I have friends who hate AI coding, and want to avoid nondeterminstic tools at all costs. And other friends whose productivity has increased significantly, and who see the future of programming as natural language.</p><p>The quality of AI models and tools like Claude Code is improving fast, and there are many developers who find value in them, myself included. I built this to make life easier for developers who want to use AI tools for automation.</p><p>I find it much faster to parse and understand plain language than many code scripts I've seen. It was one of Python's great insights that people spend more time reading code than writing it. And there is a tradeoff in auditability between determinism and the ability to quickly read and understand what systems do.</p><p>There are clearly many people who find AI useful, and who are becoming skilled in its use as a tool. This is just a little tool that I put together for myself and other people who fall in that basket.</p><p>Learning where to use AI tools appropriately - how to constrain the dangers while maximizing the value - is part of the challenge. From using this particular tool for real work, it fits some use cases well, and can make things easier both to understand and share, as well as to write.</p><p>I hope it's useful for some other people wanting to use AI for scripting and automation.</p><p>I think that quickly understandable instructions are part of auditability. Not the whole thing, and their use needs to be balanced with safety and security. But an important part of it.</p><p>I accept there are plenty of folks who don't see AI tools that way. We're sharing this for people who see the value in this new approach, even though it is a fast-moving field and there are a lot of imperfections.</p><p>Any reasonably competent Claude Code user who is careful about setting permissions boundaries is no more going to delete their hard drive than a competent command line user would. There will be things that go wrong with AI, as before it.</p><p>In years of tech support, I've personally had to help people who neutered their Windows install or deleted files they needed. Those things happen and I'd argue they come down to skill issues, with AI or without. New tools have a learning curve.</p><p>I get that you think that's bizarre to see readability with AI-based tools as more auditable, and I really do understand that perspective.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46549769"><td></td></tr><tr id="46549894"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="2"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td><center><a id="up_46549894" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46549894&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46549444"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>In practice after using this for real-world test suites and evaluations, the results with Claude Code if you do this sensibly are remarkably consistent. That's because you can still write the deterministic parts as the `./run_tests.sh` bash script (or `run_tests.py` etc).</p><p>So you're using the appropriate tools for the task at hand embedded within both traditional scripts and markdown scripts.</p><p>Examples:
- A bash script summarizes text files from a path in a loop
- A markdown script runs `./test/run_tests.py` and summarizes the results.</p><p>Tools like Claude code combined with executable scripts and pipes open up a genuinely new way of doing tasks that are traditionally hard with scripting languages alone.

    <p>After almost 18 years, I left iNaturalist, the product and organization I helped create. I left because I don’t believe the current Leadership team is pointing the product in the right direction, and I don’t think they are managing their talented staff in an empathetic or effective way. If you’d like me to continue working on natural history software, <a href="https://patreon.com/kueda?utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=why-i-left-inat&amp;utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&amp;utm_content=support-me-on-patreon"><strong>support me on Patreon</strong></a>.</p>

<p>This post is an announcement for those who were unaware, an explanation for those who are confused, and a record so I don’t forget.</p>

<h2 id="some-history">Some History</h2>
<p>I wanted to build something like iNat shortly after I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2003. In 2007 I attended the UC Berkeley School of Information and built it along with my fellow students and co-founders <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/people/5">Nate Agrin</a> and <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/people/2">Jess Kline</a>. Nate and I worked on it a bit in our spare time after graduating, and I started collaborating with <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/people/477">Scott</a> in 2009, still in our spare time. Scott was instrumental in recruitment, funding, and collaboration, and we formed an <abbr title="Limited Liabilty Corporation">LLC</abbr> together as a way to have a bank account to accept funds to build out functionality like the first iPhone and Android apps. In 2014 we joined the California Academy of Sciences (<abbr title="California Academy of Sciences">CAS</abbr>) in the hope of gaining access to more resources to hire more staff, which we did and thus survived almost a decade of growth in usage. In 2023 we left <abbr title="California Academy of Sciences">CAS</abbr> after arduous negotiations and formed an independent non-profit.</p>

<p>Up to this point, iNat functioned as an unstructured anarchy. Scott and I were titular “co-directors” but we did not provide a lot of direction and most of the big moves and features were driven largely by individual initiative. We never found a great way to collaborate. We struggled to set collective goals that might override individual ones, we struggled to keep longer-term goals in mind amid day-to-day firefighting, and we remained merely the sum of our parts, if that. Toward the end of our time at <abbr title="California Academy of Sciences">CAS</abbr> we experimented with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociocracy">sociocracy</a> as a way to organize without hierarchy and coercion, but despite my enthusiasm for the form, we didn’t start with universal buy-in or understanding from the whole team, we didn’t fully adopt its structures, and, like many democracies before us, we ultimately voted to abolish our own democracy when we formed the “leadership circle” and created a hierarchy.</p>

<p>The leadership circle was me, Scott, and <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/people/7580">Carrie</a>. We didn’t have clearly-defined roles, but our mandate was navigating the separation from <abbr title="California Academy of Sciences">CAS</abbr> while forming a new organization, which meant lots of talking with lawyers, understanding the requirements of tax-exempt status, forming a new board and writing its bylaws. I had very little interest in any of it and to my discredit, I let Carrie and Scott do most of the work. When we did need to make decisions, I was generally the minority, e.g. in how much to disclose in our negotiations with <abbr title="California Academy of Sciences">CAS</abbr> (<abbr title="in my opinion">IMO</abbr> everything) or whether board members should be required to donate money (<abbr title="in my opinion">IMO</abbr> no, plutocracy is bad at all times and at all levels). In addition to constantly feeling like the losing vote, the “leadership circle” was sliding into becoming a Leadership team of department heads, and being a dis-empowered leader of people doing the actual work wasn’t what I wanted, so I stepped down and was officially just an engineer, work I’d been doing all along anyway.</p>

<p>The new mobile app (which we were calling “iNat Next” and is now simply “iNaturalist,” the older app becoming “iNaturalist Classic”… still following? I’m going to refer to them as “iNat Next” and “iNat Classic” for clarity) was proving to be more work than the team dedicated to it could handle, so I put all of my time into that. We hired two new staff to work on it, and did our best to reconcile what little guidance we got from Leadership with an internal process focused on discussion and consent. By late 2024, the app wasn’t what anyone wanted it to be, but we had soft-launched on iPhone and were iteratively improving. At this point Leadership started establishing arbitrary goals like a hard launch with promotion in time for City Nature Challenge 2025 with the hopes of getting featured in the Apple App Store. They insisted the app needed to be simpler, to cater first to incidental users who wanted a quick answer, to be a friction-less path to a feeling of contribution. I don’t believe that’s possible while also serving existing users who value (don’t laugh) the power and nuance of iNat, including, among many other things, the way it <em>doesn’t</em> give you a quick answer, forcing you to consider options when making an identification. At this point it was clear to me Leadership wanted the app to be something I had no interest in using and that I didn’t believe would serve people like me, and that they were totally uninterested in hearing feedback from the team developing it, so I left and joined the web team.</p>

<p>Over that spring, Leadership changed direction on iNat Next again and again, shifting the baseline for what constituted a viable feature set for release and driving the team toward a deadline for getting featured in the App Store that ultimately proved fruitless when the app wasn’t featured after all. The team felt dis-empowered and Leadership seemed unwilling to listen to their complaints. Some of the team asked if I could do anything, so I tried to do what seemed like the only thing I could do in a hierarchy and communicate the problems up to the Head of Engineering and Head of Engagement (early March 2025), but there was likewise no change in behavior from Leadership in the way they managed the mobile team. I ultimately proposed restructuring product Leadership under a new Head of Product role with the explicit responsibility of consulting with workers and with users about their needs and capabilities, working closely with design and engineering staff to ensure that no one was blindsided by sudden changes in direction but also ensuring no team was left without product direction (17 April 2025). I proposed that this role have independent control over product decisions to resist impulses from the rest of Leadership to override existing priorities before work could be tested by use. I also proposed that I could do the job.</p>

<p>A day later, Leadership informed me they had no intention of adopting my proposal (“We’re not planning to change the Head of Product structure at this time,” 18 April 2025, referring the three-member sub-group of the Leadership team that was making product decisions at the time). A few days after that Scott announced that he was taking on an additional role to his Executive Director responsibilities: Head of Product (circa 21 April 2025). On 5 May 2025, the Leadership team summoned everyone who worked on iNat Next into an agenda-less meeting titled “post launch Strategic alignment” and announced that they would offer us half a year’s pay to quit. Offended and incensed that they would rather so many staff leave than listening to and addressing their concerns, I decided iNaturalist was no longer an organization I wanted to work for and I told them to write up the offer. I consulted with friends and advisors, who all suggested that I take longer to decide, perhaps on a sabbatical. Leadership agreed to that, so I tried to spend the last few months thinking about whether I could remain in an organization led by people in whom I have lost so much faith. In the interim, most of the recipients of that buyout offer left the organization, as well as another engineer, and the Head of Engineering, resulting in a 30% attrition in staff. The org is trying to fill that gap with the three new engineers that have been hired for the mobile team, former board member <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/people/181">Dan Rademacher</a> joining staff as Head of Product (though not, apparently, with the independence I proposed, so responsibility without the necessary power), and hiring two more engineers for the web/ops team (in progress, to my knowledge).</p>

<p>As I was leaving, the Google gen AI debacle happened, a fiasco big enough to merit description in <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/google-ai-grant-to-inaturalist-prompts-community-outcry/">Scientific American</a>. This was an own goal. iNat’s Engagement team predicted the backlash but the Leadership team chose not to listen to their warning. I was not involved in this grant, its announcement, or its fulfillment, but while it didn’t directly lead to my own choice to leave, it is symptomatic of the problems that led to that choice, and I think it played a role convincing more staff to quit. In my discussions with staff since, almost everyone recalled being blindsided by the announcement of the grant and confused about what the money was going to be used for.</p>

<h2 id="product">Product</h2>
<p>My fundamental difference from Leadership in terms of the organization’s products is that I think different products should meet different needs, while the Leadership team believes a single product can meet all the needs of the organization’s potential users (I have many others differences, but this might be the least reconcilable). At the beginning of iNat, I thought one product could meet all those needs too. In grad school, we described personas of potential users and quickly identified the divide in needs between enthusiast naturalists and people with a more occasional interest in nature, and we tried to design to meet the needs of both groups of people. Again and again over the years, I saw that we just couldn’t do it. Enthusiasts need power and complexity that is immediately confusing and intimidating to more casual users, and that extends from the use of scientific names through the kinds of filters you can use to explore the data. Casual users need structure and guidance to invite them into the amazing but complex and often unfamiliar world of biodiversity, but that structure can be a hindrance or even infantilizing to people who just want to get things done. iNaturalist the product is fundamentally complicated, and I have watched many, many people bounce off that wall of complexity over the years, even as I’ve seen so many people enrich their lives after they climb over it.</p>

<p>The last nail in the coffin on this subject for me was Seek, an idea from <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/people/44845">Alex</a> and <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/people/79343">Joelle</a> (later rebuilt by <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/people/1132118">Amanda</a> and <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/people/247291">Abhas</a>) to build a version of iNat <em>specifically</em> for that casual crowd, focused on quick answers with a gamified structure. Seek was wildly successful, eventually equaling and occasionally exceeding the usage of the iNaturalist apps. Two critical anecdotes: I remember looking for rare plants in a burn zone and overhearing two young botanists one hill over trying to figure out a plant and eventually saying, “well let’s just see what Seek says.” I was alarmed that these professionals were using such an unprofessional tool, but also reminded that in that moment, they didn’t need iNat-level complexity. They just needed a Seek-sized nudge in their identification process. One summer a year or two later I went home for my annual family vacation and my dad told me he’d just discovered the marvels of Seek and was puttering around everywhere seeing what Seek thought of the plants in the yard. Dad has been a meticulous recorder of information his entire life, and has been a loyal iNat contributor for years, but he has never had much interest in computers and absolutely couldn’t give a toss about connecting with other people on the Internet, so Seek really worked for him in a way iNat never did.</p>

<p>iNat’s history and Seek’s success prove to me that my initial belief in a single app to meet all needs was wrong: iNat the product should serve the enthusiast users, and Seek should serve the casual users. Arguments about Seek eating into iNat’s potential usage are absurd: the mission of the organization is to connect people to nature through technology, and if two products are doing that better than one product, that’s success. If Seek users aren’t contributing to a global data set, that’s also fine. Data generation has always been a byproduct of building connection. Seek could be better about encouraging data contribution, but it doesn’t need to.</p>

<p>iNat’s current Leadership does not share this belief. To them, Seek is an off-brand liability that they don’t intend to improve. They think iNaturalist the product can serve those Seek users while also serving existing core iNat contributors to the detriment of neither.</p>

<h2 id="management">Management</h2>
<p>Leadership made many mistakes over the last year, including</p>

<ol>
  <li>Failing to listen to the concerns of the mobile team in the development of iNat Next and overriding their decisions</li>
  <li>Abandoning product direction on the web team and for Seek</li>
  <li>Trying to address discord by jettisoning staff instead of addressing their concerns</li>
  <li>Accepting a grant without any consultation with staff about how its obligations might be met</li>
  <li>Ignoring staff warnings about how the announcement of that grant would not go over well with users</li>
</ol>

<p>I lay the departure of 30% of staff at their feet, primarily because of the buyout offer. I think that showed the entire organization that their bosses are the kind of people who deal with criticism with a firm shove out the door. Yes, the people who left may have had other opportunities, but they primarily left because they were not being consulted when they had feedback, not getting help when they needed it, and not granted the level of independence they needed to get things done. The reputational damage from the Google AI grant was similarly due to Leadership’s inability to hear and digest criticism. If they had listened to the warnings of the Engagement team, it might have gone down very differently.</p>

<p>Since the exodus, Leadership has improved on some fronts. Within the Engagement and Engineering teams they are consulting with staff more than they have in the past. Within Engagement that consultation seems to be translated into action more than it has in the past. They hired three new engineers for the mobile team that seem both experienced and enthusiastic. Bringing Dan into a Head of Product role will hopefully provide more empathy and clarity to the engineering teams.</p>

<p>But fundamentally for me, even if Leadership has learned something from their mistakes, they have not learned to admit them, which proves to me they haven’t really learned to accept criticism. There has been no all-staff discussion about stumbling through the release of iNat Next, of the Google gen AI debacle, or, most importantly, why 30% of staff left the organization in three months. The mistakes of the Leadership team are partially or totally to blame for these events, and if they do not own their responsibility before staff and before the community, I don’t think they deserve their power. They certainly don’t deserve my trust.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next</h2>

<p>First of all, I quit. I can’t work with a Leadership team that has such a different vision for where iNat the product needs to go and how iNat the organization should be managed. Or if I can, I can’t find satisfaction while doing so.</p>

<p>I’d like to keep working on natural history software, and if you’d like me to as well, <a href="https://patreon.com/kueda?utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=why-i-left-inat&amp;utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&amp;utm_content=support-me-on-patreon"><strong>support me on Patreon</strong></a>. In a perfect world, I’d be employed by the people who use the software I make, so I figured I’d try it. Right now I’m working on <a href="https://github.com/kueda/chuck">a way to back up your iNat observations</a> and an <a href="https://underfoot.rocks/">app for viewing geologic maps</a>. Both could use a lot of work. In the future I’d like to experiment with a decentralized version of iNat. In all likelihood I’ll need to get a “real” job so <a href="mailto:work@kueda.net">let me know</a> if you’d think you’d like to hire me.</p>

<p>I am, of course, heartbroken. I genuinely like almost everyone on staff and I will miss working with them. It would be hard to find a more talented, bright, and perceptive group of people, and they genuinely care about iNat and are trying to do right by it, which makes it all the more tragic that the organization can’t seem to do right by them.</p>

<p>To those who are mystified by a co-founder’s choice to leave the thing they co-founded, I don’t really care about the fact that I helped create iNat (it was not a unique idea), but I very much care about it existing in something like its present form because I use it every day, interact with people like me on it every day, and it hurts to step away from an active role in improving and maintaining it.</p>

<p>Obviously, I think the Leadership team should change, and maybe they will. Hiring Dan is a good step, but I think they will need more fundamental changes to their approach to right the ship, starting with learning how to admit when they’re wrong.</p>

<p>I also think the board should change, because they are either complicit in Leadership’s mistakes or failing in their oversight function. I think the board should develop lines of communication with staff and users outside of the Leadership team. We set up iNat’s board to be largely non-interventionist, but I think that was a mistake. Now they only get information from a Leadership team that cannot admit fault. If the board is really to perform its oversight function, it should be hearing from staff and users more directly.</p>

<p>I also think the board should follow Wikimedia’s lead and commit to a <a href="https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Legal:Wikimedia_Foundation_Bylaws#(F)_Overall_Board_composition.">majority of community-selected members</a>, instead of selecting their own membership from people like them. Users should have more power in the organization. Right now they’re barely even informed about what staff are doing.</p>

<p>In case anyone is alarmed about the state of iNat after reading this, I do not advise stopping your use of iNat, and I definitely don’t advise deleting your account. I’m certainly not doing either. I was appalled at the number of people who went nuclear and deleted their accounts during the gen AI debacle. Temporarily withdrawing your data would be a reasonable form of protest if it was possible, but destroying existing data that can’t be retrieved hurts everyone. If you think iNat has problems, either the ones I’ve described or others, I think you should keep contributing observations, identifications, and if you can, donations, <em>but</em> also organize. Users don’t currently have any effective control over staff or the board, but you do control the life blood of iNat: participation. A large enough cessation of data or money would exert pressure, but it would take organization.</p>

<p>If you’re concerned, I’d also advise exploring or creating alternatives. While I don’t think iNat has reached Doctorow-level <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittification</a>, it does suffer from centralization. If you don’t like the way your data is used to train <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> models, you can’t currently move your data to a non-<abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> service while still contributing to and using iNat data, even if such a service existed. But you should be able to do that. It also suffers from stagnation. If you want features like client-side geofencing, video support, sonograms, sound <abbr title="identification">ID</abbr>, etc, you might need to build them. iNat still maintains the web 2.0 virtue of <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability">adversarial interoperability</a> in the form of its <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>, so some of these alternatives can be built in non-competitive ways (and if the <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> goes away, we’ll know things have gotten really bad), but some may require competition. Those of us who benefit from tools like iNat should be looking seriously to the decentralized models being developed by the likes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT_Protocol">Bluesky</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">Mastodon</a>, because we can’t rely on any single organization to provide that benefit forever.</p>
