Regatta Storage is a new cloud file system that provides unlimited pay-as-you-go capacity, local-like performance, and automatic synchronization to S3-compatible storage. For example, you can use Regatta to instantly access massive data sets in S3 with Spark, Pytorch, or pandas without paying for large, local disks or waiting for the data to download.</p><p>Check out an overview of how the service works here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xh1q5p7E4JY" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xh1q5p7E4JY</a>, and you can try it for free at <a href="https://regattastorage.com/">https://regattastorage.com</a> after signing up for an account. We wanted to let you try it without an account, but we figured that ‚ÄúHacker News shares a file system and S3 bucket‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt be the best experience for the community.</p><p>I built Regatta after spending nearly a decade building and operating at-scale cloud storage at places like Amazon‚Äôs Elastic File System (EFS) and Netflix. During my 8 years at EFS, I learned a lot about how teams thought about their storage usage. Users frequently told me that they loved how simple and scalable EFS was, and -- like S3 -- they didn‚Äôt have to guess how much capacity they needed up front.</p><p>When I got to Netflix, I was surprised that there wasn‚Äôt more usage of EFS. If you looked around, it seemed like a natural fit. Every application needed a POSIX file system. Lots of applications had unclear or spikey storage needs. Often, developers wanted their storage to last beyond the lifetime of an individual instance or container. In fact, if you looked across all Netflix applications, some ridiculous amount of money was being spent on <i>empty storage space</i> because each of these local drives had to be overprovisioned for potential usage.</p><p>I tried to evangelize EFS, but I got consistent pushback. Other engineers told me that NFS was slow or chatty and couldn‚Äôt deliver adequate performance for their applications. Most of these applications were transferring data from S3 for analysis, and then uploading some set of results. Using EFS as the backing storage system meant that the teams would need to ‚Äúclean up‚Äù this temporary data when the jobs were done.</p><p>At this point, I realized that there was a missing solution in the cloud storage market which wasn‚Äôt being filled by either block or file storage, and I decided to build Regatta.</p><p>Regatta is a pay-as-you-go cloud file system that automatically expands with your application. Because it automatically synchronizes with S3 using native file formats, you can connect it to existing data sets and use recently written file data directly from S3. When data isn‚Äôt actively being used, it‚Äôs removed from the Regatta cache, so you only pay for the backing S3 storage. Finally, we‚Äôre developing a custom file protocol which allows us to achieve local-like performance for small-file workloads <i>and</i> Lustre-like scale-out performance for distributed data jobs.</p><p>Under the hood, customers mount a Regatta file system by connecting to our fleet of caching instances over NFSv3 (soon, our custom protocol). Our instances then connect to the customer‚Äôs S3 bucket on the backend, and provide sub-millisecond cached-read and write performance. This durable cache allows us to provide a strongly consistent, efficient view of the file system to all connected file clients. We can perform challenging operations (like directory renaming) quickly and durably, while they asynchronously propagate to the S3 bucket.</p><p>We‚Äôre excited to see users share our vision for Regatta. We have teams who are using us to build totally serverless Jupyter notebook servers for their AI researchers who prefer to upload and share data using the S3 web UI. We have teams who are using us as a distributed caching layer on top of S3 for low-latency access to common files. We have teams who are replacing their thin-provisioned Ceph boot volumes with Regatta for significant savings. We can‚Äôt wait to see what other things people will build and we hope you‚Äôll give us a try at regattastorage.com.</p><p>We‚Äôd love to get any early feedback from the community, ideas for future direction, or experiences in this space. I‚Äôll be in the comments for the next few hours to respond!</p></div></td></tr>        <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently, my team and I fixed an absolutely bizarre bug that only one person in the team could reproduce. And to make it even weirder, she was only able to reproduce the issue when using her work laptop at home; it worked fine with the same laptop in the office.</p><h2 id="heading-so-what-was-the-bug">So what was the bug?<a href="#heading-so-what-was-the-bug"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>The BBC's UK website uses a <code>click</code> event to respond to when a user activates the 'More' button. <code>click</code> events aren't just activated by the click of a mouse; they can also be activated by touch and the 'enter' or 'space' keys on a keyboard.</p><p><img src="https://www.joshtumath.uk/images/2024-11-08-bbc-global-nav.png" alt="Screenshot of BBC global navigation bar opened using the 'more' button." loading="lazy" width="792" height="280"></p><p>Our 'more' button should open a menu. However, when she was clicking on it at home, the <code>click</code> event didn't seem to do anything. Instead, the menu opened using our no-JavaScript fallback behaviour.</p><p><em>That's strange.</em> üí≠</p><p>When we looked into it a bit more, we found out that the bug only happened when her web browser window was on one of her external monitors. She had two external monitors and it happened on both. But when she clicked the button on her laptop screen, the button worked as expected.</p><p><em>What?</em> ü§Ø</p><p>And to make it even stranger, the bug didn't happen in Safari.</p><p><em>What? What? What?</em> ü§Ø ü§Ø ü§Ø</p><p>So why on earth was something like a user's external monitor set up affecting <code>click</code> events on our website? And why was this bug not happening to everyone else in our team who used an external monitor? It was very strange indeed.</p><h2 id="heading-reproducing-the-issue">Reproducing the issue<a href="#heading-reproducing-the-issue"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>We wanted to be able to reproduce the bug to properly investigate it, so we needed to understand what it was in her home environment that triggered it.</p><p>Since the bug only occurred on her external monitors, we noticed that it stopped if she repositioned them in the OS settings. Her external monitors were positioned above her laptop, so once we replicated that arrangement in our OS settings, we were finally able to reproduce the bug, too.</p><p><em>Bingo!</em></p><p><img src="https://www.joshtumath.uk/images/2024-11-08-multi-monitor-negative.png" alt="Screenshot of macOS display settings. Second monitor is shown arranged top left of the built-in laptop monitor." loading="lazy" width="1516" height="916"></p><h2 id="heading-our-investigation">Our investigation<a href="#heading-our-investigation"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>We had two clues to begin our investigation:</p><ul><li><strong>1st clue:</strong> <mark>The bug didn't occur on Safari</mark>.</li><li><strong>2nd clue:</strong> <mark>The bug only happened when the external monitors were positioned above and left of the main monitor</mark>.</li></ul><p>Our next step was to investigate our 'more' button's <code>click</code> event handler function.</p><p>While reproducing the issue, a <code>console.log</code> of our 'more' button's click event showed our <strong>3rd clue:</strong> that, <mark>on Chrome and Firefox, the <code>screenX</code> and <code>screenY</code> properties were negative numbers</mark>.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong><br>Even though they can be triggered by any kind of input, <code>click</code> events are a type of <code>PointerEvent</code>, so their <code>event</code> objects include information about the mouse or touch pointers that trigger the clicks. For example, the <code>screenX</code> and <code>screenY</code> properties show the coordinates (in pixels) for what point on the screen gets clicked on.</p></blockquote><p>That surprised me, because I didn't know those properties were allowed to have negative numbers. I checked the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#dom-mouseevent-screenx">DOM UI Events spec</a> to see if that was correct, but there didn't seem to be any specific information about it.</p><p>With some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwzOhHFGZKw">Ace Attorney Investigations-style logic</a>, when we put together the fact that <mark>the bug didn't occur on Safari</mark> and that, <mark>on Chrome and Firefox, the <code>screenX</code> and <code>screenY</code> properties were negative numbers</mark>, we could deduce that browsers have an interoperability issue in how they represent screen coordinates in multi-monitor set ups.</p><p><img src="https://www.joshtumath.uk/images/2024-11-08-aai-logic.gif" alt="Animation of the logic sequence in Ace Attorney Investigations. The player picks from clues to connect and the game shows if they successfully connected." loading="lazy" width="400" height="225"></p><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong><br>I ended up reporting the interoperability issue to the WebKit team on <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=281430">WebKit bug 281430</a>.</p></blockquote><p>That knowledge gave rise to our <strong>4th clue:</strong> <mark>the bug only occurred if <code>screenX</code> and <code>screenY</code> were negative</mark>.</p><p>With some more Ace Attorney Investigations-style deductions, when we combined that with our 2nd clue ‚Äì that <mark>the bug only happened when the external monitors were positioned above and left of the main monitor</mark> ‚Äì we could deduce our <strong>5th clue:</strong> <mark>on Chrome and Firefox, the <code>screenX</code> and <code>screenY</code>'s (0,0) coordinate is the top left of the main monitor</mark>.</p><p>On a multi-monitor set up, browsers' screen coordinate systems treat multiple monitors as if it were one big monitor. So two 800px wide monitors positioned horizontally would have <em>x</em> coordinates ranging of 0 to 1600. On Safari, that range is always a positive number starting from the top left most monitor, but it looks like, in Chrome and Firefox, they are relative to the main monitor instead and use negative coordinates.</p><p>We needed to find the <code>click</code> event handler in our code and see how it was reading the <code>screenX</code> and <code>screenY</code> coordinates from the <code>event</code> object.</p><p>This is what we found:</p><pre><code><span><span>const</span> <span>isInvokedByMouse</span> <span>=</span> <span>event</span> <span>=&gt;</span> event<span>.</span>screenX <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span> <span>||</span> event<span>.</span>screenY <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span></span><br><span><span>const</span> <span>isInvokedByKeyboard</span> <span>=</span> <span>event</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>isEnterKey</span><span>(</span>event<span>)</span> <span>||</span> <span>isSpaceKey</span><span>(</span>event<span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>// ...</span></span><br><span></span><br><span><span>const</span> <span>toggleMenu</span> <span>=</span> <span>event</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>isInvokedByMouse</span><span>(</span>event<span>)</span> <span>||</span> <span>isInvokedByKeyboard</span><span>(</span>event<span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span></span><br><span>    event<span>.</span><span>preventDefault</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span><br><span></span><br><span>    <span>// Do stuff to open the menu...</span></span><br><span>  <span>}</span></span><br><span><span>}</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>The <code>isInvokedByMouse</code> was checking whether the <code>click</code> event was invoked by a mouse or touch pointer ‚Äì rather than a keyboard ‚Äì by checking if the <code>screenX</code> or <code>screenY</code> coordinates were a positive number.</p><p>That gave us our <strong>final clue:</strong> <mark>the code assumes <code>click</code> events invoked by pointers have positive <code>screenX</code> and <code>screenY</code> coordinate numbers</mark>.</p><p>When a user clicked the 'more' button on a monitor with negative screen coordinates, the event handler wasn't acknowledging the click and instead falling back to the default behaviour of the 'more' button.</p><p>We could finally finish our investigation. We could deduce from our final two clues the solution: <strong>we need to check for negative numbers as well as positive numbers when checking the <code>screenX</code> and <code>screenY</code> coordinates.</strong></p><h2 id="heading-the-fix">The fix<a href="#heading-the-fix"><span> permalink</span></a></h2><p>As is often the case with bugs, the problem was very complex to figure out, but the solution was very simple.</p><p>All we had to do was change the <code>isInvokedByMouse</code> to check that <code>screenX</code> and <code>screenY</code> don't equal 0, rather than checking if they are greater than 0.</p><pre><code><span><span>const</span> <span>isInvokedByMouse</span> <span>=</span> <span>event</span> <span>=&gt;</span></span><br><span>  event<span>.</span>type <span>===</span> <span>'click'</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>(</span>event<span>.</span>screenX <span>!==</span> <span>0</span> <span>||</span> event<span>.</span>screenY <span>!==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></span></code></pre><p>Now everyone with weird multi-monitor layouts can enjoy the BBC website's navigation bar in peace.</p><p>We should probably do further refactoring of the event handler function, since it's complicated by the fact that it also handles <code>keydown</code> events. For now, though, this fix will do just fine.</p><p>So that was fun! Who would have thought web developers could break an experience for users because of which monitor they're viewing the page on?</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Bhutanese wear different clothes and construct buildings in a traditional architectural style. The culture remains strong today.&nbsp;</p><p>"We came to realize that, you know, that what we had in the past, what is old, is actually very valuable," Dorji said.&nbsp;</p><p>Bhutan was, and is today, largely a subsistence agricultural society. Many families still live in multigenerational farmhouses.&nbsp;</p><p>The country was unified by the man who became its first king in 1907. His sons and grandsons ‚Äî who are referred to in Bhutan as the second, third, fourth and today, fifth, kings ‚Äî have reigned since.&nbsp;</p><h2>Bhutan's unique path to modernity&nbsp;</h2><p>It was Bhutan's fourth king who, as a young, newly-crowned ruler in the 1970s, set Bhutan onto its path toward modernity. Jigme Singye Wangchuck, on his way home from a summit of nonaligned nations in Cuba, landed at an airport in India, where journalists asked him what Bhutan's gross national product was.&nbsp;</p><p>"And the king said, 'Actually, in Bhutan, gross national happiness is much more important to us than gross national product,'" Dorji recounted.&nbsp;</p><p>The phrase stuck and attracted international attention. Maximizing Gross National Happiness became a primary responsibility of Bhutan's government, led today by Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay.&nbsp;</p><figure><span><img src="https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/727e4435-f3d3-4a51-809e-3cf4e292c734/thumbnail/620x349/8f087cf03f1f013345d8d653f7746036/tshering-tobgay.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898#" alt="Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay " height="349" width="620" data-srcset="https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/727e4435-f3d3-4a51-809e-3cf4e292c734/thumbnail/620x349/8f087cf03f1f013345d8d653f7746036/tshering-tobgay.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898 1x, https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/727e4435-f3d3-4a51-809e-3cf4e292c734/thumbnail/1240x698/79d51679c662135e7f143e3f82dc1a2a/tshering-tobgay.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20349'%2F%3E"></span>

              </figcaption></figure><p>"Gross National Happiness acknowledges that economic growth is important, but that growth must be sustainable. It must‚Ä¶ be balanced by the preservation of our unique culture," Tobgay said. "People matter. Our happiness, our well-being matters. Everything should serve that."</p>

    
    

<p>Every five years, surveyors fan out across Bhutan measuring the nation's happiness. The results are analyzed and factored into public policy.&nbsp;</p><p>"Gross National Happiness does not directly equate to happiness in the moment. One happiness is fleeting, it is emotion, it is joy," Tobgay said.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ancient-traditions-of-bhutan-60-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Experiencing Bhutan's ancient and wondrous traditions</a></li></ul><p>The other ‚Äî the kind Bhutan is focused on, Tobgay said ‚Äî is contentment, being happy with life and oneself.&nbsp;</p><p>It's also about nature. By law, at least 60% of the country must remain under forest cover. And with most of its energy coming from hydroelectric power, Bhutan was the first and remains today one of the only countries in the world to be carbon negative.&nbsp;</p><p>It earns foreign revenue selling excess hydropower to India and from tourism, but there are limits. The country is full of gorgeous mountains, but summiting mountain peaks isn't allowed.&nbsp;</p><p>"For a Bhutanese, it's very easy to understand: You know, the mountains are sacred," Dorji said.&nbsp;</p><p>School is taught in English and it's free, as is health care.&nbsp;</p>

    
    

<p>And though the country has a king, Bhutan is also a democracy.&nbsp;</p><h2>Introducing Bhutan to democracy</h2><p>A quarter century after introducing Gross National Happiness, the fourth king decided the best thing for his country would be to have an elected parliament and a prime minister.&nbsp;</p><p>"[It's] the only country where<span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bhutans-reluctant-road-to-democracy/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""> democracy was introduced</a></span> in a time of peace and stability, where democracy was literally gifted, imposed on the people, not just gifted, because the people didn't want it," Tobgay said.&nbsp;</p><p>As a reporter, Dorji covered the king's travels throughout Bhutan as he held meetings called consultations to discuss the idea with his subjects. Dorji remembers people begging the king not to institute a democracy.&nbsp;</p><figure><span><img src="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/b2cae4c3-688f-43f7-8e18-40853ca5c714/thumbnail/620x349/59c32fa71bd725415ffa8d50e8c1daf9/bhutan-king.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898#" alt="Bhutan's king with Lesley Stahl " height="349" width="620" data-srcset="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/b2cae4c3-688f-43f7-8e18-40853ca5c714/thumbnail/620x349/59c32fa71bd725415ffa8d50e8c1daf9/bhutan-king.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898 1x, https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/b2cae4c3-688f-43f7-8e18-40853ca5c714/thumbnail/1240x698/4f57142cc6e241bc794c077fd92af141/bhutan-king.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20349'%2F%3E"></span>

              </figcaption></figure><p>"Because when they looked around the world, their horizon was India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan: Democracy," Dorji said. "Which is really synonymous with violence, with corruption. So they said, 'No, thank you. We don't really need that. We are fine.'"</p><p>The king was not swayed by their arguments, arguing in response that a leader chosen by birth and not by merit might one day lead the country to disaster. Then, at just 51, he abdicated and passed the crown to his 26-year-old son, the fifth and current king. Bhutanese headed to the polls for the first time ever in 2008.</p><p>Today the fifth king is 44. He is adored in the country and works closely with the prime minister.&nbsp;</p>

    
    

<h2>So why are young Bhutanese leaving the country in record numbers?</h2><p>Bhutan is currently facing what is known in the country as a crisis of outmigration. The COVID-19 pandemic hit Bhutan's economy hard, shutting down tourism. Recovery has been slow.&nbsp;</p><p>Many Bhutanese, with their excellent English, found higher-paying jobs in Australia, even doing menial labor. Word of opportunities spread fast on social media and now a devastating 9% of the country's population, most of them young people, have left.&nbsp;</p><p>"This is a very difficult situation for Bhutan," Tobgay said.&nbsp;</p><h2>Luring people back with a City of Mindfulness&nbsp;</h2><p>Bhutan's government has mobilized, with the king launching a bold, high-stakes plan to lure people back. Prime Minister Tobgay is trying to attract more business and tourists to Bhutan, highlighting landmarks like a centuries-old suspension bridge, part of an ancient 250-mile trail from one end of the country to the other that is now open to trekking tourists.&nbsp;</p><p>But tourism can only do so much and Bhutan's king knows it, so he has decided to create a new city in southern Bhutan with different rules from the rest of the country. It will be an attempt at a new model of robust economic development, while still holding true to Bhutanese values.&nbsp;</p><p>The king is calling it the Gelephu Mindfulness City.&nbsp;</p><p>He turned to Danish architect <span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-architect-bjarke-ingels-billion-dollar-designs/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Bjarke Ingels</a></span> to design it. The new city will have neighborhoods nestled between the area's many rivers, connected by a series of unusual bridges. The bridges will also act as public buildings, with one home to a Buddhist center, another to health care facilities and yet another a university. There won't be any skyscrapers, and everything will be built with local materials.&nbsp;</p><figure><span><img src="https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/83e9902a-0af2-4703-ba66-aa05a79e22fa/thumbnail/620x349/37163192d257b344a8547e5e1f3fd5b4/bjarke-ingels.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898#" alt="Danish architect Bjarke Ingels " height="349" width="620" data-srcset="https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/83e9902a-0af2-4703-ba66-aa05a79e22fa/thumbnail/620x349/37163192d257b344a8547e5e1f3fd5b4/bjarke-ingels.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898 1x, https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/83e9902a-0af2-4703-ba66-aa05a79e22fa/thumbnail/1240x698/39653bcb18ca41cea483029b47028571/bjarke-ingels.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20349'%2F%3E"></span>

              </figcaption></figure><p>Right now, the area ‚Äî located in Bhutan's lowlands ‚Äî is largely undeveloped. Dr. Lotay Tshering, a former prime minister whom the king has tapped to lead the new city, said it will be built in phases over the next two decades, with no polluting industries allowed.&nbsp;</p>

    
    

<p>The area is also home to a lot of wildlife, including elephants. The new city will have wildlife corridors to protect the animals.&nbsp;</p><p>The king has said the success of the project will shape the future of Bhutan.&nbsp;</p><p>"When we say we follow the principles of Gross National Happiness, we do not mean we are happy with less‚Ä¶ We also want to be rich. We also want to be technologically high standard," Dr. Tshering said. "We want Bhutanese to be heading multi-million dollar companies, multinational companies."</p><p>A Bhutanese team is collaborating with experts around the world, seeking investors to help build the city, the cost of which is likely to run in the billions. The city will have its own legal framework modeled on Singapore's and will run on clean hydroelectric power, with the hope of drawing technology companies, especially AI.</p><h2>Deciding to stay</h2><p>Ingels presented his plans to the king, and the king then presented them to the nation, last December.&nbsp;</p><p>Namgay Zam, a journalist who used to anchor Bhutan's nightly newscast, was in attendance. She'd been in the middle of planning a move to Australia with her family when she went to hear the king that day at a packed stadium.</p><p>"He did what no king had done before. He asked the people to help him directly. And he said, 'Will you help me?' And there was shocked silence," Zam said. "Even for me, I froze. And I was like, 'Did he just ask us to help him?' And then he said, 'Will you help me,' a second time."</p><figure><span><img src="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/e84f401b-809e-4d11-9999-78b317954be7/thumbnail/620x349/7c2e479d49acdca1e85261eee9a228f6/namgay-zam.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898#" alt="Namgay Zam " height="349" width="620" data-srcset="https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/e84f401b-809e-4d11-9999-78b317954be7/thumbnail/620x349/7c2e479d49acdca1e85261eee9a228f6/namgay-zam.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898 1x, https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/11/15/e84f401b-809e-4d11-9999-78b317954be7/thumbnail/1240x698/67661abb73cbb1500e9f4defac53f065/namgay-zam.jpg?v=cc5700e8049ccc64c4e0272313675898 2x" srcset="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg'%20viewBox%3D'0%200%20620%20349'%2F%3E"></span>

<p>"I came home and I told my husband, 'We can't leave,'" Zam said. "And he said, 'Why?' And I said, 'I've signed a social contract with his majesty, because I said yes.'"</p><p>Zam and her husband did not go to Australia, but the king and his family did. He visited the country last month to bring his vision for the new Gelephu Mindfulness City and the future of Bhutan to packed stadiums of more than 20,000 Bhutanese who live in Australia now, all in the hopes of one day luring them back home.&nbsp;</p><p>"If we succeed, we can show that you can create a city that does not displace nature, that is anchored and rooted in the local heritage and culture, and that still allows for growth and prosperity to happen," Ingels said. "That is a struggle a lot of places in the world are struggling with."</p>

<h2>Also known as: why you shouldn‚Äôt trust a company who makes their product intensionally inaccessible with allowing you an accessibility workaround</h2>



<p>Update: I‚Äôve been informed that hCaptcha now has a text captcha option. The bulk of this blog post still stands. Thanks to D Hamlin for the correction. Also thanks to T Spivey for pointing out my capitalization error causing eloquence users to just hear captcha. This has also been fixed. It‚Äôs been a while, hasn‚Äôt it? Well I‚Äôm back again with a long overdue blog post. Once again, it‚Äôs a warning of something crazy. Seems I‚Äôm good at coming up with blog posts for those lol. Anyway, let‚Äôs get on with it</p>



<p>I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve seen the hCaptcha captcha service, where you check a box and then need to select all images of a house or whatever. If you‚Äôre not aware, they intensionally do not provide an audio captcha version for the blind since they say this would make it easier for bots to get through. Instead, they provide a special account for blind people that allows them to get a cookie which lets them get past the captcha without a challenge‚Ä¶</p>



<p>This should be warning sign umber one. If they‚Äôre intensionally making their captcha inaccessible, then why should you trust them with an accessibility workaround. What happens when they decide that the accessibility workaround is causing too much of a headache? What happens when bots start using it to get past the captcha for free? We‚Äôll be partially discussing that today, though in a slightly different context.</p>



<p>Anyway, I mainly use brave browser for my browsing needs, and for about a year, my accessibility account just wouldn‚Äôt set the cookie on brave. I followed all the steps, third party cookies were allowed, etc, but the cookie just would not set. It worked great on firefox, chromium, and everything else I tried. The message just said that if this keeps occurring that I should email support. So finally I did email support.</p>



<p>They walked me through basic troubleshooting steps, most of which I had already tried, and in an attempt to isolate the problem and help out their technical staff, I mentioned that the call to their set cookie endpoint seemed to be returning a 401 unauthorized code in brave, looking at the javascript console. This, I think, made them a little suspicious, even though I was only trying to help them out.</p>



<p>So imagine my surprise, when out of nowhere in the middle of my conversation with a support rep named Gemma, another rep named Mel sends a reply and says</p>



<pre>Hello,
                                                                                                                                
This is not a supported use, and you are not being credited for accessibility passes.
                                                                                                                                
All accounts being used in this way will be deleted from hCaptcha, and the users banned if they attempt to sign up again for
accessibility.
                                                                                                                                
Thanks,
hCaptcha Support
</pre>



<p>I was obviously very confused, as I wasn‚Äôt doing anything they didn‚Äôt allow, I was just trying to get it working under brave. So I emailed back, and they clarified that since I wasn‚Äôt blind, I shouldn‚Äôt be using the accessibility account.</p>



<p>Excuse me? I‚Äôm not blind? Are you serious?</p>



<p>I have no idea what got that idea through their heads, but I verified that my account had indeed been banned. I emailed back a day or so later, requesting an unban because, y‚Äôknow, I *actually* am blind, but they gave a pretty canned response of no, your account is remaining banned.</p>



<p>So the end result is that, irony of all ironies, if I want to get past hCaptcha, I have to break their terms of service and use an automated solving program to solve the captcha, all because they decided, randomly, that I wasn‚Äôt blind, so can‚Äôt use their accessibility account.</p>



<p>Consider this a warning that, if you rely on a workaround to an intensionally inaccessible system to make it useable, you‚Äôre just waiting for something to go wrong.</p>



<p>I can‚Äôt stress this enough. Don‚Äôt trust a company that makes their product intensionally inaccessible to provide an accessibility work around. That‚Äôs like a zebra trusting a lion who eats zebras to not eat them out of the kindness of their heart. It‚Äôs a ticking timebomb.</p>



<p>Please share this post with your friends, and if you know any webmasters who use hCaptcha, consider forwarding this to them. It‚Äôs not ok what they‚Äôre doing, and it‚Äôs affecting real people. I was going to reach out to Cloudflare to share my experience in an attempt to get them to drop hCaptcha, but apparently they‚Äôre using an in house system now anyway. Good riddance, I say.</p>



<p>Anyway, consider this a warning, and maybe I won‚Äôt wait 5 years before my next blog post! Lol.</p>



<p>Michael.</p>

    <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10440v1">HTML (experimental)</a></p><blockquote>
            <span>Abstract:</span>Large language models have demonstrated substantial advancements in reasoning capabilities, particularly through inference-time scaling, as illustrated by models such as OpenAI's o1. However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle to perform systematic and structured reasoning, especially when handling complex visual question-answering tasks. In this work, we introduce LLaVA-o1, a novel VLM designed to conduct autonomous multistage reasoning. Unlike chain-of-thought prompting, LLaVA-o1 independently engages in sequential stages of summarization, visual interpretation, logical reasoning, and conclusion generation. This structured approach enables LLaVA-o1 to achieve marked improvements in precision on reasoning-intensive tasks. To accomplish this, we compile the LLaVA-o1-100k dataset, integrating samples from various visual question answering sources and providing structured reasoning annotations. Besides, we propose an inference-time stage-level beam search method, which enables effective inference-time scaling. Remarkably, with only 100k training samples and a simple yet effective inference time scaling method, LLaVA-o1 not only outperforms its base model by 8.9% on a wide range of multimodal reasoning benchmarks, but also surpasses the performance of larger and even closed-source models, such as Gemini-1.5-pro, GPT-4o-mini, and Llama-3.2-90B-Vision-Instruct.

Before I start, why am I doing this?
</p><p>

<b>I don't think HTML is being used enough as a platform for scientific publishing.</b></p><p>

Instead, people will:
</p><ol>
  <li>Use an interactive notebook like <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a>, <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-10.html">RStudio</a>, <a href="https://plutojl.org/">Pluto.jl</a> or <a href="https://observablehq.com/">Observable</a> to do data exploration, analysis and visualisation,</li>
  <li>Move to a publishing platform like <a href="https://typst.app/">Typst</a>, <a href="https://overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a>, pure <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>, or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> editor to typeset their work,</li>
  <li>Export to <code>.pdf</code> for distribution.</li>
</ol>
<p>
I think a HTML file can be used for all 3 of these stages, and prevent a lot of faffing around with manual processes, CLI tooling, CI steps and 3rd-party platforms.
</p><p>

HTML's typesetting capabilities are well documented, but its capabilities as a platform for data exploration, analysis and visualisation are not.
</p>
<p>
I'll try and demonstrate these capabilities, literate programming style.

</p>

</div>



<p>

We also want <code>contenteditable</code> <code>script</code>s to be re-evaluated on blur by building a clone of the <code>script</code> and then removing the original.
<br>



</p>



<div><p>

Now we'll declare a cell called <code>counter</code> that emits a number every second.
<b>The <code>script</code>'s <code>id</code> attribute is the same as the <code>name</code> parameter passed to <code>cell</code></b>.

</p><p>


<i>Try changing the initial counter value <code>i</code> above to a much bigger number, and then defocus the <code>script</code>.</i></p></div>
<p>

Now that we've created a our <code>counter</code> cell, we can create other cells that depend on it.

<br>

We'll import <a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/htl">Hypertext Literal</a> and use it to format the
<code>counter</code> value. <code>htl</code> implements a full-blown HTML5 parser that performs automatic escaping and 
interpolation of non-serializable values, such as event listeners, style objects, and other DOM nodes.



</p>


<p>
We can still observe the output of a cell without needing to show its definition. Just don't add the <code>echo</code> class. 
This makes them useful as a rendering primitive.


<i>(There's a hidden cell above ^)</i>

</p>

<p>

Alternatively, we can create a cell type that doesn't display its output at all.
<br>
We can use these cells to store intermediate values or datastructures.




Also note that cells can be declared out of order.





</p>



<p>

We can use cell values in more complex outputs. We'll import <a href="https://observablehq.com/plot/what-is-plot">Observable Plot</a> and use the <code>counter</code> value in a plot.



</p>

<p><img src="https://maxbo.me/img/up.png" alt="A computer displays a graph in the upward direction">
</p>

<div>

<h2>TeX, Markdown, Graphviz</h2><p>

We can return any type of DOM element from a cell. 
<br>
In this case, the <code>tex</code>, <code>md</code>, and <code>dot</code> cells return <code>span</code>, <code>table</code> and <code>svg</code> elements respectively.
</p><p>

<i>Try editing any of the following cells.</i></p></div>




<!-- <div class="slide">

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.13.18/dist/katex.min.css">
<script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/wypst@0.0.8/dist/wypst.min.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
  
<script type="module" class="echo" id="typst" contenteditable="true">
cell("typst", [], async () => {
  const div = document.createElement("div");
  await wypst.initialize()
  wypst.render("sum_(k=1)^n k = (n(n+1)) / 2", div);
  return div
});
</script> -->

<p><img src="https://maxbo.me/img/data.png" alt="A computer with an open CD tray is surrounded by data">
</p>

<div>

<h2>Cell status</h2><p>

We can also return a <code>Promise</code>, or throw an <code>Error</code>, from a cell.

Observable's <code>Inspector</code> will apply an <code>observablehq--running</code> or
<code>observablehq--error</code> class to the cell's outer <code>div</code> element respectively.
We'll style them appropriately:



</p></div>


<div>
<h2>Python</h2><p>

The <a href="http://pyodide.org/">Pyodide</a> CPython WASM distribution includes <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a>, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>, <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a>, <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/">scikit-learn</a>, and <a href="https://scipy.org/">Scipy</a>.
We'll rebuild the plot seen above, but using Matplotlib and Python's <code>sqlite3</code> module instead.

</p><p>

<i>Try editing one of the plot labels!</i></p></div>
<div>
<h2>R</h2><p>

You know the drill. It's R, using <a href="https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/">WebR</a>. 
I didn't figure out how to get <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a> <a href="https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/plotting.html">rendering</a> working, but I assume it's possible.

<i>I must disclose that this cell seems to be a bit flaky on iOS. I have not had a chance to investigate further, nor will I.</i>



</p></div>
<div>

<h2>Inputs</h2><p>

We'll create a new cell type <code>viewof</code> that works specifically with <a href="https://github.com/observablehq/inputs">Observable Inputs</a>.

It declares 2 reactive cells: <code>NAME</code> and <code>viewof NAME</code> - one for the value, and one for the DOM element itself.



</p></div>
<div><p>

To display the input above the cell, we set the cell <code>id</code> to <code>viewof NAME</code>.
</p><p>

<i>Wiggle the range input and see another dependent cell update.</i></p>




<p><i>NB: The way Observable Inputs work is a bit arcane. This demo of <a href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/synchronized-inputs">Synchronized Inputs</a> may shed some light.</i>

</p></div>
<div>

<h2>Mutability</h2><p>

Purely functional dataflow is great, but sometimes you just need to mutate state.
We'll create a new helper function <code>mutable</code>. It registers a <code>Mutable</code> - an object that yields new <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Generator"><code>Generator</code></a> values when the value is mutated - in the runtime.



</p></div>
<p><i>Try editing the initial state of the <code>mutable</code>.</i>



<i>Try editing the button labels.</i>





</p>


<!-- <h2>3D models</h2>

We can use Google's <a href="https://modelviewer.dev/"><code>&lt;model-viewer&gt;</code></a> <a href="https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction">Web Component</a> to display 3D models.

<script type="module" class="echo" id="model">
import 'https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/model-viewer/3.5.0/model-viewer.min.js';

cell("model", async () => {
  return htl.html`

});

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	<article>
		<div class="page">
			
			
			<p>I have come to believe that by and large ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù are doing more harm
than good. Not necessarily because they‚Äôre bad advice as such, but because
they‚Äôre mostly pounded by either 1) various types of zealots, idiots, and
assholes who abuse these kind of ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù as an argument from authority,
or 2) inexperienced programmers who lack the ability to judge the applicability,</p>

<p>Everyone else just says ‚ÄúX is better because Y‚Äù. This is an actual argument that
can be engaged with, and engaging with actual arguments is what discovers the
best solution for the situation at hand.</p>

<p>This is not unique to programming; even the best of ideas becomes silly once you
start uncritically applying it to everything ‚Äì one can find many examples in
politics. There, too, it‚Äôs mostly pounded by various types of zealots, idiots,
and assholes.</p>

<hr>

<p>All of this doesn‚Äôt mean that ‚Äúbest practice‚Äù are bad advice. Many are worth
reading, and some should always be followed. But many are little more ‚Äúthis
thing someone said‚Äù and/or ‚Äújust someone‚Äôs opinion‚Äù.</p>

<p>Take Postel‚Äôs ‚Äúlaw‚Äù ‚Äì what if I break this ‚Äúlaw‚Äù? Will the police come and
arrest me? Will I get the Nobel prize in physics as I‚Äôve discovered new laws of
nature? It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúlaw‚Äù in any meaningful sense: it‚Äôs just a thing this Postel
guy said in 1980, which may or may not be applicable to whatever you‚Äôre doing.</p>

<p><em>Postel‚Äôs quip</em> was probably good advice in 1980 in the context of TCP. There
were tons of little incompatibilities between existing implementations and
Postel was working on the first effort to actually standardize it all. Back then
it was typically harder to write fully correct implementations (no internet with
tons of examples, little to no testing, less access to other implementations,
etc.)</p>

<p>There are other cases where it‚Äôs the reasonable and practical thing to do. But
as a general concept applied to all protocols or all software development I find
it‚Äôs mostly a bad idea. I‚Äôm hardly the first to critique it, and it‚Äôs been
controversial for decades.</p>

<p>In spite of that, people citing <em>Postel‚Äôs quip</em> as if it‚Äôs somehow a ‚Äúlaw‚Äù are
still plentiful. My law is that everyone who does so is an idiot, asshole, or
some combination of both.</p>

<p>There are many more examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt use globals‚Äù is obviously good, but ‚Äúnever use globals under any
circumstances‚Äù is just silly. I‚Äôve seen people throw a hissy fit over
‚Äúglobals‚Äù in simple CLI tools with a few functions. Whoop-dee-doo.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt use unstructured GOTO‚Äù has turned into ‚Äúnever use goto‚Äù, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt use
continue because it‚Äôs like a hidden goto‚Äù, and ‚Äúuse single point of exit‚Äù, and
that kind of absolute insane bollocks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Repeat Yourself‚Äù (DRY) is basically good advice, but sometimes just
copy/pasting things is just the more pragmatic thing to do, and not really a
big deal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think ‚Äú12 factor app‚Äù has some okay ideas, some dubious ideas, and some
outright bad ideas.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While the basic ideas of ‚ÄúSOLID‚Äù are okay, I generally find that strong
adherence does not lead to particularly good code. It‚Äôs typically 80% fucking
about with <em>how</em> to do things, and 20% actually doing the stuff you want to do
(which makes things harder to understand and change, not easier).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>etc. etc. etc.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can disagree with any of the above, and that‚Äôs fine. But citing ‚Äúlaws‚Äù or
‚Äúbest practices‚Äù are just a fallacious arguments from authority.</p>

<hr>

<p>One of the difficulties with argueing against ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù is that it often
goes something like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>‚ÄúX is not according to best practices‚Äù</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>‚ÄúI think X is better because Y‚Äù</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs not following best practice Z! Here is a book about it! Why don‚Äôt
you follow it?! Do you want to write bad code?!‚Äù</em></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There is kind of a gaslighting effect here, because it‚Äôs very natural to assume
that maybe you <em>should</em> be following the ‚Äúbest practice‚Äù, especially when
declared with great arrogance.</p>

<p>This is the same fallacious argument people use for safety:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt X will improve safety.‚Äù</em></p>
  </li>
  <li><em>‚ÄúWhat?! You don‚Äôt care about safety?!‚Äù</em></li>
  <li>or: <em>‚ÄúBetter safe than sorry!‚Äù</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Which is why safety regulation only grows and never shrinks, even when the
regulation just makes no sense eat all: arguing against it is hard, because the
look of things is against you. I call this the <em>Safety Fallacy</em>.</p>

<p>If you hear the term "black company", what kind of company do you imagine? As we all know, black is the darkest color, so if you pictured an evil company with a dark side then you would be on the right track. A black company (aka "black corporation" or "black business") is <i>buraku kigy≈ç</i> <ruby>„Éñ„É©„ÉÉ„ÇØ<rp>Ôºà</rp><rt></rt><rp>Ôºâ</rp></ruby><i></i> <ruby>‰ºÅÊ•≠<rp>Ôºà</rp><rt>„Åç„Åé„Çá„ÅÜ</rt><rp>Ôºâ</rp></ruby> in Japanese. In general, it is a term used to refer to an unacceptably exploitative employment system.</p>

<p>Now, maybe you're thinking this is a word to describe a factory somewhere in China, but you'd be wrong. The term is actually usually associated with white-collar industries rather than blue-collar ones. It was coined by young IT workers in the early 2000's and, being the IT workers that they were, spread this nickname around the internet as an internet meme. Now, thanks to its fame, it is a term that can be used for other industries that are not IT.</p>

<h2 id="the-black-company-and-a-film">The Black Company And A Film</h2>

<p>As the popularity of the term grew, the black company problem received more and more attention in Japan. In 2009, a drama film called "A man on the verge at a BLACK company" was released. It was based on an office worker who started a 2ch thread about the black company he worked at. This company's ruthless and unethical work environment was duplicated in the film.</p>

<p><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ebxD-KJNFwk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="„Éñ„É©„ÉÉ„ÇØ‰ºöÁ§æ„Å´Âã§„ÇÅ„Å¶„Çã„Çì„Å†„Åå„ÄÅ„ÇÇ„ÅÜ‰ø∫„ÅØÈôêÁïå„Åã„ÇÇ„Åó„Çå„Å™„ÅÑ"></iframe></p>

<p>As you can see in the film clip, the workers are being pushed to their limit and obviously not in good shape. Can you imagine working someplace like that for real? Well, bad (black) companies are really out there and this sparked a move towards calling them out. Still, there was a long way to go to bring about public awareness.</p>

<h2 id="the-black-company-awards">The Black Company Awards</h2>

<figure><img alt="A skyscraper housing a Japanese Black Company" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japan/2014-04-25-japanese-black-companies/black-company-building.jpg"><figcaption>  </figcaption> Source: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sharif/3299531471" title="Visit source's website" target="_blank">Beshef</a></figure>

<p>In 2012, a group of people that included journalists, activists, and university professors formed a special committee to create the "Black Corporations Award" where the public could vote on "the most evil corporations of the year." The award name may sound silly, but its creators were not joking. They were hoping to raise awareness of black company issues as well as expose some of the evil abusers of employees. This is now an annual award.</p>

<figure><img alt="Graphic with Japanese text saying Most Evil Corporation Award" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japan/2014-04-25-japanese-black-companies/most-evil-corporation-award.jpg"></figure>

<p>The most recent award, which took place on June 17th of 2013, nominated eight companies:</p>

  <li>Actual public records on occupational problems such as a long work time, sexual harassment, or abuse of power.</li>
  <li>Long intense work hours.</li>
  <li>Low pay.</li>
  <li>Compliance violations.</li>
  <li>Flaws in the system, such as lack of childcare leave or maternity leave.</li>
  <li>Hostility to unions.</li>
  <li>Discrimination against temporary workers.</li>
  <li>Temporary worker dependance.</li>
  <li>npaid overtime (and lies about paid overtime in the job advertisements).</li>
</ol>

<p>Most black companies already have the above problems, so the nominees were chosen for being especially bad. After the nominations, there was a period in which people could vote. The winner? Watami Foodservice Co., and by a wide margin. They got 21,899 votes, 72% of the total. This was followed by Tohoku University (3,475 votes), Benesse Corporation (1,258 votes), Cross Company Inc (1,220 votes), Seino Transportation Co., Ltd (1,000 votes), Ohsho Food Service Corporation (744 votes), Sun Challenge Corporation (649 votes), and Tokyu Hands Inc (346 votes). Watami has won this award for two years in a row so far.</p>

<p>Watami's winning streak is due to its notoriously abysmal mistreatment of young workers. In 2008, Mina Mori, a female employee of Watami, committed suicide at the age of 26 after reportedly working 141 hours of overtime in one month. It happened just two months after joining the restaurant chain. Some people may think committing suicide is an individual matter and that a company cannot be held responsible. However, it is reasonable to assume Mori would not have chosen suicide for herself had she not been forced into such a desperate situation. Furthermore, it is apparent just how "black" the Watami company is simply by the cold reaction of Watami founder Miki Watanabe's reaction to the case. He not only refused to meet with her family but also refused to apologize to them until last month. He finally did offer an apology in court on March 27, 2014, though he still has denied liability.</p>

<p>According to an interview with a former Watami restaurant manager conducted by Takarajima magazine (September 2013 edition), upon hearing the news of Ms. Mori's suicide, the ex-manager wondered if it was really <em>just</em> 141 hours. During his time at Watami, he regularly worked from 7am to 12am with almost no break, making his monthly overtime over 300 hours. He also revealed that Miki Watanabe gives extreme messages to workers on every payday, such as: "Regret as hard as you die!" He even received a personal letter from the evil president in his paycheck envelope saying: "you should reflect on your sales this month by killing yourself."</p>

<figure><img alt="The exterior of a Watami Bar during the evening" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japan/2014-04-25-japanese-black-companies/watami-bar-at-night.jpg"><figcaption>  </figcaption> Source: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/miyo/2473313816" title="Visit source's website" target="_blank">Miyo Sekimoto</a></figure>

<p>There was also an illegal but mandatory 1,000 yen deduction from every payment and workers were told that it was for "social contribution." When Watanabe published his own book, the price of the book was automatically deducted from the payment and workers were forced to buy them as well. Although there wasn't any physical violence, he remembered that there was much verbal violence, often relating to "killing himself."</p>

<p>That sounds pretty awful, right? These workers were not treated like human beings‚Ä¶ more like robots. Though even robots shouldn't have to work this hard. Obviously a lot of other people felt the same way and anti-Watami movements have risen. On the same day that Watami apologized to Ms. Mori's family, Watami decided to temporarily close 60 restaurants (about 10% of the total) to improve their work environment. I hope this will really be the start of some reform so that others won't have to endure the same mistreatment.</p>

<p>Perhaps thanks to this and the awareness brought about by the Black Company Awards, the term <i>buraku kigy≈ç</i> <ruby>„Éñ„É©„ÉÉ„ÇØ<rp>Ôºà</rp><rt></rt><rp>Ôºâ</rp></ruby><i></i> <ruby>‰ºÅÊ•≠<rp>Ôºà</rp><rt>„Åç„Åé„Çá„ÅÜ</rt><rp>Ôºâ</rp></ruby> made the final 10 of the most popular or influential Japanese buzzwords in 2013! So, consider the checkbox of "raising awareness" filled in, though there's still much work to be done.</p>

<h2 id="what-colors-a-company-black">What Colors A Company Black?</h2>

<figure><img alt="Black paint chipping off a wall" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japan/2014-04-25-japanese-black-companies/black-wall.jpg"><figcaption>  </figcaption> Source: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dg_pics/3938829378" title="Visit source's website" target="_blank">David Gunter</a></figure>

<p>So what are the exact qualifications for a company to be considered a black company? You can get some idea from the stories of Watami, but a lawyer named Yoshiyuki Iwasa, who is also the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/o/ASIN/4907292090/itmedia-makoto-22/">„Éñ„É©„ÉÉ„ÇØ<i></i> <ruby>‰ºÅÊ•≠<rp>Ôºà</rp><rt>„Åç„Åé„Çá„ÅÜ</rt><rp>Ôºâ</rp></ruby>„Å´<i></i> <ruby>ÂÄçËøî<rp>Ôºà</rp><rt>„Åç„Åé„Çá„ÅÜ</rt><rp>Ôºâ</rp></ruby>„Åó„Å†!</a> (which means "to take double revenge on the black company") <a href="http://bizmakoto.jp/makoto/articles/1401/23/news018_2.html">created a checklist for a website called Business Media</a> to find out whether the company is "black" or "not black." There are thirty items on the list and if none of them apply to the company, it is pure white. If 1-9 items are applicable, it is considered gray. 10-14 is dark gray. 30 out of 30 is pitch black. You get the picture. Now let's take a look at the list.</p>

<ol>
  <li>I do work overtime, but overtime is never paid.</li>
  <li>It's usual to work more than 80 hours overtime a month.</li>
  <li>I don't have a break, or at the most, 10 minutes a day.</li>
  <li>I work on my days off. Actually, I'm not even sure when my days off are.</li>
  <li>There is no paid time off system or if there is such a system, I am never allowed to use it.</li>
  <li>I never get reimbursed for expenses and always have to pay out of pocket.</li>
  <li>There is no social insurance, benefits, or pension. If I ask about this, I would be bullied.</li>
  <li>If I converted my monthly wage into an hourly rate equivalent, it would be less than minimum wage.</li>
  <li>Regardless of how long I work overtime, the overtime payment is a fixed amount.</li>
  <li>The company is constantly hiring new employees.</li>
  <li>The advertised job wage is different from the actual amount paid.</li>
  <li>There are no time cards or someone else punches you in and out.</li>
  <li>There are one or more workers who can't come to the office due to psychotic depression or nervous breakdown.</li>
  <li>I'm so busy that I often can't get adequate sleep.</li>
  <li>There is no union or company regulations.</li>
  <li>Some employees are promoted to an administrative position right after joining the company, but there is no extra remuneration for that.</li>
  <li>Employees have to run private errands for their employers.</li>
  <li>There is a slogan saying "work until you die" on the company wall.</li>
  <li>Abuse of power and sexual harassment are very common.</li>
  <li>There are so many affiliate companies and subsidiaries, though I don't even know what those companies do.</li>
  <li>Whenever some incident happens, the company changes its name.</li>
  <li>There are training sessions, which use what can be considered brainwashing or hazing.</li>
  <li>Threats such as "I'm going to kill you" can be commonly heard at the office.</li>
  <li>Violence is rampant.</li>
  <li>All the supervisors are relatives of the CEO.</li>
  <li>I was told to quit the company in a roundabout way like, "you may not be cut out for this position."</li>
  <li>I can't quit the job. If I say I'm going to quit, I'll be threatened that I will have to pay damages for quitting.</li>
  <li>They don't provide the necessary documents such as the separation slip to those who try to quit.</li>
  <li>The worker's average age is really young.</li>
  <li>The rate of people leaving their jobs within 3 years is really high.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now after looking through them, do any of these conditions apply to your company? Many of the items may sound ridiculous, but I have worked under some of these conditions before and I have some friends who work for such companies. However, I'm not sure if their companies are pitch black. Maybe just very, very dark?</p>

<figure><img alt="Black paint trailing down a white wall" src="https://files.tofugu.com/articles/japan/2014-04-25-japanese-black-companies/dripping-black-paint.jpg"><figcaption>  </figcaption> Source: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/rockandbacon/4600142725" title="Visit source's website" target="_blank">rockandbacon</a></figure>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/houdou/2r985200000339uj.html">Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare</a>, the number of cases delivered to the General Labor Consultation Center in 2012 was 1,067,210. 254,719 of them involved troubles at work such as encouragement of early retirement, worsening work conditions, the lowering of pay, long periods of overtime without payment, or mean, abusive bosses and/or coworkers. A decade ago, only around 100,000 cases were reported. This number has increased about 2.5x, showing that either black companies are increasing in number, or, what is more likely, more people are coming forward. These companies are finally having their true colors exposed (black).</p>

<p>In September, 2013, the Labor Ministry began a crackdown on black companies, too. They examined 5,111 such companies based on their high turnover rates of young workers, their past violations, and complaints from employees. Then it was revealed that over 80% of them, 4,189 companies, were indeed actually black companies engaged in illegal business practices. They were flagged for violations against the Labor Standards Act. The ministry intends to discipline the companies in question and if those companies continue to violate the Labor Standards laws, their names will be made public.</p>

<p>So, now that the Labor Ministry is getting involved, can we call this the end of the story? Well, I'm afraid it's not over yet. This was only the ministry's first survey on black companies and there are over 4 million companies in Japan. So, the exciting fight has only just begun! We're counting on you, Black Company Awards and Japan's Labor Ministry!</p>

<p><a href="https://career-research.mynavi.jp/reserch/20241003_86953/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>A new survey from Mynavi Corp.</em></a><em> shows a significant rise in resignation agencies across Japan that help people quit their jobs. But why?</em></p>



<p>With deep remorse, Mr. Iida sank to the floor. His knees touched the cold concrete, and he bowed so profoundly that his head almost met the ground. ‚ÄúDogeza,‚Äù the most sincere way to apologize for a serious offense, performed by a salaryman in his boss‚Äôs office. The reason? Mr. Iida submitted his resignation. But, after a brief silence, there was a tearing sound, and he realized his boss had ripped his resignation letter to shreds. The message was clear: <em>you are not allowed to quit.</em></p>



<p>In Japan, leaving a job can be challenging. Traditionally, employment is considered a lifelong commitment. Though Japan is moving away from this outdated mentality, many traditional companies still expect employees to work until retirement without changing jobs.</p>



<p>For some older generations, there is still a deep sense of shame in switching jobs, as work ethic in Japan is closely tied to loyalty and respect. Japanese law technically guarantees the right to quit, but doing so is often seen as disrespectful, as companies invest time and money in training employees. It is a mutual investment ‚Äî the company invests in you, and you, in turn, commit to advancing within the organization over time.</p>



<h2>‚ÄúI Can‚Äôt Take This Anymore‚Äù</h2>



<p>Mr. Iida performed the dogeza three times before his boss, apologizing for ‚Äúletting him down,‚Äù yet his resignation still wasn‚Äôt accepted. He had to find another way out.</p>



<p>He contacted the resignation agency Momuri, whose name translates to ‚ÄúI Can‚Äôt Take This Anymore.‚Äù For around ¬•22,000, they handle the entire resignation process, contacting the boss on behalf of the client, negotiating with the company, and even recommending lawyers if legal disputes arise.</p>



<p>According to Yujin Watanabe, a spokesperson from Albatross Corp., which manages Momuri‚Äôs services, their typical client profile is young people in their 20s who work for small to medium-sized companies, often in corporate or welfare industries.</p>



<p>Mr. Iida is far from alone in seeking outside help to resign. Since 2022, Momuri, just one independent resignation agency, has received 35,000 requests from people needing assistance quitting their jobs.</p>



<h2>1 in 5 in Their 20s Use Resignation Agencies</h2>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="611" src="https://metropolisjapan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mynavi-Corporation-resignation-agency-age-metropolis-japan-1000x611.png" alt="" srcset="https://metropolisjapan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mynavi-Corporation-resignation-agency-age-metropolis-japan-1000x611.png 1000w, https://metropolisjapan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mynavi-Corporation-resignation-agency-age-metropolis-japan-654x400.png 654w, https://metropolisjapan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mynavi-Corporation-resignation-agency-age-metropolis-japan-250x153.png 250w, https://metropolisjapan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mynavi-Corporation-resignation-agency-age-metropolis-japan-768x470.png 768w, https://metropolisjapan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mynavi-Corporation-resignation-agency-age-metropolis-japan.png 1220w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"><figcaption>Mynavi Corporation: use of resignation services in the past year by age group and occupation.</figcaption></figure>



<p>A new survey by the employment information provider Mynavi Corp. found that nearly 1 in 5 people in their 20s who quit their jobs in Japan last year used agencies like Momuri to help them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The survey, which included employees ages 20-50 who quit jobs between June 2023 and June 2024, shows that 18.6% of those in their 20s used these services, 17.6% were in their 30s and 17.3% were in their 40s. Only 4.4% were in their 50s, indicating that older employees tend to stay in jobs longer‚Äîeven if conditions are poor‚Äîas the younger generation is more likely to adjust to their needs and wishes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The top-cited reason for using resignation agencies, at 40.7%, was that companies refused to let them quit. Other reasons included fear of backlash if they resigned alone or their work environment discouraged employees from quitting independently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mynavi Corp. also surveyed workplaces and asked managers how often employees under their supervision had used resignation agencies. Between January and June 2024, 23.2% reported that they had employees who used resignation agencies. The most common fields were insurance, finance and IT.</p>



<h2><strong>Resignation Agencies Reflect Japan‚Äôs Mental Health Crisis</strong></h2>



<p>According to Momuri, most Japanese people in corporate roles have a low awareness of mental health. Social norms often discourage <a href="https://metropolisjapan.com/japanese-books-mental-health-wellbeing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seeking help for mental challenges</a>‚Äîmany of which stem from their work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This lack of support is one reason more Japanese people now turn to resignation agencies. They quit to avoid damaging their mental health and use resignation agencies to sidestep the stress of handling the process themselves.</p>



<p>Mr. Iida‚Äôs experience of his boss tearing up his resignation letter is not unique. In fact, it‚Äôs far from the most extreme case. Momuri confirms stories of companies forcing employees to visit temples to ‚Äòcure‚Äô their desire to quit. Sometimes they even receive home visits from managers pressuring them to stay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those fortunate enough to leave are sometimes asked to send apology letters to colleagues or deliver speeches expressing regret for their ‚Äúselfishness‚Äù and ‚Äúdisrespect.‚Äù Of course, these are the most extreme cases‚Äìbut they do occur, according to Momuri.</p>



<p>Some companies are notorious for resignation difficulties, excessive overtime and intense work pressure. So much so that they are labeled as ‚Äúblack companies.‚Äù The problem has become so severe that Japan‚Äôs Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare‚Äôs Labor Standards Bureau has published a list of these companies to warn potential job seekers.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="647" src="https://metropolisjapan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mynavi-Corporation-resignation-agency-reason-metropolis-japan-1000x647.png" alt="" srcset="https://metropolisjapan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mynavi-Corporation-resignation-agency-reason-metropolis-japan-1000x647.png 1000w, https://metropolisjapan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mynavi-Corporation-resignation-agency-reason-metropolis-japan-618x400.png 618w, https://metropolisjapan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mynavi-Corporation-resignation-agency-reason-metropolis-japan-250x162.png 250w, https://metropolisjapan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mynavi-Corporation-resignation-agency-reason-metropolis-japan-768x497.png 768w, https://metropolisjapan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Mynavi-Corporation-resignation-agency-reason-metropolis-japan.png 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"><figcaption>Mynavi Corporation: Reasons for using resignation service. </figcaption></figure>



<h2><strong>Generational Change Could Be Japan‚Äôs Savior</strong></h2>



<p>A generational shift is underway in Japan, one that may eventually ease work-related pressures and their sometimes fatal consequences. Physical strain and mental stress contribute to both <em>karojisatsu</em>, or ‚Äòoverwork suicide,‚Äô and <em>karoshi</em>, or ‚Äòdeath by overwork‚Äô.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.niph.go.jp/journal/data/73-1/202473010003.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare</a>, the number of Japanese people who committed suicide due to their work rose from 1,935 cases in 2021 to 2,968 in 2022. This marked a record high. While the figure has since slightly decreased, the strain on workers remains severe.</p>



<p>Since they first appeared in 2018, resignation agencies have become an essential ally in Japan‚Äôs work culture shift. These agencies empower young workers to prioritize their mental well-being and advocate for change, providing a way out for those trapped in restrictive work environments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This growing reliance on resignation services underscores a generational pushback against outdated norms and signals a potential transformation in Japan‚Äôs work culture. If these shifts continue, Japan‚Äôs younger generation may indeed pave the way toward a more balanced and sustainable future for the country‚Äôs workforce. Let‚Äôs hope they succeed.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In perhaps the largest swatting case to ever be prosecuted, an 18-year-old from Lancaster, California, has pleaded guilty to federal charges stemming from a nationwide spree of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/alan-filion-torswats-swatting-arrest/">hundreds of shooting and bomb threat hoaxes</a> that sent police scrambling to high schools, courthouses, and the homes of law enforcement officials and prominent politicians.</p><p>Alan Winston Filion now faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison for each of four counts of making interstate threats to injure the person of another, according to the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/california-teenager-pleads-guilty-florida-making-hundreds-swatting-calls-across-united">United States Department of Justice</a>.</p><p>Early this year, Filion was <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/torswats-swatting-arrest/">arrested and extradited</a> to Seminole County, Florida. At the time, state prosecutors charged Filion with four state-level felony counts stemming from a single incident in which, prosecutors allege, Filion told a Sanford Police Department dispatcher that he was armed with pipe bombs and an AR-15 rifle and was walking into Masjid Al Hayy Mosque to kill everyone he saw.</p><p>Filion, whom authorities believe operated online as ‚ÄúTorswats,‚Äù has been in jail without a trial for nearly a year. He entered a plea of not guilty to the state charges.</p><p>The federal charges announced on Wednesday, along with interviews from people connected to the investigation‚Äîand Filion himself‚Äîallege his swatting activities reached far beyond Florida‚Äôs borders.</p><p>Between approximately August 2022 to January 2024 Filion made more than 375 swatting calls, according to the plea agreement. These included incidents where he claimed to have planted bombs or threatened to conduct mass shootings at targeted locations that included religious institutions, high schools, and historically black colleges and universities.</p><p>‚ÄúThis prosecution and today‚Äôs guilty plea reaffirm the Justice Department‚Äôs commitment to using all tools to hold accountable every individual who endangers our communities through swatting and hoax threats,‚Äù deputy attorney general Lisa Monaco said in a statement. ‚ÄúFor well over a year, Alan Filion targeted religious institutions, schools, government officials, and other innocent victims with hundreds of false threats of imminent mass shootings, bombings, and other violent crimes. He caused profound fear and chaos and will now face the consequences of his actions.‚Äù</p><p>According to court records, Filion was also part of a high-profile international swatting group that targeted several prominent figures between December 2023 and January 2024. Among the victims were US Homeland Security secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency director Jen Easterly, Republican US representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, and Republican senator Rick Scott of Florida. Investigators say they linked the scheme to roughly 100 calls, one of which targeted an unnamed former president of the United States.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In August, the Department of Justice <a data-offer-url="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/28/2-men-charged-with-swatting-members-of-congress-00176675" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/28/2-men-charged-with-swatting-members-of-congress-00176675&quot;}" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/28/2-men-charged-with-swatting-members-of-congress-00176675" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">charged two European men,</a> Tomasz Szabo and Nemanja Radovanovic, in connection with the widespread swatting operation, which led to at least one car accident with injuries. During interviews with the US Secret Service in January and February, both men admitted their roles in the scheme. Radovanovic, however, claimed that he was directed by a third party who provided detailed scripts and selected the targets.</p><p>According to the plea agreement, Filion admitted to orchestrating the operation, supplying the names, addresses, and phone numbers of many of the targeted individuals.</p><p>‚ÄúI shot my wife in the head with my AR-15,‚Äù a man identifying himself as "James" said in one such call. He told dispatchers in Georgia that he caught his wife sleeping with another man and, after killing her, had taken the man hostage. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll release him for $10,000 in cash,‚Äù he added, threatening to detonate pipe bombs and blow up the house if his demands weren‚Äôt met. This call targeted the home of Georgia state senator John Albers.</p><p>The case against Filion, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/torswats-swatting-arrest/">first reported by WIRED</a>, was built on a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/alan-filion-torswats-swatting-arrest/">trail of digital evidence</a> left across platforms like Telegram, YouTube, and Discord, and pieced together by Brad ‚ÄúCafrozed‚Äù Dennis, a private investigator. Dennis had been hired by two high-profile Twitch stars, both victims of Torswats‚Äô calls, to find the person responsible.</p><p>For months, Dennis had posed online as a vengeful ex-husband looking to troll and harass his former wife. He used this persona to infiltrate <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/764-com-child-predator-network/">private Discord servers and Telegram groups</a> where Torswats and affiliates hung out. These were chats dedicated to extortion plots and racist memes; channels filled with child sexual abuse material, self-harm, and animal abuse‚Äîsome of the worst content he'd ever seen, Dennis told WIRED.</p><p>On New Year's Eve 2022, Dennis sent Torswats a private message on Telegram: ‚ÄúYou wanna make some real cash? Add me on Tox,‚Äù he wrote, referring to the peer-to-peer messaging service, under the pretense of arranging a swatting.</p><p>Using network monitoring tools, Dennis then captured the IP address linked to the Torswats account and uncovered a new username: "Paimon Arnum." In January 2023, Dennis handed this critical piece of evidence, along with other usernames and active Discord servers he had tracked over several months, over to the FBI.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>According to emails reviewed by WIRED, that information was central to how the FBI broke the case and was the basis of subpoenas sent to Discord and Google in April of 2023 seeking information on accounts Dennis had identified. By early May, the FBI had successfully pinpointed Torswats‚Äô identity and location.</p><p>That month, Torswats privately took responsibility for swatting incidents in Telegram chats reviewed by WIRED. These incidents affected up to 25 schools in Washington state, impacting approximately 18,116 students and costing taxpayers an estimated $271,173 in lost instructional time, according to Don Beeler, CEO of <a data-offer-url="https://tdrtechnologysolutions.com/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://tdrtechnologysolutions.com/&quot;}" href="https://tdrtechnologysolutions.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">TDR Technology Solutions</a>, a company specializing in school surveillance and threat analysis.</p><p>Additionally, 911 audio and other police records obtained by WIRED corroborate that the same individual made the calls for more than a dozen of these swatting incidents. In some instances, the caller told dispatchers he had been commanded by Satan to kill students. In others, he said he had been mistreated because he was gay. In others, he seemed to have become bored enough with the game that he didn‚Äôt bother to make up a reason.</p><p>On July 12, the Torswats handle announced a new swatting operation dubbed the ‚ÄúGrand Offensive,‚Äù targeting a dozen senators. Three days later, the FBI raided Filion‚Äôs home and seized his electronic devices.</p><p>But the raid didn‚Äôt stop the swatting.</p><p>On November 6, 2023, someone using the Torswats handle took responsibility for a bomb threat aimed at North Beach High School in Ocean Shores, Washington, through a Telegram message. According to police reports and call records obtained by WIRED, the caller impersonated a drug dealer who wanted to report his client to the police because he had said he had placed pipe bombs around the school and was planning a mass shooting. That same month, a person going by Torswats also admitted to swatting an <a data-offer-url="https://ubivisproject.org/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://ubivisproject.org/&quot;}" href="https://ubivisproject.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">investigator and cybercrime expert</a> named Keven Hendricks in private Telegram communications.</p><p>Both threats could be attributed to the same individual, according to a law enforcement official who reviewed the recordings for WIRED but requested anonymity because they were unauthorized to speak to the press.</p><p>Details about Filion‚Äôs life outside his online activities remain sparse. Enrollment records from Lancaster‚Äôs Antelope Valley Community College show that Filion began pursuing a degree in mathematics in the fall of 2022. A former classmate, who requested anonymity due to fears of retaliation, described Filion as quiet and ‚Äúforgettable.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt appear to have many friends,‚Äù they said.</p><p>In January 2024, an individual affiliated with the Torswats Telegram account and claiming to be a friend of Filion suggested that he was part of a group aiming to incite racial violence and that he sought money to ‚Äúbuy weapons and commit a mass shooting.‚Äù The allegation aligns with a written tip, placed to the FBI‚Äôs Internet Crime Complaint Center in April 2023 and obtained by WIRED, alleging that the person behind the Torswats account was involved in a neo-Nazi cult known as the Order of Nine Angles.</p><p>‚ÄúHe believes he is doing his part to bring about the end of days by ‚Äòbleeding the finances and man hours of the system,‚Äô‚Äù the tipster wrote.</p><p>Filion‚Äôs family could not be immediately reached for comment. A sentencing date for the teenager has not yet been set.</p><p><em>Updated at 10:45 am EST, November, 2024: Added additional details about Filion‚Äôs involvement in swatting attacks against prominent US government officials and others.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">Presented at the Web Engines Hackfest, 2024. Focus on the details of why a
data-oriented engine design is interesting, what sort of benefits it gives and
what sort of costs it has. Explores the engine at a slightly deeper level.</p>
<p dir="auto">The talk was revisited at the TC39 June meeting, 2024. No video is available,

<p dir="auto">The architecture of the engine follows the ECMAScript specification in spirit,
but uses data-oriented design for the actual implementation. Records that are
present in the specification are likely present in the Nova engine as well and
they're likely found in an "equivalent" file / folder path as the specification
defines them in.</p>
<p dir="auto">Where the engine differs from the specification is that most ECMAScript types
and specification Record types are defined "twice": They have one "heap data"
definition, and another "index" definition. The heap data definition generally
corresponds to the specification's definition, in some degree at least. The
index definition is either a wrapper around <code>u32</code> or a <code>NonZeroU32</code>. Most spec
defined methods are defined on the index definitions (this avoids issues with
borrowing).</p>
<p dir="auto">The only case when direct "Record type A contains Record type B" ownership is
used is when there can be only one referrer to the Record type B.</p>

<p dir="auto">Reading the above, you might be wondering why the double-definitions and all
that. The ultimate reason is two-fold:</p>

            <p>MIT engineers have built a new desalination system that runs with the rhythms of the sun.</p><p>The solar-powered system removes salt from water at a pace that closely follows changes in solar energy. As sunlight increases through the day, the system ramps up its desalting process and automatically adjusts to any sudden variation in sunlight, for example by dialing down in response to a passing cloud or revving up as the skies clear.</p><p>Because the system can quickly react to subtle changes in sunlight, it maximizes the utility of solar energy, producing large quantities of clean water despite variations in sunlight throughout the day. In contrast to other solar-driven desalination designs, the MIT system requires no extra batteries for energy storage, nor a supplemental power supply, such as from the grid.</p><p>The engineers tested a community-scale prototype on groundwater wells in New Mexico over six months, working in variable weather conditions and water types. The system harnessed on average over 94 percent of the electrical energy generated from the system‚Äôs solar panels to produce up to 5,000 liters of water per day despite large swings in weather and available sunlight.</p><p>‚ÄúConventional desalination technologies require steady power and need battery storage to smooth out a variable power source like solar. By continually varying power consumption in sync with the sun, our technology directly and efficiently uses solar power to make water,‚Äù says Amos Winter, the Germeshausen Professor of Mechanical Engineering and director of the K. Lisa Yang Global Engineering and Research (GEAR) Center at MIT. ‚ÄúBeing able to make drinking water with renewables, without requiring battery storage, is a massive grand challenge. And we‚Äôve done it.‚Äù</p><p>The system is geared toward desalinating brackish groundwater ‚Äî a salty source of water that is found in underground reservoirs and is more prevalent than fresh groundwater resources. The researchers see brackish groundwater as a huge untapped source of potential drinking water, particularly as reserves of fresh water are stressed in parts of the world. They envision that the new renewable, battery-free system could provide much-needed drinking water at low costs, especially for inland communities where access to seawater and grid power are limited.</p><p>‚ÄúThe majority of the population actually lives far enough from the coast, that seawater desalination could never reach them. They consequently rely heavily on groundwater, especially in remote, low-income regions. And unfortunately, this groundwater is becoming more and more saline due to climate change,‚Äù says Jonathan Bessette, MIT PhD student in mechanical engineering. ‚ÄúThis technology could bring sustainable, affordable clean water to underreached places around the world.‚Äù</p><p>The researchers report details the new system in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-024-00314-6" target="_blank">paper appearing today in <em>Nature Water</em></a>. The study‚Äôs co-authors are Bessette, Winter, and staff engineer Shane Pratt.</p><p><strong>Pump and flow</strong></p><p>The new system builds on a previous design, which Winter and his colleagues, including former MIT postdoc Wei He, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s44221-024-00213-w?utm_source=rct_congratemailt&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=oa_20240326&amp;utm_content=10.1038%2Fs44221-024-00213-w" target="_blank">reported earlier this year</a>. That system aimed to desalinate water through ‚Äúflexible batch electrodialysis.‚Äù</p><p>Electrodialysis and reverse osmosis are two of the main methods used to desalinate brackish groundwater. With reverse osmosis, pressure is used to pump salty water through a membrane and filter out salts. Electrodialysis uses an electric field to draw out salt ions as water is pumped through a stack of ion-exchange membranes.</p><p>Scientists have looked to power both methods with renewable sources. But this has been especially challenging for reverse osmosis systems, which traditionally run at a steady power level that‚Äôs incompatible with naturally variable energy sources such as the sun.</p><p>Winter, He, and their colleagues focused on electrodialysis, seeking ways to make a more flexible, ‚Äútime-variant‚Äù system that would be responsive to variations in renewable, solar power.</p><p>In their previous design, the team built an electrodialysis system consisting of water pumps, an ion-exchange membrane stack, and a solar panel array. The innovation in this system was a model-based control system that used sensor readings from every part of the system to predict the optimal rate at which to pump water through the stack and the voltage that should be applied to the stack to maximize the amount of salt drawn out of the water.</p><p>When the team tested this system in the field, it was able to vary its water production with the sun‚Äôs natural variations. On average, the system directly used 77 percent of the available electrical energy produced by the solar panels, which the team estimated was 91 percent more than traditionally designed solar-powered electrodialysis systems.</p><p>Still, the researchers felt they could do better.</p><p>‚ÄúWe could only calculate every three minutes, and in that time, a cloud could literally come by and block the sun,‚Äù Winter says. ‚ÄúThe system could be saying, ‚ÄòI need to run at this high power.‚Äô But some of that power has suddenly dropped because there‚Äôs now less sunlight. So, we had to make up that power with extra batteries.‚Äù</p><p><strong>Solar commands</strong></p><p>In their latest work, the researchers looked to eliminate the need for batteries, by shaving the system‚Äôs response time to a fraction of a second. The new system is able to update its desalination rate, three to five times per second. The faster response time enables the system to adjust to changes in sunlight throughout the day, without having to make up any lag in power with additional power supplies.</p><p>The key to the nimbler desalting is a simpler control strategy, devised by Bessette and Pratt. The new strategy is one of ‚Äúflow-commanded current control,‚Äù in which the system first senses the amount of solar power that is being produced by the system‚Äôs solar panels. If the panels are generating more power than the system is using, the controller automatically ‚Äúcommands‚Äù the system to dial up its pumping, pushing more water through the electrodialysis stacks. Simultaneously, the system diverts some of the additional solar power by increasing the electrical current delivered to the stack, to drive more salt out of the faster-flowing water.</p><p>‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say the sun is rising every few seconds,‚Äù Winter explains. ‚ÄúSo, three times a second, we‚Äôre looking at the solar panels and saying, ‚ÄòOh, we have more power ‚Äî let‚Äôs bump up our flow rate and current a little bit.‚Äô When we look again and see there‚Äôs still more excess power, we‚Äôll up it again. As we do that, we‚Äôre able to closely match our consumed power with available solar power really accurately, throughout the day. And the quicker we loop this, the less battery buffering we need.‚Äù</p><p>The engineers incorporated the new control strategy into a fully automated system that they sized to desalinate brackish groundwater at a daily volume that would be enough to supply a small community of about 3,000 people. They operated the system for six months on several wells at the Brackish Groundwater National Desalination Research Facility in Alamogordo, New Mexico. Throughout the trial, the prototype operated under a wide range of solar conditions, harnessing over 94 percent of the solar panel‚Äôs electrical energy, on average, to directly power desalination.</p><p>‚ÄúCompared to how you would traditionally design a solar desal system, we cut our required battery capacity by almost 100 percent,‚Äù Winter says.</p><p>The engineers plan to further test and scale up the system in hopes of supplying larger communities, and even whole municipalities, with low-cost, fully sun-driven drinking water.</p><p>‚ÄúWhile this is a major step forward, we‚Äôre still working diligently to continue developing lower cost, more sustainable desalination methods,‚Äù Bessette says.</p><p>‚ÄúOur focus now is on testing, maximizing reliability, and building out a product line that can provide desalinated water using renewables to multiple markets around&nbsp;the&nbsp;world," Pratt adds.</p><p>The team will be launching a company based on their technology in the coming months.</p><p>This research was supported in part by the National Science Foundation, the Julia Burke Foundation, and the MIT Morningside Academy of Design. This work was additionally supported in-kind by Veolia Water Technologies and Solutions and Xylem Goulds.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-3312850032502776883">
<p>iOS 18 introduced a new inactivity reboot security feature. What does it protect from and how does it work? This blog post covers all the details down to a kernel extension and the Secure Enclave Processor.</p><h2>Security Before First Unlock / After First Unlock</h2><p>Did you know that entering your passcode for the first time after your phone starts is something very different then entering it later on to unlock your phone?</p><p>When initially entering your passcode, this unlocks a key store in the Secure Enclave Processor (SEP) that encrypts your data on an iPhone.</p><p>The state before entering your passcode for the first time is also called <b>Before First Unlock</b> (BFU). Due to the encrypted user data, your iPhone behaves slightly differently to later unlocks. You'll see that Face ID and Touch ID won't work and that the passcode is required. But there's more subtle things you might notice: Since Wi-Fi passwords are encrypted, your iPhone won't connect to Wi-Fi networks. If your SIM is not PIN-protected, your iPhone will still connect to cellular networks. That means, technically, you can still receive phone calls. Yet, if you receive a call, even if that number is in your contacts, the contact name won't be shown, as the contacts haven't been decrypted yet. Similarly, when you receive notifications about new messages, you'll see that you got messages, but you won't see any message previews. You can easily try this yourself!</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEihQqOut8zLHRxuz_g8ornTF1A-X69IoWpX8lZPnZBisvc1t80zBRGebsCj4x4Vz_6C_i_ImG5AszaaQ-rXnFEJeB1-Dfaj4bSBwajxyKLYoKQNdJ8dZZtaqhexYUc1rZL7w_6yXkMj5APTe30fHOMRlg3da55UCxSZhmTFRLWmBEh_iWVgPSyKuVCEQ_48"><img alt="" data-original-height="3936" data-original-width="7142" height="352" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEihQqOut8zLHRxuz_g8ornTF1A-X69IoWpX8lZPnZBisvc1t80zBRGebsCj4x4Vz_6C_i_ImG5AszaaQ-rXnFEJeB1-Dfaj4bSBwajxyKLYoKQNdJ8dZZtaqhexYUc1rZL7w_6yXkMj5APTe30fHOMRlg3da55UCxSZhmTFRLWmBEh_iWVgPSyKuVCEQ_48=w640-h352" width="640"></a></p><p>In the <b>After First Unlock</b> (AFU) state, user data is decrypted. You can imagine this like a key safe that is kept open while iOS is running. Even when you see a lock screen, certain keys remain available to the operating system. This way, you stay connected to Wi-Fi networks and receive message notification previews, even when your iPhone is locked.</p><p>While it's more convenient, the AFU state is more susceptible to attacks. An attacker who can somehow bypass the lock screen can get access to decrypted data on the iPhone. To bypass the lock screen, an attacker does not necessarily need to know the passcode. Security vulnerabilities within iOS can allow attackers to get code execution and extract from an iPhone, even while it appears to be "locked".</p><p>Attackers with physical access to an iPhone have more security vulnerabilities to choose from. The attack surface is larger, as such attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in the USB stack or within wireless protocols, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or cellular, or even more invasive hardware attacks that involve opening the device. This larger attack surface tends to make exploits for these vulnerabilities cheaper on the gray market, as there's potentially more supply. Another factor that makes attacks cheaper is time ‚Äì vulnerabilities that are publicly known by the vendor and patched in more recent software versions won't unlock new iPhones, but can unlock iPhones that were kept in AFU state for a long time that didn't get any software updates.</p><h2>Rumors about Rebooting iPhones</h2><p>In law enforcement scenarios, a lot of the forensically relevant data is available in the AFU state. Law enforcement takes advantage of this and often keeps seized iPhones powered on, but isolated from the Internet, until they can extract data. This time might be necessary to wait for an exploit to be available or for legal reasons, such as getting a warrant.</p><p>However, thieves and other criminals are also interested in getting this kind of access after stealing a device. It gives them access to bank accounts and other valuable information, by far exceeding what the iPhone itself would be worth, or which might be used for blackmail. People reuse their passwords often, and getting access to the iCloud account may allow a thief to reset activation lock for the device, increasing the resale value.</p><p>A recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.404media.co/police-freak-out-at-iphones-mysteriously-rebooting-themselves-locking-cops-out/">news article by 404 media</a>&nbsp;(while paywalled, the most important information is also contained in the related&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/josephfcox/status/1854615490087551327">Tweet</a>)&nbsp;reported on a law enforcement document about suspicious iPhone reboots. This document makes two interesting claims:</p><ol><li>iPhones on iOS 18 will reboot, even when completely isolated from wireless networks.</li><li>iPhones on iOS 18 will tell other iPhones on lower iOS versions to reboot ‚Äì wirelessly!</li></ol><p>Especially the second claim would be huge if true. If anyone figured out how this works, they could build a large TV-Be-Gone for iPhones, forcing reboots over the air on hundreds of iPhones simultaneously. Would Apple really build such a feature into an iPhone?</p><p>Knowing a thing or two about the Apple wireless ecosystem, my interest was piqued, and I had to go down the rabbit hole!</p><h2>Discovery of Inactivity Reboot</h2><p>When Apple adds new features, they usually don't hide this very well. Apple software contains a lot of debug strings, which hint at new functionality. Blacktop maintains a <a href="https://github.com/blacktop/ipsw-diffs">git repository</a> of strings found in iOS, which keeps a nice version history. I decided to do the most low-effort thing I could think of: just search for "reboot".</p><div><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEi4XBZbJShDJ9GPps2OujHTkV_KZn-KcijaJX34M5GsyKk_TMRsUrYkxkft2LiAMa8V62VKXagqP5Q2lQntBlRo9lobsf-7qo39M-DzpWwGgfOioKq8LQs8xAnKIRNrC0b9RlA4FZWYQg4Q1yvcILbr_Lp_Nm0ULdRG9l13_sSB1R5JIP7eYJzYwy9QAwU2"><img alt="" data-original-height="1544" data-original-width="3000" height="330" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEi4XBZbJShDJ9GPps2OujHTkV_KZn-KcijaJX34M5GsyKk_TMRsUrYkxkft2LiAMa8V62VKXagqP5Q2lQntBlRo9lobsf-7qo39M-DzpWwGgfOioKq8LQs8xAnKIRNrC0b9RlA4FZWYQg4Q1yvcILbr_Lp_Nm0ULdRG9l13_sSB1R5JIP7eYJzYwy9QAwU2=w640-h330" width="640"></a></p><br></div><p>Bingo, that third hit looks good: "inactivity_reboot". The fact that it's in <span>keybagd</span> is interesting: this daemon is related to the key store that is unlocked on the first unlock.</p><p>A second search for only inactivity reboot shows the string starts occurring in iOS 18.1 and iOS 18.2. In iOS 18.2, the string changed from "inactivity_reboot" to "inactivity_reboot_enabled", hinting towards more potential changes in the latest iOS 18.2 betas.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgBjM82vk9aCJNzlk-9gbRKwc9y83Z9g9WZsPDUQXxB4oYXsuA-QntGrp4pMalJFUPFqETW0fxy3IfCrlziX946r_ymJ8G0a-mtIkFEzp1DoXPRcq9RUi1KOOtjgK8XfRJJcghzLLgNsM7JfvByjxqfWz2JqHPGEEkXpttCbMvdoCW7FPrfDU-psLHbdgD-"><img alt="" data-original-height="1194" data-original-width="2334" height="328" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgBjM82vk9aCJNzlk-9gbRKwc9y83Z9g9WZsPDUQXxB4oYXsuA-QntGrp4pMalJFUPFqETW0fxy3IfCrlziX946r_ymJ8G0a-mtIkFEzp1DoXPRcq9RUi1KOOtjgK8XfRJJcghzLLgNsM7JfvByjxqfWz2JqHPGEEkXpttCbMvdoCW7FPrfDU-psLHbdgD-=w640-h328" width="640"></a></p><p>Something that was still unclear to me at that point is: How long does it take for inactivity reboot to be triggered? A new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.404media.co/apple-quietly-introduced-iphone-reboot-code-which-is-locking-out-cops/">article by 404 media</a>&nbsp;claimed that it was 3-4 days. So I updated my SRD to the latest beta and made a time lapse.</p><p><iframe allowfullscreen="" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QOe2rDKOWMk" width="320" youtube-src-id="QOe2rDKOWMk"></iframe></p><p>Turns out, the inactivity reboot triggers exactly after 3 days (72 hours). The iPhone would do so despite being connected to Wi-Fi. This confirms my suspicion that this feature had nothing to do with wireless connectivity.</p><h2>Reverse Engineering Inactivity Reboot</h2><p>Let's reverse engineer what's changed! Which security guarantees does it provide?</p><p>Here is a high-level overview of what I found:</p><ul><li>The Secure Enclave Processor (SEP) keeps track on when your phone was last unlocked. If that last unlock time exceeds 3 days, the SEP tells the <span>AppleSEPKeyStore</span> kernel module that the time was exceeded.</li><li>The <span>AppleSEPKeyStore</span> kernel module informs user space to initiate a reboot. <span>SpringBoard</span> will then gracefully terminate all user-space processes. This prevents potential data loss upon reboot.</li><li>If the <span>AppleSEPKeyStore</span> kernel module finds the iPhone to still be powered on after it should have rebooted, the kernel will panic. This case should never happen, unless someone tries to tamper with inactivity reboot.</li><li>The <span>AppleSEPKeyStore</span> kernel module writes an NVRAM variable <span>aks-inactivity</span>. After the iPhone rebooted, <span>keybagd</span> reads this variable and, if set, sends an analytics event to Apple including how long the iPhone was not unlocked.</li></ul><p>The remainder of this post shows how I figured this out and what security implications the underlying design has.</p><h2>Indicators in Sysdiagnose</h2><p>From my search in ipsw-diffs, I knew there were some log messages that are printed on reboot. At the same time as I started looking them statically, I knew I had to see them actually logged for myself.</p><p>After my phone rebooted after three days, I took a sysdiagnose and searched for these messages. When doing this yourself, make sure that you unlocked the device before making the sysdiagnose. Otherwise, events from before the reboot will be missing.</p><p>In the&nbsp;<span>AppleSEPKeyStore</span>&nbsp;messages, there are the following entries around the inactivity reboot:</p><p><span>default</span><span>	</span><span>2024-11-17 01:35:14.341697 +0100</span><span>	</span><span>kernel</span><span>	</span><span>"AppleSEPKeyStore":3846:0: <span>notifying user space of inactivity reboot</span><br></span><span>default</span><span>	</span><span>2024-11-17 01:35:14.341766 +0100</span><span>	</span><span>kernel</span><span>	</span><span>"AppleSEPKeyStore":12598:31: operation failed (sel: 35 ret: e00002f0)<br></span><span>default</span><span>	</span><span>2024-11-17 01:35:14.342053 +0100</span><span>	</span><span>kernel</span><span>	</span><span>"AppleSEPKeyStore":12598:31: operation failed (sel: 35 ret: e00002f0)<br></span><span>default</span><span>	</span><span>2024-11-17 01:35:34.958218<br></span><span><span>[reboot occurs]</span><br>+0100</span><span>	</span><span>kernel</span><span>	</span><span>"AppleSEPKeyStore":331:0: starting (BUILT: Oct 26 2024 08:16:35) ("normal" variant üåΩ , 1827.60.43)<br></span><span>default</span><span>	</span><span>2024-11-17 01:35:34.958381 +0100</span><span>	</span><span>kernel</span><span>	</span><span>"AppleSEPKeyStore":476:0: _sep_enabled = 1</span></p><p>For more context, these are the unfiltered log messages before the reboot is initiated:</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjh3CycIuHLRgh46JB32Vr3WAFbEPzGzusiH_hWUUO248aoq27ntRBvDJuUhwVzF2O1p3BIYYhHoYam1IssPyBeI581bGm7frA4yFzIFA8gWerWJyuHfxDhRstUeo9eUcjG0xHcYoFeFi0S67dtuFRezYoJsz3ZMuhL5nce9o6jE7pH_Qb7tSedUNY0TxDn"><img alt="" data-original-height="1848" data-original-width="2518" height="470" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjh3CycIuHLRgh46JB32Vr3WAFbEPzGzusiH_hWUUO248aoq27ntRBvDJuUhwVzF2O1p3BIYYhHoYam1IssPyBeI581bGm7frA4yFzIFA8gWerWJyuHfxDhRstUeo9eUcjG0xHcYoFeFi0S67dtuFRezYoJsz3ZMuhL5nce9o6jE7pH_Qb7tSedUNY0TxDn=w640-h470" width="640"></a></p><h2>Reverse Engineering the <span>SEPKeyStore</span> Kernel Extension</h2><p>The latest iOS kernel can be downloaded using the following <a href="https://github.com/blacktop/ipsw"><span>ipsw</span></a> command:</p><p><span>ipsw download appledb --device iPhone17,3 --os iOS --version '18.2 beta 2' --kernel</span></p><p>This will download and decompress the kernel.

In the functions I identified, reboots are related to some SEP states. Could it be the SEP itself that checks the time?</p><h2>Reverse Engineering the Secure Enclave Processor</h2><p>The SEP is one of Apple's most protected secrets. In contrast to most other firmware on the iPhone, the firmware for the SEP is encrypted.</p><p>Luckily for us, <a href="https://twitter.com/nyan_satan">@nyan_satan</a> recently leaked <a href="https://theapplewiki.com/wiki/Keys:CrystalBSeed_22B5069a_(iPhone16,1)">SEP firmware encryption keys for iOS 18.1 beta 6</a>, just eta wen Apple introduced inactivity reboot. (Thank you!! üéâ And Apple, if you're reading this, why not ship the SEP unencrypted?) Using <span>ipsw</span>, we can download the SEP firmware as follows:</p><p><span>ipsw download appledb --device iPhone16,1 --os iOS --version '18.1 beta 6' --pattern "sep-firmware.d83.RELEASE.im4p"</span></p><p>With the leaked keys, we can decrypt the firmware:</p><p><span>pyimg4 im4p extract --iv 6705fb216080e19667dbcf71f532ae73 --key 4ea9db4c2e63a316a6854c83e2f5c81fd102ad40160b8998b5f9b16838b7116e -i sep-firmware.d83.RELEASE.im4p -o sep-firmware.d83.RELEASE.im4p.e</span></p><p>Loading this into Binary Ninja is a bit tricky. We can guess that the architecture is 64-bit ARM little endian. But there's no metadata where the firmware has to be loaded to. Being lazy and not wanting to spend time on writing a firmware loader, I used Binary Ninja's Triage feature to auto-detect the most likely address. Note that the firmware seems to have multiple fragments and there's multiple potential load addresses. I picked&nbsp;0x80090000ffc80000, which worked well for me.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEguwmjRE1k8u5npWzXhq5cs8lRMkyQqgECTzTuq_zaLuWDr5J8AyZtKkN64XixVpkczXFfSsQknPPclpjICoz7GrfRWBINwETutIXB-RF45-vlem8PavZPTyOTK4k6BmjTyY2l7xcTbmC1g6gooiaAe9DtqaiGavX0ajfnofIghAADa8xtmsLPe7bMNN-cW"><img alt="" data-original-height="580" data-original-width="514" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEguwmjRE1k8u5npWzXhq5cs8lRMkyQqgECTzTuq_zaLuWDr5J8AyZtKkN64XixVpkczXFfSsQknPPclpjICoz7GrfRWBINwETutIXB-RF45-vlem8PavZPTyOTK4k6BmjTyY2l7xcTbmC1g6gooiaAe9DtqaiGavX0ajfnofIghAADa8xtmsLPe7bMNN-cW=w355-h400" width="355"></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>There's only little known about the SEP.

What's good to know is that the SEP firmware is structured into apps, so I'm guessing the other base addresses the triage found may correspond to the other apps' address spaces. The app that communicates with the SEPKeyStore is called <span>sks</span> (see slide 86 of the presentation). Not a lot of information, but enough to start reverse engineering!</p><p>Looking at strings, it looks like the architecture of apps running inside the SEP hasn't changed much since 2016.

However, there's plenty of code. How do we focus on things that are related to the inactivity reboot?</p><p>Let's recall that we're looking for something that resembles 72 hours. In the kernel, times are usually measured in seconds or in microseconds. For example 72 hours are&nbsp;259200 seconds (0x3f480).

This design makes sense to me, since the SEP is involved in every unlock, and is also hardened against tampering, even if an exploit against the main kernel is used, so it's a good place to anchor a mitigation like this.</p></div><div><h2>A Mitigation Only Against Cops?</h2><h2><p>While the media coverage so far framed this mitigation as primarily targeting law enforcement, it also a huge security improvement against theft. Outdated law enforcement equipment often finds its way to eBay and other similar platforms for rather cheap price tags. However, thieves won't have the financial and legal means to obtain up-to-date exploits to unlock iPhones within 3 days of getting them. That's another reason why it's important to keep your device updated!</p><p>On the other hand, law enforcement can and will have to adjust their process, and act faster than before. The first forensic tooling companies already announced that they're able to coordinate these steps within 24 hours! (Note that this also indicates that they only have exploits for AFU state... ü§°)</p></h2><h2>Key Takeaways</h2></div><div><p>This feature is not at all related to wireless activity. The law enforcement document's conclusion that the reboot is due to phones wirelessly communicating with each other is implausible. The older iPhones before iOS 18 likely rebooted due to another reason, such as a software bug.</p><p>The time measurement and triggering of the reboot is in the SEP, which communicates with the <span>SEPKeyStore</span> kernel extension to perform the reboot. It is likely that using an external time source provided over the Internet or cellular networks to tamper with timekeeping will not influence the 3-day timer.</p><p>Security-wise, this is a very powerful mitigation. An attacker must have kernel code execution to prevent an inactivity reboot. This means that a forensic analyst might be able to delay the reboot for the actual data extraction, but the initial exploit must be run within the first three days.</p><p>Inactivity reboot will change the threat landscape for both thieves and forensic analysts, but asymmetrically so: while law enforcement is under more time pressure, it likely completely locks out criminals from accessing your data to get into your bank accounts and other valuable information stored on your iPhone.</p><p>Interested in reverse engineering?

<p>This post walks you through the step-by-step discovery of state-of-the-art positional encoding in transformer models. We will achieve
this by iteratively improving our approach to encoding position, arriving at <strong>Ro</strong>tary <strong>P</strong>ostional <strong>E</strong>ncoding (RoPE) used in the latest <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-3-2-connect-2024-vision-edge-mobile-devices/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LLama 3.2</a> release and most modern transformers. This post intends to limit the mathematical knowledge required to follow along, but some basic linear algebra, trigonometry and understanding of self attention is expected.</p>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You shall know a word by the company it keeps <br>
<!-- -->John Rupert Firth</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As with all problems, it is best to first start with understanding <strong>exactly</strong> what we are trying to achieve. The self attention mechanism in transformers is utilized to understand relationships
between tokens in a sequence. Self attention is a <strong>set</strong> operation, which
means it is <strong>permutation invariant</strong> (order does not matter). If we do not
enrich self attention with positional information, many important relationships are
<strong>incapable of being determined</strong>.</p>
<p>This is best demonstrated by example.</p>
<h2>Motivating Example</h2>
<p>Consider the following sentences:</p>
<p><span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mtable rowspacing="0.25em" columnalign="right" columnspacing=""><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="true"><mtext>The&nbsp;dog&nbsp;chased&nbsp;the&nbsp;cat</mtext></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="true"><mrow></mrow></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="true"><mtext>The&nbsp;cat&nbsp;chased&nbsp;the&nbsp;dog</mtext></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\begin{align*}

first tokenize them, map to the real token embeddings of <strong>Llama 3.2 1B</strong> and pass them

<p>As we can see, without any positional information, the output of a (multi
headed) self attention operation is <strong>identical</strong>, despite the different
word order and meaning. Let's begin designing a method of enhancing self attention with positional
information, such that it can determine relationships between words encoded by
their positions (i.e which mammal is chasing the other).</p>
<p>To understand and design an optimal encoding scheme, let's explore some desirable properties such a scheme should have.</p>
<h2>Desirable Properties</h2>
<p>Let's try and define some desirable properties that will make the optimization
process as easy as possible.</p>
<h4>Property 1 - Unique encoding for each position (across sequences)</h4>
<p>Each position needs a unique encoding that remains consistent regardless of sequence length - a token at position 5 should have the same encoding whether the current sequence is of length 10 or 10,000.</p>
<h4>Property 2 - Linear relation between two encoded positions</h4>
<p>The relationship between positions should be mathematically simple. If we know the encoding for position <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, it should be straightforward to compute the encoding for position <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p+k</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, making it easier for the model to learn positional patterns.</p>
<p>If you think about how we represent numbers on a number line, it's easy to understand that 5 is 2 steps away from 3, or that 10 is 5 steps from 15. The same intuitive relationship should exist in our encodings.</p>
<h4>Property 3 - Generalizes to longer sequences than those encountered in training</h4>
<p>To increase our models' utility in the real world, they should generalize outside
their training distribution. Therefore, our encoding scheme needs to be
adaptable enough to handle unexpected input lengths, without
violating any of our other desirable properties.</p>
<h4>Property 4 - Generated by a deterministic process the model can learn</h4>
<p>It would be ideal if our positional encodings could be drawn from a
deterministic process. This should allow the model to learn the mechanism
behind our encoding scheme efficiently.</p>
<h4>Property 5 - Extensible to multiple dimensions</h4>
<p>With multimodal models becoming the norm, it is crucial that our positional
encoding scheme can naturally extend from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mi>D</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1D</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi><mi>D</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">nD</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. This will allow models to consume data like images or brain scans, which are <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>2</mn><mi>D</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">2D</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>4</mn><mi>D</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">4D</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>
respectively.</p>
<p>Now we know the ideal properties (henceforth referred to as <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi><msub><mi>r</mi><mi>n</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">Pr_n</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>), let's start designing and iterating on our encoding scheme.</p>
<h2>Integer Position Encoding</h2>
<p>The first approach that may jump to mind is simply to add the integer value of the token position to each component of the token embedding, with values ranging from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn><mo>‚Üí</mo><mi>L</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0 \rightarrow L</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> where <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is the
length of our current sequence.</p>
<div><p><video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline=""><source src="https://fleetwood.dev/positional-encoding/IntegerEncoding.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></p></div>
<p>In the above animation, we create our positional encoding vector for the token <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mstyle mathcolor="#699C52"><mtext>chased</mtext></mstyle></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\color{#699C52}\text{chased}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> from the index and add it to our token embedding. The embedding values here are a subset of the real values from <strong>Llama 3.2 1B</strong>. We can observe that they're clustered around 0. This
is desirable to avoid <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse/courses/csc321_2017/readings/L15%20Exploding%20and%20Vanishing%20Gradients.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">vanishing or exploding gradients</a> during training and therefore is something we'd like to maintain throughout the model.</p>
<p>It's clear that our current na√Øve approach is going to cause problems. The magnitude of the position value
vastly exceeds the actual values of our input. This means the signal-to-noise
ratio is very low, and it's hard for the model to separate the semantic
information from the positional information.</p>
<p>With this new knowledge, a natural follow on might be to normalize the position value by <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mi>N</mi></mfrac></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{1}{N}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>. This constrains the values between 0 and 1, but introduces another problem. If we choose <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>N</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">N</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> to be the length of the current sequence, then the position values will be completely different for each sequence of differing lengths, violating <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi><msub><mi>r</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">Pr_1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.</p>
<p>Is there a better way to ensure our numbers are between 0 and 1?
If we thought really hard about this for a while, we might come up with switching
from decimal to binary numbers.</p>
<h2>Binary Position Encoding</h2>
<p>Instead of adding our (potentially normalized) integer position to each
component of the embedding, we could instead convert it into its binary
representation and <em>s t r e t c h</em> our value out to match our embedding dimension, as demonstrated below.</p>
<div><p><video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline=""><source src="https://fleetwood.dev/positional-encoding/BinaryEncoding.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></p></div>
<p>We've converted the position of interest (252) into its binary representation
(11111100) and added each bit to the corresponding component of the
token embedding. The least significant bit (LSB) will cycle between 0 and 1 for every
subsequent token, whilst the most significant bit (MSB) will cycle every
<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mn>2</mn><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>‚àí</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">2^{n-1}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> tokens where <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> is the number of bits.
You can see the positional encoding vector for different indices in the animation below <sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>.</p>
<div><p><video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline=""><source src="https://fleetwood.dev/positional-encoding/BinaryPositionalEncodingPlot.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></p></div>
<p>We've solved the value range problem, and we now have unique encodings that are
consistent across different sequence lengths. What happens if we plot a low dimensional version of our token embedding and visualize the addition of our binary positional vector for different values.</p>
<div><p><video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline=""><source src="https://fleetwood.dev/positional-encoding/BinaryVector3D.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></p></div>
<p>We can see that the result is very "jumpy" (as we might expect from the
discrete nature of binary). The optimization process likes smooth, continuous and
predictable changes. Do we know any functions with similar value ranges that are smooth and continuous?</p>
<p>If we looked around a little, we might notice that both <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>sin</mi><mo>‚Å°</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\sin</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>cos</mi><mo>‚Å°</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\cos</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> fit the bill!</p>
<h2>Sinusoidal positional encoding</h2>
<div><p><video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline=""><source src="https://fleetwood.dev/positional-encoding/SteppedPositionalEncodingPlot.mp4" type="video/mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></p></div>
<p>The above animation visualizes our position embedding if each component is
alternatively drawn from <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>sin</mi><mo>‚Å°</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\sin</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>cos</mi><mo>‚Å°</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\cos</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> with gradually increasing
wavelengths. If you compare it with the previous animation, you'll notice a striking similarity!</p>
<p>We've now arrived at Sinusoidal embeddings; originally defined in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Attention is all you need</a> paper.

I encourage you to plug in some realistic values to get a feel for this
geometric progression.</p>
<p>There's a few parts of this equation that are confusing at first glance. How did the

<p>It seems that using <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>10</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>000</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">10,000</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> for the base wavelength was determined experimentally <sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>.

for our iterative approach to understanding. The key here is our desire for a linear relation between two encoded positions (<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi><msub><mi>r</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">Pr_2</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>).

It took another <strong>4 years</strong> to go from Sinusoidal Encoding to RoPE, despite rotations already being on the table...</p>
<h2>Absolute vs Relative Position Encoding</h2>
<p>With the knowledge in hand that rotations are important here, let's
return to our motivating example and try to discover some intuitions for our next iteration.</p>

With Sinusoidal Encoding, we
generated a separate vector which represents the absolute position,
and using some trigonometric trickery we were able to encode relative positions.</p>
<p>When we're trying to understand these sentences, does it matter that <em>this</em> word is the 2149th word in this blog post? Or do we care about its relationship to the words around it? The absolute position of a word rarely matters for meaning - what matters is how words relate to each other.</p>
<h2>Positional encoding in context</h2>
<p>From this point on, it's key to consider positional encoding <strong>in the context of</strong>
self attention. To reiterate, the self-attention mechanism enables the model to weigh the importance of different elements in an input sequence and dynamically adjust their influence on the output.</p>
<p><span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mtext>Attn</mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>Q</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>K</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>V</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mtext>softmax</mtext><mrow><mo fence="true">(</mo><mfrac><mrow><mi>Q</mi><msup><mi>K</mi><mi>T</mi></msup></mrow><msqrt><msub><mi>d</mi><mi>k</mi></msub></msqrt></mfrac><mo fence="true">)</mo></mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\text{Attn}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span></p><p>In all our previous iterations, we've generated a separate positional encoding
vector and <strong>added</strong> it to our token embedding prior to our <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>Q</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">Q</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>K</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">V</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> projections.
By adding the positional information directly to our token embedding, we are
<strong>polluting</strong> the semantic information with the positional information. We should
be attempting to encode the information without modifying the norm. Shifting to multiplicative is the
key.</p>
<p>Using the dictionary analogy, when looking up a word (query) in our dictionary (keys), nearby words should have more influence than distant ones. The influence of one token upon another is determined by the <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>Q</mi><msup><mi>K</mi><mi>T</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">QK^T</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> dot product - so that's exactly where we should focus our positional encoding!</p>

We can modulate the result of our dot product of two vectors purely by
increasing or decreasing the angle between them. Furthermore, by rotating the
vector, we have absolutely zero impact on the norm of the vector, which encodes
the semantic information of our token.</p>
<p>So now we know where to focus our <em>attention</em>, and have seen from another <em>angle</em> why a
rotation might be a sensible "channel" in which to encode our positional
information, let's put it all together!</p>
<h2><strong>Ro</strong>tary <strong>P</strong>ostional <strong>E</strong>ncoding</h2>
<p><strong>Ro</strong>tary <strong>P</strong>ostional <strong>E</strong>ncoding or RoPE was defined in the
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.09864" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">RoFormer paper</a> (<a href="https://x.com/bojone1993" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Jianlin Su</a> designed it independently on his blog <a href="https://kexue.fm/archives/8130" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://kexue.fm/archives/8265" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>).
While it may seem like voodoo if you skip to the end result, by thinking about Sinusoidal Encoding in the
context of self attention (and more specifically dot products), we can see how
it all comes together.</p>
<p>Much like in Sinusoidal Encoding, we decompose our vectors (<span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold">q</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{q}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> or <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold">k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{k}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, instead of pre-projection <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold">x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{x}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>) into 2D pairs/chunks. Rather than encoding <em>absolute</em> position directly by adding a vector we drew from sinusoidal functions of slowly decreasing frequencies, we cut to the chase and encode <em>relative</em> position by <strong>multiplying each pair with the rotation matrix</strong>.</p>
<p>Let <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold">q</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{q}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> or <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold">k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{k}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> be our input vector at position <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>.

<p>In practice, we don't use a matrix multiplication to compute RoPE as it would be
computationally inefficient with such a sparse matrix. Instead, we can directly apply the rotations to pairs of elements independently, taking advantage of the regular pattern in the computation:</p>

<h2>Extending RoPE to <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>-Dimensions</h2>
<p>We've explored the <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mi>D</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1D</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> case for RoPE and by this point I hope you've gained an
intuitive understanding of an admittedly unintuitive component of transformers.
Finally, let's explore extending it to higher dimensions, such as images.</p>
<p>A natural first intuition could be to directly use the <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo fence="true">[</mo><mtable rowspacing="0.16em" columnalign="center" columnspacing="1em"><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mi>x</mi></mstyle></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mstyle scriptlevel="0" displaystyle="false"><mi>y</mi></mstyle></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo fence="true">]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex"> \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> coordinate pairs from the image. This might seem intuitive, after all, we were almost arbitrarily pairing up our components previously. However, this would be a mistake!</p>
<p>In the <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mi>D</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1D</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> case, we encode the relative position <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>‚àí</mo><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m - n</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> through a rotation of pairs
of values from our input vector. For <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>2</mn><mi>D</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">2D</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> data, we need to encode both horizontal and vertical relative positions, say <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>‚àí</mo><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m - n</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>‚àí</mo><mi>j</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">i - j</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> independently. RoPE's brilliance lies in how it handles multiple dimensions. Instead of trying to encode all positional information in a single rotation, we pair components <strong>within the same dimension</strong> and rotate those, otherwise we would be intermixing the <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">y</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> offset information. By handling each dimension independently, we maintain the natural structure of the space. This can generalize to as many dimensions as required!</p>
<h2>The future of positional encoding</h2>
<p>Is RoPE the final incarnation of positional encoding? This <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.06205" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recent paper</a> from DeepMind deeply analyses RoPE and highlights some fundamental problems.</p>
<p>I anticipate some future breakthroughs, perhaps taking inspiration from
signal processing with ideas like wavelets or hierarchical implementations. As models
are increasingly quantized for deployment, I'd also expect to see some
innovation in encoding schemes that remain robust under low-precision arithmetic.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Positional encoding has and continues to be treated as an after thought in
transformers. I believe we should view it differently - self attention has an
Achilles heel that has been repeatedly patched.</p>
<p>I hope this blog post showed you that you too could have discovered state of the
art positional encoding, despite it being unintuitive at first. In a follow up
post I'd love to explore practical implementation details for RoPE in order to
maximise performance.</p>
<p>Thanks to Madeline Ephgrave for proof reading this.</p>

            <p>Twitter users @tthirtle asked why Windows 95 setup goes through three operating systems: MS-DOS, Windows 3.1, and then Windows 95. Why not go from MS-DOS straight to Windows 95?</p>
<blockquote data-conversation="none">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Here‚Äôs another good question. Why does Windows 95 setup use 3 different UI‚Äôs. DOS,Win3.x,and Win9x?</p>

<p>Windows 95 setup could upgrade from three starting points: MS-DOS, Windows 3.1, or Windows 95. (Yes, you could upgrade Windows 95 to Windows 95. You might do this to repair a corrupted system while preserving data.)</p>
<p>One option is to write three versions of Windows 95 setup: One for setting up from MS-DOS, another for setting up from Windows 3.1, and a third for setting up from Windows 95.</p>
<p>This was not a pleasant option because you basically did the same work three times, but implemented separately, so you have to do three times the coding.</p>
<p>A better option is to just write one version of Windows 95 setup and use it for all three starting points. So now you get to choose the platform on which to base your code.</p>

<p>If you write Windows 95 setup as an MS-DOS app, then it runs on all three platforms. That‚Äôs great! You need to write only one setup program. The downside is that it‚Äôs going to be a text-mode setup program, which looks ugly and gives a poor initial impression of what is supposed to be a brand new GUI world.</p>
<p>At the other extreme, you can write Windows 95 setup as a 32-bit GUI program, but that means that if the user is starting from MS-DOS or Windows 3.1, you have to install Windows 95 before you can run Windows 95 setup, which is a bit of a catch-22.</p>
<p>In the middle is the happy medium: You can have the MS-DOS setup program install a minimal version of Windows 3.1, just barely enough to support what the 16-bit GUI setup program needs.¬π This tiny version is small enough to be copied and installed off a small number of floppy disks. Once that‚Äôs done, boot into the tiny version of Windows 3.1 and run the 16-bit GUI setup program.</p>
<p>Okay, so now we have three setup programs. The first one is used if you‚Äôre installing from MS-DOS: It installs the tiny version of Windows 3.1, and then boots into Windows 3.1 to continue to the next step.</p>
<p>The second setup program runs as a 16-bit Windows app, either in the miniature copy of Windows 3.1 (if the user is upgrading from MS-DOS), the real copy of Windows 3.1 (if the user is upgrading from Windows 3.1), or the real copy of Windows 95 (if the user is upgrading from Windows 95). This second setup program is the one that does almost all of the real work: It does the initial interaction with the user to gather information about how to install Windows 95, like asking which optional components to include, and does hardware detection to decide which drivers to install.¬≤ And then it copies the drivers and Windows 95 files onto the system, migrates your old settings to the new operating system, and boots into Windows 95.</p>
<p>The third setup program runs as a 32-bit Windows app. It is running in the real Windows 95 system and does some final steps that require operation a live running system, like installing printers.</p>

<p>So that‚Äôs why Windows 95 setup is really three setup programs chained together. It allows a single copy of the code to be used for all three of the installation scenarios. Each program takes you one step closer to the goal. And everything got implemented only once.</p>
<p>¬π There was existing precedent for a tiny version of Windows that is barely enough to run a single program. The original Windows version of Microsoft Excel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Microsoft_Excel&amp;oldid=166461028"> came with a runtime version of Windows 2.1</a>, so that customers who didn‚Äôt have Windows could still use Excel.</p>
<p>¬≤ This hardware detection code that Setup uses is the same code that runs when you do hardware detection from within Windows 95 itself, so even that code needed to be written only once. It did have some runtime checks to change behavior slightly depending on whether it‚Äôs running in Windows 3.1 or Windows 95, but the vast majority of the code is identical.</p>
