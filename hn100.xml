<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="In Praise of “Normal” Engineers"><p><em>A version of this post <a href="https://refactoring.fm/p/in-praise-of-normal-engineers" target="_blank">originally appeared</a> in <a href="https://refactoring.fm/about" target="_blank">Refactoring</a>, a Substack offering advice for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/software-engineers">software engineers</a>. </em><br></p><p>Most of us have encountered a few software engineers who seem practically magician-like, a class apart from the rest of us in their ability to reason about complex mental models, leap to nonobvious yet elegant solutions, or emit waves of high-quality code at unreal velocity. </p><p>I have run into many of these incredible beings over the course of my career. I think their existence is what explains the curious durability of the notion of a “10x engineer,” someone who is 10 times as productive or skilled as their peers. The idea<span>—</span>which has <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/10x-engineer" target="_blank">become a meme</a><span><span>—is</span> based on </span><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/362851.362858" target="_blank">flimsy, shoddy research</a><span>, and the claims people have made to defend it have often been risible (for example, 10x engineers have dark backgrounds, are rarely seen doing user-interface work, and are poor mentors and interviewers) or blatantly double down on stereotypes (“we look for young dudes in hoodies who remind us of Mark Zuckerberg”). But damn if it doesn’t resonate with experience. It just feels true.</span></p><p>I don’t have a problem with the idea that there are engineers who are 10 times as productive as other engineers. The problems I do have are twofold.</p><h2>Measuring productivity is fraught and imperfect</h2><p>First, how are you measuring productivity? I have a problem with the implication that there is One True Metric of productivity that you can standardize and sort people by. Consider the magnitude of skills and experiences at play: </p><ul><li>Are you working on <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/microprocessors">microprocessors</a>, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/iot">IoT</a>, database internals, Web services, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/user-experience">user experience</a>, mobile apps<span>—</span>what? </li><li>Are you using <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2024" target="_blank">Golang, Python, Cobol, or Lisp</a>? Which version, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/libraries">libraries</a>, and frameworks? What other software must you have mastered? </li><li>What adjacent skills, market segments, and product subject matter expertise are you drawing upon? Design, security, compliance, data visualization, marketing, finance? </li><li>What stage of development? What scale of usage? Are you writing for a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/mars">Mars</a> rover, or shrink-wrapped software you can never change? </li></ul><p><span>Also, people and their skills and abilities are not static. At one point, I was a pretty good database reliability engineer. Maybe I was even a 10x database engineer then, but certainly not now. I haven’t debugged a query plan in <em>years</em>.</span></p><p><span>“10x engineer” makes it sound like productivity is an immutable characteristic of a person. But someone who is a 10x engineer in a particular skill set is still going to have infinitely more areas where they are average (or below average). I know a lot of world-class engineers, but I’ve never met anyone who is 10 times better than everyone else across the board, in every situation.</span></p><h2>Engineers don’t own software, teams own software</h2><p><span>Second, and even more importantly: So what? Individual engineers don’t own <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/software-engineering">software; engineering</a> teams own software. It doesn’t matter how fast an individual engineer can write software. What matters is how fast the team can collectively write, test, review, ship, maintain, refactor, extend, architect, and revise the software that they own. </span></p><p><span>Everyone uses the same software delivery pipeline. If it takes the slowest engineer at your company five hours to ship a single line of code, it’s going to take the fastest engineer at your company five hours to ship a single line of code. The time spent writing code is typically dwarfed by the time spent on <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/twitters-tips-for-making-software-engineers-more-efficient" target="_blank">every other part</a> of the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/software-development">software development</a> lifecycle. </span></p><p><span>If you have services or software components that are owned by a single engineer, that person is a single point of failure. </span></p><p><span>I’m not saying this should never happen. It’s quite normal at <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/startups">startups</a> to have individuals owning software, because the biggest existential risk that you face is not moving fast enough and going out of business. But as you start to grow as a company, ownership needs to get handed over to a team. Individual engineers get sick, go on vacation, and leave the company, and the business has to be resilient to that. </span></p><p><span>When a team owns the software, then the key job of any engineering leader is to craft a high-performing engineering team. If you must 10x something, build 10x engineering teams.</span></p><h2>The best engineering organizations are the ones where normal engineers can do great work</h2><p><span>When people talk about world-class engineering organizations, they often have in mind teams that are top-heavy with staff and principal engineers, or that recruit heavily from the ranks of former <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/big-tech">Big Tech</a> employees and top universities. But I would argue that a truly great engineering org is one where you don’t have to be one of the “best” or most pedigreed engineers to have a lot of impact on the business. I think it’s actually the other way around. A truly great engineering organization is one where perfectly normal, workaday software engineers, with decent skills and an ordinary amount of expertise, can consistently move fast, ship code, respond to users, understand the systems they’ve built, and move the business forward a little bit more, day by day, week by week.</span></p><p><span>Anyone can build an org where the most experienced, brilliant engineers in the world can <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/product-management-career" target="_blank">create products</a> and make progress. That’s not hard. And putting all the spotlight on individual ability has a way of letting your leaders off the hook from doing their jobs. It is a huge competitive advantage if you can build systems where less experienced engineers can convert their effort and energy into product and business momentum. And the only meaningful measure of productivity is whether or not you are moving the business materially forward. </span></p><p><span>A truly great engineering org also happens to be one that mints world-class software engineers. But I’m getting ahead of myself here. </span></p><h2>Let’s talk about “normal” engineers</h2><p><span>A lot of technical people got really attached to our identities as smart kids. The software industry tends to reflect and reinforce this preoccupation at every turn, as seen in Netflix’s claim that “we look for the top 10 percent of global talent” or Coinbase’s desire to “hire the top 0.1 percent.” I would like to challenge us to set that baggage to the side and think about ourselves as</span><span></span><em>normal</em><span> people.</span></p><p><span>It can be humbling to think of yourself as a normal person. But most of us are, and there is <em>nothing wrong with that</em>. Even those of us who are certified geniuses on certain criteria are likely quite normal in other ways—kinesthetic, emotional, spatial, musical, linguistic, and so on. </span></p><p><span>Software engineering both selects for and develops certain types of intelligence, particularly around abstract reasoning, but <em>nobody</em> is born a great software engineer. Great engineers are made, not born. </span></p><h2>Build sociotechnical systems with “normal people” in mind </h2><p><span>When it comes to hiring talent and building teams, yes, absolutely, we should focus on identifying the ways people are exceptional. But when it comes to building sociotechnical systems for software delivery, we should focus on all the ways people are <em>normal</em>. </span></p><p><span>Normal people have <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/engineering-bias-out-of-ai" target="_blank">cognitive biases</a>—confirmation bias, recency bias, hindsight bias. We work hard, we care, and we do our best; but we also forget things, get impatient, and zone out. Our eyes are inexorably drawn to the color red (unless we are colorblind). We develop habits and resist changing them. When we see the same text block repeatedly, we stop reading it.</span></p><p><span>We are embodied beings who can get overwhelmed and fatigued. If an alert wakes us up at 3 a.m., we are much more likely to make mistakes while responding to that alert than if we tried to do the same thing at 3 p.m. Our emotional state can affect the quality of our work. </span></p><p><span>When your systems are designed to be used by normal engineers, all that excess brilliance they have can get poured into the product itself, instead of wasting it on navigating the system.</span></p><h2>Great engineering orgs mint world-class engineers </h2><p><span>A great engineering organization is one where you don’t have to be one of the best engineers in the world to have a lot of impact. But—rather ironically—great engineering orgs mint world-class engineers like nobody’s business. </span></p><p><span>The best engineering orgs are not the ones with the smartest, most experienced people in the world. They’re the ones where normal software engineers can consistently make progress, deliver value to users, and move the business forward. </span><span>Places where engineers can </span><span>have a large impact are a magnet for top performers. Nothing makes engineers happier than building things, solving problems, and making progress.</span></p><p><span>If you’re lucky enough to have world-class engineers in your organization, good for you! Your role as a leader is to leverage their brilliance for the good of your customers and your other engineers, without coming to <em>depend</em> on their brilliance. After all, these people don’t belong to you. They may walk out the door at any moment, and that has to be okay. </span></p><p><span>These people can be phenomenal assets, assuming they can be team players and keep their egos in check. That’s probably why so many tech companies seem to obsess over identifying and hiring them, especially in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/silicon-valley">Silicon Valley</a>.</span></p><p><span>But companies attach too much importance to finding these people after they’ve already been minted, which ends up reinforcing and replicating all the prejudices and inequities of the world at large. Talent may be evenly distributed across populations, but opportunity is not. </span></p><h2>Don’t hire the “best” people. Hire the right people</h2><p><span>We place too much emphasis on individual agency and characteristics, and not enough on the systems that shape us and inform our behaviors. </span></p><p><span>I believe a whole slew of issues (candidates self-selecting out of the interview process, diversity of applicants, and more) would be improved simply by shifting the focus of hiring away from this inordinate emphasis on hiring the <em>best </em>people and realigning around the more reasonable and accurate <em>right </em>people. </span></p><p><span>It’s a competitive advantage to build an environment where people can be hired for their unique strengths, not their lack of weaknesses; where the emphasis is on composing teams; where inclusivity is a given both for ethical reasons and because it raises the bar for performance for everyone. Inclusive culture is what meritocracy depends on. </span></p><p><span>This is the kind of place that engineering talent is drawn to like a moth to a flame. It feels good to move the business forward, sharpen your skills, and improve your craft. It’s the kind of place that people go when they want to become world-class engineers. And it tends to be the kind of place where world-class engineers want to stick around and train the next generation.</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>In the comments on <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2025/02/12/books-on-the-history-of-mathematics-some-thoughts/">my recent post on books on the history of maths </a>Fernando Q. Gouvêa jumped in to draw attention to the book&nbsp;<em>Math Through the Ages</em>:&nbsp;<em>A Gentle History for Teachers and Others</em>, which he coauthored with William P. Berlinghoff. I had not come across this book before, as I noted in my post I gave up reading general histories of maths long ago, so, I went looking and came across the following glowing recommendation:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“<em>Math&nbsp;Through&nbsp;the&nbsp;Ages</em>&nbsp;is a treasure, one of the best history of&nbsp;math&nbsp;books at its level ever written. Somehow, it manages to stay true to a surprisingly sophisticated story, while respecting the needs of its audience. Its overview of the subject captures most of what one needs to know, and the 30 sketches are small gems of exposition that stimulate further exploration.” — Glen Van Brummelen, Quest University&nbsp;</p>

<p>Glen Van Brummelen is an excellent historian of maths and regular readers will already know that I’m a very big fan of his books on the history of trigonometry, <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2021/12/08/ohms-or-everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-the-history-of-trigonometry-and-didnt-know-who-to-ask/">which I reviewed here.</a> Intrigued I decided to acquire a copy and see if it lives up to Glen’s description. The book that I acquired is the paperback Dover reprint from 2019 of the second edition from Oxton House Publishers, Farmington, Maine, it has a recommended price in the USA of $18, which is certainly affordable for its intended audience, school, college and university students. The cover blurb says, “Designed for students just beginning their study of the discipline…”</p>

<p>The book distinguishes itself by not being a long continuous narrative covering the chronological progress of the historical development of mathematics, the usual format of one volume histories. Instead, it opens with a comparatively brief such survey, just fifty-eight pages entitled,&nbsp;<em>The History of Mathematics in a Large Nutshell</em>, before presenting the thirty sketches mentioned by Van Brummelen in his recommendation. These are brief expositions of single topics from the history of maths, each one conceived and presented as a complete, independent pedagogical unit. The sketches however contain references to other units where a term or concept used in the current unit is explained more fully. Normally when reviewing books, I usually leave the discussion of the bibliography till the end of my review but in this case the bibliography is an integral part of the unit presentation. The bibliography contains one hundred and eighty numbered&nbsp;&nbsp;titles listed alphabetically by the authors’ names. At the end of each sketch there is a list of numbers of the titles where the reader can find more information on the topic of the sketch. Within the sketches themselves this recommendation system is also applied to single themes. The interaction between sketches and bibliography is a very central aspect of the books pedagogical structure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given its very obvious limitations, my own far from complete survey of the history of mathematics now occupies more than two metres of bookshelf space and that is not counting the numerous books on the histories of astronomy, physics, navigation, cartography, technology and so forth, which I own, that contain elements on the history of mathematics, the&nbsp;<em>Large Nutshell</em>&nbsp;is actually reasonably good. It sketches the development of mathematics in Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, Ancient Greece, India, and the Islamic Empires, before leaping to Europe in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and from there is fairly large steps down to the present day. Naturally, a lot gets left out that other authors might have considered important but it still manages to give a general feeling of the depth and breadth of the history of mathematics. The real work begins with the&nbsp;<em>Sketches</em>.</p>



<p>Sketch No.1 is naturally&nbsp;<em>Keeping Count</em>:&nbsp;<em>Writing Whole Numbers</em>. Our authors deliver competent but brief accounts of the Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Mayan, Roman and Hindu-Arabic number systems but don’t consider the Greek system worth mentioning. They of course emphasise the difficulty of calculating with Roman numerals, as everybody does, but at least mention the calculation was actually done with a counting board or abacus, without seeming to realise that abacus is the Greek name for a counting board, an error that leads them to a stupid statement in another sketch. They also don’t mention that everybody, Mesopotamians, Greeks, Egyptians etc used counting boards to do calculations. They of course mention this in order to emphasise the advantages of the Hindu-Arabic numerals for doing calculations on paper, which leads to another error later.</p>



<p>Sketch No.2&nbsp;<em>Reading and Writing Arithmetic</em>:&nbsp;<em>The Basic Symbols</em>&nbsp;now makes a big leap to the introduction of symbolic arithmetic in the Renaissance to replace the previous rhetorical arithmetic. This precedes chronologically through the various innovations, including, unfortunately, the myth that Robert Recorde was the first to introduce the equal’s sign. Is OK, but they admit that their brief sketch skips over many, many symbols that were used from time to time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Almost predictably, Sketch No.3 is&nbsp;<em>Nothing Becomes a Number</em>:&nbsp;<em>The Story of Zero</em>. We start with the Babylonians, who had a place value number system, and after a long time without one, introduced a place holder zero. We then spring to India and from them straight to the Arabs and the logistic origins of the word zero before being served up the first major error in the book. Our authors tell us:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>By the 9<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century A.D., the Indians had made a conceptual leap that ranks as one of the most important mathematical events of all time. They had begun to recognise&nbsp;<em>sunya</em>, the absence of quantity, as a quantity in its own right! That is, they had begun to treat zero as a number. For instance, the mathematician Mahāvīra wrote that a number multiplied by zero results&nbsp;&nbsp;in zero, and that zero subtracted from a number leaves the number unchanged. He also claimed that a number divided by zero remain unchanged. A couple of centuries later. Bhāskara declared, a number divided by zero to be an infinite quantity.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is quite frankly bizarre! Already in the 628 CE, Brahmagupta (c. 598–c. 668) had in Chater 12 of his&nbsp;<em>Brāhma-sphu</em><em>ṭ</em><em>a-siddhānta</em>&nbsp;given the rules for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with positive and negative numbers and zero in the same way as they can be found in any elementary arithmetic textbook today, with the exception that he defined division by zero. His work was well known in India. In fact,&nbsp;Bhāskara II, mentioned by our authors, based his account on that of Brahmagupta. His work was also translated into Arabic in the eight century and provided the basis for al-Khwārimī’s account, which has not survived in Arabic but was translated into Latin in the twelfth century as&nbsp;<em>Dixit Algorizmi</em>, which was the first introduction of the Hindu-Arabic number system in Europe, as is noted by our authors. Our authors then over emphasise the reluctance of some European mathematicians to accept zero as a number, whilst introducing Thomas Harriot’s method for solving polynomials and zero as a defining property of rings and fields.</p>



<p>Sketch No.4&nbsp;<em>Broken Numbers</em>:<em>&nbsp;Writing Fractions</em>&nbsp;is a quite good account of their history considering its brevity.</p>



<p>Sketch No.5&nbsp;<em>Less than Nothing</em>:&nbsp;<em>Negative Numbers</em>&nbsp;is also a reasonably good account of the very problematic history of accepting the existence of negative numbers. Somewhat bizarrely, having totally ignored him on the topic of zero, our authors now state that:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>A prominent Indian mathematician, Brahmagupta, recognised and worked with negative quantities to some extent as early as the 7<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century. He treated positive numbers as possessions and negative numbers as debts, and also stated rules for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing with negative numbers.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s the same section of his book where he deals with zero as a number!</p>



<p>Sketch No. 6&nbsp;<em>By Ten and Tenths</em>:&nbsp;<em>Metric Measurement</em>&nbsp;is a good brief account of the French introduction of the metric system and its subsequent modernisation. I would have appreciated a brief nod for the English, polymath John Wilkins (1614–1672), who advocated for a metric system already in the seventeenth century.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sketch No. 7&nbsp;<em>Measuring the Circle</em>:&nbsp;<em>The Story of&nbsp;</em><em>π</em>&nbsp;a simple brief account. An interesting addition is a table showing the size of the error in calculating the circumference of a circular lake with a diameter of one kilometre using different historical values for&nbsp;π.</p>



<p>Sketch No. 8&nbsp;<em>The Cossic Art</em>:&nbsp;<em>Writing Algebra with Symbols</em>&nbsp;is a competent sketch of the gradual but zig zag transition from rhetorical to symbolic algebra.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sketch No. 9&nbsp;<em>Linear Thinking</em>:&nbsp;<em>Solving First Degree Equations</em>&nbsp;starts with the Egyptians mentions the Chinese but completely ignores the Babylonians. It then wanders off into an account of the false proposition method of solution.</p>



<p>Sketch No. 10&nbsp;<em>A Square and Things</em>:&nbsp;<em>Quadratic Equations</em>&nbsp;after one dimension we move onto two dimensions. This is devoted to al- Khwārimī’s discussion of methods of solving quadratic equations completely ignoring the fact that the Babylonians had the general solution of the quadratic equation a thousand years earlier, albeit in a different form to the one we teach schoolchildren and, of course ignoring negative solutions. Every worse ignoring&nbsp;&nbsp;the fact that Brahmagupta had the general solution in the form we use today including negative solutions!</p>



<p>Sketch No. 11&nbsp;<em>Intrigue in Renaissance Italy</em>:&nbsp;<em>Solving Cubic Equations</em>&nbsp;and now onto three dimensions. We start with the Ancient Geek problem of trisecting an angle and then surprisingly, considering that this is supposed to be “for students just beginning their study of the subject,” we suddenly get a piece of fairly advanced trigonometry blasted into the text:</p>



<p>cos(3𝛂) = 4 cos<sup>3</sup>(𝛂) – 3 cos(𝛂)</p>



<p>to point out that the solution can be found with a cubic equation!</p>



<p>We move on to Omar Khayyám and his solution of cubic equations using conic sections. We then get a mangled version of the Antonio Fiore/Tartaglia challenge. Out authors claim that Tartaglia bragged that he could solve cubic equations and so Fiore, who had learnt the solution from his teacher&nbsp;Scipione del Ferro, challenged him to a mathematical contest. In fact, Tartaglia didn’t know how to solve them when challenged by Fiore and realising he was onto a hiding to nothing sat down and discovered how to solve them. End result victory for Tartaglia. They get the rest of the story right. How Cardano persuaded Tartaglia to reveal his solution after promising not to publish it before Tartaglia did. Then discovering that Scipione del Ferro had discovered the solution before Tartaglia, and having extended Tartaglia’s solution, went on and published anyway, although giving full credit to Tartaglia for his work. You can read the whole story here. Our authors, however, contradict themselves. In their&nbsp;<em>Large Nutshell</em>&nbsp;they gave a brief version of the story and wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Once he knew Tartaglia’s method for solving some cubic equations. Cardano was able to generalise it to a way of solving any cubic equation. Felling he had made a contribution of his own, Cardano decided he was no longer bound by his promise of secrecy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Now in Sketch 11 they write:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>At this point, Cardano knew that he had made a real contribution to mathematics. But how could he publish it without breaking his promise? He found a way. He discovered that del Ferro had found the solution of a crucial case before Tartaglia had. Since he had the not promised to keep&nbsp;<em>del Ferro’s</em>&nbsp;solution secret, he felt he could publish it, even though it was identical to the one he had learnt from Tartaglia.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We then get Cardano’s discovery of conjugate pairs of complex numbers sometimes in the solutions of cubic equations and a somewhat confused explanation of his reaction to them. Our authors tell us that Cardano wrote to Tartaglia and asked him about the problem and Tartaglia simply suggest that Cardano had not understood how to solve such problems. This is true, quoting MacTutor:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>One of the first problems that Cardan hit was that the formula sometimes involved square roots of negative numbers even though the answer was a ‘proper’ number. On&nbsp;4&nbsp;August&nbsp;1539&nbsp;Cardan wrote to Tartaglia:-</p>



<p><em>I have sent to enquire after the solution to various problems for which you have given me no answer, one of which concerns the cube equal to an unknown plus a number. I have certainly grasped this rule, but when the cube of one-third of the coefficient of the unknown is greater in value than the square of one-half of the number, then, it appears, I cannot make it fit into the equation.</em></p>



<p>Indeed, Cardan gives precisely the conditions here for the formula to involve square roots of negative numbers. Tartaglia, by this time, greatly regretted telling Cardan the method and tried to confuse him with his reply&nbsp;(although in fact Tartaglia, like Cardan, would not have understood the complex numbers now entering into mathematics):-</p>



<p><em>… and thus, I say in reply that you have not mastered the true way of solving problems of this kind, and indeed I would say that your methods are totally false.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Our authors simply move on to state, It fell to Rafael Bombelli to resolve the issue.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is selling Cardano short, firstly he was well aware that if one multiplies complex conjugate pairs together the imaginary term disappears as he demonstrated in Ars Magna, he simply thought that it didn’t make sense, mathematically.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Dismissing mental tortures, and multiplying&nbsp;</em>5<em>&nbsp;</em><em>+ √-</em>15<em>&nbsp;</em><em>by&nbsp;</em>5<em>&nbsp;</em><em>– √-</em>15<em>, we obtain&nbsp;</em>25<em>&nbsp;</em><em>–&nbsp;</em>(<em>–</em>15)<em>. Therefore the product is&nbsp;</em>40<em>. …. and thus far does arithmetical subtlety go, of which this, the extreme, is, as I have said, so subtle that it is useless.</em>&nbsp;(MacTutor)</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Secondly, Bombelli used Cardano’s work as the starting point for his own work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sketch No. 12&nbsp;<em>A Cheerful Fact</em>:&nbsp;<em>The Pythagorean Theorem</em>&nbsp;This is a reasonable overview of some of the history of what is probably the most well-known of all mathematical theorems. The first half of the title is a Gilbert and Sullivan quote!</p>



<p>Sketch No. 13&nbsp;<em>A Marvellous Proof</em>:&nbsp;<em>Fermat’s Last Theorem</em>&nbsp;Once again a reasonably synopsis of the history of another possible candidate for the most well-known of all mathematical theorems.</p>



<p>Sketch No. 14&nbsp;<em>On Beauty Bare</em>:&nbsp;<em>Euclid’s Plane Geometry</em>&nbsp;Another reasonably synopsis of the world’s most famous and biggest selling maths textbook.</p>



<p>Sketch No. 15&nbsp;<em>In Perfect Shape</em>:&nbsp;<em>The Platonic Solids</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;A brief, compact and largely accurate introduction to the history of the Platonic regular solids and the Archimedean semi-regular solids. I would have wished for more detail on the Renaissance rediscovery of the Archimedean solids, which was actually carried out by artists rather than mathematicians, a fact that our authors seem not to be aware of, as part of the explorations into the then new linear perspective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sketch No. 16 Shapes by the&nbsp;<em>Numbers</em>:&nbsp;<em>Coordinate Geometry</em>&nbsp;Another good synopsis covering both Fermat and Descartes and includes the important fact that the Cartesian system was actually popularised by the expanded Latin edition of&nbsp;<em>La Géométrie</em>&nbsp;put together by Frans van Schooten jr. Although our authors miss the junior. Having acknowledge his contribution they then miss one of his biggest contributions. Our authors write:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The two-axis rectangular coordinate system that we commonly attribute to Descarte seems instead to have evolved gradually during the century and a half after he published&nbsp;<em>La Géométrie</em>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Rectangular Cartesian coordinates were introduced by Frans van Schooten jr. in his Latin edition.</p>



<p>Sketch No. 17&nbsp;<em>Impossible, Imaginary, Useful</em>:&nbsp;<em>Complex Numbers</em>&nbsp;Having, in their discussion of cubic equations, failed to acknowledge the fact that Cardano actually showed how to eliminate conjugate pairs of complex numbers in his&nbsp;<em>Ars Magna</em>, even if doing so offended his feelings for mathematics, our authors now bring the relevant quote to this effect. Having opened with Cardano we then move onto Bombelli’s acceptance and Descartes’ rejection before our authors attribute an implicit anticipation of Euler’s Formula in the work of Abraham De Moivre, whilst ignoring the explicit formulation in the work of Roger Cotes. Dealing comparatively extensively with Euler our authors then move onto Argand and Gauss and the geometrical representation of complex numbers, whilst completely ignoring Casper Wessel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sketch No. 18&nbsp;<em>Half is Better</em>:&nbsp;<em>Sine and Cosine</em>&nbsp;We now get introduced to the history of trigonometry. Once again a reasonable short presentation of the main points of the history down to the seventeenth century, with an all too brief comment about the development of the trigonometrical ratios as functions.</p>



<p>Sketch No. 19&nbsp;<em>Strange New Worlds</em>:&nbsp;<em>The Non-Euclidian Geometries</em>&nbsp;Once again nothing here to criticise.</p>



<p>Sketch No. 20&nbsp;<em>In the Eye of the Beholder</em>:&nbsp;<em>Projective Geometry</em>&nbsp;Starts with some brief comments about the discovery of linear perspective during the Renaissance, then moves on to the development of projective geometry out of that and ends with Pascal’s Theorem. Once again no complaints on my part.</p>



<p>Sketch No. 21&nbsp;<em>What’s in a Game?</em>:&nbsp;<em>The Start of Probability Theory</em>&nbsp;Having had the teenage Pascal on conics we now have the mature Pascal on divvying up the stakes in an interrupted game of chance. This is followed by&nbsp;&nbsp;standard story of the evolution of probability theory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sketch No. 22&nbsp;<em>Making Sense of Data</em>:&nbsp;<em>Statistics Becomes a Science</em>&nbsp;Once again presents a standard account without any significant errors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sketch No. 23&nbsp;<em>Machines that Think?</em>:&nbsp;<em>Electronic Computers</em>&nbsp;Having presented twenty-two sketches with only occasional historical error, our authors now come completely of the rails: To start:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Some would say that the story begins 5000 years ago with the abacus, a calculating device of beads and rods that is still used today.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Greek term abacus refers to a counting board. The calculating device of beads and rods, which is also referred to as an abacus, was developed in Asia and didn’t become known in Europe until the end of the seventeenth beginning of the eighteenth centuries, via Russia, well after the counting board had ceased to be used in Europe.</p>



<p>We get no mention of the astrolabe, which is universally described as an analogue computer,</p>



<p>We then get Napier’s Bones and Oughtred’s slide rule as calculating devices implying that they are somehow related. They aren’t the slide rule is based on logarithms and although Napier invented logarithms his Bones aren’t.</p>



<p>Next up is the&nbsp;<em>Pascaline</em>&nbsp;with, quotes correctly the information that they were difficult to manufacture and so were a flop, although they don’t put it that bluntly. No mention of Wilhelm Schickard, whose calculator was earlier that the&nbsp;<em>Pascaline</em>. Of course, if we have Pascal’s calculator then we must have Leibniz’s, and we get the following hammer statement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Leibniz’s machine, the&nbsp;<em>Stepped Reckoner</em>, represented a major theoretical advance over the Pascaline in that&nbsp;<strong>its calculations were done in binary (base-two) arithmetic&nbsp;</strong>(my emphasis), the basis of all modern computer architecture.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When I read that I had a genuine what the fuck moment. There are three possibilities, either our authors are using a truly crappy source on the history of reckoning machines, or they are simply making shit up, or they created a truly bad syllogistic&nbsp;&nbsp;argument.</p>



<p>1) Leibniz was one of the first European mathematicians to develop binary arithmetic</p>



<p>2) Leibniz created a reckoning machine</p>



<p>Therefore: Leibniz’s reckoning machine must have used binary arithmetic</p>



<p>Of course, the conclusion does not follow from the premises and Leibniz’s&nbsp;<em>Stepped Reckoner</em>&nbsp;used decimal not binary numbers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A fourth possibility is a truly cataclysmic typo but our authors repeat the claim at the beginning of the next sketch of that is definitively not the case.</p>



<p>We get a brief respite with the description of a successful stepped reckoner in the nineteenth century, then we move onto Charles Babbage and a total train wreck. Our authors tell us:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Early in the 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century, Cambridge mathematics professor Charles Babbage began work on a machine for generating accurate logarithmic and astronomical tables.</p>



<p>[…]</p>



<p>By 1822, Babbage was literally cranking out tables with six-figure accuracy on a small machine he called a&nbsp;<em>Difference Engine</em>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I think our authors live in an alternative universe, only this could explain how Babbage was “cranking out tables with six-figure accuracy” on a machine that was never built! They appear to be confusing the small working model he produced to demonstrate the principles on which the engine was to function with the full engine which was never constructed. They even include a picture of that small working model labelled, Babbage’s Difference Engine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1832, Babbage and Joseph Clement&nbsp;produced a small working model (one-seventh of the plan),&nbsp;&nbsp;which operated on 6-digit numbers by second-order differences. Lady Byron described seeing the working prototype in 1833: “We both went to see the thinking machine (or so it seems) last Monday. It raised several Nos. to the 2nd and 3rd powers, and extracted the root of a Quadratic equation.”&nbsp;Work on the larger engine was suspended in 1833. (Wikipedia)</p>
</blockquote>



<p>1822 was the date that Babbage began work on the Difference Engine.&nbsp;&nbsp;As to being small:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This first difference engine would have been composed of around 25,000 parts, weighed fifteen short tons&nbsp;(13,600&nbsp;kg), and would have been 8&nbsp;ft (2.4&nbsp;m) tall. (Wikipedia)</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Not exactly a desktop computer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our authors continue with the ahistorical fantasies:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In 1801, Joseph-Marie Jacquard had designed a loom that wove complex patterns guided by a series of cards with holes punched in them. Its success in turning out “pre-programmed” patterns led Babbage to try to make a calculating machine that would accept instructions and data from punch cards.&nbsp;&nbsp;He called the proposed device an&nbsp;<em>Analytical Engine</em>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In 1801 Jacquard exhibited an earlier loom at the&nbsp;Exposition des produits de l’industrie française&nbsp;and was awarded a bronze medal. He started developing the punch card loom in 1804. The claim about Babbage is truly putting the cart before the horse. Following the death of his wife in 1827, Babbage undertook an extended journey throughout continental Europe, studying and researching&nbsp;all sorts of industrial plant to study and analyse their uses of mechanisation and automation. Something he had already done in the 1820s in Britain. He published the results of this research in his&nbsp;<em>On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures</em>&nbsp;in 1832. To quote myself, “It would be safe to say that in 1832 Babbage knew more about mechanisation and automation that almost anybody else on the entire planet and what it was capable of doing and which activities could be mechanised and/or automated. It was in this situation that Babbage decided to transfer his main interest from the Difference Engine to developing the concept of the Analytical Engine conceived from the very beginning as a general-purpose computer capable of carrying out everything that could be accomplished by such a machine, far more than just a super number cruncher.” The Jacquard loom was just one of the machines he had studied on his odyssey and he incorporated its concept of punch card programming into the plans for his new computer.</p>



<p>Of course, our authors can’t resit repeating the Ada Lovelace myths and hagiography:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Babbage’s assistant in this undertaking was Augusta Ada Lovelace […] Lovelace translated, clarified and extended a French description of Babbage’s project, adding a large amount of original commentary. She expanded on the idea of “programming” the machine with punched-card instructions and wrote what is considered to be the first significant computer program…</p>

<p>Ada was in no way ever Babbage’s assistant. The notes added to the&nbsp;French description of Babbage’s project were cowritten with Babbage. They did not expand on the idea of “programming” the machine with punched-card instructions. The computer program included in Note G was written by Babbage and not Lovelace and wasn’t the first significant computer program. Babbage had already written several before the Lovelace translation.</p>

<p>We now turn to George Boole and the advent of Boolean algebraic logic, which is dealt with extremely briefly but contains the following rather strange comment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Although Boole reportedly thought his system would never have any practical applications…</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I spent several years at university researching the life and work of George Boole and never came across any such claim. In fact, Boole himself applied his logical algebra to probability theory in&nbsp;<em>Laws of Thought</em>, as is stated quite clearly in its full title&nbsp;<em>An Investigation of the Laws of Thought: on Which are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities</em>.</p>



<p>After a very brief account of Herman Hollerith’s use of punch cards to accelerate the counting of 1880 US census, we take a big leap to Claude Shannon.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The pieces started to come together in 1937, when Claude Shannon, in his master’s thesis at M.I.T., combined Boolean algebra with electrical relays and switching circuits to show how machines can “do” mathematical logic.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We get no mention of the fact that Shannon was working on the circuitry of Vannevar Bush’s Differential Analyser, an analogue computer. The Differential Analyser played a highly significant role in the history of the computer as all three, US, war time computers, the ABC, the Harvard Mark I, and the ENIAC, all mentioned by our authors,&nbsp;&nbsp;were all projects set in motion to create an improved version of the Differential Analyser.</p>



<p>We move onto WWII:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Alan Turing, the mathematician who spearheaded the successful British attempt to break the German U-boat command’s so-called “Enigma code,” designed several electronic machines to help in the crypto analysis.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Turing designed one machine the Bombe based on the existing Polish Bomba, his design was improved by Gordon Welchman and the machine was actually designed and constructed by Harold Keen. We get a brief not totally accurate account of Max Newman, Tommy Flowers and the Colossus, before moving to Germany and Konrad Zuse. Our authors tell us:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile in Germany, Konrad Zuse had also built a programmable electronic computer. His work begun in the late 1930s, resulted in a functioning electro-mechanical machine by sometime in the early 1940s, giving him some historical claim to the title of inventory of electronic computers.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This contains a central contradiction an electro-mechanical computer is not an electronic computer. Also, we have a precise time line for the development of Zuse’s computers. His Z1, a purely mechanical computer was finished in 1938, his Z2, an electro-mechanical computer in 1939. The Z3, which our authors are talking about, another electro-mechanical computer, an improvement on the Z2, was finished in 1941. Our authors erroneously claimed that Leibniz’s steeped reckoner used binary arithmetic but didn’t think it necessary to point out that Zuse was the first to use binary rather than decimal in his computers beginning with the Z1. They also state:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>However, wartime secrecy kept his work hidden as well.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Zuse already set up his computer company during the war and went straight into development and production after the war. Although he couldn’t complete construction of his Z4, begun in 1944, until 1949, delivering the finished product to the ETH in Zurich in 1950.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Z4</strong>&nbsp;was arguably the world’s first commercial&nbsp;digital computer, and is the oldest surviving programmable computer. (Wikipedia).</p>



<p>Our authors now deliver surprisingly brief accounts of the ABC, the Harvard Mark I, and ENIAC, before delivering the John von Neumann myth.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>John von Neuman is generally credited with devising a way to store programs inside a computer.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The stored program computer in question is the EDVAC devised by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert, the inventors of ENIAC. Von Neuman merely described their design, without attribution, in his&nbsp;<em>First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC</em>, thereby stealing the credit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The sketch ends with a very rapid gallop through the first stored program computers, EDSAC in Britain and UNIVAC I in the US, the introduction of first transistors and then integrated circuitry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is so much good, detailed history of the development of computers that I simply don’t understand how our authors could get so much wrong.</p>



<p>Sketch No. 24&nbsp;<em>The Arithmetic of Reasoning</em>:&nbsp;<em>Boolean Algebra</em>&nbsp;A brief nod to Aristotelian logic and then the repeat of the false claim that Leibniz’s steeped reckoner used binary numbers leads us into Leibniz’s attempts to create a calculus of logic, which however our authors admit remained unpublished and unknown until the twentieth century. All of this is merely a lead in to Augustus De Morgan and George Boole. We get brief, pathetic biographies of both of them emphasising their struggles in life. This leads into a presentation of Boole’s logic, presented in the form of truth tables which didn’t exist till much later! We then get an extraordinary ahistorical statement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>De Morgan, too, was an influential, persuasive proponent of the algebraic treatment of logic. His publications helped to refine, extend, and popularise the system started by Boole.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>De Morgan was an outspoken supporter of Boole’s work but , his publications did not help to refine, extend, and popularise the system started by Boole. We do however get De Morgan’s Laws and his logic of relations. The latter gives our authors the chance to wax lyrical about Charles Saunders Pierce.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Towards the end of this very short sketch, we get the following, “But it was the work of Boole, De Morgan, C. S. Pierce&nbsp;<strong>and others…”&nbsp;</strong>(my emphasis) That “and others” covers a multitude of omissions, probably the most important being the work of William Stanley Jevons (1835–1882). An oft repeated truisms is that Boole’s algebraic logic is not Boolean algebra! It was first Jevons, who modifying Boole system turned it into the Boolean algebra used by computers today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sketch No. 25&nbsp;<em>Beyond Counting</em>:&nbsp;<em>Infinity and the Theory of Sets</em>&nbsp;Enter stage right George Cantor. We get a reasonable introduction to Cantorian set theory, Kronecker’s objections and the problem of set theory paradoxes. We then get a long digression on nineteenth century neo-Thomism, metaphysics, infinite sets and the Mind of God. Sorry but this has no place in a very short, supposedly elementary introduction to the history of mathematics, “designed for students just beginning their study of the discipline.”</p>



<p>Sketch No. 26&nbsp;<em>Out of the Shadows</em>:&nbsp;<em>The Tangent Function</em>&nbsp;is a reasonable account of the gradual inclusion of the tangent function into the trigonometrical canon. My only criticism is although they correctly state that Regiomontanus introduced the tangent function in his&nbsp;<em>Tabulae directionum profectionumque</em>&nbsp;written in 1467. Our authors only give the first two words of the title and translate it as&nbsp;<em>Table of Directions</em>. This is not incorrect but left so probably leads to misconceptions. Directions here does not refer to finding ones way geographical but to a method used in astrology to determine from a birth horoscope the major events, including death, in the subject life. This require complex spherical trigonometrical calculation transferring points from one system of celestial coordinates to another system. Hence the need for tangents.</p>



<p>Sketch No. 27&nbsp;<em>Counting Ratios</em>:&nbsp;<em>Logarithms</em>&nbsp;A detailed introduction to the history of the invention of logarithms. In general, OK but a bit off the rails on the story of Jost Bürgi.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As Napier and Briggs worked in Scotland, the Thirty Years’ War was spreading misery on the European continent. One of its side effects was the loss of most copies of a 1620 publication by Joost Bürgi, a Swiss clockmaker. Bürgi had discovered the basic principles of logarithms while assisting the astronomer Johannes Kepler in Prague in 1588, some years before Napier, but his book of tables was not published until six years after Napier’s&nbsp;<em>Descriptio</em>&nbsp;appeared. When most of the copies disappeared, Bürgi’s work faded into obscurity.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The failure of Bürgi’s work to make an impact almost certainly had to do with the facts that only a very small number were ever printed and it only consisted of a table of what we now call anti-logarithms with no explanation of how they were created or how to use them.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, in 1588 Kepler was still living and working in Graz and Bürgi was living and working in Kassel. Kepler first moved to Prague in 1600 and Bürgi in 1604. The reference to 1588 in Bürgi’s work is almost certainly to&nbsp;prosthaphaeresis, a method of using trigonometrical formulars to turn difficult multiplications and divisions into addition and subtractions which Bürgi had learnt from Paul Wittich, and not to logarithms. His work on logarithms almost certainly started later than that of Napier but was independent. Interestingly it is thought that Napier was led to logarithms after being taught&nbsp;&nbsp;prosthaphaeresis by John Craig, who had also learnt it from Wittich</p>



<p>Sketch No. 28&nbsp;<em>Anyway You Slice It</em>:&nbsp;<em>Conic Sections</em>&nbsp;What is actually quite a good section on the history of conic sections is spoilt by one minor error and a cluster fuck concerning Kepler. The small error concerns Witelo (c.1230–after 1280), our authors write:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There is some evidence that Apollonius’s&nbsp;<em>Conics</em>&nbsp;was known in Europe as far back as the 113<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century, when Erazmus Witelo used conics in his book on optics and perspective.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Witelo’s book is titled&nbsp;<em>De Perspectiva</em>&nbsp;and is purely a book on optics not perspective. Perspectivist optics is a school of optical theory derived from the optics of Ibn al-Haytham, whose book&nbsp;<em>Kitāb al-Manāẓir</em>&nbsp;is titled&nbsp;<em>De Perspectiva</em>&nbsp;in Latin translation. On to Kepler:</p>

<p>Sorry about the scans but I couldn’t be arsed to type out the whole section.</p>



<p>The camera obscura that Kepler assembled on the market place in Graz in the summer of 1600 was a small tent and not “a large wooden structure.” It was a pin hole camera and not a kind of large-size one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pin hole camera problem, the image created is larger than it should be, had been known since the Middle Ages, was widely discussed in the literature, and Kepler had been expecting it before he began his observations.&nbsp;&nbsp;His attention had been drawn to the problem by Tycho when he was in Prague at the beginning of 1600 to negotiate his move there to work with Tycho. Tycho had also drawn his attention to the problem of atmospheric refraction in the astronomy. These were the triggers that motivated his studies in optics. As noted he moved to Prague to work with Tycho but there was no Imperial Observatory in Prague.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kepler inherited Tycho’s position of Imperial Mathematicus but not his observation, which were inherited by his daughter. This led to several years of difficult negotiations before he obtained permission to publish his work based on those observations. Tycho had set Kepler on the problem of calculating the orbit of Mars, the work that led to his first two planetary laws, before his death.</p>



<p>The book that Kepler used for his optical studies and on which he based his own work was Friedrich Risner’s&nbsp;“<em>Opticae thesaurus: Alhazeni Arabis libri septem, nuncprimum editi; Eiusdem liber De Crepusculis et nubium ascensionibus, Item Vitellonis Thuringopoloni libri X</em>” (Optical Treasure: Seven books of Alhazen the Arab, published for the first time; His book On Twilight and the Rising of Clouds, Also of Vitello Thuringopoloni book X), which was published in 1572.</p>



<p>“Of course he thought of the conic sections!” Actually, when Kepler first realised that the orbit of Mars was some sort of oval, he didn’t think of the conic section at all. Something for which he criticised himself in his&nbsp;<em>Astronomia Nova,</em>&nbsp;when he finally realised, after much more wasted effort, that the orbit was actually an ellipse. A realisation not based on more measurements. The&nbsp;<em>Astronomia Nova</em>&nbsp;from 1609 only contains the first two planetary laws. The third was first published in his&nbsp;<em>Harmonice Mundi</em>&nbsp;in 1619.</p>



<p><em>&nbsp;</em>Sketch No. 29&nbsp;<em>Beyond the Pale</em>:&nbsp;<em>Irrational Numbers</em>&nbsp;Once again an acceptable historical account.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sketch No. 30&nbsp;<em>Barely Touching</em>:&nbsp;<em>From Tangents to Derivatives</em>&nbsp;Not perfect but more than reasonable</p>



<p>The book ends with a&nbsp;<em>What to Read Next</em>&nbsp;which begins with&nbsp;<em>The Reference Shelf</em>. Here they recommend several one volume histories of mathematics starting with Victor J Katz and then moving onto Howard Eves’s&nbsp;<em>An Introduction to the History of Mathematics&nbsp;</em>and David M . Burton’s&nbsp;<em>The History of Mathematics</em>&nbsp;which they admit are both showing their age. They move on to lot more recommendations but studiously ignore, what was certainly the market leader before Katz,&nbsp;Carl B. Boyer,&nbsp;<em>A History of</em>&nbsp;<em>Mathematics</em>&nbsp;in the third edition edited by Uta Merzbach. I seriously wonder what they have against Boyer whose books on the history of mathematics are excellent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having covered a fairly wide range of reference books, including a lot of Grattan-Guinness we now move onto&nbsp;<em>Twelve Historical Books You Ought to Read</em>. Of course, any such recommendation is subjective but some of their choices are more that questionable. They start, for example, with Tobias Dantzig’s&nbsp;<em>Number the Language of Science</em>. This was first published in 1930 and is definitively severely dated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our authors also recommend Reviel Netz &amp; William Noel,&nbsp;<em>The Archimedes Codex</em>&nbsp;(2007). This book was the object of an incredible media hype when it first appeared. Whilst the imaging techniques used to expose the Archimedean manuscript on the palimpsest are truly fascinating the claims made by the authors about the newly won knowledge about Archimedes works are extremely hyperbolic and contain more than a little bullshit. Should this really be on a list of twelve history of maths books one ought to read?</p>



<p>I did a double take when I saw that they recommend Eric Templer&nbsp;<em>Bell’s Men of</em>&nbsp;<em>Mathematics</em>. They themselves say:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The book has lost some of its original popularity, not (or at least not primarily) because of its politically incorrect, but rather because Bell takes too many liberties with his sources. (Some critics would say “because he makes things up.”) The book is fun to read, but don’t rely solely on Bell for facts.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>My take don’t waste your time reading this crap book. I read it when I was sixteen and spent at least twenty years unlearning all the straight forward lies that Bell spews out!</p>



<p>Another disaster recommendation is Dava Sobel’s&nbsp;<em>Longitude</em>, which our authors say, “provides a good picture of the interactions among mathematics, astronomy, and navigation in the 18<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century.” Sobel’s much hyped book give an extremely distorted “picture of the interactions among mathematics, astronomy, and navigation in the 18<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century,” which at times is closer to a fantasy novel than a serios history book. If you really want to learn the true facts about&nbsp;&nbsp;those interactions then read Richard Dunn &amp; Rebekah Higgitt,&nbsp;<em>Finding Longitude</em>:&nbsp;<em>How ships, clocks and stars helped solve the longitude problem</em>&nbsp;(Collins, 2014) and Katy Barrett,&nbsp;<em>Looking for Longitude</em>:&nbsp;<em>A Cultural</em>&nbsp;<em>History</em>&nbsp;(Liverpool University Press), <a href="https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2023/09/20/she-sought-it-here-she-sought-it-there-she-found-elusive-longitude-everywhere/"><strong>both volumes are written by professional historians, who spent several years researching the topic in a major research project.&nbsp;</strong></a></p>



<p>The section closes with&nbsp;<em>History Online</em>, which can’t be any good because it doesn’t include The Renaissance Mathematicus!&nbsp;🙃</p>



<p>The apparatus begins with a useful&nbsp;<em>When They Lived</em>, which simply lists lots of the most well-known mathematicians alphabetically with their birth and death dates. This is followed by the bibliography, already mentioned above, and a good index. There are numerous, small, black and white illustration scattered throughout the pages.</p>



<p>Despite my negative comment about some points in the book, I would actually recommend it as a reasonably priced, mostly accurate, introduction to the history of mathematics. A small criticism is it does at times display a US American bias, but it was written primarily for American students. A good jumping off point for somebody developing an interest in the discipline. In any case considerably better that my jumping off point, E. T. Bell!</p>

attached NVMe drives to run your cloud database, as opposed to the slower and less consistent network-attached storage used by most cloud database providers.<!-- --> <!-- -->This results in a blazing fast queries, low latency, and unlimited IOPS.<!-- --> <!-- -->Check out <a href="https://planetscale.com/docs/metal">the docs</a> to learn more.</p><h2 id="tape-storage"><a href="#tape-storage">Tape Storage</a></h2><p>As early as the 1950s, computers were using <strong>tape drives</strong> for non-volatile digital storage.<!-- --> <!-- -->Tape storage systems have been produced in many form factors over the years, ranging from ones that take up an entire room to small drives that can fit in your pocket, such as the iconic Sony Walkman.<!-- --> <!-- -->A tape <strong>Reader</strong> is a box containing hardware specifically designed for reading <strong>tape cartridges</strong>.<!-- --> <!-- -->Tape cartridges are inserted and then unwound which causes the tape to move over the <strong>IO Head</strong>, which can <span>read</span> and <span>write</span> data.</p><p>Though tape started being used to store digital information over 70 years ago, it is still in use today for certain applications.<!-- --> <!-- -->A standard LTO tape cartridge has several-hundred meters of 0.5 inch wide tape.<!-- --> <!-- -->The tape has several tracks running along its length, each track being further divided up into many small cells.<!-- --> <!-- -->A single tape cartridge contains many trillions of cells.</p><p>Each cell can have its magnetic polarization set to up or down, corresponding to a binary 0 or 1.<!-- --> <!-- -->Technically, the magnetic field created by the <em>transition</em> between two cells is what makes the 1 or zero.<!-- --> <!-- -->A long sequence of bits on a tape forms a page of data.<!-- --> <!-- -->In the visualization of the tape reader, we simplify this by showing the tape as a simple sequence of data pages, rather than showing individual bits.</p><p>When a tape needs to be read, it is loaded into a reader, sometimes by hand and sometimes by robot.<!-- --> <!-- -->The reader then spins the cartridge with its motor and uses the <strong>reader head</strong> to read off the binary values as the tape passes underneath.</p><p>Give this a try with the (greatly slowed down) interactive visualization below.<!-- --> <!-- -->You can control the <span>speed of the tape</span> if you'd like it faster or slower.<!-- --> <!-- -->You can also <span>issue read requests</span> and <span>write requests</span> and then monitor how long these take.<!-- --> <!-- -->You'll also be able to see the queue of pending IO operations pop up in the top-left corner.<!-- --> <!-- -->Try issuing a few requests to get a feel for how tape storage works:</p><p>If you spend enough time with this, you will notice that:</p><ol><li>If you read/write to a cell "near" the read head, it's fast.</li><li>If you read/write to a cell "far" from the read head, it's slow.</li></ol><p>Even with modern tape systems, reading data that is far away on a tape can take 10s of seconds, because it may need to spin the tape by hundreds of meters to reach the desired data.<!-- --> <!-- -->Let's compare two more specific, interactive examples to illustrate this further.</p><p>Say we need to <span>read</span> a total of 4 pages and <span>write</span> an additional 4 pages worth of data.<!-- --> <!-- -->In the first scenario, all 4 pages we need to read are in a neat sequence, and the 4 to write to are immediately after the reads.<!-- --> <!-- -->You can see the IO operations queued up in the white container on the top-left.<!-- --> <!-- -->Go ahead and click the <span>Time IO button</span> to see this in action, and observe the time it takes to complete.</p><p>As you can see, it takes somewhere around 3-4 seconds.<!-- --> <!-- -->On a real system, with an IO head that can operate much faster and motors that can drive the spools more quickly, it would be much faster.</p><p>Now consider another scenario where we need to read and write the same number of pages.<!-- --> <!-- -->However, these reads and writes are spread out throughout the tape.<!-- --> <!-- -->Go ahead and click the <span>Time IO button</span> again.</p><p>That took ~7x longer for the same total number of reads and writes!<!-- --> <!-- -->Imagine if this system was being used to load your social media feed or your email inbox.<!-- --> <!-- -->It might take 10s of seconds or even a full minute to display.<!-- --> <!-- -->This would be totally unacceptable.</p><p>Though the latency for random reads and writes is poor, tape systems operate quite well when reading or writing data in long sequences.<!-- --> <!-- -->In fact, tape storage still has many such use cases today in the modern tech world.<!-- --> <!-- -->Tape is particularly well-suited for situations where there is a need for <em>massive</em> amounts of storage that does not need to be read frequently, but needs to be safely stored.<!-- --> <!-- -->This is because tape is both cheaper per-gigabyte and has a longer shelf-life than its competition: solid state drives and hard disk drives.<!-- --> <!-- -->For example, CERN has a tape storage data warehouse with <a href="https://home.cern/science/computing/data-preservation">over 400 petabytes of data</a> under management.<!-- --> <!-- -->AWS also offers <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/vtl/">tape archiving</a> as a service.</p><p>What tape is not well suited for is high-traffic transactional databases.<!-- --> <!-- -->For these and many other high-performance tasks, other storage mediums are needed.</p><h2 id="hard-disk-drives"><a href="#hard-disk-drives">Hard Disk Drives</a></h2><p>The next major breakthrough in storage technology was the <strong>hard disk drive</strong>.</p><p>Instead of storing binary data on a tape, we store them on a small circular metal disk known as the <strong>Platter</strong>.<!-- --> <!-- -->This disk is placed inside of an <strong>enclosure</strong> with a special <strong>read/write head</strong>, and spins very fast (7200 RPM is common, for example).<!-- --> <!-- -->Like the tape, this disk is also divided into tracks.<!-- --> <!-- -->However, the tracks are <em>circular</em>, and a single disk will often have well over 100,000 tracks.<!-- --> <!-- -->Each track contains hundreds of thousands of pages, and each page containing 4k (or so) of data.</p><p>An HDD requires a mechanical spinning motion of both the reader and the platter to bring the data to the correct location for reading.<!-- --> <!-- -->One advantage of HDD over tape is that the entire surface area of the bits is available 100% of the time.<!-- --> <!-- -->It still takes time to move the needle + spin the disk to the correct location for a read or write, but it does not need to be "uncovered" like it needs to be for a tape.<!-- --> <!-- -->This combined with the fact that there are two different things that can spin, means data can be read and written with much lower latency.<!-- --> <!-- -->A typical random read can be performed in 1-3 milliseconds.</p><p>Below is an interactive hard drive.<!-- --> <!-- -->You can control the <span>speed of the platter</span> if you'd like it faster or slower.<!-- --> <!-- -->You can request that the hard drive <span>read a page</span> and <span>write to a nearby available page</span>.<!-- --> <!-- -->If you request a read or write before the previous one is complete, a queue will be built up, and the disk will process the requests in the order it receives them.<!-- --> <!-- -->As before, you'll also be able to see the queue of pending IO operations in the white IO queue box.</p><p>As with the tape, the speed of the platter spin has been slowed down by orders of magnitude to make it easier to see what's going on.<!-- --> <!-- -->In real disks, there would also be many more tracks and sectors, enough to store multiple terabytes of data in some cases.</p><p>Let's again consider a few specific scenarios to see how the order of reads and writes affects latency.</p><p>Say we need to write a total of three pages of data and then read 3 pages afterward.<!-- --> <!-- -->The three writes will happen on nearby available pages, and the reads will be from tracks 1, 4, and 3.<!-- --> <!-- -->Go ahead and click the <span>Time IO button</span>.<!-- --> <!-- -->You'll see the requests hit the queue, the reads and writes get fulfilled, and then the total time at the end.</p><p>Due to the sequential nature of most of these operations, all the tasks were able to complete quickly.</p><p>Now consider the same set of 6 reads and writes, but with them being interleaved in a different order.<!-- --> <!-- -->Go ahead and click the <span>Time IO button</span> again.</p><p>If you had the patience to wait until the end, you should notice how the same total number of reads and writes took much longer.<!-- --> <!-- -->A lot of time was spent waiting for the platter to spin into the correct place under the read head.</p><p>Magnetic disks have supported command queueing directly on the disks for a long time (80s with SCSI, 2000s with SATA).<!-- --> <!-- -->Because of this, the OS can issue multiple commands that run in parallel and potentially out-of-order, similar to SSDs.<!-- --> <!-- -->Magnetic disks also improve their performance if they can build up a queue of operations that the disk controller can then schedule reads and writes to optimize for the geometry of the disk.</p><p>Here's a visualization to help us see the difference between the latency of a <span>random tape read</span> compared to a <span>random disk read</span>.<!-- --> <!-- -->A random tape read will often take multiple seconds (I put 1 second here to be generous) and a disk head seek takes closer to 2 milliseconds (one thousandth of a second)</p><p>Even though HDDs are an improvement over tape, they are still "slow" in some scenarios, especially random reads and writes.<!-- --> <!-- -->The next big breakthrough, and currently the most common storage format for transactional databases, are SSDs.</p><h2 id="solid-state-drives"><a href="#solid-state-drives">Solid State Drives</a></h2><p>Solid State Storage, or "flash" storage, was invented in the 1980s.<!-- --> <!-- -->It was around even while tape and hard disk drives dominated the commercial and consumer storage spaces.<!-- --> <!-- -->It didn't become mainstream for consumer storage until the 2000s due to technological limitations and cost.</p><p>The advantage of SSDs over both tape and disk is that they do not rely on any <em>mechanical</em> components to read data.<!-- --> <!-- -->All data is read, written, and erased electronically using a special type of non-volatile <em>transistor</em> known as NAND flash.<!-- --> <!-- -->This means that each 1 or 0 can be read or written without the need to move any physical components, but 100% through electrical signaling.</p><p>SSDs are organized into one or more <strong>targets</strong>, each of which contains many <strong>blocks</strong> which each contain some number of <strong>pages</strong>.<!-- --> <!-- -->SSDs read and write data at the page level, meaning they can only read or write full pages at a time.<!-- --> <!-- -->In the SSD below, you can see reads and writes happening via the <strong>lines</strong> between the controller and targets (also called "traces").</p><p>The removal of mechanical components reduces the latency between when a request is made and when the drive can fulfill the request.<!-- --> <!-- -->There is no more waiting around for something to spin.</p><p>We're showing small examples in the visual to make it easier to follow along, but a single SSD is capable of storing multiple terabytes of data.<!-- --> <!-- -->For example, say each page holds 4096 bits of data (4k).<!-- --> <!-- -->Now, say each block stores 16k pages, each target stores 16k blocks, and our device has 8 targets.<!-- --> <!-- -->This comes out to <code>4k * 16k * 16k * 8 = 8,796,093,022,208</code> bits, or 8 terabytes.<!-- --> <!-- -->We could increase the capacity of this drive by adding more targets or packing more pages in per block.</p><p>Here's a visualization to help us see the difference between the latency of a random read on an <span>HDD</span> vs <span>SSD</span>.<!-- --> <!-- -->A random read on an SSD varies by model, but can execute as fast as 16μs (μs = microsecond, which is one millionth of a second).</p><p>It would be tempting to think that with the removal of mechanical parts, the organization of data on an SSD no longer matters.<!-- --> <!-- -->Since we don't have to wait for things to spin, we can access any data at any location with perfect speed, right?</p><p>Not quite.</p><p>There are other factors that impact the performance of IO operations on an SSD.<!-- --> <!-- -->We won't cover them all here, but two that we will discuss are <strong>parallelism</strong> and <strong>garbage collection</strong>.</p><h3 id="ssd-parallelism"><a href="#ssd-parallelism">SSD Parallelism</a></h3><p>Typically, each <strong>target</strong> has a dedicated <strong>line</strong> going from the control unit to the target.<!-- --> <!-- -->This line is what processes reads and writes, and only one page can be communicated by each line at a time.<!-- --> <!-- -->Pages can be communicated on these lines <em>really fast</em>, but it still does take a small slice of time.<!-- --> <!-- -->The organization of data and sequence of reads and writes has a significant impact on how efficiently these lines can be used.</p><p>In the interactive SSD below, we have 4 targets and a set of 8 write operations queued up.<!-- --> <!-- -->You can click the <span>Time IO button</span> to see what happens when we can use the lines in parallel to get these pages written.</p><p>In this case, we wrote 8 pages spread across the 4 targets.<!-- --> <!-- -->Because they were spread out, we were able to leverage parallelism to write 4 at a time in two time slices.</p><p>Compare that with another sequence where the SSD writes all 8 pages to the same target.<!-- --> <!-- -->The SSD can only utilize a single data line for the writes.<!-- --> <!-- -->Again, hit the <span>Time IO button</span> to see the timing.</p><p>Notice how only one line was used and it needed to write sequentially.<!-- --> <!-- -->All the other lines sat dormant.</p><p>This demonstrates that the order in which we read and write data matters for performance.<!-- --> <!-- -->Many software engineers don't have to think about this on a day-to-day basis, but those designing software like MySQL need to pay careful attention to what <a href="https://planetscale.com/blog/btrees-and-database-indexes">structures data is being stored in</a> and how data is laid out on disk.</p><h3 id="ssd-garbage-collection"><a href="#ssd-garbage-collection">SSD Garbage Collection</a></h3><p>The minimum "chunk" of data that can be read from or written to an SSD is the size of a page.<!-- --> <!-- -->Even if you only need a subset of the data within, that is the unit that requests to the drive must be made in.</p><p>Data can be read from a page any number of times.<!-- --> <!-- -->However, writes are a bit different.<!-- --> <!-- -->After a page is written to, it cannot be overwritten with new data until the old data has been explicitly <strong>erased</strong>.<!-- --> <!-- -->The tricky part is, individual pages cannot be erased.<!-- --> <!-- -->When you need to erase data, the entire block must be erased, and afterwards all of the pages within it can be reused.</p><p>Each SSD needs to have an internal algorithm for managing which pages are empty, which are in use, and which are <strong>dirty</strong>.<!-- --> <!-- -->A <strong>dirty</strong> page is one that has been written to but the data is no longer needed and ready to be erased.<!-- --> <!-- -->Data also sometimes needs to be re-organized to allow for new write traffic.<!-- --> <!-- -->The algorithm that manages this is called the <strong>garbage collector</strong>.</p><p>Let's see how this can have an impact by looking at another visualization.<!-- --> <!-- -->In the below SSD, all four of the targets are storing data.<!-- --> <!-- -->Some of the data is <span>dirty, indicated by red text</span>.<!-- --> <!-- -->We want to <span>write</span> 5 pages worth of data to this SSD.<!-- --> <!-- -->If we <span>time this sequence of writes</span>, the SSD can happily write them to free pages with no need for extra garbage collection.<!-- --> <!-- -->There are sufficient unused pages in the first target.</p><p>Now say we have a drive with different data already on it, but we want to <span>write</span> those same 5 pages of data to it.<!-- --> <!-- -->In this drive, we only have 2 pages that are unused, but a number of <span>dirty pages</span>.<!-- --> <!-- -->In order to write 5 pages of data, the SSD will need to spend some time doing garbage collection to make room for the new data.<!-- --> <!-- -->When attempting to <span>time another sequence of writes</span>, some garbage collection will take place to make room for the data, slowing down the write.</p><p>In this case, the drive had to move the two non-dirty pages from the top-left target to new locations.<!-- --> <!-- -->By doing this, it was able to make all of the pages on the top-left target dirty, making it safe to erase that data.<!-- --> <!-- -->This made room for the 5 new pages of data to be written.<!-- --> <!-- -->These additional steps significantly slowed down the performance of the write.</p><p>This shows how the organization of data on the drive can have an impact on performance.<!-- --> <!-- -->When SSDs have a lot of reads, writes, and deletes, we can end up with SSDs that have degraded performance due to garbage collection.<!-- --> <!-- -->Though you may not be aware, busy SSDs do garbage collection tasks regularly, which can slow down other operations.</p><p>These are just two of many reasons why the arrangement of data on a SSD affects its performance.</p><h2 id="storage-in-the-cloud"><a href="#storage-in-the-cloud">Storage in the cloud</a></h2><p>The shift from tape, to disk, to solid state has allowed durable IO performance to accelerate dramatically over the past several decades.<!-- --> <!-- -->However, there is another phenomenon that has caused an additional shift in IO performance: moving to the cloud.</p><p>Though there were companies offering cloud compute services before this, the mass move to cloud gained significant traction when Amazon AWS launched in 2006.<!-- --> <!-- -->Since that time, tens of thousands of companies have moved their app servers and database systems to their cloud and other similar services from Google, Microsoft, and others.</p><p>Though there are many upsides to this trend, there are several downsides.<!-- --> <!-- -->One of these is that servers tend to have less permanence.<!-- --> <!-- -->Users rent (virtualised) servers on arbitrary hardware within gigantic data centers.<!-- --> <!-- -->These servers can get shut down at any time for a variety of reasons - hardware failure, hardware replacement, network disconnects, etc.<!-- --> <!-- -->When building platforms on rented cloud infrastructure, computer systems need to be able to tolerate more frequent failures at any moment.<!-- --> <!-- -->This, along with many engineers' desire for dynamically-scaleable storage volumes has led to a new sub-phenomenon: Separation of <strong>storage</strong> and <strong>compute</strong>.</p><h2 id="separating-storage-from-compute"><a href="#separating-storage-from-compute">Separating storage from compute</a></h2><p>Traditionally, most servers, desktops, laptops, phones and other computing devices have their non-volatile storage directly attached.<!-- --> <!-- -->These are attached with SATA cables, PCIe interfaces, or even built directly into the same SOC as the RAM, CPU, and other components.<!-- --> <!-- -->This is great for speed, but provides the following challenges:</p><ol><li>If the server goes down, the data goes down with it.</li><li>The storage is of a fixed size.</li></ol><p>For application servers, 1. and 2. are typically not a big deal since they work well in ephemeral environments by design.<!-- --> <!-- -->If one goes down, just spin up a new one.<!-- --> <!-- -->They also don't typically need much storage, as most of what they do happens in-memory.</p><p>Databases are a different story.<!-- --> <!-- -->If a server goes down, we don't want to lose our data, and data size grows quickly, meaning we may hit storage limits.<!-- --> <em>Partly</em> due to this, many cloud providers allow you to spin up compute instances with a separately-configurable storage system attached over the network.<!-- --> <!-- -->In other words, using network-attached storage as the default.</p><p>When you create a new server in EC2, the default is typically to attach an EBS network storage volume.<!-- --> <!-- -->Many database services including Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora, Google Cloud SQL, and PlanetScale rely on these types of storage systems that have compute separated from storage over the network.<!-- --> <!-- -->This provides a nice advantage in the that the storage volume can be dynamically resized as data grows and shrinks.<!-- --> <!-- -->It also means that if a server goes down, the data is still safe, and can be re-attached to a different server.<!-- --> <!-- -->This simplicity has come at a cost, however.</p><h2 id="local-vs-network-storage"><a href="#local-vs-network-storage">Local vs network storage</a></h2><p>Consider the following simple configuration.<!-- --> <!-- -->In it, we have a server with a CPU, RAM, and direct-attached NVMe SSD.<!-- --> <!-- -->NVMe SSDs are a type of solid state disk that use the non-volatile memory host controller interface specification for blazing-fast IO speed and great bandwidth.<!-- --> <!-- -->In such a setup, the <span>round trip from CPU to memory (RAM)</span> takes about 100 nanoseconds (a nanosecond is 1 billionth of a second).<!-- --> <span>A round trip from the CPU to a locally-attached NVMe SSD</span> takes about 50,000 nanoseconds (50 microseconds).</p><p>This makes it pretty clear that it's best to keep as much data in memory as possible for faster IO times.<!-- --> <!-- -->However, we still need disk because (A) memory is more expensive and (B) we need to store our data somewhere permanent.<!-- --> <!-- -->As slow as it may seem here, a locally-attached NVMe SSD is about as fast as it gets for modern storage.</p><p>Let's compare this to the <span>speed of a network-attached storage volume</span>, such as EBS.<!-- --> <!-- -->Read and write requires a short network round trip within a data center.<!-- --> <!-- -->The round trip time is significantly worse, taking about 250,000 nanoseconds (250 microseconds, or 0.25 milliseconds).</p><p>Using the same cutting-edge SSD now takes an <em>order of magnitude</em> longer to fulfill individual read and write requests.<!-- --> <!-- -->When we have large amounts of sequential IO, the negative impact of this can be reduced, but not eliminated.<!-- --> <!-- -->We have introduced significant <em>latency</em> deterioration for every time we need to hit our storage system.</p><p>Another issue with network-attached storage in the cloud comes in the form of limiting IOPS.<!-- --> <!-- -->Many cloud providers that use this model, including AWS and Google Cloud, limit the amount of IO operations you can send over the wire.<!-- --> <!-- -->By default, a GP3 EBS instance on Amazon allows you to send 3000 IOPS per-second, with an additional pool that can be built up to allow for occasional bursts.<!-- --> <!-- -->The following visual shows how this works.<!-- --> <!-- -->Note that the burst balance size is smaller here than in reality to make it easier to see.</p><p>If instead you have your storage attached directly to your compute instance, there are no artificial limits placed on IO operations.<!-- --> <!-- -->You can read and write as fast as the hardware will allow for.</p><p>For as many steps as we've taken forward in IO performance over the years, this seems like a step in the wrong direction.<!-- --> <!-- -->This separation buys some nice conveniences, but at what cost to performance?</p><p>How do we overcome issue 1 (data durability) and 2 (drive scalability) while keeping good IOPS performance?</p><p>Issue 1 can be overcome with replication.<!-- --> <!-- -->Instead of relying on a single server to store all data, we can replicate it onto several computers.<!-- --> <!-- -->One common way of doing this is to have one server act as the primary, which will receive all write requests.<!-- --> <!-- -->Then 2 or more additional servers get all the data replicated to them.<!-- --> <!-- -->With the data in three places, the likelihood of losing data becomes very small.</p><p>Let's look at concrete numbers.<!-- --> <!-- -->As a made up value, say in a given month, there is a 1% chance of a server failing.<!-- --> <!-- -->With a single server, this means we have a 1% chance of losing our data each month.<!-- --> <!-- -->This is an unacceptable for any serious business purpose.<!-- --> <!-- -->However, with three servers, this goes down to 1% × 1% × 1% = 0.0001% chance (1 in one million).<!-- --> <!-- -->At PlanetScale the protection is actually far stronger than even this, as we automatically detect and replace failed nodes in your cluster.<!-- --> <!-- -->We take frequent and reliable backups of the data in your database for added protection.</p><p>Problem 2. can be solved, though it takes a bit more manual intervention when working with directly-attached SSDs.<!-- --> <!-- -->We need to ensure that we monitor and get alerted when our disk approaches capacity limits, and then have tools to easily increase capacity when needed.<!-- --> <!-- -->With such a feature, we can have data permanence, scalability, and blazing fast performance. This is exactly what PlanetScale has built with Metal.</p><p>Planetscale just announced <strong><a href="https://planetscale.com/blog/announcing-metal">Metal</a></strong>, an industry-leading solution to this problem.</p><p>With Metal, you get a full-fledged Vitess+MySQL cluster set up, with each MySQL instance running with a direct-attached NVMe SSD drive.<!-- --> <!-- -->Each Metal cluster comes with a primary and two replicas by default for extremely durable data.<!-- --> <!-- -->We allow you to resize your servers with larger drives with just a few clicks of a button when you run up against storage limits.<!-- --> <!-- -->Behind the scenes, we handle spinning up new nodes and migrating your data from your old instances to the new ones with zero downtime.</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, with a Metal database, there is no artificial cap on IOPS.<!-- --> <!-- -->You can perform IO operations with minimal latency, and hammer it as hard as you want without being throttled or paying for expensive IOPS classes on your favorite cloud provider.</p><p>If you want the ultimate in performance and scalability, <strong><a href="https://planetscale.com/metal">try Metal today</a></strong>.</p></article></div>]]></description>

                  <p>I think your network is the best place to look for this sort of work. Sometimes people will reach out to me with short term projects which is the best way to get gigs like this. Maybe start looking at your colleagues on linkedin, see what they are up to, and think of ways to contribute to what they are working on. The best people to contact in this scenario are leadership and decision makers. A SWE II isn't gonna help you much but a CTO at an early stage startup might be a good person to send a DM if they are friends with you (or even if they aren't!) :)</p>

Push yourself and your services at every opportunity. Send mass emails to friends and old collegues. Write daily puke-inducing posts on LinkedIn. Write blog posts and make toy Github projects with "looking for work" blurbs at the top of each one. Set a goal to post N times a day on X/Threads/LinkedIn/Reddit/wherever else you can think of, and hit those targets. Keep doing all of this for an extended period of time and the leads will start flowing in. Then you need to start putting even more effort into closing those leads and signing contracts.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>New York’s skyscrapers soar above a century-old steam network that still warms the city. While the rest of the world moved to hot water, Manhattanites still buy steam by the megapound.</p><article><div role="presentation"><p>Since 1882, Manhattan has delivered steam into the homes and businesses of its citizens. It is used for: pressing linens at The Waldorf Astoria; cleaning crockery and heating food in restaurants; washing clothes at dry cleaners; sterilizing medical equipment at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital; by the Metropolitan Museum of Art to control the humidity levels and temperatures around its artwork. And it is used by Manhattanites, in both iconic buildings and regular apartment blocks, to heat their space and water.</p>



<!-- --><p>Steam functions like any other utility: produced centrally, metered, and delivered into homes and businesses through a 105-mile-long grid of pipework. Like electricity, sewage, and water, it plays an integral part in the daily operation of the city.</p>



<!-- --><p>Today, the Manhattan steam system is responsible for heating 1.8 billion square feet of residential, 700 million square feet of commercial, and 90 million square feet of industrial floorspace. This represents over three quarters of Manhattan’s total residential footprint.</p>



<!-- --><p>Steam enabled the growth of Manhattan, providing efficient heating to an increasingly vertical city. Many other cities have adopted district-level heating systems, but very few use steam to distribute that energy. Why does some infrastructure survive while others become obsolete?&nbsp;</p>



<!-- --><h3><strong>A short history of heating</strong></h3>



<!-- --><p>Heating represents around <!-- --><a href="https://www.iea.org/energy-system/buildings/heating">half of all global end-user energy consumption</a>. Much of this energy is spent warming homes, offices, and water – for cooking, cleaning, and washing – but roughly half goes toward various industrial uses and a smaller percentage toward agriculture. Keeping spaces warm is amongst the most foundational uses of energy there is.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Before modern central heating, keeping homes warm was inefficient, inconvenient, and sometimes deadly. Most residential buildings would be centered around a fireplace or stove, often burning wood, coal, surplus crops, or dung. Traditional fireplaces are immensely inefficient, <!-- --><a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/wood-and-pellet-heating">drawing in 300 cubic feet of air per minute</a> for combustion and expelling up to 85 percent – along with the heat – up the chimney. They are inconvenient because the fuel source needs to be regularly replenished: felling, hauling, and splitting firewood could take <!-- --><a href="https://www.historiaagraria.com/FILE/articulos/RHA77_warde.pdf">up to two months of human labor</a> per person per year. And they are deadly because these sorts of solid fuels, full of impurities, are highly polluting. <!-- --><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352710223020284">A recent study found</a> that a fireplace pumps out 58 milligrams of particles under 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5s) per kilogram of firewood burnt. This means that every hour you spend in a room with a fireplace burning wood reduces your lifespan by about 18 minutes, equivalent to smoking 1.5 cigarettes..<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Efficiency and pollution concerns motivated the rediscovery and refinement of central heating systems, moving the production of heat away from its consumption. James Watt laid the groundwork in the late 1700s, connecting a system of pipes to a central boiler in his own home.</p>



<!-- --><p>In 1805, William Strutt heated cold air using coal and distributed it throughout homes using ducts; around the same time, some wealthier homes in France began using similar fire-tube hot air furnaces.</p>



<!-- --><p>By 1863, <!-- --><a href="https://www.radrestore.co.uk/about/history">the radiator had taken definitive form</a>, perhaps the most significant breakthrough in modern household heating. Running steam through pipes that have been folded over many times allows for a large amount of surface area in a compact space. The heat is then transferred from the steam into the ambient environment via convection and by directly radiating into the room. Individual radiators can also be fitted with valves, which allows for heating control room-by-room.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>While the radiator allowed for much better distribution of heat within a building, each building needed its own boiler. But on-site boilers, especially those for larger buildings, came with both economic and ergonomic limitations. Steam heating required large boilers, coal storage areas, and extensive piping systems, which take up valuable floor space. As the systems became more advanced, they often also became more complex, necessitating skilled technicians for installation and maintenance.</p>



<!-- --><p>Coal logistics presented its own set of problems. The regular delivery, storage, and handling of large quantities of coal is labor- and space-intensive: heating the Empire State Building would need more than 45 tons of coal per day, roughly two shipping containers’ worth. <!-- --><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/thomas-edison-tinkerer/">Thomas Edison’s</a> first electric power station on Pearl Street opened in 1890 and needed upwards of 20 tons of coal each day. All this coal needed to be moved across bridges or via boat onto Manhattan Island for storage in a city where space was increasingly at a premium. The <!-- --><a href="https://stuffnobodycaresabout.com/2023/01/23/soaring-new-york-real-estate-values-from-1790-to-1889/">price of prime parcels of land increased tenfold</a> between the 1790s and the 1880s, spiking from $400 an acre in 1825 to over $1 million an acre at the end of the century (over $30 million in today’s dollars).<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Nor is all coal created equal. Boilers and furnaces need an expensive class of coal to burn hot enough. <!-- --><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthracite">Anthracite coal</a>, with its high carbon content (between 92 and 98 percent) and few impurities, burns hot and clean but is difficult to light: one exasperated user declared that ‘if the world should take fire, the Lehigh coal mine would be the safest retreat, the last place to burn’. (This would have been a bad strategy: in 1962, the anthracite seam under Centralia, PA – 25 miles to the west of Lehigh County – caught on fire and is still burning today.)<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bituminous_coal">Bituminous coal</a> is much softer, with a lower carbon content (between 45 and 86 percent); it therefore burns less energetically and pollutes much more. <!-- --><a href="https://www.ageofinvention.xyz/p/age-of-invention-how-coal-really">And all coal needs to be stored, handled, and its ashes cleared out</a> regularly.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>The unpleasantness of soot and smoke led US cities to begin to legislate against it in the 1880s, although these restrictions were often ignored. When strikes drove up the price of anthracite in 1902 and some New York City plants switched to bituminous coal, the resulting smoke choked the city, violated local ordinances, <!-- --><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1902/06/07/archives/smoke-pall-hangs-over-the-metropolis-the-use-of-bituminous-coal-on.html">and alarmed residents</a>. Pollution encouraged invention: from the 1830s to the 1880s, the ‘patent office . . . groaned with inventions to save fuel, abolish smoke, evaporate water and utilize steam . . . still leaving a great need unsupplied’, <!-- --><a href="https://www.waterworkshistory.us/DH/1880HollySteam1.pdf">according to a contemporary account</a>.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><h3><strong>The growth of Manhattan in the nineteenth century</strong></h3>



<!-- --><p>Between 1850 and 1900, New York’s population ballooned. Manhattan alone <!-- --><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Manhattan">grew from 515,000 to 1.8 million residents</a>. This increase led to severe overcrowding, with population densities in some areas reaching <!-- --><a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/g3804n.ct001463r/?r=0.41,0.208,0.216,0.179,0">632,000 people per square mile</a>, ten times higher <!-- --><a href="https://www.bensouthwood.co.uk/p/developing-palo-alto-is-worth-1-trillion">than today</a>.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Overcrowding led to both moral and public health concerns, and anti-slum legislation was introduced to try to improve living conditions. This made space in Manhattan still more scarce. Elevated train lines, such as the Ninth Avenue Line, which opened in 1878, allowed the city’s effective size to increase and the partial suburbanization of the outer city. But fares weren’t cheap enough to allow low-wage laborers to commute regularly to and from the new communities forming uptown. If the city were to continue to grow, it would need to build upward.</p>



<!-- --><p>Two major innovations allowed the development of ever-taller buildings. Physically climbing up stairs – bringing food, water, and fuel with you – places a practical limit on how high a building can practically be: as high as land prices rose, no Ancient Roman, medieval Byzantine, or Hausmannian residential building went above six storeys. The introduction of the safety elevator, by Elisha Otis in 1852, made taller buildings practical and desirable. Otis’s design incorporated a safety brake that would engage if the hoisting cable broke, alleviating fears of catastrophic falls.</p>



<!-- --><p>Concurrent with safety elevators was the use of steel building frames. Traditional brick and stone structures face several limitations that prevent them from exceeding around 12 storeys, the most important of which is weight distribution: as a building gets taller, the weight of the upper floors puts enormous pressure on the floors below.</p>



<!-- --><p>Advancements in steel production, including the Bessemer process – oxidizing impurities in molten iron by blowing air through it – made it both affordable and economical to use steel frames, which allowed for a ten times higher strength-to-weight ratio. Designing the building around a skeleton of vertical steel columns and horizontal I-beams allowed buildings to redistribute their weight into this structure, freeing up tensile pressure from the walls and floors. This meant that the rest of the building could be made from lighter non-load-bearing materials, making it possible to build higher still.</p>



<!-- --><p><a href="https://skyscraper.org/skyline/new-york-1876-1900/">So New York shot up.</a> In 1890, the tallest building reached 18 storeys. By 1899, the Park Row Building stretched to 31 stories, and in 1908, the Singer Building soared even higher to 41 stories. Vertical expansion allowed the city to create more residential and commercial space, but that space needed to be heated, powered, and watered.<!-- --></p>

<!-- --><h3><strong>The New York Steam Company</strong></h3>



<!-- --><p>To solve this, New York turned to district heating, an invention of Birdsill Holly (1820–94), a self-made man from Lockport, New York. Holly <!-- --><a href="https://www.adscomfg.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Life-and-Times-of-Birdsill-Holly.pdf">understood the problems of nineteenth century cities deeply</a>. As urban populations swelled, fire risk became catastrophic: large parts of Manhattan would be destroyed in three great fires between 1776 and 1845. Early hand-pumped fire engines could deliver only 30 gallons of water per minute. <!-- --><a href="https://www.arct.cam.ac.uk/system/files/documents/chs-vol.19-pp.87-to-106.pdf">Among Holly’s earliest patents</a> were water pumps such as an ‘elliptical rotary pump’ – the precursor for his <!-- --><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20240522030947/https://www.engine3.org/Silsby/silsbyhistory.html">steam-powered fire engine</a> in 1856.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>His ‘Holly System of Direct Water Supply and Fire Protection for Cities, Towns and Villages’ provided a constant supply of water at pressure to both homes and fire hydrants, lowering costs and removing the need for reservoirs and standpipes. It was so successful that 23 other cities copied it, without crediting Holly, and were later forced by the U.S. Supreme Court to pay him damages. In the 1870s, he began work on a skyscraper project in Niagara Falls, which he then took to Long Island, suggesting that overcrowding could be improved by building upward. Mocked as ‘the farmer from the west’, he abandoned the project altogether and went home to Lockport.</p>



<!-- --><p>Holly returned to plumbing. Drawing from his research in steam-powered pumps, pipework, and urban density, he began to create plans for a district-level heating system. If he could distribute steam to buildings as he had water, then multiple buildings could be heated by a single boiler, reducing fire risk and centralizing heating logistics. He began by running steam through one and a half inch pipes, later upgraded to three inch pipes supported by wooden trenches insulated with <!-- --><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-asbestos-times/">asbestos</a>. The steam would be produced in a boiler in his basement at 31 Chestnut Street and passed across his garden into the houses of his neighbors.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>By 1877, he launched the first practical district-scale test of his system. Over the course of the year, the network was extended to the surrounding area as Holly ironed out the problems and registered customers. Each stage necessitated new inventions: valves used to draw steam off the mains, regulators to stabilize pressure, steam traps to handle condensation, brackets to handle the thermal expansion of the pipes, and meters to measure the flow rate and bill customers accordingly.</p>



<!-- --><p>By the time winter had arrived, 20 houses had been registered. By this stage, the network encompassed three miles of pipe, supplied by three boilers, at a pressure of&nbsp; 25 to 30 pounds per square inch. <!-- --><a href="https://archive.org/details/cihm_18645/page/n9/mode/2up">According to a contemporary account</a>, ‘all the houses, to which steam had been supplied during the winter, had been most comfortably heated, and the discomforts of the old methods done away with . . . heat could be supplied at a much lower cost.’<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>The test was a success, so he incorporated the Holly Steam Combination Company, patenting his more than 50 inventions and exporting district steam heating to other cities. By 1882 at least twenty Holly steam systems were in operation, including: Denver, CO; Auburn, NY; Troy, NY; Springfield, MA; Detroit, MI; and Hartford and New Haven, CT. (The oldest, in Denver, <!-- --><a href="https://difcdn.denverinfill.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/19055143/Denvers-128-Year-Old-Steam-System.pdf">has been running continuously since 1880</a>.) By far the biggest system, however, was in New York City.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Manhattan had some municipal utilities already: in the 1830s, the city had begun to lay water pipes, bringing fresh water from the Croton River in Westchester County through 41 miles of enclosed aqueduct. In the 1850s, private companies such as the Manhattan Gas Light Company started to run gas mains down the avenues, replacing oil lamps across the city.</p>



<!-- --><p>But the idea of distributing steam at city scale was a little more audacious, even in the context of Gilded Age America. It was an associate of John D. Rockefeller, an entrepreneur and ‘popular dandy with a flair for equipage and flowered vests’ called Wallace Andrews, along with his engineering partner, Charles E. Emery, who came across Holly’s designs and decided to implement them in New York City. Andrews worked to arrange the financing and convince the New York City council to permit the development of the steam system. (A task made easier by Edison, who was already digging up the streets to install electrical cabling; Emery and Edison <!-- --><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120228162040/http://www.coned.com/history/steam.asp">even crossed paths underground</a>.)<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>In 1882, its first year of operation, <!-- --><a href="https://time.com/archive/6757202/business-steam-condensed/">New York Steam</a> made $200,000 (about six million dollars adjusted for inflation) in gross revenue. An early steam station was built at 172–176 Greenwich St, on the site of today’s World Trade Center memorial; it contained 64 boilers of 250 horsepower each, distributed across four floors. Coal was brought into the upper levels of the building, where it fed the boilers through a chute; ashes were dropped into the basement of the building in the same fashion. By 1884 the Company had five miles of pipes in active use – feeding steam to 250 consumers, from the Battery in the south up to Murray St, by the modern-day Civic Center – and was profitable.<!-- --></p>

<!-- --><p>Replacing individual boilers with a central system had significant town planning and public health benefits. In a city as dense as Manhattan, coal logistics was a growing concern – <!-- --><a href="https://dn720003.ca.archive.org/0/items/fiftyyearsofnewy00unse/fiftyyearsofnewy00unse.pdf#page=140">the New York Steam Corporation estimated</a> that its central system displaced 1.2 million tons of coal and the smoke from more than 2,500 chimneys, requiring 700 five-ton truckloads per day for 300 days per year to handle the coal and ash – and the risk of dying in a fire was increasing (as were insurance premiums).<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Andrews himself would die in a house fire in 1899. But the system he helped create outlived him and proved remarkably flexible, adapting to the city’s rapid growth both uptown and skyward. As New York expanded, numerous new buildings tapped into its growing steam network, saving them the costs and complexity of building their own heating systems. Each new building made the system that much more efficient because the costs of laying down the pipework and moving the coal could be amortized over more customers’ bills.&nbsp;</p>



<!-- --><p>The first customers were mostly office buildings, such as the First National Bank at Broadway and Wall Street, but users included busy restaurants (one serving ten thousand meals per day), electrical power generators, laundries, and public baths. Network steam was even used to melt snow in the streets. Most of the Art Deco skyscrapers of the 1920s and 1930s were supplied by the New York Steam Company, including the Standard Oil Building, the Ritz Tower Building, the New York Life Insurance Company, the Paramount Building, the Chrysler Building, the Waldorf-Astoria, the Rockefeller Center, and the Empire State.</p>

<!-- --><p>In 1931 – emerging from the financially turbulent 1910s, when the company went into receivership in 1918 – <!-- --><a href="https://time.com/archive/6757202/business-steam-condensed/">its annual profits had reached $2 million</a>. By 1932, it was the largest district heating system in the world, with 65 miles of pipes, bringing heat to more than 2,500 buildings.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><h3><strong>The modern New York steam system</strong></h3>



<!-- --><p>Today, the network, now owned by utilities giant Consolidated Edison – ConEd – operates four steam production sites in Manhattan and one in Queens. They also purchase additional steam from a 322 megawatt plant in Brooklyn, which is managed by a separate company. ConEd’s largest facility sits along the East River, taking up the lion’s share of a city block on 14th Street. At this plant, a dozen massive boilers heat water to approximately 177 degrees celsius and push it into the network at 150 pounds per square inch (roughly equivalent to ten atmospheres).</p>

<!-- --><p>The scale of all this is considerable. The six boiler sites together have a total capacity of roughly <!-- --><a href="https://www.nyiso.com/documents/20142/33938587/20221021%20-%20Steam%20Future%20Overview_NYISO%20(002).pdf">11 and a half million pounds of steam per hour</a>; at peak times they use over nine million. Every gallon of water produces just over eight pounds of steam, which means that the system consumes nearly two Olympic swimming pools’ worth of water per hour during the winter.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Once heated, steam is sent out from plants through large pipes called mains, which are usually between two and three feet in diameter, before spreading through a network of 105 miles of smaller pipes latticed under the city’s streets.</p>



<!-- --><p>The older pipework is made of cast iron, often still coated in the asbestos in which Emery clad them, which can cause problems during regular maintenance and when the pipes crack. (When the last major rupture occurred in 2023, the city shut down seven blocks and washed neighboring buildings and streets out of ‘an abundance of caution’.) New pipes are made from a carbon steel alloy and wrapped in insulation, usually mineral wool, and sit within prefabricated concrete ducts, which both lessens heat loss during transit and also prevents nearby pipes and wiring from being affected.</p>



<!-- --><p>Most of these pipes<!-- --><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Works-Anatomy-City-Kate-Ascher/dp/0143112708"> sit deeper than the other utilities, anywhere from four to 15 feet below street level</a>. The deepest mains pipe runs below the Park Avenue Tunnel, 30 feet underneath the trains shuttling commuters to and from the Bronx and Grand Central. The pipes are accessible through manhole covers in the street, with special telescopic tooling used by workers to open and close the valves that regulate system pressure. Individual sections of pipe are welded together and bound into the concrete with strips of metal called anchors. Metal expands and contracts when heat levels change, so at various points along the mains, the pipes run through expansion joints to absorb this movement safely.<!-- --></p>

(This is structurally similar to electricity grids, where current is transmitted over longer distances at a higher voltage and then reduced at a local substation for local distribution into homes and offices.) Once the steam has passed through the meter and the pressure-reduction substation, most buildings then pipe it through a heat exchanger for distribution into individual apartments and rooms.<!-- --></p>

A thin, flat metal plate with a precisely machined hole in the center, an orifice plate is set within the pipeline, perpendicular to the direction of flow.

All apartment building connections pay a standing service charge of $3,555.43 per month. Usage fees are then added on top, paying anywhere from $11.35 per megapound in the summer to $35.013 during peak season.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p><a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Steam-Buildings-Addresses/s7tr-dj9w/about_data">According to data</a> from the NYC Department of Buildings, 201 East 62nd Street, a mid-century residential building in Midtown with 70 apartments, consumed approximately 5,962 megapounds of steam in 2021. Its steam service cost the building roughly $16,741.23 per month or $239.16 per apartment per month. Lincoln Towers, at 150 West End Avenue, built around the same time, has 454 apartments and pays no less than $47,370.80 per month for its 19,483 megapounds of steam, or $104.34 per apartment per month; the pricing structure strongly rewards density.<!-- --><sup id="ref-2"></sup></p>



<!-- --><p>A large part of the engineering challenge in maintaining the network is managing how the pressure changes as steam moves throughout the system, being drained into buildings as it goes. Engineers can control the inbound pressure for any given customer very accurately using valves on either side of the service valve and monitor usage across the system with sensors. When the pressure gets too high, valves open and vent the steam through a grate, delighting tourists and enraging taxi drivers. If the pressure is too high for a sustained period, ConEd shuts off some of the boilers. If the pressure is too low, ConEd can increase the supply by switching on new boilers or closing valves elsewhere. Large parts of this feedback mechanism are now automated, and modern electronic sensors and high-precision valves allow the system as a whole to run at a high level of efficiency: <!-- --><a href="https://documents.dps.ny.gov/public/Common/ViewDoc.aspx?DocRefId=%7B88298170-D229-4D46-B2B7-2A6AA5B12A03%7D">60 percent, end-to-end</a>.<!-- --><sup id="ref-3"></sup></p>



<!-- --><p>As steam cools, it condenses&nbsp;into water droplets called <!-- --><em>condensate</em>, a substance that accumulates at low points in the piping system. Condensate poses several significant problems. It absorbs oxygen and carbon dioxide, which makes it highly corrosive. The difficulty of accessing the underground infrastructure, especially in older parts of the network, can make this corrosion costly to repair and, in some cases, highly dangerous. Condensate left in pipes can freeze during the winter, leading to blockages and bursts.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>But the most dramatic failure is called a <!-- --><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_hammer"><em>waterhammer</em></a><em>.</em> Sometimes the condensate can form a ‘slug’ of water that fills the entire cross-section of the pipe. When a slug comes into contact with the high-pressure steam, it gets pushed through the piping and accelerated to ridiculous velocities, often reaching over 100 miles per hour (50 meters per second).&nbsp;<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>When this fast-moving water reaches a closed valve, sharp bend, or other obstruction in the pipe, it crashes into whatever it has found, producing a spike of pressure much higher than the standard operating pressure of the system. This can cause significant damage and in some cases total system failures.&nbsp;</p>



<!-- --><p>The last total system failure <!-- --><a href="https://conedison.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/steam-report-bubble-collapse-water-hammer-caused-lexington">was in 2007</a>, when an 82-year-old pipe at 41st and Lexington exploded, showering Midtown in debris.

<!-- --><h3><strong>District heating in the twenty-first century</strong></h3>



<!-- --><p>Steam was a logical choice of heat transfer medium at the turn of the twentieth century, since there was a ready source of it from existing power plants, and its higher temperatures meant it was useful for industrial processes as well as domestic needs. Steam rises, making it a natural choice for tall buildings in dense urban environments. Although steam loses heat as it travels – especially through older systems with poor insulation – its initial high temperature and high energy content mean it can deliver sufficient heat over longer distances.</p>



<!-- --><p>By the 1930s, designers of new systems had switched from using steam to hot water to carry heat. Hot water is now the preferred medium for several reasons.</p>



<!-- --><p>Water systems distribute heat via hot water at temperatures as high as 180 degrees celsius (under a high 147.9 pounds per square inch of pressure so that it doesn’t turn to steam) and as low as 40. Water produces a much higher operating <!-- --><em>efficienc</em>y, measured as the ratio of usable heat delivered to customers to the total energy used at the heat source. Lower temperatures mean a smaller heat differential between the water and the ambient environment, which means less heat loss overall. Similarly, insulation materials are generally more effective at lower temperatures since thermal conductivity tends to increase with temperature. All in all, steam systems usually lose 10-25 percent of their heat during distribution; low temperature water systems can get this as low as 3-5 percent.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Lower temperatures and pressures have other benefits: they reduce the risk of high-pressure accidents and reduce the risk of leaks, meaning easier, safer – and therefore cheaper – system installation and maintenance.</p>



<!-- --><p>Managing condensate also adds much complexity. Condensate needs to be separated from the steam and drained away or pumped through a return pipe back to the boilers to be reused. A majority (usually 50–60 percent) of the capital costs of district heating systems are in the pipework and pumps, which can make return pipes far too expensive to use for larger systems. But draining away the condensate causes a loss of 15 percent of the total energy input, which harms operating efficiency.</p>



<!-- --><p>Hot-water systems also allow for easier integration with renewable energy sources since water can easily be heated to a sub-boiling temperature using an electric-powered immersion heater. <!-- --><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/taming-the-stars/">Nuclear power plants</a> famously use a lot of water&nbsp;– <!-- --><a href="https://smartwatermagazine.com/news/membracon/nuclear-power-and-water-consumption">between 1,514 and&nbsp; 2,725 liters of water per megawatt-hour</a>, <!-- --><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_water_reactor">of which roughly 15 percent is turned into steam</a> – to cool their reactors. Rand reactors in Beznau, Switzerland, and Haiyang, China <!-- --><a href="https://www.powermag.com/district-heating-supply-from-nuclear-power-plants/">already provide hundreds of gigawatt hours</a> of heat output per year to district heating systems. Another source might be data centers, which convert almost all of their electrical power input into heat. An individual large data center can produce 20–50 megawatts of heat; in 2023, global data centers consumed 7.4 gigawatts of power in total, <!-- --><a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/who-we-are/what-london-assembly-does/questions-mayor/find-an-answer/london-annual-energy-usage">enough energy to heat London</a>. Some new developments are even using <!-- --><a href="https://www.newcivilengineer.com/innovative-thinking/harnessing-heat-from-the-tube-11-05-2020/">residual heat from the London Underground</a> via heat pumps to power their district heating systems.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Besides their natural efficiency and amenability to using a variety of renewable heat sources, water-based systems have another interesting benefit: water has a <!-- --><em>thermal capacity</em> 2.08 times greater than steam at 100 degrees, which means that it stores twice as much heat per unit mass. This capacity allows water-based systems to capture energy during periods of low electricity demand or high renewable generation and discharge it as heat later, acting as a form of city-wide energy storage. Using a city’s heating system as a battery is not just useful for the electricity grid, it also enhances the overall efficiency of district heating networks since the networks are able to heat their water when electricity prices are cheaper.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>There are now tens of thousands of district heating systems across the world, especially in Northern and Eastern Europe. Helsinki (870 miles), Copenhagen (over 1,000 miles), Stockholm (1,200 miles), and Vienna (over 750 miles) are all heavy users of district heating. Former Soviet states, with their long history of centralized planning and heating, are particularly reliant: <!-- --><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210203195340/https://www.mos.ru/en/news/item/85762073/">Moscow’s network alone extends over 10,000 miles</a>. These systems are used by a large percentage of cities’ citizens: Copenhagen provides more than 99 percent of the city’s heating needs via district heating, and the Moscow United Energy Company provides heat to 90 percent of Moscow residents.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>In Britain, there are 2,000 heating systems that serve more than one building, more than one third of which are in London. This represents around two percent of UK heat. Perhaps the most famous UK system was a hot-water system in Pimlico, which was opened in 1950 and drew waste heat from Battersea Power Station, providing heat for over 3,000 homes. That system still functions today, although <!-- --><a href="https://www.westminster.gov.uk/housing/pdhu">the City of Westminster is considering</a> refurbishing or closing it due to its age and carbon intensity.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>Some systems <!-- --><a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/252860/de-steaming-project-nears-completion/">are moving away from steam</a>, and new systems are likely to run on hot water. But engineering is the science of the art of trade-offs, and steam does have its benefits. Steam moves around by itself, so it doesn’t need to be pumped to where it’s wanted; water systems have to pump the water back. Steam systems that drain their condensate require roughly half the amount of pipework. And many industrial processes require steam directly. Thus, there may still be circumstances where steam is preferred.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><h3><strong>Where district heating makes sense</strong></h3>



<!-- --><p>District heating is a truly district-level technology. It needs a high density of heat demand: heat loss and infrastructure costs generally make it unviable below a linear heat density (heat sold per meter of network pipe) of two to three megawatt hours per meter per year. This corresponds to a minimum density of roughly 12 dwellings per acre (about 30 dwellings per hectare), <!-- --><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/land-use-change-statistics-2021-to-2022/land-use-change-statistics-new-residential-addresses-2021-to-2022">approximately the average for new suburban developments in the UK</a>, but a fairly high level of density for American suburban development: R1 residential zoning in Los Angeles, with its minimum lot size of 0.114 acres, wouldn’t make the cut, <!-- --><a href="https://laist.com/news/housing-homelessness/heres-how-las-suburban-style-zoning-contributes-to-racial-disparities-uc-berkeley-study">ruling out three quarters of all residential land in the city</a>.<!-- --></p>



<!-- --><p>District heating systems therefore target smaller, denser, developments: housing estates, central business districts, government complexes, and campuses. Many systems are anchored around hospitals, universities, or industrial facilities, which give a reliable base load demand helping to nudge viability upward.</p>



<!-- --><p>But the upfront capital costs are high: according to <!-- --><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a802b44e5274a2e8ab4e95d/heat_networks.pdf">one 2014 study</a>, British district heating networks cost on the order of £1,242 per meter of piping. The dysfunction of infrastructure development in the Anglophone world, with <!-- --><a href="https://transitcosts.com/">its high construction costs</a> and <!-- --><a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/why-britain-doesnt-build/">baroque planning regimes</a>, only compounds these costs.

However, if district heating is to thrive, it will likely need significant policy support and financial incentives to overcome these initial barriers.<!-- --><sup id="ref-4"></sup></p>



<!-- --><p>New York City’s municipal steam system is an iconic anachronism: a fascinating part of the city’s daily life and visual language, a foundational part of its history, and a system that has been exported and refined worldwide. It was an essential technology for its time as the buildings of Manhattan began to reach up and nudge the sky even higher. Future cities likely won’t be powered by hundreds of miles of steam pipes, but significant parts of them may well be heated and cooled by district systems pumping water through highly insulated pipework, stretching out like tentacles under the streets.</p>

<p>Being able to apply statistics is like having a secret superpower.</p>

<p>Where most people see averages, you see confidence intervals.</p>

<p>When someone says “7 is greater than 5”, you declare that they’re really the same.</p>

<p>In a cacophony of noise, you hear a cry for help.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.evanmiller.org/images/formulas/superman.jpg" height="280">
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, not enough programmers have this superpower. That’s a shame, because the application of statistics can almost always enhance the display and interpretation of data.</p><p>As my modest contribution to developer-kind, I’ve collected together the statistical formulas that I find to be most useful; this page presents them all in one place, a sort of statistical cheat-sheet for the practicing programmer.</p>

<p>Most of these formulas can be found in Wikipedia, but others are buried in journal articles or in professors’ web pages. They are all classical (not Bayesian), and to motivate them I have added concise commentary. I’ve also added links and references, so that even if you’re unfamiliar with the underlying concepts, you can go out and learn more. Wearing a red cape is optional.</p>

<h2>1. Formulas For Reporting Averages</h2>

<p>One of the first programming lessons in any language is to compute an average. But rarely does anyone stop to ask: what does the average actually tell us about the underlying data?</p>

<h3>1.1 Corrected Standard Deviation</h3>

<p>The standard deviation is a single number that reflects how <em>spread out</em> the data actually is. It should be reported alongside the average (unless the user will be confused).</p><p>

\[
s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^N(x_i - \bar{x})^2}
\]

</p><p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>\(N\) is the number of observations</li>
    <li>\(x_i\) is the value of the \(i\)<sup>th</sup> observation</li>
    <li>\(\bar{x}\) is the average value of \(x_i\)</li>
</ul>

<p>Reference: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation">Standard deviation (Wikipedia)</a></p>

<h3>1.2 Standard Error of the Mean</h3>

<p>From a statistical point of view, the "average" is really just an <em>estimate</em> of an underlying population mean. That estimate has uncertainty that is summarized by the standard error.</p><p>

\[
SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{N}}
\]

</p><p>Reference: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error">Standard error (Wikipedia)</a></p>

<h3>1.3 Confidence Interval Around the Mean</h3>

<p>A confidence interval reflects the set of statistical hypotheses that won’t be rejected at a given significance level. So the confidence interval around the mean reflects all possible values of the mean that can’t be rejected by the data. It is a multiple of the standard error added to and subtracted from the mean.</p><p>

\[
CI = \bar{x} \pm t_{\alpha/2} SE
\]

</p><p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>\(\alpha\) is the significance level, typically 5% (one minus the confidence level)</li>
    <li>\(t_{\alpha/2}\) is the \(1-\alpha/2\) quantile of a t-distribution with \(N-1\) degrees of freedom</li>
</ul>

<p>Reference: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval#Theoretical_example">Confidence interval (Wikipedia)</a></p>

<h3>1.4 Two-Sample T-Test</h3>

<p>A two-sample t-test can tell whether two groups of observations differ in their mean.</p>

<p>The test statistic is given by:</p><p>

\[
t = \frac{\bar{x_1} - \bar{x_2}}{\sqrt{s^2_1/n_1 + s^2_2/n_2}}
\]

</p><p>The hypothesis of equal means is rejected if \(|t|\) exceeds the \((1-\alpha/2)\) quantile of a t distribution with degrees of freedom equal to:</p><p>

\[
{\rm df} = \frac{(s_1^2/n_1+s_2^2/n_2)^2}{(s_1^2/n_1)^2/(n_1-1)+(s_2^2/n_2)^2/(n_2-1)}
\]

</p><p>You can see a demonstration of these concepts in <a href="https://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/t-test.html">Evan’s Awesome Two-Sample T-Test</a>.</p>

<p>Reference: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-test#Unequal_.28or_equal.29_sample_sizes.2C_unequal_variances">Student’s t-test (Wikipedia)</a></p>

<h2>2. Formulas For Reporting Proportions</h2>

<p>It’s common to report the relative proportions of binary outcomes or categorical data, but in general these are meaningless without confidence intervals and tests of independence.</p>

<h3>2.1 Confidence Interval of a Bernoulli Parameter</h3>

<p>A Bernoulli parameter is the proportion underlying a binary-outcome event (for example, the percent of the time a coin comes up heads). The confidence interval is given by:</p><p>

\[
CI = \left(p + \frac{z^2_{\alpha/2}}{2N} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{[p(1-p) + z^2_{\alpha/2}/4N]/N}\right)/(1+z^2_{\alpha/2}/N)
\]

</p><p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>\(p\) is the observed proportion of interest</li>
    <li>\(z_{\alpha/2}\) is the \((1-\alpha/2)\) quantile of a normal distribution</li>
</ul>

<p>This formula can also be used as a <a href="https://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html">sorting criterion</a>.</p>

<p>Reference: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval#Wilson_score_interval">Binomial proportion confidence interval (Wikipedia)</a></p>

<h3>2.2 Multinomial Confidence Intervals</h3>

<p>If you have more than two categories, a multinomial confidence interval supplies upper and lower confidence limits on all of the category proportions at once. The formula is nearly identical to the preceding one.</p><p>

\[
CI = \left(p_j + \frac{z^2_{\alpha/2}}{2N} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{[p_j(1-p_j) + z^2_{\alpha/2}/4N]/N}\right)/(1+z^2_{\alpha/2}/N)
\]
</p><p>Where:</p>
<ul>

<h3>2.3 Chi-Squared Test</h3>

<p>Pearson’s chi-squared test can detect whether the distribution of row counts seem to differ across columns (or vice versa). It is useful when comparing two or more sets of category proportions.</p>

<p>The test statistic, called \(X^2\), is computed as:</p><p>

\[
X^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^m \frac{(O_{i,j} - E_{i,j})^2}{E_{i,j}}
\]

</p><p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>\(n\) is the number of rows</li>
    <li>\(m\) is the number of columns</li>
    <li>\(O_{i,j}\) is the observed count in row \(i\) and column \(j\)</li>
    <li>\(E_{i,j}\) is the expected count in row \(i\) and column \(j\)</li>
</ul>

<p>The expected count is given by:</p><p>

\[
E_{i,j} = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^nO_{k,j} \sum_{l=1}^mO_{i,l} }{N}
\]
</p><p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>\(N\) is the sum of all the cells, i.e., the total number of observations</li>
</ul>

<p>A statistical dependence exists if \(X^2\) is greater than the (\(1-\alpha\)) quantile of a \(\chi^2\) distribution with \((m-1)\times(n-1)\) degrees of freedom.</p>

<h2>3. Formulas For Reporting Count Data</h2>

<p>If the incoming events are independent, their counts are well-described by a Poisson distribution. A Poisson distribution takes a parameter \(\lambda\), which is the distribution’s mean — that is, the average arrival rate of events per unit time.</p>

<h3>3.1. Standard Deviation of a Poisson Distribution</h3>

<p>The standard deviation of Poisson data usually doesn’t need to be explicitly calculated. Instead it can be inferred from the Poisson parameter:</p><p>

\[
\sigma = \sqrt{\lambda}
\]

</p><p>This fact can be used to read an <a href="https://www.evanmiller.org/how-to-read-an-unlabeled-sales-chart.html">unlabeled sales chart</a>, for example.</p>

<p>Reference: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution">Poisson distribution (Wikipedia)</a></p>

<h3>3.2. Confidence Interval Around the Poisson Parameter</h3>

<p>The confidence interval around the Poisson parameter represents the set of arrival rates that can’t be rejected by the data. It can be inferred from a single data point of \(c\) events observed over \(t\) time periods with the following formula:</p><p>

\[
CI = \left(\frac{\gamma^{-1}(\alpha/2, c)}{t}, \frac{\gamma^{-1}(1-\alpha/2, c+1)}{t}\right)
\]

</p><p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>\(\gamma^{-1}(p, c)\) is the inverse of the lower incomplete gamma function</li>
</ul>

<p>Reference: <a href="http://www.math.mcmaster.ca/peter/s743/poissonalpha.html">Confidence Intervals for the Mean of a Poisson Distribution</a></p>

<h3>3.3. Conditional Test of Two Poisson Parameters</h3>

<p>Please never do this:</p>

<center>
    <img src="https://www.evanmiller.org/images/formulas/count-change.png">
</center>

<p>From a statistical point of view, 5 events is indistinguishable from 7 events. Before reporting in bright red text that one count is greater than another, it’s best to perform a test of the two Poisson means.</p>

<p>The p-value is given by:</p><p>

\[
p = 2\times\frac{c!}{t^c}\times\min\left\{ 
\sum_{i=0}^{c_1} \frac{t_1^i t_2^{c-i}}{i!(c-i)!},
\sum_{i=c_1}^{c} \frac{t_1^i t_2^{c-i}}{i!(c-i)!}
\right\}
\]

</p><p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Observation 1 consists of \(c_1\) events over \(t_1\) time periods</li>
    <li>Observation 2 consists of \(c_2\) events over \(t_2\) time periods</li>
    <li>\(c = c_1 + c_2\) and \(t = t_1 + t_2\)</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Formulas For Comparing Distributions</h2>

<p>If you want to test whether groups of observations come from the same (unknown) distribution, or if a single group of observations comes from a known distribution, you’ll need a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. A K-S test will test the entire distribution for equality, not just the distribution mean.</p>

<h3>4.1. Comparing An Empirical Distribution to a Known Distribution</h3>

<p>The simplest version is a one-sample K-S test, which compares a sample of \(n\) points having an observed cumulative distribution function \(F\) to a known distribution function having a c.d.f. of \(G\). The test statistic is:</p><p>

\[
D_n = \sup_x|F(x) - G(x)|
\]

</p><p>In plain English, \(D_n\) is the absolute value of the largest difference in the two c.d.f.s for any value of \(x\).</p>

<p>The critical value of \(D_n\) at significance level \(\alpha\) is given by \(K_\alpha/\sqrt{n}\), where \(K_\alpha\) is the value of \(x\) that solves:</p><p>

\[
1 - \alpha = \frac{\sqrt{2\pi}}{x}\sum_{k=1}^\infty \exp{\left(-(2k-1)^2\pi^2/(8x^2)\right)}
\]

</p><p>The critical must be solved iteratively, e.g. by Newton’s method. If only the p-value is needed, it can be computed directly by solving the above for \(\alpha\).</p>

<p>Reference: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test">Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test (Wikipedia)</a></p>

<h3>4.2. Comparing Two Empirical Distributions</h3>

<p>The two-sample version is similar, except the test statistic is given by:</p><p>

\[
D_{n_1,n_2} = \sup_x|F_1(x) - F_2(x)|
\]

</p><p>Where \(F_1\) and \(F_2\) are the empirical c.d.f.s of the two samples, having \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) observations, respectively. The critical value of the test statistic is \(K_\alpha/\sqrt{n_1 n_2/(n_1 + n_2)}\) with the same value of \(K_\alpha\) above.</p>

<p>Reference: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test#Two-sample_Kolmogorov.E2.80.93Smirnov_test">Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test (Wikipedia)</a></p>

<h3>4.3. Comparing Three or More Empirical Distributions</h3>

<p>A \(k\)-sample extension of Kolmogorov-Smirnov was described by J. Kiefer in a <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/2237091">1959 paper</a>. The test statistic is:</p><p>

\[
T = \sup_x \sum_{j=1}^k n_j |F_j(x) - \bar{F}(x)|
\] 

</p><p>Where \(\bar{F}\) is the c.d.f. of the combined samples. The critical value of \(T\) is \(a^2\) where \(a\) solves:</p><p>

\[
1 - \alpha = \frac{4}{\Gamma\left(\frac{h}{2}\right)2^{h/2}a^h} 
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{(\gamma_{(h-2)/2,n})^{h-2}\exp[-(\gamma_{(h-2)/2,n})^2/2a^2]}{[J_{h/2}(\gamma_{(h-2)/2,n})]^2}
\]

</p><p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>\(h=k-1\)</li>
    <li>\(J_{h/2}\) is a Bessel function of the first kind with order \(h/2\)</li>
    <li>\(\gamma_{(h-2)/2,n}\) is the \(n\)<sup>th</sup> zero of \(J_{(h-2)/2}\)
</li></ul>

<p>To compute the critical value, this equation must also be solved iteratively. When \(k=2\), the equation reduces to a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The case of \(k=4\) can also be reduced to a simpler form, but for other values of \(k\), the equation cannot be reduced.</p>

<p>Reference: <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/2237091">K-sample analogues of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Cramer-v. Mises tests (JSTOR)</a></p>

<h2>5. Formulas For Drawing a Trend Line</h2>

<p>Trend lines (or best-fit lines) can be used to establish a relationship between two variables and predict future values.</p>

<h3>5.1. Slope of a Best-Fit Line</h3>

<p>The slope of a best-fit (least squares) line is:</p><p>

\[
m = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^N(x_i - \bar{x})^2}
\]

</p><p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>\(\{x_1, \ldots, x_N\}\) is the independent variable with sample mean \(\bar{x}\)</li>
    <li>\(\{y_1, \ldots, y_N\}\) is the dependent variable with sample mean \(\bar{y}\)</li>
</ul>

<h3>5.2. Standard Error of the Slope</h3>

<p>The standard error around the estimated slope is:</p><p>

\[
SE = \frac{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^N(y_i - \bar{y} - m (x_i - \bar{x}))^2/(N-2)}}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^N(x_i - \bar{x})^2}}
\]

<a name="trend_ci"></a></p><h3>5.3. Confidence Interval Around the Slope</h3>

<p>The confidence interval is constructed as:</p><p>

\[
CI = m \pm t_{\alpha/2} SE
\]
</p><p>Where:</p>
<ul>
    <li>\(\alpha\) is the significance level, typically 5% (one minus the confidence level)</li>
    <li>\(t_{\alpha/2}\) is the \(1-\alpha/2\) quantile of a t-distribution with \(N-2\) degrees of freedom</li>
</ul>

			"For it is true that astronomy, from a popular standpoint, is handicapped by the inability of the average workman to 
			own an expensive astronomical telescope. It is also true that if an amateur starts out to build a telescope just for 
			fun he will find, before his labors are over, that he has become seriously interested in the wonderful mechanism of 
			our universe. And finally there is understandably the stimulus of being able to unlock the mysteries of the 
			heavens by a tool fashioned by one's own hand."</p>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<p>A lot has changed since Russell Porter wrote those 
			words - today the "average workman" can afford to buy an already 
			made telescope and Dobsonian mountings are very popular.&nbsp; Much 
			is also unchanged - mirror grinding techniques are very similar to 
			those written up by Porter and Ingalls in the 20´s and 30´s. Many 
			amateur astronomers still choose to fabricate their own instruments, 
			for the pride of accomplishment, the gaining of knowledge and the 
			insurance of quality. Telescope making is at the heart of the 
			Springfield Telescope Makers - after all it is two thirds of our 
			club's name - and on these pages we hope to show you that you too 
			can make your own telescope - and it can be an excellent performer!</p>

			<p><b>A note on ATM techniques:</b> There are almost as many ways to 
			make mirrors and telescopes as there are telescope makers. On these 
			pages we present one or more ways that have worked for us, but that 
			doesn't mean there aren't many other valid approaches. In fact, many 
			of us enjoy ATMing because we can experiment with different 
			techniques and sometimes find better ways of making or building a 
			telescope. And even if our new technique isn't better, we usually 
			learn something valuable in the process. On these pages, however, we 
			have tried to stick with simple and proven techniques that are most 
			appropriate for novice mirror and telescope makers, and are 
			generally what we teach beginners at the <a href="https://stellafane.org/tm/mc/index.html">
			Stellafane Mirror Class</a>.</p>

				to know how it is done - with <u>your</u> bare hands and a few <b>
				simple</b> tools, you can grind and figure a fine mirror with a

              <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Yesterday I installed Cursor and currently on Pro Trial. After coding a bit I found out that it can’t go through 750-800 lines of code and when asked why is that I get this message:<br>
</p><div><a href="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex020/uploads/cursor1/original/3X/a/b/ab177027c0693000ad59262e3086284b6d75b2f9.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/opxRwKvjSkAPNtkr1zZ4MnWpcIF.png?dl=1" title="image" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex020/uploads/cursor1/original/3X/a/b/ab177027c0693000ad59262e3086284b6d75b2f9.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="opxRwKvjSkAPNtkr1zZ4MnWpcIF" width="545" height="339"></a></div>
<p>Not sure if LLMs know what they are for (lol), but doesn’t matter as a much as a fact that I can’t go through 800 locs. Anyone had similar issue? It’s really limiting at this point and I got here after just 1h of vibe coding</p>

              <p>Lol yes the message is actually funny. Not sure why it would write that in reality, never saw it happen.</p>
<p>So, in general its a bad idea to have huge files with code.<br>
Not just because of AI context limit but also for humans to handle them.<br>
Too big files are often a sign that a project is not well structured and the concerns of each file/class/function etc are not separate from each other.</p>
<p>It also seems you are not using the Chat window with the integrated ‘Agent’ which would create that file for you easier than in the ‘editor’ part of Cursor.</p>

              <p>oh, I didn’t know about the Agent part - I just started out and just got to it straight out. Maybe I should actually read the docs on how to start lol</p>
<p>Should I ask it to chunk it out?</p>

              <p>So as you are starting with Cursor i highly recommend going through the Docu to learn what it can do… and how to use each part</p>


<p>Yes it would help to ask it to split parts, depends on what language you use (looks like JS?), AI can then use import statements to include those separate files into your ‘start file’.</p>
<p>Usually its a good idea to do modular programming (split functionality into modules or classes or functions, depending on language or framework).<br>
If you tell AI to use for example Single Responsibility Principle as guideline when coding it will not mix different features in one file. You may also create rules (see docs) that tell the AI for example to keep files under 500 lines limit (a bit over is not tragic but the more lines the harder it will be for AI)…</p>

            <p>Hey <a href="https://forum.cursor.com/u/t1000">@T1000</a> . Thanks for your advice the other day, my post got deleted for an unknown reason, but I decided to go ahead and purchase a one month cursor pro subscription as you advised, I didn’t experience any major problems with the new releases and I’m enjoying it.</p>

<p>could it be related with some extended inference from your rule set?</p>

<p>U.S. Representative Jamie Raskin is encouraging all U.S. citizens to join him this week in filing formal demands for access to their personal data obtained by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and Elon Musk.</p>



<p>The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia has issued an injunction commanding DOGE to comply with citizen requests under the Freedom of Information Act. This law encompasses the Federal Privacy Act of 1974, which entitles any citizen to access personal information held in any U.S. government records system. Please find a fillable Privacy Act request form <a href="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ak-raskin/images/Raskin_DOGE_Privacy_Request.pdf"><strong>HERE</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Citizens need only fill out the form and mail it in to DOGE.&nbsp; This newly recognized federal agency, which has been systematically accessing government computer data systems, now has an obligation to respond to specific information demands from any of the 340 million U.S. citizens who exercise their legal right to defend their privacy and establish the security of their private information.</p>



<p>Once you have mailed a Privacy Act Request to DOGE, please fill out the form <a href="https://act.jamieraskin.com/signup/doge_privacy/"><strong>HERE</strong></a> and we will stay in touch with additional details and updates as they become available.</p>
