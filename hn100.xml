<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>[This post is adapted from our forthcoming book, <em>Preserving Government Information: Past, Present, and Future</em>.]</p>
<p>Today we want to clarify something important about preserving government information. There is a difference between the government changing a policy and the government erasing information, but the line between those two has blurred in the digital age.</p>
<p>When a new president is inaugurated, one expects new policies. The number of changes and the speed of change may vary for different administrations, but we expect that every administration will be different in some ways from its predecessor. After all, that is part of the reason we have elections. Also, information that the government publishes is updated all the time, not just when administrations change. Laws and regulations are added and amended and rescinded, new economic and environmental and census data are collected and published, government recommendations to the public (like the Department of Agriculture’s “food pyramid” guidance) are revised. </p>
<p>Changes in government information are normal in a democracy.</p>
<p>Because change is normal, it is essential to preserve government information – even “non-current” and “out of date” information – in order to document those changes. This is not a new idea, but a long-accepted principle of democracy. Citizens need a record of what a government’s stated values were and when they changed, what actions it took and when it took them, what data it collected and generated at specific points in time, and so forth. It is important to preserve even information that later proves to be inaccurate in order to document what the government knew and when it knew it. </p>
<p>Because published government information is the evidence for a democracy, its preservation is essential.</p>
<p>In the era in which government information was published in paper formats, preservation of that information relied on libraries. The information was distributed to FDLP libraries based on the needs of the communities that those libraries served. Beginning in 1962, Regional FDLs received and retained all the paper publications in the FDLP system. When new information superseded or replaced old information, the old information was not erased or discarded; it was preserved in Regional FDLs and in every FDL whose community valued that older information. In the print era, it was taken for granted that, once government information was released to the public, it would not be withdrawn or altered or lost.<sup><a id="return1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> </p>
<p>In the digital age, government publishing has shifted from the distribution of unalterable printed books to digital posts on government websites. Such digital publications can be moved, altered, and withdrawn at the flick of a switch. Publishing agencies are not required to preserve their own information, nor to provide free access to it. </p>
<p>Some digital government information is actively preserved by GPO, NARA, and the Library of Congress. Some government-collected data are preserved by law or by tradition. But the laws that allow this are weak and government preservation of government information suffers from large gaps. Non-government projects (notably the <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> and the <a href="https://eotarchive.org/">End-of-Term Archive</a>) use web harvesting to attempt to acquire and store government information, but these projects are, by their nature, incomplete and their long-term guarantees of access are fragile. As a result of all this, the public can no longer assume that any given piece of government information will not be withdrawn or altered or lost. </p>
<p>The early actions of the incoming Trump administration (as well as the actions of the first Trump administration) have brought the vulnerability of digital information to the public’s attention (see our previous post “<a href="https://freegovinfo.info/node/14744/">Federal information scrubbing has begun</a>”) and the public is rightfully worried. That vulnerability is, however, not limited to this administration. Digital government information was being lost before President Trump. </p>
<p>The current crisis of imminent loss of information exists not only because government information is being changed, but because it is being erased. The erasure is possible because of the gaps in the current preservation infrastructure. </p>
<p>The scale of loss and alteration of information under Trump may prove to be unprecedented and certainly requires immediate short-term action. But librarians and archivists and citizens should use this current crisis to demand more than short-term solutions. A new distributed digital preservation infrastructure is needed for digital government information.</p>

<p>Water managers were relieved Thursday evening after the Army Corps of Engineers agreed to back off of a sudden decision earlier in the day to dump massive amounts of water from Kaweah and Success lakes.</p>



<p>Water managers said they got about an hour’s warning from the Army Corp’s Sacramento office to expect the Tule and Kaweah rivers to be at “channel capacity” by Thursday night.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Channel capacity means the maximum amount of water a river can handle. For the Kaweah, that’s 5,500 cubic feet per second and for the Tule, it’s 3,500 cfs.</p>



<p>Those levels were last seen, and surpassed, during the 2023 floods, which destroyed dozens of homes and businesses and caused significant damage to infrastructure.</p>



<p>“We were able to get them to back off that,” said Eric Limas, General Manager of the Lower Tule River and Pixley irrigation districts, of the Army Corps. “They’ll still be releasing water sometime tonight, but it will be a smaller amount, which will increase tomorrow.”</p>



<p>Limas and Tulare Irrigation District General Manager Aaron Fukuda were unsure how high releases would ultimately go and for how long but Kaweah has about 27,000 acre feet and Success about 5,000 acre fee that are above levels allowed by the Army Corps during winter.</p>



<p>Water managers will continue working with the Army Corps to limit the amount of water released from the lakes, Fukuda said.</p>



<p>“We’re still trying to wrap our minds around the numbers that made this happen,” Fukuda said. “We haven’t received much information from the Army Corps, just very vague answers.”</p>



<p>Rick Brown, chief public affairs officer for the Sacramento office of the Army Corps, would only say that levels in both lakes were “currently in the flood control space.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>He directed further questions to the Army Corps’ headquarters, which did not return an email Thursday asking: Who made the decision to release the water? Why? Why so suddenly? And why weren’t safety personnel notified?</p>



<p>Some people interviewed for this story speculated that the move was political on the part of the new administration, a kind of water “flex,” but declined to elaborate.</p>



<p>Tulare County Sheriff Mike Boudreaux said one of his officers had heard about the pending releases through the grapevine late Thursday afternoon and they were getting conflicting information through the evening.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Tule River goes through the heart of Porterville and there are a number of <a href="https://sjvwater.org/planning-and-coordination-kept-porterville-dry-during-floods-but-the-rest-of-the-san-joaquin-valley-remains-fragmented/">agreements</a> about how releases should be made, including notifications to first responders, which is why Porterville didn’t flood in 2023.</p>



<p>Army Corps reservoirs are required to be drawn down every fall to make room for winter storms and later runoff.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the Army Corps typically works with downstream agricultural users to allow them to keep a bit more water in the lakes to hedge against dry years, such this one is shaping up to be.</p>



<p>Kaweah River Water Master Victor Hernandez said Lake Kaweah’s winter capacity is 12,000 acre feet, but had been allowed to go up to 39,000 acre feet after an aerial snow survey showed the watershed currently only has another 45,000 acre feet in snow cover.</p>



<p>“Even if everything came down at once, it would only be enough to fill the reservoir halfway,” he said. “We were on track with the Corps working with the models and forecasts and doing our planning and then I get a call at 2:15 p.m. telling me they were going to channel capacity.”</p>



<p>Hernandez was floored.</p>



<p>“In 25 years, I’ve never seen anything like this,” he said. “I was given no explanation at all.”</p>



<p>Before they got word of the Army Corp’s decision to release less water, Hernandez, Fukuda and Limas were planning for the worst.</p>



<p>Hernandez had already notified managers on the old Tulare Lake Bed to expect possible flood water. And Limas and Fukuda had crews ready to work through the night stripping out weirs and channel guides, which were only recently rebuilt after the 2023 floods, to keep the water moving.</p>



<p>“Normally, these kinds of flood releases are done with a lot of notification and coordination,” Fukuda said. “I’ve been doing this 18 years and have never seen something like this.”</p>



<p>The Army Corps also operates Isabella and Pine Flat lakes on the Kern and Kings rivers, respectively.</p>



<p>Kern River Watermaster Art Chianello and Kings River Watermaster Steve Haugen both said they had not received notice of flood releases from Isabella and Pine Flat.</p>



<p>But neither of those lake levels are above their winter allowance, Haugen said.</p>

            <guid>42894215</guid>
            <pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 00:24:42 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/31/o3-mini/">https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/31/o3-mini/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42894215">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-permalink-context="/2025/Jan/31/o3-mini/">

<p>31st January 2025</p>



<p>OpenAI’s <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/">o3-mini is out today</a>. As with other o-series models it’s a slightly difficult one to evaluate—we now need to decide if a prompt is best run using GPT-4o, o1, o3-mini or (if we have access) o1 Pro.</p>
<p>Confusing matters further, the benchmarks in <a href="https://openai.com/index/o3-mini-system-card/">the o3-mini system card</a> (PDF) aren’t a universal win for o3-mini across all categories. It generally benchmarks higher than GPT-4o and o1 but not across everything.</p>
<p>The biggest win for o3-mini is on the Codeforces ELO competitive programming benchmark, which I think is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01257">described by this 2nd January 2025 paper</a>, with the following scores:</p>
<ul>
<li>o3-mini (high) 2130</li>
<li>o3-mini (medium) 2036</li>
<li>o1 1891</li>
<li>o3-mini (low) 1831</li>
<li>o1-mini 1650</li>
<li>o1-preview 1258</li>
<li>GPT-4o 900</li>
</ul>
<p>Weirdly, that GPT-4o score was in an older copy of the System Card PDF which has been replaced by an updated document that doesn’t mention Codeforces ELO scores at all.</p>
<p>One note from the System Card that stood out for me concerning intended applications of o3-mini for OpenAI themselves:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We also plan to allow users to use o3-mini to search the internet and summarize the results in ChatGPT. We expect o3-mini to be a useful and safe model for doing this, especially given its performance on the jailbreak and instruction hierarchy evals detailed in Section 4 below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is notable because the existing o1 models on ChatGPT have not yet had access to their web search tool—despite the mixture of search and “reasoning” models having very clear benefits.</p>
<p>o3-mini does not and <a href="https://twitter.com/nikunjhanda/status/1885415728624656481">will not</a> support vision. We will have to wait for future OpenAI reasoning models for that.</p>
<p>I released <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-21">LLM 0.21</a> with support for the new model, plus its <code>-o reasoning_effort high</code> (or <code>medium</code> or <code>low</code>) option for tweaking the reasoning effort—details <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/728">in this issue</a>.</p>
<p>Note that the new model is currently only available for <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits/usage-tiers#tier-3-rate-limits">Tier 3</a> and higher users, which requires you to have spent at least $100 on the API.</p>
<p>o3-mini <a href="https://openai.com/api/pricing/">is priced</a> at $1.10/million input tokens, $4.40/million output tokens—less than half the price of GPT-4o (currently $2.50/$10) and massively cheaper than o1 ($15/60).</p>
<p>I tried using it to summarize <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42890627">this conversation about o3-mini on Hacker News</a>, using <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/claude-hacker-news-themes#user-content-adding-a--m-model-option">my hn-summary.sh script</a>.</p>

<div><pre>hn-summary.sh 42890627 -o o3-mini</pre></div>

<p>Here’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/09e5922be0cbb85894cf05e6d75ae050">the result</a>—it used 18,936 input tokens and 2,905 output tokens for a total cost of 3.3612 cents.</p>

<p>Another characteristic worth noting is o3-mini’s token output limit—the measure of how much text it can output in one go.  That’s 100,000 tokens, compared to 16,000 for GPT-4o and just 8,000 for both DeepSeek R1 and Claude 3.5.</p>

<p>Invisible “reasoning tokens” come out of the same budget, so it’s likely not possible to have it output the full 100,000.</p>

<p>The model accepts up to 200,000 tokens of input, an improvement on GPT-4o’s 128,000.</p>

<p>An application where output limits really matter is translation between human languages, where the output can realistically be expected to have a similar length to the input. It will be interesting seeing how well o3-mini works for that, especially given its low price.</p>

It hasn’t taken similar steps (yet) in 2025, but <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/28/google-employees-petition-for-job-security-ahead-of-expected-cuts-.html">employees are fearing the worst</a>. And if the Platforms and Devices team is anything to go by, there’s ample reason for concern. Google has distributed a memo to all US employees working on Android, Pixel hardware, and other projects that offers a “voluntary exit program” guaranteeing severance for anyone willing to step away from their role at the company. The memo went out from platforms and devices SVP Rick Osterloh, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/30/pixel-android-voluntary-exit-employees/">according to <em>9to5Google</em></a>.</p><p>“This comes after we brought two large organizations together last year,” Osterloh wrote. “There’s tremendous momentum on this team and with so much important work ahead, we want everyone to be deeply committed to our mission and focused on building great products, with speed and efficiency.” Voluntary buyouts can often be a precursor to layoffs if not enough employees take Google up on its offer and choose to leave.</p><p>Google <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24133881/google-android-pixel-teams-reorg-rick-osterloh">combined its Android and hardware teams</a> under Osterloh in April. Executives said the streamlined approach would help it integrate AI features across products and services more quickly.</p><p>A few months later in October, Alphabet’s chief finance officer Anat Ashkenazi said she would prioritize “cost efficiencies” throughout the company. “There’s really good work that was done, started by Ruth, Sundar and the rest of the lead team to re-engineer the cost base,” she said during her first earnings call as CFO. “But I think any organization can always push a little further and I’ll be looking at additional opportunities.” The cost-cutting measures are partly designed to offset Google pouring so much money into AI.</p><p>Google’s Pixel phones have never come anywhere close to the sales numbers enjoyed by Apple and Samsung, but the company is at least trending in the right direction; <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/global-smartphone-market-q3-2024">Counterpoint Research reported</a> that Google recorded its highest-ever quarterly sales volume for smartphones in Q3 2024.</p><p>Some employees at Google have recently been circulating a petition that calls for CEO Sundar Pichai to offer exactly this type of optional buyout before resorting to involuntary layoffs. “Ongoing rounds of layoffs make us feel insecure about our jobs,” the petition said, according to CNBC. “The company is clearly in a strong financial position, making the loss of so many valuable colleagues without explanation hurt even more.”</p><p>At least for the time being, it appears the voluntary exit program hasn’t been extended to other divisions within Google like search or the DeepMind AI team.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Elon Musk’s Tesla paid a total of $0 in federal income taxes in 2024, new tax reports show, despite the company having raked in billions of dollars in income and being the most valuable car company in the world.</p>



<p>Citing Tesla’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000162828025003063/tsla-20241231.htm">year-end financial report</a> released this week, the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) <a href="https://itep.org/tesla-reported-zero-federal-income-tax-in-2024/">reports</a> that Tesla paid a 0 percent federal income tax rate last year, even as the company reported $2.3 billion in income.</p>



<p>In 2023, Tesla paid $48 million in taxes on $3.1 billion in income — a 1.5 percent rate. And, in 2022, when it reported $5.5 billion in income, Tesla also paid a 0 percent tax rate. </p>



<p>This brings Tesla’s average tax rate over the past three years to 0.4 percent, or 50 times less than the statutory corporate tax rate of 21 percent. </p>



<p>This is despite the fact that Tesla is valued at <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/">over $1.2 trillion</a> and is owned by the richest man in the world, with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/elon-musk/">a net worth of</a> over $400 billion and who was awarded <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/12/3/musks-fifty-five-point-eight-bn-tesla-pay-package-rejected-by-us-judge">a $101 billion</a> pay package by Tesla shareholders last year — though this package has been rejected by a judge. </p>




<p>Due to the nature of the U.S. tax system, which heavily favors corporations and the wealthy and enables sophisticated tax dodging methods, Musk is also <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax">one of the many</a> ultrarich Americans who pay a far lower tax rate than the average American. Advocates for fairer taxation <a href="https://americansfortaxfairness.org/musks-11-billion-tax-bill-big-news-just-10-wealth-increase-far-year/">have said</a> that, due to the way that tax law is written and enforced, it is essentially optional for Musk and other billionaires to follow tax guidelines, allowing them to hoard more and more wealth while the working class struggles to get by.</p>



<p>According to ITEP, Tesla was able to avoid paying $500 million in taxes by using accelerated depreciation, <a href="https://itep.org/corporate-tax-avoidance-under-the-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act/">a tax avoidance method</a> and incentive for businesses which allows companies to write off the costs of an asset faster than it would normally actually lose value. The company dodged another $300 million in its tax bill by claiming “unspecified ‘U.S. tax credits,’” ITEP said.</p>



<p>Companies’ ability to use accelerated depreciation as a tax avoidance method was expanded by Donald Trump and Republicans’ Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017, which slashed the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 percent and <a href="https://truthout.org/articles/us-billionaires-have-doubled-their-wealth-since-2017-trump-tax-overhaul/">has supercharged</a> the growth of the wealth gap in the U.S., creating an explosion of wealth for the richest Americans.</p>



<p>Trump and the GOP have pledged to be extremely friendly to corporations in Trump’s second term in office. The president campaigned on tax cuts across the board — but research has found that his tax plans would <a href="https://itep.org/kamala-harris-donald-trump-tax-plans/">actually raise taxes</a> for the working class while cutting taxes for the top 5 percent richest Americans.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Republicans <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-tax-cuts-congress-republicans-plan-slash-benefits">are reportedly circulating</a> options to expand the already massive tax benefits given to corporations and the wealthy in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — options that include slashing benefits for working class Americans in order to cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent. This could give massive corporations like Tesla yet more tax cuts.</p>



<p>ITEP points out that there are also bipartisan proposals to give corporations more tax dodging tools, like <a href="https://itep.org/impacts-of-tax-relief-for-american-families-and-workers-act/">a compromise bill</a> proposed in the Senate last year that would, among other things, retroactively give companies the ability to receive a tax break on supposed research — though the bill gives an extremely wide definition of what a company could qualify as research.</p>

<h5>We’re not backing down in the face of Trump’s threats.</h5>
<p><span>As Donald Trump is inaugurated a second time, independent media organizations are faced with urgent mandates: Tell the truth more loudly than ever before. Do that work even as our standard modes of distribution (such as social media platforms) are being manipulated and curtailed by forces of fascist repression and ruthless capitalism. Do that work even as journalism and journalists face targeted attacks, including from the government itself. And do that work in community, never forgetting that we’re not shouting into a faceless void – we’re reaching out to real people amid a life-threatening political climate.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Our task is formidable, and it requires us to ground ourselves in our principles, remind ourselves of our utility, dig in and commit.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>As a dizzying number of corporate news organizations – either through need or greed – rush to implement new ways to further monetize their content, and others acquiesce to Trump’s wishes, now is a time for movement media-makers to double down on community-first models.</span></p>
<p><span>At <em>Truthout</em>, we are reaffirming our commitments on this front: We won’t run ads or have a paywall because we believe that everyone should have access to information, and that access should exist without barriers and free of distractions from craven corporate interests. We recognize the implications for democracy when information-seekers click a link only to find the article trapped behind a paywall or buried on a page with dozens of invasive ads. The laws of capitalism dictate an unending increase in monetization, and much of the media simply follows those laws. <strong><em>Truthout</em> and many of our peers are dedicating ourselves to following other paths – a commitment which feels vital in a moment when corporations are evermore overtly embedded in government.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Over 80 percent of<em> Truthout</em>‘s funding comes from small individual donations from our community of readers, and the remaining 20 percent comes from a handful of social justice-oriented foundations. Over a third of our total budget is supported by recurring monthly donors, many of whom give because they want to help us keep <em>Truthout</em> barrier-free for everyone.</span></p>
<p><span>You can help by giving today. Whether you can make a small monthly donation or a larger gift, <em>Truthout</em> only works with your support.</span></p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Explanation</h2><a id="user-content-explanation" aria-label="Permalink: Explanation" href="#explanation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This works in a very similar way to my previous <a href="https://github.com/ading2210/doompdf">DoomPDF</a> project.</p>
<p dir="auto">You might expect PDF files to only be comprised of static documents, but surprisingly, the PDF file format supports Javascript with its own separate standard library. Modern browsers (Chromium, Firefox) implement this as part of their PDF engines. However, the APIs that are available in the browser are much more limited.</p>
<p dir="auto">The full specfication for the JS in PDFs was only ever implemented by Adobe Acrobat, and it contains some ridiculous things like the ability to do <a href="https://opensource.adobe.com/dc-acrobat-sdk-docs/library/jsapiref/JS_API_AcroJS.html#annot3d" rel="nofollow">3D rendering</a>, make <a href="https://opensource.adobe.com/dc-acrobat-sdk-docs/library/jsapiref/JS_API_AcroJS.html#net-http" rel="nofollow">HTTP requests</a>, and <a href="https://opensource.adobe.com/dc-acrobat-sdk-docs/library/jsapiref/JS_API_AcroJS.html#monitor" rel="nofollow">detect every monitor connected to the user's system</a>. However, on Chromium and other browsers, only a tiny subset of this API was ever implemented, due to obvious security concerns. With this, we can do whatever computation we want, just with some very limited IO.</p>
<p dir="auto">C code can be compiled to run within a PDF using an old version of Emscripten that targets <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asm.js" rel="nofollow">asm.js</a> instead of WebAssembly. With this, I can compile a modified version of the TinyEMU RISC-V emulator to asm.js, which can be run within the PDF. For the input and output, I reused the same display code that I used for DoomPDF. It works by using a separate text field for each row of pixels in the screen, whose contents are set to various ASCII characters. For inputs, there is a virtual keyboard implemented with a bunch of buttons, and a text box you can type in to send keystrokes to the VM.</p>
<p dir="auto">The largest problem here is with the emulator's performance. For example, the Linux kernel takes about 30-60 seconds to boot up within the PDF, which over 100x slower than normal. Unfortunately, there's no way to fix this, since the version of V8 that Chrome's PDF engine uses has its <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/_/pdfium/pdfium/+/012fe571c9fe430da68dbcd2f5ba21758db0ae15:fpdfsdk/fpdf_view.cpp;l=1211-1214;drc=b69783fd189976dd4625c7dcd9c07921b94d4a3c;bpv=0;bpt=0" rel="nofollow">JIT compiler disabled</a>, destroying its performance.</p>
<p dir="auto">For the root filesystem, there are both 64 and 32 bit versions possible. The default is a 32 bit buildroot system (which was prebuilt and taken from the original TinyEMU examples), and also a 64 bit Alpine Linux system. The 64 bit emulator is about as twice slow however, so it's normally not used.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>R</span>ecently, AI music company Suno’s CEO was <a href="https://www.404media.co/ceo-of-ai-music-company-says-people-dont-like-making-music/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">quoted as saying “I think the majority of people don’t enjoy the majority of the time they spend making music”</a> in what sounds like yet another justification of Suno’s prompt-based (and very popular) generative AI music service. Like all good misleading statements, this one is partially based on truth: when we work at our favorite activities — cooking, gaming, hiking, music-making, writing (to name a few) — the process is often not easy or pleasant or smooth. Many musicians spend vastly more time in practice rooms than onstage; gamers willingly play punishingly difficult video games; hikers go up and down big mountains while dealing with blisters, mosquitos, and a host of inconveniences. All of these are arguably not “enjoyable” the majority of the time, and yet people still choose to undertake these activities. Why? Well, Suno quietly leaves out the part that the <em>process</em> (with its inherent challenges) is often what makes an activity ultimately meaningful and fulfilling. It’s like Suno telling hikers and mountaineers that clambering up a mountain is unpleasant business! Why not take a helicopter to the summit? Meanwhile, Suno is selling helicopter tickets.</p><p>Statements like Suno’s perfectly captures the prevailing public mindset about AI: that Artificial Intelligence is little more than a labor-saving optimization tool. This mindset tends to be good for #Capitalism, but betrays not only a lack of understanding of why people make music, but also a profound lack of imagination regarding how we could, or would want to live with our technologies in our lives. I, for one, would go as far as to say using generative AI for creative expression in this manner (“describe what you have in mind and AI will create it for you”) amounts to<em><strong> </strong></em>the least imaginative of use of AI that I can imagine. Such systems offer the promise of skipping the labor by bypassing the creative process and, yes, the difficulties, confusion, and frustration inherent in such endeavors, but…</p><p><em>What if the point of art is that we actually </em><strong>make</strong><em> it?</em></p><h2 id="2d7c"><strong>“What’s Your Story?”</strong></h2><p>I do not despise AI, per se, but I am forever wary of people who make and deploy technology in uncritical, culturally apathetic ways. I am pretty sure this makes me something of an Old Fart; or maybe I have always been that. But I do have some background in this topic.

But before I even set foot on Princeton’s impeccably manicured campus, brimming with classic Gothic architecture, cherry blossom trees, and well-kept lawns — something, or rather someone, gave me pause on my aspirations.</p><p>On my drive up to New Jersey in that late summer of 2001, I stopped by a house party in Washington D.C. that featured a local cover band. The band was <em>tight</em>. After the performance, I went up to the guitarist and told him so.</p><p>“Thank you,” he said, “so, what’s <em>your</em> story?”</p><p>“I am going up to Princeton to start grad school in computer science.” I replied, “I want to build the world’s most advanced automated music composition machine.”</p><p>The guitarist studied me for a moment and asked, succinct and earnest, “What’s the point?”</p><p>It was a good question. No, it was a great question; maybe <em>the</em> question. It stopped me in my tracks and I did not give an answer. I did not have an answer. “I’ll let you know if I figure that out.” I grinned, as I pocketed the question for future rumination.</p><p>That brief exchange would domino into a “personal crisis of faith”, one that I would relish, for it would challenge my beliefs and continually beckon me to reflect on the role of technology for things that, like Music, <em>really</em> matter to us.</p><p>Over the next six years of graduate school, I worked on computer music with seriously playful characters like professors Perry Cook and Dan Truemen and fellow grad student Rebecca Fiebrink. I never did attempt to build “the world’s most advanced algorithmic composition engine” — because I never could answer the question “what is the point?” (without resorting to hand-wavy and frankly bullshit answers like “democratize music-making”). Instead, I built a <em>tool</em>, a <a href="https://chuck.stanford.edu/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">domain-specific programming language for music</a>; thinking maybe I could create one more expressive tool with which people can make music and, if they wished, explore “what’s the point?” for themselves.</p><p>More than twenties years later, I am a tenured professor at a so-called “elite university” in the heart of Silicon Valley, ground zero of Big Tech. Meanwhile, my personal crisis of faith persists. I still ask, “what is the point?”. I still do not have an answer that satisfies, but I have come to profoundly appreciate the question, which I now help my students to ask in all that they do, especially in shaping technology. Ever the contrarian, I task my “Music and AI” students (many of them engineers) to build “useless things that are interesting to you” as a way to playfully work with technologies like AI, and to probe for both capacities and limits. They respond by by making things like<em> auto-rizz.ck</em>:</p><p><iframe width="853" height="505" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FYc6uXBUL6k?si=nKlo_6T8JExeY3aF" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><em>auto-rizz.ck</em> uses AI — not “generative” but interactive. It detects “seductive” glances and plays cheesy saxophone music (yes, that is all it does). It’s whimsical. It’s absurd. It fit the assignment brilliantly. I always ask students to ask themselves <em>why</em> they chose to build what they did. Matt, the inventor of auto-rizz.ck, had this to say (excerpted from <a href="https://mattreed-75933.medium.com/how-i-got-a-girlfriend-from-1-chuck-program-ee59d76c136a" rel="noopener">his reflection</a>):</p><p><em>“I really enjoyed this assignment. I think its easy to adopt this toxic capitalistic mindset that everything you do or make has to be productive or “for” something. But when we follow that dogma, we forget to make beautiful things just because they’re beautiful, do funny things just because they’re funny, or make stupid projects just because they’re stupid. There’s so much beauty in doing things just because. It was nice to take a pause on life and make something just for the sake of making it (and for a grade, but that’s more of an afterthought).” — Matt</em></p><p>I ask my students to look for interesting questions in everything. I tell them that the power of a good question is not in the answer, but in the question’s capacity to regeneratively invite more questions, and to construct lenses for examining the world — and ourselves. It’s like the question, asked by the ancient Greeks more than two millennia ago, “What is the <em>good life</em>?” We are still asking ourselves this today.</p><h2 id="3110"><strong>A Labor-creating Machine?</strong></h2><p>Ruminating on AI and art and the point of it all, I am reminded of a John Cage sentiment:</p><p><em>“What we need is a computer that isn’t labor-saving, but which increases the work for us to do.” — John Cage (from “Diary: Audience 1966”)</em></p><p>I first learned of this quote through CCRMA Ph.D. candidate Nick Shaheed’s Qualifying Exam. Nick’s interpretation of its meaning in a world nearly 60 years later:</p><div><p><em>“So, why would I want to increase the work I need to do? Well, because it’s fun and it’s work I want to do! For me (and many many other artists), doing the work and the work itself are largely the same thing. Speaking personally, my creative practice is about as far from the idealized depiction of Mozart shown in (the film) Amadeus, a fully formed concept is not being put onto the page as the first draft. Beginning with just the most basic seed of an idea, and then the process of trying it out, realizing it, tweaking things, all these bits of effort are the bricks being laid that form the actual piece itself. Without the work being done to make the music, the end result would be very different (and probably, worse).” — Nick Shaheed (from “CCRMA Quals Exam 2024”)</em></p><p>I resonate with Nick’s position — that the process not only shapes the outcome invariably, but constitutes an unalienable part of what the outcome is. It is the idea that art is to be <em>made,</em> for it is during the making that we realize what we are truly trying to say, far beyond the initial inkling of a concept. It is the observation that process brings its own intrinsic rewards, not despite of but <em>because of</em> the inherent challenges in making things for ourselves. This is all to say, process is not an obstacle to be removed on the path of creative expression. It <em>is</em> the path.</p></div><p>Any process of creation is simultaneously a process of learning, beset by setbacks, confusion, and frustration. Yet, such frictions can, if one sticks with the process, ultimately give rise to something fulfilling: a deeper understanding of how a thing works and how to work with it, accompanied by the feeling that we have learned a bit more about ourselves and what we are capable of achieving. Skipping the process makes about as much sense as “playing” a difficult video game by asking someone else (robot or human) to take the controller and play it in your place, while you verbally offer general prompts about what to do and where to go from the couch. That would still be an experience, maybe even an enjoyable one, but it would be a fundamentally different experience from undertaking the process for yourself.</p><p>Reflecting on these ideas only makes me sadder that voices such as Suno’s (who received another venture capital funding round of $125M late last year) continue to dominate and shape the public imagination on AI and creative expression, drowning out other voices that would also have something to say about what we truly want from this technology, and how we might want to live with it moving forward.</p><p>The technology is new, but what GenAI music companies like Suno are doing is not. Like the recording industry before them (and without whom, ironically, there would be no training data for GenAI), companies like Suno commodify creative expression as part of an aesthetic economy based on passive consumption. Thus it is in Suno’s core interest to usher people away from active creation, and toward a system of frictionless convenience that strives to lower the effort of production — and the effort of imagination beyond vague concepts to type into prompts — to <em>zero</em>. And while no doubt prompting-AI-systems will be a new kind of “muscle” for us all to build, one has to ask: what other muscles will atrophy? There is always a price to pay; the danger of living in a world of frictionless convenience might well be cultural and individual stagnation.</p><p>This brings us to the most misleading part of GenAI companies like Suno: they purport to be tools for creating art, but by making every effort to dismiss and eradicate the process of learning to expressive ourselves, what they are actually creating is a new generation of <em>consumers. </em>While these endeavors might make a few individuals a lot of money in the meantime, it is unlikely to be good in the long-run for culture — or our soul.</p><p>I am not philosophically in opposition to generative AI, even for artistic creation. For one, I don’t know what “AI making art” evens means at this point; I barely, if at all, understand “humans making art”. I am inclined to say, therefore, “there should be room for that, too”. At the same time, I am committed to preserving and protecting the room for humans to labor profusely, unenjoyably, illogically to creatively express themselves. The former may happen more and more as AI entrenches itself further in our lives; simultaneously, there is something at stake in the latter. “There should be room for that, too” should apply both ways.</p><p>I once gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYc6uXBUL6k&amp;ab_channel=MattReed">a talk at Stanford HAI’s conference on AI and Creativity</a>, where I put forth my own “crisis” question for others: “What Do We (Really) Want from Artificial Intelligence?”. The talk offers no answers, but a set of lenses to think about AI and creative expression. Give it a watch, if you would like, and figure out for yourself the questions that matter to you.</p><p><iframe width="853" height="505" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1tqgwlfi8P8?si=Pwtifp0v8jYVHFqh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 id="bb7c"><strong>What I (Really) Want</strong></h2><p>In these days of profound uncertainty about the future, I look at my daughter, who just turned one, and every fiber of my person tells me this: as she grows, I would want her to learn to value and even embrace the difficulty, confusion, frustration that come with learning, and that reside inherent in the craft of creatively expressing oneself, whatever form that may take — and for her to come to know the sublime joy hidden in the process…with or without AI.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							<p><span>As a lawyer who sues the government, you get used to the different kinds of arguments that government lawyers use to justify abuses of individual rights—sweeping claims of government power, bad-faith procedural obstacles, and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>This was a new one: The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) </span><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.255899/gov.uscourts.dcd.255899.18.0.pdf"><span>argued</span></a><span> that confiscating $50,000 from a small business did not infringe the business' right to private property because money is not property.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>"Money is not necessarily 'property' for constitutional purposes," the government's brief declared—putting the very idea of property in square quotes. Reading at my desk, I practically fell out of my chair.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The DOJ gave three rationales for the argument, all packed into a doorstopper of a footnote: (1) the government creates money, so you can't own it; (2) the government can tax your money, so you don't own it; and (3) the Constitution allows the government to spend money for the "general welfare."</span></p> <p><span>If a libertarian was asked to write a satire of a government lawyer's brief, this is what they might come up with. But here it was, in black and white.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Whose money, specifically, was the government saying wasn't property? That of Chuck Saine, the owner of C.S. Lawn &amp; Landscaping, a small landscaping business outside Annapolis, Maryland, which he has operated for over 40 years.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Saine became a client of the Institute for Justice (I.J.), a public interest law firm, when the federal government sought to </span><a href="https://ij.org/case/c-s-lawn-administrative-appeal/"><span>impose over $50,000 in liability</span></a><span> on his business through a "trial" held deep inside the bowls of a federal administrative agency. At said trial, both the prosecutor and the judge were employed by the same federal agency.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I.J. sued, arguing that before the government can impose that kind of liability, it has to provide a real trial before a real judge and jury. The specifics of what the government claims Saine did wrong (in short: arcane labor law) are beside the point. If the government wants to confiscate over $50,000 from your business, you must have the chance to argue your defense to an impartial judge and jury—not an agency bureaucrat.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Now, the DOJ argued that Saine has no right to a real judge and jury because the government was only trying to take his money, not his property. They claimed that fiat currency is a legal fiction that the government can as easily destroy as create. Lest anyone miss the implicit connection to the history of the gold standard, DOJ's footnote prominently cited the </span><i><span>Legal Tender Cases</span></i><span>—where the Supreme Court upheld laws forcing people to accept paper currency, rather than gold and silver, as payment for debts.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>This was an argument for taking Saine's $50,000 without a trial before a real judge and jury, but the same argument could be used to justify all manner of mischief. If your money is not your property, what is to stop the government from just seizing all of it tomorrow—for any reason it gives?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Before you run out and trade your USD for meme coins, let me reassure you: DOJ's argument is wrong. The Due Process Clause applies to "life, liberty, or property," and the Supreme Court has repeatedly applied that Clause to money. It follows that, since money is neither life nor liberty, it must be property.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>To be sure, DOJ's arguments have force as a philosophical critique of government, taxation, and the monetary system. They may also highlight legitimate reasons to hold part of your wealth in gold or (for some) cryptocurrency. But "for constitutional purposes," to borrow a phrase from the DOJ, the arguments are a flop.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>A federal court will soon decide whether to uphold Saine's right to a trial before an impartial judge and jury. Hopefully, the court will agree: Money is property, and an agency bureaucrat is not an impartial judge.</span></p>						</div></div>]]></description>

It is literally the original 6502 assembly source code, just heavily commented.</p>

						<p>As well as <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/cassette/articles/map_of_the_source_code.html">exploring the source</a>, you can read <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/deep_dives/">over 120 deep dives</a> into how Elite weaves its magic, <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/playing_elite/">play the game</a>, or take things to a new level with the <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/hacks/">Elite hacks</a>. There are more suggestions for your visit in the section below.</p>

						<p>All the official versions of 6502 Elite are covered (and more):</p>

						<ul>
						    <li>The original <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/cassette/">BBC Micro cassette</a> version</li>

						    <li>The enhanced <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/disc/">BBC Micro disc</a> version</li>

						    <li>The cut-down <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/electron/">Acorn Electron</a> version</li>

						    <li>The super-fast <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/6502sp/">6502 Second Processor</a> version</li>

						    <li>The musical <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/c64/">Commodore 64</a> version</li>

						    <li>The flicker-free <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/apple/">Apple II</a> version</li>

						    <li>The super-smooth <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/master/">BBC Master</a> version</li>

						    <li>The "impossible" <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/nes/">Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)</a> version</li>

						    <li>And Angus Duggan's <a href="https://elite.bbcelite.com/elite-a/">Elite-A</a>, the epic extended version of the original game</li>

						</ul>

						<p>Elite was first released in 1984, for the BBC Micro. It was written by Ian Bell and David Braben, and was published by Acornsoft (for Acorn machines), Firebird (Commodore 64 and Apple II) and Imagineer (for the NES). The original sources were released some time ago by Ian Bell on his <a href="http://www.elitehomepage.org/">personal website</a>.</p>

						<p><img src="https://elite.bbcelite.com/images/general/Elite-NES.png" alt="NES Elite screenshot"></p><p>Note that the source code has not been released for the BBC Micro disc, Acorn Electron or BBC Master versions, so where they differ from the released sources, the extra code has been reconstructed by hand from a disassembly of the original game binaries. The rest is all original 1980s source code.</p>

						<p>My hope is that this site will be useful for those who want to learn more about Elite and what makes it tick. It is provided on an educational and non-profit basis, with the aim of helping people appreciate one of the most iconic games of the 8-bit era.</p>

          <h2>What are Tensor Diagrams?</h2>
          <p>
            Machine learning involves a lot of tensor manipulation, and it's easy to lose track of the bigger picture when manipulating high-dimensional data using notation designed for vectors and matrices.
          </p>
          <p>
            It turns out all the trouble with tensors disappears when you instead represent them using graphs:
          </p>
          <p><img src="https://tensorcookbook.com/paper/figures/front.png" alt="Tensor Diagram Example">
          </p>
          <p>
            This book aims to <strong>standardize the notation for tensor diagrams</strong> by rewriting the classical
            "<a href="https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf">Matrix Cookbook</a>" using this notation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tensor diagrams are better than alternative notation like Index Notation (einsum) because they:
          </p>
          <ul>
             <li>Make it easy to spot patterns and symmetries</li>
             <li>Avoid all trouble with vectorization and Kronecker products</li>
             <li>Make Matrix Calculus simple and intuitive</li>
             <li>Represent functions and broadcasting effortlessly</li>

												<p>The FBI and authorities in The Netherlands this week seized dozens of servers and domains for a hugely popular spam and malware dissemination service operating out of Pakistan. The proprietors of the service, who use the collective nickname “<strong>The Manipulaters</strong>,” have been the subject of three stories published here since 2015. The FBI said the main clientele are organized crime groups that try to trick victim companies into making payments to a third party.</p>
<div id="attachment_56857"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-56857" decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ftexploit.png" alt="" width="749" height="530" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ftexploit.png 1208w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ftexploit-768x544.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ftexploit-782x553.png 782w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ftexploit-100x70.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-56857">One of several current Fudtools sites run by the principals of The Manipulators.</p></div>
<p>On January 29, the FBI and the Dutch national police seized the technical infrastructure for a cybercrime service marketed under the brands <strong>Heartsender</strong>, <strong>Fudpage</strong> and <strong>Fudtools</strong> (and many other “fud” variations). The “fud” bit stands for “Fully Un-Detectable,” and it refers to cybercrime resources that will evade detection by security tools like antivirus software or anti-spam appliances.</p>
<p>The Dutch authorities <a href="https://www.politie.nl/nieuws/2025/januari/27/09-verstoringsactie-deelt-klap-uit-aan-crimineel-cybernetwerk-heartsender.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> 39 servers and domains abroad were seized, and that the servers contained millions of records from victims worldwide — including at least 100,000 records pertaining to Dutch citizens.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdtx/pr/cybercrime-websites-selling-hacking-tools-transnational-organized-crime-groups-seized" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> from the <strong>U.S. Department of Justice</strong> refers to the cybercrime group as <strong>Saim Raza</strong>, after a pseudonym The Manipulaters communally used to promote their spam, malware and phishing services on social media.</p>
<p>“The Saim Raza-run websites operated as marketplaces that advertised and facilitated the sale of tools such as phishing kits, scam pages and email extractors often used to build and maintain fraud operations,” the DOJ explained.</p>
<p>The core Manipulaters product is <strong>Heartsender</strong>, a spam delivery service whose homepage openly advertised phishing kits targeting users of various Internet companies, including <strong>Microsoft 365</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Yahoo</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>AOL</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Intuit</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>iCloud</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>ID.me</strong>, to name a few.</p>
<p>The government says transnational organized crime groups that purchased these services primarily used them to run <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/business-email-compromise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business email compromise</a> (BEC) schemes, wherein the cybercrime actors tricked victim companies into making payments to a third party.</p>
<p>“Those payments would instead be redirected to a financial account the perpetrators controlled, resulting in significant losses to victims,” the DOJ wrote. “These tools were also used to acquire victim user credentials and utilize those credentials to further these fraudulent schemes. The seizure of these domains is intended to disrupt the ongoing activity of these groups and stop the proliferation of these tools within the cybercriminal community.”</p>

<p>KrebsOnSecurity first wrote about The Manipulaters <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/05/phishing-gang-is-audacious-manipulator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in May 2015</a>, mainly because their ads at the time were blanketing a number of popular cybercrime forums, and because they were fairly open and brazen about what they were doing — even who they were in real life.</p>
<p>We caught up with The Manipulaters again in 2021, with <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/09/fudco-spam-empire-tied-to-pakistani-software-firm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a story</a> that found the core employees had started a web coding company in Lahore called <strong>WeCodeSolutions</strong> — presumably as a way to account for their considerable Heartsender income. That piece examined how WeCodeSolutions employees had all doxed themselves on Facebook by posting pictures from company parties each year featuring a large cake with the words <strong>FudCo</strong> written in icing.<span id="more-70250"></span></p>
<p>A <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/04/the-manipulaters-improve-phishing-still-fail-at-opsec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">follow-up story last year</a> about The Manipulaters prompted messages from various WeCodeSolutions employees who pleaded with this publication to remove stories about them. The Saim Raza identity told KrebsOnSecurity they were recently released from jail after being arrested and charged by local police, although they declined to elaborate on the charges.</p>
<p>The Manipulaters never seemed to care much about protecting their own identities, so it’s not surprising that they were unable or unwilling to protect their own customers. In <a href="https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/the-resurgence-of-the-manipulaters-team-breaking-heartsenders?utm_source=Krebs-on-Security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an analysis</a> released last year, <strong>DomainTools.com</strong> found the web-hosted version of Heartsender leaked an extraordinary amount of user information to unauthenticated users, including customer credentials and email records from Heartsender employees.</p>
<div id="attachment_56860"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-56860" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fudcocake.png" alt="" width="751" height="773" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fudcocake.png 834w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fudcocake-768x790.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fudcocake-782x805.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-56860">Almost every year since their founding, The Manipulaters have posted a picture of a FudCo cake from a company party celebrating its anniversary.</p></div>
<p>DomainTools also uncovered evidence that the computers used by The Manipulaters were all infected with the same password-stealing malware, and that vast numbers of credentials were stolen from the group and sold online.</p>
<p>“Ironically, the Manipulaters may create more short-term risk to their own customers than law enforcement,” DomainTools wrote. “The data table ‘User Feedbacks’ (sic) exposes what appear to be customer authentication tokens, user identifiers, and even a customer support request that exposes root-level SMTP credentials–all visible by an unauthenticated user on a Manipulaters-controlled domain.”</p>
<p>Police in The Netherlands said the investigation into the owners and customers of the service is ongoing.</p>
<p>“The Cybercrime Team is on the trail of a number of buyers of the tools,” the Dutch national police said. “Presumably, these buyers also include Dutch nationals. The investigation into the makers and buyers of this phishing software has not yet been completed with the seizure of the servers and domains.”</p>
<p>U.S. authorities this week also joined law enforcement in Australia, France, Greece, Italy, Romania and Spain in seizing a number of domains for several long-running cybercrime forums and services, including <strong>Cracked</strong> and <strong>Nulled</strong>. According to <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/law-enforcement-takes-down-two-largest-cybercrime-forums-in-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement</a> from the European police agency <strong>Europol</strong>, the two communities attracted more than 10 million users in total.</p>
<p>Other domains seized as part of “<strong>Operation Talent</strong>” included <strong>Sellix</strong>, an e-commerce platform that was frequently used by cybercrime forum members to buy and sell illicit goods and services.</p>

</figure>

<p>I used to have boring health. I never had more than the flu, been admitted to the hospital, and I could eat whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. In late 2023, that changed when I developed chronic nausea.</p>
<p>The nausea started on November 20, 2023, with what I thought was nothing more than a mild upset stomach and has continued every day since, with varying intensity without any clear triggers. I’ve seen a dozen doctors, tried many medications, and have been subjected to more tests than before I became ill. Nothing pointed to a clear cause and no treatment has had lasting effects.</p>
<p>Chronic nausea is invisible and debilitating.<br>I’m learning how to be me again.</p>
<p>I never gave much thought to what I ate. I ate when I was hungry, enjoyed going to work, lost myself in my projects, and visited family regularly, eating out often on trips. Now, I carefully monitor everything I eat and have up to seven small meals a day. I’m only able to eat small amounts of food at a time because I feel extremely full if I have anything resembling a complete meal. <strong>I’ve learned to eat <em>through</em> the nausea.</strong> I rely on foods that are easy to digest and eat roughly every two hours so I can get enough nutrients to maintain a constant weight. I used to travel every year to visit family but have had to cancel more than a year’s worth of trips because there have been many times when I could barely leave my house to run errands, let alone fly to another state. I take frequent naps, not because I’m tired, but because they allow me to escape the awareness of how I feel. My life revolves around how poorly I’m feeling and it’s hard to focus on much else.</p>
<p>My doctors initially diagnosed me with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gastroparesis/symptoms-causes/syc-20355787">gastroparesis</a>, which means food didn’t pass through my stomach as fast as it should, and as a result, ferments and causes nausea. Later, that diagnosis was broadened to include <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/functional-dyspepsia/symptoms-causes/syc-20375709">functional dyspepsia</a> and <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22997-visceral-hypersensitivity">visceral hypersensitivity</a>—both of which are vague umbrella terms that essentially mean I have an upset stomach with no clear cause and no cure.</p>
<p>When I realized the nausea was becoming chronic, I started doing one thing I could control—<strong>collect data about it</strong>. At the end of each day, I took up writing basic notes about how I felt that day, any treatments I tried, and assigning a number to it from 0 to 10 based on how nauseous I felt.</p>

<figure>
    
    <figcaption>Timeline of daily nausea severity with running average</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <ol start="0">
        <li>No nausea all day</li>
        <li>Occasional periods with little or no nausea</li>
        <li>Noticeable but manageable nausea all day</li>
        <li>Steady nausea all day with difficulty focusing, one or two naps needed</li>
        <li>Unavoidable nausea with multiple naps needed for relief</li>
        <li>Constant strong nausea all day, multiple naps needed</li>
        <li>Strong nausea all day and schedule changes needed for relief</li>
        <li>Vomiting at least once, hospital visit optional</li>
        <li>Unable to keep food down, hospital visit needed</li>
        <li>Vomiting, pain, hospital visit</li>
        <li>Prolonged hospital visit</li>
    </ol>
</figure>

<p>Originally, I tracked this to help my doctors better understand how I was feeling and create new treatment plans but that never happened, despite mentioning it to every doctor I’ve seen. Instead, I use it as a point of reference to remind myself what I’ve tried and to identify trends.</p>
<p>What I’ve found most interesting is the regular intervals at which my nausea flares up—about two weeks. This was surprising because I didn’t expect there to be such regularity. I’ve learned to consider this pattern when evaluating a treatment’s effectiveness. If a treatment had a meaningful impact beyond two weeks, it would be considered effective. Unfortunately, few have.</p>
<p>I’ve seen a range of doctors over dozens of visits in an effort to find relief, including my regular doctor, gastroenterologists, surgeons, therapists, a dietician, and a neurologist. The conversations I’ve had have typically been less than an hour long and comprised me giving a too-brief summary on how I’ve been feeling, reviewing tests results, some general questions about any changes in my habits, and a suggestion to try anti-anxiety medication, over-the-counter medication, or continue waiting to see if my symptoms improve on their own.</p>

<figure>
    
    <figcaption>Timeline of doctor visits</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>From November 2023 to May 2024, I saw my gastroenterologist, psychologist, and dietician on a regular basis. By summer, I started to feel better—even without medication—so appointments were scaled back. The nausea never completely subsided but felt manageable. However, it increased substantially toward the end of June, which prompted me to consider seeing other doctors to help me cope. I met with a neurologist, who was kind enough to listen to my story from beginning to end over the course of two hours. The outcome was similar but I was glad I had the chance to tell him my full story. I started seeing a psychiatrist to see if off-label use of psychiatric medication would help but as of this writing, I’m still evaluating its effectiveness.</p>
<p>Appointments have been emotional roller coasters. Before each one, I naively started to hope that a recent test or experience with medication would reveal something new, or my doctor would have a new treatment to try. Often, the outcome is hearing that everything “looks normal” or that my problems are due to anxiety, which are two of the most crushing responses to hear, especially when I feel far from normal. Weeks or months have often separated appointments, partly because of availability, but also because trying new treatments takes time. Waiting months to see doctors or try treatments only to be told the same result after a short 30-minute visit is a constant source of frustration.</p>
<p>None of my doctors could identify a clear cause for the ongoing nausea but two key events may have contributed:</p>

<ul>
    <li>On September 19, 2023, I tested positive for <strong>COVID-19</strong>. Having been vaccinated, it seemed to be a mild case with common symptoms—such as congestion, loss of smell, loss of taste, and of course, nausea. Unusual symptoms included vertigo and a numb toe. After 12 days, I felt normal again and had no lasting ill effects.</li>
    <li>On November 2, 2023, I caught the <strong>stomach flu</strong> and felt nauseous during the last day of a vacation in Florida and collapsed after standing up too quickly, hitting my head on the way down. I’ve always been somewhat prone to vasovagal syncope but only succumbed to it a handful of times. After coming to in less than a minute, I vomited and had a panic attack. The nausea subsided a few days later with no lasting ill effects. Doctors suspected it was little more than a stomach bug.</li>
</ul>

<p>These two events were far enough away from my initial onset of chronic nausea that none of my doctors could definitively say if either was the cause of my nausea but believe they may have damaged some of my gastrointestinal nerves. Unfortunately, knowing a potential cause doesn’t necessarily result in an effective treatment.</p>
<p>Procedures I’ve had include numerous blood draws, CT scans, gastric emptying studies (GES), ultrasounds, and a failed pharmaceutical clinical trial. Early on, a lot of the standard tests were performed to rule out obvious causes like obstructions, cancer, etc.</p>

<figure>
    
    <figcaption>Timeline of tests and procedures</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The only test that showed something conclusive was my first gastric emptying study. Out of all the tests I’ve had, it was the most pleasant because it simply involved eating some scrambled eggs laced with a harmless radioactive tracer along with a piece of toast and taking scans of my abdomen over the course of four hours to see how the food moved through my system. After four hours, I should have had 10% or less in my stomach but in December 2023, I had 41% remaining, which indicated gastroparesis. Based on that, I was prescribed a few medications to make my gastrointestinal muscles work more efficiently but none had a lasting effect. The second study I had in September 2024 showed 8% remaining, at which point my gastroparesis was considered resolved but my symptoms persisted.</p>

<p>There was some concern early on that I may have <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/median-arcuate-ligament-syndrome-mals/symptoms-causes/syc-20505001">median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS)</a> because one of my arteries appeared more compressed than expected in an ultrasound but that was ruled out after a follow-up ultrasound and a consultation with a vascular surgeon, who didn’t feel there was cause for concern.</p>
<p>ER visits bookended 2024—one in January for excess stomach acid caused by stopping an acid-blocking medication and again in November for a suspected small bowel obstruction, later thought to be enteritis. The latter required staying in the hospital for four days with an NG tube in my nose to drain my stomach (not a fun experience). My nausea subsided while the tube was in place but came back a couple days after being discharged. Despite the circumstances, the lack of nausea was a welcomed, albeit brief relief. During my hospital stay, my many tests were punctuated by panic attacks. Prior to becoming sick, I hadn’t had a panic attack but quickly learned what they feel like so I know what to expect in the future if I feel one coming on. The hospital staff were angels that provided immeasurable help throughout my stay in the hospital and I will be forever grateful for them.</p>
<p>I’ve tried numerous over-the-counter and prescription-strength medications since my nausea started with varying levels of success. Few medications had an immediate effect, so I often had to wait weeks to determine if they helped and they often came with side effects.</p>

<p>The earliest medications I tried were over-the-counter like <strong>Dramamine</strong> and <strong>FDgard</strong> but they did little to help and thankfully had no side effects. When those didn’t work, <strong>Zofran</strong> (often prescribed to cancer patients going through chemotherapy) was prescribed but only lasted a short while. Zofran did cause constipation so more medication was needed to keep that at bay.</p>
<p>Acid-reducing medication like <strong>omeprazole</strong> and <strong>pantoprazole</strong> were prescribed, thinking that my nausea was due to excess stomach acid, but they didn’t touch the nausea. I learned the hard way that stopping pantoprazole suddenly is not recommended because doing so caused excess acid and my first trip to the ER.</p>
<p>To help with motility, or the movement of food through the digestive tract, I tried <strong>Reglan</strong> for about two months. It had no positive impact on my nausea but did cause strong hunger pangs before meals, which implies it had some positive effect on motility. My muscles also started twitching occasionally, which could have been signs of early <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/6125-tardive-dyskinesia">tardive dyskinesia</a> (a common side effect). It can also become chronic and incurable if left untreated so once the twitching started, I discontinued it.</p>
<p><strong>Erythromycin</strong> was prescribed toward the end of February and was the first medication with a noticeable positive effect and may have contributed to why I was able to spend about two months after my regimen without medication. It’s primary use is as an antibiotic but is used off-label to treat delayed gastric emptying (gastroparesis) and nausea in lower doses. The only negative side effect was a strong sense of hunger before meals. When my nausea started to increase at the end of June, I was prescribed a second round but it wasn’t as effective—a common experience for those taking it long term.</p>
<p>In August 2024, I learned of a clinical trial for <strong>Tradipitant</strong>—a new drug that was supposed to help reduce nausea in gastroparesis patients. I had to go through a screening period but made it into the trial and took it regularly for two months. Ultimately, the medication didn’t have any positive impact on my nausea but also didn’t cause negative side effects. While it was a lot of time to spend on an experimental treatment that didn’t pan out, I’m glad I did it. Otherwise, I would have forever wondered if it could have helped me.</p>
<p>Since September 2024, I’ve also been on increasing dosages of <strong>mirtazapine</strong> for depression and an off-label use of reducing nausea as well as Pepcid AC to keep stomach acid at bay. The side effects have been minimal and manageable. Since December 2024, I’ve also been trying <strong>Marinol</strong>—a synthetic form of cannabis to help with nausea, appetite, and fullness. As of this writing, it’s too soon to tell if it’s working but there haven’t been any noticeable negative side effects.</p>
<p>Two over-the-counter medications have proven to be surprisingly effective: <strong>ginger and pectin lozenges</strong>. When my chronic nausea began, I wrote off ginger because I had tried Dramamine ginger chews with no success. Toward the end of December 2023, I bought several kinds of lozenges to give them another try and was pleasantly surprised to find that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BQKKV8JC">UpSpring Stomach Settles ginger lozenges</a> helped when my nausea was mild and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breezers-Creamy-Strawberry-Throat-Economy/dp/B07MNKZDK2">Halls Throat Soothing drops</a> helped when I was feeling the effects of excess acid. Both helped within minutes and even though they only lasted a short while (hours at most), having them available has been a big help physically and mentally. Both are available on Amazon and Walgreens.</p>
<p>Throughout this ordeal, my weight has also been a constant focus. I’ve tracked my daily weight since August 2022 purely out of curiosity after seeing how others have tracked their weight and shared how it was affected by diets, medical conditions, life events, etc. I found it interesting to see how my weight fluctuated based on diet, exercise, travel, and even sleep. In an effort to keep it accurate, I developed the habit of weighing myself first thing in the morning and last thing at night and tracking the data using the Health app on iOS. This highlighted a problem that I was unaware of when my chronic nausea first started: <strong>I stopped eating enough</strong>.</p>

<p>When I was nauseous, the last thing I wanted to do was eat so I simply ate less in a futile effort to keep it at bay. As a result, I started shedding pounds and not in a healthy way. Looking back to before I caught COVID, my weight hovered just below 170 lbs and my height was 5′9″. I lost some weight during COVID then it fell off sharply once the chronic nausea started. At my lowest in March, I weighed about 146 lbs. I struggled a great deal to find foods with enough calories and nutrients to maintain a healthy weight. My sessions with my dietician helped me figure out what I could eat and get me back on track. Over the next several months, I slowly inched back up to about 161 lbs. by June. Unfortunately, the increasing nausea around that time and subsequent hospital stay in November resulted in more weight loss, but I am slowly doing my best to gain it back.</p>
<p>A few of my doctors have recommended that I stop tracking all this data to improve my mental health and stop focusing on how I feel. While I understand why, I continue because I won’t be able to remember everything and I still hold out hope of finding meaningful information in all the noise. If nothing else, my experiences may prove useful for others going through similar situations. For better or worse, it’s become a cornerstone of my illness.</p>
<p>The hardest thing to come to terms with is that I likely won’t get better. There’s always the chance that my chronic nausea could go away on its own but that uncertainty is daunting. My family and friends have been invaluable in helping me through this long chaos. I love them more than they could ever know. There are more options I can try and I intend to try everything I can until I find something that works.</p>
<p>I will do everything I can to make my health boring again.</p>
