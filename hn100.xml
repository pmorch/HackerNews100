<p>Borland’s <em>Turbo Pascal</em> was one of the most successful programming tools of all time. It introduced development techniques, such as integrated source-level debugging, that we take for granted today; but which were radical at the time.</p>
<p>TP 7, also known as <em>Turbo Pascal for Windows 1.5</em>, was the pinnacle of the Turbo Pascal line, and its end. The name ‘Turbo’ was associated with what were regarded as hobbyist products – ‘Borland Pascal’ was a different, much more expensive, product. But Turbo Pascal was enough for some quite substantial applications, and was very affordable. It was also ‘book licensed’, which I think was a new thing in the software industry. You could buy one copy of TP, and any number of people could use it – but only one at a time. Even when it was distributed on floppy disks, there was no copy protection. (Turbo) Pascal eventually gave way to Delphi which, despite its technical merits, never had the same impact.</p>
<p>I used TP 7 to write medical imaging software back in the 90s, to run under Windows 3.1 – which was a great operating system in its day. Like previous releases, Windows 3.1 was still, essentially, an extension to MSDOS, but with clever tricks to allow it to multitask (after a fashion) and address more memory. It had a simple, consistent user interface model – both for the user and the programmer. It had, at that time, none of the wasteful and irritating anti-features that have come to make modern Windows so depressing to use. So Windows 3.1 was a platform we all wanted our applications to support – not that there were many alternatives at that time.</p>
<p>Like many other programmers, I learned the Pascal programming language specifically to use TP 7 – I was essentially a C programmer in those days, but programming for Windows in C was a horrible job. Frankly, it’s scarcely better today. It was, and is, necessary to combine a whole stack of command-line tools that take incomprehensible text files as input. TP 7 automated and concealed all that nastiness.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the tools that were a problem: the user interface model was, essentially, object-oriented; but C did not make it easy to program in an object-oriented way. TP 5 had introduced basic object-oriented concepts to the Pascal language, and these were were to prove essential. The Windows-specific features were provided by something called <em>Object Windows Library</em>: a relatively thick, object-oriented wrapper around the basic Windows C API. My recollection is that Borland introduced an object-oriented programming library for Microsoft Windows before Microsoft did – and Borland’s was better.</p>

<p>OWL made it easy to create nice-looking user interfaces, with a bit of eye candy. The familiar ‘green tick button’ was an OWL enhancement, which graced so many Windows applications that it eventually became an irritating cliche.</p>
<p>All, in all, It was <em>much</em> easier to program for Windows using Turbo Pascal 7 than with anything else. Not only did it provide a programming model that matched the way the Windows user interface worked, the application itself had a Windows graphical interface – many Windows programming tools at that time actually ran under MSDOS, and were entirely text-based. TP 7 also had fully-graphical tools for designing the user interface elements, like menus and icons. Laying out a menu using a definition file with an obscure format, using Windows Notepad, was never an agreeable experience. Microsoft did produce graphical tools for this kind of operation, but Turbo Pascal combined them into a seamless IDE. All I had to do to build and run my programs was to hit the F7 key. I could even set breakpoints for the debugger, just by clicking a line of code. As I said, common enough today, but revolutionary for early Windows programming.</p>
<p>But what really made TP 7 special was its CP/M heritage. Turbo Pascal came to Windows by way of CP/M and MSDOS, which meant it had a compiler core that was designed to run with tight memory and a comparatively slow CPU. In the days when most compilers had to write a stack of intermediate files on disk, TP just constructed everything in memory. It did this using highly-optimized code, written in assembly language, by very skilled people. It doesn’t matter much today if your compiler spits out a heap of temporary files, because disk storage is fast and cheap. But in the days of the floppy disk, you had to minimize disk access. Unfortunately, you <em>also</em> had to minimize memory use, because there wasn’t much of that, either. Programming for CP/M took real skill and dedication.</p>
<p>So when TP came to Windows machines, with their 16-bit CPUs and megabytes of RAM, it was like an early Christmas for developers. A compiler designed to be adequate with 32kB of RAM and a single floppy drive will positively fly when given megabytes and a hard disk.</p>
<p>All this meant that TP 7 was a joy to use. It was like a modern IDE, but without any of the bloat. Developers who would never have tackled Windows programming with Microsoft tools were able to move from MSDOS to Windows without too much difficulty – even if they first had to learn Pascal, as I did. The compiled code was pretty speedy but, if it wasn’t brisk enough, you could write assembly language directly in the Pascal source files.</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s too much of an exaggeration to claim that Turbo Pascal contributed to the widespread uptake, and eventual domination, of Microsoft Windows on desktop PCs. If there had been a ‘Turbo Pascal for Linux’ in the early 90s, then we might <em>all</em> be running Linux on our desktops today.</p>
<p>So what happened to Turbo Pascal? Three things, at least, contributed to its eventual downfall.</p>
<p>First, there was increasing competition from the C programming language. Borland did produce a Turbo C, and later a Turbo C++, but they weren’t as influential as Pascal. It’s easy to forget that PCs weren’t the first general-purpose computing devices. Most scientific and educational establishments, and many businesses, used graphical workstations and a central minicomputer. C was already well-established in these environments before desktop computers started to become prominent. And before that we had mainframes and terminals – but that was a different world, where Fortran and COBOL ruled.</p>
<p>Most ‘serious’ PC applications were written in assembly language in the early days, as they had been for CP/M – the low resources almost necessitated this. Minicomputers were not so limited, so compilers were more practicable, even in the 1980s. So when compilers started to become of interest to microcomputer developers, there was almost no reason to favour one programming language over another. Pascal <em>could</em> have become the standard programming language for the PC. That it did not, I think, reflects the fact that many software companies that had been active in industrial and scientific computing saw an opportunity in PCs, and tried to move into that market. These companies already had substantial experience with C, and they brought their preferences with them. So while I was happy to learn a new programming language to develop for Windows, a software business with a thousand staff might not have wanted to take that step.</p>
<p>The second factor, I think, was the increasing palatability of Microsoft’s C tools. Microsoft did eventually produce an IDE of its own and, of course, Microsoft controlled the Windows platform. I don’t think Microsoft’s C IDEs <em>ever</em> became as easy to use as Borland’s, but they probably didn’t have to, given Microsoft’s position.</p>
<p>Third, Microsoft’s Visual BASIC started to attact small-scale and bespoke developers. BASIC was already a staple of the microcomputing world, because it was easy to learn, and did not require a separate compilation step. Attaching bits of BASIC code to Windows user interface elements was an efficient way to produce relatively simple, small-volume applications.</p>
<p>I loathed Visual BASIC in the 90s, and I loathed it until the day VB6 drew its last laboured, wheezing breath in 2005. Still, I can’t deny its popularity, and I’m sure that many of the same people who were drawn to Turbo Pascal were later drawn to Visual BASIC, for much the same reasons. VB lowered the barriers to entry into Windows programming in the same way that TP had previously done. Arguably it lowered them too much, but let’s not go there today.</p>
<p>Early versions of Turbo Pascal are now freely, and legally, available. Retrocomputing enthusiasts with an interest in early PCs and MSDOS are well catered for. So far as I know, however, TP 7 remains somebody’s intellectual property, although it isn’t entirely clear whose. It probably comes into the category of ‘abandonware’ but, to be frank, it’s not all that important: it can’t produce code that runs on modern Windows systems, and few people have much interest in early Windows – it’s just not retro enough.</p>
<p>So that’s Turbo Pascal: a colossus of the microcomputing world, which faded and died largely unlamented. It always was a creature of its time – it prospered for the brief period when microcomputers were limited enough to reward skilled development, but widespread enough to create a substantial market for programmers. By the time it started to become difficult to find enough highly-skilled programmers to satisfy the market needs, it didn’t matter: computers were getting powerful enough to make good our limitations as programmers. That almost nobody has the skills these days to implement something like TP is something we could eventually come to regret – or, rather, our grandchildren could. Software development is becoming a semi-skilled industry, and I doubt that the rise of AI will entirely compensate for this.</p>
<p>But who needs a Turbo Pascal, when you have 128Gb of RAM attached to an 5GHz CPU, for a hastily-written, bloated Java program to burn?</p>

        <h3>Helena<br><small>Happy Web Developer</small></h3>
        <p><span>Hot Page is the greatest invention since Flexbox.
            It lets me focus on the fun parts of building pages without the
            annoyance of deploying and hosting code. My clients can even use it
            to go in and work on their sites without my help</span></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Carlos<br><small>Happy Designer</small></h3>
        <p><span>Hot Page is a designer’s dream. I built a 12-column
            responsive layout from scratch and I never needed to pay a developer
            or cajole them to actually follow my spec</span></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>David<br><small>Happy Marketer</small></h3>
        <p><span>I have already built a dozen microsites for my
            campaigns for Chewems Spicy Cashews using Hot Page. I usually have a
            specific design in mind when I start building and I don’t want to
            compromise on it. On Hot Page I can just fire up the editor and have
            full control over the page — I will never go back to Brand X!</span>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Laura<br><small>Happy Poet</small></h3>
        <p><span>Hot Page is the perfect place to share my poems
            with the world. Every poem has it’s own unique layout and I can have
            full control over how it’s displayed on every device. There is no
            better way to build an artful page than on Hot Page.</span></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Jason<br><small>Happy Enthusiast </small></h3>
        <p><span>I used my high school HTML to turn all my favorite
            recipes into web pages that I can easily share with friends. Hot
            Page is so much better than putting them on Facebook because I can
            chose exactly how I want to present them. I finally have control
            over my stuff again.</span></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Mario<br><small>Happy Pizza Maker</small></h3>
        <p><span>The menu my team built on Hot Page looks fantastic
            and I can easily update it whenever we change our famous pies. Our
            menu pages load as fast as our wood-fired brick oven. </span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Bill Ackman and Sean “Diddy” Combs are among the list of owners of Elon Musk’s <a href="https://fortune.com/company/twitter/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/twitter/">X</a>, the social media site <a href="https://fortune.com/europe/2024/08/14/x-ordered-to-pay-550000-to-irish-employee-fired-for-not-replying-to-elon-musk-yes-or-resign-extremely-hardcore-ultimatum/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/europe/2024/08/14/x-ordered-to-pay-550000-to-irish-employee-fired-for-not-replying-to-elon-musk-yes-or-resign-extremely-hardcore-ultimatum/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks">formerly known as Twitter</a>.</p><div>



<p>The platform has been <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/08/21/elon-musk-x-twitter-must-disclose-full-ownership-structure-judge-rules/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/08/21/elon-musk-x-twitter-must-disclose-full-ownership-structure-judge-rules/">forced to disclose its investors</a> as <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/08/20/elon-musk-litigation-lawsuits-x-spacex-tesla-legal-federal-court/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/08/20/elon-musk-litigation-lawsuits-x-spacex-tesla-legal-federal-court/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks">part of a lawsuit brought by former employees</a>, who are seeking payment of arbitration fees incurred following <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/08/15/elon-musk-tesla-stock-sale-twitter-x-advertiser-boycott-finances-bradford-ferguson/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/08/15/elon-musk-tesla-stock-sale-twitter-x-advertiser-boycott-finances-bradford-ferguson/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks">Musk’s purchase of the site</a>. </p>



<p>Previously, X has argued that its investors were confidential as a matter of “routine practice and policy,” but this week, a federal judge in California ruled to unseal the list of the site’s owners.</p>



<p>Among the nearly 100 owners of the social media giant are some familiar names, both from the world of investment and within the X universe.</p>



<p>Previously, <span>high-profile investors like Fidelity have been connected with X, most notably because&nbsp;<a href="https://fortune.com/2024/01/02/elon-musk-twitter-value-72-percent-drop-fidelity/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/01/02/elon-musk-twitter-value-72-percent-drop-fidelity/" rel="noopener">the investment vehicle’s filings implied a 72% drop in the company’s value</a></span> since Musk took it over.</p>



<p>However, the latest filing reveals the investment behemoth’s backing of the platform, with almost 30 separate Fidelity-linked entities holding stakes in the brand.</p>



<p>This week’s unsealed documents also lay bare the lesser-known stakeholders in the company. </p>



<p><span>The list seen by&nbsp;<em>Fortune</em>&nbsp;reveals the Pershing Square Foundation owns a stake in X. </span>If the name sounds familiar, that’s because of its link to&nbsp;Pershing Square Holdings, founded by billionaire investor Bill Ackman 20 years ago.</p>



<p><span>Although the foundation of the same name is led by an independent senior leadership team, Ackman and his wife, Neri Oxman,&nbsp;<a href="https://pershingsquarefoundation.org/about-us/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://pershingsquarefoundation.org/about-us/" rel="noopener">are</a></span><a href="https://pershingsquarefoundation.org/about-us/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://pershingsquarefoundation.org/about-us/" rel="noopener"> co-trustees</a>.</p>



<p>Ackman is a vocal user of X and frequently uses the platform to address other <span>high-profile individuals and entities. He has used it to&nbsp;<a href="https://fortune.com/2024/01/05/mark-cuban-elon-musk-bill-ackman-tesla-twitter-dei-mavericks/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/01/05/mark-cuban-elon-musk-bill-ackman-tesla-twitter-dei-mavericks/" rel="noopener">debate <em>Shark Tank</em> star Mark Cuban</a>&nbsp;and raise<a href="https://fortune.com/2023/10/11/bill-ackman-larry-summers-harvard-critics-student-israel-statement-palestine-solidarity-committee-psc/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/10/11/bill-ackman-larry-summers-harvard-critics-student-israel-statement-palestine-solidarity-committee-psc/" rel="noopener">&nbsp;questions about the leadership of his alma mater, Harvard University</a></span>.</p>



<p>Elsewhere on the list of owners is <a href="https://fortune.com/company/oracle/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/oracle/">Oracle</a> founder Larry Ellison. <span>The stake in X comes via the Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust, the principal business of which, per an SEC report filed in 2008 and seen by&nbsp;<em>Fortune</em>, is to “hold the assets and estate of Mr. Ellison.”</span></p>



<p>The interests of the trust and Oracle bear no relation to each other, the SEC filing adds. </p>



<p>Unlike Ackman, Ellison is not an avid user of the site. Despite having more than 130,000 followers, Ellison has posted twice—once in 2012 and once in 2023.</p>



<p>Another notable name on the list is Sean Combs Capital. </p>



<p>While SEC filings show no matches for the company, the business has previously been linked to the American rapper Diddy—previously known as Puff Daddy—who has launched a number of businesses under his birth name.</p>



<p>These have included the Sean Combs Foundation, Combs Investments, and more recently the umbrella brand for his holdings, Combs Global.</p>



<p>Musk has also managed to attract some royal attention for his endeavor, with HRH Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Alsaud also featured on the list. </p>



<p>The Saudi prince has a net worth just shy of $19 billion, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/prince-alwaleed-bin-talal-alsaud/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.forbes.com/profile/prince-alwaleed-bin-talal-alsaud/" rel="noopener">per </a><em><a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/prince-alwaleed-bin-talal-alsaud/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.forbes.com/profile/prince-alwaleed-bin-talal-alsaud/" rel="noopener">Forbes</a>,</em> and also has holdings in the likes of luxury hotels the Four Seasons and the Savoy, as well as other technology firms like ride-sharing company <a href="https://fortune.com/company/lyft/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/lyft/">Lyft</a>.</p>



<p>It also seems that despite his criticism of Musk’s leadership, Jack Dorsey still owns shares in the platform he founded via the Jack Dorsey Remainder LLC.</p>



<p>The Twitter cofounder previously backed the <a href="https://fortune.com/company/tesla/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/tesla/">Tesla</a> CEO in his takeover of the company but <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/04/29/elon-musk-twitter-jack-dorsey-criticism/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/04/29/elon-musk-twitter-jack-dorsey-criticism/">walked </a><span><a href="https://fortune.com/2023/04/29/elon-musk-twitter-jack-dorsey-criticism/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/04/29/elon-musk-twitter-jack-dorsey-criticism/" rel="noopener">back his support earlier this year</a>, telling a member on rival social media platform Bluesky, “It</span> all went south.”</p>



<h2>Doubling down on investments</h2>



<p>Among the less eminent names are some organizations that not only hold stakes in X as a business but have also seen senior leaders pitch in.</p>



<p>Take the likes of Danilo Kawasaki and Ross Gerber. </p>



<p>According to the filing, the pair are named as individual investors in X but also have a stake in the business they lead, the wealth and investment management firm Gerber Kawasaki.</p>



<p>Elsewhere on the list are the Silicon Valley VCs one might expect: 8VC, Andreessen Horowitz, and Sequoia.</p>



<p>The list, of course, also features Musk himself. Via the Elon Musk Revocable Trust, the <a href="https://fortune.com/company/spacex/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/spacex/">SpaceX</a> founder is also listed.</p>



<p>Musk purchased the site for $44 billion in 2022, though the <span>filing did not make clear the proportion of his investment versus that of others. Since then, the business has been&nbsp;<a href="https://fortune.com/2024/08/06/elon-musk-declares-war-on-advertisers-lawsuit-x-boycott/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/08/06/elon-musk-declares-war-on-advertisers-lawsuit-x-boycott/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" rel="noopener">beleaguered by departing advertisers</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://fortune.com/2022/11/07/elon-musk-learn-stripe-layoffs-twitter-patrick-collison/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=advanced_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2022/11/07/elon-musk-learn-stripe-layoffs-twitter-patrick-collison/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=advanced_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" rel="noopener">mass layoffs,</a></span> and <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/11/30/elon-musk-x-linda-yaccarino-twitter-advertisers-free-speech-dealbook/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/11/30/elon-musk-x-linda-yaccarino-twitter-advertisers-free-speech-dealbook/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks">criticism of Musk’s strategy.</a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>This is a long post telling my experiences. Sorry for the length, couldn't make it any shorter.</em></p>

<p>Hello everybody. My name is Ed and I'm the developer of <a href="https://edgrace.itch.io/idletale">IdleTale</a>.</p>

<p>I started this project because I love incremental and RPG games, and I wanted to create something that I would really love to play myself, and idle RPGs are not something too common. So I did it out of pure passion.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/incremental_games/comments/1dedf6k/incremental_rpg_game_im_working_on/">made this first post</a> a few months ago when the game was just an idea. It received so much support that I decided to keep going and turn it into something a bit more serious. Nothing lucrative or anything (actually the game is free and it was never intended to be paid nor have in-app purchases / ads), just something for the fans of incremental and RPG games, like me. A game made by and for RPG/idle games lovers.</p>

<p>So I decided to launch it on Google Play since that platform can help reach a bigger audience than just promoting it yourself, and people are more comfortable downloading apps from Google Play than downloading random .apks from other sites which may contain malware.</p>

<p>In June (2 months ago) I created my Google Play dev account and offered a total of 200 (the maximum Google Play allows you to) spots for alpha testing to my community. We filled the list and more than 100 people kept playing the game for more than those 2 weeks required for the app to be approved for production. The alpha testing ended up being slightly more than 1 month long.</p>

<p>For this whole month of alpha testing, over 50 versions were built and (not sure about the exact numbers) around 20-30 were uploaded to Google Play. Meanwhile, in the internal testing track, over 50 versions were pushed for me and my close friends to keep testing new features before adding them to the alpha testing or the official release.</p>

<p>No problems were found. Everything went well and the alpha testing period ended on July 19th of this year (last month).</p>

<p>I kept pushing versions on a daily basis to the internal testing for no more than 4 friends + myself, and kept testing everything. Some days I would even upload 2-3 versions that day.</p>

<p>The app was ready to be launched and I announced its launch for August 20th, 3 days ago.</p>

<p>I published the app. Around 1K downloads were made within the first 24 hours.</p>

<p>I then made <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/incremental_games/comments/1ex2xpy/comment/ljjnvqz/?context=3">this post</a>, which as of today has been edited removing the Google Play links and changing them for different ones since the Google Play app is no longer available.</p>

<p>Everyone was happy and I was proud of the game. A free idle game with no ads, no in-app purchases and no P2W. No possibility to spend any money nor have nasty ads 24/7. After all, I did it because I loved it.</p>

<p>The next morning I woke up with a mail from Google. The app had been deleted due to "Malware or Deceptive Behavior". How could it be? I had already stated everything the app did in my Privacy Policy, and after starting an antivirus scan, no malware was found in my PC.</p>

<p>So I appealed it. Within a few minutes I received a mail stating that the decision would be upholded and the app would not come back.</p>

<p>I was really confused. What kind of deceptive behavior could it have?</p>

<p>After reviewing my code over and over, thousands of lines of it, I found a single line of code that could've been the cause of the problem.</p>

<p>Someone on Discord requested the game to keep the phone's screen always on while the game was active. They even attached a link of someone sharing their piece of code with that function included. It was an Unity integrated (I build in Unity) function:</p>

<p><code>Screen.SleepTimeout = SleepTimeout.NeverSleep();</code></p>

<p>I really liked the idea because if my players wanted it, I couldn't see any reason to not give it to them.</p>

<p>That was the only function I used that would not request the user's consent to make changes in the device's settings. It only worked while the game was active, but it's enough to break Google Play's policies.</p>

<p>I didn't know that this would be a problem or break Google Play's policies. I didn't even know this actually changed the phone's settings, but I'll take the blame for not reading further into this function and knowing this could be a problem.</p>

<p>The thing is, the version that was marked as "Deceptive Behavior" was not the live one, it was the one I sent for revision to hotfix a bug. And they didn't "refuse" it, they completely deleted the app, not only the "under revision" build.</p>

<p>So I re-appealed stating that I'm now aware of what I did wrong and that I'm willing to take that piece of code out because it's not my intention to modify anyone's settings without their consent. The same answer was given within a few minutes.</p>

<p>But in their initial mail they stated that, if I sent a new version compliant with their terms, they could re-enable the app. But I couldn't send any new revisions since my app got completely deleted, my Google Play Console's panel was totally inaccesible.</p>

<p>So I thought the way (and what they meant by sending a new version) was creating a new app and re-send it for revision, starting the same process of 2 weeks with 20 or more testers over again. But I wouldn't mind, I just wanted my game to be out there and share it with everyone.</p>

<p>I didn't even have time to upload the new version when I received another mail from Google. I had just put the name to the new app and I was doing the ESRB rating survey when I received it.</p>

<p>Not only my app, but my whole dev account was completely closed FOREVER, and any attempt at creating any new account would result in closure as well. I lost the opportunity to publish anything in Google Play for my whole life as a game or app developer.</p>

<p>And it started with a function of keeping the screen turned on while the game was open. I really feel like a fool for not thinking this could be a problem.</p>

<p>My guess is that they deleted the account because I broke another rule: uploading a rejected app twice.</p>

<p>I know this now because I read almost all the policy after having my account closed to see what I could've done wrong, but I didn't know I would break a rule by uploading a compliant version of a rejected app when they asked me to do so in order to save my app.</p>

<p>With all this story I want to share my pain with anyone that has had a similar problem, and remember that sometimes a little misstep followed by lack of knowledge can turn a little problem into a really big one.</p>

<p>I am no one to judge whether this is fair or not, but I definitely feel terribly bad for having lost something that not only made me really happy and feel fullfilled, but also gave me hope to create a good game everyone could enjoy.</p>

<p>Thank you if you've read this far and sorry again for the long post.</p>

<p>Edit: And sorry if this sounds too intense, it's just frustrating that this happened after investing a lot of time, money and hopes in something that would end up like this 24 hours after its launch.</p>

<p>Peace.</p>

Log message:
The greek quiz is so obscure that it is ridiculous -- noone can play
this.  Replace it with a new quiz about galley (ship) parts.  This
commit changes the *LAST UNMODIFIED ORIGINAL FILE* (meaning revision
1.1.1.1) from the original import that created OpenBSD on Oct 18,
1995.  With this commit, we have completed an amusing mission of
replacing the final parts of the original OpenBSD.

We have reached OpenBSD of Theseus.

<p>With an operating system as old as Windows, what Microsoft decides to remove is often just as (if not more) newsworthy as what it is trying to add. You may or may not care about new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/windows-utilities-like-paint-and-snipping-tool-could-get-an-ai-infusion-soon/">AI-themed MS Paint additions</a> or the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/microsoft-will-try-the-data-scraping-windows-recall-feature-again-in-october/">soon-to-be-reborn Recall feature</a>, but you've almost certainly interacted with one of Windows' Control Panel applets at some point in the last 39 years. And according to a note <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/system-configuration-tools-in-windows-f8a49657-b038-43b8-82d3-28bea0c5666b">buried on Microsoft's support site</a>, those Control Panels' days may be numbered (emphasis ours):</p>
<p>"The Control Panel is a feature that's been part of Windows for a long time. It provides a centralized location to view and manipulate system settings and controls," the support page explains. "Through a series of applets, you can adjust various options ranging from system time and date to hardware settings, network configurations, and more. <strong>The Control Panel is in the process of being deprecated in favor of the Settings app, which offers a more modern and streamlined experience.</strong>"</p>

<p>This won't be news to anyone who has followed Windows' development over the last decade. The Settings app was initially introduced in Windows 8 in 2012 as a touchscreen-friendly alternative for some of the Control Panel applets, but during the Windows 10 era it began picking up more and more Control Panel settings, and by the time Windows 11 rolled around it was full-featured enough to serve as a complete Control Panel replacement most of the time, with a handful of exceptions made for especially obscure changes (and those who simply prefer the Old Ways).</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>But while individual Control Panel applets have disappeared over the years—the Displays panel, the Add/Remove Programs screen, panels for deprecated features like Homegroups—Microsoft's note suggests that the rest of the applets may disappear en masse in some future Windows update. That said, for now, there's nothing that's changing in Windows. Even the upcoming 24H2 update still has all the old Control Panels in it, and the gap between "deprecated" and "removed" can span years.</p>
<p>What's incredible about some of the Control Panels at this point is how far back some of their designs go. You're never more than a double-click away from some piece of UI that has been essentially exactly the same since 1996's Windows NT 4.0, when Microsoft's more-stable NT operating system was refreshed with the same user interface as Windows 95 (modern Windows versions descend from NT, and not 95 or 98). The Control Panel idea is even older, dating all the way back to Windows 1.0 in 1985.</p>
<p>Most of the current Control Panel designs and iconography settled down back in Windows Vista and Windows 7 in 2006 and 2009, which explains why so many of the panels still feature the rounded, glassy look that defines those versions of the operating system (check out the way the clock looks in our screenshots above). It's one of the few areas of the operating system that hasn't been spruced up for Windows 11, which is otherwise probably Microsoft's most cohesive Windows design since 95 and NT 4.0; even old apps like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/hell-freezes-over-ms-paint-adds-support-for-layers-and-png-transparency/">Paint</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/notepads-spellcheck-and-autocorrect-are-rolling-out-to-everybody-after-41-years/">Notepad</a> have gotten facelifts, while other Windows 7-era holdovers like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/microsoft-is-killing-wordpad-windows-28-year-old-built-in-word-processor/">WordPad</a> have been put out to pasture.</p>

            <guid>41329505</guid>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/dpjudas/SurrealEngine">https://github.com/dpjudas/SurrealEngine</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41329505">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Surreal Engine</h2><a id="user-content-surreal-engine" aria-label="Permalink: Surreal Engine" href="#surreal-engine"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The goal of this project is to reimplement enough of the original Unreal Engine to make the Unreal Tournament (UT99) maps playable.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5136903/125014285-afc65580-e06d-11eb-80c0-0a1992a7d0ff.jpg"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5136903/125014285-afc65580-e06d-11eb-80c0-0a1992a7d0ff.jpg" alt="facingworlds"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Current status</h2><a id="user-content-current-status" aria-label="Permalink: Current status" href="#current-status"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The engine can load and render the maps. The Unrealscript VM is almost feature complete - only arrays and network conditional execution are not implemented yet.</p>
<p dir="auto">It will attempt to load all level actors and initialize the map. However, while the menus and the HUD will appear, there are still many native functions not implemented yet. It is also quite possible some events aren't firing as they should. You will therefore see exceptions shown if you interact with them and that is where the project is at.</p>
<p dir="auto">At the time of this writing, SurrealEngine can detect the following UE1 games:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Unreal Tournament (v436, v451b, v469(a, b, c, d))</li>
<li>Unreal (v200, v209, v220, v224v, v225f, v226f)</li>
<li>Unreal Gold (v226b, v227(i, j, k_11))</li>
<li>Deus Ex (v1002f, v1112fm)</li>
<li>Klingon Honor Guard (219)</li>
<li>NERF Arena Blast (v300)</li>
<li>TNN Outdoors Pro Hunter (v200)</li>
<li>Rune Classic (v1.10)</li>
<li>Clive Barker's Undying (v420)</li>
<li>Tactical-Ops: Assault on Terror (v3.4.0 and v3.5.0 - both running under UT436 and UT469 engines)</li>
<li>Wheel of Time (v333)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">From the list above, only Unreal Tournament v436 and Unreal Gold v226 is in a relatively playable state. Running any other game (and UT versions) can and will result in crashes.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Unreal Tournament v436</h3><a id="user-content-unreal-tournament-v436" aria-label="Permalink: Unreal Tournament v436" href="#unreal-tournament-v436"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The game launches, menu options will work and botmatches can be played, however the bots will barely have any AI (they move around sometimes and retaliate upon being attacked), and some maps will have some functionality missing (like DM-Morpheus will not have the "X leading the match" screens work).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Unreal Gold v226</h3><a id="user-content-unreal-gold-v226" aria-label="Permalink: Unreal Gold v226" href="#unreal-gold-v226"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The game launches, menu options will work most of the time. Single player maps can be played, as well as botmatches. The AI will behave more or less the same as how they behave in UT. Objects from Return to Na Pali have their models appear broken.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Deus Ex v1112fm</h3><a id="user-content-deus-ex-v1112fm" aria-label="Permalink: Deus Ex v1112fm" href="#deus-ex-v1112fm"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Only the intro flyby works. No keyboard or mouse inputs will be detected, as Deus Ex handles them differently than Unreal/UT.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Command line parameters</h2><a id="user-content-command-line-parameters" aria-label="Permalink: Command line parameters" href="#command-line-parameters"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><code>SurrealEngine [--url=&lt;mapname&gt;] [--engineversion=X] [Path to game folder]</code></p>
<p dir="auto">You can simply copy paste the SurrealEngine executable inside the System folder of your UE1 game of choice, and run it from there. If no game folder is specified, and the executable isn't in a System folder, the engine will search the registry (Windows only) for the registry keys Epic originally set. If no URL is specified it will use the default URL in the ini file (per default the intro map). The --engineversion argument overrides the internal version detected by the engine and should only be used for debugging purposes.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Windows build instructions</h2><a id="user-content-windows-build-instructions" aria-label="Permalink: Windows build instructions" href="#windows-build-instructions"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Use CMake to build the project. A recent version of Visual Studio, and MSVC compiler that supports C++17 is required.</p>
<p dir="auto">On Windows, SDL2 is an optional dependency that you need to supply locally yourself (download the Visual C++ version of SDL2, extract it somewhere and point to that folder in CMake settings). Supplying SDL2 will allow you to use it as an alternative windowing system.</p>
<p dir="auto">Other than that there are no other external third party dependencies.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Linux build instructions</h2><a id="user-content-linux-build-instructions" aria-label="Permalink: Linux build instructions" href="#linux-build-instructions"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Use CMake to build the project.</p>
<p dir="auto">From the folder you want to clone the repo to (commands should be entered in the given order):</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/dpjudas/SurrealEngine.git
cd SurrealEngine
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j 16"><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/dpjudas/SurrealEngine.git
cd SurrealEngine
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j 16
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">When compilation is successfully finished, <code>build</code> folder should contain these 3 executables: <code>SurrealEngine</code>, <code>SurrealEditor</code> and <code>SurrealDebugger</code></p>
<p dir="auto">You'll need the dev packages for the following things:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>cmake</li>
<li>g++</li>
<li>pthreads</li>
<li>dl</li>
<li>alsa (libasound2)</li>
<li>SDL2</li>
<li>waylandpp (optional) (C++ bindings for Wayland, used on ZWidget Wayland backend)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">On Linux, SDL2 is required, as SurrealEngine will utilise it for its windowing functionalities and native Wayland support (with <code>SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that these packages won't always have the exact names given above, as it can change from distro to distro. In general, if you get an include error that looks like it is trying to include something external, then you are probably missing the dev package for that library. :)</p>
