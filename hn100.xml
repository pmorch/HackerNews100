            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/10/brute_force_ai_era_gartner/">https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/10/brute_force_ai_era_gartner/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41500268">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>AI techniques that require specialist hardware are "doomed," according to analyst firm Gartner's chief of research for AI Erick Brethenoux – who included GPUs in his definition of endangered kit.</p>
<p>Speaking to <i>The Register</i> at Gartner's Symposium in Australia today, Brethenoux said in the 45 years he's spent observing AI, numerous hardware vendors have offered offer specialist kit for AI workloads. All failed once vanilla machines could do the job – as they always eventually can.</p>
<p>The need for specialist hardware, he observed, is a sign of the "brute force" phase of AI, in which programming techniques are yet to be refined and powerful hardware is needed. "If you cannot find the elegant way of programming … it [the AI application] dies," he added.</p>

    

<p>He suggested generative AI will not be immune to this trend.</p>

        


        

<p>The good news is, he believes organizations can benefit from AI without generative AI.</p>
<p>"Generative AI is 90 percent of the airwaves and five percent of the use cases," he noted – and users have already learned that lesson.</p>

        

<p>Brethenoux described the period from late 2022 to early 2024 as a "recess" in which IT shops "stopped thinking about things that make money" and explored generative AI instead. Those efforts have largely led orgs back to the AI they already use – or to "composite AI" that uses generative AI alongside established AI techniques like machine learning, knowledge graphs, or rule-based systems.</p>
<p>Organizations have realized that AI may already be making a big contribution to the business in many scenarios that engineers appreciate – such as machine learning informing predictive maintenance apps – but which never caught the eye of execs or the board. Recess is over.</p>
<p>An example of composite AI at work could be generative AI creating text to describe the output of a predictive maintenance application. <i>The Register</i> has often heard the same scenario applied to software that analyzes firewall logs and which now uses generative AI to make prose recommendations about necessary actions that improve security – and even writes new firewall rules to enact them.</p>

        

<p>Brethenoux recalled that some orgs he speaks to still think generative AI can power their next application. He often tells them the same outcome can be achieved more quickly – at lower cost – with an established AI technique.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/05/amazon_q_developer_gartner/">Amazon congratulates itself for AI code that mostly works</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Gartner's Symposium featured another session with similar themes.</p>
<p>Titled "When not to use generative AI," it featured vice president and distinguished analyst Bern Elliot pointing out that Gen AI has no reasoning powers and produces only "a probabilistic sequence" of content. Even so, Elliot said Gen AI hype has reached two to three times the volume Gartner has seen for any previous tech. Generative AI is, in short, being asked to solve problems it was not designed to solve.</p>
<p>Elliot recommended not using it to tackle tasks other than content generation, knowledge discovery, and powering conversational user interfaces.</p>
<p>Even in those roles, he described the tech as "Unreliable like Swiss cheese: you know it has holes, you just don't know where they are until you cut it."</p>
<p>Elliot conceded that improvements to Gen AI have seen the frequency with which it "hallucinates" – producing responses with no basis in fact – fall to one or two percent. But he warned users not to see that improvement as a sign the tech is mature. "It's great until you do a lot of prompts – millions of hallucinations in production is a problem!"</p>
<p>Like Brethenoux, Elliot therefore recommended composite AI as a safer approach, and adopting guardrails that use a non-generative AI technique to check generative results. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
    
    <p><em>We like to write software!</em> Coding is a zigzag journey of problem-solving,
    and the destination is less important than some might think.</p>
    <p>We often get asked questions like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>“Why are you doing this?”</li>
      <li>“What is the purpose of this project?”</li>
      <li>“What does this project do better than <strong>X</strong>?”</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Silicon Valley Cutthroat</h2>
    <p>If one spends a lot of time on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, or other
    startup-oriented news sites, they might believe that everyone is working on their next
    multi-million-dollar startup and/or exit strategy. It may be hard to imagine that people work
    on open source code purely for the fun of it.</p>
    <p><strong>There are hackers</strong> who just love <em>the art of building software</em>.
    They do it for the challenge, for the fun of it. They aren’t trying to make a million dollars.</p>

    <h2>Consumer Culture</h2>
    <p>Or, if one is used to <em>consuming</em> other software only, and rarely
    creating any, they might get stuck in a mindset of thinking “what can this project do for me?”
    (And if the project isn’t relevant to them, they wonder why it exists.)</p>
    <p><strong>There are hackers</strong> who don’t need lots of people to consume their software.
    Of course, they would love it if others enjoyed/admired/appreciated their work, but that's not
    strictly necessary. <em>It's just fun to create.</em></p>

    <h2>We do it just for the fun of it. No, really.</h2>
    <p>Lastly, if one has learned enough programming technique to do their day job and not a lot
    more, then they might not appreciate programmers who are always trying new things.</p>
    <p><strong>There are hackers</strong> who live and breathe code, and the idea that every line
    of code must prove its monetary value, that every hour spent toiling away at the keyboard
    must be accounted for, is a damn shame.
    </p><p><em>The process itself, flaws and all, has value</em>—not just the
    final product.</p>
    <p>I'll end with my favorite quote about programming:</p>
    <blockquote>
      The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff.
      He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination.
      Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable
      of realizing grand conceptual structures....
      Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves
      and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself.
    </blockquote>
    <p>—Fred Brooks, <em>The Mythical Man-Month</em></p>

    <h2>Try it!</h2>
    <p>If you, dear reader, think you may have lost your way—that coding used to be fun
    for you, but now it's just a slog of clocking in and out to get a paycheck,
    then allow us to invite you back!</p>
    <p>Or, if you were conditioned to think that wild-idea programming is only for professionals
    and academics, this page is for you. You have the right to tinker, and have fun doing it!</p>
    <p>Think of something that you might like to build, learn, experience inside the computer,
    and just jump in. Without looking or researching first.
    <em>You might just have a bit of fun. No, really.</em></p>

<p>Harrison.rad.1 excels in the same radiology exams taken by human radiologists, as well as in benchmarks against other foundational models.</p>
<p>The Fellowship of the Royal College of Radiologists (FRCR) 2B Rapids exam is considered one of the leading and toughest certifications for radiologists. Only 40-59% of human radiologists pass on their first attempt. Radiologists who re-attempt the exam within a year of passing score an average of 50.88 out of 60 (84.8%)*.</p>
<p>Harrison.rad.1 scored 51.4 out of 60 (85.67%). Other competing models, including OpenAI’s GPT-4o, Microsoft’s LLaVA-Med, Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro, mostly scored below 30**, which is statistically no better than random guessing.</p>

<p>On Monday, the US Department of Justice's next monopoly trial against Google started in Virginia—this time <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/googles-ad-tech-dominance-spurs-more-antitrust-charges-report-says/">challenging the tech giant's ad tech dominance</a>.</p>
<p>The trial comes after Google lost two major cases that proved <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/google-loses-dojs-big-monopoly-trial-over-search-business/">Google had a monopoly in both general search</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/12/googles-android-app-store-monopoly-violates-antitrust-law-jury-finds/">the Android app store</a>. During her opening statement, DOJ lawyer Julia Tarver Wood told US District Judge Leonie Brinkema—who will be ruling on the case after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/google-sends-doj-unexpected-check-in-attempt-to-avoid-monopoly-jury-trial/">Google cut a check to avoid a jury trial</a>—that "it’s worth saying the quiet part out loud," AP News<a href="https://apnews.com/article/google-antitrust-ad-tech-virginia-opening-7a19f525287f782609a5316b1fdb08f0"> reported</a>.</p>
<p>"One monopoly is bad enough," Wood said. "But a trifecta of monopolies is what we have here."</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/US-v-Google-Ad-Tech-Complaint.pdf">complaint</a>, the DOJ argued that Google broke competition in the ad tech space "by engaging in a systematic campaign to seize control of the wide swath of high-tech tools used by publishers, advertisers, and brokers, to facilitate digital advertising."</p>
<p>The result of such "insidious" allegedly anti-competitive behavior is that today Google pockets at least 30 cents "of each advertising dollar flowing from advertisers to website publishers through Google’s ad tech tools ... and sometimes far more," the DOJ alleged.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as Google profits off both advertisers and publishers, "website creators earn less, and advertisers pay more" than "they would in a market where unfettered competitive pressure could discipline prices and lead to more innovative ad tech tools," the DOJ alleged.</p>
<p>On Monday, Wood told Brinkema that Google intentionally put itself in this position to "manipulate the rules of ad auctions to its own benefit," The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/09/09/google-antitrust-doj-adtech-monopoly/">reported</a>.</p>
<p>“Publishers were understandably furious,” Wood said. “The evidence will show that they could do nothing.”</p>
<p>Wood confirmed that the DOJ planned to call several publishers as witnesses in the coming weeks to explain the harms caused. Expected to take the stand will be "executives from companies including USA Today, [Wall Street] Journal parent company News Corp., and the Daily Mail," the Post reported.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>The ad tech trial, which is expected to last four to six weeks, may be the most consequential of the monopoly trials Google has recently faced, experts have said.</p>
<p>That's because during the DOJ's trial <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/google-loses-dojs-big-monopoly-trial-over-search-business/">proving Google's monopoly in search</a>, it remained unclear what remedies the DOJ sought. Some <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/all-the-possible-ways-to-destroy-googles-monopoly-in-search/">ways to destroy Google's search monopoly</a> could be "unlikely to create meaningful competition" or hurt Google's bottom line, experts told Ars, but a more drastic order to spin out its Chrome browser or Android operating system could really impact Google's revenue. It won't be until December that the DOJ will even provide a rough outline of proposed remedies in that case, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/google-search-monopoly-case-remedies-come-by-december-2024-09-06/">reported</a>, with the judge not expected to rule until next August.</p>
<p>But the DOJ has been very clear about the remedies needed in the ad tech case, "asking Brinkema to order a divestment of Google’s Ad Manager suite of services, which is responsible for many of the rectangular ads that populate the tops and sides of webpages across the Internet," the Post reported.</p>
<p>Because the most "obvious" remedy would be to require Google to sell off parts of its ad business, experts told AP News that the ad tech trial "could potentially be more harmful to Google" than the search trial. Perhaps at the furthest extreme, antitrust expert Shubha Ghosh told Ars that "if this case goes against Google as the last one did, it could set the stage for splitting it into separate search and advertising companies."</p>
<p>In the DOJ's complaint, prosecutors argued that it "is critical to restore competition in these markets by enjoining Google’s anticompetitive practices, unwinding Google’s anticompetitive acquisitions, and imposing a remedy sufficient both to deny Google the fruits of its illegal conduct and to prevent further harm to competition in the future."</p>
<p>Ghosh said that undoing Google's acquisitions could lead to Google no longer representing both advertisers' and sellers' interests in each ad auction—instead requiring Google to either pick a side or perhaps involve a broker.</p>
<p>Although the Post reported that Google has argued that "customers prefer the convenience of a one-stop shop," the DOJ hopes to prove that Google's alleged monopoly has shuttered newspapers across the US and threatens to do more harm if left unchecked.</p>

<p>I’ve been a l<span>oud cheerleader for this product and have been heavily promoting it since Taki first announced it.&nbsp; I’d love to see this one get embraced as much as the QMTech DE-10 that seems like an excellent alternative, however both boards require new cases and not everyone has the ability to print their own for this project.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>Also, I wouldn’t be doing my job if I didn’t mention all the red flags this has set off with everyone who’s ever manufactured products before; I’ve been creating and launching products for almost two decades now (at both much higher and lower quantities than this) and the information provided to us about this project over the last two months doesn’t line up with <em>any</em> manufacturing experience I’ve ever had.</span></p>
<p>I’ll personally be waiting for a deep-dive comparison to both the original DE-10 and the QMTech version of the same board, <a href="https://www.retrorgb.com/de10-nano-vs-qmtechs-clone.html">like Ken recently did</a> before buying one.&nbsp; I’d also like to see people who understand how the cores work, do a side-by-side comparison of all three solutions, however my gut tells me they’ll all work the same.</p>
<p>So, if you’re a tinkerer, get one and see how it performs.&nbsp; My guess is it’ll be fine and the contradictory information was just a result of inexperience with manufacturing.&nbsp; Fingers crossed though.</p>

	<a href="https://variety.com/t/james-earl-jones/" id="auto-tag_james-earl-jones" data-tag="james-earl-jones">James Earl Jones</a>,&nbsp;the prolific film, TV and theater actor whose resonant, unmistakable baritone was most widely known as the voice of “<a href="https://variety.com/t/star-wars/" id="auto-tag_star-wars" data-tag="star-wars">Star Wars</a>” villain <a href="https://variety.com/t/darth-vader/" id="auto-tag_darth-vader" data-tag="darth-vader">Darth Vader</a>, died Monday morning at his home in Dutchess County, N.Y., his rep confirmed to <em>Variety.</em> He was 93.</p>



<p>
	After overcoming a profound stutter as a child, Jones established himself as one of the pioneering Black actors of his generation, amassing a bountiful and versatile career spanning over 60 years, from his debut on Broadway in 1958 at the Cort Theatre — renamed the James Earl Jones Theatre in 2022 —&nbsp;to his most recent performance in 2021’s “Coming 2 America.” For that film, Jones reprised his role as King Jaffe Joffer from the 1988 Eddie Murphy comedy “Coming to America” — one of several roles, along with Darth Vader, that Jones revisited, including the voice of King Mufasa in Disney’s animated feature “The Lion King” in 1994, the 1998 direct-to-video sequel and the 2019 remake,&nbsp;and CIA deputy director Vice Admiral James Greer in three Jack Ryan movies, 1990’s “The Hunt for Red October,” 1992’s “Patriot Games” and 1994’s “Clear and Present Danger.”&nbsp;

	</div>




<p>
	Among his more than 80 film credits, Jones’ other notable movies include as a B-52 bombardier in Stanley Kubrick’s 1964 Cold War satire “Dr. Strangelove” (his feature film debut), as the first Black president of the United States in 1972’s “The Man,” as the fearsome villain in 1982’s “Conan the Barbarian,” as a reclusive author in 1989’s “Field of Dreams,” as a blind former baseball star in 1993’s “The Sandlot,” and as a minister living in apartheid South Africa in 1995’s “Cry, the Beloved Country.”</p>



<p>
	Jones was nominated for four Tony Awards, and won two, in 1969 for playing boxer Jack Johnson in “The Great White Hope” (which he reprised on film in 1970, receiving his only Oscar nomination), and in 1987 for originating the role of Troy Maxson in August Wilson’s Pulitzer Prize-winning drama “Fences.” He was nominated for eight primetime Emmy awards, winning twice in 1991, for supporting actor in the miniseries “Heat Wave,” about the 1965 Watts riots, and for lead actor in the drama series “Gabriel’s Fire,” about a wrongfully imprisoned ex-cop who becomes a private detective. It was&nbsp;the first time an actor won two Emmys in the same year.

	</p>




<p>
	Jones earned a Kennedy Center Honor in 2002, the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement award in 2009, an honorary Oscar in 2011 and a lifetime achievement Tony Award in 2017. His Grammy award in 1977 for spoken word album makes Jones only one a handful of actors to receive an EGOT.</p>



<p>
	Jones’ looming yet ultimately affable presence and rich speaking voice made him a natural for Shakespeare, and he played some of the great roles, such as Macbeth and Othello, for Joseph Papp’s American Shakespeare Festival. Jones narrated several documentaries, from 1972’s “Malcom X” to the 2007 Disneynature doc “Earth,” and, famously, he intoned the tagline “This is CNN” for the cable news channel.</p>



<p>
	His television credits, which number over 70, including many movies and miniseries such as “Roots” and “The Atlanta Child Murders,” recurring roles on “L.A. Law,” “Homicide: Life on the Street” and “Everwood,” and guest roles on shows like “The Simpsons,” “Picket Fences,” “Law &amp; Order,” “Frasier” and “House.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	As for his most famous role, Jones was paid $7,000 to lend his voice to Darth Vader in 1977’s “Star Wars: A New Hope,” but he declined screen credit for that film and its sequel, 1980’s “The Empire Strikes Back,” out of deference to the actor who played the role on screen, David Prowse. By 1983’s “Return of the Jedi,” however, Jones had become fully synonymous with one of the most memorable and terrifying villains in cinema history, and received credit for his work. He returned to Vader’s voice again for 2005’s “Episode III — Revenge of the Sith” and 2016’s “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,” but for the 2022 Disney+ series “Obi-Wan Kenobi,” Jones instead authorized Lucasfilm to use archival recordings and AI technology <a href="https://variety.com/2022/artisans/news/james-earl-jones-darth-vader-retiring-star-wars-ai-1235382827/">to recreate Vader’s voice</a>.</p>



<p>
	When asked in 2014 by the New York Times about how he’d kept his career alive for so long, Jones’ response evoked the kind of plainspoken humility that he had so often brought to his performances as well.</p>



<p>
	“The secret is never forgetting that you’re a journeyman actor and that nothing is your final thing, nothing is your greatest thing, nothing is your worst thing,” Jones <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/magazine/james-earl-jones-on-darth-vader-mufasa-and-natch-totes-mcgotes.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">said</a>. “I still consider myself a novice.”</p>



<hr>



<p>
	James Earl Jones was born in 1931 on a farm in in Arkabutla, Miss. His father, Robert Earl Jones, left home soon after to pursue his own acting career (the two more-or-less reconciled when the younger Jones was in his 20s, and they even performed together). When Jones was 5, he moved with his maternal grandparents to Michigan. The shock of the relocation induced a stammer so severe that he often could communicate only in writing. It wasn’t until high school when he started to overcome his stutter, when his English teacher, upon learning that Jones composed poetry, encouraged him to read his writing aloud in class.</p>



<p>
	As an undergraduate student at the University of Michigan, Jones initially set out to study medicine, but wound up more interested in drama. His first stage role was a small part in the 1957 Off Broadway production “Wedding in Japan.” He took side jobs to supplement occasional theater work in Broadway’s “Sunrise at Campobello,” “The Cool World” and “The Pretender.” He also appeared in summer stock.</p>



<p>
	In 1960, Jones joined Papp’s New York Shakespeare Festival. The following year he made his first serious impact in a landmark Off Broadway production of Jean Genet’s “The Blacks” as the protagonist Deodatus. Afterwards, for Papp, he played Oberon in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” the first of many heralded Shakespearean turns. His masterful 1964 performance as Othello for Papp was moved Off Broadway, where the production ran for almost a year.&nbsp;

<p>
	Jones’ first big break into cinema came by way of Papp’s production of “The Merchant of Venice,” in which Jones played the Prince of Morocco to George C. Scott’s Shylock. When Stanley Kubrick came to see Scott, whom he was considering for one of the leads in “Dr. Strangelove,” the film director was so impressed that he cast Jones in the film, too. In 1966, Jones had the title role in “Macbeth” at the New York Shakespeare Festival, again to great acclaim. He also booked a recurring role on “As the World Turns” in 1966, marking the first time a Black actor had a continuing role on a daytime soap opera</p>



<p>
	Still, he was almost one of Broadway’s best-kept secrets until 1968 with his performance in Howard Sackler’s “The Great White Hope” as Jack Johnson, the first Black man to win the world heavyweight boxing championship. The Tony, the acclaim and its timing in the late ’60s propelled Jones into the spotlight at a time when it was difficult for Black actors to secure quality roles. The actor, however, has said that the accolades he received for for both the play and its film adaptation did not do that much for his career.</p>



<p>
	It wasn’t until 1977, when Jones’ voice terrified audiences for the first time as Darth Vader, that things truly began to shift for him. That same year, Jones also appeared in ABC’s “Roots” playing the author Alex Haley, whose genealogical novel of the same title inspired the groundbreaking miniseries. He never quite became an outright star in the classic sense of the word, but the back-to-back successes that year did ultimately make Jones a household name, whose presence connoted a stature and gravitas to projects that might otherwise be lacking.</p>



<p>
	Theatre is where Jones most frequently was a box office draw in his own right —&nbsp;and well into his 80s. He returned to Broadway in 2005 for a production of “On Golden Pond” opposite Leslie Uggams, drawing another Tony nomination. In 2008, he played Big Daddy in a production of Tennessee Williams’ “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof” that featured an all-Black cast including Terrence Howard, Anika Noni Rose and Phylicia Rashad.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Two years later, he returned to Broadway in a revival of “Driving Miss Daisy” opposite Vanessa Redgrave; the production’s move to London in 2011 meant he had to miss the Honorary Oscars ceremony in Los Angeles. Instead, Sir Ben Kingsley surprised Jones with his statuette in person after he’d concluded a matinee performance of the show.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Jones was first married to actress-singer Julienne Marie. His second wife of 34 years, actress Cecilia Hart, died in 2016. He is survived his son, Flynn Earl Jones.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>also the August 2024 financial update, but I’m trying not to bury the lede.<!-- --></em></p>
<!-- --><p>Hi everyone,<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>We have come to the decision to cease operations of cohost and anti software software club due to lack of funding and burnout. As of today, none of us are being paid for our labor<!-- --><sup>1<!-- --></sup>; all of our money in the bank, and any money coming in from people who buy our merch or don’t cancel cohost plus, is going towards servers and operations — paying the bills so we can turn the lights off with as little disruption as possible.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>cohost will become read-only on Tuesday, October 1st. At this time, we will make best-effort attempts to keep the servers online through the end of 2024.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>Development focus has immediately shifted to data export. We have offered minimal data export for GDPR compliance for a while now, but this is a barebones system that doesn’t meet our quality standards. We will be improving this system over the next few weeks and will issue full data exports for all users when the site goes read-only. We will continue to offer downloads of your data export through the end of the read-only period.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>When the read-only period concludes, we will delete all of your data from our servers without a backup.  Even now we want to reiterate that we think “data brokerage” and other common practices of the software industry are inimical to who we are as people, and we would never consider selling your data to others or asserting any rights to stuff you posted under any circumstance.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>Majority control of the cohost source code will be transferred to the person who funded the majority of our operations, as per the terms of the funding documents we signed with them; Colin and I will retain small stakes so we have some input on what happens to it, at their request.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><hr aria-label="Footnotes">
<!-- --><ol>
<!-- --><li id="user-content-user-content-fn-1">
<!-- --><p>on that note, we’re looking for new jobs. we’ll each be posting about that bit individually. <!-- --></p>
<!-- --></li>
<!-- --></ol>
<!-- --></div><div><hr>
<!-- --><p>So, what happened? If you’ve read our financial updates, you know that we have never been profitable. This isn’t surprising, even with a team of four; social media is a notoriously unprofitable industry. We had planned to bring in new revenue with eggbux (our tipping and subscription product) but policy changes from Stripe forced us to cancel earlier this year.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>Since then, we’ve struggled to fill the revenue and morale gap. Colin and I have been doing this for five years, Aidan for three, Kara for nearly two. We’ve been at or over capacity on moderation, engineering, and general operations nearly this entire time. We have all been on-call 24/7/365 since we launched two and a half years ago. The day-to-day needs of just running the site meant developing alternative funding options wasn’t possible.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>MAU and MRR are down across the year. We’ve managed to build a social media platform that many of our users love, but we just don’t have enough users and we don’t have the resources to safely scale up. It’s important to know when to call it quits.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>We’re grateful for all the incredible things y’all have created on cohost. We’re grateful for eggbug. We’re grateful that we were able to try and show a better path for social media, even if it didn’t work out exactly as we would have liked.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>We’re going to do our best to keep things online through the end of the year with the money we have, but we might need additional funding to keep things up until then. If you would be able to contribute funds if necessary, please e-mail us at <!-- --><a href="mailto:corp@antisoftware.club">corp@antisoftware.club<!-- --></a>.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>Thank you all for having used cohost. We’ll see you around. <!-- --><img src="https://cohost.org/static/17aa2d48956926005de9.png" alt=":eggbug:" title=":eggbug:"></p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>We introduce Transfusion, a recipe for training a multi-modal model over discrete and continuous data. Transfusion combines the language modeling loss function (next token prediction) with diffusion to train a single transformer over mixed-modality sequences. We pretrain multiple Transfusion models up to 7B parameters from scratch on a mixture of text and image data, establishing scaling laws with respect to a variety of uni- and cross-modal benchmarks. Our experiments show that Transfusion scales significantly better than quantizing images and training a language model over discrete image tokens. By introducing modality-specific encoding and decoding layers, we can further improve the performance of Transfusion models, and even compress each image to just 16 patches. We further demonstrate that scaling our Transfusion recipe to 7B parameters and 2T multi-modal tokens produces a model that can generate images and text on a par with similar scale diffusion models and language models, reaping the benefits of both worlds.

        <div>To detect sleep apnea, Apple Watch uses the accelerometer to monitor small movements at the wrist that are associated with interruptions in normal respiratory patterns, tracked by a new Apple Watch metric called Breathing Disturbances. While some of these disturbances are normal, they are important to track as they can be used to help understand restfulness of sleep and, when occurring frequently over multiple nights, may be associated with sleep apnea. Users can view their nightly Breathing Disturbances in the Health app, where they are classified as elevated or not elevated, and can be viewed over a one-month, six-month, or one-year period.

                 <div>The sleep apnea notification algorithm was developed using advanced machine learning and an extensive data set of clinical-grade sleep apnea tests. The feature was then validated in a clinical study — unprecedented in size for sleep apnea technology. In the clinical validation study, every participant identified by the algorithm had at least mild sleep apnea. The feature is expected to receive marketing authorization from the FDA and other global health authorities soon. Sleep apnea notifications will be available in more than 150 countries and regions this month, including the U.S., the EU, and Japan.

The built-in Depth app is highly legible for easy underwater visibility, displaying the time, current depth, water temperature, duration under water, and maximum depth — with the option to automatically activate as soon as Apple Watch is submerged. Water temperature is also displayed in workout metrics during Pool Swim and Open Water Swim workouts.

Users can also view beaches near their location on a convenient map, and new complications show current tide information for their favorite spots or closest beaches at a glance.

                 <div>Audio can now be played back through the built-in speaker on Apple Watch Series 10. Just like with phone calls, users can listen to audio from a range of apps — including Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, and Apple Books, and third-party apps — right from their Apple Watch.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Apple Watch Series 10 also uses a new voice isolation neural network running on the 4-core Neural Engine to suppress background noise during phone or FaceTime audio calls, so a user’s voice sounds crisp and clear on the other end of the line — even in noisy environments like a crowded restaurant, a city street, or a windy day outside.

                 <div>For the first time, Apple Watch is available in a polished aluminum finish, jet black, with a distinctively glossy, reflective shine. To achieve this, the aluminum case is polished using nano-particles and then undergoes a 30-step anodization process. Apple Watch Series 10 also comes in an updated rose gold aluminum, along with the popular brushed silver aluminum.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>Additionally, Apple Watch Series 10 is available in an aerospace-grade polished titanium that replaces the stainless steel of previous generations. The new grade 5 titanium cases offer a spectacularly reflective, jewelry-like finish, while being almost 20 percent lighter than Apple Watch Series 9 in stainless steel. The titanium cases come in three stunning colors: natural, gold, and slate.

                 <div>Last year, Apple Watch became Apple’s first carbon neutral product by dramatically reducing carbon emissions across the three biggest sources — materials, electricity, and transportation — and using high-quality carbon credits from nature-based projects to offset the small amount of emissions remaining. With the introduction of Apple Watch Series 10, made with 100 percent recycled aluminum or 95 percent recycled titanium in the case, customers now can choose a carbon neutral option of any Apple Watch in any material. This is an important step toward Apple 2030, Apple’s ambitious plan to be carbon neutral across its entire carbon footprint by 2030.

<p>Apple has announced some new hearing health related features, coming as a software update for <a href="https://amzn.to/47rBsra">AirPods Pro 2</a>. </p>



<p>This includes a hearing protection mode being enabled by default, offering passive noise cancellation in loud environments. Apple is also launching a “clinical grade” hearing aid mode, as part of a software update coming later this year.</p>



<p>Firstly, users can take a clinically-validated hearing test. The hearing test uses your AirPods and iPhone, and can be conducted by a user in under five times. The result of your hearing test can be viewed securely in the Health app.</p>



<p>If hearing loss is detected, the hearing aid mode is then available to use. The AirPods will make it easier to hear sounds from the world around you. A custom hearing profile is automatically applied when listening to audio, like music or podcasts. </p>



<p>The hearing aid feature is currently making its way through the FDA and other regulatory bodies. Apple said the functionality will be available in more than 100 countries. The feature will be enabled through a free software update coming later this year to AirPods Pro 2.</p>
