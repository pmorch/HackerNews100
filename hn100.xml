<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p><em>Note: This is just me, thinking out loud; you absolutely do not need to think that I have carefully thought this through, or that this is a good idea. With expectations set as low as possible, let’s continue.</em></p>



<p>There are many old pieces of tech still in use, but there’s one that grinds my gears every time I try to use it: Email.</p>



<p>For users, email works pretty well. Sometimes it sends too many emails to Junk, but Email is old, reliable, easy to understand, and relatively easy to search. It’s a good system, and I’m not eager to replace it with Slack anytime soon.</p>



<p>However… the backend for email, is a mess. In escalating order (and “we” is used in a very imprecise, broad hand-waving sense for technologists):</p>



<ul>
<li>Many things in Email have no spec; even basic things. For example: When you reply, are you replying at the top of the message, or the bottom? It might even be a political question, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041224190115/http://lists.suse.com/archive/suse-linux-e/2002-Oct/1698.html">depending on who you ask</a>. This has been worked around by email clients basically guessing the order and rarely even showing the email’s original text, putting layers between the user and the actual message.</li>



<li>What HTML are you allowed to put in an email? Well… it depends. When there’s no spec, and Microsoft Outlook <a href="https://www.hteumeuleu.com/2020/outlook-rendering-engine/">abuses the Microsoft Word HTML renderer, it gets ugly</a>. There’s no guarantee the receiver even has an HTML renderer, and then it’s even more ugly.</li>



<li>How do you encrypt an email, from the provider itself? <a href="https://moxie.org/2015/02/24/gpg-and-me.html">Well, we invented this thing called OpenPGP, but almost nobody used it. Then it turned out to have major flaws.</a></li>



<li><a href="https://dmarcian.com/history-of-spf/">We couldn’t always make sure emails were authentic. So we invented SPF.</a></li>



<li><a href="https://postmarkapp.com/glossary/dkim-domainkeys-identified-mail">Then it turned out SPF didn’t fix everything. So we invented DKIM.</a></li>



<li><a href="https://dmarc.org/overview/">Then it turned out DKIM didn’t fix everything. So we invented DMARC.</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.zone.eu/blog/2024/05/17/bimi-and-dmarc-cant-save-you/">And then it turns out DKIM itself has major flaws that also bypass DMARC by extension.</a> </li>



<li><a href="https://postmarkapp.com/blog/what-the-heck-is-bimi">Also, because we threw on yet another layer called BIMI, which itself relies on DMARC, when DMARC relies on DKIM, and DKIM has flaws, then it’s exceedingly bad for users.</a></li>



<li><a href="https://dmarc.org/stats/dmarc/">Even if your sender has DMARC, 68.2% of records have their policy set to <code>p=none</code>. This tells DMARC to basically… do nothing!</a> (Sure, it technically speaking notifies the domain owner, but it’s clear the domain owners don’t care.)</li>



<li>Did I mention all of the above, plus aggressive anti-spam policies, makes self-hosting email insanely difficult?</li>



<li>Last, but not least, there’s the inane juggling of IP reputation. Some IP addresses are “cleaner” than other addresses, especially on shared systems like SendGrid or AWS SES. This makes signing up for a mass-mailing account, for whatever reason, messy; and causes countless surprise instances of legitimate emails going to Junk. Combine that with IP Address depletion, and the number of mostly clean addresses is shrinking over time.</li>
</ul>



<p>My gut reaction to the above is that we’ve got a lousy spec, with decades of cruft and unofficial spec, and we aren’t that great at securing it, or making sure messages are authentic. So… could we do better?</p>



<p>Thus the hypothetical: <em>2nd-gen email</em>.</p>



<p>Your initial reaction might be: That would be pointless, because not everyone would opt into it, and it would break compatibility all over the place. My thought is… that’s not necessarily a given. Imagine this:</p>



<ul>
<li>We create a new DNS record, called <code>MX2</code>. Most email services, then, would have an <code>MX2</code> and <code>MX</code> record. Older services only have <code>MX</code>.</li>



<li>If an ancient, 20 year old email client, tries to send a message – it finds the <code>MX</code> record and sends the message just like normal. A modern client sees the <code>MX2</code> and sends the message there if it exists; otherwise, it falls back to <code>MX</code>.</li>



<li>From there, the email services which implement <code>MX2</code> would publish a public date, on which all messages sent to them by the old <code>MX</code> record, will be automatically sent to Junk. If just Microsoft and Google alone agreed on such a date, that would be 40% of global email traffic.</li>
</ul>



<p>If the above looks slightly familiar, it’s because this strategy already worked, in a sense, with the transition from HTTP to HTTPS. We threw away a multi-decade-old protocol, for a new and more secure one. We set browsers to automatically upgrade the connection wherever possible, and now warn users about insecure connections when accessing HTTP (especially on login pages). Nevertheless – users can still visit HTTP pages, ancient browsers still work on HTTP, but most websites have gotten the memo and upgraded to HTTPS anyway. </p>



<p>The incentive to upgrading to <code>MX2</code> would be simple: Your messages, while they still would arrive, would go to Junk automatically past the publicly posted date. No business wants that, even if users are already trained to expect, and act, like that can happen. Thus, the incentive to upgrade without truly breaking any day-to-day compatibility.</p>



<p>Personally, I think that such a transition could go even faster than the HTTP to HTTPS transition. Self-hosted email is not very popular in part because of the complexity of the current email system, so between Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Zoho, GoDaddy, Gandhi, Wix, Squarespace, MailChimp, SparkPost, and SendGrid – you have most of the email market covered for the US; anyone not in the above list would quickly fold. The relative centralization of email, ironically, makes a mass upgrade to email much more achievable.</p>



<p>What would a 2nd-gen email prioritize then? Everyone has different priorities, but I’d personally suggest the following which would hopefully win a broad enough consensus if this idea goes anywhere (though experts, of which I am not one, would have plenty of their own ideas):</p>



<ol>
<li>A standardized HTML specification for email; complete with a test suite for conformance. Or, maybe we just declare a version of the HTML5 spec to be officially binding and that’s the end of it.</li>



<li>Headers for email chain preferences, or other email-specific preferences (i.e. Is this email chain a top-reply chain, or a bottom-reply chain? The client shouldn’t need to guess, or worse, ignore it.)</li>



<li>If an email has a rich, HTML view; it should be required to come with a text-only, non-HTML copy of the body as well; for accessibility, compatibility, and privacy reasons.</li>



<li>All MX2 records must have a public key embedded in the record. To send an email from the domain:<p>– A hash of the email content, and all headers, is created.<br>– This hash is then encrypted with the private key, corresponding to the record’s public key.<br>– This header is then added to the email, as the only permitted untrusted header.<br>– When an email is received, the header containing the hash is decrypted with the DNS public key, and the rest of the email is checked against the hash for integrity and authenticity. </p></li>



<li>Point #4 is a lot like DKIM and DMARC right now, except:<p>– There would always be an automatic reject policy (<code>p=reject</code>) . Currently, only 19.6% of email services which even have DKIM are this stringent.<br>– If headers do need to be added to an email, the spec can carefully define carve-outs for where untrusted data can go (i.e. if the spam filter wanted to add a header).<br>– There also could be standardized carve-outs for, say, appending untrusted data from the receiving server to a message body (i.e. your business could add data to the body’s top or bottom indicating that the message from an external recipient and you have legal obligations, but your email client can also clearly show that this was not part of the original message and is not signed).<br>– As such, the signing would not need to work around email compatibility to such an extent as DKIM, reducing the likelihood of critical flaws. </p></li>



<li>By simplifying the stack to the above, eliminating SPF, DKIM, and DMARC (and their respective configuration options), and standardizing on one record (MX2) for the future, running your own self-hosted email stack would become much easier. Additionally, the additional authenticity verifications would hopefully allow spam filters to be significantly less aggressive by authenticating against domains instead of IPs.</li>



<li>Point #6 is the biggest change – we’re no longer authenticating, or caring, about the IP Address that’s sending the email. Every email can and always would be verified against the domain using MX2 records and the public keys in them. Send a fake spam email? It doesn’t have a signature, so it gets tossed without any heuristics. Send a real spam email? Block that domain when there’s complaints. Go after the registrar (or treat domains belonging to that registrar as suspicious) if needed. This would mostly eliminate the need for IP reputation by replacing it with domain reputation – which, at least to me, is a far superior standard with more understandable and controllable outcomes(1).</li>



<li>Clients which implement MX2 can, optionally, have an updated encryption scheme to replace OpenPGP. Something like Apple’s Contact Key Verification. Hopefully there would be forward secrecy this time.</li>
</ol>



<div><p>If you have got great counterarguments, let me hear them.</p><p>(1) This would, perhaps, be the one and only “new feature” we could advertise to users. Not getting emails? You can just type in the name of the website, and always receive the emails.</p></div>



<p><em>Edit 1, for clarification: For bulk senders, there would be multiple MX2 records on the domain, each containing a public key for every authorized sender. One of those records would have a marker indicating it as suitable for incoming mail.</em></p>

            </span></p><p><span>DURHAM, N.C. – An HIV vaccine candidate developed at the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://dhvi.duke.edu/"><span>Duke Human Vaccine Institute</span></a><span> triggered low levels of an elusive type of broadly neutralizing HIV antibodies among a small group of people enrolled in a 2019 clinical trial.</span></p><p><span>The finding, reported May 17 in the journal Cell, not only provides proof that a vaccine can elicit these antibodies to fight diverse strains of HIV, but that it can also initiate the process within weeks, setting in motion an essential immune response.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The vaccine candidate targets an area on the HIV-1 outer envelope called the membrane proximal external region (MPER), which remains stable even as the virus mutates. Antibodies against this stable region in the HIV outer coat can block infection by many different circulating strains of HIV.</span></p><p><span>“This work is a major step forward as it shows the feasibility of inducing antibodies with immunizations that neutralize the most difficult strains of HIV,” said senior author&nbsp;</span><a href="https://medicine.duke.edu/profile/barton-ford-haynes"><span>Barton F. Haynes</span></a><span>, M.D., director of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute (DHVI). “Our next steps are to induce more potent neutralizing antibodies against other sites on HIV to prevent virus escape.&nbsp;We are not there yet, but the way forward is now much clearer.”</span></p><p><span>The research team analyzed data from a phase 1 clinical trial of a vaccine candidate developed by Haynes and S. Munir Alam, Ph.D., at DHVI.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Twenty healthy, HIV-negative people enrolled in the trial. Fifteen participants received two of four planned doses of the investigational vaccine, and five received three doses.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>After just two immunizations, the vaccine had a 95% serum response rate and a 100% blood CD4+ T-cell response rate -- two key measurements that demonstrated strong immune activation. Most of the serum responses mapped to the portion of the virus targeted by the vaccine.</span></p><p><span>Importantly, broadly neutralizing antibodies were induced after just two doses.</span></p><p><span>The trial was halted when one participant experienced a non-life-threatening allergic reaction, similar to rare incidences reported with COVID-19 vaccinations.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Bend</h2><a id="user-content-bend" aria-label="Permalink: Bend" href="#bend"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Bend is a massively parallel, high-level programming language.</p>
<p dir="auto">Unlike low-level alternatives like CUDA and Metal, Bend has the feeling and
features of expressive languages like Python and Haskell, including fast object
allocations, higher-order functions with full closure support, unrestricted
recursion, even continuations. Yet, it runs on massively parallel hardware like
GPUs, with near-linear speedup based on core count, and zero explicit parallel
annotations: no thread spawning, no locks, mutexes, atomics. Bend is powered by
the <a href="https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/hvm">HVM2</a> runtime.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">A Quick Demo</h2><a id="user-content-a-quick-demo" aria-label="Permalink: A Quick Demo" href="#a-quick-demo"></a></p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Using Bend</h2><a id="user-content-using-bend" aria-label="Permalink: Using Bend" href="#using-bend"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Currently not working on Windows, please use <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install" rel="nofollow">WSL2</a> as a workaround.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">First, install <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/rust-programming-by/9781788390637/e07dc768-de29-482e-804b-0274b4bef418.xhtml" rel="nofollow">Rust nightly</a>. Then, install both HVM2 and Bend with:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cargo +nightly install hvm
cargo +nightly install bend-lang"><pre>cargo +nightly install hvm
cargo +nightly install bend-lang</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Finally, write some Bend file, and run it with one of these commands:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="bend run    <file.hvm> # uses the Rust interpreter (sequential)
bend run-c  <file.hvm> # uses the C interpreter (parallel)
bend run-cu <file.hvm> # uses the CUDA interpreter (massively parallel)"><pre>bend run    <span>&lt;</span>file.hvm<span>&gt;</span> <span><span>#</span> uses the Rust interpreter (sequential)</span>
bend run-c  <span>&lt;</span>file.hvm<span>&gt;</span> <span><span>#</span> uses the C interpreter (parallel)</span>
bend run-cu <span>&lt;</span>file.hvm<span>&gt;</span> <span><span>#</span> uses the CUDA interpreter (massively parallel)</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You can also compile <code>Bend</code> to standalone C/CUDA files with <code>gen-c</code> and
<code>gen-cu</code>, for maximum performance. But keep in mind our code gen is still on its
infancy, and is nowhere as mature as SOTA compilers like GCC and GHC.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Parallel Programming in Bend</h2><a id="user-content-parallel-programming-in-bend" aria-label="Permalink: Parallel Programming in Bend" href="#parallel-programming-in-bend"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To write parallel programs in Bend, all you have to do is... <strong>nothing</strong>. Other
than not making it <em>inherently sequential</em>! For example, the expression:</p>

<p dir="auto">Can <strong>not</strong> run in parallel, because <code>+4</code> depends on <code>+3</code> which
depends on <code>(1+2)</code>. But the following expression:</p>

<p dir="auto">Can run in parallel, because <code>(1+2)</code> and <code>(3+4)</code> are independent; and it <em>will</em>,
per Bend's fundamental pledge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Everything that <strong>can</strong> run in parallel, <strong>will</strong> run in parallel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">For a more complete example, consider:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="def sum(depth, x):
  switch depth:
    case 0:
      return x
    case _:
      fst = sum(depth-1, x*2+0) # adds the fst half
      snd = sum(depth-1, x*2+1) # adds the snd half
      return fst + snd
    
def main:
  return sum(30, 0)"><pre><span>def</span> <span>sum</span>(<span>depth</span>, <span>x</span>):
  <span>switch</span> <span>depth</span>:
    <span>case</span> <span>0</span>:
      <span>return</span> <span>x</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>_</span>:
      <span>fst</span> <span>=</span> <span>sum</span>(<span>depth</span><span>-</span><span>1</span>, <span>x</span><span>*</span><span>2</span><span>+</span><span>0</span>) <span># adds the fst half</span>
      <span>snd</span> <span>=</span> <span>sum</span>(<span>depth</span><span>-</span><span>1</span>, <span>x</span><span>*</span><span>2</span><span>+</span><span>1</span>) <span># adds the snd half</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>fst</span> <span>+</span> <span>snd</span>
    
<span>def</span> <span>main</span>:
  <span>return</span> <span>sum</span>(<span>30</span>, <span>0</span>)</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This code adds all numbers from 0 up to (but not including) 2^30. But, instead
of a loop, we use a recursive divide-and-conquer approach. Since this approach
is <em>inherently parallel</em>, Bend will run it multi-threaded. Some benchmarks:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">CPU, Apple M3 Max, 1 thread: <strong>3.5 minutes</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">CPU, Apple M3 Max, 16 threads: <strong>10.26 seconds</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">GPU, NVIDIA RTX 4090, 32k threads: <strong>1.88 seconds</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">That's a <strong>111x speedup</strong> by doing nothing. No thread spawning, no explicit
management of locks, mutexes. We just asked bend to run our program on RTX, and
it did. Simple as that. (Note that, for now, Bend only supports 24-bit machine
ints (<code>u24</code>), thus, results are always <code>mod 2^24</code>. We plan to 64-bit numbers on
the upcoming weeks.)</p>
<p dir="auto">Bend isn't limited to a specific paradigm, like tensors or matrices. Any
concurrent system, from shaders to Erlang-like actor models can be emulated on
Bend. For example, to render images in real time, we could simply allocate an
immutable tree on each frame:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# given a shader, returns a square image
def render(depth, shader):
  bend d = 0, i = 0:
    when d < depth:
      color = (fork(d+1, i*2+0), fork(d+1, i*2+1))
    else:
      width = depth / 2
      color = demo_shader(i % width, i / width)
  return color

# given a position, returns a color
# for this demo, it just busy loops
def demo_shader(x, y):
  bend i = 0:
    when i < 5000:
      color = fork(i + 1)
    else:
      color = 0x000001
  return color

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><strong>Analysts at Zone.eu, one of the leading domain registrars and web hosting providers in Europe, have observed a vulnerability affecting the global e-mail ecosystem, stemming from unaddressed warnings in the DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) standard that puts billions of users in risk.</strong></p>



<p>This is not an issue in a particular software product but rather a vulnerability resulting from loose interpretations of the standard across numerous implementations that span the vast e-mail ecosystem.</p>



<p>Using this vulnerability, attackers can create forged emails that still pass DKIM’s cryptographic checks that can then be easily replayed to reach the intended victim. These bogus emails are likely to also pass DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance) policies. Significant amount of organisations worldwide expect DMARC to prevent certain types of phishing attacks both against themselves but also against their recipients.</p>



<p>The severity of this problem has significantly increased with the advent of BIMI (Brand Indicators for Message Identification). BIMI depends on DMARC to verify the authenticity of messages. As a result, if the message passes all these checks, some email services like for example Apple Mail and Gmail will display a brand logo, but this time next to a forged email. Users are instructed by the UI to trust BIMI-branded e-mails, making these modified letters especially legitimate-looking and trustworthy.</p>



<p>BIMI in Gmail and Apple Mail:<br><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="840" height="120" src="https://www.zone.eu/static/sites/2/2024/05/BIMI-examples1715952591.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.zone.eu/static/sites/2/2024/05/BIMI-examples1715952591.jpg 1355w, https://www.zone.eu/static/sites/2/2024/05/BIMI-examples1715952591-300x43.jpg 300w, https://www.zone.eu/static/sites/2/2024/05/BIMI-examples1715952591-1024x147.jpg 1024w, https://www.zone.eu/static/sites/2/2024/05/BIMI-examples1715952591-768x110.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px"></p>



<p>We have confirmed that these attacks are usable in practice by modifying DKIM-signed email messages sent by multiple Fortune 500 companies (among others), for whom email integrity is essential. The forged emails arrived in the victims’ inboxes without any difficulty until recently. Though considering the size of the ecosystem this weakness will linger for a while.</p>



<p>The importance of this issue must be recognized even if a sender or receiver has not implemented BIMI. This is a problem with DKIM, as these forgeries pass DKIM and DMARC. If phishing campaigns take advantage of this vulnerability, it can lead to a global increase in the risk of credentials and data being stolen. Hardening DKIM implementations against such attacks is critical on its own.</p>



<div>
<p>Google’s comment about this issue:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The risks identified in this research show why the DKIM length feature is not supported for Gmail senders. Given how interconnected the email ecosystem is, we encourage all email providers to follow this approach. We thank the researchers for drawing attention to this important issue.”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>


<h2 id="h-technical-synopsis">Technical synopsis</h2>


<p>The DKIM standard (RFC 6376) specifies a parameter for defining e-mail body length (“l=”); this tag informs the verifier of an e-mail message of the number of octets in the body of the received e-mail.</p>



<p>The risks of using the body length limit (“l=” tag) have been known at least since the DKIM standard was published (see <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6376#section-8.2">RFC 6376 section 8.2</a>), but the described security considerations are incomplete as it looks at the “l=” tag in isolation. Our approach is to find letters that have signatures with the “l=” tag and then to either modify an existing Content-Type header or to add a new one to then replace the displayed content.</p>



<p>In our tests, many senders that use the “l=” tag do not sign the Content-Type header, allowing the attacker to replace it with a specially crafted value without breaking the signature. Unfortunately even if the header is signed, it is usually not over-signed/double-signed to protect against adding an additional (unsigned) Content-Type header to the letter. How to handle multiple Content-Type headers in a single email message is not well-defined, and as such, implementations and resulting dangers differ.</p>



<p>Our approach to exploiting this weakness is replacing the boundary value in the Content-Type header in MIME multipart emails and adding a new MIME structure that uses the modified boundary at the end of the email. Such modification renders the existing MIME structure into a non-visible comment and forces the email client to treat the added structure as the “real” email content. This results in a larger impact and differs from other previously described approaches.</p>



<p>Simplified illustration of the described attack:</p>

This is a multi-part message

--abc

[Multipart Comment end]
--abc--[1234 byte cutoff]

Faked message MIME structure

--abc----</code></pre>
</div>
</div>



<p>It should be noted that the first line in this forged MIME structure is still signed, which would bypass simple checks against displaying unsigned content. Such an email still of course passes the signature check, but the client uses the appended MIME structure as the email content, completely ignoring the original content.</p>



<p>If the Content-Type header is part of the DKIM signature, adding an additional Content-Type still enables the vulnerability with many email clients.</p>



<p>Modified email content:</p>



<div>
<pre title="Modified email content"><code>DKIM-Signature: v=1; a=rsa-sha256; c=relaxed/relaxed;
  d=domain.com; l=1234; s=test;
  h=date:from:to:message-id:subject:mime-version:content-type;
  bh=kDDbMi...; b=K8S4Yk2XjoIvBh...
Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="def" &lt;-- prepended boundary
Content-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary="abc"</code></pre>
</div>



<p>The signature validation passes as only the bottom Content-Type value will be included in the signature. Still, the email client might use the topmost value when parsing the MIME structure, making the attack viable.</p>



<p>To mitigate this, the Content-Type header should be protected in the signature (must be added twice to the “h=” tag)</p>



<div>
<pre><code>  h=date:from:to:message-id:subject:mime-version:content-type:content-type;</code></pre>
</div>



<p>In this case, any additional Content-Type header added to the message would invalidate the DKIM signature. This does make the signature more fragile, but if the “l=” tag is to be used, this is better than alternatives.</p>





<p>This is not the first time someone has drawn attention to issues like these, but it has gotten significantly more serious. Similar attacks have been previously described by Stephen Ullrich (<a href="https://noxxi.de/research/breaking-dkim-on-purpose-and-by-chance.html">“Breaking DKIM – on Purpose and by Chance”</a>), and the team at Valimail (<a href="https://www.valimail.com/blog/breaking-dkim-or-simply-misunderstanding-how-it-works-in-practice/">“DKIM Fallacies: Debunking Rumors of DKIM’s Vulnerabilities”</a>). This issue can also probably be combined with other “reskin” attacks such as <a href="https://lutrasecurity.com/en/articles/kobold-letters/">Kobold letters</a>, making such malleability even more dangerous.</p>



<p>The issues with DKIM signatures do not end here. We have observed senders that only sign the first byte in the body with “l=1” (like for example Maropost), which is dangerous on its own. This is also one more reason DKIM assessors should ignore signatures using the “l=” tag.</p>



<p>The oldest malleable letter we have found (that still has the corresponding public key published) is from 2014 and was sent by Microsoft, in addition to the “l=” tag it also uses SHA1. Keys that have been used for RSA-SHA1 signatures should be discarded and the corresponding public keys removed from DNS. This further highlights the issues with extremely long-lived key material.</p>



<p>Unfortunately it’s not the only problem with old key material. A fair amount of senders still use poorly generated or weak 512-bit RSA keys. As desribed by Hanno Böck (<a href="https://16years.secvuln.info/">“16 years of CVE-2008-0166 – Debian OpenSSL Bug”</a>), 0.24% of Tranco’s Top 1 Million list still have weak Debian keys published, which is quite dangerous.</p>


<h2 id="h-practical-examples-and-impact">Practical examples and impact</h2>


<p>Analyzing our email traffic we’ve found multiple prominent examples such as tesla.com, trendmicro.com, bloomberg.net, dell.com, cisco.com, ups.com, dhl.com, ebay.com, panasonic.com, whirlpool.com, hilton.com, norton.com, avast.com, radissonhotels.com that have all sent malleable letters. We would say they’re valuable targets for making forgeries.</p>



<p>So far we have observed millions of DKIM signatures with the length tag, from 3040 different domains, of which 32 pass BIMI checks and have a valid VMC. This contradicts Valimail’s claim that “almost no senders today use the attribute.”</p>

<h2 id="h-mitigation">Mitigation</h2>


<p>The key to fixing this vulnerability and avoiding these attacks is already present in the DKIM standard section under “Security Considerations”: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6376#section-8.2">8.2. Misuse of Body Length Limits (“l=” Tag)</a>.</p>



<p>We quote: “To avoid this attack, Signers should be extremely wary of using this tag, and Assessors might wish to ignore signatures that use the tag.” This suggestion must be strictly interpreted, definitely more so than the current wording suggests. Initially at least in the context of BIMI, but ideally it should be completely ignored.</p>



<p>At the same time assessors should currently start rejecting letters with old DKIM signatures in order to mitigate misuse of old signatures, be it this attack or any similar ones. This should however be a temporary solution until the length tag and weak signatures (SHA1-RSA or ≤1024-bit keys) can be completely deprecated and ignored.</p>



<p>E-mail senders, especially those who have used the “l=” tag, should rotate their DKIM keys periodically. If this is not done, old e-mails containing the “l=” tag can still be used to create new forgeries. There are more reasons to rotate DKIM keys than just this vulnerability.</p>

</div>
<p>Beekeepers say New Zealand needs a new approach to a hive-destroying disease that is leaving those affected out of pocket, uncompensated and devastated.</p>
<p>Honey producer Springbank Honey of North Canterbury was ordered to burn more than 10,000 of its beehives and beekeeping equipment after American Foulbrood (AFB) was identified through spore testing.</p>
<p>AFB is a bacterial disease spread by spores that could be viable for up to 40 years. It is considered one of the <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/country/483881/increase-in-disease-for-beehives-concerning-as-more-than-3000-destroyed-in-one-year">most widespread and destructive honey bee brood diseases</a> in the world.</p>
<p>The family-owned honey business, operating near Rangiora in North Canterbury, runs 3000 organic beehives and processes honey too.</p>
<p>Co-owner Steven Brown said burning thousands of beehives over Mother's Day weekend had left the family "devastated".</p>
<p>"By next year, when we don't have boxes for our honey crop, we're probably going to be losing over $5-6 million," Brown said.</p>
<p>"The loss of the boxes is one thing, but without the boxes for the hives we won't have a honey crop."</p>


<p>Brown said it would cost around $2 million to replace it all, made more difficult by the fact that there was no compensation or insurance available for beekeepers.</p>
<p>Burning the hives was more painful when other countries used tools like vaccines, antibiotics and sterilisation - measures prohibited in New Zealand and in some export markets.</p>
<p>"Most farmers vaccinate their cows for diseases every single year, but it's illegal to vaccinate the hive," Brown said.</p>
<p>"I don't understand why we have our heads in the sand and live like it's 200 years ago without these amazing abilities of giving a vaccine and stopping disease; instead we burn things."</p>

<span itemprop="caption"> </span>

</p>
</div>
<p>The order to destroy the hives by fire came from the levy-run management agency that enforces the national pest management plan rules, including auditing beekeepers, monitoring for the disease and eliminating it.</p>
<p>Brown said the new government needed to "shut down immediately" the outdated pest management plan and the agency.</p>
<p>"The plan was supposed to reduce AFB by 5 percent per year, they haven't complied with that. It's gone rampant throughout New Zealand," he said.</p>
<p>"I want the Biosecurity Act changed, but the one we're operating under, the pest management plan, the [Biosecurity] Minister needs to stop that immediately."</p>

<h3>Agency aims for support</h3>
<p>But the management agency's general manager, Niha Long said it aimed to support beekeepers impacted by the disease.</p>
<p>She acknowledged how "upsetting" it would be for social media users to view the burning beehives - but burning was the only method at hand.</p>
<p>"The only way to destroy the spores is through burning, so we cannot use antibiotics unlike other countries in the world due to market access," Long said.</p>
<p>She said the agency was not there to make beekeepers' operations harder.</p>
<p>"We acknowledge that it is a significant impact on the beekeeper, but we're not here - contrary to popular belief - to make a beekeeper's life difficult," she said.</p>
<p>"We're here to work with the beekeeper and that is the nature of the relationship we've attempted to have with this beekeeper [Springbank Honey].</p>
<p>"AFB will happen if you're a beekeeper, at some point in your journey, and getting AFB is not the problem - what can be a problem for us is the beekeepers's action or inaction after you've found it."</p>
<div itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://media.rnztools.nz/rnz/image/upload/s--IjU0-JU6--/ar_16:10,c_fill,f_auto,g_auto,q_auto,w_1050/v1715797083/4KQ3RU0_bees3_jpg" width="1050" height="1312" alt="Springbank Honey hives destroyed - due to American Foulbrood . Beekeeper Steven Brown"></p><p>
<span itemprop="caption"> </span>
<span>Photo: <span itemprop="copyrightHolder">Facebook / Steven Brown</span></span>
</p>
</div>
<p>She said the law and the pest management plan put legal obligations on its registered, levy-paying beekeepers.</p>
<p>"It dictates each beekeeper's responsibility for eliminating AFB, so I'd like to emphasise that that is each beekeeper's responsibility through a set of legal obligations."</p>
<p>Long said fewer than eight percent of the country's 8000 beekeepers were currently affected - and there were 2900 reports of AFB made in the past year to May, down 15 percent on the 3449 reports the year before.</p>


<h3>NZ 'pretty much alone'</h3>
<p>NZ Beekeeping Incorporated president Jane Lorimer said New Zealand was "pretty much alone" in the response to burn hives and equipment on positive spore tests.</p>
<p>But she said beekeepers generally still followed the rules.</p>
<p>"Beekeepers have to notify and then destroy hives within seven days after finding the disease - and most beekeepers, including Steve, usually comply with that regulation.</p>
<p>"We're going to seek some clarification around the Biosecurity Act and the Pest Management plan and how the two legal aspects integrate."</p>
<p>It was seeking clarification around how the Biosecurity Act and the pest management plans' legal aspects integrated.</p>
<p>She said the government review into the legislation was an opportunity to improve transparency for the sector.</p>
<p>"We hope that the Minister will take into consideration our suggestions [in the review] and make changes accordingly. Part of that is an appeal process as well, there's nothing within the order in council about appealing what's happening when a beekeeper's asked to destroy equipment they've found spores in.</p>
<p>"This isn't the first case where beekeepers had been told to destroy beekeeping equipment that they'd found spores in."</p>
<p>Lorimer said it was <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/country/509715/beekeepers-deliver-stinging-response-to-apiculture-nz-plan">a difficult time for the industry</a>, and the number of commercial beehives had halved in the past two years.</p>

          <h2>Abstract</h2>
          <p>
              We propose <span>Toon3D</span>. In this work, we recover the underlying 3D
              structure of non-geometrically consistent scenes. We focus our analysis on hand-drawn images from cartoons
              and anime. Many cartoons are created by artists without a 3D rendering engine, which means that any new
              image of a scene is hand-drawn. The hand-drawn images are usually faithful representations of the world,
              but only in a qualitative sense, since it is difficult for humans to draw multiple perspectives of an
              object or scene 3D consistently. Nevertheless, people can easily perceive 3D scenes from inconsistent
              inputs! In this work, we correct for 2D drawing inconsistencies to recover a plausible 3D structure such
              that the newly warped drawings are consistent with each other. Our pipeline consists of a user-friendly
              annotation tool, camera pose estimation, and image deformation to recover a dense structure. Our method
              warps images to obey a perspective camera model, enabling our aligned results to be plugged into
              novel-view synthesis reconstruction methods to experience cartoons from viewpoints never drawn before.

              We first predict the depth of each image with <a href="https://github.com/prs-eth/Marigold">Marigold</a>
              and obtain candidate transient masks with <a href="https://segment-anything.com/">SAM</a>. We then label
              images with the <span>Toon3D
                Labeler</span> to obtain correspondences and mark transient regions. We optimize camera poses and warp
              images to obtain calibrated, perspective cameras. Finally, we can initialize Gaussians with the aligned
              dense point cloud and run refinement.

              rooms. In the first video, we show the point cloud &amp; cameras and our custom labeling interface. In the
              second video, you can scrub the slider to
              see a walkthrough inside the house! The closest camera's image is shown in the bottom right corner.</p>

          <h2>Sparse-View Reconstruction</h2>
          <p>
              We can reconstruct scenes from few images and with large
              viewpoint changes. Where COLMAP may fail, we can intervene with the <span>Toon3D
                Labeler</span> to obtain human-labeled correspondences. Here we show a
              fly-through rendering for two rooms ("Living room" and "Bedroom 2") of <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/833261990707199349">this Airbnb listing</a>.

          <h2>Visualizing Inconsistencies</h2>
          <p>
              Cartoons are hand-drawn so we need to warp the images to be 3D consistent. The first item is a video that
              shows the warp taking place during alignment optimization.
              The next two items are images which show the original and warped drawings, as well as the overlap between
              the two. Blurry
              regions indicate where a lot of warp occured.

              We can reconstruct paintings with <span>Toon3D</span> even though the paintings are
              hand-drawn. We predict the depth of each image, then align and warp point clouds. Finally we use Gaussian

            <span>Abstract:</span>Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely-used parameter-efficient finetuning method for large language models. LoRA saves memory by training only low rank perturbations to selected weight matrices. In this work, we compare the performance of LoRA and full finetuning on two target domains, programming and mathematics. We consider both the instruction finetuning ($\approx$100K prompt-response pairs) and continued pretraining ($\approx$10B unstructured tokens) data regimes. Our results show that, in most settings, LoRA substantially underperforms full finetuning. Nevertheless, LoRA exhibits a desirable form of regularization: it better maintains the base model's performance on tasks outside the target domain. We show that LoRA provides stronger regularization compared to common techniques such as weight decay and dropout; it also helps maintain more diverse generations. We show that full finetuning learns perturbations with a rank that is 10-100X greater than typical LoRA configurations, possibly explaining some of the reported gaps. We conclude by proposing best practices for finetuning with LoRA.

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>We all know that the value of pi is a constant with a particular immutable value. Anyone who has done any graphical programming also knows that visual rendering relies not just on pi but trigonometry more broadly as well as other mathematical techniques. If we look into the source code of the first person shooter Doom we find that the value of pi used in the game is wrong. In this talk I will explore what happens when we subtly and not so subtly break math in the source.</p>

<p>Doom is a well known classic first person shooter game with source code released under the GPL in 1999. In this talk I will begin by exploring what happens to the game when we make the value of pi even more wrong. What about when we change other trigonometric functions and constants to incorrect values? How will our familiar understanding and ability to traverse this virtual world change when we do this. Are there any interesting gaming possibilities with non-Euclidean geometries? A brief segway will cover some optimization tricks made to enable the game to run well on hardware available at the time. At the end I will provide a link to other games and public source code repositories that also use an incorrect value of pi. Pointers will also be provided to allow the audience to compile their own incorrect math version of the game.</p>

<p>This is the first time that big cat DNA has been found on a carcass in the UK. The analysis was carried out at a&nbsp;<a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/lifesci/research/archaeobotany/ecological_forensics/cats/">laboratory</a>&nbsp;at the University of Warwick run by Prof Robin Allaby.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Allaby told BBC Wildlife that it was very hard to lift DNA from swabs taken from carcasses but there was no doubt in this case.&nbsp;“It makes me a convert [to the existence of non-native big cats in the UK],”&nbsp;Allaby said.&nbsp;“Until now, I have remained open-minded, I think that’s my job as a scientist.”</p>

</ul>



<p>Allaby has previously identified a bit of a claw that was sent to him from someone who wished to remain anonymous from the north of England as also belong to a cat in the Panthera genus.</p>



<p>Allaby started up the testing service 12 years ago when a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.discoverwildlife.com/animal-facts/mammals/roe-deer-facts">roe deer</a> <a href="https://www.discoverwildlife.com/animal-facts/mammals/roe-deer-facts">carcass</a>&nbsp;that had been scavenged was discovered in a small valley near Stroud in Gloucestershire.&nbsp;“All we found on that one was<a href="https://www.countryfile.com/wildlife/mammals/fox-guide-behaviour-mating-diet-identification"> fox</a> [DNA], which are a really underestimated predator,”&nbsp;Allaby said.</p>



<p>In the most recent case, the <a href="https://www.countryfile.com/wildlife/mammals/native-british-sheep-breeds-and-how-to-recognise-them">sheep</a> carcass was discovered by Cumbrian resident Sharon Larkin-Snowden in an undisclosed upland location. Larkin-Snowden told Rick Minter’s&nbsp;<a href="https://bigcatconversations.com/ep110-panthera-cumbria-dna-developments/">Big Cat Conversations</a>&nbsp;podcast that she chanced across the dead sheep one morning in October last year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Larkin-Snowden said the carcass was fresh and that she had disturbed whatever had been feeding on, which she then saw running towards a stone wall before disappearing over it.</p>



<p>“I assumed at first it was a <a href="https://www.countryfile.com/animals/pets/the-life-of-a-border-collie-photographer-amy-bateman">sheepdog</a>, but then I did a double take and realised it was a black cat,”&nbsp;she said.&nbsp;“It was big&nbsp;–&nbsp;the size of a German shepherd dog.”</p>



<p>Rick Minter, who has received more than 1,000 reports of people’s encounters with <a href="https://www.discoverwildlife.com/animal-facts/mammals/facts-about-big-cats">big cats</a>, said the animal was most likely to have been a<a href="https://www.discoverwildlife.com/animal-facts/mammals/leopard-facts"> leopard.</a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="pagecontent">

<p>
Even relatively new C programmers have no trouble reading simple
C declarations such as
</p>

<pre><span>int      foo[5];     </span>// <i>foo is an array of 5 ints</i>
<span>char    *foo;        </span>// <i>foo is a pointer to char</i>
<span>double   foo();      </span>// <i>foo is a function returning a double</i>
</pre>

<p>
but as the declarations get a bit more involved, it's more difficult
to know exactly what you're looking at.
</p>

<pre><span>char *(*(**foo[][8])())[]; </span>// <i>huh ?????</i>
</pre>

<p>
It turns out that the rules for reading an arbitrarily-complex C variable
declaration are easily learned by even beginning programmers (though how
to actually <i>use</i> the variable so declared may be well out of reach).
</p>

<p>
This Tech Tip shows how to do it.
</p>

<h2 id="types">Basic and Derived Types</h2>

<p>
In addition to one variable name, a declaration is composed of one
"basic type" and zero or more "derived types", and it's crucial to
understand the distinction between them.
</p>

<p>
The complete list of basic types is:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tbody><tr>	<td> • <span>char</span>
	</td><td> • <span>signed char</span>
	</td><td> • <span>unsigned char</span>
	</td><td> &nbsp;	</td></tr>
<tr>	<td> • <span>short</span>
	</td><td> • <span>unsigned short</span>
	</td><td> &nbsp;
	</td><td> &nbsp;	</td></tr>
<tr>	<td> • <span>int</span>
	</td><td> • <span>unsigned int</span>
	</td><td> &nbsp;
	</td><td> &nbsp;	</td></tr>
<tr>	<td> • <span>long</span>
	</td><td> • <span>unsigned long</span>
	</td><td> &nbsp;
	</td><td> &nbsp;	</td></tr>
<tr>	<td> • <span>float</span>
	</td><td> • <span>double</span>
	</td><td> • <span>void</span>
	</td><td> &nbsp;	</td></tr>
<tr>	<td> • <span>struct <i>tag</i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</td><td> • <span>union <i>tag</i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</td><td> • <span>enum <i>tag</i></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</td><td> &nbsp;	</td></tr>

<tr>	<td> • <span>long long</span>
	</td><td> • <span>unsigned long long&nbsp;</span>
	</td><td> • <span>long double</span>
	</td><td> &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>ANSI/ISO C only</i>			</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>
A declaration can have exactly <b>one</b> basic type, and it's always on
the far left of the expression.
</p>

<p>
The "basic types" are augmented with "derived types", and C has
three of them:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<b>* &nbsp; pointer to...</b>
</dt>
<dd>This is denoted by the familiar <b>*</b> character, and it should be
self evident that a pointer always has to point <b><i>to</i></b> something.
</dd>

<dt>
<b>[] &nbsp; array of...</b>
</dt>
<dd>"Array of" can be undimensioned -- <b>[]</b> -- or dimensioned -- <b>[10]</b> --
but the sizes don't really play significantly into reading a declaration.
We typically include the size in the description. It should be clear
that arrays have to be "arrays <b><i>of</i></b>" something.
</dd>

<dt>
<b>() &nbsp; function returning...</b>
</dt>
<dd>
This is usually denoted by a pair of parentheses together - <b>()</b> -
though it's also possible to find a prototype parameter list inside.
Parameters lists (if present) don't really play into reading a
declaration, and we typically ignore them. We'll note that parens
used to represent "function returning" are different than those
used for grouping: grouping parens <i>surround</i> the variable name,
while "function returning" parens are always on the right.
</dd>

<dd>
Functions are meaningless unless they <i>return</i> something (and we
accommodate the <b>void</b> type by waving the hand and pretend that
it's "returning" void).
</dd>

</dl>

<p>
A derived type <i>always</i> modifies something that follows, whether it be
the basic type or another derived type, and to make a declaration read
properly one must always include the preposition ("to", "of", "returning").
Saying "pointer" instead of "pointer to" will make your declarations fall
apart.
</p>

<p>
It's possible that a type expression may have no derived types (e.g.,
<span><b>"int i"</b></span> describes "i is an int"), or it can have
many. Interpreting the derived types is usually the sticking point when
reading a complex declaration, but this is resolved with operator
precedence in the next section.
</p>

<h2>Operator Precedence</h2>

<p>
Almost every C programmer is familiar with the operator precedence
tables, which give rules that say (for instance) multiply and divide
have higher precedence than ("are preformed before") addition or subtraction,
and parentheses can be used to alter the grouping.
This seems natural for "normal" expressions, but the same rules do
indeed apply to declarations - they are <i>type</i> expressions rather
than <i>computational</i> ones.
</p>

<p>
The "array of" <b>[]</b> and "function returning" <b>()</b> type operators
have higher precedence than "pointer to" <b>*</b>, and this leads to some
fairly straightforward rules for decoding.
</p>

<p>
<i>Always</i> start with the variable name:
</p>

<blockquote>
<b>foo is</b> ...
</blockquote>

<p>
and <i>always</i> end with the basic type:
</p>

<blockquote>
foo is ... <b>int</b>
</blockquote>

<p>
The "filling in the middle" part is usually the trickier part, but it
can be summarize with this rule:
</p>

<blockquote>
"go right when you can, go left when you must"
</blockquote>

<p>
Working your way out from the variable name, honor the precedence rules
and consume derived-type tokens to the right as far as possible without
bumping into a grouping parenthesis. Then go left to the matching paren.
</p>

<h2>A simple example</h2>

<p>
We'll start with a simple example:
</p>

<pre><span>long **foo[7];</span>
</pre>

<p>
We'll approach this systematically, focusing on just one or two small
part as we develop the description in English. As we do it, we'll
show the focus of our attention in <span>red</span>,
and <strike>strike out</strike> the parts we've finished with.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<span>long</span> **<span>foo</span> [7];
</dt>
<dd>
Start with the variable name and end with the basic type:
</dd>
<dd>
<span>foo is</span> ... <span>long</span>
</dd>

<dt>
<span>long</span> ** <span>foo</span><span>[7]</span>;
</dt>

<dd>At this point, the variable name is touching two derived types:
"array of 7" and "pointer to", and the rule is to go right when you can,
so in this case we consume the "array of 7"
</dd>

<dd>
<span>foo is</span>
<span>array of 7</span>
...
<span>long</span>
</dd>

<dt>
<span>long</span> *<span>*</span> <span>foo[7]</span>;
</dt>
<dd>Now we've gone as far right as possible, so the innermost part
is only touching the "pointer to" - consume it.
</dd>

<dd>
<span>foo is</span>
<span>array of 7</span>
<span>pointer to</span>
...
<span>long</span>
</dd>

<dt>
<span>long</span>
<span>*</span>
<span>*foo[7]</span>;
</dt>
<dd>
The innermost part is now only touching a "pointer to", so consume it also.
</dd>

<dd>
<span>foo is</span>
<span>array of 7</span>
<span>pointer to</span>
<span>pointer to</span>
<span>long</span>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
This completes the declaration!
</p>

<h2>A hairy example</h2>

<p>
To really test our skills, we'll try a very complex declaration that very
well may never appear in real life (indeed: we're hard-pressed to think
of how this could actually be used). But it shows that the rules scale
to very complex declarations.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<span>char</span> *(*(**<span>foo</span> [][8])())[];
</dt>
<dd>
All declaration start out this way: "variable name is .... basictype"
</dd>
<dd>
<span>foo is</span> ... <span>char</span>
</dd>

<dt>
<span>char</span> *(*(**<span>foo</span><span>[]</span> [8])())[];
</dt>
<dd>
The innermost part touches "array of" and "pointer to" - go right.
</dd>
<dd>
<span>foo is</span>
<span>array of </span>
...
<span>char</span>
</dd>

<dt>
<span>char</span> *(*(**<span>foo[]</span><span>[8]</span>)())[];
</dt>
<dd>
It's common in a declaration to alternate right and left, but this is not the
rule: the rule is to go as far right as we can, and here we find that the innermost
part still touches "array of" and "pointer to". Again, go right.
</dd>
<dd>
<span>foo is</span>
<span>array of </span>
<span>array of 8</span>
...
<span>char</span>
</dd>

<dt>
<span>char</span> *(*(*<span>*</span> <span>foo[][8]</span>)())[];
</dt>
<dd>
Now we've hit parenthesis used for grouping, and this halts our march to the right.
So we have to backtrack to collect all the parts to the left (but only as far as
the paren). This consumes the "pointer to":
</dd>

<dd>
<span>foo is</span>
<span>array of</span>
<span>array of 8</span>
<span>pointer to</span>
...
<span>char</span>
</dd>

<dt>
<span>char</span> *(*(<span>*</span> <span>*foo[][8]</span>)())[];
</dt>
<dd>
Again we are backtracking to the left, so we consume the next "pointer to":
</dd>

<dd>
<span>foo is</span>
<span>array of</span>
<span>array of 8</span>
<span>pointer to</span>
<span>pointer to</span>
...
<span>char</span>
</dd>

<dt>
<span>char</span> *(*<span>(**foo[][8])</span><span>()</span>)[];
</dt>
<dd>
After consuming the "pointer to" in the previous step, this finished off the
entire parenthesized subexpression, so we "consume" the parens too. This
leaves the innermost part touching "function returning" on the right, and
"pointer to" on the left - go right:
</dd>

<dd>
<span>foo is</span>
<span>array of</span>
<span>array of 8</span>
<span>pointer to</span>
<span>pointer to</span>
<span>function returning</span>
...
<span>char</span>
</dd>

<dt>
<span>char</span> *(<span>*</span> <span>(**foo[][8])()</span> )[];
</dt>
<dd>
Again we hit grouping parenthesis, so backtrack to the left:
</dd>

<dd>
<span>foo is</span>
<span>array of</span>
<span>array of 8</span>
<span>pointer to</span>
<span>pointer to</span>
<span>function returning</span>
<span>pointer to</span>
...
<span>char</span>
</dd>

<dt>
<span>char</span> * <span>(*(**foo[][8])())</span><span>[]</span>;
</dt>
<dd>
Consuming the grouping parentheses, we then find that the innermost part is
touching "array of" on the right, and "pointer to" on the left. Go right:
</dd>

<dd>
<span>foo is</span>
<span>array of</span>
<span>array of 8</span>
<span>pointer to</span>
<span>pointer to</span>
<span>function returning</span>
<span>pointer to</span>
<span>array of</span>
...
<span>char</span>
</dd>

<dt>
<span>char</span> <span>*</span> <span>(*(**foo[][8])())[]</span>;
</dt>
<dd>
Finally we're left with only "pointer to" on the left: consume it to
finish the declaration.
</dd>

<dd>
<span>foo is</span>
<span>array of</span>
<span>array of 8</span>
<span>pointer to</span>
<span>pointer to</span>
<span>function returning</span>
<span>pointer to</span>
<span>array of</span>
<span>pointer to</span>
<span>char</span>
</dd>
</dl>


<p>
We have no idea how this variable is useful, but at least we can
describe the type correctly.
</p>

<p>
Note that example won't compile unless it's <u>initialized</u> to provide the dimension of the innermost array,
though none of this changes the fact that nobody would ever <i>actually</i> use this for anything:
</p>

<pre>
// explicit initialization
char *(*(**foo[][8])())[] <b>= { 0 };</b>

// implicit init from function call

<b>void myfunction(</b>char *(*(**foo[][8])())[]<b>)</b>
{
	...
}
</pre>

<h2>Abstract Declarators</h2>

<p>
The C standard describes an "abstract declarator", which is used when a
type needs to be described but not associated with a variable name. These
occur in two places -- casts, and as arguments to <b>sizeof</b> -- and they
can look intimidating:
</p>

<blockquote>
<span>int (*(*)())()</span>
</blockquote>

<p>
To the obvious question of "where does one start?", the answer is
"find where the variable name would go, then treat it like a normal
declaration".  There is only one place where a variable name could
possibly go, and locating it is actually straightforward. Using the
syntax rules, we know that:
</p>

<ul>
<li>to the right of all the "pointer to" derived type tokens
</li><li>to the left of all "array of" derived type tokens
</li><li>to the left of all "function returning" derived type tokens
</li><li>inside all the grouping parentheses
</li></ul>

<p>
Looking at the example, we see that the rightmost "pointer to" sets
one boundary, and the leftmost "function returning" sets another one:
</p>

<blockquote>
<span>
<span>int (*(*</span><span> • ) • </span><span>())()</span>
</span>
</blockquote>

<p>
The red • indicators show the only two places that could possibly hold
the variable name, but the leftmost one is the only one that fits the
"inside the grouping parens" rule. This gives us our declaration as:
</p>

<blockquote>
<span>int (*(*foo)())()</span>
</blockquote>

<p>
which our "normal" rules describe as:
</p>

<blockquote>
<b>foo is a pointer to function returning pointer to function returning int</b>
</blockquote>

<h2>Semantic restrictions/notes</h2>

<p>
Not all combinations of derived types are allowed, and it's possible
to create a declaration that perfectly follows the syntax rules but is
nevertheless not legal in C (e.g., <i>syntactically</i> valid but
<i>semantically</i> invalid). We'll touch on them here.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Can't have arrays of functions
</dt>
<dd>Use "array of pointer to function returning..." instead.
</dd>

<dt>Functions can't return functions
</dt>
<dd>Use "function returning pointer to function returning..." instead.
</dd>

<dt>Functions can't return arrays
</dt>
<dd>Use "function returning pointer to array of..." instead.
</dd>

<dt>In arrays, only the leftmost [] can be undimensioned
</dt>
<dd>C supports multi-dimensional arrays (e.g.,
<span><b>char foo[1][2][3][4]</b></span>), though in practice
this often suggests poor data structuring. Nevertheless, when there
is more than one array dimension, only the leftmost one is allowed to
be empty.
<span><b>char foo[]</b></span> and
<span><b>char foo[][5]</b></span> are legal, but
<span><b>char foo[5][]</b></span>
is not.
</dd>

<dt>"void" type is restricted
</dt>
<dd>
Since <b>void</b> is a special pseudo-type, a variable with this basic type is
only legal with a final derived type of "pointer to" or "function returning".
It's not legal to have "array of void" or to declare a variable of just
type "void" without any derived types.
</dd>

<dd>
<pre><b>void *foo;</b>            // legal
<b>void foo();</b>           // legal
<b>void foo;</b>             // not legal
<b>void foo[];</b>           // not legal
</pre>
</dd>

</dl>

<h2>Adding calling-convention types </h2>

<p>
On the Windows platform, it's common to decorate a function declaration
with an indication of its <i>calling convention</i>. These tell the compiler
which mechanism should be used to call the function in question, and the
method used to call the function <em>must</em> be the same one which the
function expects. They look like:
</p>

<pre>extern int <b>__cdecl</b> main(int argc, char **argv);

extern BOOL <b>__stdcall</b> DrvQueryDriverInfo(DWORD dwMode, PVOID pBuffer,
                              DWORD cbBuf, PDWORD pcbNeeded);
</pre>

<p>
These decorations are very common in Win32 development, and are
straightforward enough to understand. More information can be found
in <a href="http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/win32-callconv.html">Unixwiz.net
Tech Tip: Using Win32 calling conventions</a>
</p>

<p>
Where it gets somewhat more tricky is when the calling convention
must be incorporated into a pointer (including via a typedef), because
the tag doesn't seem to fit into the normal scheme of things. These
are often used (for instance) when dealing with the <b>LoadLibrary()</b>
and <b>GetProcAddress()</b> API calls to call a function from a freshly-loaded
DLL.
</p>

<p>
We commonly see this with typedefs:
</p>

<pre>typedef BOOL (<b>__stdcall</b> *PFNDRVQUERYDRIVERINFO)(
    DWORD   dwMode,
    PVOID   pBuffer,
    DWORD   cbBuf,
    PDWORD  pcbNeeded
    );

...

/* get the function address from the DLL */
pfnDrvQueryDriverInfo = (PFNDRVRQUERYDRIVERINFO)
	GetProcAddress(hDll, "DrvQueryDriverInfo")
</pre>

<p>
The calling convention is an attribute of the <i>function</i>,
not the <i>pointer</i>, so in the usual reading puts it after
the pointer but inside the grouping parenthesis:
</p>

<blockquote>
BOOL (<b>__stdcall</b> *foo)(...);
</blockquote>

<p>
is read as:
</p>

<blockquote>
foo is a pointer <br>
to a __stdcall function <br>
returning BOOL.
</blockquote>

<!--
<h1>"const" and "volatile"</h1>

These type qualifiers add a complication because they can apply to
either the basic type or the derived type.

<ul>
<li>If the qualifier is directly before or directly after the basic type,
it modifies the basic type, so these two are identical:

<pre class="codeblock">
int const ...;
const int ...;
</pre>

<li>
These qualifiers are otherwise consumed and read where they are found.
</ul>
-->

Broadband services are a wonderful innovation of our time, using multiple frequency&nbsp;<i>bands</i>&nbsp;(hence the name) to carry signals over wires (usually copper, sometimes aluminium). One of the key aspects of the technology is its ability to adapt to the length and characteristics of the <i>line</i>&nbsp;on which it is deployed.</p><p>

We have seen faults on broadband circuits that manifest as the system adapting to much lower speeds, this is a key factor as a service can work, but unusually slowly, over very bad lines.</p><p>

It has always been said that ADSL will work over a bit of wet string.</p><p>

<p>
So, there you go, ADSL over 2m of literal "wet string". Well done all for testing this. It shows the importance of handling faults that seem to just be "low speed".</p><p>

As a bonus, fit tin cans to both ends and you get voice as well as broadband on the same wet string!

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>“America can’t build anything,” my co-worker, a talented data scientist from China, remarked as we rode a BART train through a suburb of Oakland. She was humored by the contrast of ultra-modern subways and dense apartments in Chengdu with the 1960s stucco houses and the Apollo 11-era BART metro system of the Bay Area. The mayor of San Francisco had a similar thought on </span><a href="https://sfstandard.com/2024/04/16/san-francisco-london-breed-china-shenzhen-yimby/" rel="">her recent trip to China</a><span>, marveling at the infrastructure built within a few years. We hear it a million times in American media: our infrastructure sucks. It takes too long to build a single home in most cities and $1.7 million to build a bathroom in San Francisco. Four stations on a mere six-mile VTA-led BART extension through mostly suburban San Jose will cost as much as $12 billion, more than double the annual war budget of Iran.</span></p><p>The culprit is many factors, but much of them originate with urban renewal — the aggressive bulldozing and re-development programs that peaked in the 1950s and 1960s. Ramped up by the Eisenhower Administration, aggressive public policy used infrastructure like freeways and property development to bulldoze low-income areas. The impacts persist to this day: the destruction of Black middle-class urban neighborhoods, vacant lots in once-thriving districts, the erasure of historic districts, the masses of jumbled freeways, and the mass migration of people out of cities.</p><p>Most stated urban renewal goals were total failures. Intending to revitalize business in the city core, most redevelopment projects were failures at attracting and sustaining private investment in cities, with a few exceptions. Intending to remove their Black population, urban renewal depressed property values and kept these neighborhoods majority Black, though depopulated and poorer. Urban renewal did convince most Americans that the government was incapable of delivering public projects. It had successfully frightened minorities that the government would usurp their lands and target them. It had convinced the white middle class that government programs were mostly tax-wasting, destructive projects and fueled the tax revolt of the 1970s.</p><p>The backlash to how urban renewal was conducted primarily blamed its top-down approach to urban planning. Federal and state bureaucrats from neighborhoods far away from areas they lived made radical decisions about people’s neighborhoods without their input. Post-urban renewal, major planning and consulting decisions were given to private, tax-exempt companies a.k.a. not-for-profits. By the 1980s and 1990s, a cottage industry of inner-city nonprofits acting as community middlemen emerged to do that job. Private companies had already been contracted as consultants and contractors for public development during urban renewal. Now, major planning aspects of public development are directly influenced by private organizations, which aren’t inherently democratic. Rather than building up cost-effective public capacity, public funds go to private companies to manage decisions and outreach.</p><p>Accompanying this change was the ballooning of public process and veto points, often in the name of “bottom-up” planning. In my opinion, the accurate takeaway from urban renewal was not that the government lacked checks and balances in public development, as is often told. Many affluent and middle-class neighborhoods were spared from bulldozers with very little resistance. Ugly freeways sprawled throughout Oakland yet ceased at the Berkeley border because Berkeley’s local government listened to its wealthier homeowners and vetoed the city’s freeway project. Oakland City Council did not care about its mostly poorer populace and invited freeways in with comparatively less fuss.</p><p>Urban renewal wasn’t as top-down as people say. The routing of freeways and public project placements were often determined by municipalities and states, not federal officials, and they chose targets like minority neighborhoods. Rather than recognizing that representation in government gave way to the destruction of neighborhoods, a myth has emerged that there weren’t enough meetings. These urban renewal projects were deliberated on for years or enshrined in local master plans decades prior— always without the explicit participation or solicitation of poor communities.</p><p><span>Today, publicly funded projects have an excessive number of meetings where very little if anything is accomplished in defense of the project, yet every meeting presents an opportunity to veto the project. Nor have equitable outcomes been achieved. Though not called “urban renewal” anymore, freeway construction and widening projects </span><a href="https://www.planetizen.com/news/2023/07/124895-new-highways-are-still-tearing-communities-apart" rel="">continue to ravage</a><span> disproportionately ethnic minority and lower-income neighborhoods in 2024.</span></p><p><span>The public outreach process tends to </span><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/k4kzph3ynal3xai/ZoningParticipation_Perspectives_Final.pdf?e=1&amp;dl=0" rel="">heavily benefit older, retired, wealthier and home-owning resident</a><span>s that can go to city hall regularly. Holding more meetings doesn’t increase equitable outcomes, rather it gives that constituency more chances to veto a project. Working people and parents with under-aged kids often can’t spend time at city hall, waiting for hours before commenting on projects that may benefit or harm them. Excessive hearings significantly increase the cost of all projects because salaries must be paid to officials and consultants for every minor adjustment, both in the government and private sector.</span></p><p>Another failed attempt at reform was environmental law. The biggest mistake that early environmental advocacy made in the 1970s was suggesting that simply being opposed to development was environmentally friendly. Today, modern climate science understands that’s incorrect, but our laws treat carbon-reduction projects as equivalent to any net-carbon increase project. Bus lanes that would take cars off the road go through extremely costly and years-long environmental review. Same for infill housing or green energy projects, which can cost hundreds of thousands in review and permitting alone.</p><p>Environmental law often also fails to distinguish between existing uses predating these laws and new uses meant to combat them. The most glaring example would be California High-Speed Rail, which would provide tremendous carbon-reduction benefits on a crowded highway and air corridor. Yet because of the California Environmental Quality Act and the federal National Environmental Policy Act, high speed rail has been delayed by decades of litigation, obstruction and study. Yet the existing West Coast crowded airline corridor, suburban sprawl, and highways built before these laws came into effect cannot have the laws used against them. Even though their emissions grew beyond their initial projections and high-speed rail would reduce them.</p><p><span>Our entire approach to land-use is both insanely slow and produces carbon-intensive outcomes through status quoism, all thanks to urban renewal’s trauma. In Vienna, Austria their public housing developments are influenced and customized by local community boards, but they can not prohibit housing. Unlike the U.S. where zoning dictates what you can do with your property, zoning in Japan dictates what you </span><em>can’t </em><span>do with property. Infrastructure can be delivered quicker there, as land use focuses on regulating against harm rather than micro-managing all possible uses. The latter leads to cities like Half Moon Bay, California, </span><a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/05/15/half-moon-bay-planning-commission-reluctantly-oks-senior-farmworker-housing-with-conditions/" rel="">dictating and downsize housing </a><span>for low income farm workers who recently suffered a mass shooting, because the concerns of neighbors supersede the welfare of the public at large.</span></p><p>As frustrating as it is to wait 30 years for California High-Speed rail to finish, it's the punishment we pay for never truly atoning for the harm urban renewal did, and precisely how it did it. We live in a fantasy world where all government projects and development done efficiently come at the material cost of communities, rather than the truth which is that urban renewal was meant to destroy, not improve neighborhoods. It’s hard to envision a future where we’ll have good infrastructure in the United States.</p><p><span>For all the gags and bewilderment of American media in the late 2000s made about “Chinese Ghost Cities”, most of those cities are now well occupied. The Chinese government correctly predicted population growth and built cities ahead of time, although not in the most efficient manner. The United States ignored our bustling population needs because we can’t plan or build cities anymore, and within 10 years we went from a housing bubble to a housing shortage where rent is the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/10/business/housing-rent-inflation-cpi.html" rel="">primary cause of national inflation</a><span>. U.S. cities barely plan for the future anymore and don’t have any extravagant ideas about how they’ll need to grow. </span></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Digital communications systems always represent a collection of design trade-offs. Maximising one characteristic of a system may impair others, and various communications services may chose to optimise different performance parameters based on the intersection these design decisions with the physical characteristics of the communications medium. In this article I’ll look at the Starlink service [1], and how TCP, the workhorse transport protocol of the Internet, interacts with the characteristics of the Starlink service.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2024-05/starlink-tcp-fig1.png"><img src="https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2024-05/starlink-tcp-fig1.png" width="40%"></a><br>Figure 1 – Orbiting Bodies from Newton’s Principia Mathematica</p>
<p>To start, its useful to recall a small item of Newtonian physics from 1687 [2]. On the surface of the earth if you fire a projectile horizontally it will fall back to earth due to the combination of the effects of the friction from the earth’s atmosphere and the earth’s gravitational force. However, assuming that the earth has no friction-inducing atmosphere, then if you fire this projectile horizontally fast enough it will not return to the earth, but head into space. If you are high enough to clear various mountains that may be in the way, there is, however, a critical velocity where the projectile will be captured by the earth’s gravity and neither fall to ground nor head out into space (Figure 1).</p>
<p>This orbital velocity at the surface of the earth is some 40,320 km/sec. The orbital velocity decreases with altitude, and at an altitude of 35,786 km above the surface of the earth the orbital velocity of the projectile relative to a point on the surface of the spinning earth is 0 km/sec. This is the altitude of a geosynchronous equatorial orbit, where the orbiting object appears to sit at a fixed location in the sky.</p>
<h3>Geosynchronous Services</h3>
<p>Geosynchronous satellites were the favoured approach for the first wave of satellite-based communications services. Each satellite could “cover” an entire hemisphere. If the satellite was on the equatorial plane, then it was at a fixed location in the sky with respect to the earth, allowing the use of large antenna. These antennas were able to operate at a low signal to noise ratio, allowing the signal modulation to use an encoding with a high density of discrete phase amplitude points, which lifted the capacity of the service.</p>
<p>All this must be offset against the less favourable aspects of a geosynchronous service. Consideration of crosstalk interference between adjacent satellites in geosynchronous orbits using the same radio frequencies resulted in international agreements that require a 2° spacing for geosynchronous satellites that use the same frequency, so this orbital slot is a limited resource that is limited to just 180 spacecraft if they all use K band (18 – 27Ghz) radio systems. At any point on the earth there is an upper bound to the signal capacity that can be received (and sent) using geosynchronous services.</p>
<p>Depending on whether the observer is on the equator directly beneath the satellite, or further away from this point, a geosynchronous orbit satellite is between 35,760 and 42,664 km away, so a signal round trip time to the geosynchronous satellite and back will between 238ms and 284ms in terms of signal propagation time. In IP terms, that’s a round trip time of between 477 and 569ms and to this needs to be added the signal encoding and decoding times. In addition, there is a delay for the signal to be passed between the terrestrial end points and the satellite earth stations. In practice, a round trip time of around two thirds of a second (660ms) for Internet paths that include a geosynchronous satellite service is a common experience.</p>
<p>This extended latency means that the endpoints need to use large buffers to hold a copy of all the unacknowledged data, as is required by the TCP protocol. TCP is a feedback-governed governed protocol, using ACK pacing. The longer the round time the greater the lag in feedback, and the slower the response from end points to congestion or to available capacity. The congestion considerations lead to the common use of large buffers in the systems driving the satellite circuits which can further exacerbate congestion-induced instability. In geosynchronous service contexts, individual TCP sessions are more prone to instability and experience longer recovery times following low events as compared to their terrestrial counterparts, when such counterparts exist [3].</p>
<h3>Low Earth Orbit Systems</h3>
<p>A potential response to the drawbacks of geosynchronous satellites is to bring the satellite closer to earth. This approach has several benefits. The earth’s spinning iron core generates a magnetic field, which traps energetic charged solar particles and redirects them through what is called the “Van Allen Belt”, thus deflecting solar radiation. Not only does this allow the earth to retain its atmosphere, but it also protects the electronics of orbiting satellites that use an orbital altitude below 2,000 km or so from the worst effects of solar radiation (such as the recent solar storms). It’s also far cheaper to launch satellites into a low earth orbit, and these days SpaceX is able to do so using re-usable rocket boosters.</p>
<p>The reduced distance between the earth and the orbiting satellite reduces the latency in sending a signal to the satellite and back which can improve the efficiency of the end-to-end packet transport protocols that include such satellite circuits.</p>
<p>This group of orbital altitudes, from some 160km to 2,000km, are collectively termed <i>Low Earth Orbit</i> (or LEOs) [4]. The objective here is to keep the satellite’s orbit high enough to prevent it slowing down by grazing the upper parts of the earth’s ionosphere, but not so high that it loses the radiation protection afforded by the Inner Van Allen belt [5]. At a height of 550km, the minimum signal propagation delay to reach the satellite and back from the surface of the earth is just 3.7ms.</p>
<p>But all of this comes with some different issues. At a height of 550km an orbiting satellite can only be seen by a small part of the earth. If the minimum effective elevation to establish communication is 25 degrees of elevation above the horizon, then the satellite’s footprint is a circle with a radius of 940km, or a circle of area 2M km2. (Lower angles of elevation are possible but the longer the path segment through the earth’s atmosphere decreases the signal to noise ratio, compromising the available signal capacity as well as increasing the total path delay.) To provide continuous service to any point on the earth’s surface (510.1M km2) the minimum number of orbiting satellites is 500. This use of a constellation of satellites implies that a LEO satellite-based service is not a simple case of sending a signal to a fixed point in the sky and having that single satellite mirror that signal down to some other earth location. A continuous LEO satellite service needs to hop across a continual sequence of satellites as they pass overhead and switch the virtual circuit path across to successive satellites as they come into view of both the end user and the user’s designated earth station.</p>
<p>At the altitude of 550 km, an orbiting satellite is moving with a relative speed of 27,000 km/hour relative to a point on the earth’s surface and passes across the sky from horizon to horizon in under 5 minutes. This has some implications for the design of the radio component of the service. If the satellite constellation is large enough, then the satellites are close enough to each other that there is no need to use larger dish antennae that require some mechanised steering arrangement that tracks individual satellites in their path across the sky, but this itself it not without its downside. An individual signal carrier might be initially acquired as a weak signal (in relative terms), increases in strength as the satellite’s radio transponder and the earth antenna move into alignment, and weakens again as the satellite moves on. Starlink’s antennae use a phased array arrangement using a grid of smaller antennae on a planar surface. This allows the antenna to be electronically steered by altering the phase difference between each of the antennae in the grid. Even so, this is a relatively coarse arrangement, so the signal quality is not consistent. This implies a constantly varying Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) as the phased array antenna tracks each satellite during its overhead path.</p>
<p>It appears that Starlink services use dynamic channel rate control as a response to this constantly varying SNR. The transmitter constantly adjusts the modulation and coding scheme to match the current SNR, as described in the IEEE 802.11ac standard. The modulation of this signal uses adaptive phase amplitude modulation, and as the SNR improves the modulator can use a larger number of discrete code points in this phase amplitude space, thus increasing the effective capacity of the service while using a constant frequency carrier signal. What this implies is that the satellite service is attempting to operate at peak carriage efficiency, and to achieve this the transmitter constantly adapts its signal modulation to take advantage of the instantaneous SNR from the satellite system. To the upper layer protocol drivers, the transmission service appears to have a constantly varying channel capacity and latency. </p>
<p>The Starlink satellite’s Ku-band downlink has a total of 8 <i>channels</i> using frequency division multiplexing. Each channel has an analogue bandwidth of 240Mhz. Each channel is broken into <i>frames</i>, which is subdivided using time division multiplexing into 302 intervals, each of 4.4µs, which together with a frame guard interval makes each frame 1,333µs, or 750 frames per second. Each frame contains a header that contains satellite, channel and modulation information [6]. The implication is that there is a contention delay of up to 1.3ms assuming that each active user is assigned at least one interval per frame.</p>
<p>This leaves us with four major contributory factors for variability of the capacity of the Starlink service, namely:</p><ul>
<li>the variance in signal modulation capability, which is a direct outcome of the varying SNR of the signal,</li><li>the variance in the satellite path latency due to the relative motion of the satellite and the earth antennae,</li><li>the need to perform satellite switching on a regular basis, and</li><li>the variability induced by sharing the common satellite transmission medium with other users, which results in slot contention.</li></ul>
<p>One way to see how these variability factors impacts on the service characteristics is to use a capacity measurement tool to measure the service capacity on a regular basis. The results of such a capacity measurement test in a Starlink service are shown in Figure 2. Here the test is a SpeedTest measurement test [7], performed on a 4-hourly basis for the period August 2023 through March 2024. The service appears to have a median value of around 120Mbps of download capacity, with individual measurements reading as high as 370Mbps and as low as 10Mbps, and 15Mbps of upload capacity, with variance of between 5Mbps to 50Mbps.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2024-05/starlink-tcp-fig2.png"><img src="https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2024-05/starlink-tcp-fig2.png" width="80%"></a><br>Figure 2 – Starlink Performance</p>
<p>In Internet terms <i>ping</i> [8] is a very old tool, but at the same time it’s still a very useful tool, which probably explains its longevity. Figure 3 is a plot of a continuous (flood) ping across a Starlink connection from the customer side terminal to the first IP end point behind the Starlink earth station for a 380 second interval. (A “flooding” ping sends a new ping packet each time a packet is received from the remote end).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2024-05/starlink-tcp-fig3.png"><img src="https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2024-05/starlink-tcp-fig3.png" width="80%"></a><br>Figure 3 – Starlink Ping Profile</p>
<p>The first major characteristic that is visible in this ping data is that the minimum latency changes regularly every 15 seconds. It appears that this change correlates to the Starlink user’s terminal being assigned to a different satellite. That implies that the user equipment “tracks” each satellite for a 15 second interval, which corresponds to a tracking angle of 11 degrees of arc.</p>
<p>The second characteristic is that loss events are seen to occur at times of switchover between satellites, as well as occurring less frequently as a result of either obstruction, signal quality or congestion.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2024-05/starlink-tcp-fig4.png"><img src="https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2024-05/starlink-tcp-fig4.png" width="80%"></a><br>Figure 4 – Starlink Ping Profile showing satellite handover</p>
<p>The third is that there is a major increase in latency at the point when the user is assigned to a different spacecraft. The worst case in this data set is a shift from 30ms to 80ms.</p>
<p>Finally, within each 15s satellite tracking interval the latency variation is relatively high. The average variation of jitter between successive RTT intervals is 6.7ms. The latency spikes at handover impose an additional 30ms to 50ms indicating the presence of deep buffers in the system to accommodate the transient issues associated with satellite handover. To illustrate this link behaviour the ping data set has been filterred to remove the effects of the satellite assignment at second 283 and second 298.  (Figure 5).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2024-05/starlink-tcp-fig5.png"><img src="https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2024-05/starlink-tcp-fig5.png" width="80%"></a><br>Figure 5 – Starlink Ping Profile showing latency variance</p>
<p>The overall packet loss rate, when measuring using 1-second paced pings over an extended period is a little over 1% as a long-term average loss rate.</p>
<h3>TCP Protocol Performance</h3>
<p>TCP [9] is an instance of a sliding window positive acknowledgement protocol. The sender maintains a local copy of all data that has been passed into the local system’s IP layer and will only discard that local copy of sent data when it has received a positive acknowledgement from the receiver.</p>
<p>Variants to TCP are based on the variations in the sender’s control of the rate of passing data into the network and variations in the response to data loss. The classic version of TCP is one that uses a linear inflation of the sending window size while there is no loss, and halves this window in response to packet loss. This is the RENO TCP control algorithm. Its use in today’s Internet has been largely supplanted by the CUBIC TCP control algorithm [10] which uses a varying window inflation rate that attempts to stabilise the sending rate at a level just below the build-up of network queues (which ultimately leads to packet loss). </p>
<p>In general terms there is a small set of common assumptions about the characteristics of the network path for such TCP control algorithms:
</p><li>There is a <i>stable</i> maximal capacity of the path, where the term stability describes a situation where the available path capacity is relatively constant across a number of RTT intervals.</li><li>The amount of <i>jitter</i> (variation in end-to-end delay) is low in proportion to the RTT.</li><li>&gt;The average <i>packet loss rate</i> is low. In the case of congestion-based loss TCP control algorithms packet loss is generally interpreted by the algorithm as a sign that the network’s buffers have filled, and loss is an indication of buffer overflow.
<p>Obviously, as we’ve noted, the first two conditions do not necessarily hold for end-to-end paths that include a Starlink component. The loss profile is also different. There is the potential for congestion-induced packet loss, as is the case in any non-synchronous packet switched medium, but there is an additional loss component that can occur during satellite handover, and a further loss component that can be caused by other impairments imposed upon the radio signal.</p>
<p>TCP typically tends to react to such environments by using conservative choices.</p>
<p>The RTT estimate is a smoothed average value of RTT measurements, to which is added the mean deviation of individual measurements from this average. For Starlink, with its relatively high level of individual variance in RTT measurements this means that the TCP sender may operate with a RTT estimate that is higher than the minimum RTT, which may result in a sending rate that is lower than the available end-to-end capacity of the system.</p>
<p>The occurrence of non-congestion-based packet loss can also detract from TCP performance. Conventionally, loss will cause the sender to quickly reduce its sending window, on the basis that if this loss is caused by network buffer overflow, then the sender needs to allow these buffers to drain, and then it will resume sending as a lower rate, which should restore coherency of the feedback control loop.</p>
<p>How does this work in practice?</p>
<p>Figure 6 shows a detailed view of a TCP cubic session over a Starlink circuit. The initial 2 seconds shows the <i>slow start</i> TCP sending rate inflation behaviour, where the sending window doubles in size for each RTT interval, reaching a peak of 240Mbps in 2 seconds. The sender then switches to a mode of rapid reduction of the sending window in the next second, dropping its sending rate to 50Mbps within one second. At this point the CUBIC <i>congestion avoidance</i> phase appears to kick in, and the sending rate increases to 70Mbps over the ensuing 5 seconds. There is a single loss event which cases the sending rate to drop in second 8 back to 40Mbps. The remainder of the trace shows this same behaviour of slow sending rate inflation and intermittent rate reductions which is typical of CUBIC.</p>
<p>This CUBIC session managed an average transfer rate of some 45Mbps, which is well below the peak notional circuit capacity of some 250Mps, as indicated by SpeedTest.</p>

<p>Starlink is a shared medium, and the performance of the system in local times of light use (off peak) is significantly different to performance in peak times. Figure 7 shows CUBIC performance profile during an off-peak time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2024-05/starlink-tcp-fig7.png"><img src="https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2024-05/starlink-tcp-fig7.png" width="80%"></a><br>Figure 7 – TCP CUBIC over Starlink – Off-Peak</p>
<p>The difference between the achievable throughput between peak and off-peak is quite significant, with the off-peak performance reaching a throughput level some 3 – 4 times greater than the peak load performance. The slow-start phase increases the throughput to some 200Mbps within the first second. The flow then oscillated for a second, then started a more stable congestion avoidance behaviour by second 4. The cubic window inflation behaviour is visible up to second 12 and then the flow oscillates around some 200Mbps of throughput for the remainder of the session.</p>
<p>Is the difference between these two profiles in Figures 6 and 7 a result of active flow management by Starlink equipment, or the result of the way in which CUBIC reaches a flow equilibrium with other concurrent flows?</p>
<p>We can attempt to answer this question by using a different TCP control protocol which has a completely different response to contention with other concurrent flows.</p>
<p>The Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time (BBR) protocol [11] is a TCP congestion control algorithm developed at Google a decade or so ago. BBR attempts to position the TCP flow at the onset of network queue formation, rather than oscillating between full and empty queue states (as is the case in most loss-based TCP congestion control algorithms).</p> 
<p>Briefly, BBR makes an initial estimate of the delay-bandwidth product of the network path, and then drives the sender to send at this rate for 6 successive RTT intervals. It performs repair for dropped packets without adjusting its sending rate. The 7th RTT interval sees the sending rate increase by 25% and the end-to-end delay is carefully measured in this interval. The final RTT interval in the cycle sees the sending rate drop by 25% from the original rate, intended to drain any network queues that may have formed in the previous RTT interval. If the end-to-end delay increased in the sending rate inflated interval the original sending rate is maintained. If the increased sending window did not impact the end-to-end delay, then this indicates that the network path has further capacity and the delay-bandwidth estimate is increased for the next 8-RTT cycle. (There have been a couple of subsequent revisions to the BBR protocol, but in this case, I’m using the original (v1) version of BBR.)</p>
<p>The results of a Starlink performance test using BBR is shown in Figure 8.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2024-05/starlink-tcp-fig8.png"><img src="https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2024-05/starlink-tcp-fig8.png" width="80%"></a><br>Figure 8 – TCP BBR over Starlink</p>
<p>In this case BBR has made an initial estimate of some 250Mbps for the path bandwidth. This was estimate appears to have been revised at second 14 to some 350Mbps, and then dropped to some 200Mbps some 15 seconds later for the final 10 seconds of this test. It is likely that these changes are the result of BBR responding to satellite handover in Starlink, and the variance in latency was interpreted by BBR as a sign of queue formation, or the absence of queue of queue formation, which was used to alter BBR’s bandwidth delay estimate for the link.</p>
<p>The same BBR test was performed in an off-peak time, which a very similar outcome (Figure 9).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2024-05/starlink-tcp-fig9.png"><img src="https://www.potaroo.net/ispcol/2024-05/starlink-tcp-fig9.png" width="80%"></a><br>Figure 9 – TCP BBR over Starlink – Off-Peak</p>
<p>If BBR is sensitive to changes in latency, and latency is so variable in Starlink, then why does BBR perform so well as compared to CUBIC?</p>
<p>I suspect that here BBR is not taking a single latency measurement, but measuring the round-trip time for all packets that are sent in this 7th RTT interval once the sender has increased its sending rate to the burst rate and uses the minimum RTT value as the ‘loaded’ RTT value to determine whether to perform a send rate adjustment. As long as the minimum RTT levels are consistent, and, as shown in Figure 3, these minimum values appear to be consistent across each 15 second scheduling interval, then BBR will assume that its sending rate is not causing network queue formation and will maintain its sending rate.</p>
<h3>Protocol Tuning for Starlink</h3>
<p>Starlink provides a somewhat unique data link service. It has a very high jitter rate, a packet drop rate of around 1%-2% that is unrelated to network congestion, and a latency profile that jumps on a regular basis every 15 seconds. From the perspective if the TCP protocol, Starlink represents an unusually hostile link environment, and older variants of TCP, such as Reno TCP, that react quickly to packet loss and recover slowly, can perform very poorly when used across Starlink connections.</p>
<p>Could you tune a variant of TCP to optimise its performance over a path that includes a Starlink component?</p>
<p>A promising approach would appear to start with a variant of BBR. The reason for the choice of BBR is its ability to maintain its sending rate in the face of individual packet loss events. If one were to optimise BBR for Starlink then it can be noted that Starlink performs a satellite handover at regular 15 second intervals, and if the regular sending rate inflation in BBR occurs at the same time as scheduled satellite handover, the BBR sender could defer its rate inflation, maintaining its current sending rate across the scheduled handover time.</p>
<p>The issue with BBR is that, for version 1 of this protocol, it is quite aggressive in claiming network resources, which can starve other non BBR TCP concurrent sessions of capacity. One possible response is to use the same 15-second satellite handover timer with version 3 of the BBR protocol, which is intended to be less aggressive when working with concurrent data flows.</p>
<p>In theory it would be possible to adjust CUBIC in a similar manner, performing a lost packet repair using Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) [11] if the packet loss occurred at the time of a scheduled satellite handover. While CUBIC is a fairer protocol with respect to sharing the path capacity with other concurrent TCP sessions, it tends to react conservatively when faced with high jitter paths (as is the case when the end-to-end path includes a Starlink component). Even with some sensitivity to scheduled satellite handovers CUBIC is still prone to reduced efficiency in the use of network resources.</p>
<p>A somewhat different approach could utilise Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) [12]. The advantage of such an approach is that it allows the TCP session to differentiate the case where a high sending rate it causes the formation of network queues (congestion), while a transient event, such as satellite handover, causes packet loss without network queue formation. ECN can permit a flow control behaviour that is very much like BBR.</p> 
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>While earlier TCP control protocols, such as Reno, have been observed to perform poorly on Starlink connections, more recent TCP counterparts, such as CUBIC, perform more efficiently. The major TCP feature that makes these protocols viable in Starlink contexts is the use of Selective Acknowledgement [11], that allows the TCP control algorithm to distinguish between isolated packet loss and loss-inducing levels of network congestion.</p>
<p>TCP control protocols that attempt to detect the onset of network queue formation can do so using end-to-end techniques by detecting changes in end-to-end latency during intermittent periods of burst, such as BBR. These protocols need to operate with a careful implementation of their sensitivity to latency, as the highly unstable short-term latency seen on Starlink connections, coupled with the 15-second coarse level latency shifts have the potential to confuse the queue onset detection algorithm.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to observe the behaviour of an ECN-aware TCP protocol behaviour if ECN were to enabled on Starlink routing devices. ECN has the potential to provide a clear signal to the endpoints about the onset of network-level queue formation, as distinct from latency variation.</p>

Its windows reset every day at midnight—but midnight according to <em>what time zone</em>? A standard fixed window might reset its counter according to your server’s midnight or a standard timezone offset such as UTC. A user in a different timezone who just ran out of requests might retry just after midnight and be surprised if the limit hasn’t been lifted—since to them, it is a new calendar day.</p><p>For these applications, you need to offset your window starts according to the user’s time zone, which has some potential for abuse as users can manually adjust their timezone once they’ve run out of requests to gain up to 1 full window of additional requests. Worse yet, users traveling West to East might incorrectly have more requests limited while those traveling East to West might incorrectly have more requests allowed as they effectively extend their day. If a rate limit resets based on local midnight and a user moves to an earlier time zone, they encounter earlier local midnights. This can effectively allow them to reset their request count sooner by being in a new “day” earlier than expected, thus potentially increasing their total allowable requests within a 24-hour period as measured by real time. Yikes. And we still haven’t dealt with DST.</p><p>This use case is already a bit of a tangent, so for now I’ll leave it at this: handling time zones correctly, accounting for users relocating as well as daylight savings, is difficult to get right—so if you’re considering going down that painful path, I’ll just <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2532729/daylight-saving-time-and-time-zone-best-practices/3269325#3269325">point</a> <a href="https://www.creativedeletion.com/2015/01/28/falsehoods-programmers-date-time-zones.html">you</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5wpm-gesOY">to</a> <a href="https://2ality.com/2021/06/temporal-api.html#time-zones-vs.-time-offsets">these</a> <a href="https://tech.bluesmoon.info/2013/08/dont-guess-at-timezones-in-javascript.html">resources</a> instead.

For example, set the <code>refillRate</code> equal to the <code>limit</code> and you have an equivalent to a fixed window rate limiter with a user-defined start.</p><astro-island client="only" component-export="TokenBucketFixedWindowComparison" component-url="/_astro/_RatelimitVisualization.DcnAx07u.js" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;TokenBucketFixedWindowComparison&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;solid-js&quot;}" props="{}" renderer-url="/_astro/client._0k3YFAT.js" ssr="" uid="Zkq4VK"></astro-island></li></ul><h2 id="other-considerations">Other considerations</h2><p>If you decide to add rate limiting to your application or endpoint, in addition to selecting an appropriate algorithm there are a few other things you should keep in mind.</p><ul><li><strong>Create a persisted store for the rate limiter.</strong> If you ever intend to horizontally scale your server (or even just restart it) your rate limiter data store can’t be in-memory. A popular option is to save rate limiting data to a key-value store like Redis, which has built-in functions for expiring keys, on a separate machine from your application. You can, however, use an ephemeral in-memory cache to block requests without hitting Redis while the limiter is hot.</li><li><strong>Fail open.</strong> If your server’s connection to the persisted store fails, make sure to allow all requests rather than blocking access to your service altogether.</li><li><strong>Optionally throttle bursts.</strong> Throttling can be used in combination with rate limiting to reduce the impact of burst traffic.</li><li><strong>Choose sensible keys.</strong> In general, rate limiting is done on a per-user level. For most apps, this means keying on the user ID. For APIs, key on an API key. To rate limit unauthenticated users, the options aren’t great, but popular methods include using the request’s IP address, a device fingerprint, a unique installation ID, or just a shared limiter.</li><li><strong>Surface useful rate limiting errors.</strong> Let users know how long they have to wait for their next request. For APIs, use the 429 HTTP status code when a request is blocked and include the relevant <code>x-ratelimit-*</code> response headers. <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28#checking-the-status-of-your-rate-limit">GitHub</a> has good examples of the headers for their fixed-window limiter and <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits/rate-limits-in-headers">OpenAI</a> has some for their token-bucket limiter.</li></ul><h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2><ul><li>If you need a simple rate limiter or predictable window start times, use a <a href="#fixed-windows">fixed window</a>.</li><li>If you need traffic smoothing for a high volume of requests, consider using an <a href="#sliding-windows">approximated sliding window</a>.</li><li>If you need to support bursts of traffic while enforcing a lower average long-term rate for requests, use a <a href="#token-buckets">token bucket</a>.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="playground">Playground</h2><astro-island client="only" component-export="Playground" component-url="/_astro/_RatelimitVisualization.DcnAx07u.js" opts="{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Playground&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;solid-js&quot;}" props="{}" renderer-url="/_astro/client._0k3YFAT.js" ssr="" uid="gojb2"></astro-island><hr><p><em>This post was inspired by the amazing load balancing visualizations at <a href="https://samwho.dev/load-balancing/">samwho.dev</a>.

<p>This eBay auction, spotted by <a href="https://social.pixels.pizza/@pixel/112389259975924778">Eric Vitiello</a>, immediately caught my eye:</p>

<p>Wow. <strong>Someone was selling Apple Employee #10’s employee badge?!</strong> What an incredible piece of Apple history! Sure, it’s not Steve Jobs’ badge (despite the auction title), but there are only so many of these in the world —&nbsp;especially from one of the first ten employees.</p>



<p>I persistently pored through the provided pictures.</p>

<p>At first, it looked good. The plastic was scuffed with age, the tape on the map was yellowed, the logo was correct, Sherry Livingston really was Employee #10.</p>



<p>But, that map — it felt a little off. (“Tennis courts?”) And I couldn’t stop looking at the “typewritten” part…</p>

<p>This badge would’ve been (obviously!) made before desktop publishing. A badge template would’ve been printed by a local printing company, then fed into a typewriter to type the individual employee details. <strong>And that typed text is way, way cleaner than any typewriter I’ve seen.</strong></p>



<p>And just as I was beginning to 🧐, along came Chris:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“That’s…&nbsp;fake. Both of them.” </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Oh snap. <strong>It’s really fake?</strong></p>



<p>What does this Chris guy know, anyway? Well, he’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Espinosa">Chris Espinosa.</a> Who just so happens to be <strong>Apple Employee #8.</strong></p>



<p><em>(Trivia: <a href="https://electricpig.co.uk/2011/02/24/apples-longest-serving-employee-not-steve-jobs/">he joined the company when he was 14… and still works there!</a>)</em></p>



<p>And we know <em>exactly</em> what Chris’ badge looked like:</p>

<p>I asked Chris <em>(who I truly admire!)</em> for more thoughts:</p>



<center></center>



<p>So, yeah. <strong>One of the most qualified people on planet earth to say this is a fake, is saying this is a fake.</strong></p>



<p>I had no choice at this point. <strong>I simply had to meddle.</strong></p>

<p>From…&nbsp;the German Red Cross?! How specific!</p>



<p>It seems like the German Red Cross runs a kind of second hand/charity shop, so ok, sure. But why would the German Red Cross have the employee badge for Apple Employee #10?</p>

<p>I couldn’t wait. The seller sent the Red “Croos” proof just a few hours later. (Enough time to… create it?)</p>

<p>At first blush, again, this provenance looks pretty good, right? A German purchase receipt, dated 2001, for the item pictured. The right logo. A nice emboss. Seems plausible.</p>



<p>But, again again, I had a weird feeling — this series of photos was trying <em>too hard.</em> That binder labelled “BILLS 200[0]—2010”, conveniently flipped upside down for casual authenticity? Why would you put that in these photos unless you were trying a bit too hard to make your case? It felt like a set dresser trying to stage a movie scene.</p>



<p>The seller added:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As you can see, the invoice is expressed in the old German currency, the German mark, before the entry of the EURO in the years following.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>No way. A regular human wouldn’t point this out. Someone proud of a detail they thought of in their forgery <em>would</em> point this out. This little detail would’ve been <em>far</em> more effective for me to discover on my own. </p>



<p>It was time to totally close the case. <strong>It was time to engage the internet.</strong></p>



<p>The Mastodon response from Germans was swift and brutal.</p>



<center></center>



<center></center>



<center></center>



<p>There was no doubt. <strong>This “proof” was yet another forgery.</strong></p>



<p><strong>I told the seller this.</strong> And then, weirdly, for the amount of effort put into this, they made a very dumb error:</p>

<p><strong>…yes, the item sold before I could finish this post.</strong> So, my sincere apologies to whoever out there just spent $946.00 on a total (but interesting!) work of fiction.</p>



<p>Here are the key takeaways from our meeting today:</p>



<ul>
<li>Beware of fraudulent pieces of Apple history</li>



<li>Don’t buy anything from this particular seller</li>



<li>When in doubt, Engage The Internet®</li>
</ul>



<p>Best,<br>Cabel</p>



<p>PS: I hope you’re having a nice week</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://slack.com/trust/data-management/privacy-principles?nojsmode=1">https://slack.com/trust/data-management/privacy-principles?nojsmode=1</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40383978">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Our mission is to build a product that makes work life simpler, more pleasant and more productive. Our guiding principle as we build this product is that the privacy and security of Customer Data is sacrosanct, as detailed in our <a href="https://slack.com/trust/privacy/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>, <a href="https://slack.com/trust/security">Security Documentation</a> and <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/content/dam/web/en_us/www/documents/legal/misc/slack-security-privacy-and-architecture.pdf">SPARC</a> and the <a href="https://slack.com/main-services-agreement">Slack Terms</a>.</p><p>Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are useful tools that we use in limited ways to enhance our product mission. To develop AI/ML models, our systems analyze Customer Data (e.g. messages, content, and files) submitted to Slack as well as Other Information (including usage information) as defined in our <a href="https://slack.com/trust/privacy/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> and in your customer agreement. To ensure the privacy and security of Customer Data in this particular context, we have a few guiding principles:</p><ul><li><strong>Data will not leak across workspaces. </strong> For any model that will be used broadly across all of our customers, we do not build or train these models in such a way that they could learn, memorize, or be able to reproduce some part of Customer Data. </li><li><strong>We have technical controls in place to prevent access. </strong>When developing AI/ML models or otherwise analyzing Customer Data, Slack can’t access the underlying content. We have various technical measures preventing this from occurring. Please read our <a href="https://a.slack-edge.com/964df/marketing/downloads/security/Security_White_Paper_2020.pdf">Security White Paper</a> for more info on these controls that protect the confidentiality and security of Customer Data.</li><li><strong>We offer Customers a choice around these practices. </strong> If you want to exclude your Customer Data from helping train Slack global models, you can opt out. If you opt out, Customer Data on your workspace will only be used to improve the experience on your own workspace and you will still enjoy all of the benefits of our globally trained AI/ML models without contributing to the underlying models. </li></ul><p><strong>Contact us to opt out. </strong> If you want to exclude your Customer Data from Slack global models, you can opt out. To opt out, please have your Org or Workspace Owners or Primary Owner contact our Customer Experience team at feedback@slack.com with your Workspace/Org URL and the subject line “Slack Global model opt-out request.” We will process your request and respond once the opt out has been completed. </p><h2>Customer Data and Other Information</h2><h4>How Slack may use Customer Data (e.g. messages, content, files) and Other Information to update our services</h4><p> Working from the above principles, here are a few examples of improvements and privacy protective techniques that our product and analytics teams may use to develop, update and improve Slack: </p><ul><li><strong>Channel Recommendations: </strong>We may use insights to recommend that a user joins a new public channel in their company. We make these suggestions based on channel membership, activity, and topic overlaps. Our model learns from previous suggestions and whether or not a user joins the channel we recommend. We protect privacy while doing so by separating our model from Customer Data. We use external models (not trained on Slack messages) to evaluate topic similarity, outputting numerical scores. Our global model only makes recommendations based on these numerical scores and non-Customer Data. For more technical details, please visit our Engineering Blog to <a href="https://slack.engineering/recommend-api/">learn more</a>.</li><li><strong>Search Results: </strong>Our search machine learning models help users find what they're seeking by identifying the right results for a particular query. We do this based on historical search results and previous engagements without learning from the underlying text of the search query, result, or proxy. Simply put, our model can't reconstruct the search query or result. Instead, it learns from team-specific, contextual information like the number of times a message has been clicked in a search or an overlap in the number of words in the query and recommended message.</li><li><strong>Autocomplete: </strong>Slack might make suggestions to complete search queries or other text– for example autocompleting the phrase "Customer Support" after a user types the first several letters of this phrase. These suggestions are local and sourced from common public message phrases in the user’s workspace. Our algorithm that picks from potential suggestions is trained globally on previously suggested and accepted completions. We protect data privacy by using rules to score the similarity between the typed text and suggestion in various ways, including only using the numerical scores and counts of past interactions in the algorithm.</li><li><strong>Emoji Suggestion: </strong>Slack might suggest emoji reactions to messages using the content and sentiment of the message, the historic usage of the emoji, and the frequency of use of the emoji on the team in various contexts. For instance, if 🎉 is a common reaction to celebratory messages in a particular channel, we will suggest users react to new, similarly positive messages with 🎉. To do this while protecting Customer Data, we might use an etrnal model (not trained on Slack messages) to classify the sentiment of the message. Our model would then suggest an emoji only considering the frequency with which a particular emoji has been associated with messages of that sentiment in that workspace.</li></ul><p>These types of thoughtful personalizations and improvements are only possible if we study and understand how our users interact with Slack.</p><p>Slack takes privacy seriously and our confidentiality obligations described in our customer agreements and <a href="https://slack.com/trust/privacy/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> apply in each of these scenarios. Customers own their own Customer Data. Slack aggregates and disassociates Customer Data such that Slack’s use of Customer Data to update the Services will never identify any of our customers or individuals as the source of any of these improvements to any third party, other than to Slack’s affiliates or sub-processors.</p></div></div>]]></description>
