<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you don’t know who Mark Dawson is, he’s a self-published author who has 203,722 ratings on Goodreads. He says himself that his books have had over 6 million downloads (including both paid and free promotional copies). He runs the Self Publishing Formula course and podcast, he talks at the 20BooksTo50K conference in Vegas, and he’s part of a new initiative called Fuse Publishing. He’s a pretty big deal in self-publishing, so what he does reflects on self-publishing as a whole.</p>

<p>I was wondering how this guy published so many books in so little time and I found my answer: he stole a lot of his material.</p>

<ul>
<li>[2013 William Boyd interviews James Bond by William Boyd from the Guardian] “the gaudy harlequinade of youth much in evidence”</li>
<li>[2014 The Driver by Mark Dawson] “The harlequinade of youth much in evidence”</li>
</ul>

<p>​</p>

<ul>
<li>[2013 William Boyd interviews James Bond by William Boyd from the Guardian] “the dark-eyed girls in their short dresses and the long-haired young men in crushed velvet and fur-trimmed Afghans"</li>
<li>[2014 The Driver by Mark Dawson] “Long-haired young men in vintage suits and fur-trimmed Afghans, and girls in short dresses”</li>
</ul>

<p>​</p>

<ul>
<li>[2012 <em>Annecy shootings: On a steep forest road, few signs of the horror that was</em> by John Lichfield for the Independent] “The misty slopes of the massif of the Montagne de Charbon tower above the treeline”</li>
<li>[2013 The Cleaner by Mark Dawson] “The misty slopes of the massif of the Montagne de Charbon stretched above the treeline”</li>
</ul>

<p>​</p>

<ul>
<li>[2009 I, Sniper: A Bob Lee Swagger Novel by Stephen Hunter] “He settled in, feeling the tension in the trigger, finding his stock weld, sliding to the eyepiece, and seeing the world through the mil-dot-rich reticle…”</li>
<li>[2014 Tarantula by Mark Dawson] “The man settled behind the rifle. He felt the tension in the trigger, found his stockweld and slid up to the eyepiece, staring into it and seeing the ridge and the trees and the vegetation through the mil-dot-rich reticle.”</li>
</ul>

<p>​</p>

<ul>
<li>[2009 I, Sniper: A Bob Lee Swagger Novel by Stephen Hunter] ”Then pulling out his Kestral 4000 weather station and noting the wind, humidity, and temperature.”</li>
<li>[2014 Tarantula by Mark Dawson] “Took out a small weather station and noted the wind, the humidity, and temperature.”</li>
</ul>

<p>​</p>

<ul>
<li>[2009 I, Sniper: A Bob Lee Swagger Novel by Stephen Hunter] “He dialed the first into the scope of the rifle, clicking mostly elevation but some windage, for there was a drift of light wind that rustled undulations in the grass.</li>
<li>[2014 Tarantula by Mark Dawson] “The trees were rustling a little in a light breeze that was running in off the sea […] He dialled the first into the scope of the rifle, making adjustments for windage.”</li>
</ul>

<p>​</p>

<ul>
<li>[2009 I, Sniper: A Bob Lee Swagger Novel by Stephen Hunter]  “… the smell of the cleaning fluid, the touch of hand to comb, cheek to fiberglass, finger to trigger”</li>
<li>[2014 Tarantula by Mark Dawson] “… the smell of the cleaning fluid that had been used on its metallic parts, the cold touch of the aluminum eyepiece against his eye socket. He felt the chill of the fibreglass stock against his cheek.”</li>
</ul>

<p>​</p>

<ul>
<li>[2010 Amexica: War Along the Borderline by Ed Vulliamy] “We pass the iron girder skeleton of a building that never seems to get finished”</li>
<li>[2013 Saint Death Mark Dawson] “Milton passed the iron girder skeleton of a building”</li>
</ul>

<p>​</p>

<ul>
<li>[2010 Amexica: War Along the Borderline by Ed Vulliamy] “little shops, outlets for cocaine, marijuana, synthetic drugs, and heroin—which in Juarez are called picaderos, usually marked by a shoe tied to a nearby telegraph wire”</li>
<li>[2013 Saint Death Mark Dawson] “Milton knew about Juarez […] Illicit outlets—picaderos—were marked out by shoes slung over nearby telegraph wires, and their shifty proprietors sold whatever illicit substance you needed to get high”</li>
</ul>

<p>​</p>

<ul>
<li>An older version of Saint Death said “Illicit outlets––picaderos––were marked out by shoes slung over nearby telegraph wires and their shifty proprietors sold cocaine, marijuana, synthetic drugs and heroin. The legitimate marketplace at Cerrajeros was busy with custom, a broad sweep of unwanted bric-a-brac for sale: discarded furniture, soda fountains, hair curlers, Kelvinator fridges.” but he changed it. So it was even more plagiarized before. You can look it up in Google and it’ll show up, though it leads to a weird scam site which will try to convince you that you have a virus on your computer but I still think that counts as proof as I’m assuming the scam site simply copied an older version of his book verbatim before he sent out an update through Kindle to cover up his more blatant plagiarism.</li>
<li>This also matches up to another passage from Amexica: “… lines the streets in overload quantities: sixties furniture, soda fountains, hair curlers, Kelvinator cookers and Osterizer blenders…” So Mark changed sixties furniture to discarded furniture and Kelvinator cookers to Kelvinator fridges. Nice.</li>
</ul>

<p>And I found all this in an hour or two, just looking at a few of his books, and only looking at the first few pages which were available for free in the Kindle sample and typing suspicious sentences into Google. He’s probably plagiarized a lot more and hidden it with after-the-fact edits and rearranging words in a way that’s harder to check using a search engine.</p>

<p>Basic rule: read through one of his books and type any phrase that seems either interesting and profound or technical about matters he’s not familiar with like guns into Google in quotes. You’ll probably find that he took it from somewhere else.</p>

<p>“Harlequins of youth much in evidence?” Never heard that sentence before. Oh, he didn’t write it.</p>

<p>“Fur-trimmed Afghans?” What are those? Oh, he probably doesn’t know either. Because he didn’t write it.</p>

<p>“Misty slopes of the massif” “Mil-dot-rich reticle” “iron girder skeleton of a building” etc.</p>

<p>For original prose you get clunky purple prose like “the sun glared down, a myriad of shafts that lanced into his eyes.” I mean, a myriad of shafts sounds like you’re talking about golf clubs or genitals. I would HOPE neither of those are lancing you in the eye.</p>

<p>It seems unfair that he’s reportedly sold 6 million books and is so involved in these groups while heavily plagiarizing when books like <em>How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild, and Got a Life</em> get cancelled entirely for plagiarism. But maybe in self-publishing things just work differently. But I feel like an author who sells 6 million books should be held to a higher standard whether they’re self-published or not.</p>

<p>(If this was not the right sub to post something like this, then I apologize and I'll take it down. I just thought more people should know about this because it seems like most of his fans have no idea he plagiarizes.)</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>EDIT: A previous of this version incorrectly stated that Mark Dawson wrote 20 books in 2 years. This was based on a cursory look of his Wikipedia page, where it seems to suggest he published 20 books (meaning both novels and novellas) from 2013 to 2015. However, it has been brought to my attention that many people took 'book' to mean full-length novel, not novella, and that a lot of these books had either been written previously and were just now being published, or had listed co-authors. So 20 novels and novellas with his name on them were published between 2013 and 2015 according to his Wikipedia bibliography, but that doesn't mean he necessarily wrote 20 books in 2 years. Apologies for any misinformation.</p>

<p>Hopefully after that blunder I still have some credibility.</p>

<p>EDIT 2: I’ve now reached out to Vox, Forbes, the New York Times, the Guardian, and CBS News with tips.</p>

<p>Some people were also telling me to reach out to various YouTubers and internet personalities to see if they were interested in tweeting about it or investigating it further, but many of them have their Twitter DMs closed and only have brand emails for emailing about sponsorships and such which are only read by a third party. So if you would like to see them talk about this and you know better ways to contact them, feel free to send it their way.</p>

<p>But for now I’m going to focus less on getting the word out and more on finding new examples of plagiarism within Mark Dawson’s other books.</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>EDIT 3: It seems I've found another source of inspiration.</p>

<ul>
<li>“tree allees, expansive lawns, follies, knot gardens, boxwood parterres” [<a href="http://www.marxdesign.com/TheMorganEstate/exterior.html">http://www.marxdesign.com/TheMorganEstate/exterior.html</a>]</li>
<li>“tree allées, expansive lawns, follies, knot gardens, and boxwood parterres” [The Driver by Mark Dawson (62% of sample on Kindle)]</li>
</ul>

<p>If you look up even the shortened form “tree allées, expansive lawns” only the article and The Driver appear. Doesn't seem like a coincidence to me. The website is copyrighted for 2013, while The Driver came out in January 4, 2014, according to Goodreads. Mark does noticeably fix the spelling of allées though, so that’s nice.</p>

<p>EDIT 4: He really likes the Morgan Estate apparently.</p>

<ul>
<li>“A majestic wrought iron gate brought in from a Southern plantation” [<a href="http://www.marxdesign.com/TheMorganEstate/">http://www.marxdesign.com/TheMorganEstate/</a>] (again copyrighted for 2013)</li>
<li>“a majestic wrought-iron gate that looked like it belonged on a Southern plantation” [The Driver by Mark Dawson (60% of sample)]</li>
</ul>

<p>EDIT 5:</p>

<ul>
<li>[A quote by Stephen Thomas Erlewine which is available from many sources including the All Music Guide: The Definitive Guide to Popular Music from 2001, page 396; notably, this is also the bio for the band on iHeart] “Suede kick-started the Brit pop revolution of the '90s, bringing English indie pop/rock music away from the swirling layers of shoegazing and dance-pop fusions of Madchester, and reinstating such conventions of British pop as mystique and the three-minute single.”</li>
<li>[The Driver by Mark Dawson, 2014, 69% of sample (nice)] “He liked the swirling layers of shoegazing and dance-pop fusions from the Madchester era and the sharp, clean three-minute singles that had evolved out of it. Suede and Sleeper and Blur.”</li>
</ul>

<p>“Swirling layers of shoegazing and dance-pop fusions” is a pretty generic phrase though, don’t you think? Could definitely just be a coincidence.</p>

<p>EDIT 6:</p>

<ul>
<li>[Page 169 of Mayfair Magazine October 2013] “oak parquetry floor, inlaid with ebony wood, with a gilded fireplace from a palazzo near Florence, Italy, no less.”</li>
<li>[77% of sample of The Driver, published in 2014] “oak parquetry floor inlaid with ebony, a gilded fireplace that belonged in a palazzo as the focal point of the wall”</li>
</ul>

<p>EDIT 7:</p>

<ul>
<li>[ <a href="http://www.marxdesign.com/TheMorganEstate/upper.html">http://www.marxdesign.com/TheMorganEstate/upper.html</a> ] (2013) “The upper silk fabric walls that blend with the original wainscoting painted by Dutch painter Van Amstel set the unique intimately warm tone of this office that includes a private powder room and a large wood burning fireplace.”</li>
<li>[79% of sample of The Driver from 2014] “Silk fabric walls blended with painted wainscoting. There was a private powder room and a large wood-burning fireplace.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, it may seem like it’s not plagiarism, but think about the elements of the sentence. The word order is the same: silk fabric walls, then wainscoting, then the powder room, then the fireplace. And the powder room is specifically private, and the fireplace is specifically large and fire-burning, and the walls specifically blend with the wainscoting. Though the sentences look different, the structure and verbiage is pretty much identical. It doesn’t even seem like Mark read this once and recalled it from memory. It seems like he wrote the first quote down word for word, then looked for a way to edit it so it might not show up on an automated plagiarism checker.</p>

<p>There’s also another similarity with I, Sniper and Tarantula. They both contain this phrase: “in a steady two-hand grip, trigger finger indexed above the trigger guard.” Both halves of that phrase seem somewhat commonplace, but the combined phrase is unique to those two.</p>

<p>Also a lot of people were saying “That’s just how snipers operate,” and I agree that technical jargon and actions are going to be described similarly in different works. There aren’t that many ways to say someone shot a gun or slammed a door shut. But the larger context is the similarity of both scenes overall:</p>

<p>In I, Sniper, (1 through 5 are in the span of three paragraphs):</p>

<ol>
<li>The protagonist Bob settles behind his rifle (feels the tension in the trigger, finds the stockweld, slides to the eyepiece, and sees the world through the the mil-dot-rich reticle)</li>
<li>He diddles with the focus ring until it declares the world pristine and hard-edged at five to eight hundred yards</li>
<li>He uses a Leica laser</li>
<li>He pulls out a Kestral 4000 weather station (and notes wind, humidity, and temperature)</li>
<li>He runs the data through his Palm Pilot, dials them into the scope of his rifle, then adjusts for windage</li>
<li>Then a few paragraphs later, he is alone in the world of scope, home in the feel of the rifle, the smell of the cleaning fluid, fiberglass on his cheek, his finger on the trigger</li>
</ol>

<p>In Tarantula, (1 through 5 are in the span of two paragraphs):</p>

<ol>
<li>A character called Tarantula settles behind his rifle (feels the tension in the trigger, finds the stockweld, slides to the eyepiece, stares into it and sees the trees and vegetation through the mil-dot-rich reticle)</li>
<li>He makes a minute adjustment to the focus ring until the last remnant of blur is gone</li>
<li>He uses his handheld laser</li>
<li>He takes out a small weather station (and notes wind, humidity, and temperature)</li>
<li>He notes the data in a small notebook and calculates the solutions and dials those calculations into his rifle, then adjusts for windage</li>
<li>Then a few paragraphs later, he shuts out everything except for the scope, concentrating on the feel of the rifle, the smell of the cleaning fluid, fiberglass on his cheek, and… an aluminum eyepiece against his eye socket? Definitely sounds like something a real gun buff would write...</li>
</ol>

<p>Also he seems to have taken information from a gun website basically verbatim:</p>

<ul>
<li>[ <a href="https://hermannsguns.com.au/dsr-1/">https://hermannsguns.com.au/dsr-1/</a> ] “The folding bipod is mounted onto upper rails (above the barrel), and the adjustable horizontal front grip is mounted on the lower rails (under the barrel). The rifle features fully adjustable buttstock and cheekpiece. […] The barrel is protected by ventilated aluminum handguard and is fitted with muzzle brake (very useful when firing full-power magnum loads).”</li>
<li>[Tarantula, 43% of sample] “The folding bipod was mounted onto upper rails above the barrel and the adjustable horizontal front grip was mounted on the lower rails, under the barrel. The rifle had an adjustable stock and cheekpiece. The barrel was protected by a ventilated aluminium hand guard and was fitted with a muzzle brake, useful when firing full-power magnum loads like this.”</li>
</ul>

<p>I mean, is this what we’re calling research these days? Just dumping an encyclopedia article into your novel with minimal editing?</p>

<p>EDIT 8:</p>

<p>Fixed the part where I said he had sold 6 million books. Someone in the comments said the 6 million figure is for downloads which includes freebies, so the actual sales figure may be a bit different. His latest John Milton book which isn't out yet says "Five Million Copies Sold" on the cover, though that might just be for the John Milton series specifically. His site says, "6 million books downloaded worldwide," not sold. Though his Twitter bio says "over 6m copies sold worldwide," so it could be that his website just hasn't been updated as recently. I'm just going to be safe and say "over 6 million downloads."</p>

<p>Also, somebody noticed that in his newer books, Mark is using a new tactic:</p>

<ul>
<li>[Never Let Me Down Again, 89% sample] "He opened Wikipedia and skimmed the details. It was a small resort on the coast with the locals relying on tourism to help them make their way. It was set on the edge of the Firth of Lorn, the bay reaching out in a horseshoe shape and shielded by the island of Kerrera and, beyond that, the larger Isle of Mull"</li>
<li>[Wikipedia article on Oban] "Oban occupies a setting in the Firth of Lorn. The bay forms a near perfect horseshoe, protected by the island of Kerrera; and beyond Kerrera, the Isle of Mull."</li>
</ul>

<p>All you have to do is have your character read Wikipedia in-universe so that you automatically cite your sources. Pretty good strategy, I must say. (This definitely isn't the most offensive of the evidence, I just found it funny that he just has his characters reading Wikipedia on their phones now.)</p>

<p>EDIT 9:</p>

<p>It looks like Mark Dawson has removed the Kindle version of Tarantula from Amazon, leaving only the Audible version up. He notably also did this with his novel The Black Mile, which some reviews on Amazon and Goodreads have accused of being extremely similar to LA Confidential.</p>

<p>I probably won't be updating this post too much, as I am pretty busy in my personal life, but I encourage people to share the information with newspapers and literary influencers and the like, and I'd also like to point out some common errors I see in articles being written on Substack and Medium:</p>

<ol>
<li>Mark Dawson did not write 20 books in 2 years. (I take full responsibility for this one. Despite correcting this claim in my post, the thumbnail for this post still says it on other platforms, forever reminding me of my mistake. Ugh). Also, generally I'd say don't mention prolificness at all. It makes other prolific authors feel like you're insulting their craft.</li>
<li>Mark Dawson does not run 20BooksTo50K. Michael Anderle started it, and Craig Martelle runs it. Mark Dawson has talked at their Vegas conference as a guest speaker, but that seems to be the extent of his involvement. Generally, don't mention 20BooksTo50K at all other than to say that he's a pretty well-connected, popular author who gets invited to guest speak at conferences. The group has a lot of fans who will defend it, and obviously saying he runs it when he doesn't isn't great for your case.</li>
<li>No conspiracy theories about ChatGPT. He wrote these books 10 years ago.</li>
<li>And obviously, no insulting self-publishing as a whole, or saying that any author who finds success is a sellout. For some reason, I see a lot of people doing this. When you write about a popular self-published author, you're going to attract people who are interested in the self-publishing space. Those people are not going to want to be told that most bestselling self-published books are worthless trash. That should be obvious.</li>
</ol>

<p>So if you'd like to help spread the story, please try not to repeat any of the misinformation listed above. It weakens our case and makes it easy for someone to dismiss an entire article based on a singular factual mistake.</p>

The ugly bastard of a command that combined </span><code>git grep</code><span> with </span><code>find</code><span> and 8 ugly incantations of AWK chained together – locked in there too.

If I wasn’t such a doofus it would contain even more than 26278 commands, because I’ve been keeping a long shell history for nearly a decade. But since I </span><em>am</em><span> such a doofus, I forgot to back it up (or deleted the backup too early) a few times and hence the </span><code>~/.zsh_history</code><span> on the machine I’m typing this only contains 1034 commands.</span></p><p>Someone might say: “well, if the command was that important, why don’t you save it to a script?” And to that I say: look, man, if I knew in advance which command would turn out to be important, then we wouldn’t be here, because I’d already have ascended to the astral realm.</p><p><span>Also: why </span><em>would</em><span> I record it in a script if I can just configure my shell to keep track of all of those commands for me?

It’s a drop-in enhancement of your shell’s history functionality and not only gives you everything I described above – incredibly long shell history and fuzzy-search through it – but also syncing and backup (yup, need that) of shell history across multiple machines, filtering commands by machine, working-directory-specific history and probably 13 other things I forgot. It’s </span><em>very</em><span> nice. Highly recommend it.</span></p><p>Whatever you use: make sure your shell history is recorded, make sure your shell history can grow ridiculously long, and get a fuzzy-search for it.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<h4>Jeff Thompson</h4>

<p>The collision of objects underlies most game experiences and user-interfaces. Baseball bats collide with balls, zombies bump into walls, and Mario lands on platforms and stomps turtles. Even something as simple as clicking a button (a rectangle) with your mouse (a point) is a collision.</p>

<p>This book explains the algorithms behind those collisions using basic shapes like circles, rectangles, and lines so you can implement them into your own projects.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE!</strong> This site has been getting lots of visits which is awesome. I've made some changes so it will look better on mobile devices, make navigation easier, and tried to look over everything for mistakes. If you have any problems or suggestions, please <a href="https://github.com/jeffThompson/CollisionDetection/issues">post an issue on the project repository</a>. Thanks!</p>

<p>Ready to get started? Skip ahead to the <a href="https://www.jeffreythompson.org/collision-detection/table_of_contents.php">Table of Contents...</a></p>
<!-- <a href="table_of_contents.php"><p class="nextPage">Skip ahead to the Table of Contents</p></a> -->

<h2>WHAT'S COVERED HERE?</h2>
<p>This book covers collisions between points, circles, rectangles, lines, polygons, and triangles. These examples are meant to be as readable and easily understood as possible. There are definitely faster, more efficient ways to detect these collisions, but this book is intended to be friendly and teach the principles with minimal math.</p>

<p>Each section include a description of the collision algorithm and an interactive example built using <code>processing.js</code>. You can <a href="https://github.com/jeffThompson/CollisionDetection">view the source code for all the examples (and this book!) on GitHub.</a></p>

<p><strong>NOTE!</strong> If you're on a mobile device, the examples might not work super well for you. They are designed for mouse input, so if you're getting frustrated or your finger is in the way, try the site on a computer.</p>

<h2>WHAT'S NOT?</h2>
<p>As with any book, there's a lot more useful material than could be covered here. Things that aren't discussed are mostly left out because the math gets too complicated. Three-dimensional space isn't touched on. Ellipses, which seem like they should be pretty easy, are actually very difficult.</p>

<p>If there's a specific collision not covered that would be helpful, please please <a href="https://github.com/jeffThompson/CollisionDetection/issues"> submit an issue with a request</a> or, better yet, submit a working example that you've built!</p>

<h2>ISSUES?</h2>
<p>If you find code that doesn't run correctly, an algorithm that isn't explained quite right, or a typo, please <a href="https://github.com/jeffThompson/CollisionDetection/issues">report them at this project's GitHub repository</a>. Thanks for your help!</p>

<p>If you’ve used an <code>*nix</code> system, at some point you’ve stumbled upon <a href="http://www.midnight-commander.org/">Midnight Commander</a>, a file manager based on the venerable Norton Commander. You’re probably familiar with the basic operations (<code>F5</code> for copying, <code>F6</code> for moving, <code>F8</code> for deleting, etc.) and how to switch panels (ummm, the <code>Tab</code> key). But <code>mc</code> offers so much more than that. This article aims to show all the useful (YMMV) shortcuts and functionalities that are often overlooked. Most of them can be accessed using the menu (<code>F9</code>), but who has the time to do that?</p>



<p>Before we get started, let’s establish some facts. This article was written and tested on the following software:</p>



<ul><li>Midnight Commander 4.8.13</li><li>GNU bash 4.2.53</li></ul>



<p>Oh, and make sure you’re running a modern and UTF-8 friendly terminal – for example, rxvt-unicode.</p>



<h2 id="hold-your-horses">Hold your horses</h2>



<p>There’s actually one thing I’d recommend doing before you run <code>mc</code>. <code>mc</code> has the ability to exit to its current directory. Meaning, you can navigate the filesystem using <code>mc</code> (sometimes it’s easier than <code>cd</code>ing into that one directory buried deep down <em>somewhere</em>) and when you quit <code>mc</code> (<code>F10</code>), your shell will automagically <code>cd</code> to that directory. This is done thanks to the <code>mc-wrapper</code> script that should be bundled with your installation of <code>mc</code>. The exact location is dependent on your distribution – in mine (Gentoo) it’s <code>/usr/libexec/mc/</code>, in Ubuntu supposedly it’s in <code>/usr/share/mc/bin/</code>. Once found, modify your <code>~/.bashrc</code>:</p>


<div><pre title="">alias mc='. /usr/libexec/mc/mc-wrapper.sh'

</pre></div>


<p>Restart your shell, launch <code>mc</code>, change to another directory, exit and your shell should be set to that new directory.</p>



<h2 id="selecting-files">Selecting files</h2>



<ul><li><code>Insert</code> (<code>Ctrl + t</code> alternatively) – select files (for example, for copying, moving or deleting).</li><li><code>+</code> – select files based on a pattern.</li><li><code>\</code> –<em>un</em>select files based on a pattern.</li><li><code>*</code> – reverse selection. If nothing was selected, all files will get selected.</li></ul>



<h2 id="accessing-the-shell">Accessing the shell</h2>



<ul><li>There’s a shell awaiting your command at the bottom of the screen – just start typing (when no other command dialog is open, of course).</li><li>Since <code>Tab</code> is bound to switching panels (or moving the focus in dialogs), you have to use <code>Esc Tab</code> to use autocompletion. Hit it twice to get all the possible completions (just like in a shell). This works in dialogs too.</li><li>If you want inspect the output of the command, do some input or just prefer a bigger console, no need to quit <code>mc</code>. Just hit <code>Ctrl + o</code> – the effect will be similar to putting <code>mc</code> in the background but with a nice perk. Your current working directory from <code>mc</code> will be passed on to the shell… and vice versa! Hit <code>Ctrl + o</code> again to return to <code>mc</code>.</li><li><code>Ctrl + Enter</code> or <code>Alt + Enter</code> – copy the currently selected file’s name to the shell.</li><li><code>Ctrl + Shift + Enter</code> – same as above, but the full path is copied.</li></ul>



<h2 id="internal-viewer-f3-and-editor-f4">Internal viewer (<code>F3</code>) and editor (<code>F4</code>)</h2>



<ul><li>The internal viewer has many built in modes for “previewing” the content of the file. Try “viewing” a binary, an archive, a DOC document or an image. In some cases, external programs are needed in order for this “previewing” to work.</li><li>If you want to preview the “raw” contents of the file, hit <code>Shift + F3</code>.</li><li>While the internal viewer and editor are powerful, sometimes you want to use your preferred software (<em>cough</em>vim<em>cough</em>). You can do so by setting the <code>PAGER</code> (for viewer) and <code>EDITOR</code> (for editor) variables (for example, in your <code>~/.bashrc</code> file). Then toggle the <code>Options -&gt; Configuration -&gt; Use interal edit/view</code> option (access the top menu by pressing <code>F9</code>).</li></ul>



<h2 id="panels">Panels</h2>



<ul><li><code>Alt + ,</code> – switch <code>mc</code>’s layout from left-right to top-bottom. Mind = blown. Useful for operating on files with long names.</li><li><code>Alt + t</code> – switch the panel’s listing mode in a loop: default, brief, long, user-defined. “long” is especially useful, because it maximises one panel so that it takes full width of the window and longer filenames fit on screen.</li><li><code>Alt + i</code> – synchronize the active panel with the other panel. That is, show the current directory in the other panel.</li><li><code>Ctrl + u</code> – swap panels.</li><li><code>Alt + o</code> – if the currently selected file is a directory, load that directory on the other panel and move the selection to the next file. If the currently selected file is not a directory, load the parent directory on the other panel and moves the selection to the next file. This is useful for quick checking the contents of a list of directories.</li><li><code>Ctrl + PgUp</code> (or just left arrow, if you’ve enabled <code>Lynx-like motion</code>, see later) – move to the parent directory.</li><li><code>Alt + Shift + h</code> – show the directory history. Might be easier to navigate than going back one entry at a time.</li><li><code>Alt + y</code> – move to the previous directory in history.</li><li><code>Alt + u</code> – move to the next directory in history.</li></ul>



<h2 id="searching-files">Searching files</h2>



<ul><li><code>Alt + ?</code> – shows the full Find dialog.</li><li><code>Alt + s</code> or <code>Ctrl + s</code> – quick search mode. Start typing and the selection will move to the first matching file. Press the shortcut again to jump to another match. Use wildcards (<code>*</code>, <code>?</code>) for easier matching.</li></ul>



<h2 id="common-actions">Common actions</h2>



<ul><li><code>Ctrl + Space</code> – calculate the size of the selected directories. Press this shortcut when the selection is on <code>..</code> to calculate the size of all the directories in the current directory.</li><li><code>Ctrl + x s</code> (that is press <code>Ctrl + x</code>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0MK7qz13bU">let it go</a> and then press <code>s</code>) – create a symbolic link (change <code>s</code> to <code>l</code> for a hardlink). I find it very useful and intuitive – the link will, of course, be created in the other panel. You can change it’s destination and name, like with any other file operation.</li><li><code>Ctrl + x c</code> – open the <code>chmod</code> dialog.</li><li><code>Ctrl + x o</code> – open the <code>chown</code> dialog.</li></ul>



<h2 id="virtual-file-system-vfs">Virtual File System (VFS)</h2>



<p><code>mc</code> has a concept known as Virtual File System. Try “entering” an archive (<code>*.tar.gz</code>, <code>*.rpm</code> or even <code>*.jar</code>) – you’ll be able to browse the contents of the archive like a normal folder, without unpacking it first. You extract selected files from the archive by just copying them to the other panel. Bonus points: try “entering” a… <code>*.patch</code> file.</p>



<p>This concept is even more powerful when you realize that remote locations can be viewed the same way. A quick way to browse an FTP location is to just <code>cd</code> to it: <code>cd ftp://mirrors.tera-byte.com/pub/gentoo</code> (first Gentoo FTP mirror I found). You’ll be able to interact with files as you normally do. To exit this remote location, <code>cd</code> to a local directory. Just typing <code>cd</code> will suffice as it will take you to your home directory.</p>



<p>VFS works for SFTP and Samba shares too. Check the manpages for more information on how to specify user/pass, etc.</p>



<h2 id="useful-options">Useful options</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Configuration</strong><ul><li><code>Verbose operation</code> and <code>Compute totals</code> – so that operations like copy/move have a more detailed progress dialogs.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Layout</strong><ul><li><code>Equal split</code> – uncheck to define your own ratio for panels. Maybe you prefer one panel bigger than the other? Useful especially if you keep one of the panels in tree mode (or maybe info/quick view, too).</li><li>Uncheck <code>Hintbar visible</code> – one more line available, one less line of noise.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Panel options</strong><ul><li><code>Show backup files</code> and <code>Show hidden files</code> – I keep both enabled, as I often work with configuration files, etc.</li><li><code>Lynx-like motion</code> – mentioned above, makes left arrow go to parent directory, while the right arrow enters the directory under selection. Faster than <code>Home</code>, <code>Enter</code>, <code>Home</code>, <code>Enter</code>, etc. This options is quite smart, that is if the shell command line is not empty, the arrows work as usual and allow moving the cursor in the command line.</li><li><code>File highlight</code> -&gt; <code>File types</code> is useful, as it uses a different color for example for executable files. <code>Permissions</code>, for me, is not that useful, but I can definitely see it’s use, for example, for sysadmins.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Appearance</strong><ul><li>Only one option here, <code>Skins</code>. You can check out different skins shipped with <code>mc</code> – just select one from the list. I prefer <code>gotar</code>, because it plays well with my <a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">solarized</a> terminal colors.</li><li>Useful tip – set up a different skin when logged in as the <code>root</code> user. It’ll be easier to differentiate between root’s and normal user’s session, when you’re swapping between them (as is often the case).</li></ul></li></ul>



<h2 id="bonus-assignments">Bonus assignments</h2>



<ul><li>Define your own listing mode (<code>Right/Left</code> -&gt; <code>Listing mode...</code> -&gt; <code>User defined</code>). Hit <code>F1</code> to see available columns and options.</li><li>Play around in tree mode: <code>Right/Left</code> -&gt; <code>Tree</code> or <code>Command</code> -&gt; <code>Directory tree</code>.</li><li>Compare directories (<code>Ctrl + x d</code>)</li><li>Fill up the directory hotlist (<code>Ctrl + \</code>)</li></ul>



<p>Well, that was a lot to take in. Of course, this list is not complete (that’s what <code>man mc</code> is there for), but I’ve selected the commands and functionalities that are the most useful to <em>me</em>. Embrace the ones you find useful, forget the rest and learn about the other ones I’ve missed!</p>



<p>Happy browsing!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Reaching the heights of almost $25 Billion dollars, anime is a market that has exploded in the past decade, outputting some of the most stunning stories, animations, and visuals the world has ever seen.</p><p>However, for so much success - for so much fanfare - the anime industry itself is shrouded in a fog; not because it's actually mysterious, but because people just don't particularly care enough to look through the glass.</p><p>This article expands on my <a href="https://youtu.be/BDEIPa9b3OU?ref=hitregbroke.com" rel="noreferrer">documentary piece</a> that explores how anime became an industry that pays its workers $5/day - apathetic workers that don't seem to care about the plight they're in, to a world that's ignorant, whether out of choice or not.</p><p>So - assuming you've watched the video already (or went and watched it, this article will still be here after you're done!) - let's <em>briefly</em> discuss some of the finer points that, for the sake of not overcomplicating an already 30 minute video with an 8 month production span, like </p><p>Questions like, well -</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Well - technically no, if any form of consequence is included A1 definitely did not get off scot free. The sheer amount of news headlines that the suicide made was not something to be scoffed at, even enough to make headlines in the <em>English </em>websphere - which is saying a lot.</p><p>Beyond that A1 did face legal repercussions, though probably not what you're expecting and/or hoping. The family of the deceased managed to get "workers compensation benefits" (whatever that means), and A1 was explicitly implicated in the case, but that's <em>about it</em>.</p><p>At the onset of this implication A1 said the following:</p><blockquote><em>If this decision is true, it is unexpected and we cannot comment because the reason for the judgment is unclear.</em></blockquote><p>which is up there with being one of the most corporate responses to a tragedy they <em>caused</em> as I've ever seen. In fact, I think it's made even worse when you discover this:</p><p>Japan is well known for being one of the harshest countries to work for - the saying goes if you're going to live in Japan, make sure you have a way to make money that's not actually working in the country.</p><p><em>Karoshi</em> (過労死) is officially translatable to "Death by Overwork," something that happened to our unfortunate animator at A1 alongside many others working in manga, anime, and etc. Hearing this, the first thought that probably comes to your head is that, well, <em>"The government should do something about this, right?"</em></p><p>Lucky for you, the government <em>did</em> do something about it. Though the obvious solution to solving the overwork problem (making it <em>illegal</em>) was not deployed; and admittedly would've been pretty much impossible to deploy anyways seeing how much the country seems to work. Instead the government set up a set of guidelines that outlined exactly <strong>what</strong> constituted excessive overwork, or as it's labeled - the "Death by Overwork line"</p><p>While I am not good enough at Japanese to decipher the finer details of <em>Japanese Law</em>, the line in principle is not actually there as an automatic weapon to implicate any companies caught red-handed for working their employees over this line, but more simply there to help establish a causal relationship between overwork and bodily symptoms of disease. Through the use of a satisfactory amount of overtime hours (typically 45-100+) in a certain period (typically 2-3 months) before the development of a disease (like cardiovascular or otherwise) an implication can be made - but nowhere I read actually said that the line can be used to implicate death or <em>suicide</em>. Though to be fair, I probably just missed it since I was reading summaries of the thing on <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%81%8E%E5%8A%B4%E6%AD%BB%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%B3?ref=hitregbroke.com" rel="noreferrer">wikipedia</a> and not the actual document itself.</p><p>Needless to say though, if death/suicide wasn't included in the original law, there would be enough loopholes that exist that the chain of logic of overwork -&gt; depression -&gt; suicide could be cut before the final act as the law doesn't explicitly state any connection there <em>could </em>be made.</p><p>This would probably explain why even though A1 (and later MADHOUSE) were in gross violation of this <em>Karoshi Line</em>, that none of them actually got any significant consequence from it beside just some headlines and some money they effectively had to throw at the victims' families to make them and the courts get off their back.</p><p>Getting back into <em>my lane</em> and out of the world of a foreign country's politics, this would probably explain the quote of an anime director Daiki Nishimura who said that </p><blockquote><em>"A-1 Pictures&nbsp;is not at fault... the current state of the entire business world that includes&nbsp;A-1 Pictures&nbsp;is at fault. To denounce&nbsp;A-1 Pictures&nbsp;alone is a mistake."</em></blockquote><p>Which, is true. The entire Japanese business world is at fault here for building a system that allows this kind of stuff. But I wonder what part of denouncing A1 pictures is a <em>mistake?</em> This feels like a complicated way of saying "oh but <em>he's doing it too!</em>"<em> </em>Change starts gradually after all.</p><p>And I know that I said I'd stay out of the lawyers hair, but one more twist of irony - the Japanese Labor Laws set in <strong>1947</strong> state that</p><blockquote><a href="https://elaws.e-gov.go.jp/document?lawid=322AC0000000049&amp;ref=hitregbroke.com" rel="noreferrer"><em>Working conditions shall meet the needs of workers to lead a worthy life.</em></a></blockquote><p>Working unpaid overtime (any amount, let alone 100s of hours) doesn't seem like conditions that meets the needs to lead a worthy life do they?</p><p>Anyhow, let's move on. Of course, none of this is legal advice, go consult an actual Japanese lawyer and not some random guy across the Pacific Ocean. And as I said before, this isn't my lane anyways, so let's move our focus from the Japanese parliament to a few (many) blocks down to:</p><p>In any conversation about the topic of working in anime, one of the main problems that comes up is that there simply isn't enough time to produce an anime a week constantly into perpetuity. And so a lot of people, understandably, decide that whoever came up with it must be the villain here. And trace your way back through a few links and you'll find that the godfather of animanga himself - Osamu Tezuka - was the one that came up with this whole upload schedule.</p><p>Though to be fair, Tezuka was no angel either - he was not very nice to work with in Toei (pretty much ignoring management and everyone else's input and concern in favor of his own opinions as a <em>manga artist</em> on how <em>animation</em> should be made), and even in his own studio he was known to slack off and make his employees pick up all his slack just for Tezuka to swing down and take credit for all of it.</p><p>But for all the bad rep the guy gets, is his pushing of anime production to one a week <em>really the catalyst</em> for everything wrong with the industry?</p><p>It didn't take a genius to realize that anime was a powerful export, regardless of whether or not Tezuka pushed the industry to its weekly upload schedule - in fact, this weekly upload schedule might have been the very thing that pushed anime to the heights it's at now. Imagine if suddenly the entire anime industry told us that in order to treat their workers more fairly, they were cutting down to uploading once or twice a month? How do you think the general public would react?</p><p>The issue that stonewalled what could've potentially been a thriving and prosperous industry for higher ups and workers alike may very well have been due to the situation Japan had caught itself in in the years prior and after Tezuka's propping up of Mushi Pro.</p><p>Beyond the fact that unions weren't particularly viable because of a general culture against it that still permeates today, Japanese workers tended to be used to working for very long hours because of an economic situation that the country found itself in the immediate aftermath of WWII</p><figure><img src="https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/2023/08/GDP_per_capita_of_Japan_1870_to_1950.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1021" height="646" srcset="https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/GDP_per_capita_of_Japan_1870_to_1950.jpg 600w, https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/GDP_per_capita_of_Japan_1870_to_1950.jpg 1000w, https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/2023/08/GDP_per_capita_of_Japan_1870_to_1950.jpg 1021w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>As you can see, Japanese GDP dropped by <strong>nearly half</strong> in the years of and following the WWII. This kind of ginormous economic downturn is, to put it simply, <em>not easy to deal with</em>, <em>for everyone</em> <em>involved</em>.</p><p>In this period of misfortune Japanese companies and Japanese workers seemingly formed an unsaid agreement with each other in terms of employment stability. The workers would work their asses off - and I mean <strong>work their asses off</strong> - in exchange for the company more or less guaranteeing the workers' job security. In this way the company didn't have to worry about losing its workforce, and the workers didn't have to worry about losing their <strong>job</strong>. Sounds like a pretty sweet deal.</p><p>This systematic trade off still somewhat permeates the country today. And with the entire culture revolving around the principle of working hard for your company like it's your family, it's unsurprising that the nascent anime industry also caught some of this principle in its workforce - though after a while, the company end of the bargain seemingly vanished while the workers still kept their half up.</p><p>Why? Well you already know why:</p><p>Outsourcing work isn't some kind of foreign concept to anyone who's thought of scaling anything before, and it's very likely that a lot of smaller scale domestic outsourcing was present in the anime industry before international mass outsourcing anyways.</p><p>And while I mentioned that <em>Mobile Suit Gundam</em> was one of the anime that was marked as a pioneer in this sense, you can be damn sure that a lot of studios were looking to outsource to decrease their labor costs - it just happened that Sunrise had either the capital or network to do so. So in a way, this development was as inevitable as tech companies outsourcing tech support to other countries. </p><p>Though, the dominant wave of hiring people as independent contractors instead of employees didn't actually show up anywhere in my research. Certain sources allege that political developments like the devolution of what was previous government responsibilities to private sector companies during the Junichiro Koizumi cabinet inspired this employment shift away from permanent employees to independent contractors.</p><figure><img src="https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/2023/08/Koizumi-Junichiro-2010.webp" alt="" loading="lazy" width="400" height="300"><figcaption><span>Junichiro Koizumi,. former PM of Japan</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, I'm skeptical.</p><p>For one, Junichio Koizumi was elected in <strong>2001</strong>, which was well after outsourcing first became popularized thanks to <em>Mobile Suit Gundam</em> and just a general realization by corporations that if they did that they wouldn't have to pay as much to employees. And as shitty as it sounds, well, if your only sole focus was increasing the bottom line then it's not an illogical plan.</p><p>And does what the government do really set <em>that much precedence</em> for private companies?</p><p>Anyways, the point is beyond me as well since I don't live in Japan, nor do I know anything of its politics (or particularly care to know to be honest). Even if it <em>was </em>true that Koizumi's cabinet influenced this shift, I am not the person to be confidently affirming this claim - leave that to the politicians and historians, or at least someone that lived their life in the country.</p><p>But wait - didn't I mention a political figure in the video? What was his name again...?</p><p>I mentioned in the ending credits that Taro Aso "formed" the Parliamentary League for Manga, Anime, and Games (colloquially and hereafter referred to as <em>MANGA</em>). And while everything said on that slide was true, including Hideaki Anno coming to speak at its inaugural conference, whether or not the former Prime Minister now Finance Minister of the ruling party did it out of any sort of love for <em>MANGA</em> is yet to be determined.</p><p>In fact, it's likely that this was (as expected, to be honest) a maneuver based more on politics and economic reasons alone. </p><p>Japan was already quite aware of the fact that the components of MANGA was amongst one of its strongest cultural soft power exports (and I mean, it's kind of obvious). So why wouldn't the <em>Finance Minister</em> want to prop up the industries that, let's be frank, made Japan famous in the public eye?</p><p>In fact, this movement of exporting cultural soft power, known as <em>Cool Japan,</em> was a movement that was induced by the government to literally do this exact thing all the way back in the 1980s, focused on disseminating Japan's image of "being cool" to the global markets through anime, manga, video games, JPOP, etc, etc, etc. And I think it goes without saying that it definitively worked. On you. On me. On everyone.</p><p>Whether or not this Parliamentary League actually <em>did</em> anything I don't know.</p><p>Cursory searches across the web suggest that they wanted to give tax breaks to people working in anime/manga/etc to help relieve some financial burden and also restart the bungled <a href="https://www.bunka.go.jp/english/about/index.html?ref=hitregbroke.com" rel="noreferrer">International Media Art General Center initiative</a> (I think that's the link?) that was shelved when the LDP (the party Taro Aso belongs to) was defeated. Whether or not any of this actually resulted in relief all the way on the <em>ground </em>is yet to be discovered. For now though, more and more stories keep coming out about overwork, underpay, etc. etc., so it's safe to say that the league's job is not done yet.</p><p>Though, is it even part of the league's job in the first place? Its mission is statement is simply to advance these arts in the national interest of Japan. You have to wonder if the national interest of Japan and the interest of the workers match up - hopefully they do, but there's been plenty of times where the government's goals and the plights of the people actually working don't line up completely.</p><p>Speaking of the people working on anime, what about the people that came up with the story in the first place?</p><p>This portion is going to be short, because at the end of the day manga artists, while the original creators of their stories, don't hold any power over how animators are treated. </p><p>And why would they? They're the creators of the <em>story</em>, not the people who contributed money to the actual production - they're very <em>different </em>things. If some mega rich manga artist successfully contributed his money to an anime's production directly, then he would be given the ownership share accordingly.</p><p>But manga artists don't have <em>time </em>for that. In fact, even with final power over how any creative portion of an anime should look, in the majority of cases it's the publishing company (in Jump's case, <em>Shueisha</em>) that makes decisions on behalf of the manga artist. Why? Well, manga artists have their own things to go tend to. </p><p>Like making manga. Of course, it's the manga artist's choice to dedicate his limited precious free time to going to tend to the anime - and in many cases they do - but it is <em>impossible</em> for them to pay it 100% of their attention all the time.</p><p>And if they <em>do</em> go in with final arbiting power, the people who actually funded the anime want to (if not have their own way) at least an honest discussion about it. But with so many companies funding the thing, just the discussion of it would drag out so long that it's not worth it.</p><p>Better the manga artist stay in his metaphorical lane, and the people producing the anime stay in theirs is the thought. The manga artist has no time, the companies funding the anime would rather not deal with bickering with the manga artist, and the general production system has nary a second to spare for these kinds of things since it's already so time-starved anyways.</p><p>And if the production system is so tight on time all the time - why in the world would anyone come up with the idea of having to double the workload just to get VAs their stuff earlier?</p><p>While I've done research into manga, anime, and how the two link, the third foggy branch of anime by the name of VAs is something I have done <em>no</em> research into. Absolutely none. I had a thought of making a trilogy on the topic, one concerning anime, one concerning manga, and one concerning VAs, all based on how fucked up it is to work in all three but that is a discussion for another time.</p><p>That being said, the doubling of workload to give VAs their portion first is more of a thing in the animators' ballcourt rather than the VAs. In fact, through my research it doesn't seem like the VAs had any influence at all over this seemingly superfluous doubling of workload - this was all just another thing the animating world did and another thing it shot itself in the foot with and the VAs said "Oh, uh... ok?"</p><p>The principle behind this though is, as always, benign. The "two shoot system" as it was called was started to actually draw in animators to work. Because more work means more pay - and everyone wants more pay right? Nevermind the fact that you could just pay your animators fairly, that'd make too much sense.</p><p>As you read this, you've probably thought that there was no <em>way</em> such an ineffective fix could've actually made it through without some other benefit - surely I'm leaving something out?</p><p>Nope. That was it. In exchange for paying animators more (by doubling their workload), episodes would cost 500K yen more to produce, and animators would have to do the workload twice.</p><p>...wtf?</p><p>And speaking of wtf -</p><p>JAniCA, retirement securing organization turned poster boy of anime unionization, was one of the closest ventures towards unionization the entire anime industry had seen in its history.</p><p>Sure there was the Toei union, but as I said in the video, what is a union meant for just Toei animation gonna do for the 99.9% of non-Toei animation folks out there?</p><p>There was also the <em>first</em> EISANRO union that consisted of a lot of movie companies  (assumedly including some animation companies) in the immediate aftermath of World War II, but they only managed to do a handful of things before being shutdown by... the US military? For being too... militant about their unionization efforts? I don't know why the occupying military would be concerned about some random Movie union getting too zealous when that was their idea in the first place but history acts in weird ways I suppose. The <em>second</em> EISANRO union was formed in 1965 and was mainly just for film and television, moving away from animation.</p><p>So with all that being said, how did JAniCA fail? It wasn't one particular company's fault, nor was it forcefully shutdown by a foreign military. In fact, at the time it seemed to the big buzz around as so many influential people seemingly finally came together to put an end to all this shit the anime was going through once and for all.</p><p>While I'm not particularly well versed in JAniCA's history, I can say that as much as JAniCA was an exciting prospect for many animators, for many others it was also the opposite. For reasons that are more tied to general Japanese culture than anything else, unionization has always been a taboo topic in the workplace, especially in anime. Many people don't even want to mention they gave the idea of unionization a thought because it's just not conforming to the social norm, in a country where conforming to social norm is an almost sacred principle.</p><p>However, the will for a union to <em>work</em> is just as important as people wanting to join it in the first place. And while the hype and hubbub about JAniCA was palpable at first (as always with any new happening), continuing that "hype" and actually sustaining it over the long term is an extremely difficult thing to do - especially if your founder <strong>leaves.</strong></p><p>While I never got any definitive answer to what caused Ashida to leave - whether it was infighting, age, or otherwise - I <strong>do</strong> know that he <em>did leave</em>. And regardless of whether or not the departure was adversarial or not, the fact that Ashida departed marked the beginning of the end for JAniCA, with the government it so relied on for support being voted out of power another fundamental happening that dampened JAniCA's future.</p><p>And for the existing members at the time, which, since it was originally a union meant to guarantee member retire benefits, included a lot of experienced (and assumedly influential) figures in anime, those two things were pretty much the last straw. With no leader providing a clear vision and no backing by the government, most of the older folks got jaded towards the situation becoming any better and promptly left.</p><p>Without government backing, without their founder (left and then deceased), figureheads (left and then deceased), and now without many influential members, JAniCA pretty much imploded. This is not to say that JAniCA doesn't still <em>exist</em> - it does, and if any unionization effort was to commence I'd probably give JAniCA to be the breeding ground for it - but that it's out of its prime and way out of the limelight.</p><p>Some sources also said that internally JAniCA was struggling with administrative and legal stuff as articles of incorporation were muddled, but is yet to be definitive.</p><p>Either way, the blaze to change anime burned out with JAniCA. Regardless of whether or not it was the union's fault that it failed, it reinforced the uselessness of unionizing and the hopelessness of the anime situation simultaneously. With so much money flowing to the top of the pyramid, it would have to take another cohort of influential animators to really revive the movement, which brings about the final, and probably most important question:</p><p>Tezuka is second to the Production Committee as the thing that ruined working in anime. And to be fair, it makes sense. They're the ones that are the controllers of the money - what would it hurt them to maybe take a million or two out of their ginormous buckets of profit to make it so animators can <em>eat?</em></p><p>I honestly don't see any real counter argument to that notion, and it seems like anime studios don't either and got markedly tired of it. Bocchi the Rock and Chainsaw Man were two examples of animes that were fully funded by anime studios, and achieved tremendous amounts of success. In this way the anime <em>studio</em> can confidently get all the credit and money from its own creation, and compensate its employees accordingly (hopefully accordingly)</p><p>Does that mean <em>every </em>anime funded by anime studios succeeds like that? No. Not at all. And falling prey to survivorship bias is dangerous when it comes to these cases.</p><p>However, the aforementioned "studio confidently getting all the credit and money for its own creation" is probably the most mind boggling thing for a lot of people (as well as me when I was researching the topic). How could people who worked on things like <em>Demon Slayer</em> not get tremendous amounts of money from such a giant success? </p><p>Well, besides the fact that the Production Committee owns the "stock" that is anime, the more important thing they own (that was not mentioned in the video) is actually the IP <strong>itself</strong></p><p>I'm not sure where this trend came from, and to be honest I'm not sure how it even became a concept. Through tradition, contractual obligation, or something else, most studios sell the rights to the things they create to the Production Committee. This sole action means that the studio does not receive royalties/commissions/<strong>anything else</strong> related to the success of the series. </p><p>This is also combined with the fact that anime studios are often the bottom of the command chain when it actually comes to making anime in its entirety. The Production Committee is the fundraiser and therefore the legal owner, but even TV stations and media conglomerates of the sort have more power than studios as the anime will <strong>never</strong> make the light of the day unless the stations allow it to be aired. </p><p>So with all that said (and much more <em>still</em> unsaid which I plan to cover in a livestream sometime), the ultimate question comes to bear:</p><p>To be completely honest, the video was supposed to originally be just about anime's <em>issues</em>, not about any solution - and that's pretty apparent in the relative size of the sections, with over 80% of the video just detailing anime's issues. But after looking it over and then looking at the YouTube landscape in general, I thought to myself, "Does this platform really need more pure negativity?"</p><p>The answer is no. </p><p>However, even beyond that, coming up with solutions to a problem that Miyazaki nor Satoshi Kon nor Isao Takahata nor any of the other countless numbers of actual influential people in the field could actually solve, is a bit of a tall order. </p><p>Though, this only refers to the <em>practical</em> specifics of a solution to the issue, not theoreticals. In fact, the there are only <strong>two </strong>theoretical paths that anyone could really go down in addressing the issue, the first option being:</p><p>The problem with anime comes down to the fact that people are working <em>too much</em> for <em>too little</em>. And while now we know that Tezuka was the one responsible for setting up this weekly upload norm, who's to say that we can't change it back?</p><p>Even reading that sentence likely made some of us feel uneasy, and that's for a good reason. The weekly and seasonal rotations of anime are almost synonymous with weekly uploads. </p><p><em>That's just how things are</em>.</p><p>And as mentioned before, the general public likely would not like the fact that their weekly anime is now reduced to biweekly, bimonthly, or worse.</p><p>But even beyond that, time is really the smaller of the two problems here. Investment bankers work 100+ hours a week and that's seen as completely fine. What's the difference?</p><p>Investment Bankers' sometimes $100+/hour and $150K+ a year salary is not even in the same league as animators' sometimes &lt;$1 an hour wages. Both are life-changing amounts of money no doubt, but one changes lives for the better, and the other makes people end their own.</p><p>However to be clear, the money problem is not that animators don't make anything, but that it's not <em>enough compensation. </em>In simpler terms, the <strong>pure</strong> fact that animators are making less than $1 a day would not be an issue if the daily cost of living (food, shelter, water, etc) was $0.01. However, the daily cost of living is much more than $0.01 (as you probably already know). </p><p>This is a fact that goes almost without saying - so much so that it's kind of like, well, <em>why am I bringing this up?</em></p><p>Because, the money path splits here accordingly into the two parts of the equation, one being increasing animators pay, the other reducing their expenses, so let's go over</p><p>The first path is to increase animators' pay - and to be brutally honest, this the only <em>real </em>solution of the two paths.</p><p>This is because all the problems in anime pretty much stem from the fact that no one is paid enough. Pay animators $150K+ USD a year and I don't think anyone would bat an eye.</p><p>The problem with this however, is multi-fold. And the first you can probably guess:</p><p>Companies don't like giving up money. Production Committees have operated under these current anime budgets for pretty the entirety of anime's history, and the chance is so low that you'd be able to convince any Production Committee to raise enough money to pay decent wages to every animator there is on a team that the probability of it might as well be negative.</p><p>And to be honest, there may just <em>too many animators</em> out there.</p><figure><img src="https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/2023/09/ORAFhaN.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="880" srcset="https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/ORAFhaN.png 600w, https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/09/ORAFhaN.png 1000w, https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/2023/09/ORAFhaN.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>The meme on animators pay that goes around (that is all too true)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What the hell does that mean? Well, it's not like all animators are equal in their positions. Just like the regular corporate world, more senior and skilled artists are put in higher positions that pay more ("more") while more junior and inexperienced artists are the ones that are dealt the whole $5/day bs that is usually the outrage that most people see. And it is coincidentally the fact that those on the bottom of the ladder are the ones that are usually the ones that are outsourced.</p><p>The actual anime production <em>process</em> wasn't actually covered in the video much as the specifics of it aren't particularly important in the grand scheme of the financial system that dictates what makes anime to be made; however, delving into the specifics of <em>paying animators more</em> <strong>does </strong>require at least a cursory knowledge of it, so let's take a brief detour (and I mean <em>really brief</em>)</p><p>To simplify the pipeline for our purposes, all we need to understand is the basic logic that drives the pipeline:</p><ol><li>What the anime looks like must be <strong>made</strong></li><li>The most important <strong>keyframes</strong> have to be drawn</li><li><strong>Every frame in between</strong> the above has to be drawn</li><li><em>Everything must look <u>consistent, correct, and satisfactory</u>.</em></li></ol><p>So let's start from the top, beginning with:</p><p>In every form of visual media, regardless of whether it's a movie, anime, cartoon, etc, etc, the most important part is someone actually <strong>deciding what it should look like</strong>.</p><p>"What it should look like" is much more than just what a character should look like or what colors we should use - in fact, in western media those are the jobs of the character designers, photography directors, color correctors, costume designers, scene compositors, etc, etc, etc. But even despite this, someone still has to <em>put together</em> the whole thing and dictate how all those environments, characters, dialogue, music, etc plays together.</p><p>This is what the director is typically responsible for, and it comes in the form of a <strong>storyboard</strong>:</p><figure><img src="https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/2023/09/storyboard-by-makoto-shinkai-vol-6-weathering-with-you-book-21.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="915" srcset="https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/storyboard-by-makoto-shinkai-vol-6-weathering-with-you-book-21.jpg 600w, https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/09/storyboard-by-makoto-shinkai-vol-6-weathering-with-you-book-21.jpg 1000w, https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/2023/09/storyboard-by-makoto-shinkai-vol-6-weathering-with-you-book-21.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Two pages from an almost 500+ page storyboard of </span><i><em>WeatherING With You</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>As you can see, there is a lot going on here - from compositional shots to where light and shadow should fall to camera movements, dialogue, music, and shot time down to the <em>frame</em>, <strong><em>all of this</em></strong> is the job of the director.</p><p>The literal creation of an anime is not an <em>easy job</em>, given to only the senior and most experienced. Accordingly, the directors are compensated fairly.</p><p>Well, not particularly <em>fairly</em> as compared to their western counterparts, but directors aren't usually the people that are struggling to make ends meet. This was the group that JAniCA was originally meant to serve: those people that had been in the industry long enough to the point that they were considering retiring.</p><p>And so while anime directors' pay are very much deficient as compared to the responsibilities they shoulder, the discussion here is not particularly aimed at them. </p><p> It's everybody else:</p><p>After the directors essentially create the anime, in come the people that have to actually execute on that vision - the people who actually have to <strong>draw</strong> the frames.</p><p>The director in the storyboard laid out the keyframes of the anime, but those keyframes are pretty much <strong>never</strong> detailed enough to actually use straight up in the anime. After all, the director doesn't have the time, he has <em>everything else</em> to worry about.</p><p>The storyboard is indeed just the <em>first draft</em>. The process of getting to the second draft involves the delegation of who will do what at what time (typically job of the administrative staff) and the people who have to go in and make the keyframes that were present in the storyboard actually <em>usable.</em></p><p>These "making-keyframes-usable-for-staff" people are referred to as <strong>t</strong>he <strong>LO</strong> and the <strong>Nigen</strong> people, who are responsible for turning storyboard keyframe into a less rough keyframe and then going from less rough keyframe to detailed specific instructions on how everything should look.</p><p>In practice it looks like this - the director's storyboard frames are taken from here:</p><figure><img src="https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/2023/09/ys-11-2.webp" alt="" loading="lazy" width="580" height="322"><figcaption><i><em>Your Name</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>To here:</p><figure><img src="https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/2023/09/Tokyo_Ghoul_Layout-1.webp" alt="" loading="lazy" width="754" height="424" srcset="https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/Tokyo_Ghoul_Layout-1.webp 600w, https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/2023/09/Tokyo_Ghoul_Layout-1.webp 754w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em>LO from Tokyo Ghoul</em></i></figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/2023/09/Genga_Example.webp" alt="" loading="lazy" width="755" height="530" srcset="https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/Genga_Example.webp 600w, https://hitregbroke.com/content/images/2023/09/Genga_Example.webp 755w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><i><em>(Ni)Genga from Iron Saga</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>Collectively, these two processes are known as <em>Genga</em> (原画). From here, the anime can actually be <em>made</em> - the directions from the nigen on where light, shadow, and color should go (the different colored circles and regions on the second picture) and the more general directions from the layout goes to the people responsible for making the anime <em>look like an anime</em>.</p><p>This invokes the job of the people generally at the bottom portions of the ladder - past the storyboard (絵えコンテ), layout (レイアウト）, genga (原画), and nigen (二原) and into the realm of the <em>douga </em>(動画）.</p><p>Douga people are the most junior people on the staff, and typically the ones that are outsourced. Sure genga, nigen, LO can all be outsourced, but those are typically key positions that <em>need</em> to have quality control or else the entire anime simply falls apart.</p><p>And as for the <em>director</em> - well, as mentioned in the end of the video <em>Satoshi Kon</em>'s movie <em>Dreaming Machine</em> is still incomplete, even though he made the storyboard for it and even part of the Genga. That should be a pretty good idea of how unacceptable outsourcing anime directors is.</p><p><em>Douga</em> though is different. After all, the douga-men are simply following instructions, whether from the LO and nigen "more-refined-drafts" or from the principles of animation that dictate how it should be drawn. This means that the douga-men are the ones that are outsourced en masse to the people who will do it for the lowest pay, and as a result are the ones who are dealt the $5/day treatment.</p><p>But aren't their jobs important too? If the director and genga-men have to get all their stuff perfect, wouldn't a botched execution just ruin it all? And if that's the case, why is this position so neglected?</p><p>Well, as you probably remember, there were not 3, but 4 points in the logic of animation production. Past all the drawings and creation of the anime, there is the extremely important facet of:</p><p>Anime production, as you may remember from the video, isn't a case of each person finishing their job and then just <em>leaving</em>. If that was the case then douga probably wouldn't be outsourced at all - with no one to QC the douga people they would have to necessarily be extremely good at it, and then be compensated better than what they're compensated at time of writing.</p><p>The only issue is that the system <em>isn't</em> like this. And honestly, it wouldn't be possible for a "go home when you're done" system to really work. The only person that knows how they want the anime director to go is the <em>anime director </em>themselves. Same with genga. Same with nigen.</p><p><em>Douga though?</em> Not so much. At the bottom of the chain and the most junior position, douga-men are never going to be expected to get everything perfect. In fact, everyone short of the executive producers and directors themselves is never going to be perfect. Of course, the executives are not perfect either by merit of being human, but their drawings is the <em>reference</em> that everyone else goes off of.</p><p>LO, Nigen, Genga, Douga, whatever terms you throw around that aren't the directors and executives, will have to be checked. The Genga by the director (of genga, LO, or the executive director himself), the douga by the genga, etc., etc.. The rule of thumb here is that if someone is below someone else on the ladder, that someone will be checked. </p><p>And while LO, nigen, and higher up people on the ladder may only be checked once or twice, douga people tend to be checked multiple times.</p><p>By the genga people. </p><p>Who now need to do their own work, check douga mistakes, and correct their own mistakes. </p><p>And because of the fact that douga is outsourced en masse with QC not even close to those of the more experienced people, this means that now the more experienced people need to check douga peoples' work (often very <em>obvious</em> and glaring mistakes) as well do their own work, and their <em>own </em>checked work.</p><p>This compounding chain of responsibility moves up the chain, meaning that now pretty much <em>everyone </em>needs to check <em>everyone else</em>, essentially brute forcing QC by way of repetition until perfection.</p><p>The whole issue of ill-trained douga-men has seen very gradual solutions, as anime studios post guides and documentation on how they want things to be done and how things <em>should </em>be done in terms of following simple animation principles.</p><p>But the issue still stands that there is not enough newbie training. And in the words of a friend who has experience in the pipeline but rather stay anonymous:</p><blockquote><em>All these people get a gig being a [douga] in an anime and they suddenly think they're hot shit, even though what they make is pretty much unusable. But they think they're hot shit, so they're terrible to work with, and their work is terrible, so...</em></blockquote><p>So.... wait, why did we go into this whole "how anime is made thing again?"</p><p>(I talked to this friend afterwards and he said that he was talking about the nigen people... which means that this problem is worse than we thought)</p><p>Japanese animators' pay, as compared to western counterparts, is hilariously deficient. It's almost not comparable.</p><p>However, the problem gets exponentially worse as you move down the chain of command until you reach the <em>douga</em>, which are the most egregious cases.</p><p>The only issue with fixing the most <em>egregious</em> cases is that there will always be someone that would be willing to do it for less. The bottom line is the thing that companies care about after all, and so even if a certain number of outsourced animators decide they want higher pay, companies will simply go to the people who are <em>willing </em>to work for that pay.</p><p>Typically, labor unions and collective action are the solution to this, but outsourcing ruins all of it because there is <em>no way</em> an international union of douga-men can function, making fixing the douga-men issue quite impossible.</p><p>Up the chain, as people get less and less outsource-able, the possibility for collective action grows - though as evident by JAniCA's failure, it's still <em>really really </em>hard.</p><p>So short of asking Production Committees and companies to "please give animators more money because it's the right thing to do" and shareholders and the stock market to "stop expecting infinite growth on a planet with finite resources," it is unbelievably difficult to reconcile the money situation at the bottom portions of the ladder. There was never <em>any </em>labor union directed at douga, and likely never will be until outsourcing is stopped completely.</p><p>So if increasing animators' pay is almost impossible, we must go to the second path:</p><p>While it's the temporary solution of the two, decreasing animators' expenses is by and aways easier to do than paying animators more money because of the current situation of... well, society.</p><p>And to this end I don't really have anything to say since you can come up with any number of ways to decrease expenses - however the most popular way it seems (historically) is to pay for animators' living expenses.</p><p>Whether it was <em>Anime Mirai</em> or another reincarnated version called <a href="https://gogetfunding.com/animator-dorm-2023/?ref=hitregbroke.com" rel="noreferrer"><em>The New Animators' Dormitory Project</em></a>, decreasing living expenses has proved the easiest since you just need to get enough money to pay for a house.</p><p>So if you want to, go ahead and donate to <a href="https://gogetfunding.com/animator-dorm-2023/?ref=hitregbroke.com" rel="noreferrer"><em>The New Animators' Dormitory Project</em></a><em>.</em> They didn't sponsor the video or this article or anything at all (I reached out to them for an interview but they never got back to me after I posted my questions...), but from what I see it's a genuinely good cause, managed by someone who used to be an animator himself.</p><p>Personally I want to eventually find an organization like that too, but based around the concept of direct dispersion of money to animators. But I'm some random college kid in the US who has never worked in anime. So.... yeah that'll probably take a while.</p><p>But if this is the solution (temporary as it may be), why didn't I mention it in the video?</p><p>Beyond the fact that I felt like plugging in a charitable foundation at the end of a video would feel like undisclosed sponsorship and just generally feel weird (even if I did explicitly mention they didn't sponsor the video), the power of the general public <em>knowing</em> about a problem is not to be trifled with.</p><p>Most problems in the world exist because there is not enough will to actually fix them. This goes for everything from climate change to animators being underpaid - whether lack of political will (due to whatever reason) or lack of will of the general public out of pure ignorance or otherwise, a problem needs to have a certain amount of people who <em>want it </em>to be fixed in order for the solution to actually come.</p><p>This is why the time path of the solutions crossroad is probably infeasible - it's not because it's impossible to do (it's as simple as flipping a switch really), but there would be <strong>no support</strong> from<em> </em>pretty much <em>anyone </em>to have anime go from weekly to biweekly or monthly or whatever.</p><p>Giving animators more money - well, there's not enough political will or will from companies to do so; but reducing animators expenses? Well there is a will, the will is just <em>too small</em> to really make a difference across the industry.</p><p>This is the principle reason why I <em>made</em> the video - not to go into the weeds and propose a detailed solution plan to a problem that people by the likes of Miyazaki, Takahata, and Kon were ill equipped to face (let alone <strong>me</strong>) - but to try to take action on the one facet of the solution that I really <em>can </em>make a difference in:</p><p>Letting people know about it.</p><p>Because at the end of the day, letting people <em>know</em> about something is half the battle to creating more public will to fix something. After all, most people don't even know that they don't know what's really happening behind the scenes. And out of the entire population of anime watchers there's a <em>very small </em>subset of them that know <strong><em>enough</em></strong> about the absolute state of anime to the point where they're motivated to act.</p><p>So at the end of the day, that video and this article serve just one purpose - exposing the issue. Only when the issue is exposed to enough people can any progress be made to reconcile this situation, because without pressure from the general public, no company or government or etc will have any incentive to change anything.</p><p>So go out there.</p><p>Tell people about the problem. About the <a href="https://youtu.be/BDEIPa9b3OU?ref=hitregbroke.com" rel="noreferrer">video</a>. About this <a href="https://hitregbroke.com/anime/" rel="noreferrer">article</a>. </p><p>And perhaps your word will spread to someone else, to someone else, to someone else, until enough people are in an uproar about the situation that the pressure forces things to change.</p><p>And <em>you'll</em> be a part of the solution as well.</p><p>(<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tnfn1GEOFNeUihWKRzCS8bfGbv9o5XlW/view?usp=sharing&amp;ref=hitregbroke.com" rel="noreferrer">Bibliography</a>)</p>

<p>What’s the difference between haha and jaja? What about kkkk or hhhh?</p>



<p>It’s a trick question: They mean the same thing. They’re all ways to express laughter, as interpreted by different cultures in different languages.</p>



<p>In person, laughter is universal. No matter what language you speak, almost anyone can understand the meaning of a mischievous giggle, sarcastic snort, or an infectious belly laugh. But it isn’t quite as simple when it comes to writing it down, especially in the era of social media and messaging apps.</p>



<p>Most English speakers are familiar with the nuances of when to say haha, lol, or lmao — each conveying a different weight to laughter. Other languages have their own specific terminology, some of which may not be immediately obvious even when translated.</p>



<p>Take Japanese, for instance. “Warau” is one way to express laughter. Some shortened that to just the first sound of the word, “w.” Others then noticed that “www” looked like blades of grass, leading people to start using the Japanese word for grass (草) to represent laughter. That continual evolution is why, if you want to write about laughing hard in Japanese, you could type 大草原: “giant grass field.”</p>



<p>Or there’s “askfhsjkd,” used in Turkish. No acronyms or wordplay here —&nbsp;keyboard spam is actually a popular way to indicate amusement among young Turkish speakers, as if they’ve been overcome by laughter and are unable to type complete words.</p>



<p>These are just a small fraction of the many ways people around the world represent laughter, from a little Nepali giggle — khit khit — to an explosion of laughter in Nigerian Pidgin: lwkmd, or “laugh wan kill me die.”&nbsp;We know the world can always use a little more laughter, so we’ve rounded up dozens of our favorite examples of how people from all over laugh online.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I BOW TO few in my admiration for the anthropologist, economist, radical leader, and delightful prose stylist David Graeber, who died unexpectedly in 2020 at the age of 59. Since I read his little book <em>Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology </em>in 2004, I’ve been telling anyone who seemed inclined to listen that he was the most important anarchist thinker since Peter Kropotkin, who died in 1921. His ideas, including those beautifully captured in his book <em>Debt: The First 5,000 Years</em> (2011), helped motivate and shape the Occupy movement, which took inspiration from his commitments to radical democracy, egalitarianism, and “prefigurative politics”—the idea that people seeking to make a revolution should try to live and organize now in a way they’d want to arrange their lives together in the future.</p><p>

Graeber studied at the University of Chicago under Marshall Sahlins and did his anthropological fieldwork in Madagascar in the early 1990s. When he returned, he published the still-neglected <em>Toward an Anthropological Theory of Value: The False Coin of Our Own Dreams</em> (2001), a work of high theory whose ambitions constituted a throwback to the eras of Marcel Mauss or Claude Lévi-Strauss, though its positions were strikingly fresh. On the strength of his early work, he got a job at Yale and at the same time became active in the “anti-globalization” movement (Graeber hated that term), with its demonstrations and actions against such organizations as the World Bank and the World Trade Organization. When he didn’t get tenure at Yale, he believed it was because of his politics.</p><p>

By <a href="https://publicanthropologist.cmi.no/2017/10/11/academic-politics-of-silencing/#david-graeber">his own account</a>&nbsp;politically unemployable in American academia, he claimed that, though the academy of that era sheltered myriad “authoritarian Marxists,” anarchism was considered beyond the pale, as I can confirm from personal experience. But with his remarkable energy and productivity, he landed on his feet in London, eventually scoring a richly deserved professorship at the London School of Economics. <em>Debt</em> continued his work at the juncture of anthropology and economics that had begun with <em>Theory of Value</em>. The two disciplines overlap, after all, in being concerned with the nature of exchange, the origin of money, and in describing structures of inequality, among other matters. The book had a remarkable reception; never before has an anarchist been enthusiastically blurbed by the editor of the classic capitalist organ <em>Financial Times</em>.</p><p>

Indeed, that book, and a lot of the best Graeber, has an “undeniable” quality: even if you write for <em>Bloomberg Businessweek</em>, it turns out, you are very unlikely to think the same things about money, debt, and value after you read it as before. You may well start to think you are seeing these matters clearly and nonideologically for the first time, as Graeber traverses the world’s cultures and history to see how forms of money and forms of peonage emerge. He shows that there have been many alternative possibilities for systems of exchange and value—Mauss’s “gift economies,” for example. All of this in loose yet precise and swashbuckling prose, and all of it well documented by a serious scholar. <em>Debt</em>, the book, had for many a dramatic “head-flipping” quality, and it helped make sense of what Occupy, emerging at that moment, was saying and what it wanted.</p><p>

The book yielded insights into many things but was compelling above all in giving a real history of economic hierarchy and domination, culminating in the structural and ideological predicaments of neoliberal capitalism, as each consumer blamed herself for undertaking the debt she carried throughout her life, and as the whole human world became, as though by an invisible hand, a completely unaccountable vertical power structure. People came to Occupy, for one thing, because they realized suddenly that the burden of debt they were lugging around was a structural strategy centuries in the making, not an individual failing.</p><p>¤</p><p>
The anarchism that Graeber developed across a series of protest actions and writings (including, eventually, 2007’s <em>Possibilities: Essays on Hierarchy, Rebellion, and Desire</em>, 2009’s<em> Direct Action: An Ethnography</em>, and 2013’s <em>The Democracy Project: A History, a Crisis, a Movement</em>, for example) was—is—notably contemporary and inspiring. Central aspects of Graeber’s politics as he framed them circa 2000–15 include “the rejection of the state and of all forms of structural violence, inequality, or domination”; “decentralized forms of consensus-based direct democracy,” as developed in Occupy encampments but also in many other places and cultures; “prefigurative politics of resistance” or the claim that a nonauthoritarian revolution cannot be conducted successfully by authoritarian forms of organization; “rejection of permanent, named leadership structures”; and anti-statist “communism,” economies based around sharing or even “the gift,” as suggested by the anthropology of Mauss, for example.</p><p>¤</p><p>
It has taken a little while and repeated readings for it to sink in, but I think that Graeber was reaching the point of rejecting, or at least severely (if implicitly) qualifying, almost all of these positions by late in his authorship. Particularly in <em>On Kings </em>(2017), his collaboration with his mentor Sahlins, and <em>The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity </em>(2021), co-written with the archeologist David Wengrow and completed just a couple of weeks before his death, Graeber’s politics grew more “mainstream” in a number of respects, even as his narrative of the origins of political authority and economic hierarchy remained fresh, radical, and richly documented, and even as his prose style retained all its charm. But perhaps LSE professorships, FSG book contracts, and the approval of the <em>Financial Times</em> have moderating or even co-opting effects after all.</p><p>

In <em>Dawn of Everything</em>, Graeber and Wengrow argue that neither inequality nor the state has any particular origin, indeed that “equality” and “the state” are not sensible or singular concepts at all. As issues in political philosophy, questions about the alleged origins of the state and of economic inequality arose in the Enlightenment of the 18th century, historians say, primarily because of the challenges presented by greater contact with diverse cultures in the era of colonialism. But these questions rested, Graeber and Wengrow argue, on a set of historically contingent, tendentious, and simplistic readings of human history by figures such as Rousseau and Turgot. Both “inequality” and “the state,” on Graeber’s late view (or on <em>late Graeber</em>’s view), are problematic and ideological concepts, not adequately defined, perhaps not definable. Hence, egalitarianism and anti-statism, insisting that these things ought to be destroyed, are equally simplistic and equally trapped in Western conceptualizations that emerged in modernity.</p><p>

It is not clear, to me at any rate, that one can be an anarchist and not also be an egalitarian and an anti-statist. Repudiating those two positions, by which Graeber definitely defined his politics circa 2010, amounts to repudiating the anarchist position, or else leaves you trying to define it in other terms, terms more adequate to the subtlety and complexity of power as it actually appears in real cultures. If he intended to generate such a reconstrual, he hadn’t quite done that work yet when his writing abruptly stopped.</p><p>

One wonders what Occupy-era Graeber, the man who (by <a href="https://davidgraeber.org/about-david-graeber/">his own account</a> and many others’) helped formulate the slogan “We Are the 99%,” might make of passages like the one below. Its placement near the beginning of <em>Dawn of Everything</em> indicates that it amounts to the book’s fundamental frame:</p><p>[I]t’s not clear what eliminating inequality would even mean. (Which kind of inequality? Wealth? Opportunity? Exactly how equal would people have to be in order for us to be able to say we’ve “eliminated inequality”?) The term ‘inequality’ is a way of framing social problems appropriate to an age of technocratic reformers, who assume from the outset that no real vision of social transformation is even on the table.</p>
<p>Debating inequality allows one to tinker with numbers, argue about Gini coefficients and thresholds of dysfunction, readjust tax regimes or social welfare mechanisms, even shock the public with figures showing just how bad things have become (“Can you imagine? The richest 1 percent of the world’s population own 44 percent of the world’s wealth!”)</p><p>
Here, he appears almost to be ridiculing himself and the Occupy movement (if also Thomas Piketty), or Graeber and Wengrow appear to be ridiculing earlier Graeber. Do I hear a touch of Friedrich Hayek? What was once a fundamental critique of the world economic hierarchy, insisting that it has created an absurd and ever-increasing degree of differential access to resources, has become “technocratic tinkering,” and it is not exactly clear why. That some questions about inequality are obscure or ill-framed does not indicate that inequality of wealth is not a fundamental social problem. To make sure you don’t miss the centrality of this stunning turnabout, Graeber and Wengrow return to their critique of egalitarianism in their conclusion, and also to their critique of the concept of the state. Of the concept, mind you, not the thing.</p><p>¤</p><p>
Late Graeber, in <em>On Kings</em> and <em>Dawn of Everything</em>, asserts again and again, in the words of the title of a long chapter, that “the state has no origin.”&nbsp;“Social scientists and political philosophers have been debating the ‘origins of the state’ for well over a century,” observe Graeber and Wengrow. “These debates are never resolved and are unlikely ever to be. […] Much like the search for the ‘origins of inequality,’ seeking the origins of the state is little more than chasing a phantasm.”</p><p>

This assertion builds on a complex analysis of social power emerging from anthropological and archeological research. Rejecting the classic Weberian definition of the state as a group of people who claim a monopoly on violence, Graeber and Wengrow argue that the modern state contingently combines three elements that are seen in history in very different configurations: control of violence, control of information, and individual charisma. Reducing political power ultimately only to the first of these paradigmatic forms of domination is, they repeat, terribly simplistic.</p><p>

“It seems to me that ‘the state’ is itself becoming something of a shopworn concept,” Graeber writes in <em>On Kings</em>. Debates about its origins, he continues,</p><p>almost always assume that “the state” is just one thing, and that in speaking of the origins of the state one is necessarily also speaking of the origins of urbanization, written literature, law, exploitation, bureaucracy, science, and almost anything else of enduring importance that happened between the dawn of agriculture and the Renaissance, aside, perhaps, from the rise of world religions.</p><p>
This is a mistake, he says, because “‘[t]he state’ would better be seen as an amalgam of heterogeneous elements often of entirely separate origins that happened to have come together in certain times and places, and now appear to be in the process of drifting apart.”</p><p>

But this “simplistic” conception of the state is also the conception that fuels or articulates the anarchist critique of the state, from William Godwin to Mikhail Bakunin to Emma Goldman. As I argue in my book <em>Against the State: An Introduction to Anarchist Political Theory</em> (2008), state power rests on violence and coercion; violence and coercion, to be defensible, require a moral justification; social contract theory and all other attempts in this regard are pathetically inadequate. Therefore, there should be no political state. In late Graeber, this looks simplistic and nonempirical. “The state” is a concept that falls apart under analysis and should be abandoned. Of course, that makes anti-statism just as senseless, for what is an anti-statist fighting against, really?</p><p>

“It is possible to have monarchs, aristocracies, slavery and extreme forms of patriarchal domination, even without a state,” write Graeber and Wengrow, somewhat puzzlingly, and “it’s equally possible to maintain complex irrigation systems, or develop science and abstract philosophy without a state.” So, “what do we actually learn about human history by establishing that one political entity is what we would like to describe as a ‘state’ and another isn’t? Are there not more interesting and important questions we could be asking?”</p><p>

Well, certainly there are other questions. But this one takes Graeber well beyond—or well before—his previous anarchism.</p><p>¤</p><p>
A fundamental line of argument in <em>Dawn of Everything</em> suggests, specifically, that Graeber was developing toward something like liberalism by the end of his authorship. This will of course please some and annoy others. I am in the latter camp, but I want to acknowledge that liberal political philosophy might find an interesting new set of justifications and also interesting new versions and formulations in late Graeber. In any case, Graeber and Wengrow centrally argue that concepts such as individual rights and democratic decision-making procedures, so central to Enlightenment political thought, in fact originated in an “indigenous critique” by colonized peoples of the political arrangements of European powers. They make this vivid with the figure of Kandiaronk (died 1701), a Wendat orator, probably from what is now Michigan, whose challenges to Western political systems may well have been (“may well have been” and “almost certainly” appear frequently in this book) influential on Diderot and Voltaire.</p><p>

This is a way of rehabilitating the concept of universal inherent individual rights and freedoms from the familiar claim that it is a Eurocentric artifact of colonial exploitation and the Marxist critique that individualist liberalism represents the official ideology of the bourgeoisie. Graeber and Wengrow suggest that such concepts in fact embody an attack on colonial exploitation and rising capitalism, made by the very people being exploited or destroyed.</p><p>

On this basis, the authors issue something like a universal declaration of human rights, rather different from the United Nations version, but related to it as well. They enumerate three basic liberties: namely, “the freedom to move, the freedom to disobey and the freedom to create or transform social relations.” They seem to hold that these rights belong to every individual in any culture. In a bewildering yet ultimately suggestive passage in their conclusion, Graeber and Wengrow write:</p><p>[O]ur own intellectual traditions oblige us to use what is, in effect, imperial language […] and the language already implies an explanation, even a justification, for much of what we are really trying to account for here. That is why, in the course of this book, we sometimes felt the need to develop our own, more neutral (dare we say scientific?) list of baseline human freedoms and forms of domination.</p><p>
I don’t think this is in keeping even with the vast panoply of political and economic arrangements that the authors themselves have just surveyed, but I agree that the book makes use of an “imperial” vocabulary, delineating the putatively objective, irresistible political truths that all rational persons will arrive at in the end. As to the idea that the freedoms and forms of domination that Graeber and Wengrow delineate are “scientific”: Rousseau and Turgot said the same, but I wouldn’t have thought that I’d hear the claim from Graeber, especially as there is no consideration in the book of other contenders for fundamental freedoms and no attempt to give foundational justifications for these specific freedoms, or even to sort them out in relation to one another.</p><p>

It’s not that I think we should routinely violate one another’s freedom to disobey, though that is going to require some elucidation. It’s that I’m somewhat surprised to see this sort of universalism emerging from this sort of anthropology, which supports it thinly at best and is widely and wildly in tension with it at worst. Graeber was never a relativist, exactly, but casually applying the same three concepts to every culture that has ever existed seems incompatible with his previous vast respect for human differences, not to mention many of his own earlier political positions. The persistent “threeness” of the distinctions hints at a line of a priori reasoning that is anything but empirical.</p><p>¤</p><p>
If I had to take a crack at characterizing late Graeber’s politics, I might say that he seemed to be becoming a mainline leftist or state socialist. In an excellent <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/11/david-graeber-dawn-of-everything.html">profile</a> of the author in <em>New York</em> magazine, Molly Fischer writes that, at the end of his life, Graeber was active in the UK Labour Party. “The reason I support [Jeremy] Corbyn, or am happy about him,” he said in an interview, “is because he is willing to work with social movements.” Graeber, reports Fischer, “had struck up a connection with John McDonnell, Corbyn’s shadow chancellor of the exchequer [in] an effort to bring ordinary Britons into the workings of government.” Corbyn’s communications director described Graeber as someone “sparking the imagination for what’s politically possible.” Responding to the charges of antisemitism that, in part, led to the end of Corbyn’s leadership, Graeber&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/DoubleDownNews/status/1433398863864401923">recorded a video</a>&nbsp;in his defense. I think that is pretty far from where he was in 2000.</p><p>

Perhaps Graeber’s political positions “matured”; most of ours do, really, if we persist long enough. Or perhaps the empirical data drew him in different directions, or his collaborators affected his expressions of his positions. Still, I wish we’d had a couple more books to see where this was going, and a couple of chances to hear Graeber’s own interpretation of his development in relation to his previous ideals. As it is, I’m left a bit disheartened.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>The National Security Archives recently published a&nbsp;<a href="https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb538-Cold-War-Nuclear-Target-List-Declassified-First-Ever/">declassified list</a> of U.S. nuclear targets&nbsp;from 1956, which spanned 1,100 locations across Eastern Europe, Russia, China, and North Korea. The map below shows all 1,100 nuclear targets from that list, and we’ve partnered with NukeMap to demonstrate how catastrophic a nuclear exchange between the United States and Russia could be. If you click detonate from any of the dots, you can see how large an area would be destroyed by the bomb of your choice, as well as how many people could be killed.</p>
<div>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>How to use the nukemap:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on one of the dots on the map;</li>
<li>Press detonate;</li>
<li>Select what yield (explosive power) you would like to use;</li>
<li>Press the red detonate button.</li>

<p><br>Even though today’s nuclear targets list is classified, it probably doesn’t look dramatically different. The United States still has about <a href="https://fas.org/issues/nuclear-weapons/status-world-nuclear-forces/">1,900 nuclear warheads deployed</a> on missiles and bombers (with thousands more on reserve), ready to be launched at a moment’s notice and able to hit their targets within 30 minutes. This unstable situation is extremely risky and has repeatedly come close to <a href="https://futureoflife.org/background/nuclear-close-calls-a-timeline/">triggering nuclear war by accident</a>. Moreover, many of today’s hydrogen&nbsp;bombs are&nbsp;hundreds of times more powerful&nbsp;than the two atom bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. If a nuclear war were to break out today, <a href="https://futureoflife.org/background/the-risk-of-nuclear-weapons/">nuclear winter</a> might&nbsp;kill most people on Earth.</p>
<p>This leads to an important question: Just how many nuclear weapons do we actually need? Seven&nbsp;of the nine&nbsp;nuclear&nbsp;nations&nbsp;have determined that deterrence requires fewer&nbsp;than 300 nuclear weapons, and none of them have been attacked. Yet, not only do the United States and Russia each have approximately 7,000 nuclear warheads — accounting for 90% of the world’s arsenal – both countries are currently escalating the situation, making&nbsp;massive investments to enhance their&nbsp;arsenals with more accurate and lethal&nbsp;nuclear weapons. Many military analysts agree that the U.S. and Russia could easily meet their&nbsp;deterrence needs with much fewer nuclear weapons. Even the Pentagon has stated that the U.S. needs no more than 1,000 nukes to deter a nuclear attack. But don’t take their word for it:&nbsp;play with the map yourself and see just how destructive nuclear weapons can be!</p>
<h2>1100 Nuclear Targets, Radioactive Fallout, and Weather</h2>
<p>While the maps above show a general radius of nuclear destruction, weather patterns would play a role in how many people would be affected by nuclear fallout. Given that weather can change day to day, if we drop a nuclear bomb near a border in one country on the wrong day, innocent people in a neighboring country could also suffer the effects of radioactive fallout. How far and in which direction the radioactive materials travel would depend on the size of the bomb and the local weather. In the following graphics, Alex Wellerstein simulates two terrifying possibilities (<em>We recommend viewing the following slideshows in the full-screen option to more easily see where the radioactive material will travel.</em>):</p>
<h3>1) What would have happened if all 1,100 nuclear targets were struck by a nuclear weapon of a given size on April 29, 2016?</h3>
<p>In this slideshow, the bombs grow larger, and the nuclear fallout spreads farther from the target in a direction that’s dictated by the local weather patterns. Note that this slideshow doesn’t yet show the effect of nuclear winter: if enough smoke from nuclear fires rises high into the stratosphere, it can spread across our planet and trigger a decade-long mini-ice-age and farming collapse, potentially killing most of Earth’s 7 billion people.<br></p>
<h3>2) How would the direction of radioactive fallout change if the bombs were dropped on three different days?</h3>
<p>In this case, we use weather data from April 29, April 30 and May 1 of 2016 to see how the direction of nuclear fallout changes if 100 kt bombs were dropped on the 1,100 nuclear targets (typical bombs today are many times more powerful). Different weather patterns would send nuclear fallout in different directions on each day. Pay close attention to countries like Germany, Denmark and Finland, which could get hit with radioactive fallout if the nuclear targets were struck on the wrong day.<br></p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>A few months ago, I got given a laptop with a very interesting condition.
The BIOS setup menu was supposedly inaccessible, and nothing apart from the default
boot option works. Time to investigate to see what is actually happening
and what we can do about it.</p>

<h2 id="the-status-quo">The status quo</h2>

<p>When starting the laptop without doing anything special, the default option
boots just fine, as expected. However, while pressing F2 during boot causes
a beep tone, it ends up falling through to the same behavior as if nothing
was pressed. On the other hand, pressing F12 lands us in a very empty
boot menu:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.timschumi.net/images/ah532-bios-investigation/boot-menu-broken.png" alt="The broken boot menu">
<img src="https://blog.timschumi.net/images/ah532-bios-investigation/application-menu-broken.png" alt="The broken application menu"></p>

<p>This, obviously, is not good. The boot menu should (at least) show all bootable
UEFI devices in addition to the boot entries that have been created manually.</p>



<p>Of course, the first thing that one would try is to reset the BIOS settings.
Since the CMOS battery is quite hidden behind plastic shielding, I instead
bridged the <code>CL1_CL2</code> test point that is located under the RAM slot.</p>

<p>After the BIOS reinitialized, the boot menu looks like the following:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.timschumi.net/images/ah532-bios-investigation/boot-menu-partial.png" alt="The partially fixed boot menu">
<img src="https://blog.timschumi.net/images/ah532-bios-investigation/application-menu-partial.png" alt="The partially fixed application menu"></p>

<p>The manually created boot option is now gone, and device-based boot options
show up instead. However, trying to enter the BIOS setup menu still shows the same
fallthrough behavior as it did before.</p>

<p>Luckily, there now is the option to boot from USB storage, so the BIOS
flash utilities <a href="https://support.ts.fujitsu.com/">provided by Fujitsu</a>
are a possibility going forward. Note that (at least for the AH532)
there are multiple hardware revisions, so I had to go through the
device serial number to arrive at the correct set of downloads.</p>

<p>After flashing the BIOS and rebooting, the boot menu looks normal
and pressing F2 to enter the BIOS setup menu works like a charm:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.timschumi.net/images/ah532-bios-investigation/boot-menu-complete.png" alt="The complete boot menu">
<img src="https://blog.timschumi.net/images/ah532-bios-investigation/application-menu-complete.png" alt="The complete application menu"></p>

<h2 id="isolating-a-reproducer">Isolating a reproducer</h2>

<p>Now that I was back in a working setup, the first thing I did was to make
a backup of the current configuration. For that, I made an image of the
Winbond 25Q32BVSIG SPI flash chip that is marked as “U35” on the motherboard,
as it contains the whole UEFI PI firmware volume including executable code
and data storage. Whenever something is broken, I can now just flash back
the image instead of going through a full reset-CMOS-and-update-firmware cycle.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.timschumi.net/images/ah532-bios-investigation/u35-location.png" alt="Location of the U35 chip on the motherboard"></p>

<p>For easier testing, I also wanted a better reproducer than “reinstall your distribution of choice”.
Therefore, I tried the first thing that came to mind, and it immediately broke the boot menu again:</p>

<div><pre><code># efibootmgr -c
BootOrder: 0000
Boot0000* Linux
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Warning</strong>: Do <em>NOT</em> run this command twice. Doing so made the boot menu completely inaccessible.</p>

<h2 id="excursion-uefi-boot-entry-handling">Excursion: UEFI boot entry handling</h2>

<p>At a high level, UEFI stores data in a large key-value store that is collectively called
“UEFI variables”. Included in those variables are (among other things) boot entries and
related settings. Variable access is done through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181025075625/wiki.phoenix.com/wiki/index.php/EFI_RUNTIME_SERVICES#GetNextVariableName.28.29">standardized interfaces</a>
that are documented in <a href="https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI_Spec_2_10_Aug29.pdf">the UEFI specification</a>.</p>

<p>Boot entries are stored in entries named <code>BootXXXX</code>, where <code>XXXX</code> is a four digit hexadecimal
number. Boot option order is determined through the <code>BootOrder</code> entry, which lists all
four digit hexadecimal numbers in the order that they should appear in.</p>

<p>On my Framework laptop, the boot entries are set up as follows:</p>

<div><pre><code>BootOrder: 0002, 0001, 2001, 2002, 2003
Boot0001: "Windows Boot Manager"
Boot0002: "GRUB"
Boot2001: "EFI USB Device"
Boot2002: "EFI DVD/CDROM"
Boot2003: "EFI Network"
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="putting-the-pieces-together">Putting the pieces together</h2>

<p>Suddenly, the <code>efibootmgr -c</code> output above doesn’t look all that confidence-inspiring.
The command is supposed to create a new entry and insert it at the top of the
boot entry list, but it ended up clearing the entire list instead. Running <code>efibootmgr</code>
on a fresh boot also doesn’t result in quite the expected output:</p>

<div><pre><code># efibootmgr -v
Could not read variable 'BootNext': No such file or directory
Could not read variable 'BootCurrent': No such file or directory
Could not read variable 'BootTimeout': No such file or directory
Could not read variable 'BootOrder': No such file or directory
No BootOrder is set; firmware will attempt recovery
Could not read variable 'MirrorCurrent': No such file or directory
Could not read variable 'MirrorRequest': No such file or directory
</code></pre></div>

<p>It appears that Linux is unable to read existing variables from storage, which is
immediately confirmed by inspecting the source of truth:</p>

<div><pre><code># ls -al /sys/firmware/efi/efivars/
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 0 Jan 15 16:09 .
drwxr-xr-x 5 root root 0 Jan 15 16:09 ..
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: At this point, I checked that Windows and various other UEFI tools are
able to read the variables just fine, so Linux’ output is confirmed to be incorrect.</p>

<p>Now, this explains why the custom boot entries and the device-based boot entries
end up being gone. <code>efibootmgr</code> can’t find any existing boot entry setup and just
assumes that it can create a new setup without repercussions.</p>

<p>But why does it make the BIOS setup unusable? Using <a href="https://github.com/LongSoft/UEFITool">UEFITool</a>,
I inspected the flash image I made earlier, and reconstructed the following entries:</p>

<div><pre><code>BootOrder: 000E, 000D, 0006, 0007, 0008, 0009, 000A, 000B
Boot0000: "BIOS Setup"
Boot0001: "Boot Menu"
Boot0002: "Diagnostic Screen"
Boot0003: "Recovery and Utility"
Boot0004: "Diagnostic Program"
Boot0005: "Diagnostic Progrogram ROM"
Boot0006: "Floppy Disk Drive"
Boot0007: "Drive0 HDD"
Boot0008: "CD/DVD Drive"
Boot0009: "NETWORK"
Boot000A: "USB HDD"
Boot000B: "USB CD/DVD"
Boot000C: "Erase Disk"
Boot000D: "Windows Boot Manager"
Boot000E: "proxmox"
</code></pre></div>

<p><em>Oh, no…</em></p>

<p>“BIOS Setup” is an actual boot menu entry.</p>

<p>And it gets overwritten by the new boot entry that gets placed erroneously.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Attentive readers might have noticed the reason for why everything breaks
completely when running <code>efibootmgr -c</code> twice: The second boot entry that
is created would be <code>Boot0001</code>, which successfully replaces “Boot Menu”.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-temporary-band-aid">Creating a temporary band-aid</h2>

<p>Now that I knew what went wrong, I was able to create a small program that resets
the boot order, as well as the BIOS setup and boot menu entries to their expected
contents.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This program is based on an UEFI dump of a Fujitsu LIFEBOOK AH532 (YLKV).
It is unlikely that it will work on any other hardware (revision) that happens to have
the same symptoms. Furthermore, the written data may also be dependent on the firmware
revision, so take caution when running this on a firmware version that is not v1.08 or
v1.09.</p>

<p><strong>Warning</strong>: I assume no liability for broken hardware or software due to correct or incorrect
usage of this tool.</p>

<p>Naturally, this isn’t a great solution, since users will continue to brick their installations initially, just like they
did <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/efibootmgr/+bug/1082418">for the last 10 years</a>. However, this is everything
that I managed to research so far, and the band-aid fix makes it reasonable for publication.</p>

<p>I will look into fixing this properly at some point in the future, and if I manage to do so this post will probably get a part
two, so stay tuned. (Apparently Jekyll supports RSS?)</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2024/01/20/1800">https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2024/01/20/1800</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39070730">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="main" data-clarity-region="article">
<p>The <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/links/2023/09/28/0810" rel="next">launch of the Raspberry Pi 5</a> was a bit… underwhelming, to be honest.</p>
<p>Part of that is because the Raspberry Pi Foundation favors incremental improvement and a conservative approach to hardware design, which is understandable given their target markets.</p>
<p>But there is a wider scope of use cases for <code>ARM</code> boards these days, and I’m not sure the Raspberry Pi 5 is the best “next step” beyond the 4 for what I aim to do, so I decided to take a look at the <a href="http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-5-plus.html" rel="external">Orange Pi 5+</a> instead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Orange Pi sent me a review unit (for which I thank them), and this article follows my <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/site/review_policy" rel="next">Review Policy</a>. Also, I purposely avoid doing any price comparisons with the Pi 5 (or the Pi 5 plus an equivalent set of add-ons) because I think the Orange Pi 5+ is a different beast altogether.</p>

<a id="anchor-hardware-specs" href="https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2024/01/20/1800#hardware-specs" rel="anchor"><h2 id="hardware-specs">Hardware Specs</h2></a><p>The <a href="http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-5-plus.html" rel="external">Orange Pi 5+</a> is pretty much a textbook Rockchip design, with a few interesting tidbits:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <code>RK3588</code> chipset (with 4xA76/2.4GHz cores and 4xA55/1.8GHz cores, plus a Mali-G610 MP4 <code>GPU</code> and an <code>NPU</code>)</li>
<li>An M.2 2280 PCIe 3.0x4 <code>NVMe</code> slot (leveraging the <code>PCIe 3.0</code> lanes the <code>3588</code> provides)</li>
<li>An M.2 E Key 2230 slot (for WiFi/BT)</li>
<li>Dual <code>HDMI</code> outputs (rated for 8k60)</li>
<li>One <code>HDMI</code> input (rated for 4k60)</li>
<li>DisplayPort 1.4 (8K30) via USB C</li>
<li>Dual 2.5GbE ports</li>
</ul>
<p>…plus numerous USB ports, a typical set of single-board computer connections (<code>SPI</code>, <code>MIPI</code> and a 40-pin <code>GPIO</code> header), a microphone and an IR receiver:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://taoofmac.com/media/blog/2024/01/20/1800/ZaCCSFzAKFtMYj8QaLcc4gFxeVw=/board.jpg" title="the bare board" width="2048" height="831">
<figcaption>Both sides of the board. It's roughly twice the footprint of a Pi, but has full-size connectors for everything.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This makes for a very interesting board with lots of standardized I/O, and I was very curious to see how it would fare as both a thin client and (more importantly) as a server.</p>
<p>Sadly, the board I got only has 4GB of RAM, which made it impossible to test some of the things I had planned (the upper SKU right now ships with 16GB of RAM, and there is going to be a 32GB version as well).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I went ahead and added the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.amazon.es/gp/product/B09QV692XY/ref=as_li_tl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=taoofmac-21&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=3638&amp;creative=24630" rel="external">1TB WD Black SN770 <code>NVMe</code> drive</a> (PCIe Gen 4, a bit overkill but useful for testing since it removes any I/O bottlenecks)</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.amazon.es/gp/product/B0B5LV5K1H/ref=as_li_tl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=taoofmac-21&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=3638&amp;creative=24630" rel="external">Realtek RTL8852BE WiFi 6/Bluetooth 5.2 card</a> (which I had lying around)</li>
</ul>
<p>This made for a pretty beefy setup nonetheless, and I was able to test quite a few things since I got it early this month.</p>
<a id="anchor-cooling-case-and-power" href="https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2024/01/20/1800#cooling-case-and-power" rel="anchor"><h2 id="cooling-case-and-power">Cooling, Case and Power</h2></a><p>The sample unit came without a cooling solution, but even though there is an official heatsink (with a fan that uses the 2-pin <code>PCB</code> connector), given my dislike for fan noise I opted for hacking some purely passive cooling.</p>
<p>So I took some spare copper blocks I had gotten for other projects and used leftover thermal strips to attach them to the <code>RK3588</code>, the <code>DRAM</code> chips and a couple of other chips. This worked wonderfully and kept the CPU at a cool 39<sup>o</sup>C when idle.</p>
<p>While I waited for the <code>NVMe</code> drive to arrive, I decided to <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/notes/2024/01/07/1800" rel="next">find and print a suitable case</a> for it:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://taoofmac.com/media/blog/2024/01/20/1800/ZLmRL_czgujKnJo29bZTj23IEew=/case_top.jpg" title="Hexagons are the bestagons" width="2048" height="1275">
<figcaption>This was designed to be stood up, and is a nice modular design.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>With this case closed and stood up vertically, the CPU temperature on idle slowly rose to 45<sup>o</sup>C, which is still pretty good for a passive setup.</p>
<p>After I added the <code>NVMe</code> drive (with its own heatsink) and started testing things, temperatures rose a couple of degrees, but the passive setup still worked fine<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2024/01/20/1800#fn:1" rel="anchor">1</a></sup>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://taoofmac.com/media/blog/2024/01/20/1800/DeH_o2JxuPs263Cn3eqzS1TpcLE=/case_bottom.jpg" title="adding an NVMe" width="2048" height="1441">
<figcaption>Another reason I picked this case is the easy access to components.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Power-wise, the board idles just under 5W, and I managed to get it up to 15W (measured from the wall socket) while running <a href="https://github.com/vitoplantamura/OnnxStream" rel="external">OnnxStream</a> at full tilt (more on that below, but suffice it to say that this was with all cores running inference and a lot of SSD throughput).</p>
<p>This is roughly half the power envelope of a comparable mini-PC, although I wouldn’t place much stock on the raw values without considering the overall performance of the system <em>and</em> what it is being used for.</p>
<p>But it is nice to see how efficient the board is given the amount of horsepower it has.</p>
<a id="anchor-operating-system-support" href="https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2024/01/20/1800#operating-system-support" rel="anchor"><h2 id="operating-system-support">Operating System Support</h2></a><p>Software support is always the Achilles heel of Raspberry Pi alternatives, but Orange Pi <a href="http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/service-and-support/Orange-Pi-5-plus.html" rel="external">has various OS images available for the 5 Plus</a>. This includes their own flavors of Arch and Android, but also reasonably stock <a href="http://openwrt.org/" rel="external">OpenWRT</a>, Ubuntu and Debian images (which have <a href="https://github.com/orangepi-xunlong/orangepi-build" rel="external">build scripts available on GitHub</a>).</p>
<p>I tried a couple of those while my <code>NVMe</code> was in transit, but since I was planning on using the board as a server I decided to go with <a href="http://armbian.com/" rel="external">Armbian</a> in later tests, which is a well supported distribution that has been around for a long time and has an active community (plus a reasonable assurance of long-term updates).</p>
<p><a href="http://armbian.com/" rel="external">Armbian</a> currently provides a Debian 12 <code>bookworm</code> image as a release candidate for the Plus 5–however, since the <code>RK3588</code> support is still not fully baked for kernel 6.x, I had to install a version with kernel 5.1.</p>
<p>Not that I didn’t make an effort–the 6.7 <code>edge</code> version wouldn’t even boot, and trying to upgrade to the default 6.1 kernel also failed, forcing me to mount the SD card on another machine and restore the 5.1 kernel.</p>
<p>And, in general, right now Rockchip images are mostly kernel 5.x based, but <a href="https://gitlab.collabora.com/hardware-enablement/rockchip-3588/notes-for-rockchip-3588/-/blob/main/mainline-status.md" rel="external">given what teams like Collabora are doing</a> I expect this to improve over time.</p>
<a id="anchor-use-cases" href="https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2024/01/20/1800#use-cases" rel="anchor"><h2 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h2></a><p>But before I settled on <a href="http://armbian.com/" rel="external">Armbian</a>, I had time to test the board in a couple different scenarios:</p>
<a id="anchor-tiny-mighty-router" href="https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2024/01/20/1800#tiny-mighty-router" rel="anchor"><h3 id="tiny-mighty-router">Tiny, Mighty Router</h3></a><p>This was the first (and easiest) thing to test off an SD card, and it didn’t disappoint.</p>
<p>The stock <a href="http://openwrt.org/" rel="external">OpenWRT</a> image booted up fine, but since I only have gigabit fiber and gigabit LAN (and the only machine with 2.5GbE is in my server closet) I wasn’t really able to push the hardware to its limits in my office.</p>
<p>But again, I made an attempt and was able to get transfer rates of a little over 122MB/s (roughly 970Mbit/s) through it. The <code>RK3588</code> is somewhat overkill for a router, so no surprises here. I’m positive it would fare just as well with 2.5GbE traffic, and I will likely have an opportunity to test that in the future, since I plan on swapping one of my managed switches for a PoE-enabled one with 2.5GbE ports.</p>
<a id="anchor-desktop-use" href="https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2024/01/20/1800#desktop-use" rel="anchor"><h3 id="desktop-use">Desktop Use</h3></a><p>There’s not much to say here either–I wrote the Orange Pi Debian 12 <code>XFCE</code> image to an SD card and used it as a thin client for a few days, and it worked great–for starters, it was able to cope with <em>both</em> my monitors at decent resolutions.</p>
<p>I only tested via <code>HDMI</code>, but was able to get a usable desktop across both the <a href="https://www.amazon.es/gp/product/B07VB339T5/ref=as_li_tl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=taoofmac-21&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=3638&amp;creative=24630" rel="external">LG Dual Up</a> and my <a href="https://www.amazon.es/gp/product/B0798TGN2M/ref=as_li_tl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=taoofmac-21&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=3638&amp;creative=24630" rel="external">LG 34WK95U-W</a>, although of course Linux still has issues with widely different display resolutions, etc. Nothing untoward here, and <code>XFCE</code> was snappy enough.</p>
<p>As a Remote Desktop Client (using <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2024/01/20/apps/remmina" rel="nofollow">Remmina</a>), the <a href="http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-5-plus.html" rel="external">Orange Pi 5+</a> beat the <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/hw/raspberry_pi" rel="next">Raspberry Pi 4</a> figures <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2022/10/23/1700" rel="next">I got last year</a>, but not by much–and the reason for that is simply because it is all very server-dependent, and I was using the same server for both tests.</p>
<p>But I did get a solid 60fps on <a href="https://www.testufo.com/" rel="external">the UFO test</a> rendered on a remote desktop, and <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2024/01/20/apps/remmina" rel="nofollow">Remmina</a> was about as snappy as the official Remote Desktop client on my Mac.</p>
<p>Besides that, running Firefox, VS Code and a few other apps was a good experience, although the 4GB of RAM felt a bit cramped (some of the images I tried used <code>zram</code> swap) and SD card performance impacted loading times.</p>
<a id="anchor-benchmarks" href="https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2024/01/20/1800#benchmarks" rel="anchor"><h2 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h2></a><p>Once I got the <code>NVMe</code>, I got started on the main use case I had in mind for the board–understand how it would fare as a server, and how it would compare to both the <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/hw/raspberry_pi" rel="next">Raspberry Pi 4</a> and the <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2023/03/11/2000" rel="next">u59</a> mini-PC I have been using as part of <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2023/12/17/2000" rel="next">my homelab setup</a>.</p>
<p>And that typically involves two kinds of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heavy I/O (which is where the <code>NVMe</code> comes in)</li>
<li>Heavy CPU load (which is where the <code>RK3588</code>‘s extra cores come in)</li>
</ul>
<p>So I installed <a href="http://armbian.com/" rel="external">Armbian</a> onto a fresh SD card, booted off it, and then ran <code>armbian-config</code> and asked it to install onto <code>/dev/nvme0n1p1</code>–it cloned the SD install (merging <code>/boot</code> and <code>/</code> onto that partition) and updated the <code>SPI</code> flash (<code>mtdblock0</code>) to enable booting from the <code>NVMe</code>, which worked flawlessly.</p>
<a id="anchor-disk-i/o" href="https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2024/01/20/1800#disk-i/o" rel="anchor"><h3 id="disk-io">Disk I/O</h3></a><p>I then used <code>fio</code> to test the <code>NVMe</code> drive, and got the following results:</p>

<p>I found the <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2023/03/11/2000" rel="next">u59</a> results weird, so I ran the same test on my Intel i7-6700 (which also has <code>SATA</code> SSDs) and got a wider sample:</p>

<p>I’m a bit curious as to how a Raspberry Pi 5 would fare in this kind of testing (although I’d have to get one <em>and</em> an <code>NVMe</code> HAT, which would need to be factored in cost-wise), but I strongly suspect the <a href="http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-5-plus.html" rel="external">Orange Pi 5+</a> would still be faster.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I got some pushback <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39070730" rel="external">on HN</a> that I should have used <code>NVMe</code> drives on the Intel machines for comparison. My point here is that a) I tested with what I have (and I only added the i7 because I found the u59 results strange), and b) the u59 is within the general ballpark of the Orange Pi 5+ price-wise (as would likely be the i7-6700 second-hand, really), and mine shipped with <code>SATA</code> SSDs. I’m not trying to compare apples to oranges here, just trying to get a feel for how the Orange Pi 5+ compares to other machines I have lying around. Otherwise I’d go and benchmark it against my M2/M3 Macs or <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2023/02/18/1845" rel="next">my i7 13th gen</a>, which would be a bit silly.</p>

<a id="anchor-ollama-cpu-performance" href="https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2024/01/20/1800#ollama-cpu-performance" rel="anchor"><h3 id="ollama-cpu-performance">Ollama CPU Performance</h3></a><p>This is where things get interesting, because the <code>RK3588</code> has two sets of 4 cores and a lot of nominal horsepower, but I don’t plan on using it for conventional workloads, and most benchmarks are artificial anyway.</p>
<p>So I decided to run a few things that are more in line with what I do on a daily basis, and that I know are either CPU-bound or heavily dependent on overall system performance.</p>
<p>As it happens, <a href="https://ollama.ai/" rel="external">Ollama</a> is a great benchmark for what I have in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a “modern” real-world workload</li>
<li>It is very compute intensive (both in terms of math operations and general data processing)</li>
<li>It does not require I/O (the <code>NVMe</code> puts the <a href="http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-5-plus.html" rel="external">Orange Pi 5+</a> at an unfair advantage)</li>
<li>Tokens per second (averaged over several runs) is largely irrespective of the kind of question you ask (although it is very much model-dependent)</li>
</ul>
<p>However, I had to work around the memory constraints of the 4GB board again.</p>
<p>Since none of the “normal” models would fit, I had try and use smaller models for comparable results (the Raspberry Pi 4 I’m using has 8GB of RAM, and that’s enough to run quite a few more).</p>
<p><a href="https://ollama.ai/library/tinyllama" rel="external"><code>tinyllama</code></a> is a good baseline, but I also tried <a href="https://ollama.ai/library/dolphin-phi" rel="external"><code>dolphin-phi</code></a> because it is closer to the kind of models I work with.</p>
<p>I again had to resort to my <code>i7-6700</code>@3.4GHz for comparison because the <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2023/03/11/2000" rel="next">u59</a>‘s <code>N5105</code> CPU <a href="https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama/issues/644" rel="external">does not support all the required <code>AVX</code>/<code>AVX2</code> instructions</a>, but the results were pretty interesting nonetheless.</p>
<p>For each model, I ran the following prompt ten times<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2024/01/20/1800#fn:2" rel="anchor">2</a></sup>:</p>

<p>Looking solely at the <code>eval rate</code> (which is what matters for gauging the LLM performance speed-wise), I got these figures:</p>

<p>Keeping in mind that the <code>i7</code> runs at nearly <em>six times</em> the wattage, this is pretty good<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2024/01/20/1800#fn:3" rel="anchor">3</a></sup>, and the key point here is that the <a href="http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-5-plus.html" rel="external">Orange Pi 5+</a> generated the output at a usable pace–slower than what you’d get online from ChatGPT, but still fast enough that it is close to “reading speed”–whereas the Raspberry Pi 4 was too slow to be usable.</p>
<p>This also means I could probably (if I could find a suitable model that fit into 4GB RAM) use the <a href="http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-5-plus.html" rel="external">Orange Pi 5+</a> as a back-end for a “smart speaker” for my home automation setup (and I will probably try that in the future).</p>
<h3 id="onnxstream-combined-cpu-and-io-performance"><a href="https://github.com/vitoplantamura/OnnxStream" rel="external">OnnxStream</a> Combined CPU and I/O Performance</h3>
<p>Next up I decided to try <a href="https://github.com/vitoplantamura/OnnxStream" rel="external">OnnxStream</a>, which made the rounds a while back for allowing people to run <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2022/09/03/1400" rel="next">Stable Diffusion</a> on a Raspberry Pi… Zero.</p>
<p>As it turns out, it is a very interesting project, not just because it uses <code>ONNX</code> but also because it can run inference pretty much directly from storage (which is feasible for Stable Diffusion because it’s essentially scanning through the model “once” rather than doing multiple passes over various layers, which is what LLMs end up doing).</p>
<p>This is closer to the kind of workload I’m interested in, and even though it requires a lot of I/O (in which the <code>NVME</code> does give the <a href="http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-5-plus.html" rel="external">Orange Pi 5+</a> an unfair advantage), it is still a good test of the CPU’s ability to run inference.</p>
<p>So I built <a href="https://github.com/vitoplantamura/OnnxStream" rel="external">OnnxStream</a> from source on my test machines (except the <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2023/03/11/2000" rel="next">u59</a>, because <code>XNNPACK</code> really likes advanced instruction sets as well), downloaded the Stable Diffusion XL Turbo model, and ran the following command:</p>
<div><pre><span><code><span># time OnnxStream/src/build/sd --xl --turbo --rpi --models-path stable-diffusion-xl-turbo-1.0-onnxstream --steps 1 --seed 42</span>

steps:<span> </span><span>1</span>
seed:<span> </span><span>42</span>
...
</code></span></pre></div>
<p>You’ll notice that I only ran one step and that I used the <code>--rpi</code> flag, which <a href="https://github.com/vitoplantamura/OnnxStream/blob/master/src/sd.cpp#906" rel="external">turns off <code>fp16</code> arithmetic and splits attention</a> to make it run faster on the Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>I also ran <code>iotop</code> to see how much I/O was going on, and during the initial stages of each run I saw a lot of activity (which is to be expected, since the model is being loaded into memory and the first inference steps are being run). </p>
<p>As I expected, the <a href="http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-5-plus.html" rel="external">Orange Pi 5+</a> was able to sustain a throughput of 200MB/s when loading slices of the model, which is pretty good (the Pi 4 was only able to do about 60MB/s), but the overall run time was still partly CPU-bound, making it a more interesting test.</p>
<p>Since this took a good while to run<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2024/01/20/1800#fn:4" rel="anchor">4</a></sup> I only did it three times, and averaged the results:</p>

<p>Overall, the <a href="http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-5-plus.html" rel="external">Orange Pi 5+</a> was <em>three times faster</em> than the <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/hw/raspberry_pi" rel="next">Raspberry Pi 4</a> and half as fast as the Intel i7 under the same conditions, which confirms that with a little more RAM (and likely a little more patience and optimization) the <a href="http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-5-plus.html" rel="external">Orange Pi 5+</a> could run other kinds of models at a decent clip and with a great power envelope.</p>
<a id="anchor-jellyfin" href="https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2024/01/20/1800#jellyfin" rel="anchor"><h2 id="jellyfin">Jellyfin</h2></a><p>After all that, I decided to relocate the board to my server closet for a weekend and try something a bit more mundane–running a media server.</p>
<p>This is something that is of interest to most folk looking at <code>ARM</code> single board computers for home use, so I installed <code>docker</code> and set up a test <a href="https://jellyfin.org/" rel="external">Jellyfin</a> server using my <code>NAS</code> as a backend.</p>
<p>Even though <a href="https://jellyfin.org/" rel="external">Jellyfin</a> does not have any support for hardware transcoding on <code>ARM</code>, the overall experience was pretty good, at least with two simultaneous users–<a href="https://github.com/jellyfin/Swiftfin" rel="external">Swiftfin</a> and the Android TV client both worked snappily, and I was able to stream 4K content directly to both without any issues (again, this board is a bit overkill where it regards throughput).</p>
<p>Forcing transcoding on the server side was a bit more taxing, but I was able to get <code>HEVC</code> to <code>H.264</code> 1080p software transcoding going without any stuttering, and the 8 CPU cores were more than enough to handle the load–but I didn’t try more than two simultaneous streams, and I suspect that would be the limit.</p>
<a id="anchor-parenthesis-gpu-and-npu-support" href="https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2024/01/20/1800#parenthesis-gpu-and-npu-support" rel="anchor"><h3 id="parenthesis-gpu-and-npu-support">Parenthesis: GPU and NPU support</h3></a><p>At this point it bears noting that even though the <code>RK3588</code> has a <code>Mali-G610 MP4</code> GPU and a Neural Processing Unit, neither of those have the kind of support that, say, Intel QuickSync has for streaming, and that finding <em>anything</em> with support for the <code>NPU</code> was a bit of a challenge–which was another reason for me taking a break from normal benchmarking and trying something more mundane.</p>
<p>I did manage to get <a href="https://www.hackster.io/Mixtile/how-to-change-the-rk-yolov5-demo-to-capture-real-time-camera-d24f38" rel="external">an OpenCV YOLO demo going</a> with a USB webcam, but <code>ARM</code> software is still thin on the ground, and the expertise to improve it as well. In particular, <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/issues/1557" rel="external">this thread</a> taught me a lot about the <code>NPU</code>’s limitations. It isn’t as “wide” as a <code>GPU</code> for the kind of mainstream AI work I’m interested in, so there’s really no way to use it for LLMs or other large models. </p>
<p>But I’m positive I can get <code>whisper.cpp</code> running on it, which I’ll try via <a href="https://github.com/usefulsensors/useful-transformers" rel="external"><code>useful-transformers</code></a> once I have a little more time.</p>

<p>Again to compensate for the limited 4GB RAM on my board, I enabled <code>swap</code> for the extra partition I created and set up <code>LVM</code> on the rest of the disk.</p>
<p>From then on, installing <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/os/linux/distributions/proxmox" rel="next">Proxmox</a> was just a matter of following <a href="https://github.com/jiangcuo/Proxmox-Port/wiki/Install-Proxmox-VE-on-Debian-bookworm" rel="external">the wiki instructions</a>, making sure the <code>LVM</code> arrangement was correct (you need to create the <code>pve</code> volume group, etc.) and joining it to my cluster:</p>

<p>All the basics worked (other than device management, which I’ll come to in a second, it worked just as well as my other servers), and besides cloning some of the <code>ARM</code> containers I had already on my Pi I was able to set up a few new containers and VMs without any issues–although, again, the 4GB RAM was a little limiting when using VMs, so I mostly stuck to <code>LXC</code> containers.</p>

<figcaption>It works a lot better with the right clock, too</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>An interesting quirk I noticed with the <a href="http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-5-plus.html" rel="external">Orange Pi 5+</a> is that the emulated real-time clock was off by a couple of centuries<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2024/01/20/1800#fn:5" rel="anchor">5</a></sup>, which causes no end of trouble–CPU usage went through the roof as Windows services tripped over themselves to check certificates and other things, and the VM was very sluggish.</p>
<p>But once I set it to the correct date and time, everything worked fine and was very usable even when logging in via Remote Desktop. And, of course, the Intel emulation worked fine–I installed XMind, and it held its own even when bumping the remote window to full screen on my large displays.</p>
<a id="anchor-device-passthrough" href="https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2024/01/20/1800#device-passthrough" rel="anchor"><h3 id="device-passthrough">Device Passthrough</h3></a><p>Thanks to the magic of <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/os/linux/distributions/proxmox" rel="next">Proxmox</a>, migrating the Windows VM to my <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/hw/raspberry_pi" rel="next">Raspberry Pi 4</a> and back was an automatic process, as was cloning my <a href="https://www.portainer.io/" rel="external">Portainer</a> setup from the Pi and running it on the <a href="http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-5-plus.html" rel="external">Orange Pi 5+</a>.</p>
<p>I couldn’t get <code>PCI</code> passthrough to work, though–which makes sense since Proxmox isn’t really ARM-aware right now, and I suspect that both the shipped <code>QEMU</code> version and the 5.10 kernel don’t have the necessary bits to make <code>VFIO</code> work (I’ve lost track of the kernel work for that sometime last year, and haven’t been able to find good updates).</p>
<p>So passing through network cards to a virtual router like <a href="https://ipfire.org/" rel="external">IPFire</a> is out of the question for now, although I suspect I can finagle a way to do it with the Proxmox <code>SDN</code> settings (or perhaps an USB adapter).</p>
<a id="anchor-conclusion" href="https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2024/01/20/1800#conclusion" rel="anchor"><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2></a><p>With an <code>NVMe</code> drive, the <a href="http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-5-plus.html" rel="external">Orange Pi 5+</a> is a little beast of a machine, and extremely good bang for the watt–besides my very specific interests, it is a very capable board that can be used for a lot of things, and I think a 16GB unit (let alone the new 32GB version) would be more than good enough to be a quiet, low-consumption (yet pretty powerful) homelab server.</p>
<p>And that applies even without <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/os/linux/distributions/proxmox" rel="next">Proxmox</a>–all you’d need is <a href="https://www.portainer.io/" rel="external">Portainer</a> and a few containers, although of course you’d have to be mindful that <code>ARM</code> support for some things is still a bit spotty.</p>
<p>Given that I have been running a few VMs and a bunch of development containers on a <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/hw/raspberry_pi" rel="next">Rasbperry Pi 4</a> for a while now, I’m certain the <a href="http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-5-plus.html" rel="external">Orange Pi 5+</a> is able to handle the same workload with margin to spare (except for the 4GB RAM, of course). And it is a lot more flexible in terms of I/O and display options, although I do think a <code>SATA</code> port (or two) would be a nice addition.</p>
<p>As a thin client, it is also pretty good–just as capable as the <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2023/03/11/2000" rel="next">u59</a> was, but with less power consumption and an equivalent set of I/O options with full-size display connectors (which is a plus for me).</p>
<p>And speaking of the <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2023/03/11/2000" rel="next">u59</a>, I was a bit surprised that I wasn’t able to run <a href="https://ollama.ai/" rel="external">Ollama</a> on it (the lack of <code>AVX</code>/<code>AVX2</code> support caught me by surprise), and it makes me wonder how much better Intel’s new <code>N100</code> CPU would be–and how the scales would tip versus <code>ARM</code> CPUs.</p>
<p>Regardless, I expect to migrate my home automation setup to the <a href="http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-5-plus.html" rel="external">Orange Pi 5+</a> in the future (once I’ve tried using it as a voice assistant and played with the <code>HDMI</code> input, which will require a side quest into setting up Android), and I’m looking forward to see if kernel 6.x support improves things further.</p>
<p>It would be so nice to have more RAM, though.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<!-- Ad-Auris -->
		

		<p><span>I</span> <span>recently travelled</span> to Italy, and the first pleasure of every meal there was reading the menu. Phrases like “risotto al nero di seppia, burrata e ricci di mare”— risotto with cuttlefish ink, burrata, and sea urchins—and “paccheri pestati cunzati con gamberi, pistacchi e bisque”—paccheri pasta with crushed seasonings and with shrimp, pistachio, and bisque—felt like a rich prelude to the food itself. On a rooftop patio in Florence, I was handed both the regular menu and a supplementary sheet of paper. I happened to be there during white truffle season, and the sheet of paper listed all of the dishes they made with the delicacy. I sat there, literally under the Tuscan sun, feeling like a character in a book—one that was very unlike my everyday self. </p>

<p>One of the chief pleasures I get from reading is in poring over the descriptions of <a href="https://thewalrus.ca/tag/food/">food</a>. Give me a banquet scene or a dinner party where the wine pairs perfectly with both the entrée and whatever dramatic revelation is about to come, and I am rapt. Battle scenes bore me, but reading a character’s grocery list enchants me. Maybe that’s why I love restaurant menus so much—a well-written one can feel like a piece of literature in and of itself. </p>
<p>Part of the magic of those Italian meals was not just in reading the menus but in encountering them as physical objects, feeling their weight in my hands and touching the grain of their paper. There was a world of difference from the last menu I’d encountered in North America, which had to be accessed via QR code. That meal had been at a nice restaurant, with flowers on every table and friendly service, but having to begin my meal by squinting at a smudgy screen did somewhat take away from the experience. </p>

<p>QR codes, or quick response codes, aren’t new—they’ve been around since 1994, though they weren’t initially widely adopted outside of Asia. During the pandemic, their ability to offer contact-free interactions led to a rise in their use in the rest of the world, including at restaurants. But even as more and more restrictions were dropped, many of the QR code menus stayed. Hospitality Technology’s <a href="https://hospitalitytech.com/2022-restaurant-technology-study" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2022 Restaurant Technology Study</a> reported that 66 percent of restaurants in the US used QR code menus, and 19 percent of restaurants planned on adding them. The stats for Canadian restaurants are similar, according to the <em>Toronto Star</em>, which <a href="https://www.thestar.com/business/pandemic-gives-qr-codes-a-second-wind-in-the-food-industry/article_c6a56065-81e1-582d-8f53-1755d6ea54d7.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pointed</a> to a Dalhousie University survey that indicated three out of every five Canadians used QR codes at restaurants or grocery stores in August 2021.</p>
<p>My complaints with QR code menus are minor but many. I love the communal aspect of dining out with friends or family, and I hate the way that QR code menus take me out of the shared moment and force me to look at my phone (which, of course, leads me down the rabbit hole of checking my various notifications). I hate the way QR code menus mean scrolling, pinching to adjust size, and sometimes juggling between multiple tabs instead of just having to glance over a page or two. </p>

<p>There are larger issues too: websites with menus on them can track consumer behaviour, one more tiny erosion of our everyday privacy. QR code menus also mean that people need access to a smart phone or some other kind of device and, if they do have one, that they possess a certain level of tech savviness, which excludes some potential patrons.      And as Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-06-18/did-the-pandemic-kill-off-the-restaurant-menu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported in 2021</a>, technology that promotes contactless dining has already been linked to job losses in the service industry.</p>
<p>I’m not alone in my dislike of QR codes. In 2022, Conor Friedersdorf wrote an <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/10/qr-code-menus-restaurants-pandemic/671888/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">impassioned polemic</a> against them for <em>The Atlantic</em>, and in 2023, the <em>New York Times</em> published an article on their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/22/dining/restaurant-qr-code-menu.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">alleged demise</a>, full of quotes from people who loathe them. Even a brief search for the term “QR code menu” on X (formerly known as Twitter) will show you how deeply unpopular they are—one of my favourites, from user @mlokeshceo, simply says, “Menu &gt; QR code.” Succinct and true!</p>
<p>Physical menus are more than just aesthetically pleasing; they can also serve as important historical documents. The New York Public Library has approximately 45,000 menus dating from the 1840s, a collection that they’re in the process of digitizing through their “<a href="https://menus.nypl.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">What’s on the menu?</a>” project, and it’s amazing how much can be gleaned from those documents. The first and most obvious piece of information is what people were eating in a particular time and place—along with how much (or little) they paid for it. One of the menus in the NYPL’s collection is from Mart Ackerman’s Saloon in Toronto, where, back in 1856, diners could get a porterhouse steak with a choice of sides for $0.50—about $12 in today’s terms—accompanied by a glass of Siberian cobbler, ladies’ fancy punch, or a cocktail simply called the eye opener, all priced $0.13—$1.50 today—or under. But there’s so much more that can be learned from these menus beyond just items and prices.</p>
<p>“I think the menus are really important because they’re archival traces of what people are eating, or what people are purchasing, or have the opportunity to purchase,” says writer and cultural historian L. Sasha Gora. “They tell so many different histories. These can be environmental histories—so, really thinking about how certain ingredients disappear, or reappear, or appear to begin with.”</p>
<p>Gora leads a research group at the University of Augsburg dedicated to the culinary environmental humanities. Among other themes, the group has explored the idea of culinary extinction—namely, what happens when the animals and plants used for a popular food go extinct because we have eaten them out of existence? Take the passenger pigeon, for example, which died out in the early twentieth century thanks to overhunting. As it was going nearly extinct, you would think it would be disappearing from restaurant menus too. And yet, as passenger pigeon numbers rapidly declined, passenger pigeon pie was still on the menu, according to Gora, at the storied Delmonico’s Restaurant in New York City. Gora says it’s possible that the pie really did contain passenger pigeon meat, but it’s also possible that it was the meat of some other, more common pigeon. Either way, the menu gave customers a perception of abundance even as their appetites decimated the ecology around them.</p>

<p>Menus can also give us insight into attitudes toward gender. One fascinating example from history is the so-called “ladies’ menu”—a menu printed without prices so that women wouldn’t know how much their dates were spending on them (the practice mostly disappeared after a California woman threatened a restaurant with a discrimination lawsuit). Gora has an example relating to gender and menus from her own life too. In an essay titled “<a href="https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/foodstudies/chapter/reading-menus/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Today’s Special: Reading Menus as Cultural Texts</a>,” she recalls working as a cook at a restaurant that served two versions of the same meal: “The Dirty Brunch” and “The Clean Brunch.” “The Dirty” came with bacon and sausages and, her boss told her, tended to be ordered by men; “The Clean,” by contrast, came with hummus and salad and tended to be ordered by women. </p>
<p>But most of all, menus tell us about things that are ephemeral: foods, yes, but also often the places that serve that food as well. “A restaurant opens, and then it can run for a while, and then it closes, and then there are very few traces left,” says Gora. “So you don’t know what foods were being served, you don’t know how they were being contextualized. But if you have a menu, it actualizes the food, it preserves what was happening in the restaurant.”</p>
<p>I can’t imagine that lunch in Florence would have been quite as thrilling if, instead of holding the leatherbound wine list in my hands and running my finger down the (extensive) inventory of options, the server had directed me toward the QR code for a digital menu. That meal was a moment—with perfect weather, a view of the Ponte Vecchio, and the strongest negroni I’ve ever had the good fortune to come across—and I’m glad that I was able to be fully in it, no screens involved. And if any future historians are wondering, the ravioli with fresh white truffles was worth every penny.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Transformer based Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely used in many fields, and the efficiency of LLM inference becomes hot topic in real applications. However, LLMs are usually complicatedly designed in model structure with massive operations and perform inference in the auto-regressive mode, making it a challenging task to design a system with high efficiency.
<br>In this paper, we propose an efficient LLM inference solution with low latency and high throughput. Firstly, we simplify the LLM decoder layer by fusing data movement and element-wise operations to reduce the memory access frequency and lower system latency. We also propose a segment KV cache policy to keep key/value of the request and response tokens in separate physical memory for effective device memory management, helping enlarge the runtime batch size and improve system throughput. A customized Scaled-Dot-Product-Attention kernel is designed to match our fusion policy based on the segment KV cache solution. We implement our LLM inference solution on Intel GPU and publish it publicly. Compared with the standard HuggingFace implementation, the proposed solution achieves up to 7x lower token latency and 27x higher throughput for some popular LLMs on Intel GPU.

It also shut off the training opportunities for future educators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response, states instituted a variety of short-term waivers allowing candidates to teach without fulfilling their normal requirements. Those policies helped candidates who would have otherwise been prevented from teaching, while aiding school leaders in filling open positions.</p>



<p>Were teachers worse for this lack of training?&nbsp;</p>







<p>New research from <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2023/11/15/report-massachusetts-teachers-emergency-license-quality?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=wheelock_social">Massachusetts</a> and <a href="https://caldercenter.org/sites/default/files/CALDER%20WP%20286-0623.pdf">New Jersey</a> suggests maybe not. In both states, teachers who entered the profession without completing the full requirements performed no worse than their normally trained peers.</p>



<p>Starting June 2020, Massachusetts began temporarily letting anyone with a bachelor’s degree teach. According to <a href="https://wheelockpolicycenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Emergency-License-Y1-Report.pdf">data compiled</a> by a team of researchers at Boston University, roughly 5,800 individuals received one of these emergency licenses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like other first-year teachers, those granted emergency credentials were disproportionately assigned to work with children with disabilities, English learners and low-income students. And, in fact, they had more such children in their classrooms. Even so, their students saw <a href="https://wheelockpolicycenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Emergency-License-Y2-Report.pdf">about the same rate of growth</a> in math and reading as children taught by regularly licensed educators. Because most did not teach tested grades and subjects, the researchers also looked at evaluation ratings. Both groups of teachers received similar marks from their supervisors.</p>



<p>When the Boston University team asked principals and administrators why they hired emergency-certified teachers, they reported using them to fill shortage areas, especially in special education.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The teachers working under these licenses also helped diversify the state’s classrooms, as they were about twice as likely as other beginning educators to be Black, Hispanic or Asian.</p>



<p>New Jersey’s waiver policy was similar. Candidates could earn a temporary credential before passing the normal licensure exams or completing a teacher preparation program. The licenses were good for one year, at which point candidates would need to go back, pass the tests and complete their training. Still, <a href="https://caldercenter.org/sites/default/files/CALDER%20WP%20286-0623.pdf">researchers Ben Backes and Dan Goldhaber</a> found similar outcomes as in Massachusetts: Teachers without the normal training and testing were at least as effective in reading and math as other novices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One preliminary explanation from the New Jersey study was that the emergency licensed teachers were working in schools that had a record of helping students make strong academic gains. It’s possible that the schools had supports in place, such as teacher coaching, a strong curriculum or something else that compensated for less training.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another recent study, out of Oakland, California, backs up this theory. Parents with high school diplomas who were given 10 weeks of training on a structured literacy program <a href="https://www.the74million.org/article/oakland-study-finds-parents-as-effective-as-teachers-in-tutoring-young-readers/">helped students produce</a> strong early literacy gains, roughly on par with those made under fully credentialed teachers.&nbsp;</p>







<p>The better question now is why these temporary waivers aren’t being made permanent. The New Jersey policy <a href="https://www.nj.gov/education/covid19/teacherresources/instructionalCEtemp.shtml">expired</a> after one year, and Massachusetts is trying to <a href="https://www.doe.mass.edu/licensure/emergency/">phase</a> its version out this year. But with such promising results, policymakers might want to reconsider.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The results are, in fact,&nbsp;part of a pendulum swing in teacher preparation. A decade ago, states were trying to raise the bar. The supply of <a href="https://www.educationnext.org/why-are-fewer-people-becoming-teachers/">new educators</a> had risen steadily throughout the 1990s and 2000s, and there was a regular <a href="https://caldercenter.org/sites/default/files/CALDER%20Policy%20Brief%203-1116-1.pdf">surplus</a> of teacher candidates. There were regional and subject-area shortages, of course, but in general, school districts could be choosy about whom they hired.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given this backdrop, policymakers of all stripes came together to focus on quality over quantity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>National leaders like then-Secretary of Education <a href="https://www.tc.columbia.edu/articles/2009/october/arne-duncan-full-transcript/">Arne Duncan</a> and American Federation of Teachers President <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/union-calls-teacher-certification-exam-143329056.html">Randi Weingarten</a> pushed for higher barriers to entering the profession. At the same time, the national accrediting bodies charged with overseeing teacher preparation programs pushed <a href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/merged-ncate-likely-to-raise-teacher-entry-bar/2011/12">new standards</a> of quality. And states adopted tougher licensing exams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Did these policies work? That’s a mixed bag at best.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s some evidence that teacher licensure tests are <a href="https://caldercenter.org/publications/evaluating-prospective-teachers-testing-predictive-validity-edtpa-update">mildly accurate</a> <a href="https://caldercenter.org/publications/teacher-licensure-tests-barrier-or-predictive-tool">predictors</a> of who will be a good educator. All else equal, a school would be better off selecting candidates with a higher test score, especially if they’re going to be teaching math or science. But that general rule would <a href="https://www.educationnext.org/what-does-it-mean-to-raise-the-bar-for-entry-into-the-teaching-profession/">mischaracterize</a> a lot of teachers — some test well but don’t have great classroom management or interpersonal skills, while others may not test well but are effective at working with children.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s undoubtedly true is that making it harder to become a teacher reduced the supply. Researchers found that the adoption of <a href="https://www.edworkingpapers.com/sites/default/files/ai21-440.pdf">a new teacher licensure test called the edTPA</a> reduced the supply by 14%, disproportionately hitting minority candidates in less selective or minority-concentrated universities. Another new <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4644356">working paper</a> finds that in 21 states and D.C., shifting to the Praxis Core as their licensure test in 2013-14 led to a 12.5% decrease in teacher preparation completions.</p>



<p>In other words, making it harder to become a teacher will reduce the supply but offers <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED567813.pdf">no guarantee</a> that those who meet the bar will actually be effective in the classroom. The recent COVID-related waivers should cause policymakers to re-evaluate whether barriers into the teaching profession actually serve a meaningful purpose, or if they’re keeping potentially talented educators out of the classroom.&nbsp;</p>
