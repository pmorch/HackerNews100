<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Swedish Tesla employees have gone on strike, and unions in neighboring Denmark and Norway have joined boycotts of Elon Musk's electric automaker.</p>
<p>Danish union 3F and Norway's Fellesforbundet, the largest private-sector unions in their respective nations, both announced plans this week to get in Tesla's way.</p>
<p>3F, which covers multiple industries in Denmark, has limited its sympathy strike to its Transportation arm, which union chair Jan Villadsen explained will mean transportation workers at docks, including drivers, won't unload or transport Tesla vehicles bound for Sweden.</p>

    

<p>"Even though Elon Musk is one of the richest people in the world and owns Tesla, he can't just make his own rules," Villadsen <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jan.g.villadsen/posts/669001345216182" rel="nofollow">declared</a> on Tuesday when announcing 3F's action. "We have some agreements on the labor market in the Nordics, and you have to comply with them if you want to do business here."</p>

        


        

<p>Fellesforbundet leader Jørn Eggum echoed Villadsen's sentiments in a Wednesday <a href="https://www.fellesforbundet.no/aktuelt/nyheter/2023/varsler-tesla-boikott/" rel="nofollow">announcement</a> that his union will also launch a boycott aimed at stopping the transportation of Teslas into Sweden.</p>
<p>"In the Nordic countries, there is broad agreement about the importance of a well-organized working life," Eggum noted. "The right to demand a collective agreement is a natural part of [that], and we cannot accept that Tesla stands outside this."</p>

        

<p>3F and Fellesforbundet's sympathy strikes will begin on December 19 and December 20, respectively, if a collective agreement between Tesla and employees represented by Swedish automotive worker union IF Metall isn't in place.</p>
<p>IF Metall workers in Sweden – where Tesla doesn't manufacture vehicles but has a number of repair and service shops – have been <a href="https://www.ifmetall.se/aktuellt/tesla/" rel="nofollow">on strike</a> since October after what they described as years of Tesla refusing to bargain with the union. IF Metall-represented employees claim Tesla hasn't guaranteed them good wages, a pension or insurance.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/28/us_labor_board_tesla/">Tesla ran over worker rights, again, US labor judge finds</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Tesla has long refused to bargain with unions, with CEO Elon Musk recently <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/30/musk_murders_x/">opining</a> that he disagrees with the entire concept of organized labor, as you can see below.</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sctgA2qa-rA" data-media="x-videoplayer">Youtube Video</a>
</p>
<p>"I just don't like anything which creates a lords and peasants sort of thing," the world's richest man told the <em>New York Times</em> DealBook Summit. "I think the unions naturally try to create negativity in a company." He added "If Tesla gets unionized it will be because we deserved it, and because we failed in some way."</p>

        

<p>Unions across Sweden have <a href="https://www.ifmetall.se/aktuellt/tesla/darfor-tvingas-if-metall-att-strejka/sympatiatgarder-fran-andra-fackforbund/" rel="nofollow">banded together</a> to cripple Tesla. Swedish port workers have pledged to block imports, electricians have refused to work on damaged Tesla chargers or at the vehicle builder's facilities, painters and builders have declined to work for Elon's products and properties.</p>
<p>Postal workers even decided not to deliver mail to the electric automaker, including license plates – an action that Musk called "<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1727564977869844865?s=20" rel="nofollow">insane</a>". The local court has since <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/27/tesla_sweden_strike_lawsuit/">put a stop</a> to that action.</p>
<p>It's unknown whether Tesla plans to take further action to stop the strikes, or whether it'll cut its losses and bargain with employees – we asked, but didn't hear back. ®</p>

		    <h3><strong>Investors smell the money, billions are flowing, even in the US, which could become major lithium producer.</strong></h3>
<h4>By&nbsp;<a href="https://wolfstreet.com/author/wolf-richter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wolf Richter</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="https://wolfstreet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WOLF STREET</a>.</h4>
<p>Who needs fundamentals when you have rampant speculation? And then you can make up a story that fits the speculative narrative, and everyone will jump in, and you’re off to the races. That’s what commodities are all about from time to time. They’re so much fun.</p>
<p>The spot price of battery-grade lithium carbonate, trading in Shanghai and serving as a benchmark, dropped today to CNY 133,500 per tonne, down 77% from the peak a year ago, and below where it had been in 2017.</p>
<p>It had spiked by 1,410% from CNY 39,500 per tonne in August 2020 to CNY 600,000 in November 2022, multiplying by 15 in about 27 months, <em>WHOOSH</em>. The narrative to support the speculative craze was, you guessed it, lithium shortage. But high prices brought lots of new production online. The best cure for high prices is high prices. And soon the new and improved narrative was that there was a lithium glut. And today roughly completes the first full year of a most spectacular collapse in prices.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/US-lithium-carbonate-2023-11-23.png" alt="" width="784" height="581" srcset="https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/US-lithium-carbonate-2023-11-23.png 784w, https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/US-lithium-carbonate-2023-11-23-560x415.png 560w, https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/US-lithium-carbonate-2023-11-23-768x569.png 768w, https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/US-lithium-carbonate-2023-11-23-260x193.png 260w, https://wolfstreet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/US-lithium-carbonate-2023-11-23-160x119.png 160w" sizes="(max-width: 784px) 100vw, 784px"></p>
<p>We already had a lithium bubble followed by an implosion a few years ago: The prior lithium bubble peaked in 2017, at CNY 175,000, and imploded over the next three years, with the price dropping 77% to CNY 39,500 by August 2020.</p>
<p>Inevitably, when you have so much fun, something even more fun happens: A startup company, Stardust Power, announced on November 21 that it would go public – and you also guessed this – via merger with a SPAC. With the money it expects to raise in the SPAC merger, it will build its first lithium refinery. It already picked out a “shovel-ready” location near Tulsa, OK, to build the lithium refinery and then to supply the EV battery industry.</p>
<p>This Stardust Power announcement comes after the stocks of EV SPACs and a bunch of other companies that had gone public via merger with a SPAC have totally collapsed and entered my pantheon of <a href="https://wolfstreet.com/category/all/imploded-stocks/">Imploded Stocks</a>. So good luck.</p>
<p>Obviously, there is a lot of demand for battery-grade lithium to go into the batteries for the global EV production boom, and thankfully, lithium is abundant around the world and in the US.</p>
<p>In September, we were treated to this headline: “Lithium deposit found in US may be among world’s largest, study finds.” The area is in Nevada. But in the US, permitting issues, local opposition, legal challenges, and costs don’t exactly make starting up lithium production a cakewalk.</p>
<p>Then there is the long-running Lithium Nevada’s $2.3 billion project, which, after overcoming a host of issues, including legal challenges from tribes, is now on schedule to begin production in late 2026 at what could be one of the largest lithium mines in the world.</p>
<p>The big kahuna of the oil-and-gas industry, Exxon Mobil, announced earlier in November that it plans to produce lithium from briny water pumped up from about 10,000 feet in the Smackover Formation in Arkansas. Production is expected to start by 2027 and will eventually supply lithium for well over 1 million EVs per year, according to Reuters. It cited analysts at TD Cowen that estimated this would require Exxon Mobil to invest $2 billion. So that’s going to be good for the economy.</p>
<p>Lithium production at the Salton Sea in California has been kicked around for years. The area has been dubbed Lithium Valley due to its lithium-rich geothermal activity. Three companies are now working on projects using a new technology of extraction that is still largely unproven at scale. Two of the three – BHE Renewables and EnergySource Minerals – own and operate geothermal powerplants in the area, and that’s a pretty good fit. So we’ll see.</p>
<p>All kinds of lithium production projects are being worked on in the US and around the world. Currently, Australia, Chile, and China dominate lithium production. Australia alone accounts for nearly half the global production. The three combined account for about 90% of global production. Everyone is now trying to get in on it. Investors have smelled the money, and the billions are flowing.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      <h2><a href="https://blog.pgpkeys.eu/">pgpkeys-eu.github.io</a></h2>
      

      


<p>A proposed fork of the OpenPGP standard, called “LibrePGP” and initiated by GnuPG’s maintainer Werner Koch, has made a series of statements on its own website<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> in order to justify its existence. Some of these criticisms have merit, but most are misleading at best. We address the points raised individually here.</p>

<h2 id="the-critique">The Critique</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The IETF OpenPGP Working Group (WG) at some point decided to give up on its charter to produce an updated specification and instead started to re-invent that standard.
Whether this is in line with IETF rules is questionable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The crypto-refresh draft<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and LibrePGP<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> are both backwards-compatible with RFC4880, RFC5581, and RFC6687.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> Neither of them attempt to re-invent any existing standard. Crypto-refresh leaves out many extensions that are included in LibrePGP, in part because the Working Group was <em>not</em> willing to overstep the limitations of the current charter.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> Items included in LibrePGP that were intentionally left out of crypto-refresh include:<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>Restricted Encryption key flag</li>
  <li>Timestamping usage key flag</li>
  <li>Attested Key Signatures</li>
  <li>Attested Certifications subpacket</li>
  <li>Key Block subpacket</li>
</ul>

<p>These proposed extensions to OpenPGP are compatible with the crypto-refresh draft, and can be specified at a future date once the WG is re-chartered.<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Considering that new features and discussions for larger updates of the specification delayed a new RFC for many years and were the reason for closing the WG in 2017 and re-opening in 2020,
we proposed to go back to the last commonly agreed upon draft or to conclude the WG on the grounds that no rough consensus could be found.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rough consensus <em>was</em> found; LibrePGP dissents from it.<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> And one thing that the majority of the WG can agree upon was that the “last commonly agreed upon draft” was not agreed upon at all.</p>

<h2 id="01-symmetric-mode">01 Symmetric Mode</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>It seems that this new scheme was introduced for the benefit of allowing GCM as yet another encryption mode.
GCM is a counter mode and, as can be seen by the large changes required, is hard to get right.
Meanwhile we have GCM in CMS (the core of S/MIME) because Microsoft decided to go this way.
However, OpenPGP has made its decisions based on technical soundness and not based on larger vendor, government, or committee decision.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the strongest concern that LibrePGP has raised. GCM is hard to get right, but it is widely implemented and its limitations are well-understood.<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">10</a></sup> Anyone who needs to support GCM in OpenPGP has a large number of well-tested libraries to choose from. Anyone who does not need GCM is not required to implement anything. GCM is OPTIONAL.<sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The WG once decided to go with OCB and EAX. EAX was only added to avoid possible patent problems.
However, in the 4.5 years since the introduction of EAX, the OCB patent expired.
Thus, there is no more reason to reject OCB, and it should be declared as a RECOMMENDED mode with the intention to make it a MUST mode in some future OpenPGP.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This paragraph is beside the point, since OCB is already a MUST mode in the OpenPGP crypto-refresh.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It can also be expected that FIPS-140 will eventually allow OCB.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps, but this is speculation, and no date is suggested.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our suggestion was: Drop all the new AEAD ideas and use what has been deployed and agreed upon in the OpenPGP WG a long time ago.
Further, turn OCB into MUST WG a long time ago. Further, turn OCB into MUST and EAX into MAY (only for backward compatibility with deployed implementations).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, this is <em>already the case</em> in crypto-refresh:<sup id="fnref:12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">12</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>9.6. AEAD Algorithms 
…
Implementations MUST implement OCB. Implementations MAY implement EAX, GCM and other algorithms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>LibrePGP’s concerns are genuine, but have already been addressed.<sup id="fnref:8:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="02-padding-packet">02 Padding Packet</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>A padding packet is introduced with the idea to mitigate traffic analysis.
However, it is suggested to use random data for the content of this packet and thus this packet opens a huge covert channel.
This is especially concerning for institutional users efforts regarding Data Leak Prevention (DLP).
Suggestions to use padding based on a verifiable seed, were rejected despite that this is the standard method to do padding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OpenPGP already contains numerous potential covert channels.<sup id="fnref:13" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">13</a></sup> Unencrypted padding packets are in many ways <em>safer</em> than those other covert channels, because they are obvious and can (if necessary) be detected and/or removed at e.g. a gateway appliance. The choice of whether to allow padding packets in a given context can still be made at the application layer.</p>

<p>The proposal to mandate verifiable-seed padding was considered in the WG, but consensus could not be reached.<sup id="fnref:14" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">14</a></sup> Many details of how it would work in practice remain unclear.<sup id="fnref:15" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup> Updated guidance for how best to generate padding can still be issued at a later date if consensus is forthcoming.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This padding idea has come up in discussion every once in a while over the last 25 years and has always been rejected
because it does not belong into the encryption layer but into the application (plaintext) layer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not always true. For example, when downloading keys from a keystore, OpenPGP <em>is</em> the application layer. It is not clear for example how else to implement padding in WKD, which only serves binary TPKs.<sup id="fnref:16" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="03-changes-to-the-ecdh-encryption">03 Changes to the ECDH Encryption</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>ECDH is the standard way to do encryption with elliptic curves.
For OpenPGP ECDH has been specified in RFC-6637 from 2012 and been implemented by PGP and GnuPG even a year earlier.
Instead of keeping this solid specification some details have been changed without a sound reason.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only change to ECDH is that instead of using OpenPGP-specific OIDs to identify ECDH curves (which were never intended to be permanent OID allocations), the new crypto-refresh will use industry-standard OIDs (in v6 packets <em>only</em>).<sup id="fnref:17" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="04-proliferation-for-algorithms">04 Proliferation for Algorithms</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new draft not only allow the use of GCM as a third encryption mode but adds a couple of other required algorithms:</p>

  <p>HKDF
   Argon2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>HKDF and Argon2 were added to address several known and potential weaknesses in the cryptographic layer of OpenPGP.<sup id="fnref:18" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">18</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:19" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">19</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:20" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">20</a></sup>
LibrePGP does not acknowledge the existence of these issues.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Optional modes (EAX, OCB, GCM, and a way to define even more)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OpenPGP has always been highly extensible, so it’s unclear what the specific objection is here (aside from GCM, which we address elsewhere).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Werner Koch joined the AES conference in 2000 on Phil Zimmermann’s wish to talk about algorithm proliferation.
They agreed on pushing the forthcoming AES along with their MDC extension, get Twofish and so out of the focus, and in general resist to add new algorithms.
That is for the simple reason that neither PGP nor GnuPG wanted to maintain all new algorithms until eternity.</p>

  <p>Later, they had to do a political compromise to allow Camellia for the use in Japan and Brainpool curves for European use.
We should really stick to this and not support algorithms which are just a substitute for existing crypto building blocks.
Since added complexity makes a review harder and the larger codebase has to be maintained indefinitely for backwards compatibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This appears to say that it was OK to make a political compromise for the benefit of users who have to comply with some national regulations, but for some reason it is not OK to make a political compromise for the sake of users who have to comply with other national regulations. It might be fair to say that Werner regrets his previous decision and has decided not to repeat that mistake, but that is his personal viewpoint. Others obviously disagree.</p>

<p>Supporting extra algorithms comes at a cost. Whether this cost is “justifiable” is to some extent subjective. Some people think the cost of including GCM is too high, which is fair. If so, they are not required to implement GCM, since GCM is OPTIONAL.<sup id="fnref:11:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="05-removal-of-useful-real-world-features">05 Removal of Useful Real-world Features</h2>

<p>OpenPGP is a long-established standard and has accumulated many features over time. It is good practice to deprecate features that have been found to not work as intended, even if they are useful in theory.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, in 2016 an m flag was introduced to indicate that the plaintext shall be interpreted as MIME data.
This has been removed along with deprecating the traditional t flag to distinguish between binary and text data.
Having the ability to easily detect MIME data is for example required to process attachments from web mail clients or in air-gaped environments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>t</code> flag was deprecated because it did not specify which character set was being used. UTF-8 has long been the standard encoding in OpenPGP, and all “text” usage is therefore already covered by <code>u</code>.<sup id="fnref:21" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:21" rel="footnote">21</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The designated revoker feature has also been deprecated with the rationale that a better method is to achieve this with an “escrowed” revocation, pre-created by the user.
In fact, GnuPG creates such a revocation certificate since version 2.1 (released in 2014), to mitigate the common problem of a forgotten password.
But this is not a replacement for corporate needs: the designated revoker is an important feature to manage a large scale deployments of OpenPGP keys and acts as a CRL (certificate revocation list) replacement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No evidence is given that escrowed revocations are less suited to a corporate environment. Escrowed revocations are simple to reason over, and have been supported for decades. By contrast, designated revokers increase the complexity of validity calculations considerably - you cannot be sure if a key has been revoked by looking at the signatures on the key itself, but instead need to have a copy of the revoker’s key, which may not be immediately available. And what happens if the designated revoker’s key is itself revoked?</p>

<h2 id="06-removal-of-security-fixes">06 Removal of Security Fixes</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Due to an implementation bug in PGP 5, the metadata of a signed file was not covered by the signatures.
RFC-4880 didn’t fix that for backward compatibility.
However, users were often surprised when they learned that the shown filename and file data could be changed while keeping the signature intact.
With the introduction of the new v5 signature packet format, the opportunity to fix that was taken.</p>

  <p>However, the crypto-refresh group then introduced v6 signatures and removed the fix (see this commit)
with the flimsy explanation that the way to populate that the field is not clear in a theoretical encrypt-then-sign scenario
and that signatures could not be detached and reattached (which is obvioulsy wrong).
A later proposed fix for v4 signature packets (Meta Hash subpacket, see discussion) was not considered.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An even later proposed fix, to store the metadata in a Signature Notation subpacket, <em>did</em> find initial support.<sup id="fnref:22" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:22" rel="footnote">22</a></sup> Since this merely extends an existing feature of OpenPGP, does not require changes to the wire format, and is therefore currently unchartered, the details were deferred to a future document.</p>

<h2 id="07-salted-signature-issue">07 Salted Signature Issue</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Salted signature were introduced with the idea that they might mitigate a chosen prefix attack in the same way as they will do for a certain SHA-1 based Web-of-Trust attack.
No research for that statement has been cited just an assumption and a concern related to fault attacks on EdDSA which is about the development of Wireguard-like protocol.
However, such fault attacks can be more securely detected by checking the signature after verification in the same way as the mitigation to Lenstra’s attack on RSA’s CRT.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The existence of practical prefix attacks is an assumption. The question is: is it a <em>reasonable</em> assumption? The WG felt it best to err on the side of caution.<sup id="fnref:23" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:23" rel="footnote">23</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anyway, the major concern here is that this adds another 32 octet covert channel to each message (and also blow the signature up by 64 octets)
In this case it is not an optional feature as with the padding packet.
This is a clear violation of best current practices in sensitive areas where signed mails are mandatory and encryption is not enforced (or monitored by a gateway).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Covert channels have already been discussed above.</p>

<h2 id="08-regression-from-deployed-formats-and-standard-behavior">08 Regression from Deployed Formats and Standard Behavior</h2>

<p>The section heading is overblown. The crypto-refresh draft and the LibrePGP draft are equally backward-compatible with all deployed OpenPGP artifacts other than those which have been rendered insecure by the passage of time, or experimental deployments.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In general the crypto-refresh draft tends to ignore the requirements of long term storage needs and considers online communication and software deployment pattern as the major OpenPGP usage.
Data and software life-cycle management has not been adequately taken in consideration and thus the draft regresses heavily from 30 years of PGP history.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No example of “ignoring the requirements of long term storage needs” has been given, unless this refers to the OPTIONAL<sup id="fnref:11:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup> GCM mode, which being OPTIONAL<sup id="fnref:11:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup> can be ignored by such applications.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Of the complaints explicitly raised by LibrePGP, one (GCM) is substantial. The Working Group agreed with those concerns, but balanced them with the requirements of some users for regulatory compliance. OpenPGP has precedent here, having already included Brainpool and Camellia ciphers on similar grounds. All such regulatory-driven extensions to OpenPGP have historically been marked OPTIONAL<sup id="fnref:11:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup>, and GCM is no different. OpenPGP crypto-refresh has conformed to established precedent here.</p>

<p>The strongest implicit complaint is that several implementations have already spent significant time developing support for v5 (LibrePGP) artifacts, and that support for v6 (crypto-refresh) would be burdensome. But it is worth pointing out that other implementations with working v5 code are also implementing v6 despite the extra workload incurred.<sup id="fnref:24" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:24" rel="footnote">24</a></sup></p>

<p>The other explicitly-stated complaints can be divided into two classes, neither of which holds up to scrutiny. Most of them are minor technical issues that have been blown out of proportion, e.g. the superficial change in the curve specifier format. Some have even been described, on the record, as acceptable compromises by Werner in previous discussions.<sup id="fnref:25" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:25" rel="footnote">25</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:26" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:26" rel="footnote">26</a></sup> It would appear therefore that these concerns have been included purely to bulk out the list of grievances.</p>

<p>The remaining explicit complaints (touched upon in the preamble) concern IETF procedure, in which case there is a route of appeal via the IETF itself.<sup id="fnref:27" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:27" rel="footnote">27</a></sup> It is not apparent that such an appeal has even been submitted, let alone ruled upon.</p>

<p>There is also one implicit complaint that is only hinted upon in the text, and that is the increasing breakdown in personal trust between Werner and the wider OpenPGP community.<sup id="fnref:28" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:28" rel="footnote">28</a></sup></p>

<p>It is obvious that LibrePGP is an attempt to create facts on the ground that prejudice the conclusion of the IETF standardisation process, in order to maintain the pre-eminent position of one OpenPGP implementation (GnuPG) at the expense of others. It is also impossible to avoid concluding that the target of this power play is the rival implementation that is currently led by two ex-employees of Werner, with whom he has a long-standing and well-documented personal conflict.<sup id="fnref:29" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:29" rel="footnote">29</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:30" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:30" rel="footnote">30</a></sup></p>

<p>Normally, personal conflicts are best left to be resolved at a personal level, but not when they fester to the point where they threaten to destroy an entire community. The root cause of this is not technical but personal, and the solution is therefore not technical but personal.</p>

<h2 id="a-way-forward">A way forward</h2>

<p>One important fact that every single person working in OpenPGP agrees upon is that OpenPGP is in a precarious position. Disagreements over governance and personal animosity have left it to stagnate, even as privacy and security technologies in general have advanced. Without fundamental changes in how OpenPGP functions as a community of human beings, it faces another lost decade at best, if not outright collapse. Actions that deliberately or carelessly foster further division are <em>not constructive</em>. We all have a responsibility to conduct ourselves in a professional manner for the sake of the community that some of us still believe in, even if it does not look particularly inspiring right now.</p>

<p>At this point in time, the OpenPGP community desperately needs to see some acts of good faith.
We strongly suggest that these should include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The librepgp.org website shall be shut down. The draft-koch-librepgp I-D<sup id="fnref:3:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> shall remain active as a reference.</li>
  <li>The OpenPGP Working Group shall, in accordance with its draft charter, begin the process of adopting the WKD protocol as described in draft-koch-openpgp-webkey-service<sup id="fnref:16:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup> as a WG standards track document, engaging in good faith with its author at all times.</li>
  <li>GnuPG shall merge <a href="https://dev.gnupg.org/T4393">https://dev.gnupg.org/T4393</a>, and desist from vetoing constructive contributions for personal reasons.</li>
  <li>The OpenPGP WG shall, as a matter of good faith, endeavour for the duration of its new charter to maintain in its work queue at all times at least one of the unchartered items already implemented in v5,<sup id="fnref:6:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> with reference to existing v5 implementations, to the extent that security and practicality concerns permit.</li>
</ul>

<p>If these things should happen, in whatever order but preferably the order listed, we can then begin the process of discussing the medium-term future of OpenPGP in a professional manner. This SHOULD include a commitment by all implementations to at minimum consume both v5 and v6 artifacts on a best-effort basis, even if they have a preference for which standard to ahdere to when generating artifacts. This should be sufficient to ensure that end users are not adversely affected by ongoing disagreements between implementations on the long term path forward.</p>

<li aria-level="1"><span>Our <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MessengerEnd-to-EndEncryptionOverview_12-6-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Messenger end-to-end encryption whitepaper </a>describes the core cryptographic protocol for transmitting messages between clients.</span></li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Today, we’re announcing that we’ve begun to upgrade people’s personal conversations on Messenger to use E2EE by default. Our aim is to ensure that everyone’s personal messages on Messenger can only be accessed by the sender and the intended recipients, and that everyone can be sure the messages they receive are from an authentic sender.</span></p>
<p><span>This is the most significant milestone yet for this project, which began in earnest after </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/2420600258234172/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Mark Zuckerberg outlined his vision for it in 2019</span></a><span>. Bringing E2EE to Messenger has been a complex process, with every feature and product goal revealing further challenges that required careful consideration.</span></p>
<p><span>Enabling E2EE on Messenger meant fundamentally rebuilding many aspects of the application its protocols to improve privacy, security, and safety while simultaneously maintaining the features that have made Messenger so popular.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Why we’re bringing E2EE to Messenger</span></h2>
<p><span>Messenger first</span> <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2016/07/messenger-starts-testing-end-to-end-encryption-with-secret-conversations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>built end-to-end encrypted chats in 2016 </span></a><span>as a feature called Secret Conversations. Since then, we’ve learned a great deal in regards to rolling out E2EE for a wider user base. For example, we recently published an updated</span> <span>white paper, “</span><a href="https://messengernews.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Metas-approach-to-safer-private-messaging-on-Messenger-and-Instagram-DMs-Sep-23.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta’s Approach to Safer Private Messaging on Messenger and Instagram Direct Messaging</a>,” t<span>hat sets out the industry-leading safety systems and tools available on Messenger.</span></p>
<p><span>End-to-end encryption isn’t about the technology at its core. It’s about protecting people’s communications, so they can feel safe expressing themselves with their friends and loved ones. To&nbsp; achieve this, we typically focus on two aims:</span></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Only the sender and recipients of an E2EE message can see its contents.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Nobody (not even Meta) should be able to forge messages to appear to have been sent from someone they weren’t.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>In other words, the aim is that only you and the people you’re corresponding with can read your messages – not even the app’s provider (in this case, Meta) could interfere with their contents – and you can be confident in who sent the messages.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Understanding these goals</span></h2>
<p><span>These two aims are broad. However, when we reflect on our approach to addressing them, they end up breaking down into eight overlapping concepts that we believe achieve a cohesive approach to meaningful E2EE:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>1. Confidentiality in transit</span></h3>
<p><span>Message contents are authentically and securely transmitted between your devices and those of the people you’re talking to. This is, perhaps, the primary goal of E2EE, and is where much E2EE research and design work is targeted, such as the Signal protocol we use in our products (such as WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram Direct), or the </span><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9420/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>IETF’s Messaging Layer Security protocol</span></a><span>, which we helped to design and was recently standardized.</span></p>
<h3><span>2. Confidentiality in storage</span></h3>
<p><span>Typically, E2EE messaging services rely on local storage and encryption keys to secure encrypted messages. Messenger, however, has a long history of storing people’s messages for them so that they can access them whenever they need without having to store them locally. That’s why we’ve designed a server-based solution where encrypted messages can be stored on Meta’s servers while only being readable using encryption keys under the user’s control.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>3. Control over endpoints</span></h3>
<p><span>For something to be “end-to-end encrypted,” it is necessary to have a notion of what the “ends” are. For an E2EE messaging app this means that users should have the ability to verify and manage their set of endpoint devices that are receiving their messages, as well as visibility into when this set of devices changes.</span></p>
<h3><span>4. Private feature designs</span></h3>
<p><span>Product features in an E2EE setting typically need to be designed to function in a device-to-device manner, without ever relying on a third party having access to message content. This </span><a href="https://messengernews.fb.com/2023/08/22/expanding-testing-for-end-to-end-encryption-on-messenger/"><span>was a significant effort for Messenger</span></a><span>, as much of its functionality has historically relied on server-side processing, with certain features difficult or impossible to exactly match with message content being limited to the devices.</span></p>
<h3><span>5. Logging limitations</span></h3>
<p><span>Maintaining the confidentiality of message content extends to avoiding accidentally leaking it back to us in telemetry. In a product of Messenger’s scale, complexity, and iteration speed, this creates particular challenges&nbsp;as telemetry is vital in ensuring that the product is working well for people, and in debugging when things go wrong.</span></p>
<h3><span>6. Application security</span></h3>
<p><span>It’s a common saying that, “You can’t have privacy without security,” and this is absolutely true in the end-to-end encrypted domain. Security is important for any consumer product, but E2EE exacerbates the challenges in two important ways: it reduces the provider’s ability to protect the user from attacks, and, in fact, it expands the threat model to include the service provider itself. Our security team is keenly aware of these challenges and works closely with product teams to secure design and implementation of E2EE functionality. For example, we’ve been working to improve the memory safety of our apps; and our E2EE surfaces are covered by our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/whitehat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bug bounty program</a>.</span></p>
<h3><span>7. Being deliberate about what’s being protected</span></h3>
<p><span>E2EE protects message content. However, this is a complex term to define, and, while certain things are relatively clear – such as the strings contained in a text message, or a photograph sent from your camera roll – in a sufficiently complex messaging application, it turns out there’s a surprisingly large grey area.&nbsp; Our focus is on determining the appropriate boundaries, ensuring that we remain true to our commitments, setting the correct user expectations, and avoiding creating meaningful privacy risks, while still ensuring that the product retains its usefulness to our users.</span></p>
<h3><span>8. Third-party scrutiny</span></h3>
<p><span>E2EE implies confidentiality even if the provider wants to access the contents of a communication. We aim for this to be verifiable externally, and, to this end, have published two white papers to provide transparency into our operations. We describe the properties of some features in our Help Center, and we encourage submissions to our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/whitehat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bug bounty program</a>. Throughout the project, we have consulted with a diverse range of external parties to ensure that we’re making the right set of tradeoffs. To improve people’s ability to scrutinize us, we also support </span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2022/03/10/security/code-verify/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>the Code Verify browser extension</span></a><span> for our web-based end-to-end encrypted messaging, to give security researchers greater confidence that the code version that they are assessing is being used globally.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>High-level approach</span></h2>
<p><span>With all of this in mind, our high-level approach was to build off of Meta’s prior learnings in E2EE, from both <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/09/10/security/whatsapp-e2ee-backups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WhatsApp</a> and Messenger’s Secret Conversations, and then to iterate on our most challenging problems.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Working from the baseline of these two approaches, we then had to address a series of significant technical challenges, including:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><strong>Multi-device capability</strong>: Messenger’s model of multi-device reflects the Facebook network, which allows people to authenticate on new devices with a username and password, in order to send and receive messages. Since <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/07/14/security/whatsapp-multi-device/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WhatsApp’s multi-device capability</a> relies on a single primary device that must cryptographically authenticate companion devices, we adopted the Secret Conversations model of multi-device, while ensuring that it functions well for all of our users.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Feature support</strong>: Messenger has a number of messaging features that either don’t exist in WhatsApp, or function differently. Some of these just had to be rebuilt from scratch, while others required deploying new applied privacy technology. For example, we used </span><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/ohai/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>OHAI</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2022/03/30/security/de-identified-authentication-at-scale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Anonymous Credentials</span></a><span> to support searches of Facebook’s first-party sticker library, without revealing to us who is sending them.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Message history</strong>: Messenger has always allowed clients to operate off of a small stored local cache, relying on a server-side database for their message history. Neither WhatsApp nor Secret Conversations operated in this manner, and we didn’t want all users to have to rely on a device-side storage system. Instead, we designed an entirely new encrypted storage system called <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TheLabyrinthEncryptedMessageStorageProtocol_12-6-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Labyrinth</a>, with ciphertexts uploaded to our servers and loaded on-demand by clients, while operating in a multi-device manner and supporting key rotation when clients are removed.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Web support</strong>: We needed to support E2EE within our existing web surfaces, including the main Facebook site. The Web platform carries significantly different constraints from native apps, meaning that we needed to take custom approaches to many different aspects of the product. Further, Web users often add and remove devices in very different patterns from mobile-only users, increasing the complexity of our multi-device challenge.</span></li>
</ol>

<p><span>The journey to bring E2EE to Messenger has been a long one, but it’s not yet finished. While we are globally launching default E2EE for personal one-to-one messages on Messenger, we are still in the testing phase for group messaging and some other products, like Instagram Direct Messages. On Instagram, we are currently testing “disappearing messages” for one-to-one Instagram Direct conversations in select countries. Disappearing messages are ephemeral and, as with those in Messenger, expire 24 hours after being sent. They are built leveraging our E2EE infrastructure and provide an increased level of privacy. We plan to expand this work as well as conduct additional testing around E2EE on Instagram over the next year.</span></p>

(Image source: various - edited)"></picture></a><figcaption>Linux has taken the gaming performance crown from Windows in a recent test. (Image source: various - edited)</figcaption></figure><div><p>Recent testing revealed that Arch Linux, Pop!_OS, and even Nobara Linux, which is maintained by a single developer, all outstripped Windows for the performance crown on Windows-native games. The testing was run at the high-end of quality settings, and Valve's Proton was used to run Windows games on Linux. </p></div></div><div id="c10575186">
<p>Since Valve's Proton compatibility layer came about, there has been a lot of discussion about the performance implications of running games with a go-between. While Linux users have long espoused the performance benefits of Linux over Windows, Proton introduces some overhead, which could result in performance degradation in games. </p>
<p>As it turns out, according to testing by <a href="https://www.computerbase.de/2023-12/welche-linux-distribution-zum-spielen/2/" target="_blank">German outlet ComputerBase</a>, the opposite may be true, or it at least appears to be true that Windows has more going on in the background that does hinder performance. The outlet tested three different Linux distributions — Arch Linux, the base of SteamOS, Nobara Linux, a fork of Fedora, and <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lemur-Pro-System76-refreshes-Linux-laptop-with-Intel-Raptor-Lake-U-series-processors.719285.0.html" target="_blank">Pop!_OS by System76</a> — across five Windows games and found that in most scenarios, Linux beats out Windows. </p>
<p>When it comes to FPS, the overall leader in testing was Nobara Linux, with Arch Linux and Pop!_OS trailing by 1–5%. <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Windows-11-steals-users-as-Steam-Deck-dominates-Linux-gaming-in-November-Steam-survey.777099.0.html" target="_self">Windows 11</a>, however, was only 6% behind Nobara Linux. So, there isn't a massive performance delta here, but it's an important milestone for Linux to be consistently ahead of Windows — especially in games designed to run on Windows. </p>
<p>In case you haven't heard of <a href="https://start.nobaraproject.org/" target="_blank">Nobara Linux</a>, it's a Fedora-based Linux distribution maintained by <a href="https://github.com/GloriousEggroll" target="_blank">GloriousEggroll</a> (Thomas Crider) — a Red Hat Software Engineer who is also responsible for ProtonGE, a modified version of Steam's Proton that often includes performance fixes and features not found in Valve's standard Proton. The point of Nobara is to deliver an easy-to-use Fedora that has been modified for gaming, so it makes sense that it scores well in gaming applications.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Of the games tested — <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i>, <i>Forspoken</i>, <i>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</i>, <i>Starfield</i>, and <i>The Talos Principle II</i> — Windows lost by the biggest margin in The Talos Principle II, where it scored just 65.1 FPS, compared to the leader, Nobara Linux, and its 71.5 FPS.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The impressive FPS deltas aside, it should be mentioned that, with the exception of Arch Linux, average frame times (measured as 1% lows, in this case) on Linux were generally behind what Windows managed by up to 20%, although frame times were all over the place, so the average may need to be taken with a grain of salt.&nbsp; </p>
<p><i><i></i></i>Curiously, <i>The Talos Principle II</i> is where Windows excelled the most in terms of 1% lows, scoring a whole 14% better than the nearest competition, Pop!_OS. The only Linux distribution to consistently challenge Windows 11 when it comes to frame times is Arch Linux, which beat Microsoft's OS in <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i>, <i>Forspoken</i>, and <i>Starfield</i>. </p>
<p>Arch Linux's success in both FPS — where it scored within 3% of the fastest system in this round of testing — and frame times may give some insight into why Valve switched from Debian to Arch Linux for the base of its SteamOS for the Steam Deck (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Valve-Handheld-Console-No-Operating-System/dp/B0BBQRYN9M?tag=nbcnewsnet-20" rel="sponsored" target="_blank">curr.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://stackdiary.com/23andme-updates-tos-to-force-binding-arbitration/">https://stackdiary.com/23andme-updates-tos-to-force-binding-arbitration/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38551890">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					
<p>23andMe, the personal genomics and biotechnology company, has been trying to contain a security breach that was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-06/hacker-puts-23andme-user-data-up-for-sale-on-the-internet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first disclosed on October 6th</a>. On <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/19/23923861/23andme-possible-data-leak-hack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 19th</a>, 23andMe disclosed <em>another</em> security breach by the same hacker who had initially claimed responsibility. The hacker said he had access to more than 4 million genetic profile records this time. And on December 4th, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23988050/23andme-hackers-accessed-user-data-confirmed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">23andMe confirmed</a> that the total scope of the breach was 6.9 million users in total.</p>



<p>The fallout of this disclosure, which started in October, was swift. By October 14th, several individuals had already filed lawsuits against 23andMe for negligence, as <a href="https://stackdiary.com/23andme-sued-by-users-over-data-breach/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Stack Diary</em> reported</a>. Likewise, the general consensus of 23andMe users has been that the company handled the situation very poorly.</p>



<p>To add insult to injury, <em>Stack Diary</em> can reveal that 23andMe is now rolling out an update to its <a href="https://www.23andme.com/en-int/legal/terms-of-service/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terms of Service</a>. This change will force its users into <em>binding arbitration</em>, which is a means to resolve disputes (such as a cybersecurity breach leaking your DNA data) outside of court.</p>



<p>In this process, both parties in a disagreement present their cases to an arbitrator, who is a neutral third party. The arbitrator listens to both sides, reviews the evidence, and decides. The key aspect of binding arbitration is that the arbitrator's decision is final and legally enforceable, meaning both parties must accept it and cannot appeal to a regular court. </p>



<p>This method is commonly used in various settings, including consumer contracts, employment disputes, and business disagreements, as it is often faster and less formal than going to court.</p>



<p>And 23andMe is trying to accomplish exactly this.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Initial Dispute Resolution Period</strong>: If you have a problem with 23andMe's services, you first need to contact their customer care team. This is to try and solve the issue quickly and without legal proceedings. You have to try this informal negotiation for at least 60 days before you can take any further legal action. You need to provide them with a detailed email outlining your issue, including what the dispute is about, when it happened, what you want as a solution, and your contact details. You (and your lawyer, if you have one) will also need to have a discussion with them to try and solve the dispute.</li>



<li><strong>Arbitration Instead of Court</strong>: If the issue isn't resolved in those 60 days, the next step is usually not a lawsuit in court, but arbitration. This means a neutral third party (an arbitrator) will listen to both sides and make a decision. The rules of this process are governed by JAMS, a company that provides arbitration services. In some cases, if many people have similar disputes against 23andMe, a different process called Mass Arbitration with another company, NAM, will be used.</li>



<li><strong>Arbitrator's Decision</strong>: The arbitrator’s decision is final. They have to follow the law and can give any ruling that a court could.</li>



<li><strong>Exceptions to Arbitration</strong>: There are a few situations where you or 23andMe can take the issue to court instead of arbitration. This includes things like intellectual property disputes and small claims (minor issues).</li>



<li><strong>No Class Actions</strong>: You can't join with other people to bring a class action or collective arbitration against 23andMe. Each dispute is handled individually.</li>



<li><strong>Severability</strong>: If any part of this dispute resolution section is not legally enforceable, the rest still applies.</li>
</ul>



<p>In the event of a cybersecurity breach, this means that if you have a dispute with 23andMe about it, you would first try to resolve it with their customer care. If that doesn't work, you'd generally go to arbitration, not a lawsuit, unless it falls under one of the exceptions. You also can't join a class action lawsuit for such an issue.</p>



<h2>23andMe is beginning to notify its users</h2>



<p>23andMe is beginning to inform its users of a modification in their Terms of Service via email. Users are given a 30-day window from when they receive this email to opt out of these new, stringent terms that significantly reduce their rights. </p>

<p>The email doesn't mention that you must email the "<a href="mailto:arbitrationoptout@23andme.com">arbitrationoptout@23andme.com</a>" address to opt out of forced arbitration, as outlined in the updated Terms of Service, which you can <a href="https://www.23andme.com/legal/terms-of-service/#dispute-resolution-arbitration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preview here</a>. </p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>30 Day Right to Opt-Out</strong>. You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out by emailing us at arbitrationoptout@23andme.com. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Service, or the effective date of the first set of Terms containing an Arbitration and Class Action and Class Arbitration Waiver section otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those sections. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It's <em>unlikely</em> that the intention of the email mix-up is malicious in nature; they would absolutely get destroyed by every privacy organization on the planet if they snuck in a change like that, but I have emailed them to verify the above and will add a response here once I get it.</p>



<p>That said, unless you email this account 30 days after starting to use the service for the first time, you will automatically be enrolled in this arbitration scheme. Likewise, this affects all users who were affected by the cybersecurity breach since the terms were changed after the fact. Because these terms were put in place on November 30, 2023 - it has already been over a week, and most users might not understand why this is important or relevant.</p>



<p>If you're unsure as to why arbitration is bad, it's because it is biased against the consumer. The Stanford Graduate School of Business did an entire study on it; you can read the blog post about it <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/why-binding-arbitration-game-rigged-against-customers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a> or view the entire study <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/working-papers/arbitration-uninformed-consumers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>. </p>



<p>Here's an excerpt from the blog post:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Now, a&nbsp;new analysis&nbsp;of almost 9,000 arbitration cases from the securities industry confirms what many have long suspected: The system is biased against consumers — and not just because big companies have more money to spend on lawyers.</p>



<p>When it comes to arbitration, the study finds, companies have a big information advantage in fishing for arbitrators who are likely to rule in their favor.</p>



<p>Making matters worse, the arbitrators themselves know that being pro-company in one case greatly increases their chances of being picked for future cases.</p>
<cite>Edmund L. Andrews, Stanford Business</cite></blockquote>



<p>This is merely about 23andMe protecting <em>itself</em> (not you, the consumer) because if a security breach of this scope happens again in the future, it will have <em>some</em> protection against mass user complaints.</p>



<h2>How to opt-out (email template)</h2>



<p>If you have been affected by the security breach at 23andMe and would like to opt out of the forced arbitration, here is an email template that you can use:</p>



<div>
<p><strong>To:</strong> <a href="mailto:legal@23andme.com">legal@23andme.com</a>, <a href="mailto:customercare@23andme.com">customercare@23andme.com</a>, <a href="mailto:arbitrationoptout@23andme.com">arbitrationoptout@23andme.com</a><br><strong>Subject:</strong> Request to Opt-Out of Updated TOS</p>



<p>Dear 23andMe Team,</p>



<p>I am contacting you regarding the recent changes to the 23andMe Terms of Service, dated November 30, 2023. My name is [your name as registered with 23andMe], and the email associated with my 23andMe account is [your 23andMe account email].</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Researchers led by the University of Cambridge used a technique known as diamond quantum sensing to observe swirling textures and faint magnetic signals on the surface of hematite, a type of iron oxide.</p>

<p>The researchers observed that magnetic monopoles in hematite emerge through the collective behaviour of many spins (the angular momentum of a particle). These monopoles glide across the swirling textures on the surface of the hematite, like tiny hockey pucks of magnetic charge. This is the first time that naturally occurring emergent monopoles have been observed experimentally.</p>

<p>The research has also shown the direct connection between the previously hidden swirling textures and the magnetic charges of materials like hematite, as if there is a secret code linking them together. The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-023-01737-4">results</a>, which could be useful in enabling next-generation logic and memory applications, are reported in the journal <em>Nature Materials</em>.</p>

<p>According to the equations of James Clerk Maxwell, a giant of Cambridge physics, magnetic objects, whether a fridge magnet or the Earth itself, must always exist as a pair of magnetic poles that cannot be isolated.</p>

<p>“The magnets we use every day have two poles: north and south,” said Professor Mete Atatüre, who led the research. “In the 19th century, it was hypothesised that monopoles could exist. But in one of his foundational equations for the study of electromagnetism, James Clerk Maxwell disagreed.”</p>

<p>Atatüre is Head of Cambridge’s Cavendish Laboratory, a position once held by Maxwell himself. “If monopoles did exist, and we were able to isolate them, it would be like finding a missing puzzle piece that was assumed to be lost,” he said.</p>

<p>About 15 years ago, scientists suggested how monopoles could exist in a magnetic material. This theoretical result relied on the extreme separation of north and south poles so that locally each pole appeared isolated in an exotic material called spin ice.</p>

<p>However, there is an alternative strategy to find monopoles, involving the concept of emergence. The idea of emergence is the combination of many physical entities can give rise to properties that are either more than or different to the sum of their parts.</p>

<p>Working with colleagues from the University of Oxford and the National University of Singapore, the Cambridge researchers used emergence to uncover monopoles spread over two-dimensional space, gliding across the swirling textures on the surface of a magnetic material.</p>

<p>The swirling topological textures are found in two main types of materials: ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. Of the two, antiferromagnets are more stable than ferromagnets, but they are more difficult to study, as they don’t have a strong magnetic signature.</p>

<p>To study the behaviour of antiferromagnets, Atatüre and his colleagues use an imaging technique known as diamond quantum magnetometry. This technique uses a single spin – the inherent angular momentum of an electron – in a diamond needle to precisely measure the magnetic field on the surface of a material, without affecting its behaviour.</p>

<p>For the current study, the researchers used the technique to look at hematite, an antiferromagnetic iron oxide material. To their surprise, they found hidden patterns of magnetic charges within hematite, including monopoles, dipoles and quadrupoles.</p>

<p>“Monopoles had been predicted theoretically, but this is the first time we’ve actually seen a two-dimensional monopole in a naturally occurring magnet,” said co-author Professor Paolo Radaelli, from the University of Oxford.</p>

<p>“These monopoles are a collective state of many spins that twirl around a singularity rather than a single fixed particle, so they emerge through many-body interactions. The result is a tiny, localised stable particle with diverging magnetic field coming out of it,” said co-first author Dr Hariom Jani, from the University of Oxford.</p>

<p>“We’ve shown how diamond quantum magnetometry could be used to unravel the mysterious behaviour of magnetism in two-dimensional quantum materials, which could open up new fields of study in this area,” said co-first author Dr Anthony Tan, from the Cavendish Laboratory. “The challenge has always been direct imaging of these textures in antiferromagnets due to their weaker magnetic pull, but now we’re able to do so, with a nice combination of diamonds and rust.”</p>

<p>The study not only highlights the potential of diamond quantum magnetometry but also underscores its capacity to uncover and investigate hidden magnetic phenomena in quantum materials. If controlled, these swirling textures dressed in magnetic charges could power super-fast and energy-efficient computer memory logic.</p>

<p>The research was supported in part by the Royal Society, the Sir Henry Royce Institute, the European Union, and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI).</p>

<p><span>Today we announced one of our biggest breakthroughs—Sound ID, a new feature in the </span><a href="https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/"><span>Merlin Bird ID</span></a><span> app—and a major leap forward&nbsp;in sound identification and machine learning to date. Sound ID lets people use their phone to listen to the birds around them, and see live predictions of who’s singing. Currently, Merlin can identify 458 bird species in the U.S. and Canada based on their sounds (with more species and regions coming soon). Sound ID runs on your device, without requiring a network connection. <a href="https://merlinbirdid.page.link/sound-id">Download it today for free</a>&nbsp;and test it out in your own backyard! If you happen to be located in the Northeastern United States you can test out Sound ID on the audio below which was recorded in New Hampshire.</span></p>
<h2><b>How does Sound ID work?</b></h2>
<p><span>As your phone records sound, Merlin converts the audio into an image called a spectrogram. The spectrogram plots sound frequencies that appear in the recording, as a function of time. This spectrogram image is then fed into a modern computer vision model called a deep convolutional neural network. We trained this model to identify birds based on 140 hours of audio containing bird sounds, in addition to 126 hours of audio containing non-bird background sounds, like whistling and car noises. For each audio clip, a group of sound ID experts from the Macaulay Library and the eBird community found the precise moments when birds were making sounds, and tagged those sounds with the corresponding bird species. The model can use this detailed supervision from experts to learn how to correctly predict the species that appear in these annotated audio clips, with the goal of generalizing this knowledge to predict which birds appear in audio recordings it hasn’t heard before.</span></p>



<p><span>So how does it work? Once the database of sounds is assembled, we train the computer vision model using a gradient descent algorithm. When the model “hears” a sound clip, it makes a prediction that is based on the transformation of the sound clip’s spectrogram through a series of mathematical operations involving millions of numbers (called <em>weights</em>). The gradient descent algorithm figures out how to adjust the value of each weight to ensure that the model’s predictions match those of the sound ID experts. This weight updating process is the “learning” part of machine learning. </span></p>
<p><span>Building the sound ID model is an iterative process, involving a back-and-forth between the sound ID experts, members of the machine learning team, and people who provide feedback based on field tests of the app. After evaluating a trained model’s performance, we make adjustments to the training algorithm, ask the sound ID experts to label more audio clips, and try to locate any human errors in the previously labeled data.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>What’s special about Sound ID in Merlin?</b></h2>
<p><span>Merlin is not the first to use deep convolutional neural networks to identify birds by their sounds. In fact, Merlin draws inspiration from a number of other projects, including </span><a href="https://birdnet.cornell.edu/"><span>BirdNET</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/birdvox/"><span>BirdVox</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There have been many other approaches to bird sound ID through the years, the result of engineering contests such as </span><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/birdclef-2021"><span>BirdClef</span></a><span> and </span><a href="http://dcase.community/challenge2021/task-few-shot-bioacoustic-event-detection"><span>DCASE</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/rfcx-species-audio-detection"><span>among</span></a> <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/birdsong-recognition"><span>many</span></a> <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13103"><span>others</span></a><span>. </span><span>Similar techniques have been used to </span><a href="https://naturesmartcities.com/"><span>monitor the activity of bats</span></a><span>, as well as find </span><a href="https://www.blog.google/technology/ai/pattern-radio-whale-songs/"><span>patterns in whale songs</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Previous bird sound ID models have typically been trained using data with a coarser level of temporal resolution. For instance, a model might hear a 30 second recording of a White-breasted Nuthatch, but not be told when the nuthatch is singing in the recording. This can lead to problems: if other species are singing in the same recording, the model will erroneously call all species in the recording a White-breasted Nuthatch, leading to false predictions.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Merlin’s Sound ID tool is trained using audio data which includes the precise moments in time when each bird is vocalizing. The process of generating this data is labor intensive, because it requires sound ID experts to listen to each audio file carefully. As a result of these efforts, the model has the opportunity to learn a more accurate representation of which sounds correspond to which species (and which sounds are ambient noises). </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.07031"><span>Recent research</span></a><span> confirms that temporally fine-grained labels can help improve audio classification performance.</span></p>

<p><span>In building the model, we made a number of design decisions about how to handle our particular dataset, how to integrate predictions with information from eBird</span><span> (a database of bird sightings shared by citizen scientists from around the world),</span><span> and how to maximize the accuracy of Merlin Sound ID’s predictions in the field.</span></p>
<p><span>In the coming weeks, we’ll be posting a series of articles that take a closer look at these design decisions. We’ll also explore some of what’s in store for our Sound ID tools in the future.</span></p>
<p><span>If you’ve tried Sound ID in Merlin, we’d love to hear about your experience. You can get in touch on Twitter, where the Macaulay Library is <a href="https://twitter.com/macaulaylibrary?lang=en">@MacaulayLibrary</a>.</span></p>

		<p>Since the dawn of <a href="https://twitter.com/lunasorcery/status/1576008439586648065">October 1st 2022</a>, the world has been plagued by the question:</p>
<p><strong><em>Would accelerated backhopping give you a competitive advantage in the 100m dash?</em></strong></p>
<p>In this <s>deranged ramble</s> blog article we shall attempt to answer the question once and for all.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
“Gordon! You must get out of here! Run!”
<cite>— Dr. Kleiner, Half-Life 2</cite>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2 id="initial-parameters">Initial Parameters</h2>
<p>Our investigation into the viability of accelerated backhopping as a competitive strategy in the 100m dash will use the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Movement physics will be as present in Half-Life 2.</li>
<li>The 100m dash will be as defined in the IAAF Competition Rules.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-is-accelerated-backhopping">What is Accelerated Backhopping?</h2>
<p><em>Note: the technical aspects of this section are largely adapted from <a href="https://wiki.sourceruns.org/wiki/Accelerated_Back_Hopping">the SourceRuns wiki</a>.</em></p>
<p>Accelerated backhopping (henceforth referred to as ABH) is a bug in the Source engine movement code, allowing the player to move far faster than the developers intended.</p>
<p>When the player performs a jump, the game tries to give the player a little extra speed boost, based on their current velocity, state (crouching, sprinting, etc), movement input, and look direction. It also attempts to cap the player’s speed, but an oversight in the programming causes the player to accelerate far beyond that speed limit under certain circumstances.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let’s look at <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/blob/56accfdb9c4abd32ae1dc26b2e4cc87898cf4dc1/sp/src/game/shared/gamemovement.cpp#L2469-L2495">the code</a>; this is executed when a player is on the ground and makes a jump input:</p>
<p>Calculate the boost multiplier <code>flSpeedBoostPerc</code> to determine how much of a boost we want to give. If the player is sprinting or ducking, they get a 10% boost, otherwise they get a 50% boost.</p>
<pre><code>float flSpeedBoostPerc = ( !pMoveData-&gt;m_bIsSprinting &amp;&amp; !player-&gt;m_Local.m_bDucked ) ? 0.5f : 0.1f;
</code></pre>
<p>Calculate <code>flSpeedAddition</code>, the additional velocity we want to apply to our player’s speed, by scaling the player’s forward movement input <code>mv-&gt;m_flForwardMove</code> by our boost multiplier, and taking the absolute value so it’s positive.</p>
<pre><code>float flSpeedAddition = fabs( mv-&gt;m_flForwardMove * flSpeedBoostPerc );
</code></pre>
<p>Calculate <code>flMaxSpeed</code>, the maximum speed the player should be travelling at. We take <code>mv-&gt;m_flMaxSpeed</code>, the maximum speed expected for the player’s current state, and increase it by our boost multiplier.</p>
<pre><code>float flMaxSpeed = mv-&gt;m_flMaxSpeed + ( mv-&gt;m_flMaxSpeed * flSpeedBoostPerc );
</code></pre>
<p>Calculate <code>flNewSpeed</code>, the speed we expect the player to have after jumping, by adding <code>flSpeedAddition</code> to the player’s current lateral velocity <code>mv-&gt;m_vecVelocity.Length2D</code>.</p>
<pre><code>float flNewSpeed = ( flSpeedAddition + mv-&gt;m_vecVelocity.Length2D() );
</code></pre>
<p>If the player’s new speed is higher than the maximum speed, subtract the difference from <code>flSpeedAddition</code>.</p>
<pre><code>if ( flNewSpeed &gt; flMaxSpeed )
{
    flSpeedAddition -= flNewSpeed - flMaxSpeed;
}
</code></pre>
<p>If the player is providing a backwards movement input, negate <code>flSpeedAddition</code>:</p>
<pre><code>if ( mv-&gt;m_flForwardMove &lt; 0.0f )
    flSpeedAddition *= -1.0f;
</code></pre>
<p>Apply the speed addition to the player’s velocity, by adding it in the forward look direction <code>vecForward</code>:</p>
<pre><code>VectorAdd( (vecForward*flSpeedAddition), mv-&gt;m_vecVelocity, mv-&gt;m_vecVelocity );
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>The critical flaw in the code resides in the assumption that the movement input and the current velocity are correlated.</p>
<p>Consider the following situation: The player is sprinting along at 320ups (units per second). They jump forwards, and the boost increases their speed to 352ups, by design. While in the air, they spin around 180 degrees (so they’re now facing where they came from, and moving backwards), release all movement inputs, and begin crouching. Upon touching the ground, still moving at 352ups, they immediately jump again.</p>
<p>The player is crouching, so the boost multiplier is set to 10%.</p>
<p>Since the player isn’t providing any forward movement input, <code>flSpeedAddition</code> becomes 0:</p>
<pre><code>float flSpeedAddition = fabs( mv-&gt;m_flForwardMove * flSpeedBoostPerc ) 
                      = fabs(0 * 0.1) 
                      = 0
</code></pre>
<p>The max speed <code>flMaxSpeed</code> is calculated based on <em>crouching</em> speed limit of 190ups, and comes out as 209:</p>
<pre><code>float flMaxSpeed = mv-&gt;m_flMaxSpeed + ( mv-&gt;m_flMaxSpeed * flSpeedBoostPerc ) 
                 = 190 + (190 * 0.1) 
                 = 209
</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>flSpeedAddition</code> is 0, the new speed <code>flNewSpeed</code> does not change from the player’s current velocity.</p>
<pre><code>float flNewSpeed = ( flSpeedAddition + mv-&gt;m_vecVelocity.Length2D() ) 
                 = 0 + 352 
                 = 352
</code></pre>
<p><code>flNewSpeed</code> is now far in excess of <code>flMaxSpeed</code>, so the difference is subtracted from <code>flSpeedAddition</code>, giving -143:</p>
<pre><code>flSpeedAddition -= flNewSpeed - flMaxSpeed;
                = 0 - (352 - 209)
                = -143
</code></pre>
<p>The player is not providing any backwards movement input, so <code>flSpeedAddition</code> remains negative.</p>
<pre><code>if ( mv-&gt;m_flForwardMove &lt; 0.0f ) // false
    flSpeedAddition *= -1.0f; // doesn't execute
</code></pre>
<p>This negative value then gets multiplied by the player’s <em>forward</em> look direction, producing a vector pointing 143 units <em>behind</em> them. This gets applied to the player’s velocity vector — remember, since spinning in mid-air they’re already moving backwards — increasing their speed by 143ups for a new speed of 495ups.</p>
<p>On the next jump, this effect is compounded, creating a speed boost of 286ups, then 572ups, then 1144ups, and so on.</p>

<h2 id="rules-of-engagement">Rules of Engagement</h2>
<p>We will now consult the <a href="https://worldathletics.org/about-iaaf/documents/book-of-rules">IAAF Book of Rules</a> to determine the conditions under which we will compete. The following excerpts are all taken from IAAF Book C, C2.1 Technical Rules.</p>
<h3 id="attire">Attire</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Assistance not Allowed</p>
<p><strong>6.3</strong>   For the purpose of this Rule, the following examples shall be considered assistance, and are therefore not allowed:<br>
[...]<br>
<strong>6.3.4</strong> The use of any mechanical aid, except by an athlete with an impairment as authorised or permitted in accordance with the Mechanical Aids Regulations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wearing the HEV suit allows the player to sprint, allowing for a much faster initial ABH speed than would otherwise be possible (495ups with the suit, 285ups without). We believe it is a reasonable interpretation that the HEV suit constitutes a mechanical aid, and would therefore not be permitted for use. Our runner will thus compete without the suit.</p>
<h3 id="race-start">Race Start</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>16.3</strong>  In races up to and including 400m (including the first leg of 4 × 200m, the Medley Relay and 4 × 400m), <strong>a crouch start and the use of starting blocks are compulsory</strong>. After the “On your marks” command, an athlete shall approach the start line, assume a position completely within their allocated lane and behind the start line. An athlete shall not touch either the start line or the ground in front of it with their hands or their feet when on their mark. Both hands and at least one knee shall be in contact with the ground and both feet in contact with the foot plates of the starting blocks. At the “Set” command, an athlete shall immediately rise to their final starting position retaining the contact of the hands with the ground and of the feet with the foot plates of the blocks. Once the Starter is satisfied that all athletes are steady in the “Set” position, the gun shall be fired.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within the bounds of Half-Life 2’s movement, the use of starting blocks and placing hands on the ground are not possible, so we will assume reasonable exemption from these rules. However, we can still abide by the requirement of a crouching start.</p>
<h3 id="lanes">Lanes</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>14.4</strong>  In all races up to and including 400m, each athlete shall have a separate lane, with a width of 1.22m ± 0.01m, including the lane line on the right, marked by white lines 50mm in width. All lanes shall be of the same nominal width. The inner lane shall be measured as stated in Rule 14.2, but the remaining lanes shall be measured 0.20m from the outer edges of the lines.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- -->

<blockquote>
<p><strong>17.3</strong>  In all races:</p>
<p><strong>17.3.1</strong>    run in lanes, each athlete shall keep within their allocated lane from start to finish. This shall also apply to any portion of a race run in lanes;</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- -->

<blockquote>
<p><strong>17.4</strong>  An athlete, or in the case of a relay race, their team, shall not be disqualified if the athlete:<br>
[...]<br>
<strong>17.4.2</strong>    steps or runs outside their lane in the straight, any straight part of the diversion from the track for the steeplechase water jump or outside the outer line of their lane on the bend;<br>
[...]<br>
and no material advantage is gained and no other athlete being jostled or obstructed so as to impede the other athlete’s progress (see Rule 17.2 of the Technical Rules). If material advantage is gained, the athlete (or team) shall be disqualified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In summary, the lane is 1.22m wide, and we must be careful to stay within that lane. We are only permitted to leave the lane if no material advantage would be gained by doing so; as such we cannot use any maneuvers that depend on us leaving the lane.</p>
<h3 id="the-finish">The Finish</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>18.2</strong>  The athletes shall be placed in the order in which any part of their bodies (i.e. torso, as distinguished from the head, neck, arms, legs, hands or feet) reaches the vertical plane of the nearer edge of the finish line as defined above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In summary, our aim is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Travel 100 meters as quickly as possible,</li>
<li>from a stationary crouching start,</li>
<li>without leaving the 1.22m-wide lane,</li>
<li>and without wearing an HEV suit.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="a-matter-of-scale">A Matter of Scale</h2>
<p>Contemporary game engines typically base their unit systems on the metric system.<sup id="fnref:cite-unity-units"><a href="#fn:cite-unity-units">[1]</a></sup><sup id="fnref:cite-unreal-units"><a href="#fn:cite-unreal-units">[2]</a></sup> Source engine, however, is an unusual beast, and its units are based on the imperial system. Maps are modelled at a scale of 16 units = 1 foot, or 1 unit = 3/4 inch.<sup id="fnref:cite-source-units"><a href="#fn:cite-source-units">[3]</a></sup> From this, we can calculate that our 100m run is 5,249.34 units.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-run">The Run</h2>
<p><em>Note: The following timings and speeds are theoretical based on a crude analysis of the game code, and may not necessarily be reproducible under practical testing.</em></p>
<p>The player begins from a crouching position at the start line. Since an ABH cannot be performed from a crouching start, they spend 200ms returning to a standing position.<sup id="fnref:cite-unduck"><a href="#fn:cite-unduck">[4]</a></sup> Once standing, they begin walking forward, quickly reaching their maximum walking speed of 150ups. Once at speed, they make their first jump facing forwards. They get the <em>intended</em> jump-speed bonus, accelerating them to 225ups. While in the air, they release all forward input, turn 180 degrees, and crouch. Roughly 510ms after jumping,<sup id="fnref:cite-jumptime"><a href="#fn:cite-jumptime">[5]</a></sup> they make their first landing. Still crouching and providing no lateral movement input, they jump again, ABH accelerating them from 225ups to a new speed of 285ups. A further 510ms later, they hit the ground again, and with another jump, ABH accelerates them to 405ups. This continues as follows:</p>

<p><small>* from initial jump</small><br>

<p>On the seventh jump, ABH <em>would</em> give a velocity of 4005ups, but this gets hard-capped to 3500ups, and remains as such for the remainder of the run. 3.865s after the first jump, the player flies across the finish line, and shortly afterwards at 4.08s, they land some 753.36u (14.35m) beyond it.</p>
<p>Note that these timings and distances are relative to the first jump. After the starting pistol is fired, the player takes 200ms to stand from crouching, and an unspecified amount of time and distance (dependent on the ground friction) to reach their 150ups walking speed. However, given the acceleration the player is able to achieve once jumping, this pre-jump phase would have to last at least 5.715s in order for 100m record-holder Usain Bolt to still have a chance of outrunning them.</p>
<p>We hereby propose that the IAAF add a rule explicitly banning the use of ABH in competitions, and submit this article as justification.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="addendum">Addendum</h2>
<p>Lyren from the SourceRuns team provided two practical runs, one with human inputs [<a href="https://moonbase.lgbt/blog/100m-accelerated-backhopping/100-scriptless.mp4">video</a>], and one with <a href="https://wiki.sourceruns.org/wiki/Host_timescale">host_timescale</a> to slow down time, along with an autojumping script [<a href="https://moonbase.lgbt/blog/100m-accelerated-backhopping/100-scripted.mp4">video</a>].</p>
<p>It could be argued that since the player cannot sprint without the HEV suit, this would constitute an impairment and the suit may be permitted under the Mechanical Aids Regulations. However, as shown, even without the suit, the player clearly has an unfair advantage over conventional human runners; the addition of the suit would just add further insult to injury.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <h2> door <span property="author">Jasper Devreker</span> </h2> <p><small> Geschreven op <span property="dateCreated">2023-12-06</span><br> Leestijd: 18 minuten </small> </p> </div><div property="articleBody"> <article> <div> <p>The ESP32 is a popular microcontroller known in the maker community for its low price (~ €5) and useful features: it has a dual-core CPU, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity and 520 KB of RAM. It is also used commercially, in devices ranging from smart CO₂-meters to industrial automation controllers. Most of the software development kit that is used to program for the ESP32 <a href="https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf">is open-source</a>, except notably the wireless bits (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, low-level RF functions): that functionality is distributed as precompiled libraries, that are then compiled into the firmware the developer&nbsp;writes.</p> <p>A closed-source Wi-Fi implementation has several disadvantages compared to an open-source implementation&nbsp;though:</p> <ul> <li>You are dependent on the vendor (Espressif in this case) to add features; if you have a somewhat non-standard usecase, you might be out of luck. For example, standards-compliant mesh networking (IEEE 802.11s) is not supported on the ESP32; there is <a href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/api-guides/esp-wifi-mesh.html">a partially closed-source mesh networking implementation made by Espressif</a>, but this is rather limited: the mesh network has a tree topology, and uses NAT on the nodes connected to the root network, making it hard to connect from outside the mesh network to nodes in the mesh network. The protocol is also not documented, so it’s not interoperable with other&nbsp;devices.</li> <li>It’s hard to audit the security of the implementation: since there is no source code available, you have to resort to black-box fuzzing and reverse engineering to find security&nbsp;vulnerabilities.</li> <li>Additionally, an open-source implementation would make research into low-power Wi-Fi mesh networking more affordable; if each node only costs about €5, research involving hundreds of nodes can be affordable on a modest&nbsp;budget.</li> </ul> <p>Espressif has an open issue in their esp32-wifi-lib repository, asking to open-source the MAC layer. In that issue, they confirmed in 2016 that open sourcing the upper MAC is on their roadmap, but as of 2023, nothing has been published yet. Having the source code would for example allow us to implement proper 802.11s-compliant mesh&nbsp;networking.</p> <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2> <p>The main goal of this project is to build a minimal replacement for Espressifs proprietary Wi-Fi binary blobs. We don’t intend to be API-compatible with existing code that uses the Espressif ESP-IDF API, rather, we’d like to have a fully working, open source networking&nbsp;stack.</p> <p>The rest of this section will contain information about how the network stack and Wi-Fi (the 802.11 standard) works, so if you’re already familiar, you can skip&nbsp;it.</p> <figure> <a href="https://pics.zeus.gent/vYXyQm2t9pJCzpDdWFvq9oWR2DACoUJoTsYf8qiz.jpg"> <img src="https://pics.zeus.gent/vYXyQm2t9pJCzpDdWFvq9oWR2DACoUJoTsYf8qiz.jpg" alt="OSI model of the network stack (the difference between application/presentation/session is a bit murky)"> </a> <figcaption>OSI model of the network stack (the difference between application/presentation/session is a bit murky)</figcaption> </figure> <p>Above, you can see a diagram showing the network stack. Computer networking is done with a network stack, where every layer in the stack has its own purpose; this design makes it easier to swap out layers and allows for separate development of layers. The layer at the bottom of the stack interacts with the physical world (for example, by using radiowaves or electric signals); every layer adds their own features. Wi-Fi (also known as the 802.11 standard by engineers) is implemented in the bottom two layers: the PHY layer (what the radio waveforms look like, …) and the MAC layer (how we connect to an access point, what packets exist, how to send packets to local devices,&nbsp;…).</p> <p>On the ESP32, the PHY layer is implemented in hardware; most of the MAC layer is implemented in the proprietary blob. One notable exception to this separation is sending acknowlegement frame: if a device receives a frame, it should send a packet back to acknowledge that this packet was received correctly. This ACK packet needs to be sent within ~10 microseconds; it would be hard to get this timing correct in&nbsp;software.</p> <p>There are 3 types of MAC&nbsp;frames:</p> <ul> <li>Management frames: mostly for managing the connection between the access point and station&nbsp;(client)</li> <li>Control frames: help with delivery of other types of frames (for example ACK, but also request-to-send and&nbsp;clear-to-send)</li> <li>Data frames: contain the data of the layers above the MAC&nbsp;layer</li> </ul> <h2 id="previous-work">Previous&nbsp;work</h2> <p>Since it doesn’t look like Espressif will release an open source MAC implementation anytime soon, we’re on our own to create this. This is rather hard to do, because the hardware with which we send and receive 802.11 packets on the ESP32 is entirely undocumented. This means that we will need to reverse engineer the hardware; first we’ll need to document what the hardware does, then we’ll need to write our own code to correctly interact with it. In 2021, Uri Shaked did some very light reverse engineering of ESP32 Wi-Fi hardware, to mock this in his emulator. That way, programs for the ESP32 can be emulated instead of running them on real hardware. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmaT8bMssyQ">Shaked gave a talk about this</a>, but only discussed very high level details about the hardware. Espressif has <a href="https://github.com/espressif/qemu">their own fork of QEMU</a> (a popular, open-source emulator) that can also emulate the ESP32, but this fork does not support emulating the Wi-Fi hardware. In 2022, Martin Johnson added basic support for the Wi-Fi hardware to <a href="https://github.com/a159x36/qemu">their own fork of Espressif’s QEMU</a>. The emulated ESP32 can connect to a virtual access point, or have a virtual client connect to&nbsp;it.</p> <p>esp-idf (the SDK for the ESP32) has a function to transmit frames (<code>esp_wifi_80211_tx</code>), but this function only accepts certain types of frames; it does not allow sending most management frames, severely limiting the usefulness of this API to base an 802.11 MAC stack on. They also have a function (<code>esp_wifi_set_promiscuous_rx_cb</code>) to receive a callback on reception of a&nbsp;frame.</p>  <p>Before we can start reverse engineering how the 802.11 PHY hardware works and how we interact with it, we first need to find or build tools that will help. We’ll use 3 main&nbsp;approaches:</p> <ul> <li>Static reverse engineering: we have the compiled libraries that implement the Wi-Fi stack, so we can look at the compiled code and try to decompile it to human-readable code. From this more readable code, we then try to see what the hardware expects the software to&nbsp;do.</li> <li>Dynamic code analysis in an emulator: we can run the firmware in an emulator and inspect how it interacts with the virtual hardware. This has the advantage of having a lot of freedom to how we inspect the hardware, but the disadvantage that the emulator might not behave the same as real hardware. Since we’ll need to write the emulated peripherals ourselves, this risk is real: there is no public datasheet for the Wi-Fi peripheral, so we have to guess how the hardware will behave from the code that interacts with&nbsp;it.</li> <li>Dynamic code analysis on real hardware: we can run the firmware on an actual ESP32, and debug it using a JTAG debugger. This allows us to place breakpoints, inspect the memory and registers, stop and resume the execution, … The disadvantage is that the debugging capabilities are more limited compared to running in an emulator: we can only place 2 breakpoints, we cannot place watchpoints (breakpoints that trigger on memory reads/writes to a certain address), … The big advantage compared to using an emulator is that we’ll know for sure that the behaviour of the hardware is&nbsp;correct.</li> </ul> <h3 id="static-analysis">Static&nbsp;analysis</h3> <p>For the static analysis, we use Ghidra, an open-source reverse engineering tool made by the NSA. Out of the box, Ghidra does not have support <a href="https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/pull/5442">yet</a> for Xtensa (the CPU architecture of the ESP32), but there is a <a href="https://github.com/Ebiroll/ghidra-xtensa">plugin that adds support</a>. The build tools used in the ESP32 SDK generate both an ELF file (a type of binary file that can contain metadata) and a flat binary file: using the ELF file has the benefit of automatically setting most function&nbsp;names.</p> <h3 id="dynamic-analysis-in-emulator">Dynamic analysis in&nbsp;emulator</h3> <p>We started off from Martin Johnsons’s fork of Espressifs version of QEMU (a popular open-source emulator), and ported their changes to the latest version of Espressif’s QEMU fork. The ESP32 talks to its peripherals via memory mapped IO: by reading from and writing to certain memory addresses, the peripherals provides information to the CPU and does things. To help in reverse engineering, we added log statements to the QEMU Wi-Fi peripherals that log every access to their memory&nbsp;ranges.</p> <p>Additionally, we also implemented stack unwinding in QEMU; this is done for every memory access to a hardware peripheral related to Wi-Fi. That way, we can get a full stack trace for every peripheral access. Symbols are not stripped, so this is a very useful tool. However, to get stack unwinding properly working, we have to run QEMU in single step mode: QEMU has a JIT compiler that compiles sequences of emulated assembly instructions into optimized basic blocks. This greatly improves the execution speed, but since the CPU execution state is only guaranteed to be correct at the beginning of a basic block, if a peripheral memory access happens in the middle of such a basic block, the stack unwinding algorithm gives wrong&nbsp;results.</p> <p>Running in single-step mode negates much of the benefit of the QEMU JIT compiler, causing the code to run much slower. This is not that big of a disadvantage, compared to the treasure trove of information the execution trace gives&nbsp;us.</p> <p>Below is an example of a single memory access logged by QEMU: it’s a write (<code>W</code>) to address <code>3ff46094</code> with value <code>00010005</code>, done by the function <code>ram_pbus_force_test</code>. The rest of the callstack is also logged, and translated to a symbol name if&nbsp;available.</p> <p><code> W 3ff46094 00010005 ram_pbus_force_test 400044f4 set_rx_gain_cal_dc set_rx_gain_testchip_70 set_rx_gain_table bb_init register_chipv7_phy esp_phy_load_cal_and_init esp_phy_enable wifi_hw_start wifi_start_process ieee80211_ioctl_process ppTask vPortTaskWrapper </code></p> <p>Finally, we also corrected the handling of MAC addresses (compared to Martin Johnsons version), so that a packet capture has correct MAC addresses in packets instead of hardcoded&nbsp;addresses.</p> <h3 id="dynamic-analysis-on-real-hardware">Dynamic analysis on real&nbsp;hardware</h3> <p>To dynamically analyze the firmware on real hardware, we use the JTAG hardware debugging interface. By connecting some jumper wires between the ESP32 and a JTAG debugger, we can debug the ESP32. We followed the steps described in <a href="https://github.com/amirgon/ESP32-JTAG">this GitHub repository</a> to get our JTAG debugger (CJMCU-232H)&nbsp;working.</p> <p>In additon to the JTAG debugger, we also connected a USB Wi-Fi dongle directly to the ESP32: the ESP32-WROOM-32U variant of the ESP32 has an antenna connector. We connect that antenna connector to a 60 dB attenuator (this weakens the signal by 60dB), then connect that to the antenna connector of the wireless dongle. That way we’ll be able to only receive the packets coming from the ESP32, and the ESP32 will only receive packets sent by the wireless&nbsp;dongle.</p> <p>This idea unfortunately did not entirely work: enough radio waves from outside access points leaked into the antenna connector that the wireless dongle also receieved their packets. We tried to build a low-cost faraday cage from a paint can to prevent this, but this only attenuated outside signals with an extra 10dB: this removed some APs, but not all of them. The current solution is definitely not ideal, so we’ve started work on building a better and larger faraday cage, from conducting fabric and with fiber-optic data&nbsp;communication.</p> <figure> <a href="https://pics.zeus.gent/rqJc7p6pSbb6FInNNyadKy2tZy2uWqDaFtuU5KPx.jpg"> <img src="https://pics.zeus.gent/rqJc7p6pSbb6FInNNyadKy2tZy2uWqDaFtuU5KPx.jpg" alt="Wi-Fi dongle connected to the ESP32, with two 30 dB attenuators in between"> </a> <figcaption>Wi-Fi dongle connected to the ESP32, with two 30 dB attenuators in between</figcaption> </figure> <figure> <a href="https://pics.zeus.gent/ttmZlo7MpEP6CDzzc5q0QX4iVrg3vlsVFUAB6LEU.jpg"> <img src="https://pics.zeus.gent/ttmZlo7MpEP6CDzzc5q0QX4iVrg3vlsVFUAB6LEU.jpg" alt="Faraday cage made from a paint tin, with copper tape to close the hole for the USB connectors, and ferrite chokes to reduce the RF leaking in"> </a> <figcaption>Faraday cage made from a paint tin, with copper tape to close the hole for the USB connectors, and ferrite chokes to reduce the RF leaking in</figcaption> </figure> <h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2> <h3 id="softmac-vs-hardmac">SoftMAC vs&nbsp;HardMAC</h3> <p>SoftMAC (Software MAC) and HardMAC (Hardware MAC) refer to two different approaches for implementing the MAC layer for Wi-Fi. SoftMAC relies on software to manage MAC layer functions, which offers flexibility and ease of modification but can consume more power/CPU cycles. HardMAC, on the other hand, offloads MAC layer processing to dedicated hardware, reducing CPU usage and power consumption but limiting the ability to adapt to new features without hardware&nbsp;changes.</p> <p>The ESP32 seems to use a SoftMAC approach: you can directly send and receive 802.11 frames (instead of with HardMAC, where you tell the hardware you want to connect to a certain AP, and it would then automatically craft the nescessary frames and send them). This is good news for our open source implementation, since there already exist open-source 802.11 MAC stacks for SoftMAC (for example, mac80211 in the Linux&nbsp;kernel).</p> <h3 id="peripherals">Peripherals</h3> <p>The Wi-Fi functionality is implemented via multiple hardware peripherals, each responsible for a separate part of the functionality. Through reverse engineering, the following peripherals were identified as ‘used for Wi-Fi functionaliy’ (these are memory addresses, through which the peripherals can be&nbsp;accessed):</p> <ul> <li>MAC peripherals, at 0x3ff73000 to 0x3ff73fff and at 0x3ff74000 to&nbsp;0x3ff74fff</li> <li>RX control registers, at 0x3ff5c000 to&nbsp;0x3ff5cfff</li> <li>baseband, at 0x3ff5d000 to&nbsp;0x3ff5dfff</li> <li> <code>chipv7_phy</code> (?) at 3ff71000 to&nbsp;3ff71fff</li> <li> <code>chipv7_wdev</code> (?) at 3ff75000 to&nbsp;3ff75fff</li> <li>RF frontend, at 3ff45000 to 3ff45fff and 3ff46000 to&nbsp;3ff46fff</li> <li>analog at 3ff4e000 to 3ff4efff (this is also used by the DAC connected to GPIO&nbsp;pins)</li> </ul> <p>It should be noted that these peripherals are mirrored to another place in the address&nbsp;space:</p> <blockquote> <p>Peripherals accessed by the CPU via 0x3FF40000 ~ 0x3FF7FFFF address space (DPORT address) can also be accessed via 0x60000000 ~ 0x6003FFFF (AHB address). (0x3FF40000 + n) address and (0x60000000 + n) address access the same content, where n = 0 ~&nbsp;0x3FFFF.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="lifecyle">Lifecyle</h3> <p>By writing some minimal firmware that just sends packets in a loop and using the three reverse engineer strategies described earlier, a high level overview of the Wi-Fi hardware lifecycle for sending a packet was&nbsp;determined:</p> <ol> <li>Calling <code>esp_wifi_start()</code>, this indirectly calls&nbsp;<code>esp_phy_enable()</code> </li> <li> <code>esp_phy_enable()</code> is responsible for initializing the wifi&nbsp;hardware: <ol> <li>Calibrate the PHY hardware: this tries to compensate imperfections of the hardware. According to the data sheet, this does, at least: I/Q phase matching; antenna matching; compensating carrier leakage, baseband nonlinearities, power amplifier nonlinearities and RF nonlinearities (I’m more of a software person than an electronic engineer, so I don’t exactly know what these terms mean). This calibration can be stored to the non-volatile storage and to memory. This is used so we don’t have to do a full calibration every time the ESP32 wakes up from modem&nbsp;sleep.</li> <li>Initialize the MAC peripherals: set RX MAC address filters, set the buffers where the packets will be received into, set the auto-ACKing policy, set the chips own MAC&nbsp;address.</li> <li>Set various physical radio properties (TX rate, frequency, TX power,&nbsp;…)</li> <li>Set up the power management timer: if packets are not sent often enough, the modem power save timer kicks in and de-initializes part of the Wi-Fi hardware to save&nbsp;power.</li> </ol> </li> <li>Now, we’re ready to send a&nbsp;packet: <ol> <li>Wake up some Wi-Fi peripherals from deep sleep and restore their calibration, if we need&nbsp;to</li> <li>Set some metadata, related to the packet (likely the rate and other PHY&nbsp;settings)</li> <li>Create a DMA entry, consisting of the length of the packet and the address of the buffer containing the MAC data. The MAC Frame Checksum is automatically calculated by the hardware. DMA stands for Direct Memory Access: that means that we just tell the hardware the address and length of where our packet is, and the hardware will then read that memory and transmit the packet, all on its&nbsp;own.</li> <li>Write the lowest bits of the DMA entry into a hardware register, then enable it for transmission by setting a bit in the bitmask of that&nbsp;register.</li> <li>Once the packet is sent, interrupt 0 will fire to notify us how succesful the transmission was. We can react to collisions and timeouts (and probably also to ACKs received?). We also have to clear the interrupt bit that indicates a packet was&nbsp;sent.</li> </ol> </li> </ol> <h3 id="implementing-transmitting-packets">Implementing transmitting&nbsp;packets</h3> <p>As a (very limited) proof-of-concept, we wanted to send arbitrary 802.11 frames by directly using the memory mapped peripherals, so without using the SDK functions. As you can see in the lifecycle diagram above, before transmitting, we first need to initialize the wifi hardware. Unfortunately, this initialization is a lot more complex than sending packets: to intialize the hardware, about 50000 peripheral memory accesses are needed, compared to about 50 for transmitting a packet (including handling the interrupt). These are not exact numbers at all, but they give an idea about the complexity&nbsp;involved.</p> <p>For the basic ‘transmitting packets’ proof-of-concept, we are currently still using the proprietary functions to initialize the wifi hardware. We encountered the issue that after initializing, the modem power save timer would kick in and de-initialize the wifi peripherals, preventing us from sending packets. To work around this, we send a single packet using the SDK and then immediately call the undocumented <code>pm_disconnected_stop()</code> function, which disables the modem power save mode timer. After this, we can send arbitrary packets by directly writing to the MAC peripheral addresses. For this PoC, we don’t need to replace the interrupt handler for wifi events: the existing, proprietary handler will handle the ‘packet was sent’ interrupt just&nbsp;fine.</p> <p>The <a href="https://github.com/esp32-open-mac/esp32-open-mac">basic proof of concept</a> works, we can transmit arbitrary packets by directly writing and reading from memory&nbsp;addresses!</p> <h2 id="current-roadmap">Current&nbsp;roadmap</h2> <p>Now we can transmit packets, but we still have a lot of work ahead of us: this is the to-do list, in rough order of&nbsp;priorities</p> <ul> <li>☑ Send&nbsp;packets</li> <li>☐ Receive packets: to do this, we will need to do the&nbsp;following: <ul> <li>Set the RX policy (this filters packets based on MAC address) / enable promiscous mode to receive all&nbsp;packets</li> <li>Set the memory address in which we want to receive the packet via&nbsp;DMA</li> <li>Replace the wifi interrupt with our own interrupt; the code indicates that there might be some kind of wifi watchdog, we’ll need to figure out how to pet&nbsp;it.</li> </ul> </li> <li>☐ Send ACK (acknowledgment) packets back if we receive a packet that is destined for&nbsp;us</li> <li>☐ Implement changing the wifi channel, rate, transmit power,&nbsp;…</li> <li>☐ Combine our implementation with an existing open source 802.11 MAC stack, so the ESP32 can associate with access&nbsp;points</li> <li>☐ Implement the hardware initialization (now done by <code>esp_phy_enable()</code>). This will be a hard undertaking, since all calibration routines will need to be implemented, but also has a high payoff: we’ll then have a completely blob-free firmware for the&nbsp;ESP32.</li> </ul> <p>And a list of possible future extensions that are not yet on the roadmap, but are useful to do&nbsp;anyways:</p> <ul> <li>☐ Implement modem power saving: turning off the modem when not in&nbsp;use</li> <li>☐ AMSDU, AMPDU, HT40,&nbsp;QoS</li> <li>☐ Do the cryptography needed for WPA2 etc in hardware instead of in&nbsp;software</li> <li>☐&nbsp;Bluetooth</li> <li>☐ Write SVD documentation for all reverse engineered registers. An SVD file is an XML file that describes the hardware features of a microcontroller, this makes it possible to automatically generate an API from the hardware description. Espressif already has an SVD file containing the documented hardware registers; we can document the undocumented registers and (automatically) merge them&nbsp;in.</li> </ul> <h2 id="code">Code</h2> <p>All code and documentation is available in the <a href="https://github.com/esp32-open-mac/">esp32-open-mac GitHub organisation</a>. I think especially the QEMU fork can be useful for other reverse engineers because of the memory tracing&nbsp;feature.</p> <h2 id="update">Update</h2> <p>Since the beginning of writing this blog post, receiving packets was also implemented. To accomplish this, we needed to implement the Wi-Fi MAC interrupt handler and manage the RX DMA buffers. This means that we now can send and receive packets using only open source code: the hardware initialization is still done with proprietary code, but after this setup is done, only open source code is used to send and receive packets, no more proprietary code is executed. The second part is <a href="https://zeus.ugent.be/blog/23-24/esp32-reverse-engineering-continued/">here</a></p> <h2 id="questions-want-to-collaborate">Questions? Want to&nbsp;collaborate?</h2> <p>This is a sizeable project that could definitely use multiple contributors; I’d really like to collaborate with other people to create a fully functional, open-source Wi-Fi stack for the ESP32.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-13a3556e=""><p>Today marks a bright moment in the efforts to keep the internet a neutral and trusted resource for everyone.</p>
<p>Quad9 has received word from the courts in Dresden, Germany in the appeal of our case versus Sony Entertainment (Germany). The court has ruled in favor of Quad9, clearly and unequivocally. The text from the court is available here <a href="https://quad9.net/uploads/URT_05_12_2023_redacted_de2_1880f3f6c4.pdf">in German</a> and <a href="https://quad9.net/uploads/URT_05_12_2023_en_Korr_MH_en2_2e629b1f7b.pdf">in English</a>.</p>
<p>Needless to say, we are elated at the news.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Sony Entertainment (Germany) started a legal proceeding against Quad9 more than two years ago to force Quad9 to stop resolving certain domain names which they claimed were involved in copyright infringement behavior.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.quad9.net/news/blog/quad9-and-sony-music-german-injunction-update-for-july-2023/" target="_blank">07/2023</a></li>

<li><a href="https://quad9.net/news/blog/an-update-to-the-quad9-and-sony-music-german-court-injunction-august-2022/" target="_blank">08/2022</a></li>
<li><a href="https://quad9.net/news/blog/quad9-files-official-objection-opposing-sony-music-s-german-court-ruling/" target="_blank">09/2021</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We believe this lawsuit was an attempt to set a precedent, such that commercial rights holders could demand that sites on the internet be made unreachable by forcing recursive resolvers to block content. We contended that recursive resolvers have no commercial or even remotely indirect relationship to any of the infringing parties, and that Sony’s demand for blocking was ineffective, inappropriately specified, and not related to Quad9.</p>
<p>What made this case more problematic, in our view, was that the servers in question in this case were not located in Germany, and the links they pointed to were on servers also not in Germany. The domain name (<code>canna.to</code>) was not registered in Germany and was under the top-level-domain operated by the nation of Tonga. Sony Entertainment further asserted that we block the domains globally, not just in Germany, as geoIP does not block for users based in Germany with certainty. For that matter, Quad9 has no office or standing in Germany (we are a Swiss entity), but due to the Lugano Convention treaty it was possible for Sony to serve an injunction in Switzerland and drag Quad9 into legal proceedings.</p>
<h2>Details on Judgement</h2>
<p>The appeal with the Higher Regional Court in Dresden follows a decision by the Regional Court in Leipzig, in which Sony prevailed, and Quad9 was convicted as a wrongdoer. Before that, Sony successfully obtained a preliminary junction against Quad9 with the Regional Court in Hamburg. The objection against the preliminary injunction by Quad9 was unsuccessful, and the appeal with the Higher Regional Court in Hamburg was withdrawn by Quad9 since a decision in the main proceeding was expected to be made earlier than the conclusion of the appeal in the preliminary proceedings.</p>
<p>Please find below a table summarizing the main take-aways from the decision in Dresden. For more information on these points, please go <a href="https://quad9.net/uploads/2023_12_06_Comparison_of_processes_aad2df4618.pdf">here</a>.</p>

</table>
<p>The court has also ruled that the case cannot be taken to a higher court and their decision is the final word in this particular case. Sony may appeal the appeal closure via a complaint against the denial of leave of appeal and then would have to appeal the case itself with the German Federal Court. So while there is still a possibility that this case could continue, Sony would have to win twice to turn the decision around again.</p>
<p>We would also like to clarify that even though Quad9 benefits from the liability privileges as a mere conduit, it is possible that a DNS resolver operator can be required to block as a matter of last resort if the claiming party has taken appropriate means to go after the wrongdoer and the hosting company unsuccessfully. Such measures could be legal action by applying for a preliminary injunction against a hosting company within the EU. These uncertainties still linger, and we expect that this ongoing question of what circumstances require what actions, by what parties, will continue to be argued in court and in policy circles over the next few years.</p>
<p>We remain committed to the concept that resolving a domain name is not an action that should be prohibited for commercial goals. The DNS does not contain content - it is a system designed for delivery only of pointers, not for data transport.</p>
<p>The courts in Cologne also recently ruled in favor of Cloudflare in a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/latest-copyright-decision-in-germany-rejects-blocking-through-global-dns-resolvers/" target="_blank">similar case</a> involving DNS recursive resolution (though that case is more complex as it involves content hosting or proxying) and we are pleased to have consistent and clear statements from both courts in this matter of DNS recursive resolution.</p>
<p>Today was a significant win in Germany, but there is some disappointment as well. We received a notice from a consortium of Italian rightsholders (Sony Music Italy, Universal Music Italy, Warner Music Italy, and Federation of Italian Music Industry) who have demanded that Quad9 block domains in Italy, and there is potentially another court process ahead of us. We have a blog post on that <a href="https://quad9.net/news/blog/italian-blocking-demands-following-a-bad-example">here</a>, also published today.</p>
<h2>Actions taken</h2>
<p>From a practical perspective, Quad9 has removed the blocks on all domains previously noted by Sony and documented in the lower courts. Those domains are listed below. Currently, there are no domains now being blocked in Germany or anywhere else related to this case.</p>
<h2>Thanks to those who believed in us and in your rights</h2>
<p>There are hundreds of individual supporters that we wish to thank for their monetary support, advice, and willingness to speak up in public - social media, blogs, and in industry settings. In particular, we would like to thank our legal team at <a href="https://rickert.law/" target="_blank">Rickert.law</a> - Thomas Rickert and Sandra Schulte - who gave us an enormously generous amount of effort and time spent on achieving this win. We'd also like to thank the <a href="https://freiheitsrechte.org/" target="_blank">GFF</a> for their legal advice, continued advisement on German media issues, and for being a sounding board for our legal team and management. We would also like to thank the Kahle Austin Family Foundation, and <a href="https://www.stiftung-mercator.ch/" target="_blank">Stiftung Mercator Schweiz</a>, and <a href="https://www.eco.de/" target="_blank">eco</a> for their support.</p>
<p>To those who have donated to Quad9: By helping us, you helped yourself. It is clear to us that expansionism of internet censorship will never stop and letting minor inappropriate removals of digital sovereignty go without challenge will ultimately end with heavy-handed suppression of ideas much closer to the user. Those boundaries are constantly being tested, and we have won this round. You have kept the front lines from moving closer to you - congratulations!</p>
<p>Quad9 is a non-profit organization, and the costs of pursuing court cases is a heavy burden which takes away our ability to expand the network as quickly as we need. We will continue to need that help in the next phases of our defense of the DNS. Please consider <a href="https://www.quad9.net/donate" target="_blank">donating</a> - every euro counts as we continue to fight for your ability to use the DNS. Thank you for making this possible for us.</p>
<p>Regardless of our victory in this case, the costs to Quad9 have been extensive and excessive from a real monetary perspective as well as a time and attention drain. If you feel like we have done service for you in this court case, please consider <a href="https://www.quad9.net/donate" target="_blank">donating</a> to Quad9 so that we can catch up to where we should have been by now with other costs related to our continued service.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The Wikimedia Foundation — the nonprofit that hosts Wikipedia and other <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/our-work/wikimedia-projects/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wikimedia projects</a> — has announced the launch of <a href="https://www.wikifunctions.org/wiki/Wikifunctions:Main_Page" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wikifunctions</a>, its first new project in over a decade. The project will enable volunteer editors to collaboratively create and maintain a library of functions to answer questions and enhance knowledge on Wikimedia projects and beyond.</p><article>
		


<p>A “function” is a sequence of programming instructions that makes a calculation based on data provided. Internet users most commonly encounter functions when entering queries on search engines, such as the time difference between two cities, the distance between two locations, or the volume of an object. Functions operate behind-the-scenes to produce answers to these queries. For the first time, Wikifunctions will provide a library of functions that everyone, everywhere can access and contribute to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notably, these functions can exist in any language; therefore, for many Wikifunctions users, this will be the first project where they can read and write functions in their native language.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Functions are pathways to knowledge. Wikifunctions aims to make these pathways more accessible than ever before.&nbsp; Imagine a programming system where a single line of code can be run from anywhere by anyone — even by programs written in different programming languages. That is the promise and potential of Wikifunctions,” said Dr. Denny Vrandečić, Head of Special Projects at the Wikimedia Foundation. “Wikifunctions will be built in the same community-led fashion as Wikipedia, with volunteer editors donating their time and energy to the cause of building a freely editable library of valuable functions. We are excited for this project to continue to grow with their contributions.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Currently, functions on Wikimedia projects are complex, siloed, and vary by language versions of various projects (Wikipedia alone has over 300 language versions). Wikifunctions will place functions in a single shared space, simplifying the work of the volunteers who maintain them and increasing their accessibility. Wikifunctions will eventually integrate with Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects, opening new opportunities for knowledge creation.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;“Wikifunctions will bring together different data sources from other Wikimedia projects in new and powerful ways, ultimately leveraging functional code to create new forms of knowledge,”&nbsp; said <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/en/?profile=selena-deckelmann" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Selena Deckelmann</a>, Chief Product and Technology Officer at the Wikimedia Foundation. “We are excited to announce Wikifunctions as yet another step in getting us closer to <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/about/vision/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our vision</a> of a world where everyone can freely share in the sum of all knowledge.”</p>

<p>Wikifunctions is the underlying technical infrastructure that will support a <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Wikipedia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wider initiative</a> by the Wikimedia Foundation to enable people to share more knowledge in more languages across Wikipedia.&nbsp; Through this initiative, users will be able to create and maintain content in their native language, which others can access in over 300 languages available on Wikimedia projects. The long-term aim of this effort is to create knowledge that is independent of language, and easier for Wikipedia editors to share, add, translate, and improve across languages on the online encyclopedia. The work is being supported by grants from <a href="https://www.google.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google.org</a>, <a href="https://www.google.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Rockefeller Foundation</a>, and <a href="https://wikimediaendowment.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Wikimedia Endowment</a>.</p>



<p>Wikifunctions was approved by the Wikimedia Foundation’s Board of Trustees <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Abstract_Wikipedia/July_2020_announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in 2020</a>. The project went live as a read-only site earlier this year, and it is now available so that anyone, anywhere can use it. It is the fourteenth Wikimedia project — the first new project in a decade.

<p>Cassandra Stumer and Silas Marvin</p>
<p>December 1, 2023</p>

<p>Last week's whirlwind of events with OpenAI CEO and founder Sam Altman stirred up quite a buzz in the industry. The whole deal left many of us scratching our heads about where OpenAI is headed. Between the corporate drama, valid worries about privacy and transparency, and ongoing issues around model performance, censorship, and the use of marketing scare tactics; it's no wonder there's a growing sense of dissatisfaction and distrust in proprietary models. </p>
<p>On the bright side, the open-source realm has emerged as a potent contender, not just in reaction to OpenAI's shortcomings but as a genuine advancement in its own right. We're all about making the benefits of open-source models accessible to as many folks as possible. So, we've made switching from OpenAI to open-source as easy as possible with a drop-in replacement. It lets users specify any model they’d like in just a few lines of code. We call it the OpenAI Switch Kit. Read on to learn more about why we think you’ll like it, or just try it now and see what you think.</p>

<p>We think so. Open-source models have made remarkable strides, not only catching up to proprietary counterparts but also surpassing them across multiple domains. The advantages are clear:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Performance &amp; reliability:</strong> Open-source models are increasingly comparable or superior across a wide range of tasks and performance metrics. Mistral and Llama-based models, for example, are easily faster than GPT 4. Reliability is another concern you may reconsider leaving in the hands of OpenAI. OpenAI’s API has suffered from several recent outages, and their rate limits can interrupt your app if there is a surge in usage. Open-source models enable greater control over your model’s latency, scalability and availability. Ultimately, the outcome of greater control is that your organization can produce a more dependable integration and a highly reliable production application. </li>
<li><strong>Safety &amp; privacy:</strong> Open-source models are the clear winner when it comes to security sensitive AI applications. There are <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news-features/chatgpts-datascraping-scrutiny/">enormous risks</a> associated with transmitting private data to external entities such as OpenAI. By contrast, open-source models retain sensitive information within an organization's own cloud environments. The data never has to leave your premises, so the risk is bypassed altogether – it’s enterprise security by default. At PostgresML, we offer such private hosting of LLM’s in your own cloud. </li>
<li><strong>Model censorship:</strong> A growing number of experts inside and outside of leading AI companies argue that model restrictions have gone too far. The Atlantic recently published an <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/11/ai-safety-regulations-uncensored-models/676076/">article on AI’s “Spicy-Mayo Problem'' </a> which delves into the issues surrounding AI censorship. The titular example describes a chatbot refusing to return commands asking for a “dangerously spicy” mayo recipe. Censorship can affect baseline performance, and in the case of apps for creative work such as Sudowrite, unrestricted open-source models can actually be a key differentiating value for users. </li>
<li><strong>Flexibility &amp; customization:</strong> Closed-source models like GPT3.5 Turbo are fine for generalized tasks, but leave little room for customization. Fine-tuning is highly restricted. Additionally, the headwinds at OpenAI have exposed the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/21/openai-dangers-vendor-lock-in/">dangerous reality of AI vendor lock-in</a>. Open-source models such as MPT-7B, Llama V2 and Mistral 7B are designed with extensive flexibility for fine tuning, so organizations can create custom specifications and optimize model performance for their unique needs. This level of customization and flexibility opens the door for advanced techniques like DPO, PPO LoRa and more. </li>
</ul>

<p>The Switch Kit is an open-source AI SDK that provides a drop in replacement for OpenAI’s chat completion endpoint.</p>

<p>We don't charge per token, so OpenAI “usage” metrics are not particularly relevant. We'll be extending this data with more direct CPU/GPU resource utilization measurements for users who are interested, or need to pass real usage based pricing on to their own customers.</p>

<p>The above is an example using our open-source AI SDK with zephyr-7b-beta, an incredibly popular and highly efficient 7 billion parameter model.</p>
<p>Notice there is near one to one relation between the parameters and return type of OpenAI’s <code>chat.completions.create</code> and our <code>chat_completion_create</code>.</p>
<p>The best part of using open-source AI is the flexibility with models. Unlike OpenAI, we are not restricted to using a few censored models, but have access to almost any model out there.</p>
<p>Here is an example of streaming with the popular Mythalion model, an uncensored MythoMax variant designed for chatting.</p>

<p>We also have asynchronous versions of the create and <code>create_stream</code> functions relatively named <code>create_async</code> and <code>create_stream_async</code>. Checkout <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5000/s/B7HH1yMjCs0skMpuwNIR/sdks/opensourceai">our documentation</a> for a complete guide of the open-source AI SDK including guides on how to specify custom models.</p>
<p>PostgresML is free and open source. To run the above examples yourself<a href="https://postgresml.org/signup"> create an account</a>, install pgml, and get running!</p>

<p>PostgresML is a complete MLOps platform in a simple PostgreSQL extension. It’s the tool our team wished they’d had scaling MLOps at Instacart during its peak years of growth. You can host your database with us or locally. However you want to engage, we know from experience that it’s better to bring your ML workload to the database rather than bringing the data to the codebase.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, PostgresML enables PostgreSQL to act as a GPU-powered AI application database — where you can both save models and index data. That eliminates the need for the myriad of separate services you have to tie together for your ML workflow. Pgml + pgvector create a complete ML platform (vector DB, model store, inference service, open-source LLMs) all within open-source extensions for PostgreSQL. That takes a lot of the complexity out of your infra, and it's ultimately faster for your users.</p>
<p>We're bullish on the power of in-database and open-source ML/AI, and we’re excited for you to see the power of this approach yourself. You can try it out in our serverless database for $0, with usage based billing starting at just five cents an hour per GB GPU cache. You can even mess with it for free on our homepage.</p>
<p>As always, let us know what you think. Get in touch via email or on our Discord if you have any questions or feedback.</p>
