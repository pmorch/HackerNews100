      <p>On September 14, 2015, <a href="https://crt.sh/?id=9314793">our first publicly-trusted certificate</a> went live. We were proud that we had issued a certificate that a significant majority of clients could accept, and had done it using <a href="https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder">automated software</a>. Of course, in retrospect this was just the first of billions of certificates. Today, Let’s Encrypt is the largest certificate authority in the world in terms of certificates issued, the ACME protocol we helped create and standardize is integrated throughout the server ecosystem, and we’ve become a household name among system administrators. We’re closing in on protecting one billion web sites.</p>
<p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/stats/"><img src="https://letsencrypt.org/images/blog/blog-2025-12-09-chart1.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>In 2023, we marked the <a href="https://www.abetterinternet.org/tenth-anniversary/">tenth anniversary of the creation of our nonprofit</a>, Internet Security Research Group, which continues to host Let’s Encrypt and other public benefit infrastructure projects. Now, in honor of the tenth anniversary of Let’s Encrypt’s public certificate issuance and the start of the general availability of our services, we’re looking back at a few milestones and factors that contributed to our success.</p>
<h2 id="growth">Growth</h2>
<p>A conspicuous part of Let’s Encrypt’s history is how thoroughly our vision of scalability through automation has succeeded.</p>
<p>In March 2016, we issued our one millionth certificate. Just two years later, in September 2018, we were issuing a million certificates every day. In 2020 we reached a billion total certificates issued and as of late 2025 we’re frequently issuing ten million certificates per day. We’re now on track to reach a billion active sites, probably sometime in the coming year. (The “certificates issued” and “certificates active” metrics are quite different because our certificates regularly expire and get replaced.)</p>
<p>The steady growth of our issuance volume shows the strength of our architecture, the validity of our vision, and the great efforts of our engineering team to scale up our own infrastructure. It also reminds us of the confidence that the Internet community is placing in us, making the use of a Let’s Encrypt certificate a normal and, dare we say, boring choice. But I often point out that our ever-growing issuance volumes are only an indirect measure of value. What ultimately matters is improving the security of people’s use of the web, which, as far as Let’s Encrypt’s contribution goes, is not measured by issuance volumes so much as by the prevalence of HTTPS encryption. For that reason, we’ve always emphasized the graph of the percentage of encrypted connections that web users make (here represented by statistics from Firefox).</p>
<p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/stats/"><img src="https://letsencrypt.org/images/blog/blog-2025-12-09-chart2.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>(These graphs are snapshots as of the date of this post; a dynamically updated version is found <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/stats/#percent-pageloads">on our stats page</a>.) Our biggest goal was to make a concrete, measurable security impact on the web by getting HTTPS connection prevalence to increase—and it’s worked. It took five years or so to get the global percentage from below 30% to around 80%, where it’s remained ever since. In the U.S. it has been close to 95% for a while now.</p>
<p>A good amount of the remaining unencrypted traffic probably comes from internal or private organizational sites (intranets), but other than that we don’t know much about it; this would be a great topic for Internet security researchers to look into.</p>
<p>We believe our present growth in certificate issuance volume is essentially coming from growth in the web as a whole. In other words, if we protect 20% more sites over some time period, it’s because the web itself grew by 20%.</p>
<h2 id="a-few-milestones">A few milestones</h2>
<p>We’ve <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/blog/">blogged about most of Let’s Encrypt’s most significant milestones</a> as they’ve happened, and I invite everyone in our community to look over those blog posts to see how far we’ve come. We’ve also <a href="https://www.abetterinternet.org/annual-reports/">published annual reports for the past seven years</a>, which offer elegant and concise summaries of our work.</p>
<p>As I personally think back on the past decade, just a few of the many events that come to mind include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2014/11/18/announcing-lets-encrypt">Telling the world about the project</a> in November 2014</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2015/09/14/our-first-cert">Our first certificate issuance</a> in September 2015</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2016/03/08/our-millionth-cert">Our one millionth certificate</a> in March 2016, then <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2017/06/28/hundred-million-certs">our 100 millionth certificate</a> in June 2017, and then <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2020/02/27/one-billion-certs">our billionth certificate</a> in 2020</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Along the way, first issuing one million certificates in a single day (in September 2018), significantly contributed to by the SquareSpace and <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2021/09/14/speed-at-scale-shopify">Shopify</a> Let’s Encrypt integrations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just at the end of September 2025, we issued more than ten million certificates in a day for the first time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve also periodically rolled out new features such as <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2016/10/21/introducing-idn-support">internationalized domain name support</a> (2016), <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2017/07/06/wildcard-certificates-coming-jan-2018">wildcard support</a> (2018), and <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2025/02/20/first-short-lived-cert-issued">short-lived</a> and <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2025/07/01/issuing-our-first-ip-address-certificate">IP address</a> (2025) certificates. We’re always working on <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/upcoming-features/">more new features</a> for the future.</p>
<p>There are many technical milestones like <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2021/01/21/next-gen-database-servers">our database server upgrades</a> in 2021, where we found we needed a serious server infrastructure boost because of the tremendous volumes of data we were dealing with. Similarly, our original infrastructure was using Gigabit Ethernet internally, and, with the growth of our issuance volume and logging, we found that our Gigabit Ethernet network eventually became too slow to synchronize database instances! (Today we’re using 25-gig Ethernet.) More recently, we’ve <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2025/06/11/reflections-on-a-year-of-sunlight">experimented with architectural upgrades</a> to our ever-growing Certificate Transparency logs, and <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2025/08/14/rfc-6962-logs-eol">decided to go ahead with deploying those upgrades</a>—to help us not just keep up with, but get ahead of, our continuing growth.</p>
<p>These kinds of growing pains and successful responses to them are nice to remember because they point to the inexorable increase in demands on our infrastructure as we’ve become a more and more essential part of the Internet. I’m proud of our technical teams which have handled those increased demands capably and professionally.</p>
<p>I also recall the ongoing work involved in <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2018/08/06/trusted-by-all-major-root-programs">making sure our certificates would be as widely accepted as possible</a>, which has meant managing the original cross-signature from IdenTrust, and <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2020/11/06/own-two-feet">subsequently creating and propagating our own root CA certificates</a>. This process has required PKI engineering, key ceremonies, root program interactions, documentation, and community support associated with certificate migrations. Most users never have reason to look behind the scenes at <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/">our chains of trust</a>, but our engineers update it as root and intermediate certificates have been replaced. We’ve engaged at the <a href="https://cabforum.org/">CA/B Forum</a>, <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a>, and in other venues with the browser root programs to help shape the web PKI as a technical leader.</p>
<p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2020/12/28/executive-director-letter">As I wrote in 2020</a>, our ideal of complete automation of the web PKI aims at a world where most site owners wouldn’t even need to think about certificates at all. We continue to get closer and closer to that world, which creates a risk that people will take us and our services for granted, as the details of certificate renewal occupy less of site operators’ mental energy. As I said at the time,</p>
<p>When your strategy as a nonprofit is to get out of the way, to offer services that people don’t need to think about, you’re running a real risk that you’ll eventually be taken for granted. There is a tension between wanting your work to be invisible and the need for recognition of its value. If people aren’t aware of how valuable our services are then we may not get the support we need to continue providing them.</p>
<p>I’m also grateful to our communications and fundraising staff who help make clear what we’re doing every day and how we’re making the Internet safer.</p>
<h2 id="recognition-of-let-s-encrypt">Recognition of Let’s Encrypt</h2>
<p>Our community continually recognizes our work in tangible ways by using our certificates—now by the tens of millions per day—and by <a href="https://www.abetterinternet.org/sponsor/">sponsoring us</a>.</p>
<p>We were honored to be recognized with awards including the <a href="https://rwc.iacr.org/LevchinPrize/winners.html#certs">2022 Levchin Prize for Real-World Cryptography</a> and the <a href="https://www.abetterinternet.org/documents/2019-ISRG-Annual-Report-Desktop.pdf">2019 O’Reilly Open Source Award</a>. In October of this year some of the individuals who got Let’s Encrypt started were honored to receive the <a href="https://secdev.ieee.org/2025/awardees/">IEEE Cybersecurity Award for Practice</a>.</p>
<p>We documented the history, design, and goals of the project in <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3319535.3363192">an academic paper at the ACM CCS ‘19 conference</a>, which has subsequently been cited hundreds of times in academic research.</p>

<p>Ten years later, I’m still deeply grateful to the five initial sponsors that got Let’s Encrypt off the ground - Mozilla, EFF, Cisco, Akamai, and IdenTrust. When they committed significant resources to the project, it was just an ambitious idea. They saw the potential and believed in our team, and because of that we were able to build the service we operate today.</p>
<h2 id="identrust-a-critical-technical-partner">IdenTrust: A critical technical partner</h2>
<p>I’d like to particularly recognize <a href="https://www.identrust.com/">IdenTrust</a>, a PKI company that worked as a partner from the outset and enabled us to issue publicly-trusted certificates via a cross-signature from one of their roots. We would simply not have been able to launch our publicly-trusted certificate service without them. Back when I first told them that we were starting a new nonprofit certificate authority that would give away millions of certificates for free, there wasn’t any precedent for this arrangement, and there wasn’t necessarily much reason for IdenTrust to pay attention to our proposal. But the company really understood what we were trying to do and was willing to engage from the beginning. Ultimately, IdenTrust’s support made our original issuance model a reality.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I’m proud of what we have achieved with our staff, partners, and donors over the past ten years. I hope to be even more proud of the next ten years, as we use our strong footing to continue to pursue our mission to protect Internet users by lowering monetary, technological, and informational barriers to a more secure and privacy-respecting Internet.</p>
<p>Let’s Encrypt is a project of the nonprofit Internet Security Research Group, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. You can help us make the next ten years great as well by <a href="http://letsencrypt.org/donate">donating</a> or becoming a <a href="https://www.abetterinternet.org/sponsor/">sponsor</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <p><strong>Stephen Ramsay</strong></p>
    <p>Or hell, why not do it in <em>x86 assembly?</em></p>
    <p>Let’s get a few things out of the way before I go any
    further with this seemingly impertinent thought, because it’s
    nowhere near as snarky as it sounds.</p>
    <p>First, I don’t particularly <em>like</em> vibe coding. I
    love programming, and I have loved it since I made my first
    tentative steps with it sometime back in the mid-to-late 90s. I
    love programming so much, it always feels like I’m having too
    much fun for it to count as real work. I’ve done it
    professionally, but I also do it as a hobby. Someone apparently
    once said, “Do what you love and you’ll never work a day in
    your life.” That’s how I feel about writing code. I’ve also
    been teaching the subject for twenty-five years, and I can
    honestly say I am as excited about the first day of the
    semester now as I was when I first started. I realize it’s a
    bit precious to say so, but I’ll say it anyway: Turning
    non-programmers into programmers is my life’s work. It is the
    thing of which I am most proud as a college professor.</p>
    <p>Vibe coding makes me feel <em>dirty</em> in ways that I
    struggle to articulate precisely. It’s not just that it feels
    like “cheating” (though it does). I also think it takes a lot
    of the fun out of the whole thing. I sometimes tell people
    (like the aforementioned students) that programming is like
    doing the best crossword puzzle in the world, except that when
    you solve it, it actually dances and sings. Vibe coding robs me
    of that moment, because I don’t feel like <em>I</em> really did
    it at all. And even though to be a programmer is to live with a
    more-or-less permanent set of aporias (you don’t
    <em>really</em> understand what the compiler is doing,
    really—and even if you do, you probably don’t <em>really</em>
    understand how the virtual memory subsystem works, really),
    it’s satisfying to understand every inch of my code and
    frustrating—all the way to the borderlands of active
    anxiety—not quite understanding what Claude just wrote.</p>
    <p>But this leads me to my second point, which I must make as
    clearly and forcefully as I can. Vibe coding actually works. It
    creates robust, complex systems that work. You can tell
    yourself (as I did) that it can’t possibly do that, but you are
    wrong. You can then tell yourself (as I did) that it’s good as
    a kind of alternative search engine for coding problems, but
    not much else. You are also wrong about that. Because when you
    start giving it little programming problems that you can’t be
    arsed to work out yourself (as I did), you discover (as I did)
    that it’s awfully good at those. And then one day you muse out
    loud (as I did) to an AI model something like, “I have an idea
    for a program…” And you are astounded. If you aren’t astounded,
    you either haven’t actually done it or you are at some stage of
    grief prior to acceptance. Perfect? Hardly. But then neither
    are human coders. The future? I think the questions answers
    itself.</p>
    <p>But to get to my impertinent question…</p>
    <p>Early on in my love affair with programming, I read <a href="https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf"><em>Structure and
    Interpretation of Computer Programs,</em></a> which I now
    consider one of the great pedagogical masterpieces of the
    twentieth century. I learned a great deal about programming
    from that book, but among the most memorable lessons was one
    that appears in the second paragraph of the original preface.
    There, Hal Abelson and Gerald Sussman make a point that hits
    with the force of the obvious, and yet is very often
    forgotten:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>[W]e want to establish the idea that a computer language
      is not just a way of getting a computer to perform operations
      but rather that it is a novel formal medium for expressing
      ideas about methodology. Thus, programs must be written for
      people to read, and only incidentally for machines to
      execute.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I’ve been repeating some version of this to my students ever
    since. Computers, I remind them, do not need the code to be
    “readable” or “ergonomic” for humans; they only need it to be
    readable and ergonomic for a computer, which is a considerably
    lower bar.</p>
    <p>Every programming language—<em>including assembly
    language</em>—was and is intended for the convenience of humans
    who need to read it and write it. If a language is innovative,
    it is usually not because it has <em>allowed</em> for automatic
    memory management, or concurrency, or safety, or robust error
    checking, but because it has made it easier for humans to
    express and reason about these matters. When we extol the
    virtues of this or that language—Rust’s safety guarantees,
    C++’s “no-cost abstractions,” or Go’s approach to
    concurrency—we are not talking about an affordance that the
    computer has gained, but about an affordance that <em>we</em>
    have gained as programmers of said computer. From our
    standpoint as programmers, object-oriented languages offer
    certain ways to organize our code—and, I think Abelson and
    Sussman would say, our thinking—that are potentially conducive
    to the noble treasures of maintainability, extensibility, error
    checking, and any number of other condign matters. From the
    standpoint of the computer, this little OO kink of ours seems
    mostly to indicate a strange affinity for heap memory.
    “Whatevs!” (says the computer). And pick your poison here,
    folks: functional programming, algebraic data types, dependent
    types, homoiconicity, immutable data structures, brace styles…
    We can debate the utility of these things, but we must
    understand that we are primarily talking about <em>human</em>
    problems. The set of “machine problems” to which these matters
    correspond is considerably smaller.</p>
    <p>So my question is this: Why vibe code with a language that
    has <em>human</em> convenience and ergonomics in view? Or to
    put that another way: Wouldn’t a language designed <em>for vibe
    coding</em> naturally dispense with much of what is convenient
    and ergonomic <em>for humans</em> in favor of what is
    convenient and ergonomic for machines? Why not have it just
    write C? Or hell, why not x86 assembly?</p>
    <p>Now, at this point, you will want to say that the need for
    human understanding isn’t erased entirely thereby. Some version
    of this argument has merit, but I would remind you that if you
    are really vibe coding for real you already don’t understand a
    great deal of what it is producing. But if you look carefully,
    you will notice that it doesn’t struggle with undefined
    behavior in C. Or with making sure that all memory is properly
    freed. Or with off-by-one errors. It sometimes struggles to
    understand what it is that you actually want, but it rarely
    struggles with the actual execution of the code. It’s better
    than you are at keeping track of those things in the same way
    that a compiler is better at optimizing code than you are.
    Perfect? No.&nbsp;But as I said before…</p>
    <p>Is C the ideal language for vibe coding? I think I could
    mount an argument for why it is not, but surely Rust is even
    less ideal. To say nothing of Haskell, or OCaml, or even
    Python. All of these languages, after all, are for people to
    read, and only incidentally for machines to execute. They are
    practically adorable in their concern for problems that AI
    models do not have.</p>
    <p>I suppose what I’m getting at, here, is that <em>if</em>
    vibe coding is the future of software development (and it is),
    then why bother with languages that were designed for people
    who are not vibe coding? Shouldn’t there be such a thing as a
    “vibe-oriented programming language?” VOP. You read it here
    first.</p>
    <p>One possibility is that such a language truly would be
    executable pseudocode beyond even the most extravagant fever
    dreams of the most earnest Pythonistas; it shows you what it’s
    doing in truly pseudo code, but all the while it’s writing
    assembly. Or perhaps it’s something like the apotheosis of
    literate programming. You write a literary document “expressing
    ideas about methodology,” and the AI produces machine code (and
    a kind of literary critical practice evolves around this
    activity, eventually ordering itself into structuralist and
    post-structuralist camps. But I’m getting ahead of myself).
    Perhaps your job as a programmer is mostly running tests that
    verify this machine code (tests which have also been produced
    by AI). Or maybe a VOPL is really a certain kind of language
    that comes closer to natural language than any existing
    programming language, but which has a certain (easily learned)
    set of idioms and expressions that guide the AI more reliably
    and more quickly toward particular solutions. It doesn’t have
    goroutines. It has a “concurrency slang.”</p>
    <p>Now obviously, the reason a large language model focused on
    coding is good at Javascript and C++ is precisely because it
    has been trained on billions of lines of code in those
    languages along with countless forum posts, StackOverflow
    debates, and so on. Bootstrapping a VOPL presents a certain
    kind of difficulty, but then one also suspects that LLMs are
    <em>already</em> being trained in some future version of this
    language, because so many programmers are already groping their
    way toward a system like this by virtue of the fact that so
    many of them are already vibe coding production-level
    systems.</p>
    <p>I don’t know how I feel about all of this (see my first and
    second points above). It saddens me to think of “coding by
    hand” becoming a kind of quaint Montessori-school stage in the
    education of a vibe coder—something like the contour drawings
    we demand from future photoshopers or the balanced equations we
    insist serve as a rite of passage for people who will never be
    without a calculator to the end of their days.</p>
    <p>At the same time, there is something exciting about the
    birth of a computational paradigm. It wasn’t that long ago, in
    the grand scheme of things, that someone realized that rewiring
    the entire machine every time you wanted to do a calculation
    (think ENIAC, circa 1945) was a rather suboptimal way to do
    things. And it is worth recalling that people
    <em>complained</em> when the stored-program computer rolled
    around (think EDVAC, circa 1951). Why? Well, the answer should
    be obvious. It was less reliable. It was slower. It removed the
    operator from the loop. It threatened specialized labor. It was
    conceptually impure. I’m not kidding about any of this. No less
    an authority than Grace Hopper had to argue against the quite
    popular idea that there was no way anyone could ever trust a
    machine to write instructions for another machine.</p>
    <p>Same vibe, as the kids say.</p>

                                    <br>It was created by <strong>mr.doob</strong> (<a href="https://x.com/mrdoob" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">X</a>, <a href="http://github.com/mrdoob" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a>), followed by hundreds of awesome developers, one of which being Sunag (<a href="https://x.com/sea3dformat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">X</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sunag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a>) who added <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Three.js-Shading-Language" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">TSL</a>, enabling the use of both WebGL and WebGPU, making this portfolio possible.

                                    I’ve been making devlogs since the very start of this portfolio and you can find them on my <a href="https://youtube.com/@BrunoSimon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Youtube channel</a>.
                                    <br>Even though the portfolio is out, I’m still working on the last videos so that the series is complete.

<div><p>While we will never be able to get folks to stop using AI to “help” them shape their replies, it’s super annoying to have folks think that by using AI that they’re doing others a favor.

<div><p>To me, the valuable comments are the ones that share the writer's expertise and experiences (as opposed to opinions and hypothesizing) or the ones that ask interesting questions.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><img src="https://repebble.com/assets/meet-pebble-index-01-external-memory-for-your-brain-0-blackhero.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy"></span></p>
<p><strong>Catch your best ideas before they slip through your fingers</strong></p>
<p>Do you ever have flashes of insight or an idea worth remembering? This happens to me 5-10 times every day. If I don’t write down the thought immediately, it slips out of my mind. Worst of all, I <em>remember</em> that I’ve forgotten something and spend the next 10 minutes trying to remember what it is. So I invented external memory for my brain.</p>
<p><strong>Introducing</strong> <strong>Pebble Index 01</strong> - a small ring with a button and microphone. Hold the button, whisper your thought, and it’s sent to your phone. It’s added to your notes, set as a reminder, or saved for later review.</p>
<p>Index 01 is designed to become muscle memory, since it’s always with you. It’s private by design (no recording until you press the button) and requires no internet connection or paid subscription. It’s as small as a wedding band and comes in 3 colours. It’s made from durable stainless steel and is water-resistant. Like all Pebble products, it’s extremely customizable and built with open source software.</p>
<p>Here’s the best part: the battery lasts for years. You never need to charge it.</p>
<p><a href="https://repebble.com/index#buy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pre-order today for $75</a>. After worldwide shipping begins in March 2026, the price will go up to $99.</p>

<h3 id="design"><a href="#design"><span>#</span>Design</a></h3>
<p>Now that I’ve worn my Index 01 for several months, I can safely say that it has changed my life - just like with Pebble, I couldn’t go back to a world without this. There are so many situations each day where my hands are full (while biking or driving, washing dishes, wrangling my kids, etc) and I need to remember something. A random sampling of my recent recordings:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Set a timer for 3pm to go pick up the kids</em></li>
<li><em>Remind me to phone the pharmacy at 11am</em></li>
<li><em>Peter is coming by tomorrow at 11:30am, add that to my calendar</em></li>
<li><em>Jerry recommends reading Breakneck</em></li>
<li><em>Mark wants a Black/Red PT2</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Before, I would take my phone out of my pocket to jot these down, but I couldn’t always do that (eg, while bicycling). I also wanted to start using my phone less, especially in front of my kids.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://repebble.com/assets/meet-pebble-index-01-external-memory-for-your-brain-1-2c146dc6-62c0-4079-8f46-56413e3f5ae9.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></span></p>
<p>Initially, we experimented by building this as an app on Pebble, since it has a mic and I’m always wearing one. But, I realized quickly that this was suboptimal - it required me to use my other hand to press the button to start recording (lift-to-wake gestures and wake-words are too unreliable). This was tough to use while bicycling or carrying stuff.</p>
<p>Then a genius electrical engineer friend of mine came up with an idea to fit everything into a tiny ring. It is the perfect form factor! Honestly, I’m still amazed that it all fits.</p>
<p>The design needed to satisfy several critical conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Must work reliably 100% of the time. If it didn’t work or failed to record a thought, I knew I would take it off and revert back to my old habit of just forgetting things.</li>
<li>It had to have a physical press-button, with a satisfying click-feel. I want to know for sure if the button is pressed and my thought is captured.</li>
<li>Long battery life - every time you take something off to charge, there’s a chance you’ll forget to put it back on.</li>
<li>Must be privacy-preserving. These are your inner thoughts. All recordings must be processed and stored on your phone. Only record when the button is pressed.</li>
<li>It had to be as small as a wedding band. Since it’s worn on the index finger, if it were too large or bulky, it would hit your phone while you held it in your hand.</li>
<li>Water resistance - must be able to wash hands, shower, and get wet.</li>
</ol>
<p>We’ve been working on this for a while, testing new versions and making tweaks. We’re really excited to get this out into the world.</p>
<p>Here are a few of my favourite things about Index 01:</p>
<ul>
<li>It does one thing really well - it helps me remember things.</li>
<li>It’s discreet. It's not distracting.  It doesn't take you out of the moment.</li>
<li>There’s no AI friend persona and it’s not always recording.</li>
<li>It’s inexpensive. We hope you try it and see if you like it as well!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="key-details"><a href="#key-details"><span>#</span><strong>Key Details</strong></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Available in 3 colours and 8 sizes</strong>
<ul>
<li>Colours: polished silver, polished gold, and matte black</li>
<li>US ring sizes: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13</li>
<li>You can pre-order now and pick your size/colour later before your ring ships.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cost and availability:</strong> Pre-order price is $75, rises to $99 later. Ships worldwide, beginning in March.</li>
<li><strong>Works with iPhone and Android</strong>: We overcame <a href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/apple-restricts-pebble-from-being-awesome-with-iphones" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple’s best efforts</a> to make life terrible for 3rd party accessory makers and have Index 01 working well on iOS and Android.</li>
<li><strong>Extremely private and secure</strong>: Your thoughts are processed by open source speech-to-text (STT) and AI models locally on your phone. You can read the code and see exactly how it works - our <a href="https://github.com/coredevices/mobileapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pebble mobile app</a> is open source. Higher-quality STT is available through an optional cloud service.</li>
<li><strong>No charging:</strong> The battery lasts for up to years of average use. After the end of its life, send your ring back to us for recycling.</li>
<li><strong>On-ring storage:</strong> Recording works even if your phone is out of range. Up to 5 minutes of audio can be stored on-ring, then synced later.</li>
<li><strong>No speaker or vibrating motor:</strong> This is an input device only. There is an RGB LED, but it’s rarely used (to save battery life and to reduce distraction).</li>
<li><strong>Works great with Pebble</strong> or other smartwatches: After recording, the thought will appear on your watch, and you can check that it’s correct. You can ask questions like ‘What’s the weather today?’ and see the answer on your watch.</li>
<li><strong>Raw audio playback</strong>: Very helpful if STT doesn’t work perfectly due to wind or loud background noises.</li>
<li><strong>Actions: W</strong>hile the primary task is remembering things for you, you can also ask it to do things like ’Send a Beeper message to my wife - running late’ or answer simple questions that could be answered by searching the web. You can configure button clicks to control your music - I love using this to play/pause or skip tracks. You can also configure where to save your notes and reminders (I have it set to add to Notion).</li>
<li><strong>Customizable and hackable:</strong> Configure single/double button clicks to control whatever you want (take a photo, turn on lights, Tasker, etc). Add your own voice actions via MCP. Or route the audio recordings directly to your own app or server!</li>
<li><strong>99+ languages:</strong> Speech to text and local LLM support over 99 languages! Naturally, the quality of each may vary.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="future-plans"><a href="#future-plans"><span>#</span>Future Plans</a></h3>
<p>Let me be very clear - Index 01 is designed at its core to be a device that helps you remember things. We want it to be 100% reliable at its primary task. But we’re leaving the side door open for folks to customize, build new interactions and actions.</p>
<p>Here’s how I’m thinking about it - a single click-hold + voice input will be routed to the primary memory processing path. Double-click-hold + voice input would be routed to a more general purpose voice agent (think ChatGPT with web search). Responses from the agent would be presented on Pebble (eg ‘What’s the weather tomorrow?’, ‘When’s the next northbound Caltrain?’) or other smartwatches (as a notification). Maybe this could even be an input for something like ChatGPT Voice Mode, enabling you to hear the AI response from your earbuds.</p>
<p>The built in actions, set reminder, create note, alarms, etc, are actually MCPs - basically mini apps that AI agents know how to operate. They run locally in WASM within the Pebble mobile app (no cloud MCP server required). Basically any MCP server can be used with the system, so intrepid folks may have fun adding various actions like Beeper, Google Calendar, weather, etc that already offer MCPs.</p>
<p>Not everything will be available at launch, but this is the direction we are working towards. There will be 3 ways to customize your Index 01:</p>
<ol>
<li>Trigger actions via button clicks - configure a single or double click to do things like take a photo, control your Home Assistant smart home, Tasker function, unlock your car. This will work better on Android since iOS Shortcuts doesn’t have an open API.</li>
<li>Trigger actions via voice input - write an MCP to do….basically anything? This is pretty open ended.</li>
<li>Route your voice recordings and/or transcriptions to your own webhook - or skip our AI processing entirely and send every recording to your own app or webapp.</li>
</ol>
<p>### FAQ</p>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
<p>People usually wear it on the index finger. Inside the ring is a button, a microphone, a Bluetooth chip, memory, and a battery that lasts for years. Click the button with your thumb, talk into the mic, and it records to internal memory. When your phone is in range, the recording is streamed to the Pebble app. It’s converted to text on-device, then processed by an on-device large language model (LLM) which selects an action to take (create note, add to reminders, etc).</p>
<p><strong>When do I pick my size?</strong></p>
<p>You’ll be able to pick your ring size and color after placing a pre-order. If you have a 3D printer, you can <a href="https://github.com/coredevices/hardware/tree/main/ring/pebble-index-01/3d-cad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">print our CAD designs</a> to try on. We’re also planning a sizing kit. You can view the <a href="https://repebble.com/index01-carousel/index01-dimensions.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">measurements of the inner diameter</a> of each ring size.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://repebble.com/assets/meet-pebble-index-01-external-memory-for-your-brain-4-dd455665-61da-4315-b377-e37e90cc57b3.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></span></p>
<p><strong>How long does the battery last?</strong></p>
<p>Roughly 12 to 15 hours of recording. On average, I use it 10-20 times per day to record 3-6 second thoughts. That’s up to 2 years of usage.</p>
<p><strong>Is it secure and private?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, extremely. The connection between ring and phone is encrypted. Recordings are processed locally on your phone in the open-source Pebble app. The app works offline (no internet connection) and does not require a cloud service. An optional cloud storage system for backing up recordings is available. Our plan is for this to be optionally encrypted, but we haven’t built it yet.</p>
<p><strong>Is a paid subscription required?</strong></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of battery is inside?</strong></p>
<p>Index 01 uses silver-oxide batteries.</p>
<p><strong>Why can’t it be recharged?</strong></p>
<p>We considered this but decided not to for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>You’d probably lose the charger before the battery runs out!</li>
<li>Adding charge circuitry and including a charger would make the product larger and more expensive.</li>
<li>You send it back to us to recycle.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Wait, it’s single use?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. We know this sounds a bit odd, but in this particular circumstance we believe it’s the best solution to the given set of constraints. Other smart rings like Oura cost $250+ and need to be charged every few days. We didn’t want to build a device like that.  Before the battery runs out, the Pebble app notifies and asks if you’d like to order another ring.</p>
<p><strong>Is it always listening?</strong></p>
<p>No.  It only records while the button is pressed. It’s not designed to record your whole life, or meetings.</p>
<p><strong>What if the speech-to-text processing misses a word or something?</strong></p>
<p>You can always listen to the each recording in the app.</p>
<p><strong>Why no touchpad?</strong></p>
<p>We experimented with a touchpad, but found it too easy to accidentally swipe and press. Also, nothing beats the feedback of a real gosh darn pressable button.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a speaker or vibrating motor?</strong></p>
<p>No. The button has a great click-feel to indicate when you are pressing.</p>
<p><strong>Does it do health tracking like Oura?</strong></p>
<p>Nope</p>
<p><strong>How durable and water-resistant is it?</strong></p>
<p>It’s primarily made from stainless steel 316, with a liquid silicone rubber (LSR) button. It’s water-resistant to 1 meter. You can wash your hands, do dishes, and shower with it on, but we don’t recommend swimming with it.</p>
<p><strong>Does it work with iPhone and Android?</strong></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><strong>I love customizing and hacking on my devices. What could I do with Index 01?</strong></p>
<p>Lots of stuff! Control things with the buttons. Route raw audio or transcribed text directly to your own app via webhook. Use <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MCPs</a> (also run locally on-device! No cloud server required) to add more actions.</p>
<p><strong>Is this an AI friend thingy or always-recording device?</strong></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>How far along is development?</strong></p>
<p>We’ve been working on this in the background to watch development. It helps that our Pebble Time 2 partner factory is also building Index 01!

<p dir="auto">Kaiju is a 2D/3D game engine written in Go (Golang) backed by Vulkan. The goal of the engine is to use a modern, easy, systems level programming language, with a focus on simplicity, to create a new kind of game engine.</p>

<p dir="auto">The current version of the base engine renders extremely fast, faster than most would think a garbage collected language could go. In my testing a release mode build of a game in Unity with nothing but a black background and a cube runs at about 1,600 FPS. In Kaiju, the same thing runs at around 5,400 FPS on the same machine. In fact, a complete game, with audio, custom cursors, real time PBR rendering with real time shadows, UI, and more runs at 2,712 FPS (in "debug" mode) <a href="https://x.com/ShieldCrush/status/1943516032674537958" rel="nofollow">screenshots or it didn't happen</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why Go (golang)?</h2><a id="user-content-why-go-golang" aria-label="Permalink: Why Go (golang)?" href="#why-go-golang"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I love C, and because I love C and found out that Ken Thompson played a part in designing Go, I gave Go a chance. It has been such a joy to use and work with I decided to port my C game engine to Go. Go is a modern system-level language that allows me to write code the way I want to write code and even have the opportunity to do some crazy things if I want to (no strings attached). Also the simplicity and "just works" of writing Assembly code was a great boost to my happiness.</p>
<p dir="auto">What's more, it's a language that other developers can easily learn and jump right into extending the engine/editor. No need for developers to re-figure out some bespoke macros or crazy templating nonsense. It's flat, easy, straight forward, and the foot-gun is hidden behind some walls, but there if you want it. Furthermore, developers can write their games in Go directly, no need for some alternative language that is different from the engine code (but we'll include Lua for modding).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What about the Garbage Collector?!</h2><a id="user-content-what-about-the-garbage-collector" aria-label="Permalink: What about the Garbage Collector?!" href="#what-about-the-garbage-collector"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I am creating this section because I get asked about it when I mention "Go", possibly not realizing that most public game engines use a garbage collector (GC).</p>
<p dir="auto">The GC is actually a feature I'm happy with (shocker coming from a C guy). Well, the reason is simple, if you're going to make a game engine that the public will use and needs to be stable, you need a garbage collector. Unity has C# (and possibly an internal GC as well), Unreal has a GC (and it could use a tune up if you ask me), Godot has a GC albeit their scripting language or when you use C#. It is actually very important for public engines to have a GC because people are only human and make a lot of mistakes, mistakes they'll blame on you (the engine developer) before they blame themselves.</p>
<p dir="auto">Coincidentally, the overall design I have for the engine plays very well with the GC and last I measured, I have a net-0 heap allocation while running (may need a new review). If you don't abuse the GC, you shouldn't generally feel it, it runs concurrently as well.</p>
<p dir="auto">I'll be the first to admit, I think the developers of Go can create a better GC than I can, and probably better than Unreal and Unity too.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/devstral-2-vibe-cli">https://mistral.ai/news/devstral-2-vibe-cli</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46205437">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr">Today, we're releasing Devstral 2—our next-generation coding model family available in two sizes: Devstral 2 (123B) and Devstral Small 2 (24B). Devstral 2 ships under a modified MIT license, while Devstral Small 2 uses Apache 2.0. Both are open-source and permissively licensed to accelerate distributed intelligence.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Devstral 2 is currently free to use via <a href="https://console.mistral.ai/">our API</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We are also introducing Mistral Vibe, a native CLI built for Devstral that enables end-to-end code automation.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Devstral: the next generation of SOTA coding.</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Devstral 2 is a 123B-parameter dense transformer supporting a 256K context window. It reaches 72.2% on SWE-bench Verified—establishing it as one of the best open-weight models while remaining highly cost efficient. Released under a modified MIT license, Devstral sets the open state-of-the-art for code agents.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Devstral Small 2 scores 68.0% on SWE-bench Verified, and places firmly among models up to five times its size while being capable of running locally on consumer hardware.</p>
<p><img src="https://cms.mistral.ai/assets/d295e716-acbe-4d05-8764-861ca2f2a2eb.png?width=1686&amp;height=1093" alt="Devstral   Swe Bench Verified  Open Weights Vs Proprietary Models (dark) (1)"></p>

<p dir="ltr">Devstral 2 (123B) and Devstral Small 2 (24B) are 5x and 28x smaller than DeepSeek V3.2, and 8x and 41x smaller than Kimi K2—proving that compact models can match or exceed the performance of much larger competitors. Their reduced size makes deployment practical on limited hardware, lowering barriers for developers, small businesses, and hobbyists.hardware.</p>
<p><img src="https://cms.mistral.ai/assets/3c7a5ea7-d83f-4dc4-9129-965c321bb379.png?width=1686&amp;height=969" alt="Devstral   Swe Bench Verified Regular Performance X Modelsize (dark)"></p>
<p><img src="https://cms.mistral.ai/assets/49e0d71c-436c-4334-9fff-fa68c9f60380.png?width=1686&amp;height=969" alt="Devstral   Swe Bench Verified Regular Performance X Modelsize (light)"></p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Built for production-grade workflows.</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Devstral 2 supports exploring codebases and orchestrating changes across multiple files while maintaining architecture-level context. It tracks framework dependencies, detects failures, and retries with corrections—solving challenges like bug fixing and modernizing legacy systems.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The model can be fine-tuned to prioritize specific languages or optimize for large enterprise codebases.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We evaluated Devstral 2 against DeepSeek V3.2 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 using human evaluations conducted by an independent annotation provider, with tasks scaffolded through Cline. Devstral 2 shows a clear advantage over DeepSeek V3.2, with a 42.8% win rate versus 28.6% loss rate. However, Claude Sonnet 4.5 remains significantly preferred, indicating a gap with closed-source models persists.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://cms.mistral.ai/assets/542495d8-31d9-4053-a426-df9dccc58ef1.png?width=1371&amp;height=670" alt="Devstral   Model Performance Comparison (dark) (1)"> <img src="https://cms.mistral.ai/assets/48b2b0fc-f8d8-44da-a3a2-4961aad2f10e.png?width=1371&amp;height=670" alt="Devstral   Model Performance Comparison (light) (1)"></p>
<p dir="ltr">“Devstral 2 is at the frontier of open-source coding models. In Cline, it delivers a tool-calling success rate on par with the best closed models; it's a remarkably smooth driver. This is a massive contribution to the open-source ecosystem.” — Cline.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Devstral 2 was one of our most successful stealth launches yet, surpassing 17B tokens in the first 24 hours. Mistral AI is moving at Kilo Speed with a cost-efficient model that truly works at scale.” — Kilo Code.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Devstral Small 2, a 24B-parameter model with the same 256K context window and released under Apache 2.0, brings these capabilities to a compact, locally deployable form. Its size enables fast inference, tight feedback loops, and easy customization—with fully private, on-device runtime. It also supports image inputs, and can power multimodal agents.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Mistral Vibe CLI is an open-source command-line coding assistant powered by Devstral. It explores, modifies, and executes changes across your codebase using natural language—in your terminal or integrated into your preferred IDE via the Agent Communication Protocol. It is released under the Apache 2.0 license.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Vibe CLI provides an interactive chat interface with tools for file manipulation, code searching, version control, and command execution. Key features:</p>
<ul>

ChatGPT is not "intelligence", so please don't call it "AI".
<p>
I define "intelligence" as being capable of knowing or understanding,
at least within some domain.  ChatGPT cannot know or understand
anything, so it is not intelligence.  It does not know what its
output means.  It has no idea that words can mean anything.
</p><p>
I call it a <a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#ArtificialIntelligence">"bullshit generator"</a>
because it <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-024-09775-5">generates output "with indifference to the truth"</a>.
</p><p>
The same applies to many other "generative systems", for the same
reasons
</p><p>
The widespread public error of attributing intelligence to those
systems leads millions of people to a misplaced trust for them.
Please join me in spreading the word that people should not trust
systems that mindlessly play with words to be correct in what those
words mean.
</p><p>
Another reason to reject ChatGPT in particular is that users cannot
get a copy of it.  It is unreleased software -- users cannot get even
an executable to run, let alone the source code.  The only way to use
it is by talking to a server which keeps users at arm's length.
</p><p>
Doing your own computing via software running on someone else's server
inherently <a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html">trashes your computing freedom</a>.

		<h2>The Renaissance Period</h2>



<p>We are living through a Saturn renaissance. Buckets of titles previously locked away in Japan are seeing new audiences, thanks to the herculean efforts of small but dedicated teams of enthusiast translators, removing the veil of Japanese illiteracy from before our tired eyes. Interestingly, the majority of efforts are being directed at the games with the biggest scripts, and no other genre was as impacted by the language barrier as the text-heavy, story-driven RPG. Over a dozen quality titles are now playable in English. The Saturn is, once again, ascendant…</p>



<h2>Ain’t life Grand?</h2>



<p>Enter <em>Grandia</em>.</p>



<p>What hasn’t been said about <em>Grandia</em>? In the run-up to its late 1997 release, the game enjoyed significant worldwide coverage in the gaming press, not least because some positioned it as the anti-FF7 title. Hot on the heels of the remaster of <em>Lunar: Silver Star Story</em> and hailing from respected software house Game Arts, featuring state of the art fully 3D environments, a score by notable composer Noriyuki Iwadare, sound effects produced by Skywalker Sound… <em>Grandia</em> was indeed shaping up to be one of the premier JRPG experiences of the 5th generation. There was serious talk of bringing the game out West — Working Designs was touted as the favoured house to do the honors, owing to their strong partnership with Game Arts, but the game’s massive script would have meant a late 1998 release by even the speediest conversion standards of the time. By then, the Western Saturn retail market had collapsed, and despite a shrinking but fervently dedicated base of Saturn fans holding on to hope of seeing the title cross the ocean, the game wound up locked away in Japan, forever.</p>

</div>


<h2>NEVER say Forever</h2>



<p>Game Arts subsequently ported <em>Grandia</em> to the PlayStation, dropping it in Japan in the summer of 1999. Sony speedily localized the game for Western release later that same year… but we aren’t going to focus too much on the PlayStation version here because, at the time of writing, PlayStation discs don’t boot on your SEGA Saturn. It’s the Saturn game that we are concerned with. For us Saturn stalwarts, we had to wait to the mid-2020s for <strong>an intrepid team led by TrekkiesUnite113 to <a href="https://segaxtreme.net/resources/grandia-english-patch.67/" data-type="link" data-id="https://segaxtreme.net/resources/grandia-english-patch.67/">transplant the PlayStation’s English script into the Saturn code</a></strong>. By then, the game was decades old, not to mention re-released and ‘re-mastered’ on modern platforms. So, why translate <em>Grandia</em> for the Saturn, when multiple other English options exist?</p>



<p><strong>Because <em>Grandia</em> is Best on Saturn.</strong></p>



<h2>How do you do</h2>



<p>Set in an age of discovery at the dawn of the industrial revolution, <em>Grandia</em> initially tells the tale of young Justin — a 14-year-old fearless adolescent who can’t help but dream of adventure. When he isn’t playing at “hero” with his town friends, he’s dreaming of great expeditions to find the lost civilization of Angelou. He is joined by his friend Sue — an 8-year-old girl whose maturity belies her age, and who tries desperately to keep young Justin in line. Justin’s mom Lily runs the local Seagull Restaurant and does her best to raise Justin into a respectable young man… though in her youth, she was a scrappy pirate herself. In her heart, she knows her audacious spark has passed on to her son, and that <strong>Justin will one day take up the adventurer’s mantle and take off on a grand adventure of his own</strong>, so she does her best to prepare him for when the time comes.</p>



<p><strong>She gives Justin a Spirit Stone</strong> — a remnant of the Angelou civilization and a memento of his long-lost father — and in doing so, helps kick off a fantastic voyage that sees young Justin explore, learn, overcome all manner of obstacles, and ultimately, grow and become the hero that he always imagined himself to be.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="704" height="448" src="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002388.bmp" alt="" srcset="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002388.bmp 704w, https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002388.bmp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"><figcaption><em>The party’s travels take them to the most interesting locations.</em></figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>During his quest, Justin encounters fascinating characters, both friend and foe. From quiet folk in sleepy villages to rambunctious youngsters eager for their own slice of adventure; from military platoons led by the most beautiful — but hopelessly shallow — lady sergeants to cunning merchants, towering warriors, alluring mermaids and ferocious dragons… Justin encounters them all, and for good or ill, manages to change the course of their lives in ways both subtle and grand.</p>

<figure><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="126" height="126" data-id="53358" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sue.png?resize=126%2C126&amp;ssl=1" alt=""></figure>



<figure><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="126" height="126" data-id="53359" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Feena.png?resize=126%2C126&amp;ssl=1" alt=""></figure>
</figure>



<p>Justin, Sue, and Feena are the first three playable characters in <em>Grandia</em>. Young Sue tries to keep Justin in line, while Feena searches for the true meaning of being an adventurer – with Justin slowly moving from admiring her to showing her the way.</p>



<p>The game is clever in pulling the player in for a ride that for a very long while feels very lighthearted and innocent. Even as Justin’s adventure begins in earnest and the player is exposed to antagonists, mysteries, undercurrents and intrigues, Justin can’t help but distill it back to the <strong>very pure essence of boyhood adventure.</strong> Mysterious tower causing problems for a nearby village for years? No problem, Justin will fix it! A dragon from a nearby volcano terrorizing the locals? Justin’s got this. A ghost ship sailing in to harass a passenger steamer? Justin is the answer, in the same way that, as youngsters, we all knew – we knew! – that <strong>WE were the heroes</strong>, and that WE would save the day, armed only with our courage and our grand imaginations. It was our duty, after all. We had it in us to go forth boldly, and change the world (and naturally, all before being called home for dinner).</p>



<p>This point is driven home by Justin’s insatiable desire to uncover the mystery of his Spirit Stone, and the ancient Angelou civilization. After an unfortunate but entirely predictable mishap in the local museum, followed by a mysterious revelation in the nearby Sult Ruins, Justin’s curiosity is ignited, and his drive for real adventure becomes indomitable. Meanwhile, forces are at work that care not for Justin’s explorations, and inevitably, the lad finds himself pitted against the Garlyle Forces and some of its top commanders. Their aims are complex and their operations span the world, and this scope creates a wonderful juxtaposition with Justin’s innocent demeanor and singular focus.</p>

<h2>On Screen!</h2>



<p>The Fifth Generation of consoles marked the rise of 3D graphics, but some genres made the leap easier than others. This shift was a struggle for RPGs, with many excellent titles continuing to employ 2D visuals, albeit in richer color and more sophisticated detail than seen in previous generations. Early attempts at the 3D RPG (<em>Virtual Hydlide</em>) highlighted how difficult it was to run this style of game on the hardware of the time without wrecking the framerate or keeping textures from looking like a checkerboard mess. Dungeon crawlers (<em>Shining the Holy Ark</em>) were among the first titles to get the 3D right, though the player’s scope of movement was very restricted. Finally, some fantasized that “3D” meant pre-rendered backgrounds and copious FMV clips, with the only real 3D being battle scenes. Ahem!</p>



<p><em>Grandia</em> took the traditional overhead RPG view and transformed the landscapes into <strong>fully realized 3D polygonal playfields</strong> that can be rotated and zoomed at will. Character and enemy sprites are then overlain on the 3D world to make the scenes come to life. The addition of the third dimension affords the use of depth in the environments: hills, cliffs, and valleys; minecar rails that ran higher or lower relative to other tracks, and so on. In this way, the player initially feels right at home with a view that looks comfortably familiar, but must quickly learn to constantly rotate the viewpoint to catch enemies in hiding, spy treasures only visible from certain angles, judge heights, and evaluate other geometric details to plot their best course forward.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="704" height="448" src="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002414.bmp" alt="" srcset="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002414.bmp 704w, https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002414.bmp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"><figcaption><em>Aside from technical achievements, the art direction is fantastic.</em></figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p><em>Grandia</em> wastes no time in getting gamers used to this new visual paradigm. One of the game’s first quests sees local frenemy Gantz challenge Justin and Sue to locate the three Legendary Treasures: the fabled helmet (Iron Pot), the storied shield (Pot Lid), and of course, the legendary (Wooden) Sword. The player must traverse all of Parm, climbing down river walkways, checking in enclosed spaces, and chasing down Gantz’s little brother to prove they are up to Gantz’ task — and in the process, get used to the game’s then-new control scheme.</p>



<p>The 3D is very well put together, both technical and artistically. The level of detail is truly phenomenal, from the tiniest objects and details, especially in the ‘in-town’ game sections. Justin is able to interact with some of the innocuous scenery — for example he can knock brooms over, disturb piles of plates, or bump into bells and chimes — just as any real, overly excited 14-year-old might clumsily do as they ran along. Animations, from little weathervanes rotating to laundry fluttering on a clothesline, to puffs of smoke coming up from fires or chimneys, all accentuate the feeling that these are real, living, bustling places. The level of detail, and all of it in 3D, is really special.</p>



<p>The coders at Game Arts made excellent use of the Saturn’s unique hardware when realizing <em>Grandia</em>’s locales. Where appropriate, textured infinite planes are used to draw floors, and they not only look good but also dramatically cut down on the usage of polygons in drawing the scene, leaving that much more in the processing budget to spend on other visual details. In later sections, those infinite planes take on a distortion effect to create some very cool-looking water flows — look for them initially in Parm’s pier, and later in places like the snowy Laine Village or the mysterious Castle of Dreams. The water shimmers as the player rotates their view to create a truly stunning effect.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="704" height="448" src="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002409-4.bmp" alt="" srcset="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002409-4.bmp 704w, https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002409-4.bmp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"><figcaption><em>Slimes are never that tough to dispatch in any RPG.</em></figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>The game’s characters and enemies are all represented by sprites that animate quite well and take viewpoints into account as the player rotates the camera. In yet more attention to detail, the sprites darken and then lighten again as the player moves in and out of shadowed areas — an impressive little detail that accentuates the visuals even further.</p>

<figure><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="124" height="126" data-id="53360" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Leen.png?resize=124%2C126&amp;ssl=1" alt=""></figure>
</figure>



<p>The trio of General Baal, Colonel Mullen, and Leen is introduced in the game’s opening scene, and all three are more than they appear.</p>



<p>The care that Game Arts took in crafting the visuals is commendable and <em>Grandia</em> comes off as one of the very best-looking 3D RPGs for the system, but Game Arts was perhaps a mite too ambitious. There are sections of the game where the framerate really chugs. Now, it must be acknowledged that low framerates were a hallmark of many 3D games in the 32-bit era, so some of this is to be expected, but the more detail Grandia is trying to show you, the more you will feel the Saturn huffing and puffing to get the job done. The game’s 3D framerate is not high at the best of times but it is passable, so it’s somewhat of a relief that the areas where it truly takes a dive aren’t too common.</p>



<h2>Pump up the Jam!</h2>



<p>Game Arts’ attention to detail extends to the sound department. For <em>Grandia</em>, Game Arts commissioned Skywalker Sound to handle the game’s sound effects. The result is <strong>positional sound</strong> — effects like running water, crackling fire, etc. will fade in and out as Justin and co. move closer in or further away from the source. Often, if the effect is important, it will also somewhat dampen the volume of the BGM as it plays out. Additionally, the effects will pan left or right depending on the source, and especially as the player rotates the camera. These effects may be subtle, but they are very well implemented and add to the game’s overall polish.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="704" height="448" src="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002421.bmp" alt="" srcset="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002421.bmp 704w, https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002421.bmp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"><figcaption><em>The game is very colorful.</em></figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>The game’s <strong>soundtrack was composed by Noriyuki Iwadare</strong> and is both varied and excellent. Iwadare’s use of instruments appropriate to the on-screen action is uncanny — for example, running around Parm we are treated to an industrial sounding theme, perfect for the town’s motif. The varied use of strings, drums and winds is frankly excellent and lends to the atmosphere, imitating the clang of metal and steel which so permeates the city. Equally impressive is that the music somehow manages to be exciting or somber or poignant without ever sounding overly (excuse the wordplay) grandiose. This keeps the soundtrack in line with the game’s more lighthearted narrative. Of course, where appropriate, the soundtrack does take on that epic quality. The desperate tones that play when the Garlyle forces appear contrast so well with the carefree, upbeat “Off Runs Sue” tune. Mullen’s theme is at once wistful and ambitious, and even the theme from the Sult Ruins dungeon is perfectly mood-setting. Multiple <em>Grandia </em>soundtracks have been released since the game’s debut and the soundtrack is universally praised.</p>

Mullen’s acolytes.</em></figcaption></figure>
</div>


<h2>How it Plays Out</h2>



<p><em>Grandia</em>’s gameplay, like so many RPGs before it, is split into two major gameplay slices: exposition-laden town sections and combat-focused dungeons.</p>



<p>Players will spend a fair bit of time in the ‘in-town’ sections of the game. Here, you will wander around, take in the scenery, interact with the NPCs of the area, and almost always, find a quest that must be completed. A quick word about the NPCs — there are quite a number of them in each town, and everyone has something interesting to say… and almost always, each NCP has at least two separate conversation sequences to offer, making for a truly large amount of story to soak in. And <strong>it’s all entirely optional!</strong> It’s completely possible to make one’s way through <em>Grandia</em> with only minimal NCP interaction, but the option to enhance the adventure with these extensive NPC interactions is always there, as each character will present a unique view or focused response.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="704" height="448" src="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002441.bmp" alt="" srcset="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002441.bmp 704w, https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002441.bmp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"><figcaption><em>An unlikely pairing.</em></figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>Predictably, the towns are filled with shops, though <em>Grandia</em> keeps things rather simple — there is but one general store which carries weapons, armor, accessories, and even magic all under the same roof. Buy, sell or trade up to the latest gear which gradually increases in the stat boosts it confers to your characters. Additionally, each town typically has one or more important locales, such as mayors’ offices or the chambers of village chiefs.</p>



<p>There is typically an inn or other house where the party can take rest, and at certain points in the game, resting triggers a shared meal scene that sees Justin break bread with his party mates. These meal scenes offer up critical dialogue, which the gamer can extend or keep short at their whim. When the critical conversation has been had, a bedtime icon will appear over Justin’s character sprite, and if the player is quite finished listening to the party chatter, they can select it to end the meal and get some rest. These mealtime conversations serve not only to flesh out what the party must tackle next, but also to offer a glimpse into the inner thoughts of the individual characters as they share their opinions, hopes and fears. Like so much in the game, <em>Grandia</em> implements this character exposition in a way that allows the player to decide how much of it to take in.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="704" height="448" src="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002480.bmp" alt="" srcset="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002480.bmp 704w, https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002480.bmp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"><figcaption><em>Great use of color.</em></figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p><strong>The visuals in the town sections really stand out.</strong> The Saturn manages to shift not only impressive amounts of polygons for the various structures, but also vivid and complex textures. This technical prowess is coupled with lush and imaginative art direction, resulting in each locale feeling complete and distinct. The dense, humid and green surrounds of Luc Village, nestled deep within the Misty Forest and inhabited by humanoid creatures contrasts sharply with the seaside port town of Dight with its cerulean waves gently rolling in onto its sandy shores. Milda’s hometown village of Laine is covered in snow, and the ancient Zil Padon is an architectural wonder with a central fountain in the middle of the Savanna desert. Game Arts very clearly discarded their standard world building cookie cutters, and their efforts shine through.</p>

</div>


<p>Once a locale has been explored, it will appear as a selectable destination on a gorgeous, hand-drawn high-resolution world map. Exiting an area often brings our party to this world map, and the next destination can be selected.</p>



<p>If the towns serve to heal the party, upgrade equipment, and advance the story, then the dungeons of the game offer treasure hunting, exploration, and of course, combat! Dungeons in <em>Grandia</em> range from literal underground labyrinths to above-ground forest mazes, to even large open plains that Justin et al. must traverse. Some of the more noteworthy settings include scaling a giant wall that keeps the world divided into two separate societies, negotiating the bowels of a ghost ship which appears out of nowhere to molest a transcontinental steamer, and even conquering the inside of an unstable volcano that’s inhabited by an ancient dragon.</p>



<p>Here, the player really must use their L and R buttons to shift the 3D landscape around, to find all the nooks of treasure or paths forward. Some areas feature set pieces that Justin and party can activate — for example, knocking over a loose pillar to bridge a gap. These are usually indicated by an exclamation point icon when the party nears the set piece.</p>


<div>

</div>


<p>All the while, treasure both great and small litters the landscape… but so do enemies! Enemies are visible in the dungeons and so can be avoided to an extent, but if Justin and party come in contact with an enemy, combat ensues.</p>



<h3><em>Grandia</em> Grinder Alert!<br>Grind for Experience Points Using Environmental Damage!</h3>



<p>Are YOU a <em>Grandia </em>grinder?? Some sections of the game will deal damage to Justin and party outside of combat. First noticed in the Dom Ruins, rock faces painted into some of the dungeon walls will cause mild HP damage by springing out and poking the party when the party doesn’t want to be poked! The player can then use heal magic and spam this process to quickly increase Water magic levels. Although definitely a grind, it’s much faster than earning those experience points via combat. A few other areas in the game present similar opportunities — such as the basement in the Castle of Dreams.</p>



<h2>A New Kind of Kombat</h2>



<p><em>Grandia</em> introduced an all-new combat system to the RPG genre, though it could be said to be a variant of other similar RPG battle systems. Essentially, all battle participants have icons that continuously move along a <strong>universal IP Gauge</strong>, until they reach the Command point. Here, the player will enter from a selection of commands which includes attacking, using an item or a spell, guarding, or even retreating. They then wait to reach the very end of the gauge to execute their selected action, and the more experienced the character, the faster that point is reached. <strong>A ton of strategy is introduced here</strong> as during this waiting period between selecting an action and executing it, they are vulnerable to both Cancels and Counterattacks from their opponents. Unlike many contemporary RPGs where the instinct is to simply unleash physical and magical attacks in a turn-based order, <strong>the player can take advantage of these waiting periods</strong> to cancel out incoming enemy attacks and push them back on their IP gauge. The system will take some getting used to, but can be used to devastating effect, especially in the more drawn-out boss battles. It is entirely possible to strategically get in a half-dozen actions by each character and prevent a boss from retaliating during the entire sequence, by carefully timing attacks. This makes combat a lot more involved and exciting.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="704" height="448" src="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002528.bmp" alt="" srcset="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002528.bmp 704w, https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002528.bmp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"><figcaption><em>Cancel culture? Counterculture? Grandia’s got it all.</em></figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>There are also advantages to catching an enemy unawares — player characters start much further ahead on their IP Gauge, with the reverse being true if Justin’s party is ambushed.</p>



<p>Players have a range of actions they can take when their IP Gauge is full, from the standard fare of using items, defending, running away, or even inspecting an enemy (is that slug-monster male or female, for example*).</p>

<p>Nana, Saki, and Mio are Mullen’s three she-sergeants. Serving as comedic relief, they are nevertheless quite capable opponents in battle.</p>



<h2>By Your Powers Combined… I Am Captain Planet!</h2>



<p>Earth. Fire. Wind. Water. These are the elemental forces that move the world, and most characters can master them! Learning magic in <em>Grandia</em> first requires that the party finds a <strong>Mana Egg</strong>. These rare items can then be exchanged in a shop for magic for a single character of your choice. That party member then learns the basics of your chosen magic element.</p>



<p>Inside of the four elements, magic spells are further split into levels, from one to three, to indicate their potency. Level 1 spells are your most basic spells and are what a character starts off with should they buy magic with their mana egg. Players that use magic in combat will gain skill points in that particular element, and those skill points are applied to all spells of that element, regardless of spell level — so, use a Level 1 Fire spell, and all levels of your Fire magic gain skill. Spell skill progression is represented by five red stars that fill up like a gauge, turning yellow as they gain experience. Greater experience shortens casting time (which, remember, is a vulnerable time as your spell can be cancelled by an opponent) and at higher levels, allows your character to learn combined element magic spells. All magic spells consume MP making them a limited resource, though a character’s overall MP capacity will grow with experience.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="704" height="448" src="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002917.bmp" alt="" srcset="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002917.bmp 704w, https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002917.bmp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"><figcaption><em>The snowy village of Laine. The water effects are <strong>chef’s kiss</strong>.</em></figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>Outside of magic, each character can also execute <strong>special attacks</strong> that are unique to them. These attacks are usually more devastating than standard attacks and sometimes require that the character is using a particular weapon class. These, too, gain skill points represented by five red stars that slowly build up to yellow, though special attacks consume SP (skill points). SP works much the same way as MP.</p>



<h3>Grandia Grinder Alert!<br>Rare Enemies Give High XP</h3>



<p>Typically, the game’s monsters do a good job of seeking you out, but there are occasional difficult-to-catch enemies to be found as well. Notice, for instance, the Chameleon enemies in the Virgin Forest. These green creatures are shy and are hard to catch and engage. But persist, and finish them off for a huge load of experience points — well worth a grinding sesh or three.</p>



<h2>Experience Required</h2>



<p><em>Grandia</em> has a complex (for the time) experience points system, which is cleverly segmented into several categories.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="704" height="448" src="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002507.bmp" alt="" srcset="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002507.bmp 704w, https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002507.bmp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"><figcaption><em>Level up!</em></figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>To start, each playable character has a set of basic stats that slowly increase as they gain experience. Hit Points (HP) are your standard measure of health and these increase at level-ups. SP are your skill points, which increase the speed and potency of your special attacks, as well as unlock new special attacks as you accumulate experience. Finally, the same is true of the more traditional magic points (MP), with the difference between SP and MP being that special attacks are individualized whereas magic attacks are more common amongst party members and can be bought in exchange for Mana Eggs.</p>



<p>As they adventure, Justin and company will occasionally find items that slightly <strong>boost a particular stat on a permanent basis.</strong> These items are rare indeed, but as with life, incremental gains tend to compound until the effects are undeniable.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="704" height="448" src="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002940.bmp" alt="" srcset="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002940.bmp 704w, https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002940.bmp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"><figcaption><em>The Seed of Speed grants a permanent stat boost.</em></figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>Most traditionally, defeating enemies grants experience points and accumulating the required amount grants characters a level-up, which slightly increases basic stats. Experience gained and gold / treasure collected is displayed on an after-battle screen. It is this type of XP that most contemporary RPGs concerned themselves with. <em>Grandia</em> ups the complexity a bit by introducing leveling for magic and skills, and further mixes things up by employing different weapon classes.</p>



<p>Justin and company are each capable of wielding a few different types of weapons, of which there are seven in total, ranging from swords to maces to staffs to bows. Each weapon class has its advantages and disadvantages, be it speed of use (from Command input to Execution on the IP gauge), to range, to overall damage dealt. As party members use their weapons, they gain experience in those weapon types, separately from their character experience.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="704" height="448" src="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002512.bmp" alt="" srcset="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002512.bmp 704w, https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002512.bmp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"><figcaption><em>The texture work is awesome throughout.</em></figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>In total, <em>Grandia</em> features basic character experience points which boosts common stats, magic experience which results in spells being cast faster and the learning of higher-level spells for various element types, skill experience for faster execution of special attacks, and weapon experience points which increase how well a character will handle that weapon type. Cleverly, these different experience categories are implemented in such a way as to make it entirely possible for gamers to completely ignore this aspect of the game should they so fancy. Because the system is automated, gamers can pay all of it little heed and still progress and have a great time with the game. Alternately, gamers can dive right into the finer points of the system to make those minor tweaks to get their characters to exactly the state they prefer.</p>

<h2>Go with the Flow</h2>



<p><em>Grandia</em> allows up to <strong>four playable characters</strong> to form Justin’s party at any one time. As the story progresses, some of the main characters will permanently step away from the adventure, for reasons practical and dramatic alike. One such parting in particular tugs at the heartstrings — it is nothing quite as dramatic as the year’s earlier death of Aeris (Aerith) from that big RPG on Sony’s lesser 32-bit machine, but it somehow feels more relatable, and more impactful. Players ought not be surprised by the need for tissues to manage an unexpected tear or two. And here, too, <em>Grandia</em> innovates: a portion of a departing playable character’s magic and weapon experience points are stored in the stashing place, to be retrieved and applied to whatever character you see fit. This strengthens their legacy in your party, as well as provide a practical reason not to neglect building up a character just because they may eventually leave the party. A nice touch.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="704" height="448" src="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002976.bmp" alt="" srcset="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002976.bmp 704w, https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002976.bmp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"><figcaption><em>At the foot of the End of the World.</em></figcaption></figure>
</div>


<h2>Is It Perfect?</h2>



<p>Grand as it sounds, the game isn’t without a few small flaws. Story-wise, players will be left wanting to know more about Justin’s father and how he came to be the keeper of his Spirit Stone. He is mentioned often in the early stages of the game, but as Justin’s adventure takes off, that arc never completes. Likewise for General Baal — we eventually learn his motivations, but not so much why he has become who he is today. A really well put together villain is one with whom we can empathise; someone whose circumstance we can understand. Both with Justin’s unnamed father and with Baal, there is a feeling that we are reading a book and that the answers lie just ahead, but despite some teasing, <em>Grandia</em> never lets us turn the page.</p>



<p>Technically, the game’s 3D is solid and varied, with plenty of minor details and meticulous textures, especially in the town sections. Blending VDP2-drawn planes with solid geometry and animated sprites means the world of <em>Grandia</em> is beautifully rendered, but that comes at the cost of an oft-stuttering framerate. The more of <em>Grandia</em>’s world we are allowed to see at once, the more the framerate suffers. Now, these were the formative years of 3D gaming, but at times, that framerate simply chugs, and it’s noticeable to the point of distraction. Thankfully, for most of the game, the framerate sits comfortably in the ‘acceptable’ space, but you won’t get through the game without feeling the Saturn sweat as it works to display all that <em>Grandia</em>’s artists wanted you to see.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="704" height="448" src="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002376.bmp" alt="" srcset="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002376.bmp 704w, https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002376.bmp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"><figcaption><em>Special Moves. These gain experience as well.</em></figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>Speaking of 3D, the game often requires the shifting of camera angles when exploring. When in long dungeons or any other large space, this can quickly become disorienting, and the player will lose their sense of direction. The game compensates somewhat for this with the addition of the compass, though its implementation is somewhat clumsy as rather than point north, it points to an exit or other objective. <strong>There is also lookout points called Dungeon Scopes</strong>, where the player is given a bird’s eye view of their current location from a default ‘north is up’ viewpoint. This helps orientating, but those lookout points are few and far between and using them tends to break up the game’s flow. Players may well find themselves keeping their camera shifting to a minimum as a result.</p>



<p>Lastly, a technical note: <em>Grandia</em> sure gives the Saturn’s laser a workout, and there are some clever pre-loading techniques implemented to keep the game flowing as smoothly as possible. The cost here is that <em>Grandia</em> is very sensitive to disc quality. Those that have burnt their English-patched game onto CDs and are playing on real Saturn hardware may well find the game freeze, especially in battle when calling various spells. This is VERY annoying, especially as dungeon save points are sparse, and it is not uncommon to be in the heat of a battle only to have everyone freeze with the reset button being the only escape. This is remedied by using an ODE solution that omits discs entirely, but the game’s sensitivity to the quality of your CD-R burn needs to be called out.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="704" height="448" src="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002964.bmp" alt="" srcset="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002964.bmp 704w, https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002964.bmp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"><figcaption><em>Hell yeah!

</div>


<h2>Final Word</h2>



<p><strong><em>Grandia </em>is great.</strong> The visuals are gorgeous, the music is appropriately evocative, the combat is frenetically strategic, and the story is well paced. Tough battles and surprise plot twists await intrepid gamers, and sub-plots occasionally weave their way into the adventure, too — especially in sections where we briefly leave Justin. On occasion, players will follow Colonel Mullen with Feena, explore the mysterious past of Mullen’s attaché Leen, or even soak in the comedic antics of the three beautiful Garlyle generals Mio, Nana, and Saki.</p>



<p>Ultimately, <em>Grandia</em> a delight to play. A total joy… but one that demands an <strong>intense time commitment</strong>. A player Justin’s age surely has the time, but what about those of us that are well into adulting? Some sections of the game, especially the longer dungeons, have few opportunities to save one’s game. In that sense, the game is a total hardcore, traditional JRPG. It is not easily digested in small play sessions, so playing <em>Grandia </em>is committing a huge slice of one’s discretionary time budget.</p>



<p>And yet, perhaps paradoxically, playing <em>Grandia</em> has a way of making one feel young again. <em>Grandia</em> is grand in the same way we ourselves felt grand as youngsters — that, armed with a stick we’ve just picked up and nothing more than our imagination, our wits, and our indomitable spirit, we could go forth boldly and change the world. That’s the beauty of a main character like Justin — he is not yet jaded; he has not yet borne the <strong>burden of grown-up problems on his shoulders</strong>. In many ways, we were all Justin (or Sue!) at one point, and the game shines a light on that part of us that is now long behind (most of) us. Perhaps the most memorable aspect of <em>Grandia</em> is that it allows us, for a moment all too brief, to once again be that young boy or girl full of optimism and energy, and in today’s complex and stressful world, that feels simply wonderful.</p>

<div>
<h2>Three Optional Dungeons</h2>



<p><em>Grandia</em> is generally a well-balanced affair, with experience accumulating at the right rate for players to progress in the game. That said, the world of <em>Grandia</em> plays host to three completely optional dungeons meant solely for increasing character abilities and experience — and goes so far as to explicitly point out that these areas are not part of the game’s story and are entirely optional.</p>



<p>The first such dungeon can be found just west of the first section of the Zil Desert. It’s a large, very dark brown multi-leveled maze with the only save point being at the entrance. The enemies are tougher than one would expect at this point in the game, but nothing is impossible for Justin et al. The key here is to find the four Soldier’s Souls, which grants access to the treasures of the dungeon, at the very end, past the boss. The boss is a remix of a previous boss from Feena’s failed wedding to Pakon and packs quite a punch. The main prize here is the excellent Godspeed Knife, which adds a huge ACT boost, to massively speed up the user’s IP gauge.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="704" height="448" src="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002930.bmp" alt="" srcset="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002930.bmp 704w, https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002930.bmp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"><figcaption><em>The Soldier’s Graveyard entrance.</em></figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>The second optional dungeon is also found to the west but is accessible from the second part of the Zil Desert. This dungeon is very small but has perhaps the most charm. Justin and company are greeted by a mysterious Lady at the castle entrance, begging for help but also warning of a curse on the castle. Once inside, there are several rooms to visit and loot to collect. Really simplistic and set to lure the player to lower their guard, just in time to battle the formidable Lord’s Ghost boss. This guy’s TOUGH, with strong multi-character attacks and cancelling moves. Take him down to claim the awesome Lightning Sword, which gives a 50 ATK boost and, as an elemental sword, has the Zap! spell built in.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="704" height="448" src="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002936.bmp" alt="" srcset="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002936.bmp 704w, https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002936.bmp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"><figcaption><em>Don’t thank us yet…</em></figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>The final optional dungeon is the mother of all dungeons in<em> Grandia</em>. Found tucked away in the Savanna Wilderness and accessible via a secret passage, the Tower of Temptation consists of an outside area and 12 (!) floors of punishing combat. Of course, the only save point is at the very start of the outside area, though Justin can activate a couple of shortcuts through the tower as he makes progress, so that backtracking to heal and save is a bit easier. Interestingly, the starting area is surrounded by six Zero Weapons – one of each kind of weapons that grants a 0 ATK value — ideal for training weapons on weaker enemies, as these will do nearly no damage.</p>



<p><strong><em>Grandia</em> Grinder Mini-Alert</strong>: many enemies in the Tower drop stat-increasing items, making this an ideal place to pull it all out and go for that growth.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="704" height="448" src="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002973.bmp" alt="" srcset="https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002973.bmp 704w, https://www.segasaturnshiro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/00002973.bmp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px"><figcaption><em>Prepare to spend hours on this dungeon.</em></figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>Each floor of the Tower features maze sections, hidden doors, powerful enemies, and of course, switches to hit. Simply by making one’s way through the tower will increase the party’s levels, as there is so much battling to do. It is not uncommon to spend hours in the Tower, so it’s a welcome fact that the Tower is entirely optional. The final three floors are all boss — yes, there are three bosses to fight in a row. No saving, no healing. The final of the three bosses is tough as nails, but the reward is well worth it — NINE amazing items to pick up, including two items from the Grinder’s Gear™ premium collection: the Astral Miracle and the Ethereal Miracle, both accessories that double weapon or magic experience gained. VERY useful, but they better be, considering the pain just endured to complete the Tower of Temptation!</p>
</div>



<h2>The Universe is Grand…ia</h2>



<p><em>Grandia</em> went on to <strong>sell bucket-loads in Japan</strong>, especially during release week. It received a Digital Museum DLC-style disc, got a port on the mass-market PlayStation including a PS Greatest Hits re-release, and finally, a PlayStation English localization in 1999. The series continued in 2000 with the excellent <em>Grandia 2</em> on Dreamcast, which itself was later poorly ported to Sony’s killer of dreams, the PlayStation 2. That system would also see the less-well received <em>Grandia 3</em>, which would spell the end of the main series’ run. The series also saw several spin-off games such as <em>Grandia Xtreme</em> and <em>Grandia Online</em>. Additionally, the first <em>Grandia</em> was recently remade for modern consoles with the release of the <em>Grandia HD Collection</em>.</p>



<p>*Note: you cannot inspect monsters’ genders in battle. That was just a joke. Also there is no Grinder’s Gear in Grandia. </p>

</div>


<p>A bit of a personal story… The above screenshot is my favorite scene in all of Grandia. See, the game does a brilliant job of bringing us back to the days of youthful adventures where nothing at all was impossible, and despite whatever danger beset us, we knew deep down that in the end, we would be all right. But in the most subtle of ways, Grandia also covers personal growth and the passage of time. </p>



<p>At some point, deep into the adventure, 8-year-old Sue gets tired. At first, she temporarily leaves the party whilst recuperating at a local sick house, with everyone hoping (and the player confidently knowing) that she will get better. But… she doesn’t. She puts on a brave face and re-joins the party, going on one final quest. As the gamer, I kept looking for the herb or special item that I could find to cure her, but no such moment ever came. There never was any single wound or ailment that Sue suffered, it’s just that one day, she simply… got tired, and ultimately, had to leave the party. She was a trooper through the entire adventure; completely indispensable she was, but there was a sunset to her time on the grand adventure, and she ended up leaving far too soon for my liking.</p>



<p>In real life, this sometimes happens, too. People in our orbit — strong, vibrant people, whom we believe will be with us forever — sometimes, unexpectedly, undeservedly… get tired, and have to quit the great adventure. Sometimes they are even younger than us, or in better health than us, or benefitting from any number of other factors that make their leaving seem senseless and cruelly unfair. It’s a reminder of the finite nature of life, and that sometimes we are living oh so naively and innocently through what we will later call the best times of our lives.</p>



<p>Sometimes, we get a chance to say our goodbyes before they depart us, and this is something Justin and Feena were able to share with Sue. With tears in her eyes, even as she bade farewell, she wished for Justin to follow his dreams and complete his long quest to find Angelou. It’s this that ties all of these sentiments together, for me. We all get older. We all leave our childhood behind us and begin to lead our adult lives in earnest. Our carefree days of questing and playing our days away, confident that in the end, everything will be all right, are replaced by planning, worrying, pressure, stress, failure, and other harsh realities of life. Here, Sue reminds us of the importance of not forgetting our dreams. We may not have the time or the energy that we did then, but whatever the obstacles, we must always go boldly in the direction of our dreams, hand-in-hand with those who love us, for we, too, will one day exit the adventure. In our final moments, what sweeter satisfaction could there be than to warmly smile at those who walked with us, and to look back on our journey with pride.   </p>	</div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>It has now been 30 years since WarCraft II: Tides of Darkness was released. After the great response to Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, released in November 1994, Blizzard began working on Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness. Development stared in the first months of 1995, and the game was released in North America and Australia on December 9, 1995.</p>
<p>While WarCraft: Orcs and Humans had laid the foundations of the series — arguably even for the RTS genre at a whole — it was really WarCraft II that took things to new heights. More units could be selected at once, the player could right-click to issue commands, naval and aerial combat was introduced, and buildings and units could be upgraded. The graphics were more vivid and visually appealing, and features like the Fog of War was introduced, where you could only see in the vicinity of your own units — unlike in the first game, where you could indefinitely see any area you had previously visited, you now had to continuously scout the map.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.jorsys.org/archive/december_2025-files/war2tod.jpg" alt="WarCraft II: Tides of Darkness"></p><p>Many things still resembled the first game. The two factions — the Humans and the Orcs — were balanced through their similarites. For every unit and building of one faction, the other had one that was functionally equivalent, and so the sides largely mirrored each other. The only real differences lay in the spells available to their higher-level units. In that regard, the clear winners were the Orcs, who had a tremendous advantage thanks to the incredibly powerful and unbalanced Bloodlust spell of the Ogre-Magi.</p>
<p>It is quite impressive that Blizzard managed to release a title of such quality in such a short span of time, especially considering that the overall design and gameplay evolved during development. Originally, Blizzard’s concept blended modern and fantasy elements, such as fighter pilots being ambushed by a fire-breathing dragon. In the Alpha version (it is still probably floating around somewhere on the Internet) which was given to magazines for review shortly before the game's release, players could, for example, mine rocks which acted as an additional required resource.</p>
<p>Several versions and bundles of WarCraft II were released over the years:</p>
<ul>
<li>WarCraft II: Tides of Darkness, originally written for DOS, though it had a Windows launch screen and ran well under Windows 95. A Macintosh version was also released. The DOS version supported multiplayer games via null modem cable, modem, or IPX, while Mac players could also play via TCP/IP or AppleTalk.</li>
<li>WarCraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal, the expansion, released in April 1996.</li>
<li>WarCraft: Battle Chest, released in 1996, was a bundle which included WarCraft: Orcs and Humans, WarCraft II: Tides of Darkness, and WarCraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal.</li>
<li>WarCraft II: The Dark Saga, released in 1997, was a port for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation consoles by Electronic Arts, including the campaigns from both Tides of Darkness and Beyond the Dark Portal.</li>
<li>WarCraft II: Battle.net Edition, released in 1999, ported the game's code to Microsoft Windows, fixed some minor bugs, and enabled multiplayer support via Blizzard's online service, Battle.net.</li>
<li>WarCraft II Battle Chest, released in 1999, included the Battle.net Edition and its official strategy guide.</li>
<li>WarCraft II: Remastered, released in November 2024, is modern remaster of Tides of Darkness and Beyond the Dark Portal, with improved graphics and updated controls.</li>
</ul>
<p>WarCraft II: Tides of Darkness received enthusiastic reviews, elevating Blizzard to the top ranks alongside Westwood Studios, id Software, and LucasArts. The rivalry between Blizzard's series and Westwood Studios' Command and Conquer series helped fuel the RTS boom of the late 1990s. PC Gamer US named WarCraft II the best game of 1995, calling it an "easy" choice and writing that "Warcraft II stand[s] out — way out — as the most impressive, most entertaining, game of 1995". The editors also awarded it Best Multi-Player Game of 1995.</p>
<p>WarCraft II was notable for the large number of third-party utilities created for it. Quickly, <span>Daniel Lemberg</span> reverse-engineered and published the map file (*.pud) format and wrote the first third-party map editor, <span>War2xEd</span>, which could do multiple things that the bundled map editor could not, such as editing unit attributes. Blizzard apparently began using <span>War2xEd</span> internally, and it influenced their decision to later ship a feature-rich map editor with StarCraft.</p>
<p>Next, <span>Alexander Cech</span> and <span>Daniel Lemberg</span> reverse-engineered the game data format, the WAR archives. <span>Alexander Cech</span> went on to make a hugely important tool called <span>Wardraft</span>, which allowed users to browse and modify the contents of the WAR archives. This enabled extensive game modifications, known as "Total Conversions". Many such projects gained popularity and remained in development for a long time, notable examples being <span>DeathCraft: Twilight of Demons</span>, <span>War of the Ring</span>, <span>Editor's Total Conversion</span>, <span>Funcraft</span> and <span>Rituals of Rebirth</span>.</p>
<p>Most of these utilities and conversions have long since faded into obscurity, but their legacy lives on. They impacted Blizzard's decision to bundle ever more powerful editors and trigger systems into StarCraft and later WarCraft III, which in turn later spawned entire games such as Dota (which began as a WarCraft III map). Hopefully, someday (soon?) we can host some of the Total Conversions here at <span>Jorvik Systems</span>.</p>
<hr>
<p>As a personal anecdote, I vividly remember two defining moments related to the game. I was young when it came out, and my dad's friend had pirated it; somehow the game ended up on our computer. I was too young to speak English at the time, and the interface was confusing to me, so a relative helped me understand the basics — how to make peons construct buildings, how to control units, and how to navigate around the map. I hadn't played computer games much before then, but from that moment on, I was arguably obsessed.</p>
<p>A second strong memory came a few months later, at my friend <span>Erik</span>'s house, on his Intel 486 PC. He was experimenting with the WarCraft II map editor, which I hadn't known existed, and I was blown away. I simply could not believe that Blizzard would ship such a tool with the game; to me, it meant that people could essentially create their own games by designing entirely new scenarios. It is quite possible that my fascination with modding was born in that very moment. We probably went outside to play shortly afterward, which I found incredibly lame — we had at our disposal the most powerful tool I could imagine, so why were we not inside using it?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
        
<p>So after all these hours talking about AI, in these last five minutes I am going to talk about: horses.</p>
<p><img src="https://andyljones.com/source/horses/horse_efficiency.png" alt="Engine efficiency over time, showing steady improvement"></p>
<p>Engines, steam engines, were invented in 1700.</p>
<p>And what followed was 200 years of steady improvement, with engines getting 20% better a decade.</p>
<p>For the first 120 years of that steady improvement, horses didn't notice at all.</p>
<p>Then, between 1930 and 1950, 90% of the horses in the US disappeared.</p>
<p>Progress in engines was steady. Equivalence to horses was sudden.</p>
<hr>

<p>But enough about horses. Let's talk about chess!</p>
<p><img src="https://andyljones.com/source/horses/chess.png" alt="Computer chess Elo over time, showing steady 50 point per year improvement"></p>
<p>Folks started tracking computer chess in 1985.</p>
<p>And for the next 40 years, computer chess would improve by 50 Elo per year.</p>
<p>That meant in 2000, a human grandmaster could expect to win 90% of their games against a computer.</p>
<p>But ten years later, the same human grandmaster would lose 90% of their games against a computer.</p>
<p>Progress in chess was steady. Equivalence to humans was sudden.</p>
<hr>

<p>Enough about chess! Let's talk about AI.</p>
<p><img src="https://andyljones.com/source/horses/project_cost.png" alt="AI datacenter capital expenditure over time"></p>
<p>Capital expenditure on AI has been pretty steady.</p>
<p>Right now we're - globally - spending the equivalent of 2% of US GDP on AI datacenters each year.</p>
<p>That number seems to have steadily been doubling over the past few years.</p>
<p>And it seems - according to the deals signed - likely to carry on doubling for the next few years.</p>
<hr>

<p>But from my perspective, from equivalence to me, it hasn't been steady at all.</p>
<p><img src="https://andyljones.com/source/horses/ask_claude.png" alt="Questions answered by humans vs Claude over time"></p>
<p>I was one of the first researchers hired at Anthropic.</p>
<p>This pink line, back in 2024, was a large part of my job. Answer technical questions for new hires.</p>
<p>Back then, me and other old-timers were answering about 4,000 new-hire questions a month.</p>
<p>Then in December, Claude finally got good enough to answer some of those questions for us.</p>
<p>In December, it was some of those questions. Six months later, 80% of the questions I'd been being asked had disappeared.</p>
<p>Claude, meanwhile, was now answering 30,000 questions a month; eight times as many questions as me &amp; mine ever did.</p>
<hr>

<p>Now. Answering those questions was only part of my job.</p>
<p>But while it took horses decades to be overcome, and chess masters years, it took me all of six months to be surpassed.</p>
<p><img src="https://andyljones.com/source/horses/per_token_cost.png" alt="Cost per million words: AI researcher vs subsistence farmer vs Sonnet"></p>
<p>Surpassed by a system that costs one thousand times less than I do.</p>
<p>A system that costs less, per word thought or written, than it'd cost to hire the cheapest human labor on the face of the planet.</p>
<hr>

<p>And so I find myself thinking a lot about horses, nowadays.</p>
<p><img src="https://andyljones.com/source/horses/horse_car.png" alt="Horses vs cars in the United States, with 'me' marked at 1920"></p>
<p>In 1920, there were 25 million horses in the United States, 25 million horses totally ambivalent to two hundred years of progress in mechanical engines.</p>
<p>And not very long after, 93 per cent of those horses had disappeared.</p>
<p>I very much hope we'll get the two decades that horses did.</p>
<p>But looking at how fast Claude is automating my job, I think we're getting a lot less.</p>
<hr>

<p><em>All opinions are my own and not those of my employer.</em></p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>We show that deep neural networks trained across diverse tasks exhibit remarkably similar low-dimensional parametric subspaces. We provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that demonstrates that neural networks systematically converge to shared spectral subspaces regardless of initialization, task, or domain. Through mode-wise spectral analysis of over 1100 models - including 500 Mistral-7B LoRAs, 500 Vision Transformers, and 50 LLaMA-8B models - we identify universal subspaces capturing majority variance in just a few principal directions. By applying spectral decomposition techniques to the weight matrices of various architectures trained on a wide range of tasks and datasets, we identify sparse, joint subspaces that are consistently exploited, within shared architectures across diverse tasks and datasets. Our findings offer new insights into the intrinsic organization of information within deep networks and raise important questions about the possibility of discovering these universal subspaces without the need for extensive data and computational resources. Furthermore, this inherent structure has significant implications for model reusability, multi-task learning, model merging, and the development of training and inference-efficient algorithms, potentially reducing the carbon footprint of large-scale neural models.

<p>Space (whitespace) is&nbsp;a&nbsp;whole group of&nbsp;glyphs, one of&nbsp;the most important and frequently-used. Any computer user knows space as&nbsp;the widest key on&nbsp;their keyboard, however the notion itself is&nbsp;much bigger and comprises multiple important typographic terms and ideas.</p>

<p>Space in&nbsp;general is&nbsp;a&nbsp;blank unprinted area, a&nbsp;counterform that separates letters, words, lines etc. In&nbsp;typography, there are several types of&nbsp;spaces: sinkage (space on&nbsp;a&nbsp;page above a&nbsp;textblock), indent (space before the paragraph), leading (vertical space), word spacing, and letter spacing. In&nbsp;this article, we&nbsp;will primarily focus on&nbsp;word spacing, i.e. the space as&nbsp;a&nbsp;glyph.</p>

<p>European languages did not use word spacing for a&nbsp;long time, it&nbsp;was not until the 7th century that word spacing entered Latin script. In&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;metal type, the space was a&nbsp;material, tangible object — a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;metal that left no&nbsp;print. In&nbsp;the pre-digital era, most text blocks were justified, which required several spaces of&nbsp;different width. Those types of&nbsp;spacing were defined by&nbsp;the notion of&nbsp;<em>em</em>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<em>point size</em>), which is <a href="">height of&nbsp;the piece of&nbsp;metal

For example, one em&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;12-point typeface is&nbsp;12&nbsp;points, whereas its en&nbsp;(half-em) spaces’ width is&nbsp;6pt, third space (of&nbsp;an&nbsp;em) equals 4pt, and so&nbsp;on.</p>

<p>These types of&nbsp;spaces are still existent in&nbsp;the digital age, but they are mostly used by&nbsp;advanced typographers. Messengers, text editors, and other programs and applications most typically use only regular space.</p>



<h2 id="word-space">Word space</h2>

<p>Standard space, word space, space <em>per se,</em> is&nbsp;the symbol typed using the widest key on&nbsp;the keyboard.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;metal type, the size of&nbsp;standard space varied depending on&nbsp;the typographic tradition, in&nbsp;most cases the space was rather wide.</p>

<p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;standard word space, metal composition used an&nbsp;en&nbsp;space, half the height of&nbsp;the point size, or&nbsp;em-square (in&nbsp;Cyrillic typography), while Latin space was equal to&nbsp;the third of&nbsp;the em&nbsp;space.

<a href="https://yadi.sk/i/oy19NzNjydZjR" target="_blank">Living Typography (2012)</a></p>

<p>In&nbsp;the early digitised fonts one often sees excessively wide spaces; probably, it&nbsp;was an&nbsp;attempt to&nbsp;imitate en&nbsp;space, or&nbsp;three-per-em space, which were used as&nbsp;the main spacing material in&nbsp;metal type. Such a&nbsp;space width can affect the typesetting rhythm and would seem redundant in&nbsp;modern typography.</p>

<p>Wide spacing is&nbsp;both physiologically unnecessary and makes the whole typeset structure reticulate, aesthetically ruining the page’s layout. If&nbsp;for some reason you can’t stick to&nbsp;en&nbsp;space size in&nbsp;this particular line, it’s better to&nbsp;scale down spacing using three-per-em spaces (that equal to&nbsp;the third of&nbsp;an&nbsp;em), or&nbsp;spaces of&nbsp;3, or&nbsp;even 2&nbsp;points.

<p><em>A wide word spacing seems weird to&nbsp;an&nbsp;eye of&nbsp;the modern reader, and it&nbsp;is&nbsp;way too visible in&nbsp;texts</em></p>



<p>Today, word space width is&nbsp;specified by&nbsp;the typeface’s designer themselves, and it&nbsp;is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the defining moments in&nbsp;designing a&nbsp;typeface, along with spacing, — texture and rhythm of&nbsp;the typeset are heavily dependent on&nbsp;word space width.</p>

<p>Many modern typographers are seeking to&nbsp;subject the space width to&nbsp;certain rules. For example, some type designers claim that the space should be&nbsp;equal to&nbsp;the bounding box of&nbsp;lowercase letter&nbsp;<strong>i</strong>. However, this rule can’t be&nbsp;universal: specifically, it&nbsp;definitely won’t work for typefaces where letter <strong>i</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;of&nbsp;unconventional design and proportions. In&nbsp;super large point sizes, spacing and word spaces are often intentionally reduced, as&nbsp;in&nbsp;such cases even the bounding box of&nbsp;the <strong>i&nbsp;</strong>can be&nbsp;too wide.</p>

<p>It&nbsp;used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;rule of&nbsp;thumb for headline settings to&nbsp;leave a&nbsp;space between words that is&nbsp;just wide enough to&nbsp;fit in&nbsp;a&nbsp;lowercase&nbsp;<strong>i</strong>. For comfortable reading of&nbsp;long lines, the space between words should be&nbsp;much wider.

<p>Depending on&nbsp;whether your typeface is&nbsp;serif or&nbsp;sans serif, it&nbsp;makes sense to&nbsp;take, or&nbsp;not to&nbsp;take, in&nbsp;consideration sidebearings of&nbsp;the glyph. It&nbsp;can be&nbsp;very different depending on&nbsp;style, too: with wide and light weights, there will be&nbsp;more unprinted area than with narrow and heavy weights, and this also applies to&nbsp;the space width.</p>

<p>There is&nbsp;no&nbsp;question but that wordspaces may not be&nbsp;too large, or&nbsp;that the line must appear to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an&nbsp;even, well-balanced whole. What applies to&nbsp;letterspaces also applies to&nbsp;wordspaces: they too are a&nbsp;function of&nbsp;the counters of&nbsp;the individual letters: the smaller these are, the smaller the wordspaces; the larger the counters, the larger the wordspaces.

<p>Blank space between words should be&nbsp;such as&nbsp;to&nbsp;ensure that words are visibly separated from each other — if&nbsp;spacing is&nbsp;wider, there will be&nbsp;holes between words, if&nbsp;smaller, it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;difficult to&nbsp;tell one word from another. You can’t measure space with a&nbsp;ruler, as&nbsp;everything depends on&nbsp;specific design or&nbsp;typeface.</p>

<p>Using double spaces is&nbsp;a&nbsp;technique inherited from the age of&nbsp;typewriters. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;strongly advisable to&nbsp;check a&nbsp;document for double spaces and replace those by&nbsp;single spaces.</p>

<p>Some of&nbsp;the recommendations learned by&nbsp;the educated typist are still now acquired habits wrongly used in&nbsp;digital documents; for instance, the use of&nbsp;three spaces after a&nbsp;period or&nbsp;two after the comma. There was just one space width available in&nbsp;the typewriter, so&nbsp;words and sentences were separated by&nbsp;the same distance. The double space was used to&nbsp;differentiate sentences and improve the readability of&nbsp;the text.

<p>Additional spacing after a&nbsp;period is&nbsp;a&nbsp;questionable method in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;readability. It&nbsp;can be&nbsp;assumed that in&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;typewriters additional space could have better separated sentences from one another in&nbsp;the context of&nbsp;monowidth typeface, yet monowidth period and space already form a&nbsp;larger gap than any space within the sentence. Since typewriters, typesetting tools have significantly improved over time, and today nobody will typeset in&nbsp;a&nbsp;monowidth typeface, unless it&nbsp;is&nbsp;absolutely necessary. So, currently, the use of&nbsp;double spaces is&nbsp;considered mauvais ton, i.e. bad manners, regardless of&nbsp;typeface.</p>

<p>American lawyer Matthew Butterick wrote a&nbsp;book on&nbsp;typography for lawyers, writers, and anyone who works with text. In&nbsp;the&nbsp;US, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;still very common among the older generation to&nbsp;use double spaces, so&nbsp;Matthew dedicated two entire chapters of&nbsp;his Practical Typography to&nbsp;this issue. Butterick tried to&nbsp;convince his audience by&nbsp;imaginary dialogues:</p>

<p>“If&nbsp;you approve of&nbsp;smaller word spaces in&nbsp;some situations, why do&nbsp;you insist on&nbsp;only one space between sentences, where a&nbsp;larger gap might be&nbsp;useful?” Because you’re already getting a&nbsp;larger gap. A&nbsp;sentence-ending word space typically appears next to&nbsp;a&nbsp;period. A&nbsp;period is&nbsp;mostly white space. So&nbsp;visually, the space at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sentence already appears larger than a&nbsp;single word space. No&nbsp;need to&nbsp;add another.

<h2 id="non-breaking-space">Non-breaking Space</h2>

<p>Non-breaking space is&nbsp;a&nbsp;space character that prevents an&nbsp;automatic line break at&nbsp;its position. For instance, in&nbsp;Russian and a&nbsp;number of&nbsp;other Central and Eastern European languages, non-breaking space serves to&nbsp;stick together a&nbsp;preposition and a&nbsp;word next to&nbsp;it, numbers and units of&nbsp;measurements, name and surname, etc.</p>

<p>Non-breaking space is&nbsp;supported by&nbsp;almost any text editing program, graphic design software, or&nbsp;browser, along with a&nbsp;standard space, so&nbsp;one shouldn’t forget to&nbsp;utilise it&nbsp;according to&nbsp;the typesetting rules of&nbsp;any given language.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;Russian language, non-breaking space shall connect the dash and its previous word (except for direct speech), prepositions with following words, initials with surname, abbreviations (such as&nbsp;i.e.), numero sign with numbers, numbers and units of&nbsp;measurements.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;English it&nbsp;is&nbsp;considered good manners to&nbsp;stick together not prepositions, but pronouns and articles with the following word. However, this rule is&nbsp;often neglected, especially when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;newspapers and magazines.</p>

<p>Professional typesetting software have spaces of&nbsp;non-standard widths. In&nbsp;InDesign, all additional spaces — em&nbsp;space, en&nbsp;space, thin space, etc. — are non-breaking.</p>



<h2 id="additional-spaces">Additional spaces</h2>

<p>Standard space is&nbsp;used everywhere; it&nbsp;is&nbsp;supported by&nbsp;any word, text, or&nbsp;code processing app. Non-breaking space is&nbsp;supported almost anywhere as&nbsp;well. However, computer typesetting still possesses a&nbsp;number of&nbsp;spaces dating back to&nbsp;metal type, allowing for finer adjustment of&nbsp;white space if&nbsp;necessary.</p>

<p>If&nbsp;a&nbsp;font supports additional spaces, those can be fetched via&nbsp;glyphs palette or&nbsp;using clipboard. Most graphic software do&nbsp;not support those spaces; for example, Adobe Illustrator 2020 includes only four additional spaces: em&nbsp;space, en&nbsp;space, thin space, and hair space.</p>

<p>And there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;reason for that: neither Illustrator, nor Photoshop were designed for advanced typesetting and laying out books. However, in&nbsp;InDesign you can easily set any kind of&nbsp;space, and a&nbsp;skilled typographer will use those.</p>



<h2 id="emspace">Em&nbsp;Space</h2>

<p>A&nbsp;space equal to&nbsp;the height of&nbsp;the em&nbsp;square (point size.) In&nbsp;early serifs, the metal face of&nbsp;the capital&nbsp;<strong>М</strong> tended to&nbsp;be&nbsp;square — probably, thus the English name. Metal type often used em&nbsp;space as paragraph indent.</p>



<h2 id="enspace">En&nbsp;Space</h2>

<p>Half of&nbsp;the width of&nbsp;an&nbsp;em. Russian-language metal type composition considered it&nbsp;the main type of&nbsp;space, even though in&nbsp;word spacing, especially if&nbsp;the text is&nbsp;aligned to&nbsp;the left or&nbsp;right, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;excessively wide.</p>



<h2 id="three-per-em-space-third-space">Three-per-em Space, Third Space</h2>

<p>One&nbsp;third of&nbsp;an&nbsp;em&nbsp;space. Historically considered as&nbsp;the main space in&nbsp;Western European typography.</p>

<p>The first obligation of&nbsp;a&nbsp;good typesetter is&nbsp;to&nbsp;achieve a&nbsp;compact line image, something best accomplished by&nbsp;using three-to-em or&nbsp;three-space word spacing. In&nbsp;former times even roman was set much tighter than we&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;today; the specimen sheet that contains the original of&nbsp;Garamond’s roman of&nbsp;1592, printed in&nbsp;14-point, shows a&nbsp;word spacing in&nbsp;all lines of&nbsp;2&nbsp;points only, which is&nbsp;one-seventh of&nbsp;an&nbsp;em! This means that we&nbsp;cannot call three-to-em word spacing particularly tight.

<h2 id="quarter-space">Quarter Space</h2>

<p>One fourth of&nbsp;an&nbsp;em&nbsp;space. Some authors believe quarter space to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the primary word space.</p>

<p>For a&nbsp;normal text face in&nbsp;a&nbsp;normal text size, a&nbsp;typical value for the word space is&nbsp;a&nbsp;quarter of&nbsp;an&nbsp;em, which can be&nbsp;written M/4. (A&nbsp;quarter of&nbsp;an&nbsp;em&nbsp;is&nbsp;typically about the same&nbsp;as, or&nbsp;slightly more than, the set-width of&nbsp;the letter&nbsp;t.)

<h2 id="thin-space">Thin Space</h2>

<p>⅕ of&nbsp;an&nbsp;em&nbsp;space. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;common that thin space equals about half the standard one, which is&nbsp;why thin space is&nbsp;used where standard word space would be&nbsp;too wide. For example, thin space is&nbsp;often utilised for spacing a&nbsp;dash in&nbsp;cases where standard space is&nbsp;too wide. Thin space is&nbsp;also used for spacing initials, from each other and from the surname:</p>



<p><img src="https://cdn-gc.type.today/storage/post_image/4/9/4940/image-SO7pERcEMDmGd2OHkjQ4CnsLs1Y3edduEw.jpg" alt="6"><em>Standard space in&nbsp;<a href="https://type.today/en/spectral" target="_blank">Spectral</a> is&nbsp;too wide to&nbsp;be&nbsp;used for spacing initials and dashes</em>
<img src="https://cdn-gc.type.today/storage/post_image/4/9/4941/image-O4eNbawExg11Uyp03oXkekBsZyEgHfZJGw.jpg" alt="7"><em>Thin spaces look more neat, better connecting initials with a&nbsp;surname and two parts of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sentence with each other</em></p>



<p>French typographic tradition prescribes the use of&nbsp;either thin or&nbsp;hair spaces to&nbsp;space any two-part symbols: exclamation mark, question mark, semicolon, etc.</p>

<p>Regardless of&nbsp;the language, such glyphs as&nbsp;question mark and exclamation mark typically are very visible in&nbsp;lowercase, but they can get lost in&nbsp;an&nbsp;all-caps typeset — in&nbsp;this case, one should finely space them.</p>



<h2 id="sixth-space">Sixth Space</h2>

<p>The sixth space is&nbsp;used when the thin space is&nbsp;too large.</p>



<h2 id="hair-space">Hair Space</h2>

<p>The narrowest of spaces. In&nbsp;metal type, it&nbsp;was equal to&nbsp;1/10 of&nbsp;an&nbsp;em&nbsp;space, in&nbsp;the digital age it&nbsp;is&nbsp;mostly 1/ 24 of&nbsp;an&nbsp;em. It&nbsp;might be&nbsp;useful if&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain typeface’s punctuation marks have too tight sidebearings, but a&nbsp;thin space would be&nbsp;too wide. For example, you can use hair space to&nbsp;space dashes instead of&nbsp;thin one — everything depends on&nbsp;the sidebearings and the design of&nbsp;the particular typeface.</p>

<p>You should keep in&nbsp;mind that after you change font, selected space glyphs will remain, but their width can change, — and this will affect the texture.</p>

<p>Isn’t it&nbsp;ridiculous when a&nbsp;punctuation mark, relating to&nbsp;the entire preceding phrase, is&nbsp;tied to&nbsp;one last word of&nbsp;the said phrase? And, vice versa, how unfortunately it&nbsp;looks when there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;large gap between this mark and the previous word. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;fact, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;about time type foundry workers started thinking about it&nbsp;and cast the punctuation mark with an&nbsp;extra sidebearing on&nbsp;its left. However, typefounders are not always, or&nbsp;rather rarely, that forethoughtful, and also they are used to&nbsp;cast all letters without generous sidebearings. During punching of&nbsp;matrices, the beauty of&nbsp;spacing punctuation marks is&nbsp;also barely remembered. Therefore, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;your burden and responsibility to&nbsp;fix this <nobr>problem — </nobr>and even more it&nbsp;is&nbsp;the one of&nbsp;compositors. These latter dislike 1-pt spaces, however it&nbsp;is&nbsp;this very thin space that can save the typeset beauty in&nbsp;these situations. That is&nbsp;why, with punctuation marks <strong>, ;. … : ! ?</strong> you should insist on&nbsp;putting 1-pt (hair) space before those symbols — but only when those don’t have an&nbsp;extra sidebearing on&nbsp;their left. If&nbsp;you are in&nbsp;charge of&nbsp;purchasing a&nbsp;typeface for the printing establishment, regard this issue when ordering typefaces, make the foundry give consideration to&nbsp;the beauty of&nbsp;their work and this particular detail.

<h2 id="spacing-injustified-texts">Spacing in&nbsp;justified texts</h2>

<p>Full justification — that&nbsp;is, alignment of&nbsp;text to&nbsp;its both margins, — is&nbsp;still commonly used in&nbsp;books and magazines. When the text is&nbsp;justified, the width of&nbsp;word spaces is&nbsp;not constant, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;changing to&nbsp;distribute words to&nbsp;the entire width of&nbsp;the line. In&nbsp;this situation, the uniformity of&nbsp;spacing could be&nbsp;even more important than the very width of&nbsp;these spaces: evenly large spaces in&nbsp;the entire page are better than large spaces in&nbsp;only one line. That is&nbsp;why, no&nbsp;matter how optimised the typeface’s word spacing in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;its width&nbsp;is, it&nbsp;will not be&nbsp;enough for typesetting a&nbsp;justified text. While in&nbsp;metal type all spaces were set manually, and a&nbsp;typesetter knew what space they should add for even typesetting, nowadays it’s a&nbsp;computer that defines the length of&nbsp;spaces for justified texts. The algorithm divides the remaining space into equal parts and adds them to&nbsp;regular spaces. In&nbsp;doing&nbsp;so, the algorithm ignores letters, syntax, and punctuation, which is&nbsp;why when typesetting justified texts one should always double-check and adjust spacing manually.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;Indesign, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;possible to&nbsp;set minimum and maximum word spacing width for fully justified text typesetting: the width of&nbsp;standard space is&nbsp;used as&nbsp;a&nbsp;basis 100 %, maximum is&nbsp;normally about 120 %, minimum is&nbsp;about 80 %.</p>

<p>If&nbsp;the text is&nbsp;justified, a&nbsp;reasonable minimum word space is&nbsp;a&nbsp;fifth of&nbsp;an&nbsp;em (M/5), and M/4&nbsp;is a&nbsp;good average to&nbsp;aim for. A&nbsp;reasonable maximum in&nbsp;justified text is&nbsp;M/2. If&nbsp;it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;held to&nbsp;M/3, so&nbsp;much the better. But for loosely fitted faces, or&nbsp;text set in&nbsp;a&nbsp;small size, M/3&nbsp;is often a&nbsp;better average to&nbsp;aim for, and a&nbsp;better minimum is&nbsp;M/4. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;line of&nbsp;widely letterspaced capitals, a&nbsp;word space of&nbsp;M/2&nbsp;or more may be&nbsp;required.
<strong>Robert Bringhurst</strong>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881791326" target="_blank">The Elements of&nbsp;Typographic Style (1992)</a></p>

<p>Robert Bringhurst recommends choosing appropriate spaces based on&nbsp;an&nbsp;em. However, space is&nbsp;a&nbsp;relative value, so&nbsp;in&nbsp;justified texts you should consider not the width of&nbsp;some abstract&nbsp;em, but rather the width of&nbsp;space in&nbsp;particular font.</p>

<p>The optimal word space width in&nbsp;justified texts is&nbsp;ephemeral and changes depending on&nbsp;typeface, point size, line width, line spacing, and many other factors. That is&nbsp;why in&nbsp;Indesign you can’t set maximum and minimum values once and for all cases — you will have to&nbsp;choose the best possible options manually.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;setting justified texts, standard word space width becomes a&nbsp;fluctuating value. The fixed width space and all additional spaces with constant width can help better control the setting.</p>

<p>The more even are the gaps between words, the better &lt;…&gt;. In&nbsp;no&nbsp;case shall you allow a&nbsp;considerable disparity in&nbsp;space widths, while an&nbsp;insignificant difference won’t ruin the beauty of&nbsp;typesetting.

<h2 id="figure-space">Figure Space</h2>

<p>Figure space, or&nbsp;numeric space, is&nbsp;used for typesetting tables and sheets. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;typeface is&nbsp;fitted with tabular figures, its figure space will be&nbsp;equal to&nbsp;the width of&nbsp;tabular figures. Figure space is&nbsp;a&nbsp;non-breaking one.</p>



<p><img src="https://cdn-gc.type.today/storage/post_image/4/9/4942/image-ixsGF0udPbg8EuRFjq0Zgx_jWvrvwa6-4g.jpg" alt="8"></p>

<p><em>Normally, figure space is&nbsp;significantly wider than standard space, it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;helpful when you need to&nbsp;even a&nbsp;large amount of&nbsp;multi-digit numbers</em></p>



<h2 id="punctuation-space">Punctuation Space</h2>

<p>In&nbsp;most cases, the width of&nbsp;this space is&nbsp;equal to&nbsp;the glyph width of&nbsp;a&nbsp;period or&nbsp;a&nbsp;colon. May be&nbsp;of&nbsp;use in&nbsp;making up&nbsp;numbers in&nbsp;tables where digits are defined by&nbsp;a&nbsp;spacing element instead of&nbsp;period or&nbsp;colon.</p>



<h2 id="narrow-no-break-space">Narrow No-break Space</h2>

<p>A&nbsp;thin space that prevents an&nbsp;automatic line break. The name of&nbsp;this symbol in&nbsp;Unicode causes additional confusion: Narrow in&nbsp;this case is&nbsp;the same thing as&nbsp;Thin, and Narrow Space has the same width as&nbsp;Thin Space does.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;some applications, such as&nbsp;InDesign, the simple regular thin space is&nbsp;non-breaking by&nbsp;default and is&nbsp;called with Thin Space. In&nbsp;other cases it’s a&nbsp;separate symbol, for example, the Web uses Narrow No-break Space.</p>



<h2 id="spaces-inlayout">Spaces in&nbsp;layout</h2>

<p>The distribution of&nbsp;white space in&nbsp;text setting is&nbsp;a&nbsp;highly important factor, responsible for the neat design and the content’s clear structure. Many designers keep in&nbsp;mind correlation between point size, line width, and margins, but some tend to&nbsp;forget that word spacing is&nbsp;an&nbsp;equivalent factor of&nbsp;these relations.</p>

<p>Body text font, designed for smaller sizes, would require smaller spacing and word spaces if&nbsp;used&nbsp;to&nbsp;set a&nbsp;large headline. The point size gets more important in&nbsp;determining spacing and white unprinted area in&nbsp;general, than whether it&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;text typeface or&nbsp;a&nbsp;display one.</p>

<p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;also necessary to&nbsp;consider spacing when you’re dealing with particular elements of&nbsp;the text. For instance, small-caps or&nbsp;all-caps fragments quite often should be&nbsp;additionally spaced. Manual spacing is&nbsp;sometimes necessary in&nbsp;bold or&nbsp;italic styles, or&nbsp;even if&nbsp;no&nbsp;additional styles are applied at&nbsp;all.</p>

<h2 id="white-spaces-insoftware">White spaces in&nbsp;software</h2>

<p>Most typically, in&nbsp;non-professional software and web services there are only standard and non-breaking spaces available. You might be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;set additional symbols using clipboard almost anywhere where Unicode is&nbsp;supported. That said, you have to&nbsp;check everytime: for example, at&nbsp;the time of&nbsp;writing this piece, Facebook allows for inserting additional symbols in&nbsp;its input field, but automatically replaces them while posting.</p>

<p>Speaking of&nbsp;the Web, additional spaces are available as HTML special characters: if you use them, your source code might become a&nbsp;bit cluttered, but that would allow you to&nbsp;control the placing of&nbsp;each non-standard space. Please note that different browsers might render spacing differently, and not so&nbsp;long ago some of&nbsp;them even ignored additional spaces, replacing them by&nbsp;regular ones. You should check on&nbsp;the correct display of&nbsp;additional spaces where you use&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Two industry standards for text formatting and typesetting, InDesign and Quark Xpress, support all kinds of&nbsp;spaces. Today, type designers usually include at&nbsp;least thin and hair spaces. Their width might vary from one typeface to&nbsp;another — but the typographer, at&nbsp;least, has more control over the word spacing.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;InDesign, an&nbsp;additional space not included in&nbsp;the typeface would still be&nbsp;visible, but its width would be&nbsp;defined by&nbsp;the software with no&nbsp;regard to&nbsp;what kind of&nbsp;typeface it&nbsp;is. For example, hair space in&nbsp;24pt size will be&nbsp;1pt — both in&nbsp;a&nbsp;display face with tight spacing and in&nbsp;a&nbsp;text face with loose spacing.</p>

<p>Spaces calculated this way are not always suitable for your task. Depending on&nbsp;the typeface, the additional space width suggested by&nbsp;InDesign can be&nbsp;insufficient or&nbsp;excessive. And if&nbsp;you export the text with such spaces from InDesign to&nbsp;Figma, their width will most likely change — every software may have its own algorithms for calculating these values.</p>

<p>Be&nbsp;vigilant and trust your eye: it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not mathematical values that matter, but a&nbsp;convincing, reasonable relationship between the black and the white.</p>

Whereas in&nbsp;IBM Plex we&nbsp;perhaps should put thin space instead of&nbsp;a&nbsp;hair one</em></p>



<p>Whitespace characters are among&nbsp;the most important typographic elements. Alongside sidebearings, they define text rhythm and organise blocks of&nbsp;information. Disregard for white spaces can ruin relations between them: line and word spacing, word spacing and column-gap. In&nbsp;such case the reader wouldn’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;easily track the line and would have to&nbsp;put additional <nobr>effort — </nobr>unless this is&nbsp;your intended goal, you should always consider how different sorts of&nbsp;white space work with each other.</p>

<p>Kroger’s <a href="https://www.grocerydive.com/news/kroger-ecommerce-profitability-400M-ocado-automated-fulfillmnet-centers-delivery/805781/">announcement on Tuesday</a> that it will shutter three of its robotic e-commerce fulfillment facilities represents a sharp turnabout for the grocery company, which until recently had expressed confidence in its ability to leverage automation to run a profitable online grocery business.</p>
<p>Less than a year ago, Kroger said it <a href="https://www.grocerydive.com/news/kroger-and-ocado-plan-to-open-2-more-automated-fulfillment-centers/741254/">planned to expand</a> the fleet of high-tech fulfillment centers it has been developing in partnership with U.K.-based warehouse automation company Ocado. And in mid-2024, Kroger revealed that it would <a href="https://www.grocerydive.com/news/kroger-ocado-technology-automated-fulfillment-centers/721986/">install new technology</a> from Ocado to improve the efficiency of the warehouses.</p>



<p>When Kroger <a href="https://www.grocerydive.com/news/grocery--kroger-partners-with-ocado-in-a-bet-on-the-future-of-online-grocery/534008/">launched its partnership with Ocado</a>, the company “believed in the relentless drive to innovate way ahead of the market in order to delight our customers and advance our position as one of America’s leading e-commerce companies,” former Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4kH-atEpd4">said in a video</a> about improvements to its equipment that the automation company announced last year.</p>
<p>However, Kroger’s projected confidence came even as it was questioning whether the Ocado network was living up to expectations.</p>
<p>Kroger revealed in September 2023 that it had decided to <a href="https://www.grocerydive.com/news/kroger-ocado-grocery-cfc-delivery-pickup/693287/">pause development of the Ocado project</a> as it waited to see if sites it had already started operating would meet performance benchmarks.</p>
<p>In a further sign that its strategy was faltering, Kroger announced last March it would <a href="https://www.grocerydive.com/news/kroger-ocado-closing-3-e-commerce-fulfillment-facilities/711583/">close three spoke facilities</a> that worked in tandem with several of its robotic centers, with a spokesperson noting that the facilities “did not meet the benchmarks we set for success.”</p>
<p>By September 2025, it was clear that depending on automation as the foundation of a money-making grocery delivery business was probably not going to pan out for Kroger. Speaking during an earnings call, interim Kroger CEO Ron Sargent — who <a href="https://www.grocerydive.com/news/kroger-ceo-rodney-mcmullen-resigns-ethics-probe/741345/">took over in March</a> after McMullen’s sudden departure following an ethics probe — said the company would <a href="https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/kroger-is-reviewing-its-automated-e-commerce-fulfillment-network/759926/">conduct a “full site-by-site analysis</a>” of the Ocado network.</p>
<p>Sargent also said Kroger would refocus its e-commerce efforts on its fleet of more than 2,700 grocery supermarkets because it believed that its stores gave it a way to “reach new customer segments and expand rapid delivery capabilities without significant capital investments.”</p>


<p>Kroger said on Tuesday that its decision to close the three robotic facilities, along with other adjustments to its e-commerce operations, would provide a $400 million boost as it looks to improve e-commerce profitability. But the course-correction will be expensive, forcing Kroger to incur charges of about $2.6 billion.</p>
<p>Ken Fenyo, a former Kroger executive who now advises retailers on technology as managing partner of Pine Street Advisors, said the changes Kroger is making reflect the broader reality that grocery e-commerce has not reached the levels the industry had predicted when the COVID-19 pandemic supercharged digital sales five years ago.</p>
<p>Fenyo added that Kroger’s decision to locate the Ocado centers outside of cities turned out to be a key flaw.</p>
<p>“Ultimately those were hard places to make this model work,” said Fenyo. “You didn’t have enough people ordering, and you had a fair amount of distance to drive to get the orders to them. And so ultimately, these large centers were just not processing enough orders to pay for all that technology investment you had to make.”</p>
<p>With its automated fulfillment network, Kroger bet that consumers would be willing to trade delivery speed for sensible prices on grocery orders. That model has been highly successful for Ocado in the U.K., but U.S. consumers <a href="https://www.grocerydive.com/news/delivery-speed-is-king-for-online-shoppers-survey-shows/599282/">have shown they value speed of delivery</a>, with companies like Instacart and DoorDash expanding rapidly in recent years and rolling out services like 30-minute delivery.</p>
<p>Acknowledging this reality, Kroger noted on Tuesday that it’s <a href="https://www.grocerydive.com/news/kroger-doordash-grocery-delivery-ecommerce/761315/">deepening partnerships with third-party delivery companies</a>. The grocer also said it will pilot “capital-light, store-based automation in high-volume markets” — a seeming nod to the type of micro-fulfillment technology that grocers have tested in recent years, and that Amazon is <a href="https://www.grocerydive.com/news/amazon-whole-foods-store-within-store-automated-micro-fulfillment/804749/">currently piloting in a Whole Foods Market</a> store in Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fenyo pointed out that micro-fulfillment technology has also run into significant headwinds, adding that he thinks that outside of areas with large numbers of shoppers and high online ordering volume, putting automated order-assembly systems in stores probably doesn’t justify the cost.</p>
<p>Kroger’s decision to reduce its commitment to automation also poses a significant setback to Ocado, which has positioned its relationship with Kroger as a key endorsement of its warehouse automation technology. Shares in the U.K.-based robotics company have fallen dramatically and are now <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2025/nov/18/ocado-share-price-back-where-it-started-fancy-robots">back to their level 15 years ago</a>, when the company <a href="https://multiples.vc/public-comps/ocado-group-valuation-multiples">went public</a>.</p>

<p>LAKEVIEW — The robot revolution is here — on North Side sidewalks, at least.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With names like Stacey, Quincy and Rajesh, the boxy food delivery robots are regularly zooming down side streets — and occasionally getting stuck in the snow — to deliver Shake Shack or Taco Bell to eager patrons in Lakeview, Lincoln Park and Uptown, among other neighborhoods. They’re adorable to some, a safety hazard to others and impossible to ignore for most.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The buzzing bots are causing a stir in person and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/1pe9r72/idiot_clanker_doesnt_know_how_to_handle_the_snow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">online</a>. In neighborhood Facebook groups, they’ve found fervent support and fierce opposition, while a passionate contingent of neighbors have banded together to oust them from the city altogether.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Josh Robertson is leading that charge. The Lincoln Park resident <a href="https://nosidewalkbots.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">has launched a petition</a> calling for the city to hit pause on the robots, arguing, “Chicago sidewalks are for people, not delivery robots.”&nbsp;</p>




<p>The petition asks the city’s transportation and business departments to “release safety &amp; ADA findings, evaluate that data and local job impacts in a public hearing, and set clear rules” for the robots. As of Dec. 2, more than 1,500 people have signed the petition, 350 of whom included an “incident report” describing their interactions with the robots. </p>







<p>Robertson said he first noticed the robots in his neighborhood earlier this year and thought they were “kind of neat … . It felt futuristic.”</p>



<p>That changed when he went for a walk with his young children and a robot approached on the sidewalk, he said.</p>



<p>“This is a vehicle in the pedestrian path space that’s meant for people, and yet we ended up stepping aside, and something about that felt a little off,” Robertson said. “I began to wonder, what are our sidewalks going to be like if these programs are successful from the company’s point of view, and they continue to scale, and there are dozens and dozens of them on our sidewalks, even on quiet residential sidewalks?”</p>

<p>That’s a question many Chicagoans — including some alderpeople — are asking. The offices of <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc5Ji8m2sqS_vROI7z_2c0Eyowc9KUulyQQCozvQ9ntPRfLtQ/viewform" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Alds. Angela Clay</a> (46th) and <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdD6-uid3kVzhhyn5cpKNRG9HA3TEfl88p4DrxgvEv7I8a5Bw/viewform" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Bennett Lawson</a> (44th) have sent out surveys to neighbors in their respective wards asking them to describe their experiences and concerns with the bots and whether they support or oppose their presence.</p>



<p>“That’s the part that I wish would have happened prior to us implementing this,” said Gaby Rodriguez, of Uptown. “I at least want some control over my sidewalk. I can’t control anything else in this environment, but I can certainly have a voice in what we allow on our sidewalks.”</p>



<p>In a statement, Lawson said his office launched the survey after seeing more robots in Lakeview. The feedback “will help inform our conversations with city departments, operators and others about the future use of delivery robots in our neighborhood and around the city,” he said.</p>

<p>The delivery robot pilot program <a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2022/july/PersonalDeliveryDevicePilotProgramIntroducedCityCouncil.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">launched in Chicago in 2022</a> under then-Mayor Lori Lightfoot, and a few companies now operate app-based robots in the city. Coco rolled out last year in the 27th and 34 wards, which include parts of the Loop, Near North Side, West Loop, Near West Side, West Town and West Humboldt Park. The company recently partnered with burger chain Shake Shack.</p>







<p>Serve Robotics, used by UberEats and other food delivery apps, expanded to Chicago in late September. Serve rolled out in partnership with more than 100 restaurants in 14 Chicago neighborhoods, including East Garfield Park, Logan Square and Belmont Cragin.</p>



<p>“About half of all food deliveries globally are shorter than 2 and a half miles, which basically means that all of our cities are filled with burrito taxis,” said Viggy Ram, Serve’s vice president of policy. “This is really an effort to make short-distance delivery safer, more sustainable and reduce congestion overall.”</p>




<p>Serve is aware of the Chicago petition and welcomes the feedback, good and bad, in hopes the company can serve the city as best as it can, Ram said. The company’s goal is to expand into more neighborhoods, he said.</p>



<p>Each bot has a “contact us” label for those who want to offer feedback, Ram said.</p>



<p>“Unlike a distracted driver, they are able to look in all four directions at the same time and make the smartest, safest decision possible,” Ram said. “We see this as a much safer option for Chicago’s residents and for pedestrians.”</p>



<p>In a written statement, a representative for Coco said the company “takes safety and community partnership as our top priorities. We have been operating in Chicago for a year with strong community support. We maintain strict protocols for sidewalk safety, ADA compliance and incident response.”</p>

<p>Some residents have come to the defense of the delivery robots, and even taken a liking to them. One Lakeview neighbor noted a Serve bot gave her “a friendly beep.”</p>



<p>“They are starting to know who are fans,” she said.</p>



<p>Rodriguez thinks that’s intentional, the cutesy design and human-sounding names of the robots distract from what he said are the real issues of accessibility and functionality, particularly for neighbors with disabilities.</p>



<p>Rodriguez argues that the companies have parachuted into Chicago communities without an understanding of, or a desire to learn, neighborhoods’ specific needs, and he worries that while residents currently have the option to use the delivery bot services, they may not have a choice in the future.</p>



<p>“What other corporations are we going to allow on our sidewalks? That’s the last place that was meant to be human-centric, right?” Rodriguez said. “I don’t want to lose that access and give open road for corporations to now start using our sidewalks, which they haven’t in the past.”</p>

<p>Rodriguez said he recently called Clay’s office to vent his concerns, and the alderwoman seemed unaware of the quantity and reach of the delivery robots.</p>



<p>Maria Barnes, the 46th ward’s business liaison, confirmed Clay’s office has fielded many concerns from neighbors, though it’s too early to make any conclusions or recommendations based on the survey results, she said.</p>



<p>“We’re still getting feedback from constituents, as well as the companies that are operating these devices. It’s ongoing, so at this point it’s a little premature to form any opinions,” Barnes said.</p>



<p>Robertson shares Rodriguez’s concerns, pointing to incident reports of the robots pushing neighbors off the sidewalks onto busy streets, colliding with bicyclists and even deterring emergency vehicles.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Becca Girsch, executive director of the Lakeview/Roscoe Village Chamber of Commerce, said the organization hasn’t spoken directly with Coco or Serve Robotics but has taken note of the polarizing reaction in recent weeks as Robertson’s petition continues to garner signatures.</p>



<p>“It’s hard not to pay attention,” Girsch said. “It seems like the winds are against the robots. I think right now we’re hearing mostly the negative. So if that’s the trend, then I’m not sure how long this pilot program will sustain itself.”</p>



<p>Robertson said he’s hopeful for a future where, even if the delivery bots continue to be used in the city, they’re better implemented into residents’ lives.</p>



<p>“The fact that they’re responding to this quickly tells me that Chicagoans’ voices are beginning to be heard on this issue,” Robertson said.&nbsp;“These are suddenly such a visible and such a big part of our public lives that we need to make sure that the right level of attention and the right discussions are happening, to weigh the pros and the cons and again, to ultimately ask, what kind of neighborhoods do we want to build?”</p>
