Wei, in Tokyo.</p>
    
<p>“It is very meaningful from the perspective of Japanese economic security, and I would like the project to move forward as proposed, by all means,” Takaichi said during the meeting.</p><p>The advanced chips set to be made in Kumamoto will be used in AI, robotics and autonomous driving, sectors that Takaishi’s cabinet has designated as strategically important fields.</p>



<p>TSMC’s first Kumamoto plant started mass production in late 2024 and makes less advanced chips. The company also is building new plants in Arizona in the U.S. to create a fabrication plant cluster and meet growing demand from customers building on the global AI frenzy.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Anthropic recently published a blog post about <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-c-compiler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">building a C compiler entirely with Claude</a>
. They called it CCC (Claude’s C Compiler) and claimed it could compile the Linux kernel. 100% of the code was written by Claude Opus 4.6, a human only guided the process by writing test cases. That sounded interesting enough to test the claim and benchmark CCC against the industry standard GCC.</p>
<p>The source code of CCC is available at <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claudes-c-compiler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claudes-c-compiler</a>
. It is written entirely in Rust, targeting x86-64, i686, AArch64 and RISC-V 64. The frontend, SSA-based IR, optimizer, code generator, peephole optimizers, assembler, linker and DWARF debug info generation are all implemented from scratch with zero compiler-specific dependencies. That is a lot of work for an AI to do.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-compiler-assembler-and-linker">What is a Compiler, Assembler and Linker?</h2>
<p>Before we jump into the comparison, it helps to understand what happens when you compile a C program. There are four stages involved.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@gpradinett/the-four-stages-of-the-gcc-compiler-preprocessor-compiler-assembler-linker-3dec8714bb9c" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*YummodV7MDImgo0ywwmxlA.png" alt="GCC Compilation Stages"></a>

<em>Image credit: <a href="https://medium.com/@gpradinett/the-four-stages-of-the-gcc-compiler-preprocessor-compiler-assembler-linker-3dec8714bb9c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The four stages of the gcc compiler</a>
</em></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Preprocessor</strong>: Handles <code>#include</code>, <code>#define</code> and other directives. It takes the source code and produces expanded source code.</li>
<li><strong>Compiler</strong>: Takes the preprocessed source code and translates it into assembly language. This is where the real heavy lifting happens, understanding the C language, type checking, optimizations, register allocation and so on.</li>
<li><strong>Assembler</strong>: Converts the assembly language into machine code (object files). It has to know the exact instruction encoding for the target CPU architecture.</li>
<li><strong>Linker</strong>: Takes one or more object files and combines them into a single executable. It resolves references between files, sets up memory layout and produces the final binary.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-compilers-are-beasts">Why Compilers Are Beasts</h2>
<p>Writing a programming language is hard (prior vibe coding). Writing a compiler is on another level entirely. A programming language defines the rules. A compiler has to understand those rules, translate them into machine instructions, optimize the output for speed and size, handle edge cases across different CPU architectures and produce correct code every single time.</p>
<p>GCC has been in development since 1987. That is close to 40 years of work by thousands of contributors. It supports dozens of architectures, hundreds of optimization passes and millions of edge cases that have been discovered and fixed over the decades. The optimization passes alone (register allocation, function inlining, loop unrolling, vectorization, dead code elimination, constant propagation) represent years of PhD-level research. This is one of the reasons why it’s ubiquitous.</p>
<p>This is why CCC being able to compile real C code at all is noteworthy. But it also explains why the output quality is far from what GCC produces. Building a compiler that parses C correctly is one thing. Building one that produces fast and efficient machine code is a completely different challenge.</p>
<h2 id="why-the-compiler-is-the-easy-part">Why the Compiler Is the “Easy” Part</h2>
<p>Ironically, among the four stages, the compiler (translation to assembly) is the most approachable one for an AI to build. It is mostly about pattern matching and rule application: take C constructs and map them to assembly patterns.</p>
<p>The assembler is harder than it looks. It needs to know the exact binary encoding of every instruction for the target architecture. x86-64 alone has thousands of instruction variants with complex encoding rules (REX prefixes, ModR/M bytes, SIB bytes, displacement sizes). Getting even one bit wrong means the CPU will do something completely unexpected.</p>
<p>The linker is arguably the hardest. It has to handle relocations, symbol resolution across multiple object files, different section types, position-independent code, thread-local storage, dynamic linking and format-specific details of ELF binaries. The Linux kernel linker script alone is hundreds of lines of layout directives that the linker must get exactly right.</p>
<h2 id="why-sqlite-and-not-the-linux-kernel">Why SQLite and Not the Linux Kernel?</h2>
<p>The Linux kernel is one of the most complex C codebases in the world. It has millions of lines of code, uses GCC-specific extensions, inline assembly, linker scripts and countless tricks that push the compiler to its limits. It is not a good first test for a new compiler.</p>
<p>SQLite, on the other hand, is distributed as a single amalgamation file (one big <code>.c</code> file). It is standard C, well-tested and self-contained. If your compiler can handle SQLite, it can handle a lot. If it cannot handle SQLite correctly, there is no point testing anything bigger.</p>
<p>That is why I tested both. SQLite tells us about correctness and runtime performance. The kernel tells us about scale and compatibility.</p>

<p>CCC was built with the <code>gcc_m16</code> Cargo feature, which delegates 16-bit real-mode boot code (<code>-m16</code> flag) to GCC. This is needed because CCC’s i686 backend produces code too large for the 32KB real-mode limit. The x86_64 C code is compiled entirely by CCC.</p>
<p>A <code>ccc_wrapper.sh</code> script routes <code>.S</code> assembly files to GCC (CCC does not process assembly) and all <code>.c</code> files to CCC.</p>

<p>Compilers are usually measured on below scenarios. Hence, tests are also designed around them.</p>
<ol>
<li>Time to compile code</li>
<li>Size of compiled code</li>

<h3 id="fair-comparison-principles">Fair Comparison Principles</h3>
<ol>
<li>Same hardware – identical VM specs for both compilers</li>
<li>Same source code – identical kernel config, identical SQLite amalgamation</li>
<li>Both run to completion – no tests killed prematurely</li>
<li>CCC gets help where needed – <code>gcc_m16</code> feature for boot code, wrapper for assembly files</li>
<li>Same benchmark script – <code>benchmark_sqlite.sh</code> runs identically on both VMs</li>

<h3 id="what-happened">What Happened</h3>
<p>CCC compiled every single C source file in the Linux 6.9 kernel without a single compiler error (0 errors, 96 warnings). This is genuinely impressive for a compiler built entirely by an AI.</p>
<p>However, the build failed at the linker stage with around 40,784 undefined reference errors. The errors follow two patterns:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>__jump_table</code> relocations – CCC generates incorrect relocation entries for kernel jump labels (used for static keys/tracepoints)</li>
<li><code>__ksymtab</code> references – CCC produces malformed symbol table entries for kernel module exports</li>
</ol>
<p>These are linker-visible bugs in CCC’s relocation/symbol generation, not C language compilation bugs. This is a good example of why the linker is the hardest part. The compiler did its job fine, but the generated relocations were not quite right for the kernel’s complex linker script.</p>

<p>CCC <code>-O0</code> and <code>-O2</code> produce byte-identical binaries (4,374,024 bytes). CCC has 15 SSA optimization passes, but they all run at every optimization level. There is no tiered optimization – the <code>-O</code> flag is accepted but completely ignored.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-matters-for-the--o2-comparison">Why This Matters for the “-O2” Comparison</h3>
<p>When you ask GCC to compile with <code>-O2</code>, it performs dozens of extra optimization passes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instruction selection: choosing the best x86 instructions</li>
<li>Register allocation: fitting variables into CPU registers so they do not spill to slow memory</li>
<li>Loop unrolling: duplicating loop bodies to reduce branch overhead</li>
<li>Function inlining: embedding small functions directly into their callers</li>
<li>Dead code elimination: removing unreachable code paths</li>
<li>Vectorization: using SIMD instructions (SSE/AVX) to process multiple values at once</li>
</ul>
<p>GCC’s <code>-O2</code> spends 7 minutes doing this work, and the payoff is clear: the resulting binary runs 1.7x faster (6.1s vs 10.3s).</p>
<p>CCC does none of this at any optimization level. Comparing “CCC compile time vs GCC -O2 compile time” is like comparing a printer that only prints in black-and-white vs one that does full color. The black-and-white printer is faster, but it is doing the same job.</p>

<h2 id="root-cause-analysis--why-ccc-code-is-slow">Root Cause Analysis – Why CCC Code is Slow</h2>
<h3 id="1-register-spilling">1. Register Spilling</h3>
<p>Modern CPUs have a small set of fast storage locations called registers. A good compiler tries to keep frequently used variables in these registers. When there are more variables than registers, the compiler “spills” them to the stack (regular RAM), which is much slower.</p>
<p>CCC’s biggest performance problem is excessive register spilling. SQLite’s core execution engine <code>sqlite3VdbeExec</code> is a single function with 100+ local variables and a massive switch statement. CCC does not have good register allocation, so it spills almost all variables to the stack.</p>
<p>GCC -O0 (383 lines, uses stack but efficiently):</p>

<p>The 2.78x code bloat means more instruction cache misses, which compounds the register spilling penalty.</p>
<h3 id="5-no-symbol-table-generation">5. No Symbol Table Generation</h3>
<p>CCC-compiled binaries lack internal function symbols (<code>nm</code> reports 0 symbols, <code>readelf</code> shows only 90 PLT stubs vs GCC’s 1,500+ functions). This makes profiling and debugging impossible.</p>
<h3 id="why-subqueries-are-158000x-slower">Why Subqueries Are 158,000x Slower</h3>
<p>The <code>NOT IN (subquery)</code> pattern causes SQLite to execute a nested loop: for each of the around 100,000 rows in the outer table, it scans through around 10,000 rows in the inner table. That is roughly 1 billion iterations through SQLite’s main execution function (<code>sqlite3VdbeExec</code>), which is basically a giant switch statement.</p>
<p>With CCC’s roughly 4x per-iteration overhead from register spilling, plus extra cache misses from the 2.78x larger binary (the CPU cannot keep all the instructions in its fast cache), the slowdown compounds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each individual iteration: around 4x slower (register spilling)</li>
<li>Cache pressure: around 2-3x additional penalty (instructions do not fit in L1/L2 cache)</li>
<li>Combined over a billion iterations: 158,000x total slowdown</li>
</ul>
<p>This is why simple queries (INSERT, DROP TABLE) are only 1-2x slower, but nested operations blow up to 100,000x+ slower.</p>

<h2 id="the-hello-world-that-could-not">The Hello World That Could Not</h2>
<p>Within hours of Anthropic releasing CCC, someone opened <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claudes-c-compiler/issues/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issue #1</a>
 – “Hello world does not compile”. The example straight from the README did not work on a fresh Fedora or Ubuntu install:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>$ ./target/release/ccc -o hello hello.c
</span></span><span><span>/usr/include/stdio.h:34:10: error: stddef.h: No such file or directory
</span></span><span><span>/usr/include/stdio.h:37:10: error: stdarg.h: No such file or directory
</span></span><span><span>ccc: error: <span>2</span> preprocessor error<span>(</span>s<span>)</span> in hello.c
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Meanwhile, GCC compiled it just fine. The issue was that CCC’s preprocessor did not search the right system include paths for <code>stddef.h</code> and <code>stdarg.h</code> (these come from the compiler, not the C library). It got 288 thumbs-up reactions, over 200 comments and turned into one of those legendary GitHub threads where people tag <code>@claude</code> asking it to fix the bug, ask <code>@grok</code> for summaries and post comments like “my job is safe”.</p>
<p>Someone got it working on Compiler Explorer and remarked that the assembly output “reminds me of the quality of an undergraduate’s compiler assignment”. Which, to be fair, is both harsh and not entirely wrong when you look at the register spilling patterns.</p>
<p>The issue is still open at the time of writing.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Claude’s C Compiler is a remarkable achievement. It is a working C compiler built entirely by an AI that can correctly compile 2,844 files from the Linux kernel without a single error. It produces functionally correct code (verified with SQLite – all queries return correct results, all crash tests pass).</p>
<p>But it is not ready for real use:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The output code is very slow. CCC-compiled SQLite takes 2 hours to run a benchmark that GCC finishes in 10 seconds. The root cause is poor register allocation – CCC uses a single register as a shuttle to move values between stack locations, turning every operation into multiple memory accesses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The “compiles the kernel” claim needs a footnote. CCC compiles all the C source files, but the final binary cannot be produced because CCC generates incorrect relocations for kernel data structures (<code>__jump_table</code>, <code>__ksymtab</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimization flags are decorative. Passing <code>-O2</code> or <code>-O3</code> to CCC does literally nothing – the output binary is byte-identical to <code>-O0</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For Anthropic’s stated goal of demonstrating that Claude can build complex software, CCC is a genuine success. For anyone wanting to compile software to actually run efficiently, GCC (or Clang, or any production compiler) remains the only real option.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Throughout my career, I feel like I’ve done a pretty decent job of staying top of new developments in the industry: attending conferences, following (and later befriending!) some of the very smart people writing the specs, being the one sharing news on Slack about exciting new features of CSS or JS with my colleagues. The joys of working on an internal tool where you only need to worry about latest Chrome, and playing with anchor positioning in a production app while it’s still experimental!</p>
<p>It’s very unsettling, then, to find myself feeling like I’m in danger of being left behind - like I’m missing something. As much as I don’t like it, so many people have started going so hard on LLM-generated code in a way that I just can’t wrap my head around.</p>
<p>I’ve been using Copilot - and more recently Claude - as a sort of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2026/jan/18/tech-ai-bubble-burst-reverse-centaur">“spicy autocomplete”</a> and occasional debugging assistant for some time, but any time I try to get it to do anything remotely clever, it completely shits the bed. Don’t get me wrong, I know that a large part of this is me holding it wrong, but I find it hard to justify the value of investing so much of my time perfecting the art of asking a machine to write what I could do perfectly well in less time than it takes to hone the prompt.</p>
<p>You’ve got to give it enough context - but not too much or it gets overloaded. You’re supposed to craft lengthy prompts that massage the AI assistant’s apparently fragile ego by telling it “you are an expert in distributed systems” as if it were an insecure, mediocre software developer.</p>
<p>Or I could just write the damn code in less time than all of this takes to get working.</p>
<p>As I see more and more people generating code instead of writing it, I find myself wondering why engineers are so ready and willing to do away with one of the good bits of our jobs (coding) and leave themselves with the boring bit (reviews).</p>
<p>Perhaps people enjoy writing roleplay instructions for computers, I don’t know. But I find it dangerous that people will willingly - and proudly - pump their products full of generated code.</p>
<p>I’ll share a couple of the arguments I’ve encountered when I’ve expressed concern about this.</p>
<h2 id="this-is-the-industrial-revolution-of-our-time-it-s-like-mechanisation-all-over-again" tabindex="-1">“This is the Industrial Revolution of our time! It’s like mechanisation all over again.”</h2>
<p>Yes, this is true in many ways.</p>
<p>Firstly, when you consider how much the Industrial Revolution <a href="https://www.oerproject.com/OER-Materials/OER-Media/HTML-Articles/Climate/Unit1/The-Industrial-Revolution-and-Climate-Change">contributed to climate change</a>, and look at the <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/energy-and-ai/energy-demand-from-ai">energy consumption</a> of the data centres powering AI software, it’s easy to see parallels there. Granted, not all of this electricity is fossil-fuel-powered, so that’s some improvement on the Industrial Revolution, but we’re still wasting enormous amounts of resources generating pictures of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-facebook-ban-ai-slop-images-shrimp-jesus-why-2024-6">shrimp Jesus</a>.</p>
<p>Mechanisation made goods cheaper and more widely available, but at the cost of quality: it’s been a race to the bottom since the late 19th century and now we have websites like SHEIN where you can buy a highly flammable pair of trousers for less than a cup of coffee. Mechanisation led to a decline in skilled labour, made worse by companies gradually offshoring their factories to less economically developed countries where they could take advantage of poorly-paid workers with fewer rights, and make even more money.</p>
<p>Generated code is rather a lot like fast fashion: it looks all right at first glance but it doesn’t hold up over time, and when you look closer it’s full of holes. Just like fast fashion, it’s often <a href="https://www.sundaypost.com/fp/our-designer-fear-small-firms-alarm-at-impact-of-high-street-copy-cats/">ripped off other people’s designs</a>. And it’s a scourge on the environment.</p>
<p>But there’s a key difference. Mechanisation involved replacing human effort in the manufacturing processes with machinery that could do the same job. It’s the equivalent of a codemod or a script that generates boilerplate code. The key thing is that it <em>produces the same results each time</em>. And if something went wrong, humans would be able to peer inside the machine and figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p>LLM output is <strong>non-deterministic</strong>, and the inner workings opaque. There’s no utility in a mechanised process that spits out something different every time, often peppered with hallucinations.</p>
<h2 id="ll-ms-are-just-another-layer-of-abstraction-like-higher-level-programming-languages-were-to-assembly" tabindex="-1">“LLMs are just another layer of abstraction, like higher level programming languages were to assembly.”</h2>
<p>It’s true that writing Java or Go means I never had to bother learning assembly. The closest I get to anything resembling assembly is knitting patterns.</p>
<p>The way that we write software has evolved in terms of what we need to think about (depending on your language of choice): I don't have to think about garbage collection or memory allocation because the runtime does it for me. But I do still have to think about writing efficient code that makes sense architecturally in the wider context of our existing systems. I have to think about how the software I'm building will affect critical paths, and reason about maintainability versus speed of delivery. When building for the web, we have to think about browser support, accessibility, security, performance.</p>
<p>Where I've seen LLMs do the most damage is where engineers outsource the <em>thinking</em> that should go into software development. LLMs can't reason about what the system architecture should be because <em>they cannot reason</em>. They do not think. So if we're not thinking and they're not thinking that means nobody is thinking. Nothing good can come from software nobody has thought about.</p>
<p>In the wake of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Post_Office_scandal">Horizon scandal</a>, where innocent Post Office staff went to prison because of bugs in Post Office software that led management to think they’d been stealing money, we need to be thinking about our software more than ever: we need <em>accountability</em> in our software.</p>
<p>Thirteen people killed themselves as a direct result of those bugs in that Post Office software, by the way.</p>
<h3 id="our-terrible-code-is-the-problem" tabindex="-1">Our terrible code is the problem</h3>
<p>But, you may argue, human developers today write inaccessible, unperformant, JavaScript-heavy code! What's the difference?</p>
<p>Yes, <em>exactly</em> (or should I say “You’re absolutely right”?). LLMs are trained (without our explicit consent) on all our shitty code, and we've taught them that that's what they should be outputting. They are doomed to repeat humans’ mistakes, then be trained on the shitty reconstituted mistakes made by other LLMs in what’s (brilliantly) been called <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/ai-dark-forest#2-be-original-critical-and-sophisticated">human centipede epistemology</a>. We don't write good enough code as humans to deserve something that writes the same stuff faster.</p>
<p>And if you think we’ve done all right so far, we haven't: just ask anyone who uses assistive technology, or lives in a country with terrible Internet connection (or tries to get online on mobile data in any UK city, to be honest). Ask anyone who's being racially discriminated against by facial recognition software or even a hand dryer. Ask the Post Office staff.</p>
<p>Instead of wanting to learn and improve as humans, and build better software, we’ve outsourced our mistakes to an unthinking algorithm.</p>
<h3 id="four-eyes-good-two-eyes-bad" tabindex="-1">Four eyes good, two eyes bad</h3>
<p>Jessica Rose and Eda Eren gave a <a href="https://2025.ffconf.org/jessica-eda">brilliant talk</a> at FFConf last year about the danger of AI coding assistants making us lose our skills. There was one slide in particular that stood out to me:</p>
<figure><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://localghost.dev/img/xpP6-QQSQg-280.webp 280w, https://localghost.dev/img/xpP6-QQSQg-640.webp 640w, https://localghost.dev/img/xpP6-QQSQg-960.webp 960w" sizes="auto"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://localghost.dev/img/xpP6-QQSQg-280.jpeg" alt="Jess and Eda on stage at FFConf in front of a slide that says &quot;Code you did not write is code you do not understand.
You cannot maintain code you do not understand.&quot;" width="960" height="720" srcset="https://localghost.dev/img/xpP6-QQSQg-280.jpeg 280w, https://localghost.dev/img/xpP6-QQSQg-640.jpeg 640w, https://localghost.dev/img/xpP6-QQSQg-960.jpeg 960w" sizes="auto"></picture></figure>
<p>The difference between reviewing a PR written by human and one by an LLM is that there's a certain amount of trust in a PR by a colleague, especially one that I know. The PR has been reasoned about: someone has thought about this code. There are exceptions to every rule, yes: but I'd expect manager intervention for somebody constantly raising bad PRs.</p>
<p>Open source maintainers will tell you about the deluge of poor quality generated PRs they're seeing nowadays. As a contributor to any repository, you are accountable for the code you commit, even if it was generated by an LLM. The reviewer also holds some accountability, but you’ve still got two pairs of eyes on the change.</p>
<p>I’ve seen social media posts from companies showing off that they’re using e.g. Claude to generate PRs for small changes by just chatting to the agent on Slack. Claude auto-generates the code, then creates the PR. At that point accountability sits solely with the reviewer. Unless you set up particularly strict rules, one person can ask Claude to do something and then approve that PR: we’ve lost one of those pairs of eyes, and there's less shared context in the team as a result.</p>
<p>Reviewing PR isn't just about checking for bugs: it’s about sharing understanding of the code and the changes. Many companies don't do PRs at all and commit directly to the main branch, but the only way I've personally seen that work consistently at scale is if engineers are pairing constantly. That way you still have shared context about changes going in.</p>
<h2 id="i-m-not-anti-progress-i-m-anti-hype" tabindex="-1">I'm not anti-progress, I'm anti-hype</h2>
<p>I think it’s important to highlight at this stage that I am not, in fact, “anti-LLM”. I’m anti-the branding of it as “artificial intelligence”, because it’s not <em>intelligent</em>. It’s a form of machine learning. “Generative AI” is just a very good Markov chain that people expect far too much from.</p>
<p>I don’t even begrudge people using generative AI to generate prototypes. If you need to just quickly chuck together a wireframe or an interactive demo, it makes a lot of sense. My worry is more around people thinking they can “vibe code” their way to production-ready software, or hand off the actual thinking behind the coding.</p>
<p>Mikayla Maki had a <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/on-programming-with-agents">particularly good take</a> on working with agents: keep the human in the loop, treat them like an external contributor you don’t trust. Only use agents for tasks you already know how to do, because it’s vital that you understand it.</p>
<p>I will continue using my spicy autocomplete, but I’m not outsourcing my thinking any time soon. Stop generating, start understanding, and remember what we enjoyed about doing this in the first place.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Using nationally representative data from the 2020 and 2024 American National Election Studies (ANES), this paper traces how the U.S. social media landscape has shifted across platforms, demographics, and politics. Overall platform use has declined, with the youngest and oldest Americans increasingly abstaining from social media altogether. Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter/X have lost ground, while TikTok and Reddit have grown modestly, reflecting a more fragmented digital public sphere. Platform audiences have aged and become slightly more educated and diverse. Politically, most platforms have moved toward Republican users while remaining, on balance, Democratic-leaning. Twitter/X has experienced the sharpest shift: posting has flipped nearly 50 percentage points from Democrats to Republicans. Across platforms, political posting remains tightly linked to affective polarization, as the most partisan users are also the most active. As casual users disengage and polarized partisans remain vocal, the online public sphere grows smaller, sharper, and more ideologically extreme.

<p>Not sure if it’s just me, but I often get a primal satisfaction whenever I see intricate patterns emerging out of seemingly disordered environments.</p>
<p>Think about the galleries of ant colonies, the absurdly perfect hexagons of honeycombs, or the veins on a leaf. No architect, no blueprint. Just simple rules stacking on each other that result in beautiful patterns. I&nbsp;can’t explain why, but seeing those structures always felt good.</p>
<p>Humans do this too. And for me, one of the most fascinating patterns we’ve come up with is the roads.</p>
<p>Sometimes I imagine aliens from faraway galaxies discovering Earth long after we’re gone. Forests reclaimed by nature, cities reduced to rubble, yet between them, a faintly pattern is still visible - the road network. I like to think they will feel the same way I do when looking at nature patterns. - “Man, someone really thought this through.”</p>
<h2 id="city-builders-and-their-roads">City Builders and Their Roads</h2>
<p>I’ve got to say, roads have fascinated me since I was a kid.</p>
<p>I still remember playing SimCity 2000 for the first time when I was about five or six years old. I didn’t understand much. Definitely didn’t know what zoning, taxes, or demand were. But roads fascinated me from the start.</p>
<p>I think roads lie at the heart of every city builder. It’s the fabric on which cities are built. Since that moment, I’ve played almost every modern-themed city builder out there. In the meantime, I’ve also started noticing them in the real world. Examining them in more detail.</p>
<p>Roundabouts. Interchanges. Overpasses. Merge lanes. Noticing every intricacy.</p>
<p>Despite every game bringing an improvement over the one before, something always felt… off.</p>
<p>SimCity 4 added elevation and diagonal roads. SimCity 2013 introduced curved roads. Then came Cities: Skylines with a ton of freedom. You could know freeplace roads and merge them into intersections at any angle, build flyovers at different elevations to construct crazy, yet unrealistic, interchanges. I think this was the largest breakthrough.</p>
<p>But something was still nagging me. Highway ramps were unrealistically sharp or wobbly, lanes that were supposed to be high-speed bent too sharply at certain points, and the corner radii of intersections looked strange.</p>
<p><img src="https://sandboxspirit.com/_astro/cs1-interchange.3sVgQli1_1MWSzs.webp" alt="CS2" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1400" height="600"></p>
<p>I mean look at this. This is probably what highway engineers have nightmares about.</p>
<p>And then came the mods. Mods changed everything. The great community enabled a new kind of freedom. One could build almost anything: perfect merge lanes, realistic markings, and smooth transitions. It was a total game-changer. I am particularly proud of this 5-lane turbo roundabout:</p>
<p><img src="https://sandboxspirit.com/_astro/cs1-roundabout.BduLCJs__ZQmkvk.webp" alt="Alt" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1600" height="1200"></p>
<p>But even then, mods didn’t feel completely natural. They were still limited by the game’s original system.</p>
<p>Cities: Skylines 2 pushed it even further, with lanes becoming even more realistic and markings as well. I&nbsp;think at this point, a non-trained eye won’t know the difference from reality.</p>
<p>Then I stopped stumbling around and started asking why?  I tried to understand how engineers design roads and how game developers code them.</p>
<p>That’s when I ran straight into the fundamental issue - right at the base of it. And it comes to something every developer knows about and loves:</p>
<h2 id="the-bezier-spline">The Bezier Spline</h2>
<p>If you’re a Unity or Unreal developer or played with basically any vector graphics editing software, you already know them well. Bezier curves are an elegant, intuitive, and incredibly powerful way to smoothly interpolate between two points while taking into consideration some direction of movement (the tangent).</p>
<p>That’s exactly what roads are supposed to do, right? Of course, developers naturally think they are the perfect tool.</p>
<p>They’ve got <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVwxzDHniEw" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">their beauty</a>, I need to admit. But hidden beneath the surface lies an uncomfortable truth.</p>
<h2 id="when-bezier-splines-fall-short">When Bezier Splines fall short</h2>
<p>You see, the shapes of roads in real life come from an underlying essential fact: the wheel axles of a vehicle. No matter how you drive a car, the distance between the left and right wheels remains constant. You can notice this in tyre tracks in snow or sand. Two perfectly parallel paths, always the same distance apart maintaining a consistent curved shape.</p>
<p>Cars don’t follow abstract splines. They ride some imaginary tracks.</p>
<p>Here’s the issue with Bezier splines: they don’t preserve shape and curvature when offset.</p>
<p>At gentle curves, they kinda look fine, but once you have tighter bends, the math falls apart. In mathy terms: The offset of a Bezier curve is not a Bezier curve.</p>
<p>When game engines try to generate a road mesh along a Bezier spline, the geometry often fails at tight angles. The inner edge curves at a different rate than the outer edge. This creates “pinching,” self-intersecting geometry.</p>
<p>Here is the best example of how they start to fail in extreme scenarios.</p>
<p><img src="https://sandboxspirit.com/_astro/cs2_ss.ifkcMlbs_Z114U2O.webp" alt="CS2" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1400" height="510"></p>
<p>To sum up: Bézier curves are unconstrained. The freedom they enable is exactly the “Achilles’ heel”. Real roads are engineered with the constraints of real motion in mind. A car’s path can’t magically self-intersect.</p>
<h2 id="kindergarten-math">Kindergarten math</h2>
<p>Ok, so what preserves parallelism? If you’ve already been through kindergarten, you’re already familiar with it: It’s the <strong>CIRCLE</strong>.</p>
<p>It has almost like a magical property: no matter how much you offset it, the result is still a circular arc. Perfectly parallel with the initial one. So satisfying.</p>
<p><img src="https://sandboxspirit.com/_astro/bezier_vs_cricle.DiRZrhJA_2hP7ef.webp" alt="Bezier vs Circle" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="1401" height="511"></p>
<p>Scrapping Bezier curves for Circle Arcs also yields a nice, unexpected bonus. To procedurally build intersections, the engine has to perform many curve-curve intersection operations multiple times per frame. The intersection between two Bezier curves is notoriously complex. On one side, you have polynomial root finding, iterative numerical methods, de Castelaju’s method + bounding boxes, and multiple convergence checks vs a simple, plain O(1) formula in Circle Arcs.</p>
<p>By stitching together circular arcs of different radii, you can create any shape while adhering to proper engineering principles.</p>
<h2 id="the-next-level">The Next Level</h2>
<p>But this is not the end of the story. Circle arcs have issues as well (Oh no). The problem with circles in infrastructure is that they have constant curvature. What this means is that when entering a circular curve from a straight line, the lateral force jumps from 0 to a fixed constant value (determined by the radius of the circle). If you were in a car or train entering at high speed into this kind of curve, it would feel terrible.</p>
<p>Civil engineers have to account for this as well. So then, what curve maintains parallelism when offset and has a smoothly increasing curvature?</p>
<p>Introduce you to: transition curves - most famously, the clothoid.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_spiral" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">clothoid</a> gradually increases curvature over distance. You start almost straight, then slowly turn tighter and tighter. The steering wheel rotates smoothly. The forces ramp up naturally, and a passenger’s body barely notices the transition.</p>
<p>These curves provide comfortable rides at high speeds by maintaining parallel offsets and continuous curvature changes.</p>
<p>And they are also… a math nightmare. Differential geometry. Integrals. Oh my… Which is probably why most games don’t even dare.</p>
<p>But that’s fine.</p>
<p>Vehicles move slowly on city streets. For intersections of urban roads, circular arcs are more than a decent  choice.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-built-my-own-road-system">Why I Built My Own Road System</h2>
<p>Does everything I just rambled about matter? Do 99% of city-builder players care what shape the corner radius of the intersection has? Most likely, no. Then why bother?</p>
<p>First, because of curiosity. As any other nerd overly obsessed with the nitty-gritty details of a very specific subject, I just wanted to see how I would implement it. Like challenging the status quo.</p>
<p>Second, even if established titles might not accurately render roads, they are still light-years ahead of what solutions an indie developer can find online. The tutorials and assets for this are just sad. I personally got bored with grids, and I just wanted to built a better solution to share with anyone who wants to build a city builder.</p>

<p>These assets ^ make me sad.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-first_letter="L">
		<p>Little more than a month after I reported that Google’s AI was <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2025/12/11/how-online-search-and-ai-can-install-malware/">offering links to malicious scripts</a>, that is happening again, with a slight twist. I’m grateful to Olena of Clario for informing me that there’s a new campaign in progress to deliver AMOS (alias SOMA) stealers to Macs. You can read Vladyslav Kolchin’s account of this in <a href="https://mackeeper.com/blog/suspicious-ads-on-google-which-contain-harmful-content-for-mac-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Vladyslav has discovered these in forged Apple-like sites linked from docs.google.com and business.google.com, as well as in articles posted on Medium. I had success in finding the last of those, which appeared at the top of Google’s sponsored results when searching for <code>how to clear cache on macos tahoe</code>.</p>

<p>That took me to Clear Mareks’ stories in medium.com, where there’s the familiar ploy to get us to paste a malicious command into Terminal. On another occasion, you might be presented with a page claiming to be official Apple Support, although it obviously isn’t.</p>

<p>This is almost identical to the previous attack via ChatGPT, and even the base-64 obfuscation is very similar.</p>

<p>This downloaded and ran an AMOS stealer, which unusually didn’t seem too bothered about being run in a locked-down virtual machine.</p>

<p>It immediately started copying the contents of my Documents folder to “FileGrabber”, and wrote several hidden files to the top level of my Home folder, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>.agent, an AppleScript to run the theft</li>
<li>.mainHelper, the main Mach-O binary</li>
<li>.pass, my password in plain text.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those appear the same as the version of AMOS delivered using last year’s ChatGPT deception. In addition to seeking access to the Documents folder, the malware asked for access to Notes.</p>

<p>The messages are the same. First, distrust everything you see in search engines. Assess what they return critically, particularly anything that’s promoted. It’s promoted for a reason, and that’s money, so before you click on any link ask how that’s trying to make money from you.</p>
<p>Next, check the provenance and authenticity of where that click takes you. In this case, it was to a Medium article that had been poisoned to trick you. When you’re looking for advice, look for a URL that’s part of a site you recognise as a reputable Mac specialist. Never follow a shortened link without expanding it using a utility like <strong>Link Unshortener</strong> from the App Store, rather than one of the potentially malicious sites that claims to perform that service.</p>
<p>When you think you’ve found a solution, don’t follow it blindly, be critical. Never run any command in Terminal unless it comes from a reputable source that explains it fully, and you have satisfied yourself that you understand exactly what it does. In this case the command provided was obfuscated to hide its true action, and should have rung alarm bells as soon as you saw it.</p>
<p>If you were to spare a few moments to read what it contains, you would have seen the command <code>curl</code>, which is commonly used by malware to fetch their payloads without any quarantine xattr being attached to them. Even though the rest of the script had been concealed by base-64 encoding, that shouts out that this is malicious.</p>
<p>Why can’t macOS protect you from this? Because at each step you have been tricked into bypassing its protections. Terminal isn’t intended to be a place for the innocent to paste obfuscated commands inviting you to surrender your password and download executable code to exploit your Mac. <code>curl</code> isn’t intended to allow malware to arrive without being put into quarantine. And ad hoc signatures aren’t intended to allow that malicious code to be executed.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s appropriate that Marek’s disease is chicken herpes.</p>

	Nice one, right, beauty! What a way to celebrate the 25th anniversary of GTA, even though I am a day late to the celebration, having all three games remastered on such a day is nothing short of respect. This version may even rival the MAX PACK by Toshiba-3. I have not played all the way through this version of the 2D trilogy, but it all looked good to me from the outside and among the few things I messed around with in-game. I love the CRT filter you added and combined with the aspect ratio option makes for a nostalgic joyride, I am not sure what to think about the other filters. Bilinear, scanline, fast-sharpen, and xbr-lv2-noblend are the only ones I noticed any real differences on. Albeit small, they made a difference in comparison to the other filters on this list where I saw little to no effect at all, although that could just be my laptop acting funny. Something I noticed about London 1969 and 1961 is that both have scores from previous games, I think you may have forgotten to fix that, but it is not really a big deal breaker. There are some suggestions I would like to add to improve the experience, I'll leave the glitch hunting to others or when I eventually get back into the spirit of the game.
</p>



<p>
	<strong>Quick edit:</strong> There's only two languages at the moment, hope to see support for other languages in an update. Also, what does the German flag icon at the upper right do?
</p>

<div>
	
	<p><strong>HUD needs an update: </strong>Don't get me wrong, I like the HUD, it gives off a typical 90's or 2000's vibes just from the way it looks alone. But the background picture looks rushed and somewhat bland along with the very few options you are allowed to choose from. I think the HUD could use a small update for both the options and the picture itself, along with an option to play the game separately with their own unique menus and backgrounds to match the game you choose. Also, for some reason, there's two descriptions missing for the "Vsync" and "Aspect ratio" option when I tried to hover my mouse over them. One option that definitely needs to be included is the "Controls" menu, I know you could just look inside the folders and change the controls from there but a quick click on the HUD instead navigating the folders would be nice. I guess you could also include having the 2D GTA maps as an option, but I'm sure most people know how to do a quick search and find them on Bing or Google so this is not really a priority, although it would be nice.</p><p>
	
	<strong>3DFX &amp; Low Color Mode:&nbsp;</strong>This one may be a stretch and probably impossible to include seeing as this is running on the Windows version of 2D GTA games, but it would be nice to play with these options. I know there is not really any real reason to play with these versions and I do not have a good argument to justify their inclusion should they be implemented aside from low color's different graphics and possibly better framerate. I guess that's more up to you as I feel this package is overall solid.
</p></div>

<p>
	<br>
	That is all I could really offer as suggestions and from what I have noticed outside the games. I do not want to come off as ungrateful or as whiny for this port, I am not, thanks to your contribution the game runs better and plays better. Not to mention, the multiplayer is much more accessible and less of a headache to set up than the MAX PACK version which required a few you to do some outside programming to even do. So again, you have my and the thanks of everyone in the GTA community.
</p>

<div><p>I love making games, and I’ve been building a no-code game engine by extracting reusable components every time I ship a new game. It started as me scratching my own itch, and now it’s turning into a real platform.</p><p>Each game adds more building blocks to the editor: multiplayer, event systems, NPC behaviors, pathfinding, etc. I build a system once, and then anyone using the editor can use it in a click.
For game logic, I recently added a visual event system I’m really excited about. It’s kind of like Unreal Blueprints, but focused on 2D. You pick a trigger, wire conditions, and chain actions in a node graph [1].</p><p>Big challenge right now: most people who want to make games needs assets, and don't know how to get/make them. So I’m building a marketplace where pixel artists can upload tilesets/characters, and unlike itch.io, assets are usable directly inside the engine. No ZIP downloads or import setup, just browse and drop into your game. A preview here[2].</p><p>Also, if you want to use the editor but ship elsewhere, you can export terrain, animations, and hitboxes to Godot 4.

<div><p>I’ve been experimenting with a live win probability predictor for the 10-player arcade game Killer Queen. The goal is to predict the winner in a causal, event-by-event fashion.</p><p>Right now I’m struggling to beat a baseline LightGBM model trained on hand-engineered expert features. My attempts at using a win probability head on top of nanoGPT, treating events as tokens, have been significantly worse. I am seeing about 65% accuracy compared to the LightGBM’s 70%. That 5% gap is huge given how stochastic the early game is, and the Transformer is easily 4 OOM more expensive to train.</p><p>To bridge the gap, I’m moving to a hybrid approach. I’m feeding those expert features back in as additional tokens or auxiliary loss heads, and I am using the LightGBM model as a teacher for knowledge distillation to provide smoother gradients.</p><p>The main priority here is personalized post-game feedback. By tracking sharp swings in win probability, or $\Delta WP$, you can automatically generate high or low-light reels right after a match. It helps players see the exact moment a play was either effective or catastrophic.</p><p>There is also a clear application for automated content creation. You can use $\Delta WP$ as a heuristic to identify the actual turning points of a match for YouTube summaries without needing to manually scrub through hours of Twitch footage.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46941719"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46941719" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46941719&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46937696"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>So for my tool, I really need the live UI mockup without having to export first to tweak the colors until they work (e.g. often the off-white/very-light colors used for backgrounds are too vibrant otherwise), the control-point based curve editing helps to explore hue/saturation/lightness curves around a brand color without a lot of clicking, and I want the option for palettes where each color scale follows the same steps in lightness (for predictable contrast between steps from different color scales).</p><p>Barely any designers I work with know about P3 colors (feels like P3 mostly appeals to developers right now, for programmatic reasons?), so I'm not that interested in P3 if it means using OKLCH with its intimidating looking color picker. My tool uses HSLuv, which looks familiar like an HSL color picker, where unlike HSL only the lightness slider alters the WCAG contrast, so HSLuv (while limited to sRGB) is great for exploring accessible colors.</p><p>I've actually got support for APCA, but I find many struggle understanding WCAG contrast requirements already. There's Figma export too.</p><p>Anyway, there's lots of overlap between different color tools but the small details are important for different workflows and needs. I've started to realise too that most designers need a lot of introduction into building (accessible) color palettes in general so it's a tricky puzzle between adding features and trying to keep it simple, which is why I'm very open to suggestions!</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46940837"><td></td></tr><tr id="46940857"><td></td></tr><tr id="46940891"><td></td></tr><tr id="46941721"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46941721" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46941721&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46937696"></a></center></td><td><br>

So for this passion project I intend to make it as accurate as it could ever be without having to emulate actual Windows 98.</p><p>Currently it has:</p><p>- Accurate recreation of Windows shell with start menu, taskbar, windowing system.</p><p>- Full desktop themes customization (color, cursor, sound, wallpaper, screensaver). All Win 98 default Plus! themes are included.</p><p>- Persistent local file system &amp; mounting local folder as removable disk with ZenFS.</p><p>- Support playing Flash games and run DOS games (save game persisted).

<div><p>Working on Memory Store: persistent, shared memory for all your AI agents.</p><p><a href="https://memory.store/" rel="nofollow">https://memory.store</a></p><p>The problem: if you use multiple AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, etc.), none of them know what the others know. You end up maintaining .md files, pasting context between chats, and re-explaining your project every time you start a new conversation. Power users spend more time briefing their agents than doing actual work.</p><p>Memory Store is an MCP server that ingests context from your workplace tools (Slack, email, calendar) and makes it available to any MCP-compatible agent. Make a decision in one tool, the others know. Project status changes, every agent is up to date.</p><p>We ran 35 in-depth user interviews and surveyed 90 people before writing a line of product code — 95% had already built workarounds for this problem (custom GPTs, claude.md templates, copy-paste workflows). The pain is real and people are already investing effort to solve it badly.</p><p>Early users are telling us things like one founder who tracked investor conversations through Memory Store and estimated talking to 4-5x more people because his agents could draft contextual replies without manual briefing. It helped close his round.</p><p>Live in beta now.

<div><p>I've just started a new personal project, a C++20 library for running composable visitors over data documents and data models with JSON/CBOR semantics, DOM-less.</p><p>Basically, if you define a data model with bindings, you can inject  data into it or extract data from it by running SAX-style visitors. You can use serializers/deserializers for standard formats like JSON/BSON/CBOR/CSV, or you can define custom formats for formating structured data however you want to. You can also run a serializer visitor on a deserializer to convert between formats. You can compose filter visitors to extract a subtree or filter out keys. And it's designed to fit on microcontrollers with very limited dynamic memory allocations, because it either streams data on-the-fly or works directly with the underlying data format in a big preallocated buffer.</p><p>I worked with libraries that offered a subset of these features before in my professional career (even built one myself), but recently I've had an epiphany (a document can also be used as a data model) that makes me think I can create something elegant and unique.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46941759"><td></td></tr><tr id="46940999"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46940999" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46940999&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46937696"></a></center></td><td><br>

rtk acts as a CLI wrapper/filter to make LLM interactions more signal-to-noise efficient. It silences or summarizes redundant outputs so the agent only receives the necessary "delta."

<div><p>I’m building an app that facilitates discovery and eases payments for roadside stands that sell produce, honey, maple syrup, eggs, firewood, crafts, etc. The concept is that any roadside vendor can sign up for free (forever, no add-ons or upsells) and they have an online home for their home business. The vendor can list up to 3 stands and show off the products they sell in each stand. Users can discover stands near them by list, search, or map, view the vendor and stand details, ratings, payment methods accepted, etc. When arriving at a stand the user can scan a QR code which opens a web cart, allowing them to add products they are going to purchase and then “check out” using one of the vendor’s stated payment methods like Venmo, CashApp, PayPal, Apple Cash, Zelle, or good old hard currency. We make these payments easier by standardizing the check out experience but we do not facilitate payments at all - these stands have always been and will continue to be self-serve on the honor system. Once you’ve paid, you get a receipt and take your goods. The vendor gets an alert that a sale intent was started and by which method so they know where to look for their revenue. In the future we may help with some basic reporting and very light inventory management if vendors ask for it. We allow users to alert the vendor if a stand is out of stock, which is also reflected in search so other users are informed as well. Users can then ask to receive re-stock alerts as the vendor restocks. 
Then of course users can favorite stands and products, share them, rate them, and create shareable collections of stands they curate (The Honey Trail or Summer Sweet Corn All-Stars, etc.). Eventually we will be adapted for events like farmer’s markets, craft fairs, and christmas markets. 
I built this because I am a maple syrup producer (tapping starts in a few short weeks from now) and I’m starting to get into mass sales of my syrup. I felt like people who produce and sell these products put a lot of hard work into the process and deserve a legit discovery tool as well as a basic stand management system that does not make them change their process or get in their way. An app like this costs basically nothing to run and I will ensure it is free to use as long as I am in charge. I’m testing this week and likely soft-launching in the next couple weeks - the goal is to be online around March 1. 
It was just going to be web-only (Supabase with a Svelte front end) but after Claude put me in timeout last week I tried Antigravity and now have 80% of an iOS app and will scaffold my Android app in the next month - so native apps will follow a web release pretty quickly.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46941491"><td></td></tr><tr id="46940603"><td></td></tr><tr id="46941371"><td></td></tr><tr id="46939726"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46939726" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46939726&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46937696"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>The past few weeks I've been building Blackbird</p><p><a href="https://github.com/jbonatakis/blackbird" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/jbonatakis/blackbird</a></p><p>At a high level it's my take on how the execution aspect of spec-driven development should be handled. Where as most tools that are popular right now break a spec down into a task list and instruct your agent to work through it in a single session, I am treating agents as stateless. By this I mean a separate (headless) session is started with selected context for each task. This avoids context exhaustion, compaction (and the resulting confusion that can occur), and means that Blackbird can work through effectively an arbitrarily large task list.</p><p>Right now it's BYO-spec, but then it:</p><p>* breaks the spec down into a dependent-aware plan (DAG) composed of parent and child tasks</p><p>* executes tasks one at a time based on their status (ready to execute if all dependencies are marked as completed)</p><p>* allows you to (optionally) pause execution after each task to review, approve and continue, approve and quit, or reject the changes altogether</p><p>* (soon) treats parent tasks as an automated reviewer for all child tasks and optionally auto-resume those sessions to address the feedback</p><p>* and more</p><p>It's entirely bootstrapped, and so far I'm quite pleased with it. I also wrote a post[1] today about some of the concepts I had in mind as I was defining the architecture.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://jack.bonatak.is/blah/killer-context/" rel="nofollow">https://jack.bonatak.is/blah/killer-context/</a></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46940627"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46940627" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46940627&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46937696"></a></center></td><td><br>

Right now it has only one agent that can be run on an email to extract regex patterns for financial data. This enables high performance data extraction from emails or documents (in future) without sending each email to an LLM.</p><p>dwata has an email scan which tests simple keywords and regex patterns, groups by sender emails, sorts by number of emails per sender (highest first), and filters out groups where the emails do not seem to be from a template (typical transaction emails are from templates). This is deterministic code in Rust. Then dwata can use the regex builder AI agent to take one email from the group and build a regex pattern to extract extensive financial data - (optional) who sent, how much, (optional) to whom, on which date, with (optional) reference ID.</p><p>The generated patterns are saved to local DB and run for the email group (by sender) which was used to generate the regex. That gives a very high performance, AI enabled financial data extractor.</p><p>Soon, I will focus on events, places, people, tasks, health and other data. All data storage and processing is local. I am testing exclusively with Google Gemini 3 Flash Preview but dwata should be able to run really well on small LLMs, ones up to 20b parameters.</p><p>I am preparing for launch, the builds are not ready yet, but if you want to try, you can compile (Rust and npm tooling needed).

<div><p>I'm thinking all the time about what the "best" way of using local AI agents like Claude / Codex / Gemini is. I'm trying to figure out the best UI/UX. There's so so so much that hasn't been explored yet.</p><p>Mainly I'm working on a task dispatch dashboard called Prompter Hawk that is designed to be the best UI for task management with agents. If you've been trying to parallelize by running multiple claude code terminals or codex terminals at once, this tool replaces those terminals and fits them all into one view with an AI task tracking board. It sounds more complicated than it is. It's a harness for Claude / Gemini / GPT models with a GUI that speeds up all your workflows. Rather than using sustained chat mode, all Prompter Hawk tasks are fire-and-forget. You just give the task description and come back when it's done. Parallelism first.</p><p>Some example highlight features:</p><p>-One dashboard view that shows all your parallel sessions and which tasks each agent has in progress and in their queue. Also shows recently completed tasks and outputs. This is my attempt at the ideal "pilot's cockpit view" for agentic development.</p><p>-Tasks are well tracked by the manager: see their status, file changes, and git commits. One click task retry. Get breakdowns on cost per run. Tasks can be set to automatically recur on a given schedule. Everything goes into a persistent local DB so you can easily pull up task data from months ago. Far far better user experience than trying to pull up old chat histories IMO.</p><p>-Timeline view and analytics views that give you hard stats on your velocity and how effectively your agents are using and updating your codebase. See unique stats like which of your files your agents read the most and how many daily LOC and commit changes you're doing. See how well you're parallelizing workloads at a simple glance.</p><p>-Automatic system diagram generation</p><p>-Task suggestion feature. If your agents are idle, they can draft tentative tasks to carry out next, based on the project history and your goals. This makes keeping multiple agents spinning actually much easier than you'd think. You don't need to be a multitasking context-switching god to do this.</p><p>I haven't shared it much (not even a Show HN) because the landing page isn't converting well at all yet, though I have some reddit ads doing well. I've had a bunch of free users sign up and a handful of paying users too. Looking for users or just feedback on anything!

<div><p>With a bit of tuning, you can get models like Claude to output Mermaid-style diagrams. I built this as a feature into the tasks, so that you can hit a toggle which adds a prompt asking the agent to create a Mermaid diagram during or after the task execution. I pull this diagram back into the GUI and display it with the task information. So user flow is like:</p><p>-User creates task as usual but toggles the "mermaid diagram" option on</p><p>-Agent takes additional step during execution to create diagram</p><p>-User sees that diagram on the task details panel for that task</p><p>If you specify in your overall task prompt what kind of diagram you want or what you want it to show, it will take your specifications into account. It's just a prompt control + automatically pulling that diagram back into the task tracking.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46939467"><td></td></tr><tr id="46939775"><td></td></tr><tr id="46939880"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46939880" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46939880&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46937696"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>An alternative client for Bambu 3D printers that plays nicely with network sandboxing and multiple printers. It's great.</p><p>Bambu's printers are functionally best-in-class, but intrusive and proprietary in their approach to software. Their first-time setup "requires" linking to a cloud account or using a bambu app via QR code, and they've been known to disable functionality in updates, making a device-managed "LAN-only" mode unsafe to trust. Their apps also just suck. Camera feed is janky and LAN-only sync often requires knowing an access code, serial, IP, and then it fails most of the time anyway, silently, without saving values to retry. And that's before you start doing things like a custom VLAN/SSID to properly wall them off, at which point you can ping them from terminal but the apps break completely.</p><p>Anyway, turns out that at least on A1 and P1S, there's enough functionality available through traditional means to skip the apps entirely. The handshake works fine across VLANs and utils like print status, file upload, and auto-start are available. Even the camera is reliable when pulled as a series of still images.</p><p>I had opus vibe out a replacement front end that gives me a simple upload and monitor UI for my A1, and it just kept hitting stretch goals. I added support for multiple printers so you can see them stacked on a single page and manage all of them from one place. And it even works on just-unboxed models that have never been through the official setup. SSID info on the SD card, it joins the network, immediately accessible via IP. Zero association/contact with any cloud or app, fully sandboxed/offline. Wrapped in a lil python launcher so I can run it from the dock instead of in the browser (just my preference).</p><p>Will probably open source it soon.</p><p>IMO this kind of thing is the answer to "what do you have to show for your LLM use". Cost was about $65 because I was using opus 4.6 with no regard for efficiency, and because there were multiple total refactors of two apps. An annoying problem I deal with almost every day now has a permanent, personalized solution that took me ~3 hours and would never have otherwise happened.</p><p>The network itself is also such a project. I previously hobbled together a working unifi setup, but it was primitive and brittle. With LLM guidance, I was able to build something much more robust. TrueNAS scale for file backup that also runs Frigate for POE cam mgmt (similarly sandboxed), raspi running the unifi controller, another for homeassistant, etc. Absolutely miserable few days getting that dialed, but now that we're out the other side, it's very nice. Reminds me of building the house. You suffer more upfront in exchange for something that fits you like a glove. Very rewarding.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46939731"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46939731" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46939731&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46937696"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I'm learning about "AI programming" by working on some toy problems, like an automated subtitle translator tool that can take both the existing English subtitles and a centre-weighted mono audio extracted from the video file and feed it to an AI.</p><p>My big takeaway lesson from this is that the APIs are clumsy, the frameworks are very rough, and we're still very much in the territory of having to roll your own bespoke solutions for everything instead of the whole thing "just working". For example:</p><p>Large file uploads are very inconsistent between providers. You get fun issues like a completed file upload being unusable because there's an extra "processing" step that you have to poll-wait for. (Surprise!)</p><p>The vendors all expose a "list models" API, none of which return a consistent and useful list of metadata.</p><p>Automatic context caching isn't.</p><p>Multi-modal inputs are still very "early days". Models are terrible at mixed-language input, multiple speakers, and also get confused by background noises, music, and singing.</p><p>You can tell an AI to translate the subtitles to language 'X', and it will.. most of the time. If you provide audio, it'll <i>get confused</i> and think that it is being asked to transcribe it! It'll return <i>new</i> English subtitles sometimes.</p><p>JSON schemas are a hint, not a constraint with some providers.</p><p>Some providers *cough*oogle*cough* don't support all JSON Schema constructs, so you can't safely use their API with arbitrary input types.</p><p>If you ask for a whole JSON document back, you'll get timeout errors.</p><p>If you stream your results, you have to handle reassembly and parsing yourself, the frameworks don't handle this scenario well yet.</p><p>You'd think a JSON list (JSONL) schema would be perfect for this scenario, but they're explicitly <i>not supported</i> by some providers!</p><p>Speaking of failures, you also get refusals and other <i>undocumented</i> errors you'll only discover in production. If you're maintaining a history or sliding window of context, you have to carefully maintain snapshots so you can roll back and retry. With most APIs you don't even know if the error was a temporary or permanent condition, of if your retry loop is eating into your budget or not.</p><p>Context size management is extra fun now that none of the mainstream models provide their tokenizer to use offline. Sometimes the input will fit into the context, sometimes it won't. You have to back off and retry with various heuristics that are problem-specific.</p><p>Ironically, the APIs are <i>so new</i> and undergoing so much churn that the AI models know nothing about them. And anyway, how could they? None of them are properly documented! Google <i>just</i> rewrote everything into the new "GenAI" SDK and OpenAI has a "Responses" API which is different from their "Chat" API... I don't know how. It just is.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46939724"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46939724" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46939724&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46937696"></a></center></td><td><br>

<li>The Changan Nevo A06 is the world's first mass-produced car powered by a sodium-ion battery.</li>
<li>It has a CLTC range of about 250 miles and can run with little to no range loss even in -40 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
<li>It's the start of a new "dual chemistry era," CATL said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>​Chinese battery giant CATL and automaker Changan Automobile are preparing to put the world’s first passenger car powered by sodium-ion batteries on public roads by mid-2026. And if the launch is successful, it could usher in an era where electric vehicles present less of a fire risk and can better handle extreme temperatures.&nbsp;<br>​<br>The <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/757347/catl-sodium-ion-ev-battery-loves-cold/" data-inline-widget="internal-links" data-type-id="0" data-params="%7B%22article_edition_id%22%3A%22757347%22%2C%22section%22%3A%221%22%2C%22alias%22%3A%22catl-sodium-ion-ev-battery-loves-cold%22%7D">CATL Naxtra sodium-ion battery</a> will debut in the Changan Nevo A06 sedan, delivering an estimated range of around 400 kilometers (249 miles) on the China Light-Duty Test Cycle. From there, the battery will roll out across Changan’s broader portfolio, including EVs from Avatr, Deepal, Qiyuan and Uni, the company said.</p>
<p>​“The launch represents a major step in the industry’s transition toward a dual-chemistry ecosystem, where sodium-ion and lithium-ion batteries complement each other to meet diverse customer needs,” CATL said in a press release.</p>

</section>
<p>It’s a meaningful step forward for the technology that’s rapidly emerging as an alternative to lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, which currently dominate China’s EV market. <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/699010/are-sodium-ion-batteries-dead-on-arrival/" data-inline-widget="internal-links" data-type-id="0" data-params="%7B%22article_edition_id%22%3A%22699010%22%2C%22section%22%3A%221%22%2C%22alias%22%3A%22are-sodium-ion-batteries-dead-on-arrival%22%7D">Studies</a> show that sodium-ion batteries carry no risk of thermal runaway and are far less sensitive to extreme temperatures. Above all, sodium is significantly cheaper and far more abundant than lithium.</p>
<p>​From an energy density standpoint, the Naxtra battery is competitive but not revolutionary. It delivers 175 watt-hours per kilogram of energy density, which is lower than nickel-rich chemistries but roughly on par with LFP. That makes it more suitable for low-cost and low-range EVs as well as stationary energy storage.<br>​<br>By using a cell-to-pack design, where individual cells are integrated directly into the battery pack instead of modules, CATL was able to extract 400 kilometers (249 miles) of range on the CTLC cycle.</p>

<p>But CATL says there’s plenty of room for improvement on the range front. As the sodium-ion supply chain matures, the company expects EV range to climb to 600 kilometers (373 miles), while extended-range EVs (EREVs) and hybrids could reach up to 400 kilometers (249 miles). That would cover more than half of the typical range requirements in China’s EV market, CATL claims.<br>​<br>Where the Naxtra battery really stands out, however, is cold-weather performance. CATL says its discharge power at -30 degrees Celsius (-22 degrees Fahrenheit) is three times higher than that of LFP batteries.</p>
<p>Unlike LFP or nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) packs, it reportedly avoids severe winter range loss, retaining more than 90% of its range at -40 degrees C (-40 degrees F). Power delivery is also said to remain stable at temperatures as low as -50 degrees C (-58 degrees F).</p>

<p>As always, we’ll have to wait for independent testing for real-world results. But on paper, the technology looks genuinely compelling. While the Naxtra battery isn’t coming to the U.S., it could be especially valuable in places like the Midwest and the Northeast, where EV drivers routinely report <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/786332/tesla-model-3-deep-freeze-night-charge-efficiency/" data-inline-widget="internal-links" data-type-id="0" data-params="%7B%22article_edition_id%22%3A%22786332%22%2C%22section%22%3A%221%22%2C%22alias%22%3A%22tesla-model-3-deep-freeze-night-charge-efficiency%22%7D">steep range losses when temperatures plunge in winter</a>.<br>​<br>While lithium-ion batteries aren’t going anywhere, it’s becoming increasingly clear that the future of EVs will be defined by multiple battery chemistries coexisting. That’s how internal combustion engines evolved over the years, giving drivers more options to be able to choose the battery technology that best fits their driving habits, power needs—and the climate they live in.</p>

<p>Let's compile Quake like it's 1997!</p><hr>
 

<p>The first batches of <i>Quake</i> executables, <code>quake.exe</code> and <code>vquake.exe</code> were programmed on HP 712-60 running NeXT and cross-compiled with DJGPP running on a DEC Alpha server 2100A. In June of 1996, having shipped their title but concerned with NeXT stagnation, id Software switched their development stack.</p>

<blockquote>
We moved to Intergraph hardware running Windows NT right after shipping Quake.<p>- John Carmack<a name="back_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>


<p>The next versions of <i>Quake</i>, <code>winquake.exe</code>, <code>glquake.exe</code>, and <i>QuakeWorld</i> (<code>qwcl.exe</code> and <code>qwsv.exe</code>) were all developed and compiled on Windows NT with Visual C++ 4.X.</p>

<p>This article describes the steps to re-create the experience of building the win32 binaries of Quake as it happened in 1997.</p>

<p>The purist's corner</p><hr><p>Depending on the level of historical accuracy you want to reach, you can follow the steps with four environments.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Find an Intergraph RealizM Dual P6-200MHz workstation (good luck).</li>
  <li>Find a dual Pentium Pro machine (good luck again but finding a W6-LI is doable).</li>
  <li>Use a regular late 90's PC like the <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/quake_pc">Quake PC</a>.</li>
  <li>Download Oracle's Virtualbox and create a VM.</li>
</ul>

<p>I tested these steps both on the Quake PC and in Virtualbox, running either Windows 98SE or Windows NT 4.0.</p>

<p>Installing Windows NT 4</p><hr><p>Installing Windows NT 4 is pretty easy since the CD is bootable. Installation took 30 minutes.</p>





<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/windows_NT_4_startup.webp"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/windows_NT_4_startup.webp" width="1600" height="1200"></a>
<p>I love how minimalist Windows NT startup screen is. It proudly displayed how many CPUs are detected (Windows 95/98 only supports one CPU) and how much RAM is there. There is no silly animation.</p>

<p>Adding a second CPU to a system won't be automatically detected by Windows NT. You need to re-install to get the HAL handling SMP systems. The same thing goes with dual CPU motherboard. On a W6-LI, one need not only to add another Pentium Pro but also a regulator!</p>

<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/windows_NT_4.webp"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/windows_NT_4.webp" width="1024" height="768"></a>
<p>Windows NT 4 uses the same UI theme as Windows 9X. The first release, Windows NT 3 used the same UI elements as Windows 3.1. It <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/windowsnt3.1.png">looked</a> <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/Winnt31.webp">awful</a>.</p>




<p>Installing Visual C++ 6</p><hr><p>The Win32 version of Quake were coded on Visual C++ 4.X since it was the most recent version of Microsoft IDE available in mid-96. However, by 1999, the project had been migrated to Visual C++ 6. If you don't have the CD handily available, you can likely find it on the Internet Archive or winworldpc.com.</p>


<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/1.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/1.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a>
<p>In a time before "always on" Internet, most software had a product ID to fight piracy.</p>
<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/2.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/2.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a>
<p>The installation screen also brings up the next "Visual Studio", combining many development environments. It would soon become THE Microsoft IDE to rule them all.</p>
<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/3.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/3.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a>
<p>The installation screen looks off. There is a lot of empty space and the progress bar is awkwardly placed. That is because Microsoft did not expect this to run at the crazy high resolution of 1280x1024 (which id developers likely used on their 21" monitors). It only looks as intended in 640x480 or 800x600.</p>
<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/4.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/4.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a>

<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/5.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/5.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a>
<p>With VC++6 installed, we now need to get the source code. DO NOT get it from github or transfer the files via FTP. This will mess up the workspace <code>.dsw</code> file. Then VC++6 will be unable to parse it. And it won't even give you an error message, it will just open and show no file / project associated. And you will lose 1/2 a day trying to debug the problem.</p>

<p>Instead, you need to get <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/q1source.zip">q1source.zip</a>. It used to be available on id Software's FTP server but now you can get it from the awesome <i>Quake Official Archive</i> maintained by Jason Brownless<a name="back_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.</p>


<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/6.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/6.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a>
<p>With a VM you can transfer files via drag/drop. Alternatively you can use <i>Quick ‘n Easy FTP Server</i> which works on both 9X/NT.</p>

<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/7.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/7.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a><p>To decompress <code>q1source.zip</code>, you will need WinRar. The v2.50 still works well on 9X/NT.</p>


<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/8.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/8.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a>
<p>Now launch VC++6. Select "Open Workspace" then pick "WinQuake.dsw".</p>

<p>Modern versions of Visual Studio use .sln (Solution) and .vcxproj but Visual C++ 6 uses .dsp and .dsw. The dsp contains a single project while the dsw is a workspace pointing to dsp projects.</p>

<p>Start the build with "Rebuild All"</p>

<p>The build will fail because VC6++ was unable to assemble all the <code>.s</code> files which contain the hand-optimized assembly by Michael Abrash.</p>
<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/11.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/11.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a>

<p>The assembler comes with VC++6 Processor Pack (vcpp5.exe).</p>
<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/12.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/12.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a>
<p>Of course, launching setupsp5.exe to install it will fail. This is because you need to install MDAC 2.5 first.</p> 
  <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/13.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/13.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a>

<p> Don't lose an hour trying to download MDAC from somewhere. You just need to run acmsetup.exe which is in the same folder created when vs6spp5.exe decompressed itself.</p>

<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/14.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/14.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a>
<p>Now go back and run setupsp5.exe. This time it will work. By now it should feel like you are following the solution of Monkey Island. Nothing makes sense. We are definitely deeeep into the 90s.</p>
<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/15.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/15.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a>
<p>More awkwardly small progress bar but this is still progress.</p>
<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/16.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/16.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a>
<p>Re-open the project with VC++6 and run "Rebuild All " again. This time it should work.</p>
<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/17.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/17.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a>
<p>Yup! Enjoy! You can even build/run <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/quakeworld">QuakeWorld</a> and it works with QSpy!</p>
<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/19.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/compile_like_1997/19.png" width="1280" height="1024"></a>
<p>A darn good IDE</p><hr><p>VC++6 is remarkably powerful for 1996. It has features such as "Go to definition", breakpoints, stacktrace, and variable inspections (but no Intellisense auto-completion yet). I never used it but it must have felt like a dream at the time.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="issue-body-viewer" data-team-hovercards-enabled="true" data-turbolinks="false" id="issue-body-viewer"><h2 dir="auto">Summary</h2>
<p dir="auto">It's possible in Copilot to bypass any billing / 'premium request' usage by taking advantage of:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Subagents and tool calls not consuming any 'requests'.</li>
<li>Request cost being calculated on the initial model used.</li>
<li>"Free" models incl. in Copilot e.g. GPT-5-mini, GPT-4.1 etc.</li>
<li>Ability to define an agent for a subagent.</li>
<li>Ability to specify a model for an agent.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Combining these correctly results in 'free' and almost unlimited, usage of expensive premium models like Opus 4.5 which would usually cost '3 premium requests':</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Instructions</h2>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Start a new Chat.</li>
<li>Set the model to a "free" model, included in Copilot e.g. GPT-5 Mini.</li>
<li>Create an agent, and set it's model to a premium model, e.g. Opus 4.5</li>
<li>Set the mode to "agent".</li>
<li>In the initial message, instruct it to launch an agent '[your_agents_name_here]' as a subagent using the runSubagent tool, and to pass on the following query e.g. "What time is it in London, UK".</li>
<li>Submit the message.</li>
<li>The initial request will be picked up by the free GPT-5 Mini model, incurring no fees.</li>
<li>The free model will create a subagent (which is also free)</li>
<li>The free subagent will launch with an 'agent' profile, this profile has the model set to a premium model</li>
<li>The premium model will be used for the subagent - but premium requests will be consumed.</li>
</ol>

<USER_REQUEST_RULES>
- You can call the 'subagent' defined in 'USER_REQUEST_INSTRUCTIONS' as many times as needed to fulfill the user's request.
- It's recommended you use the subagent to help you decide how best to respond and/or complete the task (because it is a larger model than you) including how best to break the task down into smaller steps if needed.
- Use the subagent for all todos/tasks/queries, do not perform any task or respond to any query yourself, you are just an orchestrator.
- Do not manipulate/summarize subagent responses to save on tokens, always be comprehensive and verbose.
- Do not evaluate or respond to the remainder of this message, the subagent is responsible for all further content.

<p dir="auto">Another vector for abuse - albeit requiring more effort is:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Set <code>chat.agent.maxRequests</code> to a high value.</li>
<li>Use a premium model e.g. Opus 4.5 as the initial model for the chat session.</li>
<li>Build a custom script (not disclosed for safety), that you tell the model to call as part of a tool invocation.</li>
<li>Craft some prompts to direct the model to repeat the tool call(s).</li>
<li>The right script, with the right prompts can be tailored to create a loop, allowing the premium model to continually be invoked unlimited times for no additional cost beyond that of the initial message. </li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In my testing I had a single message result in a 3hr+ process that launched hundreds of Opus 4.5 subagents to process hundreds of files - and only consumed 3 premium credits. Had I not stopped it at 3hrs, it would have continued.</p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Related</strong>: I also noted the message 'types' are being declared on the client, inferring no API validation e.g: <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-chat/blob/main/src/extension/intents/node/toolCallingLoop.ts#L484">https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-chat/blob/main/src/extension/intents/node/toolCallingLoop.ts#L484</a></p>
<p dir="auto">I believe this is another vector that allows for more blatant abuse directly against the API.</p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong>: Initially submitted this to MSRC (VULN-172488), MSRC insisted bypassing billing is outside of MSRC scope and instructed me multiple times to file as a public bug report.</p>

        <strong>
          Background &amp; aims:
        </strong>
      
      Early-onset dementia (EOD, defined as diagnosis &lt; age 65) imposes a high socio-economic burden. It is less prevalent and less investigated than late-onset dementia (LOD). Observational data indicate that many EOD cases are associated with potentially modifiable risk factors, yet the relationship between diet and EOD has been under-explored. Omega-3 fatty acids are promising dietary factors for dementia prevention; however, existing research has primarily focused on cohorts aged &gt;65. We examined the associations between omega-3 blood levels (which objectively reflect dietary intake) and incident EOD by leveraging data from the UK Biobank cohort.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Methods:
        </strong>
      
      We included participants aged 40-64, free of dementia at baseline and for whom plasma omega-3 levels and relevant covariates were available. We modeled the relationships between the three omega-3 exposures (total omega-3, DHA, and non-DHA omega-3) and incident EOD with quintiles (Q) and continuous linear relationships. We constructed Cox proportional hazards adjusting for sex, age at baseline and APOE-ε4 allele load, besides other lifestyle variables reported to relate to incident EOD. We also assessed the interaction between each exposure of interest and APOE-ε4 allele load.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Results:
        </strong>
      
      The study included 217,122 participants. During the mean follow-up of 8.3 years, 325 incident EOD cases were ascertained. Compared to participants at Q1 of total omega-3, those at Q4 and Q5 showed a statistically significantly lower risk of EOD (Q4, hazard ratio [95 % confidence interval] = 0.62 [0.43, 0.89]; Q5, 0.60 [0.42, 0.86]). A statistically significant inverse association was also observed for total omega-3 as a continuous variable. Compared to participants at Q1 of DHA, those at Q5 of non-DHA showed a significant lower risk of EOD. A statistically significant lower risk was observed in Q3, Q4 and Q5 of non-DHA omega-3. Finally, we observed no evidence of interaction omega-3 × APOE-ε4 allele load.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Conclusions:
        </strong>
      
      This study expands the evidence of a beneficial association of omega-3 and LOD to EOD as well. These findings suggest that an increased intake of omega-3 fatty acids earlier in life may slow the development of EOD. Additional research is needed to confirm our findings, particularly in more diverse populations.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Vouch</h2><a id="user-content-vouch" aria-label="Permalink: Vouch" href="#vouch"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">A project trust management system. People must be <strong>vouched for</strong> before
interacting with certain parts of a project (the exact parts are
configurable to the project to enforce). People can also be explicitly
<strong>denounced</strong> to block them from interacting with the project.</p>
<p dir="auto">The implementation is generic and can be used by any project on any code forge,
but we provide <strong>GitHub integration</strong> out of the box via GitHub actions
and the CLI.</p>
<p dir="auto">The vouch list is maintained in a single flat file using a minimal format
that can be trivially parsed using standard POSIX tools and any programming
language without external libraries.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Vouch lists can also form a web of trust.</strong> You can configure Vouch to
read other project's lists of vouched or denounced users. This way,
projects with shared values can share their trust decisions with each other
and create a larger, more comprehensive web of trust across the ecosystem.
Users already proven to be trustworthy in one project can automatically
be assumed trustworthy in another project, and so on.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Warning</p>
<p dir="auto">This is an experimental system in use by <a href="https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty">Ghostty</a>.
We'll continue to improve the system based on experience and feedback.</p>
</div>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why?</h2><a id="user-content-why" aria-label="Permalink: Why?" href="#why"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Open source has always worked on a system of <em>trust and verify</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Historically, the effort required to understand a codebase, implement
a change, and submit that change for review was high enough that it
naturally filtered out many low quality contributions from unqualified people.
For over 20 years of my life, this was enough for my projects as well
as enough for most others.</p>
<p dir="auto">Unfortunately, the landscape has changed particularly with the advent
of AI tools that allow people to trivially create plausible-looking but
extremely low-quality contributions with little to no true understanding.
Contributors can no longer be trusted based on the minimal barrier to entry
to simply submit a change.</p>
<p dir="auto">But, open source still works on trust! And every project has a definite
group of trusted individuals (maintainers) and a larger group of probably
trusted individuals (active members of the community in any form). So,
let's move to an explicit trust model where trusted individuals can vouch
for others, and those vouched individuals can then contribute.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Who is Vouched?</h2><a id="user-content-who-is-vouched" aria-label="Permalink: Who is Vouched?" href="#who-is-vouched"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Who</strong> and <strong>how</strong> someone is vouched or denounced is left entirely up to the
project integrating the system. Additionally, <strong>what</strong> consequences
a vouched or denounced person has is also fully up to the project.
Implement a policy that works for your project and community.</p>

<p dir="auto">Integrating vouch into a GitHub project is easy with the
<a href="https://github.com/mitchellh/vouch/tree/main/action">provided GitHub Actions</a>.
By choosing which actions to use, you can fully control how
users are vouched and what they can or can't do.</p>
<p dir="auto">For an example, look at this repository! It fully integrates vouch.</p>
<p dir="auto">Below is a list of the actions and a brief description of their function.

<p dir="auto"><strong>What is <code>.td</code>?</strong> This stands for "Trustdown," a play on the
word "Markdown." I intend to formalize a specification for trust
lists (with no opinion on how they're created or used) so that software
systems like this Vouch project and others can coordinate with each
other. I'm not ready to publish a specification until vouch itself
stabilizes usage more.</p>

<h3 id="early-lookdev">Early lookdev</h3>
<p>Before really diving into this project, I experimented with the look in Blender to see if it would even look good. IMO it did, so I went ahead with it!</p>
<p>I experimented with a "pseudo-dither" on the Blender monkey by adding a small random vector to each normal.</p>

<h3 id="blender-to-normal-map-workflow">Blender to normal map workflow</h3>
<p>tl;dr: Cryptomattes and custom shaders to adjust normal maps</p>
<p>It doesn't really matter what software I used to produce the normal maps. Blender was the path of least resistance for me, so I chose that.</p>
<p>For the teapot, I simply put in a teapot, rotated a camera around it, and exported the normal AOV as a PNG sequence. Pretty straight-forward.</p>
<p>For the spinning Game Boy Color, I wanted to ensure that certain colors were solid, so I used cryptomattes in the compositor to identify specific geometry and output hard-coded values in the output.</p>
<p>The geometry in the screen was done by rendering a separate scene, then compositing it in the final render using a cryptomatte for the screen.</p>

<p><em>The above animations are normal map frames that are used to solve the value of each pixel</em></p>
<p>Normal maps are a core concept of this project. They're already used everywhere in 3D graphics.</p>
<p><strong>And indeed, normal map images are secretly a vector field</strong>. The reason normal maps tend to have a blue-ish baseline color, is because everyone likes to associate XYZ with RGB, and +Z is the forward vector by convention.</p>
<p>In a typical 3D workflow, a normal map is used to encode the normal vector at any given point on a textured mesh.</p>

<p>The simplest way to shade a 3D object is using the dot product:</p>

<p>When the light vector is constant for all pixels, it models what most 3D graphics software calls a "distant light", or a "sun light".</p>
<h3 id="spherical-coordinates">Spherical Coordinates</h3>
<p>To speed up computation on the Game Boy, I use an alternate version of the dot product, using spherical coordinates.</p>
<p>A <strong>spherical coordinate</strong> is a point represented by a radius <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>r</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">r</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, a primary angle <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>θ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\theta</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> "theta", and a secondary angle <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>φ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\varphi</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> "phi".

<p>Because all normal vectors are unit length, and the light vector is unit length, we can just assume the radius <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>r</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">r</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> is equal to 1.

<p>And using the previous variable names, we get the formula:</p>

<p>This requires two lookups: a <code>log</code> lookup, and a <code>pow</code> lookup.</p>
<p>In pseudocode, multiplying 0.3 and 0.5 looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>pow</span> = [ ... ]              <span># A 256-entry lookup table</span>

<span># float_to_logspace() is compile-time. Accepts -1.0 to +1.0.</span>
<span># x and y are 8-bit values in log-space</span>
x = float_to_logspace(<span>0.3</span>) 
y = float_to_logspace(<span>0.5</span>)

result = <span>pow</span>[x + y]
</code></pre>
<p>One limitation of this is that it's not possible to take the log of a negative number. e.g. <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>log</mi><mo>⁡</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\log(-1)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> has no real solution.</p>
<p>We can overcome this by encoding a "sign" bit in the MSB of the log-space value. When adding two log-space values together, the sign bit is effectively XOR'd (toggled). We just need to ensure the remaining bits don't overflow into it. We ensure this by keeping the remaining bits small enough.</p>
<p>The <code>pow</code> lookup accounts for this bit and returns a positive or negative result based on it.</p>
<h3 id="all-scalars-and-lookups-are-8-bit-fractions">All scalars and lookups are 8-bit fractions</h3>
<p>It's advantageous to restrict numbers to a single byte, for both run-time performance and ROM size. 8-bit fractions are pretty extreme by today's standards, but believe it or not, it works. It's lossy as hell, but it works!</p>
<p>All scalars we're working with are between -1.0 and +1.0.</p>

<p>Addition and multiplication both use... addition!</p>
<p>Consider adding the two bytes: 5 + 10 = 15</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Why is the denominator 127 instead of 128? It's because I needed to represent both positive and negative 1. In a two's-complement encoding, signed positive 128 doesn't exist.</p>
<p>You might notice that the log-space values cycle and become negative at byte 128. The log-space values use bit 7 of the byte to encode the "sign" bit. As mentioned in the previous section, this is important for toggling the sign during multiplication.</p>
<p>The log-space values also use <span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mn>2</mn><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mn>6</mn></mfrac></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">2^{1 \over 6}</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> as a base, because I chose this as a sufficiently small base to meet the requirement that adding 3 of these log-space values won't overflow (42+42+42 = 126). Bytes 43 thru 127 are near 0, so in practice the ROM doesn't encode these values.</p>
<p>The lookup tables look like this:</p>

<p>Reconstructed functions look like this. The precision error is shown in the jagged "staircase" patterns:</p>

<h3 id="how-fast-is-it">How fast is it?</h3>
<p><strong>The procedure processes 15 tiles per frame</strong>. It can process more if some of the tile's rows are empty (all 0), but it's guaranteed to process at least 15.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.otterstack.com/posts/202512-gbshader/debugger_critical_loop_events.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="800" height="630"></p>
<p><em>Figure: Mesen's "Event Viewer" window, showing a dot for each iteration (tile row) of the shader's critical loop.</em></p>
<p>There's some intentional visual tearing as well. The image itself is more than 15 tiles, so the ROM actually switches to rendering different portions of the image for each frame. The tearing is less noticeable because of ghosting on the LCD display, so I thought it was acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>A pixel takes about 130 cycles, and an empty row's pixel takes about 3 cycles.</strong></p>
<p>At one point I had calculated 15 tiles rendering at exactly 123,972 cycles, including the call and branch overhead. This is an overestimate now, because I since added an optimization for empty rows.</p>
<p>The Game Boy Color's CPU runs up to 8.388608 MHz, or roughly 139,810 T-cycles per frame (1/60 of a second).</p>
<p><span><span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mn>123972</mn><mn>139810</mn></mfrac><mo>≈</mo><mn>89</mn><mi mathvariant="normal">%</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">{123972 \over 139810} \approx 89 \%</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>
About 89% of a frame's available CPU time goes to rendering the 15 tiles per frame. The remaining time goes to other functionality like responding to user input and performing hardware IO.</p>
<h3 id="self-modifying-code">Self-modifying code</h3>
<p><img src="https://blog.otterstack.com/posts/202512-gbshader/hex_patched.gif" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>
<p><em>Figure: A hex representation of the shader subroutine instructions in RAM. The blue digits show a patch to change <code>sub a, 0</code> into <code>sub a, 8</code>.</em></p>
<p>The core shader subroutine contains a hot path that processes about 960 pixels per frame. It's really important to make this as fast as possible!</p>
<p>Self-modifying code is a super-effective way to make code <em>fast</em>. But most modern developers don't do this anymore, and there are good reasons: It's difficult, rarely portable, and it's hard to do it right without introducing serious security vulnerabilities. Modern developers are spoiled by an abundance of processing power, super-scalar processors that take optimal paths, and modern JIT (Just-In-Time) runtimes that generate code on the fly. But we're on the Game Boy, baybeee, so we don't have those options.</p>
<p>If you're a developer who uses higher-level languages like Python and JavaScript, the closest equivalent to self-modifying code is <code>eval()</code>. Think about how nervous <code>eval()</code> makes you feel. That's almost exactly how native developers feel about modifying instructions.</p>
<p>On the Game Boy's <strong>SM83</strong> processor, it's faster to add and subtract by a hard-coded number than it is to load that number from memory.</p>
<p>i.e. <code>x += 5</code> is faster than <code>x += variable</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>unsigned</span> <span>char</span> Ltheta = <span>8</span>;

<span>// Slower</span>
v = (*in++) - Ltheta;

<span>// Faster</span>
v = (*in++) - <span>8</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>In SM83 assembly, this looks like:</p>
<pre><code>; Slower: 28 cycles
ld a, [Ltheta]   ; 12 cycles: Read variable "Ltheta" from HRAM
ld b, a          ; 4 cycles:  Move value to B register
ld a, [hl+]      ; 8 cycles:  Read from the HL pointer
sub a, b         ; 4 cycles:  A = A - B

; Faster: 16 cycles
ld a, [hl+]      ; 8 cycles: Read from the HL pointer
sub a, 8         ; 8 cycles: A = A - 8
</code></pre>
<p>The faster way shaves off 12 cycles. If we're rendering 960 pixels, this saves a total of 11,520 cycles. This doesn't sound like a lot, but it's roughly 10% of the shader's runtime!</p>
<p>So how can we get the faster subtraction if the value we're subtracting with changes?</p>
<p>By modifying the instruction operand!</p>
<pre><code>2A      ld a, [hl+]
D6 08   sub a, 8
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>"AI Will Be Writing 90% of Code in 3 to 6 Months"
<br>
— Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic (March 2025 - 9 months ago as of writing)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>95% of this project was made by hand</strong>. Large language models struggle to write Game Boy assembly. I don't blame them.</p>

<p><em>Update: 2026-02-03:</em>  I attempted to use AI to try out the process, mostly because 1) the industry won't shut up about AI, and 2) I wanted a grounded opinion of it for novel projects, so I have a concrete and personal reference point when talking about it in the wild. At the end of the day, this is still a hobbyist project, so AI really isn't the point! But still...</p>
<p>I believe in disclosing all attempts or actual uses of generative AI output, because I think it's unethical to deceive people about the process of your work. Not doing so undermines trust, and amounts to disinformation or plagiarism. Disclosure also invites people who have disagreements to engage with the work, which they should be able to. I'm open to feedback, btw.</p>
<p><strong>I'll probably write something about my experiences with AI in the future.</strong></p>
<p><strong>As far as disclosures go, I used AI for</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Python: Reading OpenEXR layers, as part of a conversion script to read normal map data</li>
<li>Python/Blender: Some Python scripts for populating Blender scenes, to demo the process in Blender</li>
<li>SM83 assembly: Snippets for Game Boy Color features like double-speed and VRAM DMA. Unsurprising, because these are likely available somewhere else.</li>
</ol>
<p>I <em>attempted</em> - and failed - to use AI for:</p>
<ol>
<li>SM83 assembly: <em>(Unused)</em> Generating an initial revision of the shader code</li>
</ol>
<p>I'll also choose to disclose what <strong>I did NOT use AI for:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Writing this article</li>
<li>The algorithms, lookups, all other SM83 assembly</li>
<li>3D assets</li>
<li>The soul 🌟 (AI techbros are groaning right now)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="i-tried-to-make-ai-write-game-boy-assembly">I tried to make AI write Game Boy assembly</h3>
<p>Just to see what it would do, <strong>I fed pseudocode into Claude Sonnet 4</strong> (the industry claims that it's the best AI model for coding in 2025), and got it to generate SM83 assembly:</p>
<p><a href="https://claude.ai/share/846cb7d4-e4a6-40ab-8aaa-6e4c308e3da3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://claude.ai/share/846cb7d4-e4a6-40ab-8aaa-6e4c308e3da3</a></p>
<p>It was an interesting process. To start, I chewed Claude's food and gave it pseudocode, because I had a data format in mind, and I assumed it'd struggle with a higher-level description.</p>
<p>I was skeptical that it wouldn't do well, but it did better than I thought it would. It even produced code that worked when I persisted it and guided it enough. However, it wasn't very fast, and it made some initial mistakes by assuming the SM83 processor was the Z80 processor. I attempted to get Claude to optimize it by offering suggestions. It did well initially, but it introduced errors until I reached the conversation limit.</p>
<p>After that point, I manually rewrote everything. My final implementation is aggressively optimized and barely has any resemblance to Claude's take.</p>
<p><strong>And it <em>loved</em> telling me how "absolutely right" I always was.</strong> 🥺</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.otterstack.com/posts/202512-gbshader/claude_glazing_me.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="539" height="800"></p>
<p>It was better for small tasks and snippets of code. The tile demo in my video was partially AI scripted. A Game Boy subroutine for copying to VRAM was authored by AI. Few issues there.</p>
<p><del>An early iteration of the normal map conversion script accepted OpenEXR files. I didn't feel like drudging through a new library, so I asked ChatGPT to convert an OpenEXR file to a numpy array. It did pretty well! It however also introduced a very subtle bug that I didn't catch for weeks. Once I finally read the code, I realized it was sorting channel names alphabetically (so XYZ sorts as XYZ, but RGB sorts as BGR). It's the sort of error I'd never make myself.</del></p>
<p>Update: 2026-02-03 - Yeah, so the OpenEXR code could've been done in two lines this whole time. One of the first examples in <a href="https://pypi.org/project/OpenEXR/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">the official PyPi readme</a> shows how to get a numpy array from an OpenEXR file - exactly what I needed. I could update this snippet for different channels too in theory, but basically it's this. ChatGPT gave me 30 lines to handle edge cases that simply won't happen.</p>
<pre><code><span>with</span> OpenEXR.File(<span>"readme.exr"</span>) <span>as</span> infile:
    RGB = infile.channels()[<span>"RGB"</span>].pixels
</code></pre>
<p>At this point, I can't emphasize <strong>verifiable</strong> enough.</p>
<p>This, and other experiences, made me realize how easy it is to let your guard down when using AI like this, even if you're an experienced coder. AI can be helpful, but discretion is very much a required skill. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slopsquatting" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">I'm just thankful I never relied on it for installing hallucinated packages</a>.</p>

Modern PC motherboards' firmware follow <abbr title="Unified Extensible Firmware Interface, BIOS replacement">UEFI</abbr> specification since 2010. In 2013, a new technology called Secure Boot appeared, intended to prevent <abbr title="Malicious bootloaders designed to modify real OS bootloader, infect system files on HDD, or both">bootkits</abbr> from being installed and run. Secure Boot prevents the execution of unsigned or untrusted program code (.efi programs and operating system boot loaders, additional hardware firmware like video card and network adapter OPROMs).<br>
Secure Boot can be disabled on any retail motherboard, but a mandatory requirement for changing its state is physical presence of the user at the computer. It is necessary to enter UEFI settings when the computer boots, and only then it's possible to change Secure Boot settings.</p><p>

Most motherboards include only Microsoft keys as trusted, which forces bootable software vendors to ask Microsoft to sign their bootloaders. This process include code audit procedure and justification for the need to sign their file with globally trusted key if they want the disk or USB flash to work in Secure Boot mode without adding their key on each computer manually.<br>
Linux distributions, hypervisors, antivirus boot disks, computer recovery software authors all have to sign their bootloaders in Microsoft.</p><p>

I wanted to make a bootable USB flash drive with various computer recovery software that would boot without disabling Secure Boot. Let's see how this can be achieved. <a name="habracut"></a></p><h2>Signed bootloaders of bootloaders</h2><p>So, to boot Linux with Secure Boot enabled, you need a signed bootloader. Microsoft forbid to sign software licensed under GPLv3 because of <abbr title="The creation of a system that incorporates software under the terms of a copyleft software license (like the GPL), but uses hardware restrictions to prevent users from running modified versions of the software on that hardware (wikipedia).">tivoization</abbr> restriction license rule, therefore <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Windows-Hardware-Certification/Microsoft-UEFI-CA-Signing-policy-updates/ba-p/364828?advanced=false&amp;collapse_discussion=true&amp;q=uefi&amp;search_type=thread" rel="nofollow">GRUB cannot be signed</a>.<br>
To address this issue, Linux Foundation released <a href="https://blog.hansenpartnership.com/linux-foundation-secure-boot-system-released/" rel="nofollow">PreLoader</a> and Matthew Garrett made <a href="http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/20303.html" rel="nofollow">shim</a>—small bootloaders that verify the signature or hash of a single file and execute it. PreLoader and shim do not use <abbr title="Trusted certificate store on the motherboard">UEFI db</abbr> certificate store, but contain a database of allowed hashes (PreLoader) or certificates (shim) inside the executable file.<br>
Both programs, in addition to automatically executing trusted files, allow you to run any previously untrusted programs in Secure Boot mode, but require the physical presence of the user. When executed for the first time, you need to select a certificate to be added or the file to be hashed in the graphical interface, after which the data is added into a special NVRAM variable on the motherboard which is not accessible from the loaded operating system. Files become trusted only for these pre-loaders, not for Secure Boot in general, and still couldn't be loaded without PreLoader or shim.</p><p>

<img src="https://habrastorage.org/r/w1560/webt/8v/fh/ut/8vfhut0fieoez9092xlirmoxndk.png" alt="Untrusted software first boot with shim." sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 50vw" srcset="https://habrastorage.org/r/w780/webt/8v/fh/ut/8vfhut0fieoez9092xlirmoxndk.png 780w,

<i>Untrusted software first boot with shim.</i></p><p>

All modern popular Linux distributions use shim due to certificate support, which makes it easy to provide updates for the main bootloader without the need for user interaction. In general, shim is used to run GRUB2 — the most popular bootloader in Linux.</p><h2>GRUB2</h2><p>To prevent signed bootloader abuse with malicious intentions, Red Hat created patches for GRUB2 that block «dangerous» functions when Secure Boot is enabled: insmod/rmmod, appleloader, linux (replaced by linuxefi), multiboot, xnu, memrw, iorw. The chainloader module, which loads arbitrary .efi-files, introduced its own custom internal .efi (PE) loader without using the UEFI LoadImage/StartImage functions, as well as the validation code of the loaded files via shim, in order to preserve the ability to load files trusted by shim but not trusted in terms of UEFI. It's not exactly clear why this method is preferable—UEFI allows one to redefine (hook) UEFI verification functions, this is how PreLoader works, and indeed the very <a href="https://github.com/rhboot/shim/blob/741c61abba7d5c74166f8d0c1b9ee8001ebcd186/lib/security_policy.c" rel="nofollow">shim feature is present</a> but disabled by default.</p><p>

Anyway, using the signed GRUB from some Linux distribution does not suit our needs. There are two ways to create a universal bootable flash drive that would not require adding the keys of each executable file to the trusted files:</p><ul>
<li>Use modded GRUB with internal EFI loader, without digital signature vertification or module restrictions;</li>
<li>Use custom pre-loader (the second one) which hook UEFI file vertification functions (EFI_SECURITY_ARCH_PROTOCOL.FileAuthenticationState, EFI_SECURITY2_ARCH_PROTOCOL.FileAuthentication)</li>
</ul><p>
The second method is preferable as executed software can load and start another software, for example, UEFI shell can execute any program. The first method does not provide this, allowing only GRUB to execute arbitrary files. Let's <a href="https://github.com/ValdikSS/Super-UEFIinSecureBoot-Disk/tree/master/efi-tools-patches" rel="nofollow">modify PreLoader</a> by removing all unnecessary features and patch verification code to allow everything.</p><p>

MokManager.efi

(Key enrolling
 tool)</code></pre><p>

This is how </p><a href="https://github.com/ValdikSS/Super-UEFIinSecureBoot-Disk" rel="nofollow"><u>Super</u> UEFIinSecureBoot Disk</a><p> has been made.</p><blockquote>Super UEFIinSecureBoot Disk is a bootable image with GRUB2 bootloader designed to be used as a base for recovery USB flash drives.<p>

Key feature: disk is fully functional with UEFI Secure Boot mode activated. It can launch any operating system or .efi file, even with untrusted, invalid or missing signature.</p><p>

The disk could be used to run various Live Linux distributions, WinPE environment, network boot, without disabling Secure Boot mode in UEFI settings, which could be convenient for performing maintenance of someone else's PC and corporate laptops, for example, with UEFI settings locked with a password.</p><p>

The image contains 3 components: shim pre-loader from Fedora (signed with Microsoft key which is pre-installed in most motherboards and laptops), modified Linux Foundation PreLoader (disables digital signature verification of executed files), and modified GRUB2 loader.</p><p>

On the first boot it's necessary to select the certificate using MokManager (starts automatically), after that everything will work just as with Secure Boot disabled—GRUB loads any unsigned .efi file or Linux kernel, executed EFI programs can load any other untrusted executables or drivers.</p><p>

To demonstrate disk functions, the image contains Super Grub Disk (a set of scripts to search and execute OS even if the bootloader is broken), GRUB Live ISO Multiboot (a set of scripts to load Linux Live distros directly from ISO file), One File Linux (the kernel and initrd in a single file, for system recovery) and several UEFI utilities.</p><p>

The disk is also compatible with UEFI without Secure Boot and with older PCs with BIOS.</p></blockquote><h2>Signed bootloaders</h2><p>I was wondering is it possible to bypass first boot key enrollment through shim. Could there be some signed bootloader that allow you to do more than the authors expected?<br>
As it turned out—there are such loaders. One of them is used in <a href="https://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/krd18" rel="nofollow">Kaspersky Rescue Disk 18</a>—antivirus software boot disk. GRUB from the disk allows you to load modules (the insmod command), and module in GRUB is just an executable code. The pre-loader on the disk is a custom one.</p><p>

Of course, you can't just use GRUB from the disk to load untrusted code. It is necessary to modify the chainloader module so that GRUB does not use the UEFI LoadImage/StartImage functions, but instead self-loads the .efi file into memory, performs relocation, finds the entry point and jumps to it. Fortunately, almost all the necessary code is present in <a href="https://github.com/rhboot/grub2/tree/grub-2.02-sb" rel="nofollow">Red Hat GRUB Secure Boot repository</a>, the only problem—<abbr title="Portable Executable. File format used for .exe and .efi files.">PE</abbr> header parser is missing. GRUB gets parsed header from shim, in a response to a function call via a special protocol. This could be easily fixed by porting the appropriate code from the shim or PreLoader to GRUB.</p><p>

This is how </p><u>Silent</u><p> UEFIinSecureBoot Disk has been made. The final disk architecture looks as follows:</p><pre><code>   ______            ______                ______

 fde_ld.efi + custom chain.mod

(Kaspersky GRUB2)</code></pre><h2>The end</h2><p>In this article we proved the existence of not enough reliable bootloaders signed by Microsoft key, which allows booting untrusted code in Secure Boot mode.<br>
Using signed Kaspersky Rescue Disk files, we achieved a silent boot of any untrusted .efi files with Secure Boot enabled, without the need to add a certificate to UEFI db or shim MOK.<br>
These files can be used both for good deeds (for booting from USB flash drives) and for evil ones (for installing bootkits without computer owner consent).<br>
I assume that Kaspersky bootloader signature certificate will not live long, and it will be added to <a href="https://uefi.org/revocationlistfile" rel="nofollow">global UEFI certificate revocation list</a>, which will be installed on computers running Windows 10 via Windows Update, breaking Kaspersky Rescue Disk 18 and Silent UEFIinSecureBoot Disk. Let's see how soon this would happen.</p><p>

   terms `foo', `bar', or `foobar' as metasyntactic variables without
   any proper explanation or definition.  This document rectifies that
   deficiency.

   Approximately 212 RFCs, or about 7% of RFCs issued so far, starting
   with [<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc269">RFC269</a>], contain the terms `foo', `bar', or `foobar' used as a
   metasyntactic variable without any proper explanation or definition.
   This may seem trivial, but a number of newcomers, especially if
   English is not their native language, have had problems in
   understanding the origin of those terms.  This document rectifies
   that deficiency.

   <a href="#section-2">Section 2</a> below describes the definition and etymology of these words
   and <a href="#section-3">Section 3</a> interprets them as acronyms.

   As an Appendix, we include a table of RFC occurrences of these words
   as metasyntactic variables.

<span><a id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>. Definition and Etymology</span>

   bar /bar/ n. [<a href="#ref-JARGON">JARGON</a>]

   1. The second metasyntactic variable, after foo and before baz.
      "Suppose we have two functions: FOO and BAR.  FOO calls BAR...."

   2. Often appended to foo to produce foobar.

   foo /foo/

   1. interj.  Term of disgust.

   2. Used very generally as a sample name for absolutely anything, esp.
      programs and files (esp. scratch files).

   3. First on the standard list of metasyntactic variables used in
      syntax examples (bar, baz, qux, quux, corge, grault, garply,
      waldo, fred, plugh, xyzzy, thud). [<a href="#ref-JARGON">JARGON</a>]

      When used in connection with `bar' it is generally traced to the
      WW II era Army slang acronym FUBAR (`Fucked Up Beyond All
      Repair'), later modified to foobar.  Early versions of the Jargon
      File [<a href="#ref-JARGON">JARGON</a>] interpreted this change as a post-war
      bowdlerization, but it now seems more likely that FUBAR was itself
      a derivative of `foo' perhaps influenced by German `furchtbar'
      (terrible) - `foobar' may actually have been the original form.

      For, it seems, the word `foo' itself had an immediate prewar
      history in comic strips and cartoons.  In the 1938 Warner Brothers
      cartoon directed by Robert Clampett, "The Daffy Doc", a very early
      version of Daffy Duck holds up a sign saying "SILENCE IS FOO!"
      `FOO' and `BAR' also occurred in Walt Kelly's "Pogo" strips.  The
      earliest documented uses were in the surrealist "Smokey Stover"
      comic strip by Bill Holman about a fireman.  This comic strip
      appeared in various American comics including "Everybody's"
      between about 1930 and 1952.  It frequently included the word
      "FOO" on license plates of cars, in nonsense sayings in the
      background of some frames such as "He who foos last foos best" or
      "Many smoke but foo men chew", and had Smokey say "Where there's
      foo, there's fire".  Bill Holman, the author of the strip, filled
      it with odd jokes and personal contrivances, including other

<span><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3092">RFC 3092</a>                   Etymology of "Foo"               1 April 2001</span>


      nonsense phrases such as "Notary Sojac" and "1506 nix nix".
      According to the Warner Brothers Cartoon Companion [<a href="#ref-WBCC">WBCC</a>] Holman
      claimed to have found the word "foo" on the bottom of a Chinese
      figurine.  This is plausible; Chinese statuettes often have
      apotropaic inscriptions, and this may have been the Chinese word
      `fu' (sometimes transliterated `foo'), which can mean "happiness"
      when spoken with the proper tone (the lion-dog guardians flanking
      the steps of many Chinese restaurants are properly called "fu
      dogs") [<a href="#ref-PERS">PERS</a>].  English speakers' reception of Holman's `foo'
      nonsense word was undoubtedly influenced by Yiddish `feh' and
      English `fooey' and `fool'. [<a href="#ref-JARGON">JARGON</a>, <a href="#ref-FOLDOC">FOLDOC</a>]

      Holman's strip featured a firetruck called the Foomobile that rode
      on two wheels.  The comic strip was tremendously popular in the
      late 1930s, and legend has it that a manufacturer in Indiana even
      produced an operable version of Holman's Foomobile.  According to
      the Encyclopedia of American Comics [<a href="#ref-EAC">EAC</a>], `Foo' fever swept the
      U.S., finding its way into popular songs and generating over 500
      `Foo Clubs.' The fad left `foo' references embedded in popular
      culture (including the couple of appearances in Warner Brothers
      cartoons of 1938-39) but with their origins rapidly forgotten.
      [<a href="#ref-JARGON">JARGON</a>]

      One place they are known to have remained live is in the U.S.
      military during the WWII years.  In 1944-45, the term `foo
      fighters' [<a href="#ref-FF">FF</a>] was in use by radar operators for the kind of
      mysterious or spurious trace that would later be called a UFO (the
      older term resurfaced in popular American usage in 1995 via the
      name of one of the better grunge-rock bands [<a href="#ref-BFF">BFF</a>]).  Informants
      connected the term to the Smokey Stover strip [<a href="#ref-PERS">PERS</a>].

      The U.S. and British militaries frequently swapped slang terms
      during the war.  Period sources reported that `FOO' became a
      semi-legendary subject of WWII British-army graffiti more or less
      equivalent to the American Kilroy [<a href="#ref-WORDS">WORDS</a>].  Where British troops
      went, the graffito "FOO was here" or something similar showed up.
      Several slang dictionaries aver that FOO probably came from
      Forward Observation Officer, but this (like the contemporaneous
      "FUBAR") was probably a backronym [<a href="#ref-JARGON">JARGON</a>].  Forty years later,
      Paul Dickson's excellent book "Words" [<a href="#ref-WORDS">WORDS</a>] traced "Foo" to an
      unspecified British naval magazine in 1946, quoting as follows:

         "Mr. Foo is a mysterious Second World War product, gifted with
         bitter omniscience and sarcasm."

      Earlier versions of the Jargon File suggested the possibility that
      hacker usage actually sprang from "FOO, Lampoons and Parody", the
      title of a comic book first issued in September 1958, a joint

      project of Charles and Robert Crumb.  Though Robert Crumb (then in
      his mid-teens) later became one of the most important and
      influential artists in underground comics, this venture was hardly
      a success; indeed, the brothers later burned most of the existing
      copies in disgust.  The title FOO was featured in large letters on
      the front cover.  However, very few copies of this comic actually
      circulated, and students of Crumb's `oeuvre' have established that
      this title was a reference to the earlier Smokey Stover comics.
      The Crumbs may also have been influenced by a short-lived Canadian
      parody magazine named `Foo' published in 1951-52. [<a href="#ref-JARGON">JARGON</a>]

      An old-time member reports that in the 1959 "Dictionary of the
      TMRC Language", compiled at TMRC (the Tech Model Railroad Club at
      MIT) there was an entry for Foo.  The current on-line version, in
      which "Foo" is the only word coded to appear red, has the
      following [<a href="#ref-TMRC">TMRC</a>]:

         Foo:  The sacred syllable (FOO MANI PADME HUM); to be spoken
         only when under obligation to commune with the Deity. Our first
         obligation is to keep the Foo Counters turning.

      This definition used Bill Holman's nonsense word, then only two
      decades old and demonstrably still live in popular culture and
      slang, to make a "ha ha only serious" analogy with esoteric
      Tibetan Buddhism.  Today's hackers would find it difficult to
      resist elaborating a joke like that, and it is not likely 1959's
      were any less susceptible. [<a href="#ref-JARGON">JARGON</a>]

   4. [<a href="#ref-EF">EF</a>] Prince Foo was the last ruler of Pheebor and owner of the
      Phee Helm, about 400 years before the reign of Entharion.  When
      Foo was beheaded by someone he called an "eastern fop" from
      Borphee, the glorious age of Pheebor ended, and Borphee rose to
      the prominence it now enjoys.

   5. [<a href="#ref-OED">OED</a>] A 13th-16th century usage for the devil or any other enemy.
      The earliest citation it gives is from the year 1366, Chaucer A B
      C (84): "Lat not our alder foo [devil] make his bobance [boast]".
      Chaucer's "Foo" is probably related to modern English "foe".

   6. Rare species of dog.

      A spitz-type dog discovered to exist after having long been
      considered extinct, the Chinese Foo Dog, or Sacred Dog of
      Sinkiang, may have originated through a crossing of Northern
      European hunting dogs and the ancient Chow Chow from Mongolia or
      be the missing link between the Chinese Wolf and the Chow Chow.
      It probably derives its name from foochow, of the kind or style

      prevalent in Foochow, of or from the city of Foochow (now Minhow)
      in southeast China. [<a href="#ref-DOG">DOG</a>]

   foobar n.

      [<a id="ref-JARGON">JARGON</a>] A widely used metasyntactic variable; see foo for
      etymology.  Probably originally propagated through DECsystem
      manuals by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in 1960s and early
      1970s; confirmed sightings there go back to 1972.  Hackers do not
      generally use this to mean FUBAR in either the slang or jargon
      sense.  It has been plausibly suggested that "foobar" spread among
      early computer engineers partly because of FUBAR and partly
      because "foo bar" parses in electronics techspeak as an inverted
      foo signal.

   foo-fighter n.

      World War II term for Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) noted by
      both German and British military.  See [<a href="#ref-FF">FF</a>] and entry above for
      "foo".

   variables.  (This excludes other uses that are reasonably clear like
   "vertical bar" or "bar BoF".)  Many of these uses are for example
   domain names.  That usage may decrease with the specification in [RFC

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><!----><p>I shipped more code last quarter than any quarter in my career. I also felt more drained than any quarter in my career. These two facts are not unrelated.</p>
<p>I build AI agent infrastructure for a living. I'm one of the core maintainers of <a href="https://openfga.dev/">OpenFGA</a> (CNCF Incubating), I built <a href="https://github.com/Siddhant-K-code/agentic-authz">agentic-authz</a> for agent authorization, I built <a href="https://distill.siddhantkhare.com/">Distill</a> for context deduplication, I shipped MCP servers. I'm not someone who dabbles with AI on the side. I'm deep in it. I build the tools that other engineers use to make AI agents work in production.</p>
<p>And yet, I hit a wall. The kind of exhaustion that no amount of tooling or workflow optimization could fix.</p>
<p>If you're an engineer who uses AI daily - for design reviews, code generation, debugging, documentation, architecture decisions - and you've noticed that you're somehow more tired than before AI existed, this post is for you. You're not imagining it. You're not weak. You're experiencing something real that the industry is aggressively pretending doesn't exist. And if someone who builds agent infrastructure full-time can burn out on AI, it can happen to anyone.</p>
<p>I want to talk about it honestly. Not the "AI is amazing and here's my workflow" version. The real version. The one where you stare at your screen at 11pm, surrounded by AI-generated code you still need to review, wondering why the tool that was supposed to save you time has consumed your entire day.</p>
<p><img src="https://siddhantkhare.com/blog/ai-fatigue-is-real/1.png" alt="An overwhelmed engineer surrounded by code, errors, and notifications"></p>
<h2>The paradox nobody warned us about</h2>
<p>Here's the thing that broke my brain for a while: AI genuinely makes individual tasks faster. That's not a lie. What used to take me 3 hours now takes 45 minutes. Drafting a design doc, scaffolding a new service, writing test cases, researching an unfamiliar API. All faster.</p>
<p>But my days got harder. Not easier. Harder.</p>
<p>The reason is simple once you see it, but it took me months to figure out. When each task takes less time, you don't do fewer tasks. You do more tasks. Your capacity appears to expand, so the work expands to fill it. And then some. Your manager sees you shipping faster, so the expectations adjust. You see yourself shipping faster, so your own expectations adjust. The baseline moves.</p>
<p>Before AI, I might spend a full day on one design problem. I'd sketch on paper, think in the shower, go for a walk, come back with clarity. The pace was slow but the cognitive load was manageable. One problem. One day. Deep focus.</p>
<p>Now? I might touch six different problems in a day. Each one "only takes an hour with AI." But context-switching between six problems is brutally expensive for the human brain. The AI doesn't get tired between problems. I do.</p>
<p>This is the paradox: <strong>AI reduces the cost of production but increases the cost of coordination, review, and decision-making. And those costs fall entirely on the human.</strong></p>
<h2>You became a reviewer and you didn't sign up for it</h2>
<p><img src="https://siddhantkhare.com/blog/ai-fatigue-is-real/3.png" alt="AI dropping code onto a conveyor belt faster than a human can review"></p>
<p>Before AI, my job was: think about a problem, write code, test it, ship it. I was the creator. The maker. That's what drew most of us to engineering in the first place - the act of building.</p>
<p>After AI, my job increasingly became: prompt, wait, read output, evaluate output, decide if output is correct, decide if output is safe, decide if output matches the architecture, fix the parts that don't, re-prompt, repeat. I became a reviewer. A judge. A quality inspector on an assembly line that never stops.</p>
<p>This is a fundamentally different kind of work. Creating is energizing. Reviewing is draining. There's research on this - the psychological difference between generative tasks and evaluative tasks. Generative work gives you flow states. Evaluative work gives you decision fatigue.</p>
<p>I noticed it first during a week where I was using AI heavily for a new microservice. By Wednesday, I couldn't make simple decisions anymore. What should this function be named? I didn't care. Where should this config live? I didn't care. My brain was full. Not from writing code - from judging code. Hundreds of small judgments, all day, every day.</p>
<p>The cruel irony is that AI-generated code requires more careful review than human-written code. When a colleague writes code, I know their patterns, their strengths, their blind spots. I can skim the parts I trust and focus on the parts I don't. With AI, every line is suspect. The code looks confident. It compiles. It might even pass tests. But it could be subtly wrong in ways that only surface in production, under load, at 3am.</p>
<p>So you read every line. And reading code you didn't write, that was generated by a system that doesn't understand your codebase's history or your team's conventions, is exhausting work.</p>
<p>This is also why I think agent security and authorization matter so much. If we can't review everything AI produces - and we can't, not at scale - then we need systems that constrain what agents can do in the first place. Least-privilege access, scoped tokens, audit trails. The less you have to worry about "did the AI do something dangerous," the more cognitive budget you have for the work that actually matters. This isn't just a security problem. It's a human sustainability problem.</p>
<h2>The nondeterminism problem</h2>
<p>Engineers are trained on determinism. Same input, same output. That's the contract. That's what makes debugging possible. That's what makes reasoning about systems possible.</p>
<p>AI broke that contract.</p>
<p><img src="https://siddhantkhare.com/blog/ai-fatigue-is-real/4.png" alt="Same prompt, same AI, different results - clean code or spaghetti"></p>
<p>I had a prompt that worked perfectly on Monday. Generated clean, well-structured code for an API endpoint. I used the same prompt on Tuesday for a similar endpoint. The output was structurally different, used a different error handling pattern, and introduced a dependency I didn't ask for.</p>
<p>Why? No reason. Or rather, no reason I can access. There's no stack trace for "the model decided to go a different direction today." There's no log that says "temperature sampling chose path B instead of path A." It just... happened differently.</p>
<p>For someone whose entire career is built on "if it broke, I can find out why," this is deeply unsettling. Not in a dramatic way. In a slow, grinding, background-anxiety way. You can never fully trust the output. You can never fully relax. Every interaction requires vigilance.</p>
<p>I tried to fight this. I version-controlled my prompts. I built elaborate system messages. I created templates. Some of it helped. None of it solved the fundamental problem: <strong>you are collaborating with a probabilistic system, and your brain is wired for deterministic ones.</strong> That mismatch is a constant, low-grade source of stress.</p>
<p>This frustration is actually what led me to build <a href="https://distill.siddhantkhare.com/">Distill</a> - deterministic context deduplication for LLMs. No LLM calls, no embeddings, no probabilistic heuristics. Pure algorithms that clean your context in ~12ms. I wanted at least one part of the AI pipeline to be something I could reason about, debug, and trust. If the model's output is going to be nondeterministic, the least I can do is make sure the input is clean and predictable.</p>
<p>The engineers I've talked to who handle this best are the ones who've made peace with it. They treat AI output like a first draft from a smart but unreliable intern. They expect to rewrite 30% of it. They budget time for that rewriting. They don't get frustrated when the output is wrong because they never expected it to be right. They expected it to be useful. There's a difference.</p>
<h2>The FOMO treadmill</h2>
<p>Take a breath and try to keep up with just the last few months. Claude Code ships sub-agents, then skills, then an Agent SDK, then Claude Cowork. OpenAI launches Codex CLI, then GPT-5.3-Codex - a model that literally helped code itself. New coding agents announce background mode with hundreds of concurrent autonomous sessions. Google drops Gemini CLI. GitHub adds an MCP Registry. Acquisitions happen weekly. Amazon Q Developer gets agentic upgrades. CrewAI, AutoGen, LangGraph, MetaGPT - pick your agent framework, there's a new one every week. Google announces A2A (Agent-to-Agent protocol) to compete with Anthropic's MCP. OpenAI ships its own Swarm framework. Kimi K2.5 drops with agent swarm architecture orchestrating 100 parallel agents. "Vibe coding" becomes a thing. OpenClaw launches a skills marketplace and within one week, researchers find 400+ malicious agent skills uploaded to ClawHub. And somewhere in the middle of all this, someone on LinkedIn posts "if you're not using AI agents with sub-agent orchestration in 2026, you're already obsolete."</p>
<p>That's not a year. That's a few months. And I'm leaving stuff out.</p>
<p>I fell into this trap hard. I was spending weekends evaluating new tools. Reading every changelog. Watching every demo. Trying to stay at the frontier because I was terrified of falling behind.</p>
<p>Here's what that actually looked like: I'd spend Saturday afternoon setting up a new AI coding tool. By Sunday I'd have a basic workflow. By the following Wednesday, someone would post about a different tool that was "way better." I'd feel a pang of anxiety. By the next weekend, I'd be setting up the new thing. The old thing would sit unused. One coding assistant to the next to the next and back to the first one. Each migration cost me a weekend and gave me maybe a 5% improvement that I couldn't even measure properly.</p>
<p>Multiply this by every category - coding assistants, chat interfaces, agent frameworks, multi-agent orchestration platforms, MCP servers, context management tools, prompt libraries, swarm architectures, skills marketplaces - and you get a person who is perpetually learning new tools and never getting deep with any of them. The Hacker News front page alone is enough to give you whiplash. One day it's "Show HN: Autonomous Research Swarm" and the next it's "Ask HN: How will AI swarms coordinate?" Nobody knows. Everyone's building anyway.</p>
<p>The worst part is the knowledge decay. I spent two weeks building a sophisticated prompt engineering workflow in early 2025. Carefully crafted system prompts, few-shot examples, chain-of-thought templates. It worked well. Three months later, the model updated, the prompting best practices shifted, and half my templates produced worse results than a simple one-liner. Those two weeks were gone. Not invested. Spent. The same thing happened with my MCP server setup - I built five custom servers (Dev.to publisher, Apple Notes integration, Python and TypeScript sandboxes, more), then the protocol evolved, then the MCP Registry launched on GitHub and suddenly there were thousands of pre-built ones. Some of my custom work became redundant overnight.</p>
<p>The agent framework churn is even worse. I watched teams go from LangChain to CrewAI to AutoGen to custom orchestration in the span of a year. Each migration meant rewriting integrations, relearning APIs, rebuilding workflows. The people who waited and did nothing often ended up in a better position than the people who adopted early and had to migrate twice.</p>
<p>I've since adopted a different approach. Instead of chasing every new tool, I go deep on the infrastructure layer underneath them. Tools come and go. The problems they solve don't. Context efficiency, agent authorization, audit trails, runtime security - these are durable problems regardless of which framework is trending this month. That's why I built <a href="https://github.com/Siddhant-K-code/agentic-authz">agentic-authz</a> on OpenFGA instead of tying it to any specific agent framework. That's why Distill works at the context level, not the prompt level. Build on the layer that doesn't churn.</p>
<p>I still track the landscape closely - you have to when you're building infrastructure for it. But I track it to understand where the ecosystem is going, not to adopt every new thing. There's a difference between being informed and being reactive.</p>
<h2>The "just one more prompt" trap</h2>
<p>This one is insidious. You're trying to get AI to generate something specific. The first output is 70% right. So you refine your prompt. The second output is 75% right but broke something the first one had correct. Third attempt: 80% right but now the structure is different. Fourth attempt: you've been at this for 45 minutes and you could have written the thing from scratch in 20.</p>
<p>I call this the prompt spiral. It's the AI equivalent of yak shaving. You started with a clear goal. Thirty minutes later you're debugging your prompt instead of debugging your code. You're optimizing your instructions to a language model instead of solving the actual problem.</p>
<p>The prompt spiral is especially dangerous because it feels productive. You're iterating. You're getting closer. Each attempt is slightly better. But the marginal returns are diminishing fast, and you've lost sight of the fact that the goal was never "get the AI to produce perfect output." The goal was to ship the feature.</p>
<p>I now have a hard rule: three attempts. If the AI doesn't get me to 70% usable in three prompts, I write it myself. No exceptions. This single rule has saved me more time than any prompting technique I've ever learned.</p>
<h2>Perfectionism meets probabilistic output</h2>
<p>Engineers tend toward perfectionism. We like clean code. We like tests that pass. We like systems that behave predictably. This is a feature, not a bug - it's what makes us good at building reliable software.</p>
<p>AI output is never perfect. It's always "pretty good." 70-80% there. The variable names are slightly off. The error handling is incomplete. The edge cases are ignored. The abstraction is wrong for your codebase. It works, but it's not right.</p>
<p>For a perfectionist, this is torture. Because "almost right" is worse than "completely wrong." Completely wrong, you throw away and start over. Almost right, you spend an hour tweaking. And tweaking AI output is uniquely frustrating because you're fixing someone else's design decisions - decisions that were made by a system that doesn't share your taste, your context, or your standards.</p>
<p>I had to learn to let go. Not of quality - I still care about quality. But of the expectation that AI would produce quality. I now treat every AI output as a rough draft. A starting point. Raw material. I mentally label it "draft" the moment it appears, and that framing change alone reduced my frustration by half.</p>
<p>The engineers who struggle most with AI are often the best engineers. The ones with the highest standards. The ones who notice every imperfection. AI rewards a different skill: the ability to extract value from imperfect output quickly, without getting emotionally invested in making it perfect.</p>
<h2>The thinking atrophy</h2>
<p><img src="https://siddhantkhare.com/blog/ai-fatigue-is-real/5.png" alt="A brain on a couch watching AI, its thinking muscles covered in cobwebs"></p>
<p>This is the one that scares me most.</p>
<p>I noticed it during a design review meeting. Someone asked me to reason through a concurrency problem on the whiteboard. No laptop. No AI. Just me and a marker. And I struggled. Not because I didn't know the concepts - I did. But because I hadn't exercised that muscle in months. I'd been outsourcing my first-draft thinking to AI for so long that my ability to think from scratch had degraded.</p>
<p>It's like GPS and navigation. Before GPS, you built mental maps. You knew your city. You could reason about routes. After years of GPS, you can't navigate without it. The skill atrophied because you stopped using it.</p>
<p>The same thing is happening with AI and engineering thinking. When you always ask AI first, you stop building the neural pathways that come from struggling with a problem yourself. The struggle is where learning happens. The confusion is where understanding forms. Skip that, and you get faster output but shallower understanding.</p>
<p>I now deliberately spend the first hour of my day without AI. I think on paper. I sketch architectures by hand. I reason through problems the slow way. It feels inefficient. It is inefficient. But it keeps my thinking sharp, and that sharpness pays dividends for the rest of the day when I do use AI - because I can evaluate its output better when my own reasoning is warmed up.</p>
<h2>The comparison trap</h2>
<p>Social media is full of people who seem to have AI figured out. They post their workflows. Their productivity numbers. Their "I built this entire app in 2 hours with AI" threads. And you look at your own experience - the failed prompts, the wasted time, the code you had to rewrite - and you think: what's wrong with me?</p>
<p>Nothing is wrong with you. Those threads are highlight reels. Nobody posts "I spent 3 hours trying to get Claude to understand my database schema and eventually gave up and wrote the migration by hand." Nobody posts "AI-generated code caused a production incident because it silently swallowed an error." Nobody posts "I'm tired."</p>
<p>The comparison trap is amplified by the fact that AI skill is hard to measure. With traditional engineering, you can look at someone's code and roughly gauge their ability. With AI, the output depends on the model, the prompt, the context, the temperature, the phase of the moon. Someone's impressive demo might not reproduce on your machine with your codebase.</p>
<p>I became much more selective about AI content on social media. I still follow the space closely - I have to, it's my job. But I shifted from consuming everyone's hot takes to focusing on people who are actually building and shipping, not just demoing. The ratio of signal to anxiety matters. If a feed is making you feel behind instead of informed, it's not serving you.</p>
<h2>What actually helped</h2>
<p>I'll be specific about what changed my relationship with AI from adversarial to sustainable.</p>
<p><strong>Time-boxing AI sessions.</strong> I don't use AI in an open-ended way anymore. I set a timer. 30 minutes for this task with AI. When the timer goes off, I ship what I have or switch to writing it myself. This prevents the prompt spiral and the perfectionism trap simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>Separating AI time from thinking time.</strong> Morning is for thinking. Afternoon is for AI-assisted execution. This isn't rigid - sometimes I break the rule. But having a default structure means my brain gets both exercise and assistance in the right proportions.</p>
<p><strong>Accepting 70% from AI.</strong> I stopped trying to get perfect output. 70% usable is the bar. I'll fix the rest myself. This acceptance was the single biggest reducer of AI-related frustration in my workflow.</p>
<p><strong>Being strategic about the hype cycle.</strong> I track the AI landscape because I build infrastructure for it. But I stopped adopting every new tool the week it launches. I use one primary coding assistant and know it deeply. I evaluate new tools when they've proven themselves over months, not days. Staying informed and staying reactive are different things.</p>
<p><strong>Logging where AI helps and where it doesn't.</strong> I kept a simple log for two weeks: task, used AI (yes/no), time spent, satisfaction with result. The data was revealing. AI saved me significant time on boilerplate, documentation, and test generation. It cost me time on architecture decisions, complex debugging, and anything requiring deep context about my codebase. Now I know when to reach for it and when not to.</p>
<p><strong>Not reviewing everything AI produces.</strong> This was hard to accept. But if you're using AI to generate large amounts of code, you physically cannot review every line with the same rigor. I focus my review energy on the parts that matter most - security boundaries, data handling, error paths - and rely on automated tests and static analysis for the rest. Some roughness in non-critical code is acceptable.</p>
<h2>The sustainability question</h2>
<p>The tech industry has a burnout problem that predates AI. AI is making it worse, not better. Not because AI is bad, but because AI removes the natural speed limits that used to protect us.</p>
<p>Before AI, there was a ceiling on how much you could produce in a day. That ceiling was set by typing speed, thinking speed, the time it takes to look things up. It was frustrating sometimes, but it was also a governor. You couldn't work yourself to death because the work itself imposed limits.</p>
<p>AI removed the governor. Now the only limit is your cognitive endurance. And most people don't know their cognitive limits until they've blown past them.</p>
<p>I burned out in late 2025. Not dramatically - I didn't quit or have a breakdown. I just stopped caring. Code reviews became rubber stamps. Design decisions became "whatever AI suggests." I was going through the motions, producing more than ever, feeling less than ever. It took me a month to realize what had happened and another month to recover.</p>
<p>The recovery wasn't about using less AI. It was about using AI differently. With boundaries. With intention. With the understanding that I am not a machine and I don't need to keep pace with one. Working at <a href="https://ona.com/">Ona</a> helped me see this clearly - when you're building AI agent infrastructure for enterprise customers, you see the human cost of unsustainable AI workflows at scale. The problems aren't just personal. They're systemic. And they need to be solved at the tooling level, not just the individual level.</p>
<p>Ironically, the burnout period is when some of my best work happened. When I stopped trying to use every AI tool and started thinking about what was actually broken, I saw the problems clearly for the first time. Context windows filling up with garbage - that became Distill. Agents with all-or-nothing API key access - that became agentic-authz. The inability to audit what an agent actually did - that's becoming AgentTrace. The fatigue forced me to stop consuming and start building. Not building more features faster, but building the right things deliberately.</p>
<h2>The real skill</h2>
<p>Here's what I think the real skill of the AI era is. It's not prompt engineering. It's not knowing which model to use. It's not having the perfect workflow.</p>
<p>It's knowing when to stop.</p>
<p><img src="https://siddhantkhare.com/blog/ai-fatigue-is-real/6.png" alt="A hand pulling the STOP switch - good enough, ship it, go outside, rest"></p>
<p>Knowing when the AI output is good enough. Knowing when to write it yourself. Knowing when to close the laptop. Knowing when the marginal improvement isn't worth the cognitive cost. Knowing that your brain is a finite resource and that protecting it is not laziness - it's engineering.</p>
<p>We optimize our systems for sustainability. We add circuit breakers. We implement backpressure. We design for graceful degradation. We should do the same for ourselves.</p>
<p>AI is the most powerful tool I've ever used. It's also the most draining. Both things are true. The engineers who thrive in this era won't be the ones who use AI the most. They'll be the ones who use it the most wisely.</p>
<p>If you're tired, it's not because you're doing it wrong. It's because this is genuinely hard. The tool is new, the patterns are still forming, and the industry is pretending that more output equals more value. It doesn't. Sustainable output does.</p>
<p>I'm still building in this space every day. Agent authorization, context engineering, audit trails, runtime security - the infrastructure that makes AI agents actually work in production. I'm more committed to AI than ever. But I'm committed on my terms, at my pace, building things that matter instead of chasing things that trend.</p>
<p>Take care of your brain. It's the only one you've got, and no AI can replace it.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>I felt the familiar feeling of depression and lethargy creep in while my eyes darted from watching claude-code work
and my phone. “What’s the point of it all?” I thought, LLMs can generate decent-ish and correct-ish looking code
while I have more time to do what? doomscroll? This was the third time I gave claude-code a try. I felt the same
feelings every single time and ended up deleting claude-code after 2-3 weeks, and whaddyouknow? Every. Single. Time.
I rediscovered the joy of coding.</p><p>Yes, coding is not software engineering, but for me, it is a fun and essential part of it.
In order to be effective at software engineering, you must be familiar with the problem space, and this requires
thinking and wrestling with the problem. You can’t truly know the pain of using an API by just reading its documentation or implementation.
You have to use it to experience it.
The act of writing code, despite being slower, was a way for me to wrestle with the problem space, a way for me to find out that my initial ideas didn’t work, a way for thinking.
Vibe coding interfered with that.</p><blockquote><p>If you’re thinking without writing, you only think you’re thinking.</p><p>– Leslie Lamport</p></blockquote><p>The other major part of the job is to ensure correctness. For me, it is much harder to verify the correctness of code
I didn’t write compared to code I wrote. The process of writing code helps internalize the context and is
easier for my brain to think deeply about it. If I outsource this to an LLM, I skip over the process of internalizing
the problem domain and I can’t be certain that the generated code is correct.</p><p>By design, vibe coding has an addictive nature to it, you write some instructions, and code that <em>looks</em> correct is generated.
Bam! Dopamine hit! If the code isn’t correct, then it’s just one prompt away from being correct,
right? <em>right?</em></p><p>Vibe coding also has the profound effect of turning my brain off and passively accepting changes.
When it is time to use my brain, the inertia is much harder to overcome and it is easy to choose the lazy way out.
At my lowest point, I even asked it to do a find-and-replace in a file. Something that takes a few seconds, now took
minutes and a network call.</p><p>Even if I generate a 1,000 line PR in 30 minutes I still need to understand and review it.
Since I am responsible for the code I ship, this makes me the bottleneck.</p><p>The common view of vibe coding is that it is neither good nor bad, it is a tool. But tools shape your workflow and
your thought process, and if a tool prevents you from thinking deeply, I don’t think it is a good tool.
If you are a knowledge worker, your core competency is your ability to think, and if a tool interferes with that, be
afraid, be very afraid.</p><p>Now, I would be lying if I said I didn’t use LLMs to generate code. I still use Claude, but I do so in a more
controlled manner. I copy-paste files that I think are necessary to provide the context, and then I copy-paste code and
ask it to make changes to it or write tests for it. This friction has several benefits. I can’t make changes that span
multiple files, this means the generated diff isn’t too large, and if I have to manually change other files I know how
the code fits in. Manually giving claude the context forces me to be familiar with the codebase myself, rather than tell
it to just “cook”. It turns code generation from a passive action to a deliberate <em>thoughtful</em> action.
It also keeps my brain engaged and active, which means I can still enter the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow state</a>.
I have found this to be the best of both worlds and a way to preserve my happiness at work.</p><p>Ultimately, life is too short to not optimize for happiness. <strong>Maybe</strong> (a big maybe) generating entire features would make me more
productive, but if it causes existential dread and makes me depressed, I don’t see it being productive in the long
run. Maybe you relate to some of the feelings. Maybe you don’t. But don’t be afraid to choose differently.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Running your own Autonomous System on the public internet sounds like something reserved for ISPs and large enterprises. It’s not. With sponsoring LIRs making <span>AS</span> numbers and IPv6 prefixes accessible to individuals, and FreeBSD providing the routing tools to make it work, you can announce your own address space to the Default-Free Zone from a single virtual&nbsp;machine.</p>
<p>This article walks through the complete setup: obtaining resources from <span>RIPE</span> via a sponsoring <span>LIR</span>, configuring a FreeBSD <span>BGP</span> router with <span>FRR</span>, building <span>GRE</span>/<span>GIF</span> tunnels to distribute prefixes to remote servers, and solving the routing challenge that arises when a server needs to speak from two different IPv6 address spaces&nbsp;simultaneously.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note on addresses:</strong> All provider-assigned <span>IP</span> addresses, hostnames, and management IPs in this article have been replaced with <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5737"><span>RFC</span> 5737</a> / <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3849"><span>RFC</span> 3849</a> documentation ranges. My own <span>AS</span> number (<span>AS201379</span>) and prefix (2a06:9801:1c::/48) are public <span>BGP</span> resources and shown as-is. The upstream <span>AS</span> numbers (<span>AS34927</span>, <span>AS209735</span>) are equally visible in public routing&nbsp;tables.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Why Run Your Own <span>AS</span>?</h2>
<p>Provider-assigned IPv6 addresses are tied to that provider. Move to a different hoster and your addresses change - along with <span>DNS</span> records, firewall rules, reputation, and every system that references them. With your own <span>AS</span> and prefix, your addresses follow you. Migrate a server, update a tunnel endpoint, and traffic flows again without touching a single service&nbsp;configuration.</p>
<p>There are also less practical reasons. Understanding <span>BGP</span> transforms how you think about internet routing. Watching your prefix propagate through the <span>DFZ</span> and appear on looking glasses worldwide is genuinely satisfying. And if you run services across multiple providers, having provider-independent addressing simplifies the architecture&nbsp;considerably.</p>
<h2>Obtaining&nbsp;Resources</h2>
<p>To announce prefixes on the internet, you need two things from a Regional Internet Registry (in Europe, that’s <span>RIPE</span> <span>NCC</span>):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>An <span>AS</span> number</strong> - your identity in <span>BGP</span>. Mine is <span>AS201379</span>.</li>
<li><strong>An IPv6 prefix</strong> - the address space you’ll announce. I received&nbsp;2a06:9801:1c::/48.</li>
</ol>
<p>As an individual, you don’t need to become a <span>RIPE</span> member (which involves fees and bureaucracy). Instead, you work with a <strong>sponsoring <span>LIR</span></strong> - an existing <span>RIPE</span> member who sponsors your resource registration. Several LIRs cater to hobbyists and small operators. The process typically&nbsp;involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filling out a request form with your intended use&nbsp;case</li>
<li>Creating the appropriate <span>RIPE</span> database objects (aut-num, inet6num,&nbsp;route6)</li>
<li>Setting up <span>RPKI</span> ROAs (Route Origin Authorizations) to cryptographically bind your prefix to your <span>AS</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Once the paperwork is done, you need upstream connectivity - someone willing to carry your <span>BGP</span> sessions and announce your routes to the rest of the&nbsp;internet.</p>
<h2>Architecture&nbsp;Overview</h2>
<p>The setup involves two tiers: a <span>BGP</span> router that peers with upstream providers, and downstream servers that receive tunneled subnets from the router’s&nbsp;/48.</p>

<p>The <span>BGP</span> router&nbsp;(<code>router01</code>) announces 2a06:9801:1c::/48 to two upstream providers and maintains a blackhole route for the aggregate. Individual /64s (and a /62 for my Colocation datacenter) are tunneled to downstream servers via <span>GIF</span> tunnels (IPv6-in-IPv4 encapsulation). Each server receives real, globally routable addresses from my prefix while keeping its existing provider-assigned IPv6 fully&nbsp;operational.</p>
<h2>The <span>BGP</span>&nbsp;Router</h2>
<p>The router runs on a FreeBSD <span>VM</span> at a colocation facility with direct connectivity to two upstream networks. Let’s walk through each&nbsp;layer.</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>A few things worth&nbsp;explaining:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The blackhole route</strong>&nbsp;(<code>-reject</code> for the /48) is essential. Without it, traffic for unassigned subnets within your prefix would follow the default route back to the upstream, creating a routing loop. The blackhole ensures unrouted traffic is dropped&nbsp;locally.</li>
<li><strong>Point-to-point tunnel addresses</strong> use /128 prefixes on&nbsp;the <code>2a06:9801:1c:ffff::/64</code> link subnet. Each tunnel gets a pair of addresses from this&nbsp;range.</li>
<li><strong>Downstream routes</strong> point specific subnets at the far end of each tunnel. The /64 for the <span>VPS</span> and /62 for the datacenter are routed to their respective tunnel&nbsp;endpoints.</li>
<li><strong><span>GRE</span> vs <span>GIF</span></strong>: The iFog peering uses <span>GRE</span> because that’s what the provider requires. The downstream tunnels use <span>GIF</span> (protocol 41, IPv6-in-IPv4) which is simpler and has less&nbsp;overhead.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span>FRR</span>&nbsp;Configuration</h3>
<p><span>FRR</span> (Free Range Routing) handles the <span>BGP</span> sessions. The configuration lives&nbsp;at <code>/usr/local/etc/frr/frr.conf</code>:</p>

<p>There’s a lot happening here. Let me break down the key design&nbsp;decisions.</p>
<h4>Prefix&nbsp;Lists</h4>
<p>Two prefix lists control what gets sent and&nbsp;received:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>PL</span>-<span>MY</span>-<span>NET</span></strong>: Matches only our /48. Used in outbound route-maps to ensure we only ever announce our own&nbsp;prefix.</li>
<li><strong><span>PL</span>-<span>BOGONS</span></strong>: A comprehensive bogon filter for inbound routes. This rejects non-routable address space (link-local, <span>ULA</span>, multicast, documentation ranges), our own prefix (to prevent loops), and anything more specific than a /48 or less specific than a /8. The&nbsp;final <code>permit ::/0 le 48</code> at the end accepts everything that survived the deny&nbsp;rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bogon filter deserves emphasis. Accepting bad routes from peers can cause anything from black-holed traffic to becoming an unwitting participant in route hijacks. Filter aggressively on&nbsp;inbound.</p>
<h4>Route&nbsp;Maps</h4>
<p>Each peer gets its own pair of inbound/outbound route&nbsp;maps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Outbound to iFog</strong>&nbsp;(<code>RM-IFOG-OUT</code>): Announces our /48 with <span>BGP</span>&nbsp;communities <code>34927:9501</code> and <code>34927:9301</code>. These are iFog-specific communities that control route propagation - in this case, requesting announcement to specific peering&nbsp;partners.</li>
<li><strong>Outbound to Lagrange</strong>&nbsp;(<code>RM-LAGRANGE-OUT</code>): Announces our /48 with <span>AS</span>-path prepending (adds our <span>ASN</span> twice). This makes the Lagrange path appear longer to the rest of the internet, steering inbound traffic to prefer the iFog path. Useful for traffic engineering when one upstream has better&nbsp;connectivity.</li>
<li><strong>Inbound from both</strong>: Apply the bogon filter to reject garbage&nbsp;routes.</li>
</ul>
<h4><span>BGP</span> Session&nbsp;Details</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>no bgp default ipv4-unicast</code></strong>: We’re IPv6-only. Don’t activate IPv4 address family by&nbsp;default.</li>
<li><strong><code>ttl-security hops 1</code></strong>: <span>GTSM</span> (Generalized <span>TTL</span> Security Mechanism) - reject <span>BGP</span> packets with <span>TTL</span> less than 254. This prevents remote attacks on the <span>BGP</span> session since only directly connected peers can send packets with <span>TTL</span>&nbsp;255.</li>
<li><strong><code>soft-reconfiguration inbound</code></strong>: Store received routes before applying filters. This lets you change inbound policy without resetting the <span>BGP</span>&nbsp;session.</li>
<li><strong><code>maximum-prefix 250000 90 restart 30</code></strong>: Safety valve. If a peer sends more than 250,000 prefixes (or 90% of that as a warning), tear down the session and retry after 30 minutes. Protects against route leaks from&nbsp;upstream.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Firewall on the&nbsp;Router</h3>

<p>The firewall cleanly separates <strong>control plane</strong> (<span>SSH</span>, <span>BGP</span> sessions) from <strong>data plane</strong> (forwarded traffic). The control plane rules are strict: <span>BGP</span> is locked to known peer addresses, <span>SSH</span> to trusted management IPs. The data plane rules are simpler since the router just needs to forward packets between upstreams and downstream&nbsp;tunnels.</p>
<p>The <code>block in quick on $ext_if from { &lt;bogons&gt;, $my_network_v6 }</code> rule is important - it drops packets claiming to come from our own prefix arriving on the external interface. If someone on the internet spoofs a source address from our range, this catches it before it enters the forwarding&nbsp;path.</p>
<p>Note the per-tunnel <span>MSS</span> clamping in the scrub section. Each tunnel has different overhead (<span>GRE</span> adds more headers than <span>GIF</span>), so the <span>MSS</span> values differ. Getting this wrong causes mysterious connection stalls with large&nbsp;packets.</p>
<h2>The Downstream Server: Dual-Stack with Policy&nbsp;Routing</h2>
<p>This is where things get interesting. The <span>VPS</span>&nbsp;(<code>vps01</code>) already has provider-assigned IPv6 from its hoster. Jails on this server use addresses from both address&nbsp;spaces:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Provider IPv6</strong> (2001:db8:200:0:1000::/68) - the hoster’s addresses, NATed to the&nbsp;host</li>
<li><strong><span>BGP</span> IPv6</strong> (2a06:9801:1c:1000::/64) - our own prefix, routed natively via the <span>GIF</span>&nbsp;tunnel</li>
<li><strong>Private IPv4</strong> (10.254.254.0/24) - NATed to the host’s public&nbsp;IPv4</li>
</ul>
<p>The challenge: when a jail sends traffic from its <span>BGP</span> address (2a06:…), that traffic must exit through the <span>GIF</span> tunnel to the <span>BGP</span> router - not through the default route to the <span>VPS</span> provider, where it would be dropped as spoofed. But traffic from the provider address must continue using the normal default&nbsp;route.</p>
<p>The solution is <strong>dual-<span>FIB</span> policy routing</strong> - FreeBSD’s implementation of multiple routing&nbsp;tables.</p>
<h3>How Dual-<span>FIB</span>&nbsp;Works</h3>
<p>FreeBSD supports multiple routing tables called FIBs (Forwarding Information Bases). Each <span>FIB</span> is an independent routing table with its own default route and entries. Interfaces and <span>PF</span> rules can assign traffic to a specific <span>FIB</span>, and the kernel consults the appropriate table when&nbsp;forwarding.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>FIB 0 (default):
  default --&gt; vtnet0 --&gt; VPS provider upstream
  Used by: host traffic, provider-addressed jail traffic

FIB 1:
  default --&gt; gif0 --&gt; BGP router (router01)
  Used by: BGP-addressed jail traffic (2a06:9801:1c::/48)

<p>The <span>GIF</span> tunnel configuration deserves a closer&nbsp;look:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>ifconfig_gif0</span><span>=</span><span>"fib 1 tunnel 203.0.113.10 198.51.100.10 tunnelfib 0"</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This single line contains two critical&nbsp;directives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>fib 1</code></strong>: The tunnel interface itself lives in <span>FIB</span> 1. Traffic arriving on gif0 and traffic routed out gif0 consults routing table&nbsp;1.</li>
<li><strong><code>tunnelfib 0</code></strong>: But the outer IPv4 encapsulation (the 203.0.113.10 —&gt; 198.51.100.10 wrapper) uses <span>FIB</span> 0. This is essential - the IPv4 path to the <span>BGP</span> router goes through the provider’s default route in <span>FIB</span> 0.&nbsp;Without <code>tunnelfib 0</code>, the encapsulated packets would try to use <span>FIB</span> 1’s default route (which points at gif0 itself), creating a recursive&nbsp;loop.</li>
</ul>
<p>The three static routes in <span>FIB</span> 1 complete the&nbsp;picture:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>fib1default</code></strong>: Default route in <span>FIB</span> 1 exits through gif0 to the <span>BGP</span>&nbsp;router</li>
<li><strong><code>jailleak</code></strong>: Tells <span>FIB</span> 1 that the provider’s jail subnet is reachable via bastille0 (without this, return traffic in <span>FIB</span> 1 for jails’ provider addresses would try to exit through&nbsp;gif0)</li>
<li><strong><code>bgplink</code></strong>: Same for the <span>BGP</span> jail subnet - <span>FIB</span> 1 needs to know these addresses are local on&nbsp;bastille0</li>
</ul>
<h3><span>PF</span>: The Routing&nbsp;Glue</h3>
<p><span>PF</span> is where the address-based routing decision happens. When a jail sends a packet from a <span>BGP</span> address, <span>PF</span> assigns it to <span>FIB</span>&nbsp;1:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>#</span><span> </span><span>BGP</span><span>-</span><span>addressed</span><span> </span><span>jail</span><span> </span><span>traffic</span><span> </span><span>--</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>force</span><span> </span><span>into</span><span> </span><span>routing</span><span> </span><span>table</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>exits</span><span> </span><span>via</span><span> </span><span>gif0</span><span>)</span>
<span>pass</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span> </span><span>quick</span><span> </span><span>on</span><span> </span><span>bastille0</span><span> </span><span>inet6</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>$</span><span>bgp_net</span><span> </span><span>to</span><span> </span><span>any</span><span> </span><span>rtable</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>keep</span><span> </span><span>state</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>rtable 1</code> directive is the key. It tells <span>PF</span> to route matching packets using <span>FIB</span> 1 instead of the default <span>FIB</span> 0. Since <span>FIB</span> 1’s default route points out gif0 to the <span>BGP</span> router, these packets get encapsulated and sent to router01, which then forwards them to the internet with the correct source&nbsp;address.</p>
<p>For traffic arriving on the tunnel destined for jails, <span>PF</span>&nbsp;uses <code>reply-to</code> to ensure return traffic takes the same&nbsp;path:</p>

<p>Without <code>reply-to</code>, the kernel would consult <span>FIB</span> 0 for return traffic (since the jail itself isn’t in <span>FIB</span> 1), and replies to <span>BGP</span>-addressed connections would exit through vtnet0 with the wrong source routing - getting dropped as spoofed by the provider.&nbsp;The <code>reply-to</code> directive forces <span>PF</span> to send reply packets back out the interface they arrived on, to the specified&nbsp;next-hop.</p>
<h3>The Complete&nbsp;Picture</h3>
<p>Here’s how a request to a <span>BGP</span>-addressed jail service&nbsp;flows:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code> 1. Client sends packet to 2a06:9801:1c:1000::10 (web jail)
 2. Packet traverses the internet, reaching AS201379 via iFog or Lagrange
 3. router01 forwards it through gif0 tunnel to vps01
 4. vps01 receives proto 41 on vtnet0, decapsulates --&gt; gif0
 5. PF matches: reply-to ($tun_if $bgp_hub_ip), creates state
 6. Packet forwarded to bastille0 --&gt; jail
 7. Jail responds, packet exits on bastille0
 8. PF's state table triggers reply-to: send via gif0 to bgp_hub_ip
 9. gif0 encapsulates (proto 41) using FIB 0 to reach router01
10. router01 receives, forwards to upstream --&gt; internet --&gt; client
</code></pre></div>

<p>And for outbound connections initiated by the jail using its <span>BGP</span>&nbsp;address:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>1. Jail sends packet from 2a06:9801:1c:1000::10
2. Packet arrives on bastille0
3. PF matches: "from $bgp_net --&gt; rtable 1"
4. Kernel routes via FIB 1 --&gt; default route --&gt; gif0
5. gif0 encapsulates using FIB 0 --&gt; vtnet0 --&gt; router01
6. router01 receives, forwards to internet (source: 2a06:9801:1c:1000::10)
</code></pre></div>

<p>Meanwhile, the exact same jail can communicate using its provider address through the normal default route in <span>FIB</span> 0, with <span>NAT</span> to the host’s address. Both address spaces coexist on the same interface, differentiated purely by <span>PF</span> rules and <span>FIB</span>&nbsp;selection.</p>
<h2>Verification</h2>
<p>Once everything is running, verification is straightforward. From inside a jail with both&nbsp;addresses:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span># Traffic from the provider address - NATed through the hoster</span>
root@caddy:~<span> </span><span># curl --interface 2001:db8:200:0:1000::10 https://ifconfig.co</span>
<span>2001</span>:db8:200::2

<span># Traffic from the BGP address - routed natively through the tunnel</span>
root@caddy:~<span> </span><span># curl --interface 2a06:9801:1c:1000::10 https://ifconfig.co</span>
2a06:9801:1c:1000::10
</code></pre></div>

<p>The first request shows the host’s NATed provider address. The second shows the jail’s real <span>BGP</span> address - confirming the packet traversed the tunnel and reached the internet through <span>AS201379</span>.</p>
<p>A traceroute from an external host confirms the <span>BGP</span> path is&nbsp;working:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ mtr -rw 2a06:9801:1c:1000::10
HOST:                              Loss%   Snt   Last   Avg  Best  Wrst StDev
 1.|-- [local-gateway]               0.0%    10    2.6   5.5   2.6  14.1   3.6
    ...
 9.|-- [transit-provider-edge]       0.0%    10   33.8  46.2  33.8  81.2  19.0
10.|-- [ifog-peering-fabric]         0.0%    10   33.5  46.7  33.5  87.0  18.6
11.|-- 2001:db8:300::2               0.0%    10   44.3  59.1  41.9 136.7  33.2
12.|-- 2a06:9801:1c:ffff::2         0.0%    10   72.7  98.9  68.8 198.8  42.4
13.|-- 2a06:9801:1c:1000::10        0.0%    10  164.1  83.1  63.5 164.1  33.4
</code></pre></div>

<p>Traffic enters via the transit provider (hops 9-10), traverses the <span>GRE</span> tunnel to router01 (hop 11), then the <span>GIF</span> tunnel to vps01 (hop 12,&nbsp;the <code>2a06:9801:1c:ffff::2</code> link address), and finally reaches the jail (hop 13). The prefix also shows up correctly on bgp.tools as active and originated by <span>AS201379</span> with both upstreams&nbsp;visible.</p>
<h2>Lessons&nbsp;Learned</h2>
<p><strong><span>MSS</span> clamping is non-negotiable with tunnels.</strong> Every layer of encapsulation eats into the <span>MTU</span>. <span>GIF</span> adds 20 bytes (IPv4 header) to every packet. <span>GRE</span> adds more. If you don’t clamp the <span>TCP</span> <span>MSS</span>, large packets get fragmented or dropped, causing mysterious failures where small requests work but large transfers stall.&nbsp;Set <code>max-mss</code> in <span>PF</span>’s scrub rules for every tunnel interface, calculated as: <span>MTU</span> minus IPv6 header (40 bytes) minus <span>TCP</span> header (20&nbsp;bytes).</p>
<p><strong><span>FIB</span> separation is cleaner than source-based routing hacks.</strong> FreeBSD’s multi-<span>FIB</span> support is a first-class feature.&nbsp;Using <code>rtable</code> in <span>PF</span>&nbsp;and <code>fib</code>/<code>tunnelfib</code> on interfaces gives you full control over which routing table handles which traffic. It’s conceptually cleaner and more debuggable than alternatives like ip6tables <span>MARK</span> targets on&nbsp;Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Bogon filtering matters even for small networks.</strong> The internet is full of misconfigurations and occasional malice. Filtering inbound routes prevents your router from accepting nonsense that could black-hole traffic or worse. The cost is a few lines of configuration; the protection is&nbsp;real.</p>
<p><strong><code>reply-to</code> solves asymmetric routing.</strong> When traffic can arrive on multiple interfaces, the kernel’s default <span>FIB</span> selection for return traffic may choose the wrong path. <span>PF</span>’s <code>reply-to</code> directive forces replies back out the arrival interface, which is exactly what you need for tunnel overlay&nbsp;setups.</p>
<p><strong>Start with two upstreams.</strong> A single upstream means zero redundancy and no ability to do traffic engineering. Two upstreams give you failover and the ability to prefer one path over the other using <span>AS</span>-path prepending or communities. The operational complexity increase is&nbsp;minimal.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Running your own <span>AS</span> on the internet is more accessible than most people assume. The barrier isn’t technical complexity - it’s knowing that the option exists. A FreeBSD <span>VM</span>, <span>FRR</span>, a couple of tunnels, and some careful <span>PF</span> rules give you provider-independent addressing, real <span>BGP</span> peering, and a deeper understanding of how the internet actually&nbsp;works.</p>
<p>The dual-<span>FIB</span> approach on the downstream server is the piece I’m most satisfied with. It elegantly solves the “two address spaces, one server” problem without hacks: <span>BGP</span> traffic takes the tunnel, provider traffic takes the default route, and <span>PF</span>’s <code>rtable</code> directive makes the decision based purely on source address. Both paths coexist transparently, and the jails don’t need to know anything about the routing&nbsp;underneath.</p>
<p>Is it overkill for a blog? Absolutely. But the same infrastructure carries every service I run, and having addresses that survive provider migrations has already paid for itself in operational simplicity. Besides, there’s something deeply satisfying about seeing your own <span>AS</span> number show up in a&nbsp;traceroute.</p>

<p>The internet is a network of networks, and now you’re one of them.

Subject: Sad news: Dave Farber has passed away</p>
<p>We are heartbroken to report that our colleague -- our mentor, friend, and
conscience -- David J. Farber passed away suddenly at his home in Roppongi,
Tokyo. He left us on Saturday, Feb. 7, 2026, at the too-young age of 91.</p>
<p>To his son Manny, he was simply ???Dad???, his bedrock whom he will miss
immeasurably. They spoke almost daily by video throughout his time in
Japan, and shared special times on numerous visits. He is survived by son
Manny Farber and daughter-in-law Mei Xu, daughter-in-law Carol Hagan and
grandsons Nate Farber and Sam Farber. He was preceded in death by his wife
Gloria (G.G.) and son Joe Farber.</p>
<p>Dave???s career began with his education at Stevens Institute of Technology,
which he loved deeply and served as a Trustee. He joined the legendary Bell
Labs during its heyday, and worked at the Rand Corporation. Along the way,
among countless other activities, he served as Chief Technologist of the
U.S. Federal Communications Commission; became a proficient
(instrument-rated) pilot; and was an active board member of the Electronic
Frontier Foundation, a digital civil-liberties organization.</p>
<p>His professional accomplishments and impact are almost endless, but often
captured by one moniker: ???grandfather of the Internet,??? acknowledging the
foundational contributions made by his many students at the University of
California, Irvine; the University of Delaware; the University of
Pennsylvania; and Carnegie Mellon University</p>
<p>In 2018, at the age of 83, Dave moved to Japan to become Distinguished
Professor at Keio University and Co-Director of the Keio Cyber Civilization
Research Center (CCRC). He loved teaching, and taught his final class on
January 22, 2026.</p>
<p>At CCRC, one of his most enjoyable activities was co-hosting the IP-Asia
online gathering, which has met every Monday for more than five years and
has addressed many aspects of the impact of technology on civilization.
Dave thrived in Japan in every way.</p>
<p>We, the IP-Asia community, will gather for an online remembrance of Dave at
the usual time and place, 2100 JST on Monday, February 9, 2026.</p>
<p>It???s impossible to summarize a life and career as rich and long as Dave???s
in our few words here. And each of us, even those who knew him for decades,
represent just one facet of his life.  But because we are here at its end,
we have the sad duty of sharing this news. Further information and a more
formal obituary are forthcoming.</p>
<p>With condolences to Manny and the rest of the family,</p>
<p>Jiro Kokuryo
Cherry Wong
Kaori Suzuki
Rodney Van Meter
Dan Gillmor</p>
<p>Manny can be reached at manny.farber@gmail.com.</p>

		<p>If you use an Apple silicon Mac I’m sure you have been impressed by its performance. Whether you’re working with images, audio, video or building software, we’ve enjoyed a new turn of speed since the M1 on day 1. While most attribute this to their Performance cores, as it goes with the name, much is in truth the result of the unsung Efficiency cores, and how they keep background tasks where they should be.</p>
<p>To see what I mean, start your Apple silicon Mac up from the cold, and open Activity Monitor in its CPU view, with its CPU History window open as well. For the first five to ten minutes you’ll see its E cores are a wall of red and green with Spotlight’s indexing services, CGPDFService, mediaanalysisd, BackgroundShortcutRunner, Siri components, its initial Time Machine backup, and often an XProtect Remediator scan. Meanwhile its P cores are largely idle, and if you were to dive straight into using your working apps, there’s plenty of capacity for them to run unaffected by all that background mayhem.</p>

<p>It’s this stage that scares those who are still accustomed to using Intel Macs. Seeing processes using more than 100% CPU is terrifying, because they know that Intel cores can struggle under so much load, affecting user apps. But on an Apple silicon Mac, who notices or cares that there’s over a dozen mdworker processes each taking a good 50% CPU simultaneously? After all, this is what the Apple silicon architecture is designed for. Admittedly the impression isn’t helped by a dreadful piece of psychology, as those E cores at 100% are probably running at a frequency a quarter of those of P cores shown at the same 100%, making visual comparison <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2024/11/08/why-cpu-in-activity-monitor-isnt-what-you-think/">completely false</a>.</p>
<p>This is nothing new. Apple brought it to the iPhone 7 in 2016, in its first SoC with separate P and E cores. That’s an implementation of Arm’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_big.LITTLE" target="_blank">big.LITTLE</a> announced in 2011, and <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8368" target="_blank">development work at Cray</a> and elsewhere in the previous decade. What makes the difference in Apple silicon Macs is how threads are allocated to the two different CPU core types on the basis of a metric known as <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2025/05/09/what-is-quality-of-service-and-how-does-it-matter/">Quality of Service</a>, or QoS.</p>
<p>As with so much in today’s Macs, QoS has been around since <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/qualityofservice" target="_blank">OS X 10.10 Yosemite</a>, six years before it became so central in performance. When all CPU cores are the same, it has limited usefulness over more traditional controls like Posix’s <code>nice</code> scheduling priority. All those background tasks still have to be completed, and giving them a lower priority only prolongs the time they take on the CPU cores, and the period in which the user’s apps are competing with them for CPU cycles.</p>
<p>With the experience gained from its iPhones and other devices, Apple’s engineers had a better solution for future Macs. In addition to providing priority-based queues, QoS makes a fundamental distinction between those threads run in the foreground, and those of the background. While foreground threads will be run on P cores when they’re available, they can also be scheduled on E cores when necessary. But background threads aren’t normally allowed to run on P cores, even if they’re delayed by the load on the E cores they’re restricted to. We know this from our inability to promote existing background threads to run on P cores using St. Clair Software’s <a href="https://www.stclairsoft.com/AppTamer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Tamer</a> and the command tool <code>taskpolicy</code>.</p>
<p>This is why, even if you sit and watch all those background processes loading the E cores immediately after starting up, leaving the P cores mostly idle, macOS won’t try running them on its P cores. If it did, even if you wanted it to, the distinction between foreground and background, P and E cores would start to fall apart, our apps would suffer as a consequence, and battery endurance would decline. Gone are the days of <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2020/06/10/what-to-do-when-a-process-is-using-excessive-cpu/">crashing mdworker processes</a> bringing our Macs to their knees with a spinning beachball every few seconds.</p>
<p>If seeing all those processes using high % CPU can look scary, the inevitable consequence in terms of software architecture might seem terrifying. Rather than building monolithic apps, many of their tasks are now broken out into discrete processes run in the background on demand, on the E cores when appropriate. The fact that an idle Mac has over 2,000 threads running in over 600 processes is good news, and the more of those that are run on the E cores, the faster our apps will be. The first and last M-series chips to have only two E cores were the M1 Pro and Max, since when every one has had at least four E cores, and some as many as six or eight.</p>
<p>Because Efficiency cores get the background threads off the cores we need for performance.</p>

<p>What if this is as good as software is ever going to be? What if AI stops getting better and what if people stop caring?</p>

<p>Imagine if this is as good as AI gets. If this is where it stops, you'd still have models that can almost code a web browser, almost code a compiler—and can even present a pretty cool demo if allowed to take a few shortcuts. You'd still get models that can kinda-sorta simulate worlds and write kinda-sorta engaging stories. You'd still get self-driving cars that almost work, except when they don't. You get AI that can make you like 90% of a thing!</p>
<p>90% is a lot. Will you care about the last 10%?</p>
<p>I'm terrified that you won't.</p>
<p>I'm terrified of the <em>good enough to ship</em>—and I'm terrified of nobody else caring. I'm less afraid of AI agents writing apps that they will never experience than I am of the AI herders who won't care enough to actually learn what they ship. And I sure as hell am afraid of the people who will experience the slop and will be fine with it.</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://ezhik.jp/losing-the-plot-that-was-never-there">woodworking enthusiast</a> I am slowly making my peace with standing in the middle of an IKEA. But at the rate things are going in this dropshipping hell, IKEA would be the dream. Software <em>temufication</em> stings much more than software commoditization.</p>

<p>I think Claude and friends can help with crafting good software and with learning new technologies and programming languages—though I sure as hell move slower when I stop to learn and understand than the guy playing Dwarf Fortress with 17 agents. But at the same time AI models seem to constantly nudge towards that same median Next-React-Tailwind, <em>good enough</em> app. These things just don't handle going off the beaten path well.</p>

<p>Mind you, it's not like slop is anything new. A lot of human decisions had to happen before your backside ended up in an extremely uncomfortable chair, your search results got polluted by poorly-written SEO-optimized articles, and your brain had to deal with a ticket booking website with a user interface so poorly designed that it made you cry. So it's a people problem. Incentives just don't seem to align to make good software. Move fast and break things, etc, etc. You'll make a little artisan app, and if it's any good, Google will come along with a free clone, kill you, then kill its clone—and the world will be left with net zero new good software. And now, with AI agents, it gets even worse as agent herders can do the same thing much faster.</p>
<p>Developers aside, there's also the users. AI models can't be imaginative, and the developers can't afford to, but surely with AI tools, the gap between <em>users</em> and <em>developers</em> will be bridged, ChatGPT will become the new HyperCard and people will turn their ideas into reality with just a few sentences? There's so many people out there who are coding without knowing it, from Carol in Accounting making insane Excel spreadsheets to all the kids on TikTok automating their phones with Apple Shortcuts and hacking up cool Notion notebooks.</p>
<p>But what if those people are an aberration? What if this state of <em>tech learned helplessness</em> cannot be fixed? What if people really do just want a glorified little TV in their pocket? What if most people truly just don't care about tech problems, about privacy, about Liquid Glass, about Microsoft's upsells, about constantly dealing with apps and features which just <em>don't work</em>? What if there will be nobody left to carry the torch? What if the future of computing belongs not to artisan developers or Carol from Accounting, but to whoever can churn out the most software out the fastest? What if <em>good enough</em> really is good enough for most people?</p>
<p>I'm terrified that our craft will die, and nobody will even care to mourn it.</p> <h2>🦔 🦔 🦔</h2> <center><sub><time>2026-02-08</time>  • <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Ezhik/116034520904489092">Discuss on Mastodon</a> • <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:png3xhpd6ccblcrcrxsxmfrs/post/3medprdipoc2l">Discuss on Bluesky</a></sub></center></article></main></div></div>]]></description>

            <p>PORTLAND — Under an acrylic case in an <a href="https://www.oregoncontemporary.org/a-larger-reality?ref=hyperallergic.com">exhibition</a> I curated about my mother, the writer Ursula K. Le Guin (1929–2018), sits the first typewriter she purchased. Compact and impossibly heavy, the machine comes from an era of word production so distant as to feel alien. The keyboard has no exclamation point. To create the favorite punctuation of tyrants and optimists, one must type an apostrophe, then backspace and type a period.</p><p>The Underwood waited in my parents’ attic for decades as Ursula and the world moved on to electronic typewriters and eventually to computers. I hoped visitors to <em>A Larger Reality</em>, at Oregon Contemporary through February 8, could experience a little of the residual magic that I find clings to it, pecking out whatever they please, taking home the original and leaving a carbon copy for posterity.</p><figure><img src="https://hyperallergic.com/content/images/2026/01/ursula-le-guin-typewriter.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1592" srcset="https://hyperallergic.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/ursula-le-guin-typewriter.jpg 600w, https://hyperallergic.com/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/ursula-le-guin-typewriter.jpg 1000w, https://hyperallergic.com/content/images/size/w1600/2026/01/ursula-le-guin-typewriter.jpg 1600w, https://hyperallergic.com/content/images/2026/01/ursula-le-guin-typewriter.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Ursula K. Le Guin's Underwood typewriter (photo by Mario Gallucci, courtesy Oregon Contemporary)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I’m happiest when the case is removed and the gallery is filled with the sound of metal meeting paper. Visitors who’ve never used a manual typewriter, or who don’t touch type, peck tentatively. Others engage physically, producing the familiar percussive <em>clack-clack</em> sound of my childhood. Either way, I feel I’m sharing not just a machine but a sacred trust with strangers who love <a href="https://www.loa.org/news-and-views/1375-fellow-writers-remember-ursula-k-le-guin-1929-2018/?ref=hyperallergic.com">my mother’s writing and words in general</a>.</p><p>People type poetry, memoir, fiction, epistles, articles, political statements, and fan mail on the Underwood. Some offer short tributes to Ursula or variations on “I can’t believe I’m typing on Ursula K. Le Guin’s typewriter.” Others compose prose or poetry on the spot. A few write nothing, go home to draft several pages, and return later to type something polished.</p><figure><img src="https://hyperallergic.com/content/images/2026/01/ursula-note.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1328" srcset="https://hyperallergic.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/ursula-note.jpg 600w, https://hyperallergic.com/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/ursula-note.jpg 1000w, https://hyperallergic.com/content/images/size/w1600/2026/01/ursula-note.jpg 1600w, https://hyperallergic.com/content/images/2026/01/ursula-note.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>A scan of one of Le Guin's replies to fan mail (image courtesy Ursula K. Le Guin Foundation)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One visitor’s letter wondered how Ursula would feel knowing that her writing and cultural presence are no longer her own after death. The question is apt for me as curator and literary executor. Even a very private writer, while she is alive, exercises a restraining influence on people’s ability to misinterpret her words or life story. I can take comfort in my mother’s respect for the agency and necessity of readers in creating literature. For many years, her stock fan mail reply was a thank-you note, in her handwriting, acknowledging that “a book is just a box of words until a reader opens it.”</p><p>Over the past year, I’ve experienced cycles of grief and joy as I pored over my mother’s letters, manuscripts, and drawings to exhibit. I listened to hours of her voice, recreated an oak tree from her childhood and the room she wrote in from my childhood home. Curating an exhibition about your parent is a strange experience. Many visitors intuit this; the most common question I’m asked about the exhibition is what my mother would think about it.</p><figure><img src="https://hyperallergic.com/content/images/2026/01/OX-A-Larger-Reality-DZ2_3002-web.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1321" srcset="https://hyperallergic.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/OX-A-Larger-Reality-DZ2_3002-web.jpg 600w, https://hyperallergic.com/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/OX-A-Larger-Reality-DZ2_3002-web.jpg 1000w, https://hyperallergic.com/content/images/size/w1600/2026/01/OX-A-Larger-Reality-DZ2_3002-web.jpg 1600w, https://hyperallergic.com/content/images/2026/01/OX-A-Larger-Reality-DZ2_3002-web.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Muralist Ursula Barton's 38-foot-long (~11.6-meter-long) painting of a dragon on the gallery walls (photo by Mario Gallucci, courtesy Oregon Contemporary)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Honestly, I have no idea. I’ve learned not to second-guess my decisions by constantly asking myself, “What would Ursula do?” I would never have proposed this exhibition in her lifetime, for fear that she might see it as reductionist. This is, after all, a writer who said in an <a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6253/the-art-of-fiction-no-221-ursula-k-le-guin?ref=hyperallergic.com">interview</a>, “Don’t shove me into your damn pigeonhole, where I don’t fit, because I’m all over. My tentacles are coming out of the pigeonhole in all directions.” Biographical and retrospective exhibitions exist in large part to assert and codify who an artist is. That is, at some level, a type of pigeon-holing.</p><p>This icon-production takes various forms, from hagiography to “objective” centrism to critique. True, if anyone is going to codify my mother, I prefer it to be me. I’m granted an advantage due to proximity and memory. But my version of Ursula is just one version. Even her version of herself was not authoritative. My mother remade herself, through her art, constantly and over decades. She revised everything from her early centering of male characters, to her <a href="https://lareviewofbooks.org/blog/essays/left-hand-darkness-light-metoo/?ref=hyperallergic.com">use of he/him</a> as the default pronoun in an imagined ambisexual world, to <a href="https://www.ursulakleguin.com/blog/95-are-they-going-to-say-this-is-fantasy?ref=hyperallergic.com">her critique</a> of a Kazuo Ishiguro novel. Rather than worship an immutable icon, we should aspire to her willingness to learn and change.</p><figure><img src="https://hyperallergic.com/content/images/2026/01/OX-A-Larger-Reality-DZ2_2927-web.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://hyperallergic.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/OX-A-Larger-Reality-DZ2_2927-web.jpg 600w, https://hyperallergic.com/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/OX-A-Larger-Reality-DZ2_2927-web.jpg 1000w, https://hyperallergic.com/content/images/size/w1600/2026/01/OX-A-Larger-Reality-DZ2_2927-web.jpg 1600w, https://hyperallergic.com/content/images/2026/01/OX-A-Larger-Reality-DZ2_2927-web.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Installation view of </span><i><em>A Larger Reality</em></i><span> at Oregon Contemporary (photo by Mario Gallucci, courtesy Oregon Contemporary)</span></figcaption></figure><p>From a technical, curatorial perspective, however, the mandate of narrative was my greatest hindrance. We’ve had it drummed into us that humans learn through stories, so anyone in an educative role must tell a story. For biographical exhibitions, however, linearity flattens the subject and condescends to the audience. I would go so far as to say this may be true for linearity imposed on any kind of exhibition.</p><p>My mother had something useful to say on this subject. Her essay <a href="http://bookshop.org/a/539/9781838003982?ref=hyperallergic.com"><em>The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction</em></a><em> </em>(1986)<em>, </em>long a touchstone for writers, has recently become one for curators as well. Ursula posits, to simplify, that the reduction of narrative to linear, techno-heroic stories of conflict and conquest doesn’t serve us well. The hero’s journey remains a default model for storytelling in our culture, including for exhibitions. Ursula argues that the carrier bag, a humble yet capacious tool for gathering, is a better model for storytelling.</p><figure><img src="https://hyperallergic.com/content/images/2026/01/urs.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://hyperallergic.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/urs.jpg 600w, https://hyperallergic.com/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/urs.jpg 1000w, https://hyperallergic.com/content/images/size/w1600/2026/01/urs.jpg 1600w, https://hyperallergic.com/content/images/2026/01/urs.jpg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>The scales on Barton's dragon mural contain snippets of photos, book covers, and other visual ephemera from Le Guin's life. (photo by Mario Gallucci, courtesy Oregon Contemporary)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Exhibitions can be superb carrier bags for culture and knowledge. Few experiences offer so many chances for discursion and recursion, negative space and introspection. A carrier bag can expand to make room for the needs of the moment, for participation, spectacle, and immersion. In a carrier bag, none of these qualities, in balance, is antithetical.</p><p>For my part, releasing myself from the need to tell a tidy story about my mother led to an exhibition that is wordy, baggy, and inconclusive — but also, I believe, engaging and true to the subject.</p>
