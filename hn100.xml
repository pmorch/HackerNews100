                    <h2>We're making new Pebble watches</h2>
                    <p>I've tried pretty much every other smartwatch on Earth, yet I still wear my Pebble every day—nothing else matches its features and long battery life. I really, <em>really</em>, <strong><em>really</em></strong> hoped someone else would create a proper replacement, but no one has stepped up, and my stash of old Pebbles is dwindling!</p>
                    <p>It's time to take matters into my own hands. A small team and I are working on a new Pebble-like smartwatch that runs open source PebbleOS, has the same beloved features (plus some fun new stuff), and stays true to the core Pebble vision. If enough people are interested, we'll build it. <a href="https://repebble.com/signup.html">Sign up</a> to get one!</p>

                    <h2>PebbleOS is now open source</h2>
                    <p>Google (which purchased Fitbit, which had bought Pebble) still owns PebbleOS. Over the last year, a team inside Google (including some amazing ex-Pebblers turned Googlers) has been working on open sourcing the OS! The source code for PebbleOS is now available at <a href="https://github.com/google/pebble" target="_blank">github.com/google/pebble</a>. Read more on their <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2025/01/see-code-that-powered-pebble-smartwatches.html" target="_blank">blog</a>.</p>
                    <p>Thank you so much, Google! I can't stress how thankful I am to the individuals who did the heavy lifting. This was also made possible by the <a href="https://rebble.io/" target="_blank">Rebble</a> team and community, who have supported Pebble since it shut down. Check out the vibrant <a href="https://reddit.com/r/pebble" target="_blank">r/Pebble</a> and <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/aRUAYFN" target="_blank">Discord</a>.</p>

                    <p>Anyone can use PebbleOS in any way they want. You can get it working on existing Pebble watches, emulate it, run it on other embedded devices, or create new hardware specifically for it. <a href="https://github.com/pebble-dev/pebbleos" target="_blank">Learn more</a> about PebbleOS.</p>

<p>This is part of an effort from Google to help and support the <a href="https://rebble.io/" target="_blank">volunteers</a> who have come together to maintain functionality for Pebble watches after the original company ceased operations in 2016.</p><br>

<h3><b>A quick look back</b></h3>

<p>Pebble was initially launched through a very successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/getpebble/pebble-e-paper-watch-for-iphone-and-android" target="_blank">Kickstarter project</a>. Pebble’s first Kickstarter was the single most funded at the time, and its successor Kickstarter for the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/getpebble/pebble-time-awesome-smartwatch-no-compromises" target="_blank">Pebble Time</a> repeated that feat – and remains the second most funded today! Over the course of four years, Pebble sold over two million smartwatches, cultivating a thriving community of thousands of developers who created over ten thousand Pebble apps and watchfaces.</p>

<p>In 2016, Fitbit acquired Pebble, including Pebble’s intellectual property. Later on, Fitbit itself was acquired by Google, taking the Pebble OS with it.</p>

<p>Despite the Pebble hardware and software support being discontinued eight years ago, Pebble still has thousands of dedicated fans.</p><br>

<h3><b>What is being released</b></h3>

<p>We are releasing most of the source code for the Pebble operating system. This repository contains the entire OS, which provides all the standard smartwatch functionality – notifications, media controls, fitness tracking, and support for custom apps and watchfaces – on tiny ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers. Built with <a href="https://www.freertos.org/" target="_blank">FreeRTOS</a>, it contains multiple modules for memory management, graphics, and timekeeping, as well as an extensive framework to load and run custom applications written in C, as well as in Javascript via the <a href="https://jerryscript.net/" target="_blank">Jerryscript</a> Javascript engine. The Pebble architecture allowed for a lightweight system delivering a rich user experience as well as a very long battery life.</p>

<p>It's important to note that some proprietary code was removed from this codebase, particularly for chipset support and the Bluetooth stack. This means the code being released contains all the build system files (using the <a href="https://waf.io/" target="_blank">waf</a> build system), but it will not compile or link as released.</p><br>

<h3><b>The path forward</b></h3>

<p>From here, we are hoping this release will assist the dedicated community and volunteers from the <a href="https://rebble.io/" target="_blank">Rebble project</a> to carry forward the support for Pebble watches that users still love. For someone to build a new firmware update, there is a non-trivial amount of work to do in finding replacements for the pieces that were stripped out of this code, as well as updating this source code that has not been maintained for a few years.</p>

        <p>Today we’re excited to announce several developments which will affect the future of Rebble. Let’s get straight into it, starting with the big one…</p>

<h2 id="-google-open-sources-tintin">🎉 Google Open Sources Tintin</h2>

<p><img src="https://rebble.io/images/tintin-blog-post/the-loop.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Today Google <a href="https://github.com/google/pebble">announced that they have released the source code to PebbleOS</a>. This is massive for Rebble, 
and will accelerate our efforts to produce new hardware.</p>

<p>Previously, we have been working on our own replacement firmware: <a href="https://github.com/pebble-dev/RebbleOS">RebbleOS</a>. As you can see by the commit history though, progress was slow.
Building a production-ready realtime OS for the Pebble is no small feat, and although we were confident we’d get there given enough time, it was never our ideal path.
Thanks to the hard work of many people both within Google and not, we finally have our hands on the original source code for PebbleOS. You can read <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2025/01/see-code-that-powered-pebble-smartwatches.html">Google’s blog post on this for even more information.</a></p>

<p>This does <em>not</em> mean we instantly have the ability to start developing updates for PebbleOS though, we first will need to spend some concentrated time getting it to build. 
But before we talk about that, let’s talk about Rebble itself.</p>

<!--more-->



<p>With a long term plan for the Rebble community starting to coalesce, the
longevity of Rebble is more important than ever.  We’re excited to say that
Rebble is transforming into a non-profit to formalize what we’ve all always
hoped for: the community (that’s you!) are the owners of Rebble!  Rebble has
always been about preserving these humble little smartwatches as a little
oasis of user-respectful technology in a desert of big corporations trying
to sell your attention, and we’re excited to have a legal framework that
lets us codify our missions of: educating people about why these are
important; using them as a platform to teach embedded systems; preserving
the history of this quirky little platform; and building open source
software for the public good to keep the dream going long into the future.</p>

<p>It’s still early days, but more information will be available at <a href="https://rebble.foundation/">rebble.foundation</a> as soon<img title=":tm:" alt=":tm:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2122.png" height="20" width="20"> as we have it. 
In the mean time, expect more hackathons from us, now that we have a
framework to run them!  Oh, and speaking of which…</p>

<h2 id="-the-rebbleos-hackathon">💻 The RebbleOS Hackathon</h2>

<p><img src="https://rebble.io/images/tintin-blog-post/hackathon-002.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>The <a href="https://rebble.io/2023/05/12/a-look-back-at-the-rebble-hackathon.html">last Rebble hackathon</a> was so much fun, and we’ve been wanting to do another for some time. 
The Rebble project is a fantastic example of what community can achieve, and we intend to build on this in 2025 and beyond.</p>

<p>Writing Pebble apps is a fantastic way to delve into the world of embedded systems, and what better way to do that than with a hackathon?</p>

<p>Mark your calendars for the <strong>1st - 8th of March</strong> as we work on RebbleOS and other apps, and encourage you to do the same!</p>

<p>For more information see <a href="https://rebble.io/hackathon-002">/hackathon-002</a></p>

<h2 id="-old-dog-new-tricks">🐶 Old Dog, New Tricks</h2>

<p><img src="https://rebble.io/images/tintin-blog-post/snowy.png" alt=""></p>

<p>We’re also happy to announce that we’ve acquired the <a href="https://github.com/pebble-dev/snowy">source code for Snowy</a>! 
<a href="https://apps.rebble.io/en_US/application/561960c8a1dd2652af00000d">Snowy</a> was one of the most popular assistants for the Pebble, and is still a useful companion today.
However, given the current landscape of LLMs and voice assistants it is definitely due an upgrade, so expect to see this old dog appear in the hackathon.</p>

<h2 id="️-thats-all-for-now">🗒️ That’s all for now</h2>

<p>Between everything above, and the fact that progress continues on our replacement mobile app, the future of Rebble has never looked so bright. We are committed to an open-source community-owned smartwatch, and these announcements bring that reality even closer.
A huge thank you to everyone in the Pebble-verse who made this happen, especially those internal to Google who have helped ensure PebbleOS’s future. We’d like to especially thank Liam McLoughlin and Matthieu Jeanson, as well as Rebble superstar Katharine Berry. Thank you also to the many other Googlers who made this possible – and a massive shout out to Eric Migicovsky for ensuring this happened (and for creating Pebble in the first place).</p>

<p>One more shoutout: we would like to thank, of course, you!  Without all of you Rebblers who have been entrusting us for the past 8 years to keep the dream of an open-platform user-respectful smartwatch alive, PebbleOS wouldn’t be relevant at all today.  Your cumulative $3s a month have reminded the world that Pebble is worth preserving, and worth building on.  We love this platform, and we’re glad that you do too.  Thank you so much.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more updates as the Hackathon launches, and when we have the first working versions of the new RebbleOS!</p>

<p>- Will ❤️</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>For the past two weeks or so, I've been working on constructing the Taylorator. The Taylorator is a piece of software which allows me to flood the FM broadcast band with Taylor Swift's music. No matter where you tune your radio, you will only be able to listen to her!</p>
<p>Okay, I admit that you could technically use the Taylorator to broadcast whatever music you want, so maybe it's a bit of a misnomer. But for some reason I figured this would be funnier.</p><p>What do I mean by flooding the FM broadcast band? Well, in Canada and the US (and maybe other places too), the FM broadcast band spans 88 MHz - 108 MHz. You can't broadcast wherever, though. Stations will only appear on odd-numbered frequencies, like 88.1 MHz, 94.5 MHz, 107.3 MHz, etc. There's a technical reason for this - every FM broadcast takes up about 150 KHz of bandwidth, and spacing the broadcasts like this allows for an extra 50 KHz of wiggle room.</p><p>This also works out to 100 different frequencies that we need to populate (with 100 different songs). So, how can we accomplish this?</p></section><h2>Software Defined Radio</h2><section><p>SDR, or Software Defined Radio, is a paradigm where you do most of your signal processing in software, and then a relatively dumb piece of hardware creates a real-world signal from this virtual signal. It works similarly to a sound card. It takes in a series of samples, and spits out a waveform that matches these samples.</p><p><a href="https://www.scd31.com/img/taylorator/limesdr.png"><img src="https://www.scd31.com/thumb/taylorator/limesdr.png"></a></p><p>They make SDRs that can transmit, receive, or do both. For this project we don't care about receive, and only need to be able to transmit. I chose to use a LimeSDR mini, because it can transmit, has a wide enough bandwidth, and I already had it lying around.</p><p>One important difference between a sound card and an SDR is that a sound card takes real-valued samples, and an SDR takes complex-valued samples. That is to say, each SDR sample can be presented as a single number <code>a + bi</code>, where <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are real numbers. This is primarily done because it cuts the required sample rate in half, as it allows for negative frequencies. On the hardware side, this results in a simpler design, which lowers cost.</p></section><h2>Audio preparation</h2><section><p>There are a few things we need to do to our raw audio to prepare it for modulation. First of all, we want the sample rate of all of our different songs to be the same. I chose 44.1 KHz as the target sample rate, but 48 KHz would also be a sane value (or anything else, really). I wrote a rational resampler which does this by upsampling, linear interpolating, and decimating to the target sample rate.</p><p>Next, we need to run our audio through a low-pass filter and perform FM-preemphasis. I won't touch on low-pass filtering much, but FM-preemphasis is basically just a high-pass filter. The idea is that random atmospheric noise, when demoulated by an FM receiver, is biased towards high frequencies. We can get around this by boosting our high frequencies on transmit (pre-emphasis) and having the receiver attenuate the same frequencies (de-emphasis).</p><p>This is all done before the modulation actually starts. Modulation takes a ton of CPU power so we want to pre-compute whatever we can.</p></section><h2>FM modulation in software</h2><section><p>FM modulation follows a pretty simple formula. Basically, <code>y_n = e^(i*pi*sum(x))</code>, where <code>y_n</code> is the output sample, and <code>x</code> is the input audio stream up until this point. (Sorry, my blog doesn't support LaTeX! Maybe I should add that...) In other words, we're rotating around a circle, and the speed at which we rotate around this circle is dictated by the sum of all the audio samples we've seen up until this point. In the complex world, rotation speed is analogous to frequency, so this is all we need to build an FM modulator!</p><p>In practice, though, this is actually pretty difficult for our use-case. We need to modulate 100 audio streams at once. Each one needs to be offset by up to +/- 10 MHz, so we need to sample at 20MSPS. Performance was the name of the game, and I spent probably a week banging my head against my computer in order to get it to an acceptable level. Huge thanks to my friend Won, who gave me a ton of different ideas to try.</p><p>The current architecture modulates all audio channels at once, so we only need to write to our output array once (instead of reading/writing 100 times). The modulator is also responsible for "biasing" each channel to be centered around a different frequency. This used to be done as a separate stage but doing it as part of modulation sped things up significantly. Finally, rather than computing trig operations, a lookup table is generated which converts between phase angle and its complex number representation. This lookup table is also gain-compensated, so that when we add up the 100 outputs, we don't end up clipping.</p><p>I'm not convinced that I'm operating anywhere close to peak efficiency. There may be some huge DSP-specific shortcut that I'm overlooking - I'm certainly no expert. But the current code works well enough.</p></section><h2>Performance</h2><section><p>Due to the increase in required sample rate, as well as the increase in number of channels, required processing power grows at O(n^2), where n represents the amount of bandwidth we're covering.</p><p>On my laptop, which has a 10th-gen i5 CPU, I can only get to about 0.5x real-time performance if I target the entire FM broadcast band (88 MHz - 108 MHz). However, if I decrease that slightly to 88 - 104 MHz, then my laptop is able to handle it at slightly better than real-time.</p><p>My desktop, with a Ryzen 2700x CPU, fares better. Even only using a few cores, it can easily manage 2x real-time performance or more. This is a 7-year-old CPU, so the bar isn't actually too high here.</p><p>Memory usage is also pretty high. Since we're loading all songs into memory and pre-computing beforehand, it can take a few gigabytes to hold everything. With my music, I've noticed around 3.5 GB of RAM usage. On top of this, there's also per-thread RAM usage, though it should be less significant. There's certainly room for improvement here. Just changing how audio is stored could cut this usage in half, or more.</p></section><h2>Legality</h2><section><p>Whenever I told someone about the Taylorator during its development, the question I'd consistently get asked is, "is this legal?". This is going to depend on exactly where you live and exactly how you're using the Taylorator, but in general, I think the answer is... probably not.</p><p>There are generally cut-outs for very low power FM transmitters, like the ones people use in their car. Usually, though, this requires the transmitter itself to be licensed, and of course, the software I have written has no such license.</p><p>In practice, it's probably not a huge deal? A few mW spread over 20 MHz of bandwidth results in a pretty weak signal. Obviously, don't do illegal things (and if you do, don't tell me about it)! If you connected your SDR up to an amplifier you would almost certainly get in a bunch of trouble. So, uh, don't do that.</p></section><h2>Source Code</h2><section><p>As always, this project is <a href="https://gitlab.scd31.com/stephen/taylorator">open source</a>!</p></section></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2022, I had an idea that could decrease the size of all newly-published npm packages by about 5%, and it was completely backwards compatible. This would have improved performance and reduced storage costs.</p><p>I eagerly pitched this idea to the npm maintainers, convinced it was a clear win. But after a few months, my proposal was rejected. To be clear: <em>I think this was the right call!</em></p><p>Here’s what happened. I hope this story will be useful to others.</p><h2 id="technical-background">Technical background</h2><p>Two things to know before diving in: how npm packages are distributed, and about the Zopfli compressor.</p><h3 id="npm-packages-are-just-gzipped-tarballs">npm packages are just gzipped tarballs</h3><p>First thing to know: npm packages are distributed as tar archives compressed with gzip. In other words, they’re just <code>.tar.gz</code> or <code>.tgz</code> files.</p><p>You can download these archives using <code>npm pack $PACKAGE_NAME</code>:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>npm pack express &amp;&amp; ls
</span></span><span><span><span># =&gt; express-4.21.2.tgz</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If you <a href="https://evanhahn.com/mnemonic-to-remember-tar-commands/">extract this tarball</a>, you’ll see all of the package’s files, such as <code>package.json</code>.</p><h3 id="zopfli-a-gzip-compatible-compressor">Zopfli, a gzip-compatible compressor</h3><p>The second thing to know about: <a href="https://github.com/google/zopfli">Zopfli</a>.</p><p>Zopfli can create gzip-compatible data that’s smaller than other tools can. For example, compare the <code>zopfli</code> command to the <code>gzip</code> command:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>gzip -9 romeo_and_juliet.txt
</span></span><span><span>du -h romeo_and_juliet.txt.gz
</span></span><span><span><span># =&gt; 64K     romeo_and_juliet.txt.gz</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>zopfli romeo_and_juliet.txt
</span></span><span><span>du -h romeo_and_juliet.txt.gz
</span></span><span><span><span># =&gt; 60K     romeo_and_juliet.txt.gz</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As you can see, <code>zopfli</code> produces smaller files than <code>gzip</code>.</p><p>If Zopfli produces smaller sizes than gzip, why not use it everywhere? Unfortunately, Zopfli is great but it’s <em>much</em> slower than regular gzip.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>time gzip -9 romeo_and_juliet.txt
</span></span><span><span><span># =&gt; real   0m0.016s</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>time zopfli romeo_and_juliet.txt
</span></span><span><span><span># =&gt; real   0m0.462s</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this simple test, Zopfli is about <em>28 times slower</em>! That means it’s bad for content that changes a lot, but good for content that doesn’t.</p><p>In my opinion, Zopfli’s killer feature is that it creates files that are backwards compatible with existing decompressors. Other compression algorithms, like LZMA, can be better than gzip, but you can’t decompress their results with <code>gunzip</code> or equivalent. With Zopfli, you can!</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>cat my_file.txt
</span></span><span><span><span># =&gt; Hello world</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>lzma -c my_file.txt | gunzip -c
</span></span><span><span><span># =&gt; gunzip: unknown compression format</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>zopfli -c my_file.txt | gunzip -c
</span></span><span><span><span># =&gt; Hello world</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So I wondered: if npm packages are compressed with gzip, <strong>could npm packages be compressed better with Zopfli?</strong> The answer is “yes”.</p><h2 id="proof-of-concept">Proof of concept</h2><p>To see if this would work, I tried it on one of my own npm packages.</p><p>I did something like this:</p><ol><li><p>Get the file that is published by default. I used <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/humanize-duration">HumanizeDuration.js</a>, one of my more popular packages, as a test.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>cd HumanizeDuration.js
</span></span><span><span>npm pack
</span></span><span><span><span># ...</span>
</span></span><span><span><span># =&gt; humanize-duration-3.32.1.tgz</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This created <code>humanize-duration-3.32.1.tgz</code>, which was ~17 kibibytes large. I could <code>npm publish</code> this right now, but let’s try shrinking it.</p></li><li><p>Decompress (but don’t unarchive) the file.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>gunzip humanize-duration-3.32.1.tgz
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This leaves us with an uncompressed tarball, <code>humanize-duration-3.32.1.tar</code>.</p></li><li><p>Re-compress it with Zopfli.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>zopfli humanize-duration-3.32.1.tar
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As expected, this produced a slightly smaller file by over a kilobyte. That’s promising!</p></li><li><p>Make sure I could still install it. I installed the tarball, and tried to use it.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>cd <span>"</span><span>$(</span>mktemp -d<span>)</span><span>"</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>npm install /path/to/recompressed/humanize-duration-3.32.1.tar.gz
</span></span><span><span><span># =&gt; added 1 package in 123ms</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>node -p <span>'require("humanize-duration")(1234)'</span>
</span></span><span><span><span># =&gt; 1.234 seconds</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It worked!</p></li></ol><p>This saved 1114 bytes for a ~6.2% reduction. And this is completely backwards-compatible. That made sense; this is what Zopfli is supposed to do!</p><p>I also tried it on a few of my other packages. Everything seemed to work and offered a ~5% size reduction. Great!</p><p>I published one of my modules this way, and nobody complained. I later did this for <a href="https://helmetjs.github.io/">Helmet</a>, my <a href="https://evanhahn.com/lessons-learned-maintaining-a-sorta-popular-open-source-package/">most popular module</a>—again, without issue.</p><p>This was, and still is, a minor success. This is a small optimization that saves about 2 gigabytes of bandwidth per year across all installations. I doubt many individual installs were perceptibly faster after this change…but it’s nice to do a tiny amount of work for a 5% improvement!</p><p>Now that I’d proved it’d work for my modules, I wondered: <em>could this be done on a wider scale?</em></p><h2 id="2022-05-27-asking-for-feedback">2022-05-27: asking for feedback</h2><p>Given that this worked fine for my packages, could this be done for the <em>entire npm registry</em>?</p><p>On May 27, I asked my <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> colleagues for feedback on an idea. Here’s what I asked (reformatted slightly):</p><blockquote><p>Here is something I would like feedback on:</p><p>npm packages are just gzipped tarballs (try it yourself with <code>npm pack $PACKAGE_NAME</code>).</p><p>Zopfli does a better job at gzipping files than <code>gzip -9</code>.</p><p>Therefore, the npm registry and developers could save bandwidth if they compressed new (or re-compressed existing) packages with Zopfli.</p><p>With React as an example:</p><ul><li>The latest version of React is 81,166 bytes, compressed with the equivalent of <code>gzip -9</code></li><li>Re-compressing it with Zopfli saves 4019 bytes; about a 5% reduction</li><li>React was downloaded ~562M times last year</li><li>That would save ~2 TiB of bandwidth just for React</li></ul><p>To be clear, this is completely backwards compatible as far as I understand.</p></blockquote><p>I got two important pieces of feedback:</p><ul><li><a href="https://belkadan.com/about">Jordan Rose</a> pointed out that decompression time could be significant. I hadn’t checked this! I ran some quick tests and found that this wasn’t an issue.</li><li><a href="https://fosstodon.org/@indutny">Fedor Indutny</a> pointed out that npm’s lockfile, <code>package-lock.json</code>, contains a checksum of the package file. The npm people couldn’t easily re-compress existing packages without breaking things. It would only work for newly-published files; new packages or new versions of existing ones.</li></ul><p>Armed with that feedback, I brought the idea to the npm folks.</p><h2 id="2022-05-29-rfc-time">2022-05-29: RFC time</h2><p>I learned that the npm CLI people have <a href="#TODO">a formal proposal process</a> where you write up a document and submit a patch.</p><p>I spent a few days writing and editing my proposal, <a href="https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/595">“Improving tarball compression while maintaining backwards compatibility”</a>. It was 708 words. I tried to make it sound compelling with things like this:</p><blockquote><p>Even a small savings, like 5%, would reduce the registry’s bandwidth usage by multiple terabytes. For example: React&nbsp;<a href="https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=react&amp;from=2021-01-01&amp;to=2021-12-31">was downloaded 561,743,096 times in 2021</a>. If we assume that each of these downloads shrunk from 81,166 bytes to 77,147 bytes, the registry would have saved more than 2 terabytes in bandwidth for React alone.</p></blockquote><p>On May 29, I finally submitted my RFC. I was nervous!</p><h2 id="2022-06-01-they-discussed-it">2022-06-01: they discussed it</h2><p>A few days later, the npm CLI people had <a href="https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/596">a meeting where they discussed a bunch of stuff, including my RFC</a>. I wasn’t able to attend but watched the recording. Overall, they felt it was worth evaluating further but were cautious. From their notes:</p><blockquote><p>Overall sentiment is that the compression improvement is welcome but it looks like it would take a proof of concept and challenge some of the edge cases to see if there are any unintended consequences, etc</p></blockquote><p>I built a <a href="https://evanhahn.github.io/npm-repack-with-zopfli-proof-of-concept/">little proof of concept web app</a> that used a WebAssembly port of Zopfli to recompress npm packages and <a href="https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/595#issuecomment-1145168973">posted about it on the RFC</a>.</p><p>I attended the next meeting a couple of weeks later.</p><h2 id="2022-06-15-the-meeting">2022-06-15: the meeting</h2><p>I attended a call on June 15.</p><p>I did the bad thing where I wasn’t really listening until it was my turn because I was thinking about what I was going to say. When it was finally my turn, I stammered.</p><p>Watching it back, I cringe a bit. I was wordy, unclear, and unconvincing. But I think I did an <em>okay</em> job making my point: npm packages could become ~5% smaller if we could figure out how to run Zopfli at publish time.</p><p>You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/l8ob4j_KOR4?t=853">watch my mumbling in the recording</a>, as well as the npm maintainers’ feedback.</p><p><em>“Who benefits from this?”</em> was probably the biggest question. It was discussed that the npm registry folks, paying storage costs, might care about this. But “literally no one’s noticed” some other recent performance improvements, so they wanted to see more data. Was this just something I thought was neat (a “performance romantic”, as one person called it), or did this solve a real problem for users?</p><p>There were also concerns about including WebAssembly, the performance implications at install time, and Zopfli licensing issues.</p><p>I was tasked with some investigation on the topics above, and I got digging.</p><h2 id="2022-07-31-giving-up">2022-07-31: giving up</h2><p>After a bunch of thinking and feedback, what once seemed like an obviously great idea now seemed…well, less great.</p><p>On July 31, after doing a bunch of research, I posted <a href="https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/595#issuecomment-1200480148">a comment on the RFC</a>.</p><p>I wrote up some pros and cons. The pros:</p><ul><li>The top 250 npm packages would shrink by about 4.5% with this change.</li><li>This compression would be backwards compatible, and would require no changes from anyone else.</li></ul><p>But the cons were substantial:</p><ul><li>Integrating Zopfli into the npm CLI would be difficult.</li><li>Publishing would be slower—in some cases, <em>much</em> slower.</li><li>This wouldn’t retroactively apply to existing packages.</li></ul><p>After this discussion and thinking about the tradeoffs, I felt that it was not worth it, and I closed my RFC.</p><p>And that was that!</p><h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h2><p>I learned a lot during this process.</p><p>It was a bit nerve-wracking, but I learned how to make proposals like this. I’d written internal proposals at work, but I’d never made a semi-official RFC like this before.</p><p>I also think I did a pretty bad job in my verbal communication during the meeting. Perhaps it was because I was nervous. I could have done a better job communicating about the tradeoffs—good and bad—of the proposal. And I could have been less wordy!</p><p>I also learned that things that seem like obvious wins aren’t always obvious wins, either because the motivation isn’t there or because there are trade-offs I minimized.</p><p>Overall, even though my proposal was denied, I’m glad I did this.

<p><em>Pieter-Tjerk de Boer, PA3FWM <a href="mailto:web@pa3fwm.nl">web@pa3fwm.nl</a></em></p><p>
(This is an adapted version of an article I wrote for the Dutch
amateur radio magazine <em>Electron</em>, November 2021.)
</p><p>

<img src="https://www.pa3fwm.nl/technotes/tn28fig1.jpg" alt="Oliver Heaviside">

An antenna cable is not just a piece of wire.
Technically, it's called a "transmission line",
with special properties such as its characteristic impedance.
But transmission lines are quite a bit older than radio technology: they date back to the
second half of the 19th century, in the form of (mostly submarine) telegraph cables.
In this article we look at the principles and properties of transmission lines,
with special emphasis on Oliver Heaviside's contribution to our knowledge of them.

</p><h2>Oliver Heaviside</h2><p>

After secondary school, Oliver Heaviside (1850-1925) started working at the company
which operated the submarine telegraph cable between Newcastle (UK) and Denmark.
At first he worked as a telegraph operator, but soon he also got involved with the
(electro)technical side of the telegraph systems.
One of the things he noticed, was that when water leaked into a submarine cable and
progressively short-circuited it, the signals did not just become weaker (as expected),
but also clearer, less distorted.

</p><p>
In those days, electrical engineering was still in its infancy.
Thanks to the work of physicists like Volta, Ampère, Ørsted and Faraday, there was a decent
understanding of generating electrical currents and moving compass needles using an electromagnet.
Together, that is enough for building a telegraph, at least in principle.
But if one uses as very long cable, and tries to send dots and dashes at a high rate,
it turned out to not work so well.
There was little theoretical understanding of this,
particularly among the more practically minded people who cobbled together telegraph systems.

</p><p>
Heaviside studied physics by himself, and stumbled on the books by James Clerk Maxwell.
Maxwell's ideas about electromagnetism were, at that time, rather speculative and not widely accepted,
but Heaviside got enthousiastic, studied them, and succesfully applied this theory to telegraph lines.

</p><p>
Thus, Heaviside, who never had studied at a university, rose from being a humble telegraph operator
to a respected physicist.
After quitting his job at the telegraph company at the age of 24, he never had another job.
The rest of his life he lived in relative poverty while working on the theory.
He became one of the so-called Maxwellians: a group of physicists who enhanced Maxwell's
theory after his untimely death (in 1879 at the age of 48) and popularised it.
One of Heaviside's achievements is that he converted Maxwell's twenty mathematical formulas
into a more accessible set of just four, which nowadays are taught at all universities
as "Maxwell's equations".
If you want to learn more about this remarkable person, I recommend his biography [1].

</p><h2>Thomson's model</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.pa3fwm.nl/technotes/tn28fig2.png" alt="Thomson's model">

William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) 
attempted to describe what happens in a long telegraph cable.
His model is sketched in the figure.
He mentally chopped the cable into short pieces, each of which has some resistance and some capacitance.
Next, he calculated what happens if at the left end one suddenly applies a voltage of say 1 volt.
The graphs show the result, for a 4 km long cable having 0.1 ohm of resistance per meter,
and 10 pF of capacitance per meter.
The cable has been divided into 4 pieces of 1 km each, so each having 100 ohm and 10 nF.
We see that the voltage on the first capacitor gradually increases to 1 volt: that's logical,
as the capacitor gets charged via the first resistor.
The voltage on the second capacitor also gradually increases to 1 volt, but slower:
that makes sense, as it is charged from the first capacitor.
And so on.
At the right end of the cable, the voltage increases only very gradually,
and this slow increases puts a limit on how quickly Morse code signs can be sent.

</p><p>
However, Thomson's model is wrong.


</p><h2>Heaviside's model</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.pa3fwm.nl/technotes/tn28fig3.png" alt="Heaviside's model">

Heaviside realised that the inductance of the cable is also important.
See the next figure: here we have replaced Thomson's resistors by inductors, of 1 µH per meter of cable length.

</p><p>
First have a look at the first set of graphs, marked as "4 sections".
We see that the voltage on the first capacitor reaches the full 1 volt much earlier
than in Thomson's model, and even overshoots.
This is because once there is current flowing in an inductor, this current doesn't
just stop when the voltage across the coil becomes lower.
This faster increase of the voltage, and the fact that the current doesn't just stop,
also causes the second capacitor to be charged earlier and faster than in Thomson's model,
and so on.

</p><p>
Of course, modelling a 4 km long cable in just 4 pieces is not very realistic.
For a better model, we could e.g. model it using 10 times as many pieces,
each 10 times shorter (i.e., 40 pieces of 100 m each),
each with 10 times less capacitance and inductance.
The result is shown in the second set of graphs.
The third set of graphs is for a yet 10 times finer modelling of the cable.
The graphs now show the voltage at every 10th and every 100th capacitor, respectively;
i.e., still at distances of 1, 2, 3 and 4 km from the start of the cable,
like in the first set of graphs.
We see that with the more refined model, the voltages increase faster and the overshoot takes less long.

</p><p>
The schematic with all those coils and capacitors resembles a low-pass filter,
and indeed, we see that the voltages increase only gradually,
hinting at the absence of high frequencies.
When one partitions the model in ever smaller pieces, the inductances and capacitances
become smaller and the filter's cut-off frequency becomes higher.
If one mathematically takes the limit, eventually modelling the cable as consisting
of infinitely many pieces, each having infinitely little inductance and capacitance,
one gets an ever more accurate model.
While doing so, the low-pass effect disappears, and the voltage jump from 0 to 1 volt
is transmitted without distortion.



</p><h2>Impedance</h2><p>

Heaviside's model also helps us to understand what the "impedance" of a cable is.
At the left, suddenly a voltage of 1 volt is applied to the cable.
The capacitors are as yet uncharged, so there's 1 volt across the first inductor,
causing a gradually increasing current to flow.
How large will that current become?
That depends on the inductance: the more inductance, the slower the current increases.
And it also depends on the capacitance: the more capacitance, the more charge needs to be supplied
to charge it to 1 volt.
When the capacitor has been charged to 1 volt (ignoring the overshoot),
there will be 0 volts across the inductor, so the current through it will no longer change.
The current doesn't become 0, but remains constant, flows into the second inductor,
charges the second capacitor, and so on.

</p><p>
And what happens when also the last capacitor has been charged?
As noted above, the current through those inductors cannot just stop.
If we "terminate" the cable in a resistor, as shown in the figure, then the
current will flow through the resistor and cause a voltage drop across it.
If the resistor has exactly the right value, then that voltage drop is exactly 1 volt.
Then we reach a stable state: all capacitors are charged to 1 volt, across the coils
there's no voltage, and a constant current flows from the source through the cable
and the termination resistor.

</p><p>
If the termination resistor is too large, the voltage drop across it will be more than 1 volt,
so the last capacitor will be charged to more than 1 volt.
Via the last inductor a part of that charge will then flow back from the last to the
second-to-last capacitor, from there to the third-last capacitor, and so on:
we get a <i>reflected</i> wave.
Something similar happens if the termination resistor is too small.

</p><p>
The value of the termination resistor which does <i>not</i> cause a reflection,
is called the impedance of the cable.
It turns out that this equals <math><msqrt><mi><i>L/C</i></mi></msqrt></math>,
where <i>L</i> and <i>C</i> are the inductance and capacitance per meter of cable length.
Note that this formula matches what we already observed earlier: more <i>L</i> means less current
and thus higher termination resistor needed to still drop 1 volt;
similarly, more <i>C</i> means more current and thus lower termination resistor.


</p><h2>Speed</h2><p>

In the previous figure, we effectively saw a <i>wave</i> move from left to right through the cable;
the farther from the source, the later the voltage change arrives.
How fast does this wave move?
That also depends on the values of <i>L</i> and <i>C</i>.
The larger the inductance <i>L</i>, the slower the current increases (at given voltage),
so the longer it takes to charge the next capacitor.
And the larger <i>C</i>, the longer it takes (at given current) to charge the capacitance.
Heaviside showed that the speed equals </p><mathml>1/<msqrt><mi><i>LC</i></mi></msqrt>.

<p>
Does this mean that we can make a cable with any desired speed,
simply by choosing <i>L</i> and <i>C</i> appropriately?
Perhaps even faster than light? (Einstein already starts turning over in his grave.)
No: it turns out that we have only limited freedom in choosing <i>L</i> and <i>C</i>.
Changing the shape and size of the cable affects both <i>L</i> and <i>C</i>, and always
such that the speed of light is never exceeded.

</p><p>
<img src="https://www.pa3fwm.nl/technotes/tn28fig4.png" alt="[properties of coaxial cable]">
As an example, consider a coaxial cable.
If one makes the center conductor thinner, the capacitance between center conductor and
shield decreases, so by the formula one would expect the speed to increase.
Unfortunately, at the same time the inductance increases!
That's (among others) because making the center conductor thinner causes the currents
inside that center conductor to be closer together, and thus sense more of each other's
magnetic field (which, after all, is what causes (self)-inductance).

<o>
The figure shows, for a coaxial cable with air as isolation,
the theorectical dependence of the capacitance and inductance (both per meter) on the ratio of the
diameters of the center conductor and the shield.
Furthermore, the resulting impedance and wave velocity are indicated.
The solid lines are based on the assumption that the current spreads itself equally
over the entire cross-section of the center conductor.
We see that in this case the velocity increases when the center conductor is made thinner,
but does not exceed the speed of light (300 × 10<sup>6</sup> m/s).
At higher frequencies the skin-effect kicks in, forcing the current to only flow on the outside
of the center conductor.
That case is indicated with dotted lines, and the speed exactly equals the speed of light,
regardless of the diameters.

</o></p><p>
If we fill the cable with e.g. some plastic material, the capacitance increases while the
inductance remains the same. Then the speed decreases; this is generally described
as the "velocity factor" being less than 1.

</p><h2>Loss and distortion</h2>
<img src="https://www.pa3fwm.nl/technotes/tn28fig5.png" alt="[Heaviside's model with loss]">

So far, we haven't included loss in the model, but a real cable does have loss due to resistances,
and Heaviside included this in his model, as sketched at the right.
There are two kinds of loss.
The first one is the resistance of the copper wire itself; to model this,
Heaviside included a resistance of <i>R</i> ohms per meter in series with each inductance.
The second one is the leakage of the capacitor's isolation, modelled as a parallel resistance 1/<i>G</i>.
(We write this as 1/<i>G</i> because this resistance is inversely proportional to the length;
the shorter the cable section, the less leakage, so the larger the leakage resistance.
Thus <i>G</i> itself, being the inverse of the resistance, is again directly proportional
to the length; it is expressed in Ω<sup>-1</sup> per meter, also called Siemens per meter.)

<p>
Heaviside showed that losses do not just attenuate the signal, but also cause distortion.
In fact we already saw this in Thomson's model in the first figure:
the sudden increase of the voltage at the input of the cable, is distorted to something
that only rises slowsly, as it travels down the cable.

</p><p>
However, Heaviside also found out that this distortion disappears if the following
condition is satisfied: <i>L</i>/<i>R</i> = <i>C</i>/<i>G</i>.
If there is no loss, then <i>R</i> and <i>G</i> are both 0, so the condition is satisfied.
But a realistic cable usually has <i>L</i>/<i>R</i>  much smaller than <i>C</i>/<i>G</i>,
because <i>G</i>, the leakage of the isolation, is almost zero (good isolation material),
and particularly in submarine cables, the capacitance is rather high.
In principle, we can improve such a cable in four ways to satisfy the condition:
</p><ul>
<li> decrease <i>R</i>: use thicker copper wire, that's expensive.
</li><li> decrease <i>C</i>, i.e., increase the distance between the wires: that may be feasible
on telegraph poles on land, but making a coaxial submarine cable thicker is hard (expensive).
</li><li> increase <i>G</i>, so use a not-so-good isolation material: this is what happens when
water seeps into a sea-cable (recall that Heaviside as a telegraph operator had already noticed that
then the distortion is reduced), but the obvious disadvantage is that the signals
become weaker.
</li><li> what remains: increase <i>L</i>.
</li></ul>

<img src="https://www.pa3fwm.nl/technotes/tn28fig6.jpg" alt="[a Pupin coil]">
Indeed, special cables have been manufactured in which the center conductor has extra
inductance, by covering it in a suitable magnetic material.
But the most commonly used way to increase <i>L</i>, is by connecting a coil in series
every couple of kilometers.
Heaviside invented this idea, but William Preece, the British telegraph service's 
engineer-in-chief didn't believe it, and in fact thought that one should avoid inductance.
As a consequence, the technique initially was not tried in England (and this was not the
only conflict between Heaviside and Preece [1]).
But Michael Pupin patented the idea a few years later in America.
It turned out to work very well and has been used for decades in the telephone industry,
until it became possible to amplify signals electronically.
And radio amateurs have, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s, used such Pupin coils
for making audio filters.
The picture shows a typical Pupin coil. It had two windings, with red and green wires,
for both wires of the telephone line. Separately the windings usually were 22 mH,
in series 88 mH.

<p>
Should we now also insert coils into our antenna cables to prevent distortion of our
radio signals?
No: firstly the distortion is negligible for relatively narrow-band signals;
and secondly, such coils would work as a low-pass filter, so our (high) frequencies
wouldn't get through anymore.

<p><span><span><span><span>Elbilernes salgskurve er de seneste år gået stejlt opad, og mere end hver anden solgte nye bil er nu en elbil. Det mærker man nu også ude i landets synshaller, hvor elbiler ikke længere er et særsyn. Lige Godt 28.000 elbiler var i de første 11 måneder af 2024 til periodisk syn. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Det er dog langtfra alle elbiler, der klarer turen på liften lige godt. Især én model falder igennem: Tesla Model 3. Den populære elbil, som der kører i alt 35.000 af på de danske veje, blev lanceret i 2019, og dermed har den første store årgang været til sit første periodiske bilsyn i det forgangne år.</span></span></span></span></p>





<h2><span><span><span><span>Rasende høj dumpeprocent</span></span></span></span></h2>

<p><span><span><span>Af de 4.668 Tesla Model 3 årgang 2020, som mellem 1. januar og 21. november sidste år var til syn, dumpede de 1.051. Det svarer til 23 procent. Til sammenligning dumpede ’kun’ 9 procent af de øvrige elbiler, der var til syn i 2024, viser tal fra Færdselsstyrelsen, som FDM Test &amp; Bilsyn har analyseret. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>– Det er en rasende høj dumpeprocent for Tesla Model 3, som Færdselsstyrelsens synsdata afslører, men det er desværre ikke noget, som overrasker os. Tallene indikerer, at kvaliteten og holdbarheden af Tesla Model 3, i hvert fald de første årgange, ikke er på niveau med andre bilmærker. Det er noget, vi også oplever, og som vi holder øje med, siger områdechef i FDMs tekniske rådgivning Lone Otto. </span></span></span></p>

<h2>Tesla har mere end hver 3. af alle fejl</h2>

<p><span><span><span>I</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;alt blev der fundet 1.392 fejl på de Tesla Model 3 årgang 2020, svarende til 0,3 fejl pr. synet model. Dermed blev der fundet tre gange så mange fejl i forhold til de øvrige elbiler, som blev synet sidste år. </span></span></span></p>



<p><span><span><span><span>Billedet fra de danske synshaller af Tesla Model 3 stemmer overens med synstal fra Tyskland. Også her faldt bilmodellen igennem i den årlige synsrapport fra tyske TÜV, der bl.a. syner biler. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Det er særligt fejlgrupperne „bremseudstyr“, „lygteudstyr“, „aksler, hjul og dæk“ samt „styretøj“, som bilerne dumper på. Noget man i FDMs tekniske rådgivning kan nikke genkendende til. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>– Elbiler bremser på en anden måde, og derfor er problemer med bremserne velkendt. Men det er kritisk, at problemer med hjulophæng og ratslør er så udtalt på en bil, der ikke er ældre end Tesla Model 3. Det ser vi ikke på andre biler. Det samme gælder Teslas overrepræsentation af fejl på lygter, som ofte enten er løse, eller som blænder, siger Lone Otto</span></span></span></p>

<h2><span><span><span>62.000 elbiler skal til syn i år</span></span></span></h2>

<p><span><span><span>Det kommende år skal 62.000 elbiler til syn herhjemme – de 45.000 for første gang. Heriblandt Tesla Model 3 årgang 2021 og ikke mindst den første årgang af Tesla Model Y, der er den mest solgte elbil i Danmark. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>– Vi har ingen grund til at tro, at yngre årgange af Tesla Model 3 vil adskille sig væsentligt fra årgang 2020, når det gælder fejl og dermed også dumpeprocent. Mere spændende bliver det at se, hvordan Tesla Model Y vil klare sig, siger Lone Otto og tilføjer:</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>– Tesla har fire års garanti på sine biler. Det passer med deres første syn. Et godt råd er derfor at få bilen gennemgået af en uvildig, inden man når skæringsdatoen. I det hele taget anbefaler vi, at man løbende servicerer sin bil og får gennemgået bilens bremser og generelle stand. Gerne en gang om året. Det gælder uanset bilmærke, eller om bilen overhovedet har et fast serviceinterval.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Opdateret 24. januar:</p>

<p><span><span>FDM har bedt Tesla om en kommentar til dels synstallene for deres Model 3 dels kritikken af bilens kvalitet. Det er ikke lykkedes at få. I en mail til FDM gør Tesla dog opmærksom på, at Tesla Model 3 fik et større facelift i 2021, og at modellen i 2023 kom i en ny og markant forbedret udgave. </span></span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <article>
    <p>It happened on the afternoon of May 4th. A message from a colleague—who has since become a good friend—popped up on my screen, urging me to check my emails. When I opened my inbox, there it was: an email from the COO. The email announced an impending company-wide layoff and mentioned that, within a few minutes, I’d receive another email letting me know whether I was impacted. A short while later, the second email arrived. I was among those affected—along with most of my team.</p>

<p>The situation felt surreal. One by one, my colleagues posted in our team chat, confirming they’d been impacted too. Before our accounts were locked, we quickly jumped on a call. We had just 30 minutes to have one final conversation as a team, to say our goodbyes. It was a bittersweet moment, sharing those last words with people I’d worked so closely with.</p>

<p>It was difficult to process what was happening. Just ten months earlier, the company had gone through another round of layoffs. And at the beginning of the year, during the company’s kick-off event, the president assured us there wouldn’t be any more layoffs. They even said the company was performing well financially. So, why was this happening?</p>

<h2 id="signs-of-a-layoff">Signs of a Layoff</h2>

<p>Looking back, my colleagues and I were not entirely surprised by the layoff. There were several warning signs that hinted something was coming. I want to share these signs so you can be better prepared if you ever face a similar situation.</p>

<h3 id="1-cancellation-of-team-events">1. Cancellation of Team Events</h3>
<p>One of the earliest indicators was the sudden cancellation of team events. When I heard from other teams that their off-site events were canceled without any clear explanation, it immediately raised red flags. These cancellations often signal that the company is going to announce something about the team structure and doesn’t want you to be with your team in the same place. This is because one of your teammates—or you—might be impacted, and you’d need to cancel flights, hotels, etc. To avoid dealing with these logistical issues, the company preemptively cancels the event.</p>

<h3 id="2-unexpected-notifications-about-packages">2. Unexpected Notifications About Packages</h3>
<p>Some employees at the company received notifications about packages scheduled to arrive at their homes. This happens because services like DHL notify you through their app when a package is on the way. If your company requires you to return your work equipment, like a laptop, after being laid off, they often arrange for these shipping boxes to be delivered in advance. If you unexpectedly see a notification about a package from your company’s IT provider, it’s a strong sign that a layoff is imminent—and you may be impacted.</p>

<h3 id="3-lack-of-vision-from-leadership">3. Lack of Vision from Leadership</h3>
<p>The absence of a clear vision from leadership is one of the most common signs of an impending layoff. During off-site or kick-off events, you might notice that leaders seem unsure of the company’s direction. When this lack of clarity is followed by team restructuring, and then another restructuring just a few months later, it becomes evident that the leadership is struggling to find focus. Ultimately, this cycle often ends with a layoff, accompanied by yet another round of restructuring for those who remain.</p>

<h3 id="4-sudden-vague-meetings">4. Sudden, Vague Meetings</h3>
<p>Another sign is the appearance of unexpected, vague meetings on your calendar. These meetings are marked as “important” with no clear agenda, and attendance is mandatory. If this happens, it’s often a precursor to a layoff announcement. Public companies, in particular, may choose to send layoff notices via email to align the timing with when they notify investors.</p>

<h3 id="5-timing-around-quarterly-results">5. Timing Around Quarterly Results</h3>

<p>If your company is publicly traded, layoffs are frequently announced in conjunction with quarterly earnings reports. This can be especially stressful because, leading up to every financial results announcement, employees may anxiously wait to see if layoffs will accompany the news. If no layoffs are announced, you know you’re safe—for at least one more quarter.</p>

<h2 id="youre-just-a-row-in-an-excel-table">You’re Just a Row in an Excel Table</h2>

<p>When I looked back on my time at the company and all the things I had accomplished, I was surprised to be impacted by the layoffs. It wasn’t because I thought I was better than others—it was because I believed I was doing more than what was expected of me. However, during a layoff, it seems that who you are and what you do doesn’t matter. In most cases, the decision is made by people who don’t even know you. This realization made me question the concept of work, which is part of the reason I’m writing this blog post.</p>

<p>I was hired as a Backend Developer. When I joined my team, I noticed a project that needed a developer to implement the client-side feature in React Native. Although I had no prior experience with React Native, I had worked with React before, so I volunteered for the task. I shipped the feature without any issues, received positive feedback from my team and lead, and eventually, my title was changed to Developer, making me a full-stack developer.</p>

<p>In some instances, I worked on projects independently, always aligning with my team and ensuring my work was reviewed. I would implement the backend first and then move on to the client-side. This was my expected role, and in performance reviews, I was consistently rated as a high performer. Yet, I was always doing more than what was expected of me.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I worked on small features I thought would enhance the app. These features might not have been used by many, but they provided significant value to heavy users. Occasionally, I shipped these under the radar. I created dashboards to measure the impact of my team’s work, helping us focus on features that would bring the most value to users. I also built proof-of-concept features based on user requests to show leadership how easily they could be implemented, advocating for their prioritization. Additionally, I participated in hackdays, creating projects to showcase innovative ideas.</p>

<p>On several occasions, I was selected for special projects outside my team. These projects often came directly from the CEO, and I was chosen because I constantly wanted to do more for the company and our users. For some of these projects, I worked more than eight hours a day, including weekends. A few of these initiatives were mentioned in financial reports, praised by the CEO during all-hands meetings, or retweeted multiple times by the CEO on Twitter.</p>

<p>Over time, I gained the attention of senior management in my business unit, which consisted of about 400 people. I began directly interacting with the VP of Product and the VP of Engineering, both of whom were four or five levels above me. Occasionally, the VP of Product would message me directly to ask if a feature was feasible to implement. Later, the VP of Engineering started scheduling regular one-on-one meetings with me, which was highly uncommon. During these calls, he told me multiple times that if I continued working at this level, I could quickly climb the ladder to become a Staff Developer. He wasn’t the only one saying this to me.</p>

<p>Beyond my immediate role, I also sought ways to contribute to the broader company. Whenever a new tool was introduced, I would explore it, write detailed articles about my findings, and share them to help other teams use the tool more effectively.</p>

<p>I referred many friends and former colleagues to the company because I believed in its mission. If I recall correctly, I referred over ten people, four of whom received offers, and three were ultimately hired. I also encouraged many others to consider joining the company.</p>

<p>I even initiated discussions about translating our website into Turkish to support the many customers we had in Turkey. A few weeks before the layoff announcement, I was helping a team working on this project find a Turkish-speaking content designer because they noticed my willingness to assist.</p>

<p>Additionally, I tried to convince friends who were CTOs at major e-commerce companies to migrate their websites to our platform. Whenever I received job offers from e-commerce companies on LinkedIn, I used those opportunities to promote our platform instead. I passed along leads to the sales team and later noticed that one of those companies had indeed moved to our platform.</p>

<p>I’m not sharing all of this to brag but to highlight that, in the end, none of it mattered. On the day I announced I had been laid off, I received numerous messages from colleagues, even those I hadn’t worked with directly, telling me that I had inspired and motivated them. While those messages were heartwarming, they didn’t change the reality: to the company, I was just a row in an Excel sheet.</p>

<h2 id="the-broken-trust-of-modern-work">The Broken Trust of Modern Work</h2>

<p>Layoffs were uncommon when I started working, and being a developer felt like an incredibly safe job. In most professions, the unspoken rule was simple: if you performed well and the company was financially stable, your job was secure.</p>

<p>But today, companies are announcing layoffs alongside record-breaking financial results. You work hard, focus on impactful projects, and receive praise from your lead—only to find yourself let go by someone who likely doesn’t even know you exist. It feels as though the trust between companies and employees is now broken. Companies, it seems, are either unaware of this shift or unwilling to address it. And frankly, I’m not sure how they could fix it.</p>

<p>What’s particularly strange is that the layoffs predominantly affect individual contributors—the people who have little say in deciding the company’s direction. These are the team members closest to the users, the ones who spend hours planning how to improve the product. But after those plans are made, leadership often swoops in and redirects efforts toward entirely different goals. You trust their judgment, work on their priorities, and deliver on time. Then, when the arbitrary goals they set aren’t met, the company decides to cut staff. Those who made the poor decisions remain, and some are even promoted, while the people carrying out the work are let go. It feels surreal—like <a rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u48vYSLvKNQ">an episode from Silicon Valley</a>—but this is how big companies operate.</p>

<p>I’m not alone in feeling this way. Many friends and ex-colleagues who’ve been laid off in recent years share similar experiences. They’ve lost trust in their employers. They believe their efforts won’t matter in the long run and anticipate being part of the next layoff cycle. As a result, they only do what’s strictly required to avoid a performance improvement plan. No one goes above and beyond anymore; no one takes initiative to improve things. Why? Because it doesn’t matter. They’ve seen firsthand that it changes nothing.</p>

<p>For those like me who’ve experienced layoffs, work has become just that—work. You do what’s assigned, and if your company squanders your potential or forces you to waste time on unnecessary projects, you simply stop caring. You collect your paycheck at the end of the month, and that’s it. This is the new modern work: no more striving to be 40% better every year.</p>

<h2 id="the-myth-of-job-security-in-germany">The Myth of Job Security in Germany</h2>

<p>Since I was working for a German entity of a company, I want to address a common myth about job security in Germany. Many people believe that it’s nearly impossible to be fired in Germany. While this is partially true for individuals who have completed their probation period, it doesn’t hold up in the context of layoffs. If a company decides to lay off, for instance, 40 employees, German law doesn’t prevent this. Instead, the law enforces a social scoring system to determine who is affected, prioritizing the protection of the most vulnerable employees, such as those with children. In this sense, when it comes to layoffs, the difference between Germany and the US is minimal.</p>

<h2 id="suggestions-for-those-who-havent-been-laid-off-yet">Suggestions for Those Who Haven’t Been Laid Off (Yet)</h2>

<p>When I talk to friends who were laid off in recent years, we often reflect on what we could have done differently. Here are some of the lessons we’ve learned:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Stick to your contract hours.</strong> If your contract says 40 hours, work 40 hours—no more, no less. Protect your personal time and well-being.</li>
  <li><strong>Avoid going above and beyond with initiatives.</strong> Many companies encourage impactful work to earn promotions, but instead of chasing internal advancements, focus on switching companies to achieve your next career step.</li>
  <li><strong>Always keep interviewing.</strong> One of the biggest mistakes I’ve seen is stopping interviews after starting a new job, trusting in the company. Instead, continuously explore opportunities so that if a layoff happens, you already have other options lined up.</li>
  <li><strong>Leverage external offers for salary growth.</strong> Companies often resist giving substantial raises to existing employees but pay top dollar for new hires. Regularly interview elsewhere, and if you get an offer with a 20% or higher salary increase, consider taking it. Many people have seen their compensation triple or quadruple this way in just a few years.</li>
  <li><strong>Don’t overthink your résumé.</strong> Worrying about short experiences on your CV isn’t worth it. You can always tailor your résumé—leave out brief roles, or consolidate short-term jobs as freelance experience. Ultimately, your résumé is just a starting point; your skills will be assessed during the interview process.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>You’ve probably noticed that I didn’t mention the name of the company I was laid off from. That’s because I believe it’s irrelevant. Everything I’ve shared reflects the current state of the tech industry. It might differ at very small companies, but once you work at a company with more than 100 employees, you’ll likely encounter many of the same patterns I’ve described.</p>

<p>I’ve wanted to write about this topic for a long time, but it’s been difficult to find the energy. The subject itself is a deep disappointment for me, and every time I reflect on layoffs, it makes me profoundly sad. It’s a stark reminder of how companies treat workers as disposable. Before you join, they go to great lengths to make you feel valued and excited to accept their offer. You meet multiple people, and some even offer signing bonuses. But when layoffs come, you’re reduced to a name on a list. During the exit interview, a random person from the company reads a prepared script and can’t answer your questions. The HR team that once worked to make you feel valued doesn’t even conduct an actual conversation with you. That random person becomes the last connection you have to a company you spent years at.</p>

<p>The layoff fundamentally changed how I perceive work now. I don’t think that I’ll be the same person again.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.hedy.org/">https://www.hedy.org/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42837636">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main_page_content">
        
        <div>
                    <h2>Textual programming made easy!</h2>
                    
                    <p>Many schools and teachers around the world want to teach their students programming. Initially this is often done with playful tools, ranging from the Beebot robot to
Scratch Junior or Scratch. After using such tools, kids often want to move to more powerful, textual programming languages, like Python.</p>
<p>Python however is hard, because it is only available in English, and requires learners to learn complex programming concepts and syntax at once.
Hedy is the easy way to get started with textual programming languages! Hedy is free to use, open source, and unlike any other textual programming language in three ways.</p>
<ol>
<li>Hedy is multi-lingual, you can use Hedy in your own language</li>
<li>Hedy is gradual, so you can learn one concept and its syntax a time</li>
<li>Hedy is built for the classroom, allowing teachers to fully customize their student's experience</li>
</ol>

                </div>
        
        <div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Multi-lingual programming</h3>
                        <p>While almost all textual programming language have keywords in English, such as <code>for</code> or <code>repeat</code>, Hedy can be used in any language! We currently support 47 different languages, including Dutch, Spanish, Arabic, Turkish, Chinese and Hindi. If your language is not available you can always start a new translation.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p><img src="https://d1xliaqnpftsm2.cloudfront.net/static-bdbbcc20a24ec0b311573119d46d08f324f0eb99/images/hedy-multilang.png">
                </p></div>
        
        <div>
                    <p><img src="https://d1xliaqnpftsm2.cloudfront.net/static-bdbbcc20a24ec0b311573119d46d08f324f0eb99/images/hedy-grows.png"></p><div>
                        <h3>Step by step learning</h3>
                        <p>Learning a programming language can be overwhelming, since learners have to learn concepts (for example if-else or loops) and syntax (like quotation marks or round brackets) at the same time. In Hedy, concepts are first introduced with little syntax and then refined. A scientifically proven way to learn!</p>

                    </div>
                </div>
        
        <div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Built for the classroom</h3>
                        <p>Hedy is suitable for kids aged 10 and up and designed for classroom use.
Teachers can use our free, built-in lesson plans, but can also author their own lessons and load these into the Hedy user interface.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p><img src="https://d1xliaqnpftsm2.cloudfront.net/static-bdbbcc20a24ec0b311573119d46d08f324f0eb99/images/hedy-classroom.png">
                </p></div>
        
        <div>
                    <h2>Programming in context</h2>
                    
                    <p>Hedy shows programming in the broadest way possible, and can be used in variety of exciting ways. Hedy allows for the creation of digital and interactive stories, colorful drawings that can be shown on the screen but also drawn with a pen plotter or embroidered on a shirt, and can be used to create games or apps with buttons and keyboard actions.</p>

                </div>
        
        <div>
                    
                    <div>
                        <h3>Is Hedy free?</h3>
                        <p>Yes! Hedy is 'Open source', which means that everyone can help us make Hedy better.
You can find our code on <a href="https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy" target="_blank">Github</a>.
If you like Hedy and want to contribute, we accept (and are very grateful for) <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/hedyorg" target="_blank">donations</a>!</p>

                    </div>
                    
                    <div>
                        <h3>Do I need to install anything?</h3>
                        <p>No. Hedy works in the browser, which is the program you are using to look at this page. Probably Chrome or Edge or Firefox. Hedy also works on phones and tablets.</p>

                    </div>
                    
                    <div>
                        <h3>Do I need programming experience to teach with Hedy?</h3>
                        <p>No, that is not needed. All concepts are explained in the slides and in the interface for learners.
If you create a free teacher's account, you also get access to the teacher's manual with information on how to teach
and frequently made mistakes.</p>

                    </div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Cheap, no-nonsense email</h2><p>Let's get straight to the point:</p><ul><li>We host your email address.</li><li>We're IMAP and POP3 compatible, so we work with most mail apps.</li><ul><li>Or you can use our webmail, powered by <a href="https://roundcube.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roundcube</a>.</li></ul><li>No arbitrary limits. Have as many users and store as much mail as you want.</li><li>Bring as many of your own domains as you want, or use one of ours. No extra charges.</li><li>It's cheap. Really, really cheap.</li></ul><h2>How cheap?</h2><p>Let's say you only need one email address, and have 3 GB of data to store. For one year of use, this will cost:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://protonmail.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Protonmail</a></td><td>$48.00</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://fastmail.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fastmail</a></td><td>$60.00</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://workspace.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Workspace</a></td><td>$72.00</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://zoho.com/mail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zoho</a></td><td>$12.00</td></tr><tr><td><a href="https://hushmail.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hushmail</a></td><td>$49.98</td></tr><tr><td>Purelymail</td><td>$10.00</td></tr></tbody></table><p>For most use cases, Purelymail is the cheapest option available. <b>Especially</b> if you need more than one user. All of the plans above charge per user, but we don't. Check out our <a href="https://purelymail.com/pricing">pricing page</a> for more information. (For an in-depth explanation of this particular comparison, <a href="https://purelymail.com/pricingcomparisonindepth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see here.</a>)</p><h2>What's the catch?</h2><p>What you get here is  <i>purely</i> mail. </p><p>We're not trying to bamboozle you with glossy images, or sell you a lofty ideal. If we have a gimmick, it's that we offer a known service at a low price. What you do with it is up to you.</p><h3>An honest list of drawbacks</h3><p>Based on our experience, here are our weak points:</p><ul><li>Occasionally, obscure email servers will block emails sent through us. Usually this can be resolved within a day or two.</li><li>We don't have a 24/7 support staff, although we do try to get back to any inquiries within a day.</li><li>Some features other providers have, such as calendar syncing, are not yet implemented.</li><li>We're not for sending any type of unsolicited or marketing emails (you should use a dedicated marketing platform anyway).</li><li>Our UI can be a little unpolished and unglamorous, if that bothers you.</li></ul><h3>Also, we're in beta</h3><p>That means there might be a few hiccups along the way. If you run across any problems you can always <a href="https://purelymail.com/support">let us know,</a> and we'll do our best to fix them.</p><p>If you're interested in Purelymail but want to wait until we're out of beta, check out <a href="https://purelymail.com/betamailinglist">our mailing list.</a></p><h2>Is this for me?</h2><b>Do you want email?</b><p>Then yes, probably.</p><b>What about security and reliability?</b><p><a href="https://purelymail.com/docs/security">We do take security seriously.</a></p><p>As for reliability, we're in beta, but our architecture has proven itself robust so far, our infrastructure runs on the highly reliable AWS cloud, and even if we do have an outage the email protocols are pretty forgiving. (See our <a href="https://news.purelymail.com/status.html">status page</a> for our historical issues- there aren't that many.)</p><b>Do you sell user data or ads?</b><p>Absolutely not.

    <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The rapid spread of artificial intelligence has people wondering: who’s most likely to embrace AI in their daily lives? Many assume it’s the tech-savvy – those who understand how AI works – who are most eager to adopt it. </p>

<p>Surprisingly, our new research (published in the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00222429251314491">Journal of Marketing</a>) finds the opposite. People with less knowledge about AI are actually more open to using the technology. We call this difference in adoption propensity the “lower literacy-higher receptivity” link.</p>

<p>This link shows up across different groups, settings and even countries. For instance, our analysis of <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2022-01/Global-opinions-and-expectations-about-AI-2022.pdf">data from market research company Ipsos</a> spanning 27 countries reveals that people in nations with lower average AI literacy are more receptive towards AI adoption than those in nations with higher literacy. </p>

<p>Similarly, our survey of US undergraduate students finds that those with less understanding of AI are more likely to indicate using it for tasks like academic assignments. </p>

<p>The reason behind this link lies in how AI now performs tasks we once thought only humans could do. When AI creates a piece of art, writes a heartfelt response or plays a musical instrument, it can feel almost magical – like it’s crossing into human territory. </p>

<p>Of course, AI <a href="https://online.hull.ac.uk/blog/what-is-artificial-intelligence-and-how-is-it-different-from-human-intelligence">doesn’t actually possess</a> human qualities. A chatbot might generate an empathetic response, but it doesn’t feel empathy. People with more technical knowledge about AI understand this. </p>

<p>They know how algorithms (sets of mathematical rules used by computers to carry out particular tasks), training data (used to improve how an AI system works) and computational models operate. This makes the technology less mysterious.</p>

<p>On the other hand, those with less understanding may see AI as magical and awe inspiring. We suggest this sense of magic makes them more open to using AI tools.</p>

<p>Our studies show this lower literacy-higher receptivity link is strongest for using AI tools in areas people associate with human traits, like providing emotional support or counselling. When it comes to tasks that don’t evoke the same sense of human-like qualities – such as analysing test results – the pattern flips. People with higher AI literacy are more receptive to these uses because they focus on AI’s efficiency, rather than any “magical” qualities.</p>

<h2>It’s not about capability, fear or ethics</h2>

<p>Interestingly, this link between lower literacy and higher receptivity persists even though people with lower AI literacy are more likely to view AI as less capable, less ethical, and even a bit scary. Their openness to AI seems to stem from their sense of wonder about what it can do, despite these perceived drawbacks. </p>

<p>This finding offers new insights into <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0022243719851788?casa_token=TCasUPe0eDgAAAAA%3AxYiVq00BSj6fmxbhnc_wFboqbpHOPqIV11GqnXJHGJiO6ArnO1hD0cFMJMzPr2n6q2xUM9tgrNw">why people respond so differently to emerging technologies</a>. Some studies suggest <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749597818303388">consumers favour new tech</a>, a phenomenon called “algorithm appreciation”, while others show scepticism, or “algorithm aversion”. Our research points to perceptions of AI’s “magicalness” as a key factor shaping these reactions.</p>

<p>These insights pose a challenge for policymakers and educators. <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2022/03/without-universal-ai-literacy-ai-will-fail-us/">Efforts to boost AI literacy</a> might unintentionally dampen people’s enthusiasm for using AI by making it seem less magical. This creates a tricky balance between helping people understand AI and keeping them open to its adoption. </p>

<p>To make the most of AI’s potential, businesses, educators and policymakers need to strike this balance. By understanding how perceptions of “magicalness” shape people’s openness to AI, we can help develop and deploy new AI-based products and services that take the way people view AI into account, and help them understand the benefits and risks of AI.</p>

<p>And ideally, this will happen without causing a loss of the awe that inspires many people to embrace this new technology.</p>

<p dir="auto">OpenHaystack is an application that allows you to create your own accessories that are tracked by Apple's <a href="#how-does-apples-find-my-network-work">Find My network</a>. All you need is a Mac and a <a href="https://microbit.org/" rel="nofollow">BBC micro:bit</a> or any <a href="#how-to-track-other-bluetooth-devices">other Bluetooth-capable device</a>.
By using the app, you can track your accessories anywhere on earth without cellular coverage. Nearby iPhones will discover your accessories and upload their location to Apple's servers when they have a network connection.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">History</h3><a id="user-content-history" aria-label="Permalink: History" href="#history"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">OpenHaystack is the result of reverse-engineering and security analysis work of Apple's <em>Find My network</em> (or <em>offline finding</em>). We at the <a href="https://seemoo.de/" rel="nofollow">Secure Mobile Networking Lab</a> of TU Darmstadt started analyzing offline finding after its initial announcement in June 2019. We identified how Apple devices can be found by iPhones devices, even when they are offline through this work. The whole system is a clever combination of Bluetooth advertisements, public-key cryptography, and a central database of encrypted location reports. We disclosed a specification of the closed parts of offline finding and conducted a comprehensive security and privacy analysis.
We found two distinct vulnerabilities. The most severe one, which allowed a malicious application to access location data, has meanwhile been fixed by Apple (<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211849" rel="nofollow">CVE-2020-9986</a>).
For more information about the security analysis, please read <a href="#references">our paper</a>.
Since its release, we received quite a bit of <a href="https://owlink.org/press/" rel="nofollow">press and media coverage</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Disclaimer</h3><a id="user-content-disclaimer" aria-label="Permalink: Disclaimer" href="#disclaimer"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">OpenHaystack is experimental software. The code is untested and incomplete. For example, OpenHaystack accessories using our <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/Firmware">firmware</a> broadcast a fixed public key and, therefore, are trackable by other devices in proximity (this might change in a future release). OpenHaystack is not affiliated with or endorsed by Apple Inc.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How to use <em>OpenHaystack</em>?</h2><a id="user-content-how-to-use-openhaystack" aria-label="Permalink: How to use OpenHaystack?" href="#how-to-use-openhaystack"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">OpenHaystack consists of two components. First, we provide a <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/OpenHaystack">macOS application</a> that can display the last reported location of your personal Bluetooth devices. Second, the <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/Firmware">firmware image</a> enables Bluetooth devices to broadcast beacons that make them discoverable by iPhones.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">System requirements</h3><a id="user-content-system-requirements" aria-label="Permalink: System requirements" href="#system-requirements"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">OpenHaystack requires macOS 11 (Big Sur).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h3><a id="user-content-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The OpenHaystack application requires a custom plugin for Apple Mail. It is used to download location reports from Apple's servers via a private API (technical explanation: the plugin inherits Apple Mail's entitlements required to use this API).
Therefore, the installation procedure is slightly different and requires you to temporarily disable <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/gatekeeper-and-runtime-protection-sec5599b66df/1/web/1" rel="nofollow">Gatekeeper</a>.
Our plugin does not access any other private data such as emails (see <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/OpenHaystack/OpenHaystackMail">source code</a>).</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Download a precompiled binary release from our <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/releases">GitHub page</a>.<br>
<em>Alternative:</em> build the application from source via Xcode.</li>
<li>Open OpenHaystack. This will ask you to install the Mail plugin in <code>~/Library/Mail/Bundle</code>.</li>
<li>Open a terminal and run <code>sudo spctl --master-disable</code>, which will disable Gatekeeper and allow our Apple Mail plugin to run.</li>
<li>Open Apple Mail. Go to <em>Preferences</em> → <em>General</em> → <em>Manage Plug-Ins...</em> and activate the checkbox next to <em>OpenHaystackMail.mailbundle</em>.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>If the <em>Manage Plug-Ins...</em> button does not appear. Run this command in terminal <code>sudo defaults write "/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail" EnableBundles 1</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Allow access and restart Mail.</li>
<li>Open a terminal and enter <code>sudo spctl --master-enable</code>, which will enable Gatekeeper again.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h3><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Adding a new accessory.</strong>
To create a new accessory, you just need to enter a name for it and optionally select a suitable icon and a color. The app then generates a new key pair that is used to encrypt and decrypt the location reports. The private key is stored in your Mac's keychain.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Deploy to device.</strong>
Connect a <a href="#how-to-track-other-bluetooth-devices">supported device</a> via USB to your Mac and hit the <em>Deploy</em> button next to the accessory's name and choose the corresponding.
Instead of using OpenHaystack's integrated deployment, you may also copy the public key used for advertising (right click on accessory) and deploy it manually.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Display devices' locations.</strong>
It can take up to 30 minutes until you will see the first location report on the map on the right side. The map will always show all your items' most recent locations. You can click on every item to check when the last update was received.
By clicking the reload button, you can update the location reports.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How does Apple's Find My network work?</h2><a id="user-content-how-does-apples-find-my-network-work" aria-label="Permalink: How does Apple's Find My network work?" href="#how-does-apples-find-my-network-work"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We briefly explain Apple's offline finding system (aka <a href="https://developer.apple.com/find-my/" rel="nofollow"><em>Find My network</em></a>). Please refer to our <a href="#references">PETS paper and Apple's accessory specification</a> for more details. We provide a schematic overview (from our paper) and explain how we integrate the different steps in OpenHaystack below.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/Resources/FindMyOverview.png"><img src="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/raw/main/Resources/FindMyOverview.png" alt="Find My Overview"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Pairing (1)</h3><a id="user-content-pairing-1" aria-label="Permalink: Pairing (1)" href="#pairing-1"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">To use Apple's Find My network, we generate a public-private key pair on an elliptic curve (P-224). The private key remains on the Mac securely stored in the keychain, and the public key is deployed on the accessory, e.g., an attached micro:bit.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Losing (2)</h3><a id="user-content-losing-2" aria-label="Permalink: Losing (2)" href="#losing-2"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In short, the accessories broadcast the public key as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) advertisements (see <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/Firmware">firmware</a>).
Nearby iPhones will not be able to distinguish our accessories from a genuine Apple device or certified accessory.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Finding (3)</h3><a id="user-content-finding-3" aria-label="Permalink: Finding (3)" href="#finding-3"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When a nearby iPhone receives a BLE advertisement, the iPhone fetches its current location via GPS, encrypts it using public key from the advertisement, and uploads the encrypted report to Apple's server.
All iPhones on iOS 13 or newer do this by default. OpenHaystack is not involved in this step.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Searching (4)</h3><a id="user-content-searching-4" aria-label="Permalink: Searching (4)" href="#searching-4"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Apple does not know which encrypted locations belong to which Apple account or device. Therefore, every Apple user can download any location report as long as they know the corresponding public key. This is not a security issue: all reports are end-to-end encrypted and cannot be decrypted unless one knows the corresponding private key (stored in the keychain). We leverage this feature to download the reports from Apple that have been created for our OpenHaystack accessories. We use our private keys to decrypt the location reports and show the most recent one on the map.</p>
<p dir="auto">Apple protects their database against arbitrary access by requiring an authenticated Apple user to download location reports.
We use our Apple Mail plugin, which runs with elevated privileges, to access the required authentication information. The OpenHaystack app communicates with the plugin while downloading reports. This is why you need to keep Mail open while using OpenHaystack.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How to track other Bluetooth devices?</h2><a id="user-content-how-to-track-other-bluetooth-devices" aria-label="Permalink: How to track other Bluetooth devices?" href="#how-to-track-other-bluetooth-devices"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In principle, any Bluetooth device can be turned into an OpenHaystack accessory that is trackable via Apple's Find My network.
Currently, we provide a convenient deployment method of our OpenHaystack firmwares for a small number of embedded devices (see table below). We also support Linux devices via our generic HCI script.
Feel free to port OpenHaystack to other devices that support Bluetooth Low Energy based on the <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/Firmware">source code of our firmware</a> and the specification in <a href="#references">our paper</a>. Please share your results with us!</p>

<p dir="auto">OpenHaystack Mobile is a complete reimplementation of the OpenHaystack macOS application for smartphones. The app provides the same functionality to create and track accessories and aims to increase the usability, especially for new users. In contrast to the macOS application, the location reports cannot be fetched directly on the smartphone, so the app requires a proxy server hosted on Mac hardware to access the Find My network. The proxy server can be accessed over a network by multiple users simultaneously.</p>
<p dir="auto">To connect to your proxy server set the correct URL in: openhaystack-mobile/lib/findMy/reports_fetcher.dart</p>

<p dir="auto">OpenHaystack Mobile is built with the cross-platform <a href="https://flutter.dev/" rel="nofollow">Flutter framework</a> and currently runs on Android and iOS. More information about the app and usage instructions can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/blob/main/openhaystack-mobile">openhaystack-mobile</a> folder of this repository.</p>

Here’s a personal memoir, with a few lessons in taking memorable snapshots.</em></p><figure></figure><p id="6280">My father was an avid amateur photographer. He loved to take pictures, he invested in expensive cameras, and I’ve plenty of vacation memories where he had one of those cameras in hand.</p><p id="3da3">But organizing the slides afterwards? Labeling them? No way. Pop threw the boxes of slides in big piles and said, “I’ll sort them after I retire.” And, in preparation for his retirement, he put all those slides into five huge boxes — the kind you’d use to ship vinyl records.</p><p id="da0f">Whereupon, three days after my father formally retired in 1988, he died in his sleep.</p><p id="54ec">The slides stayed with my mother. When she moved into assisted living, the boxes went into my sister’s garage. After mom died, three years ago, they came to me. The result was a huge project of scanning family slides — between 8,000 and 10,000 of them.</p><p id="326c">The primary goal was to save the photos before the media deteriorated beyond hope. It was too late in some cases. I remember Pop telling me how much cheaper Ektachrome was (compared to Kodachrome), but many of those images were as ghost-like as a half-remembered dream. Memories fade even faster. Is that a photo of my second cousin Charlotte? I’ve no idea.</p><p id="74e2">For those who want practical lessons, herein you will find two categories:</p><ul><li id="fa6a">How to go about a family photo archive project (or at least how I did it) and</li><li id="8730">Practical suggestions for taking photos that your family will treasure long after you’re gone.</li></ul><p id="412f">This was an oddly spiritual process. We take pictures of the moments we think are valuable or important. So, in the photos he took, I saw my father’s dreams, the things he thought were beautiful, his moments of pride. And in so doing, I gained more understanding of who my parents were. …but I’ll leave that essay to another time.</p><h2 id="1618">Logistics and project scope</h2><p id="03ea">I have spoken with several people who have similar family photo archives, so let me begin by describing I went about the project.</p><p id="4243">Before I began, I had an inexpensive <a href="http://amzn.to/2BzhIkw" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Wolverine slide scanner</a> but I knew a manual unit would not cut it. I bought a heavy-duty slide scanner to help me process the images. It’s a <a href="http://amzn.to/2u4f8Ee" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Canon CanoScan 9000F</a>. I like it, in case you’re shopping for an affordable unit; in particular, I do not loathe the built-in software, which sets it apart from other scanners I’ve used.</p><p id="c5f5">The project, which took me about a year, became a background process. I could scan a box of slides while I was reading my daily morning e-mail, then clean up and share the images during moments of down-time (such as waiting for poky websites to load site statistics). Over a weekend I usually could get through five or six boxes of slides.</p><p id="2d7d">Scanning a box of slides had several steps, each of which became a kind of emotional triage:</p><ul><li id="8ec0">I held up a slide (in front of a desk lamp) to identify it generally and decide if it was worth scanning. In other words: Do I care about this at all? Something out-of-focus easily could be thrown away. A picture of people I didn’t care about (e.g. someone my folks met on a bus tour and never spoke with again) could be dumped, too. It soon became obvious that I didn’t need to scan tourist photos; there are just-so-many pictures you need to see of the Tower of London (which looks the same today as it did in 1972 when my parents visited) or random sunsets over random mountains.</li><li id="551b">If the slide looked interesting, I did a fast preview scan. For instance, if my father took three pictures “just to be sure” I could choose the best image; I could throw out the ones where my brother had his eyes closed. And I could eliminate the pictures that were inherently uninteresting, by which I mean it brought me no sense of nostalgia.</li><li id="af41">By the time I scanned an image, I was pretty committed to keeping it and sharing it with my siblings. Sometimes, if an image was entertaining or meaningful, I’d share it among my friends on Facebook.</li></ul><p id="f7db">From a box of 24–36 slides, I usually shared about 8 with my brother and sisters. By the end of the project, I’d shared 2,800 images with my siblings, and a few hundred on Facebook.</p><p id="1933">I used iPhoto to clean up the images and sort them into a dedicated folder. While tools like PhotoShop certainly could do a better job (and were trotted out for a few special images), 98% were treated with iPhoto’s crop, straighten, and the “Enhance” button. I also added dates and locations to the images’ metadata.</p><p id="29cb">To share the images with my family, I uploaded photos to Flickr. Other photo sharing sites have far better user interfaces, but Flickr has two advantages: I can limit sharing to a set of people marked as friends-and-family, and viewers can comment on the images. Plus you can search images, if you’re smart enough to add tags as you go. (Do.)</p><p id="9e59">Towards the end I also created private Facebook groups, which let me share with cousins as well as siblings, though its search capabilities are poor. It’s been useful for sharing those videos, though, and for encouraging conversations among my relatives.</p><p id="db0d">For general sharing online, I created an Old Family Photos album on Facebook. iPhoto makes it easy to share to an album (though, alas, not to a private group). I’ve been astonished by how many of my family’s history touches a chord. Don’t be shy; but do keep your family’s privacy sensitivities in mind when you share.</p><h2 id="075f">A lifetime in five boxes</h2><p id="d606">The earliest roll of slides was from my parents’ engagement party circa 1941, followed by their honeymoon snapshots in 1942. Thousands of slides record their lives all the way through the 1980s, with a Family Circle gathering held only two months before my father’s death.</p><figure><figcaption><em>My mother at her engagement party, 1941, with her mother and my father’s stepmother</em></figcaption></figure><p id="b86f">Inside the big boxes were two shoeboxes with a hundred 8mm video movies, which went back to the 1920s but mainly record 1950s camping trips. (<a href="https://www.imemories.com/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">iMemories</a> did a very good job at digitizing those.)</p><p id="2aa3">Most images are from family vacations and special occasions, rather than “daily life.” Earlier vacations (1950s and 1960s) are mostly camping trips; later pictures are from trips to Europe, particularly when money eased up after “the kids left home.”</p><p id="d0ad">But more is visible than the campsites and Boy Scout trips. I saw a young couple’s struggles to cope with three young children (I was an afterthought); I watched their idealism diminish and exhaustion set in.</p><h2 id="72cc">Take pictures of interactions, and other lessons</h2><p id="480c">I threw away many thousands of pictures. Some of them undoubtedly had meaning to my parents, but nobody alive cares about those photos. Yet I also came across special moments — and none of us need to have “been there” to appreciate them.</p><p id="6992">In reviewing thousands of slides, I learned quite a bit about taking photos that capture a family’s life. Perhaps these lessons can help you, too, in considering which images to snap — on vacation or in daily life.</p><p id="844e"><strong>Those “title slides” are meaningful after all</strong>. I remember rolling my eyes whenever my father would station me in front of a road sign or National Park entrance. Such pictures seemed really lame.</p><p id="331f">As I reviewed the pictures, though, the title slides were priceless. In all those years, my parents went to dozens of beaches, gardens, and campsites in random mountain ranges. Other than the date on the slide (“Sep 83”) I have no way to identify which one it is. (Occasionally, there’s a scribbled note, like, “Explorer Trip” or “London.” Um, thanks, Pop.)</p><p id="aa29">So I was always glad when I found a photo of us kids standing next to a “Mystic Seaport” sign or “Underground tours” (always looking put-upon and sullen, because we were told to “Stand up straight! And smile — it might turn out good!”).</p><figure><figcaption><em>1963, in… well, see, we can tell!</em></figcaption></figure><p id="b085">Labels matter. Even a few words helped me know when-and-where something happened: “1955 Nova Scotia” or my grandfather’s name. One of the saddest experiences was looking at a family-gathering photo from the 50s with several people in it, and having no idea who’s in it. (Is that my great-aunt? Maybe my sister remembers? …and too often she didn’t.) If you inherit the photos, take the time to identify the people in them. Even if it’s obvious to you that the picture is of cousin Janet who died in 1943, you can’t assume that the next viewer will know.</p><figure><figcaption>Coin operated gas station, 1966</figcaption></figure><p id="111d"><em>Lesson</em>: Do take pictures that give the viewer a clue of where you are, and with whom.</p><p id="2274"><strong>Kodak picture spots aren’t memorable</strong>. Destination pictures surely remind the travelers of their experience. I’m sure that that picture of the beach in Portugal would have encouraged my father to say, “Thelma, remember that night?” That’s fine, for the people who participated. I’ve taken thousands of such photos myself.</p><p id="dd5c">But if I wasn’t there, the image brings me no nostalgia.</p><p id="8423">The worst of these pictures are the touristy photos. My father took plenty of pictures of the Eiffel Tower on their trip in the 70s. But the tower doesn’t look any different today, so I didn’t bother to scan those photos. In fact, I dumped boxes without even looking at the contents, because there’s nothing in that experience that speaks to anyone but the participants.</p><p id="b8ed"><em>Lesson</em>: It’s fine to take pictures that capture a moment for those who were present. But if <em>anyone</em> could have taken that photo, don’t expect anyone to care.</p><p id="1c7c"><strong>People pictures matter the most</strong>. Especially the non-staged ones. The formal pictures of special occasions, where we kids are lined up like we’re in front of a firing squad, are not the ones that bind us.</p><p id="3c15">The best family photos are the ones where we’re clowning around and laughing, or where we’re doing something together, or a moment captured without the subject realizing it. The most precious are those where the family is putting up a pup tent, or using the water pump, or packing the car for a trip.</p><figure><figcaption><em>Hanging up the kittens</em></figcaption></figure><p id="45e4">In general, try to capture your family when they are actively doing something, ideally an entire process. Let it be a photo essay: “Mom making Thanksgiving dinner” or “Daddy taking the kids to the petting zoo.” Don’t choose only the “reveal” moments such as Mom presenting the turkey to the table; include a picture of her hurriedly putting on lipstick before Grandpa arrives, or the kids conked out, asleep in the back seat, on the car trip home.</p><p id="4269">A few exceptions: Nobody looks attractive or interesting while he’s swimming. Few people look great sitting on a towel on the beach, wearing a bathing cap. Also don’t take pictures of people eating dinner, even at a fancy dinner. And while it’s no longer relevant, it was never a good idea to photograph exhausted travelers arriving at an airport gate.</p><figure><figcaption>Playing Mousetrap at home, 1964</figcaption></figure><p id="de29">Include the photographer. I have few pictures of my father, because he was always the guy behind the camera. When he did ask someone to take a picture it was always posed, such as “Mom and Pop standing in front of the Grand Canyon.”</p><p id="4651"><em>Lesson</em>: Photos that capture you “being there” — which means most selfies — rarely have meaning. <em>Doing</em> matters far more.</p><p id="6cc6"><strong>Take photos of daily life</strong>. I’m stunned by the pictures my father <em>didn’t</em> take. There isn’t a single photo that represents what my parents did for a living. They weren’t the type to attend company picnics, fine. But I found nothing indicating “take your daughter to work” or “Mom typing up a report” or “the building I worked in” or “the woman Mom commuted to work with for 10 years.” That would be more understandable if my parents disliked their jobs, but both of them were passionate about their careers.</p><p id="fe60">Take photos of people at rest. Even though I spent much of my childhood writing letters, there is only one photo of me with a pen in my hand — and that was taken by a friend at summer camp. Yet my friends and family all recall me with a book or pen within reach. My father never captured that essential part of who I was.</p><figure><figcaption>Your proprietor writing letters, 1973</figcaption></figure><p id="4c25">Some of the absences may reflect their superstitions. There are zero photos of any woman who is visibly pregnant. Maybe that was considered bad luck; I don’t know.</p><p id="e25b"><em>Lesson</em>: Don’t limit photo-taking to special occasions.</p><p id="b383"><strong>Take at least a short class in photography basics</strong>. Or read a basic book on the topic. As much as my father loved photography, he never got any kind of formal training. I spend a lot of editing time cropping images to take advantage of the simplest rule-of-thirds, for instance.</p><p id="b4ba">Even if you aren’t devoted to photography that much: Crop photos closely. My father took a lot of photos of “Mom in front of a pretty vista” but in the long run I care more about Mom’s expression than the expanse of mountains in the background. Thanks to iPhoto I can zoom in, but a lot of detail is lost.</p><p id="83c6"><em>Lesson</em>: Take the best quality photos you can. Your grandchildren will appreciate it.</p></div><div><p id="cd37">Ultimately, we all take family photos to help ourselves remember the moments we want to recall forever. Nothing suggests that those memories must last beyond our own lifetimes. But if you want your children’s children to recall who you are-and-were, these tips might help you achieve that.</p></div></div>]]></description>
