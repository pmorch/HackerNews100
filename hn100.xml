        <h2>OxCaml is a fast-moving set of extensions to the OCaml programming language.</h2>
        <p>It is both Jane Street’s production compiler, as well as a laboratory for experiments focused towards making
            OCaml better for performance-oriented programming. Our hope is that these extensions can over time be
            contributed to upstream OCaml.</p>
    </div><div>

    <section>
        <h2>OxCaml’s primary design goals are:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>to provide <span>safe, convenient, predictable</span> control over performance-critical
                aspects
                of
                program behavior </li>
            <li>but <span>only where you need it,</span></li>
            <li>and…<span>in OCaml!</span></li>
        </ul>
    </section>


    <section>
        <h2>Let’s talk about what this means!</h2>

        <p>OxCaml’s extensions are meant to make OCaml a great language for performance engineering. Performance
            engineering
            requires control, and we want that control to be:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Safe. Safety is a critical feature for making programmers more productive, and for shipping correct
                code.
                Languages that are pervasively unsafe are too hard to use correctly.</li>
            <li>Convenient. We want to provide control without bewildering programmers, or drowning them in endless
                annotations.
                To achieve this, we aim to maintain OCaml’s excellent type-inference, even as we add considerable
                expressiveness
                to the type-system.</li>
            <li>Predictable. One of the great features of OCaml today is that it’s pretty easy to look at OCaml code and
                understand how it’s going to perform. We want our extensions to maintain and improve on that property,
                by
                making
                key performance details explicit at the type-level.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>By "only where you need it", we mean that OxCaml’s extensions should be pay-as-you-go. While OxCaml aims to
            provide
            more power to optimize, you shouldn’t need to swallow extra complexity when you’re not using that power.</p>
        <p>By "in OCaml", we mean that all valid OCaml programs are also valid OxCaml programs. But our more profound
            goal
            is
            for OxCaml to feel like OCaml evolving into a better version of itself, rather than a new language. For
            that,
            OxCaml
            needs to honor OCaml’s basic design sensibility, and to preserve the safety, ease, and productivity that are
            hallmarks of the language.</p>
    </section>


    <section>
        <h2>OxCaml’s extensions </h2>
        <p>Our extensions can be roughly organized into a few areas:</p>

        <div>
            <div>
                <h2>Fearless concurrency</h2>
                <p>Writing correct concurrent programs is notoriously difficult. OxCaml includes additions to the
                    type
                    system to
                    statically rule out data races.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Layouts</h2>
                <p>OxCaml lets programmers specify the way their data is laid out in memory. It also provides native
                    access
                    to
                    SIMD processor extensions.</p>
            </div>


            <div>
                <h2>Control over allocation</h2>
                <p>OxCaml gives programmers tools to control allocations, reducing GC pressure and making programs
                    more
                    cache efficient and deterministic.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Quality of life </h2>
                <p>OxCaml also contains some extensions that aren’t specifically about systems programming, but
                    which
                    we’ve
                    found helpful in our day-to-day work:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Polymorphic parameters</li>
                    <li>Include functor</li>
                    <li>Labeled tuples</li>
                    <li>Immutable arrays</li>
                </ul>
            </div>



        </div>
    </section>


    <section>
        <h2>Using OxCaml</h2>
        <p>OxCaml is open-source, and we’re excited to welcome experimental users, especially researchers and tinkerers
            who
            can
            kick the tires and provide feedback on the system. We put the emphasis on experimental because OxCaml makes
            no
            promises of stability or backwards compatibility for its extensions (though it does remain backwards
            compatible
            with
            OCaml).</p>
        <p>OxCaml is intended to be easy to use, and to that end comes with modified versions of the standard OCaml
            tool-set,
            including:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Package management, compatible with dune and opam</li>
            <li>Editor integration via the LSP-server</li>
            <li>Source code formatting</li>
            <li>Documentation generation</li>

        </ul>

        <p>Jane Street has long open sourced a bunch of useful libraries and tools. These are now released in two forms:
            one
            for
            upstream OCaml, in which our extensions have been stripped, and one for OxCaml, where the extensions are
            fully
            leveraged.</p>

        <p>Not all extensions are erasable, so some libraries will be available only for OxCaml. We’ll export
            OCaml-compatible
            versions of these libraries when the necessary extensions are integrated upstream.</p>

Shows me a room next to the pool with a keg in the bathtub, I threw them a five and we sat around talking until late in the night. They had some good tips on cheap places to eat, how to get free drinks at the penny slots, that sort of thing.</p><p>And then, every year since that I visited, I did what he did... wander the convention looking for the budget travel crew, the folks who don't do it for a salary and whom this is their reality, and I'd take them on a quest for two dollar hot dogs, show them the little store next to the dive bar where they could stock up on beer and liquor and ice and then disappear into the night like some kind of helpful spirit of the hacker night.</p><p>Anyways... long, profuse thank yous are not needed.

It turned out to be fake. I've never been able to find any references to his "name", the domain name on the email, etc. I don't know he gave me the fake address because of the stigma of a "hacker con" / being worried about real identities, etc. I'd hope it wasn't because he just didn't want to hear from me again (albeit I do recognize that I was pretty insufferable at that age).</p><p>If you remember hanging out w/ a long-haired kid on the last Saturday of Defcon 3 I'd love to touch base.

I feel like I owe something more</p><p>Debt is related to value, which is inherently subjective. In nature, nothing reproducable is one yard long, so we create something and call it a yard, and that first thing becomes the standard. The same is true economically; there's no way to measure what one loaf of bread is inherently worth. Even the time and resources needed to produce it vary depending on countless circumstances. A man with a bread factory will have a much easier time producing one loaf than a homeless man.</p><p>The same is true for pain. What's as trivial as a small papercut to one person may be overwhelmingly traumatic to another person, and another can handle losing a limb as easily as losing a pen. Countless variable psychological circumstances prevent us from making any true measurement of debt.</p><p>But justice requires that we try our best and move on. So we create economies out of barter and then gold and then bills and then credit. Or we create justice systems that are constantly flowing and changing in their understanding of right and wrong, and also value and loss.</p><p>It may be that some people who helped you had no difficulty. I do remember a teacher telling us once to be careful of what we say, because we never know which things we say will stick with someone forever with deep profoundness. Which goes to show that a small off the cuff comment has the very real potential to contribute toward making someone's life significantly better or significantly worse, yet the comment took almost no thought or effort. It <i>cost</i> little.</p><p>There's a moment in a play written by Karol Wojtyla in the 1940s, where Adam Chmielowski asks Madame Helena what it costs her to play Ophelia or Lady MacBeth. She replies, "in a way, it costs me all my life. It is a strange ransom; every time I pay it all over again."</p><p>I have met <i>many</i> people who are convinced that they have been wronged so grievously that the offender must pay every last penny they have or ever will make, and suffer every second of this life as much as possible, and they hope Hell exists purely so that the offender's suffering may not be relieved by the most torturous death imaginable. Such a person will never be satisfied or happy.</p><p>For the little it's worth, my recommendation is to repay people with what good value you justly and reasonably estimate that you owe them for the good they have done to you, and be done with it. If they consider it too much or too little, accomodate them a little, but only within reason. Inversely, if anyone has wronged you, consider their debt paid to you already, since this costs you nothing, whereas exacting justice is tiresome and restless. Besides, forgiving someone's debt to you gives them encouragement to improve, whereas exacting it discourages them and puts them on the defense. That's not to say you shouldn't insist that <i>society as a whole</i> have justice also, for example by calling the police when a legitimate crime has occurred to you or someone else. I'm only talking about the debt in context of two humans.</p></div></td></tr>

If you’ve been regularly using devices featuring lithium-ion batteries for a while, you’ll want to be mindful of issues like overheating or visible swelling and dispose of them properly if you think there’s a potential problem.

</p>

<p>That was about 10 million km (6,213,710 mi) just now.</p>
<p>Pretty empty out here.</p>
<p>Here comes our first planet...</p>
<p>As it turns out, things are pretty far apart.</p>
<p>We’ll be coming up on a new planet soon. Sit tight.</p>
<p>Most of space is just space.</p>
<p>Halfway home.</p>
<p>Destination: Mars!</p>
<p><span id="it-would-take">It would take about seven months to travel this distance in a spaceship. </span><span>&nbsp;</span><span id="better-be-some">Better be some good in-flight entertainment.</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span><span id="in-case-youre">In case you're wondering, you'd need about 2000 feature-length movies to occupy that many waking hours.</span></p>
<p>Sit back and relax. Jupiter is more than 3 times as far as we just traveled.</p>
<p>When are we gonna be there?</p>
<p>Seriously. When are we gonna be there?</p>
<p><span id="this-is-where">This is where we might at least see some asteroids to wake us up. </span><span>&nbsp;</span><span id="too-bad-theyre">Too bad they're all too small to appear on this map.</span></p>
<p>I spy, with my little eye... something black.</p>
<p>If you were on a road trip, driving at 75mi/hr, it would have taken you over 500 years to get here from earth.</p>
<p><span id="all-these-distances">All these distances are just averages, mind you.</span>  <span>&nbsp;</span><span id="the-distance-between">The distance between planets really depends on where the two planets are in their orbits around the sun.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span id="so-if-youre">So if you're planning on taking a trip to Jupiter, you might want to use a different map.</span></p>
<p><span id="if-you-plan">If you plan it right, you can actually move relatively quickly between planets.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span id="the-new-horizons">The New Horizons space craft that launched in 2006 only took 13 months to get to Jupiter.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span id="dont-worry-itll">Don't worry. It'll take a lot less than 13 months to scroll there.</span></p>
 <p>Pretty close to Jupiter now.</p>
 <p>Sorry. That was a lie before. Now we really are pretty close.</p>
<!-- Jupiter 224041px -->
 <p>Lots of time to think out here...</p>
 <p>Pop the champagne! We just passed 1 billion km.</p>
  <p><span id="i-guess-this">I guess this is why most maps of the solar system aren't drawn to scale.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span id="its-not-hard"> It's not hard to draw the planets. </span><span>&nbsp;</span><span id="its-the-empty">It's the empty space that's a problem.</span></p>
 <p>Most space charts leave out the most significant part – all the space.</p>
  <p>We're used to dealing with things at a much smaller scale than this.</p>
 <p><span id="when-it-comes">When it comes to things like the age of the earth, the number of snowflakes in Siberia, the national debt...</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span id="those-things-are">Those things are too much for our brains to handle.</span></p>
 <!--Saturn 412397px-->
 <p>We need to reduce things down to something we can see or experience directly in order to understand them.</p>
 <p>We're always trying to come up with metaphors for big numbers. Even so, they never seem to work.</p>
  <p>Let's try a few metaphors anyway...</p>
  <p><span id="you-would-need">You would need</span> <span id="monitors"></span> <span id="of-these-screens">of these screens lined up side-by-side to show this whole map at once.</span><span id="depth"></span></p>
   <p><span id="if-this-map">If this map was printed from a quality printer (300 pixels per inch) the earth would be invisible, and the width of the paper would need to be 475 feet.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span id="475-feet-is">475 feet is about 1 and 1/2 football fields.</span></p>
   <p><span id="even-though-we">Even though we don’t really understand them, a lot can happen within these massive lengths of time and space.</span><span>&nbsp;</span> <span id="a-drop-of">A drop of water can carve out a canyon.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span id="an-amoeba-can">An amoeba can become a dolphin.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span id="a-star-can">A star can collapse on itself.</span></p>
  <p>It’s easy to disregard nothingness because there’s no thought available to encapsulate it. There’s no metaphor that fits because, by definition, once the nothingness becomes tangible, it ceases to exist.</p>
     <p><span id="its-a-good">It’s a good thing we have these tiny stars and planets, otherwise we’d have no point of reference at all.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span id="wed-be-surrounded">We’d be surrounded by this stuff that our minds weren’t built to understand.</span></p>
    <p>All this emptiness really could drive you nuts. For instance, if you’re in a sensory deprivation tank for too long, your brain starts to make things up. You see and hear things that aren’t there.</p>
     <p>The brain isn't built to handle "empty."</p>
   <p>"Sorry, Humanity," says Evolution. "What with all the jaguars trying to eat you, the parasites in your fur, and the never-ending need for a decent steak, I was a little busy. I didn’t exactly have time to come up with a way to conceive of vast stretches of nothingness."</p>
   <p>Neurologically speaking, we really only deal with matter of a certain size, and energy of a few select wavelengths. For everything else, we have to make up mental models and see if they match up to the tiny shreds of hard evidence that actually feel real.</p>
      <p><span id="the-mental-models">The mental models provided by mathematics are extremely helpful when trying to make sense of these vast distances, but still...</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span id="abstraction-is-pretty">Abstraction is pretty unsatisfying.</span></p>
      <p>When you hear people talk about how, "there’s more to this universe than our minds can conceive of" it's usually a way to get you to go along with a half-baked plot point about UFOs or super-powers in a sci-fi series that you're watching late at night when you can’t get to sleep.</p>
      <p>Even when Shakespeare wrote: "There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy” – he's basically trying to give us a loophole to make the ghost in the story more believable.</p>
      <!-- Uranus 827961px-->
      <p>But all this empty space, these things of a massive scale, really are more than our minds can conceive of. The maps and metaphors fail to do them justice.</p>       
      <p>You look at one tiny dot, then you look for the next tiny dot. Everything in between is inconsequential and fairly boring.</p>
      <p>Emptiness is actually everywhere. It’s something like 99.9999999999999999999958% of the known universe.</p>
      <p>Even an atom is mostly empty space.</p>
      <p>If the proton of a hydrogen atom was the size of the sun on this map, we would need 11 more of these maps to show the average distance to the electron.</p>
      <p><span id="some-theories-say">Some theories say all this emptiness is actually full of energy or dark matter and that nothing can truly be empty...</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span id="but-come-on">but come on, only ordinary matter has any meaning for us.</span></p>
      <p>You could safely say the universe is a "whole lotta nothing."</p>
		<p>If so much of the universe is made up of emptiness, what does that mean to people like us, living on a tiny speck in the middle of all of it?</p>
        <p><span id="is-the-known">Is the known universe 99.9999999999999999999958% empty?</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span id="or-is-it">Or is it 0.0000000000000000000042% full?</span></p>
        <p>With so much emptiness, aren't stars, planets, and people just glitches in an otherwise elegant and uniform nothingness, like pieces of lint on a black sweater?</p>
        <p>But without the tiny dots for it to stretch between, there would be no emptiness to measure, and for that matter, no one around to measure it.</p>
        <p><span id="you-might-say">You might say that so much emptiness makes the tiny bits of matter that much more meaningful - simply by the fact that, against all odds,  they <em>aren't</em> empty.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span id="if-youre-drowning">If you're drowning in the middle of the ocean, a floating piece of driftwood is a pretty big deal.</span></p>
        <p> What if trillions of stars and planets were crammed right next to each other? They wouldn't be special at all.</p>
        <p>It seems like we are both pathetically insignificant, and miraculously important at the same time.</p>
        <p><span id="whether-you-more">Whether you more strongly feel the monumental significance of tiny things or the massive void between them depends on who you are, and how your brain chemistry is balanced at a particular moment. </span><span id="we-walk-around">We walk around with miniature, emotional versions of the universe inside of us.</span></p>
        <p>It's reassuring to know that no matter how depressingly bleak or ridiculously momentous we feel, the universe, judging by its current structure, seems well aware of both extremes.</p>
  <!-- Neptune 1295901px-->
<p>The fact that you're here, in the midst of all this nothing, is pretty amazing when you stop and think about it.</p>
<p>Congratulations on making it this far.</p>
<!-- Pluto 1699574px-->

<p>It’s not the first time I’ve fallen down the rabbit-hole of rendering text in real time. Every time I’ve looked into it an inkling of dissatisfaction always remained, either aliasing, large textures, slow build times, minification/magnification, smooth movement, etc.</p>

<p>Last time I landed on a solution using <a href="https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen">Multi-Channel Signed Distance Fields (SDFs)</a> which was working well. However there was still a few things that bothered me and I just needed a little excuse to jump back into the topic.</p>

<p>That excuse came in the form of getting a new monitor of all things. One of those new OLEDs that look so nice, but that have fringing issues because of their non-standard subpixel structure. I got involved in a <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/25595">GitHub issue</a> discussing this and of course posted my <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/25595#issuecomment-1870511297">unrequested take</a> on how to go about it. This was the last straw I needed to go try and implement glyph rendering again, this time with subpixel anti-aliasing.</p>

<p>Just to start things off, here is a test with a bunch of fonts, trying to test the most common styles, rounded, sharp, very thin lines, etc.</p>

<p><img src="https://osor.io/text/lorem_ipsum_high_res.png" alt="">

<h2 id="but-why-though">But Why Though?</h2>

<p>There was a few things that were bothering me about using SDFs, the main ones being:</p>

<h2 id="quality">Quality</h2>

<p>Certain fonts would struggle to render nicely, especially ones with thin features or lots of detail. SDFs represent “blobby” glyphs nicely, and even simple sharp glyphs if you go the multi-channel route. But at some point you need to increase resolution to get rid of the artifacts.</p>

<p>Here you can see an example of Miama switching between SDF and the new method, note how the thin features were often getting lost, as well as how the “f” was struggling due to its size.</p>



<h2 id="atlas-size">Atlas size</h2>

<p>The SDFs are generated offline then stored to an atlas. Even though SDFs require way less resolution for good output quality, you still need something. Especially for fonts with <strong>a lot</strong> of glyphs this was adding up. I even tried some fonts for Japanese and Chinese which I couldn’t realistically bake to a single atlas due to how big they would have been.</p>

<p>Here you can see the atlas for Miama, which even as a font for only Latin languages without that many special characters comes to a resolution of $4096\times1152$ with each glyph taking a $64\times64$ region.</p>

<p><img src="https://osor.io/text/msdf_atlas_example_no_alpha.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Having multiple fonts available at runtime was adding a significant memory cost and getting them in and out was some significant streaming bandwidth. And the more fonts the bigger the issue.</p>

<h2 id="flexibility">Flexibility</h2>

<p>In general, I found it fiddly to get around issues like minification or implementing new ideas like the subpixel anti-aliasing that kickstarted all this. For a while I also wanted to work with potentially any vector image, which would have required baking, so couldn’t be generated or edited at runtime.</p>

<h2 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h2>

<p>Working with intermediate steps that transform the source data is a raw increase in complexity of the whole system, even if some of that complexity is hidden by some library that could take the glyphs and bake them, it’s still there.</p>

<p>A solution that more directly takes the raw input in the form of the bezier curves that the glyph creator made would be conceptually simpler. Over time I’ve come to appreciate solutions that have less moving parts and where the flow from source data to the desired result is as simple and understandable as possible.</p>

<h2 id="what-now">What Now?</h2>

<p><img src="https://osor.io/text/what_now.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The idea is fairly simple, instead of baking anything to textures, grab the curves that define the <strong>currently visible</strong> glyphs themselves, send them to the GPU and <em>somehow</em> rasterize them. In a way you can see this as moving the necessary rasterization step that previously was offline to be done at runtime.</p>

<p>This would take much less storage compared to the cost per-glyph of a cell in an atlas, it would allow for them to look good at any resolution since we’re rendering the vector representation directly and it would play nice with things like subpixel anti-aliasing, where instead of computing coverage for a single pixel, we’d do it for each of the subpixel elements.</p>

<p>As a very short summary, the solution consist of loading the glyph curve data directly, rasterize them at runtime to an atlas and sample said atlas as required to render the visible glyphs.</p>

<p>The sauce here is keeping glyphs in the atlas as long as they keep being used in subsequent frames. This allows to accumulate and refine the rasterization results, to the extent of getting very high quality sub-pixel anti-aliasing.</p>

<p>I’ll give an overview of the whole pipeline here in execution order. From loading the raw font until they end up on the screen.</p>

<h2 id="processing-the-quadratic-bezier-curves">Processing the Quadratic Bezier Curves</h2>

<p>I’m using <a href="https://freetype.org/">FreeType</a> in an offline tool as an intermediary way to load any of the font formats they support. Then I traverse the curves of each glyph and store them in my asset format that will get passed to the GPU.</p>

<p>The glyphs may contain either <strong>lines</strong>, <strong>quadratic beziers</strong> (3 points) or <strong>cubic beziers</strong> (4 points). To allow for a simpler shader I convert all of these to quadratic beziers.</p>

<p>To transform a <strong>line</strong> to a quadratic bezier is fairly obvious, just create a new control point exactly in the middle of the two existing ones:</p>

<pre><code>// Given the two points for the line
p0 := /*...*/;
p1 := /*...*/;

// Create a new control point in the middle
m := lerp(p0, p1, 0.5);

// And create a quadratic bezier with those
new_curve(p0,m,p1);
</code></pre>

<p>Transforming a <strong>cubic bezier</strong> curve to a quadratic one implies lowering it’s order, which is necessarily a lossy process. In this case I’m choosing to always split the cubic bezier into two quadratics, which works well in all the fonts I’ve tried:</p>

<pre><code>// Given these cubic bezier points
p0 := /*...*/;
p1 := /*...*/;
p2 := /*...*/;
p3 := /*...*/;

// Calculate these extra control points
c0 := lerp(p0, p1, 0.75);
c1 := lerp(p3, p2, 0.75);
m  := lerp(c0, c1, 0.5);

// And create two quadratic bezier curves
new_curve(p0,c0,m);
new_curve(m,c1,p3);
</code></pre>

<p>Here you have a <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/oxeoovjjwk">desmos graph</a> where you can move the points around and see the input cubic bezier and the resulting two quadratic ones.</p>




<p>There’s much more interesting ways to do this split that would reduce the error further, but this works fairly well for the majority of cubic beziers found in the fonts I’ve tried. It’s also possible to use offline tools to do a higher quality transformation into a format that only has quadratic beziers like TrueType (.ttf) which would avoid this transformation altogether.</p>

<p>Here’s some of the points after being loaded, the blue points being the ones that define the beginning and end of the bezier curve (or <em>on</em> points) and the red ones being the middle point of each bezier, defining how it curves (or <em>off</em> points).</p>



<h2 id="calculating-coverage">Calculating Coverage</h2>

<p>Here I’m not doing anything particularly interesting or different than what you might find elsewhere. A ray is shot horizontally, left-to-right on a per-pixel basis, testing against the curves for intersections and accumulating a winding number to see if it’s considered outside (zero) or inside (non-zero). At the end of the day is “just” solving a quadratic equation.</p>

<p>My favorite explanation of the math behind this, with some extra neat diagrams, is in the <a href="https://github.com/GreenLightning/gpu-font-rendering#method">read-me of this GitHub repository by GreenLightning</a> explaining his GPU Font Rendering approach. It would also be a <strong>crime</strong> not to link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SO83KQuuZvg">Sebastian Lague’s Rendering Text video</a> where he covers the principles behind glyph rasterization and his adventures making his solution better. If you’re interested in the source code as well, both of these links can sort you out.</p>

<p>Something worth mentioning is that there can be issues in this step due to inaccuracies on the intersection computation, as the links above already mention. Since I knew I would be accumulating hundreds of samples over time I chose not to do anything explicitly about that at this stage and this has proven to be the right decision so far.</p>

<p>Most of these inaccuracies happen when the samples are at a very specific height and these <em>can</em> still happen in my implementation. That said, maybe one or two samples out of a few hundreds can have incorrect coverage in the worst case but after averaging these are not visible.</p>

<p>At the time of writing I’m accumulating up to 512 samples per-glyph if it stays on screen. If a single sample goes wrong, that means that the pixel is outputting $1/512=0.00195$ or $511/512=0.99804$ instead of $0$ and $1$ respectively which is imperceptible in practice. Furthermore, you could have a threshold where you clamp to the extremes if the coverage is close, making these $0.002$ and $0.998$ be evaluated as $0$ and $1$ respectively.</p>

<p>For completeness, here’s the code to compute the coverage. It iterates over a bitset to access the relevant curves of the glyph and computes a winding number to then transform it to a coverage value. For a reference about how to compute the winding number I refer you again to <a href="https://github.com/GreenLightning/gpu-font-rendering#method">GreenLightning’s repository</a> who explains it wonderfully and provides sample code.</p>

<p>This <code><span>addend</span></code> simply gets added to the previous value on for that texel on the atlas, which will be explained later.</p>

<p>For the <code><span>quasirandom_float2</span></code> I’m using the fantastic <a href="https://extremelearning.com.au/unreasonable-effectiveness-of-quasirandom-sequences/">$R_2$ sequence presented in by Martin Roberts</a>. In <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4dtBWH">this shadertoy</a> you can see how it distributes the sample points to provide some very good coverage over time.</p>

<h2 id="accelerating-curve-access">Accelerating Curve Access</h2>

<p>A good optimization to make here is to split the glyph in some horizontal bands and store which curves of the glyph touch each band. The rasterization code is tracing only horizontally, so with this we can massively reduce the set of curves that each texel will have to test against. To do this I have a bunch of bits per-band per-glyph that represent which local curves to the glyph are present in the band.</p>

<p>Here is a visualization of which curves are on the different bands, highlighted in yellow. You can imagine how a ray traced from left to right of the glyph can just intersect the relevant curves.</p>



<p>You get some great wins by having each texel loop over the curves relevant for that band. However, this can be made faster by accessing bands uniformly per-wave, meaning that all the code that handles iterating over curves can be scalarized, and so are the curve reads (meaning they can happen once per-wave and not once per-thread on the wave). That would look something like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>this_thread_band_index</span> <span>=</span> <span>clamp</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>(</span><span>floor</span><span>(</span><span>uv_y</span> <span>*</span> <span>BAND_COUNT</span><span>)),</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>BAND_COUNT</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>

<span>{</span>
    <span>/* . . . Add the curves for this band to be intersected against . . . */</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And since I’m rasterizing this in compute into an atlas, I can decide which texel each thread is writing to, so I reorganize the threads to be packed horizontally, in row-major order, so the range of bands that each wave touches is minimized compared to other indexing methods like “classic” quads or Morton codes. Here is an example of how the threads are distributed. Using a $9\times11$ glyph and 16-thread waves for simplicity:</p>

<p><img src="https://osor.io/text/wave_distribution.png" alt=""></p>

<p>To distribute the threads like this would be as simple as:</p>

<h2 id="atlas-packing">Atlas Packing</h2>

<p>I started by rasterizing to the screen directly, however computing high quality anti-aliasing every frame as they were being output to the final target was a significant cost.</p>

<p>Thinking about how to get around this it also became obvious that most rendered text stays on screen for many frames, with the same size and position, even as you’re reading this you’re probably not scaling the text, or smoothly scrolling.</p>

<p>Besides this, the same glyph will often appear more than once on screen at the exact same size (just look at how many “e”s there are in this sentence alone). So why bother rendering it multiple times? (Subpixel positioning is a thing and we’ll go back to that later)</p>

<p>So I grabbed the two most well-worn tools in the graphics tool belt, <em>atlases</em> and <em>temporal accumulation</em>.</p>



<p>The idea here is to have an atlas that packs the glyphs reasonably well, if a glyph we want is not on the atlas, we allocate a chunk of it and start rasterizing into it, if a glyph we want is already there, we just use it. At some point in the frame we go over al the glyphs in the atlas and decide whether we keep it (and maybe refine it with more samples) or if it’s not being used and we should free that space.</p>

<p>The atlas will keep in-use glyphs resident all the time, so if text on the screen hasn’t changed for a while, we have nothing to compute there, all the glyphs are ready and we just slap them onto the screen later. There is a cost of adding new glyphs, but we can spread this cost over many frames as we’ll discuss later.</p>

<p>Some notes about this, the inputs to the atlas do have to take a couple things into account that might not be immediately obvious. At the time of writing, if we equate this atlas to a hash-map, the “key” is the following:</p>

<pre><code>Glyph_Key :: struct
{
    font : Font;
    glyph_index : int;

    // u24.8 fixed point
    quantized_size_in_pixels_x : u32;
    quantized_size_in_pixels_y : u32;

    // u0.8 fixed point
    quantized_subpixel_offset_x : u8;
    quantized_subpixel_offset_y : u8;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The font, index of the glyph inside the font and the size are somewhat expected. We also need the subpixel offset though, which is the fractional of the pixel position (as in <code><span>frac</span><span>(</span><span>pixel_position</span><span>)</span></code>). You might want to place the glyph at any position on the screen, not necessarily aligned with the pixel grid, or you might want to smoothly move text (e.g. scrolling). If we didn’t take this into account, then all the anti-aliasing we’re doing would only be valid for a single subpixel position.</p>

<p>Note the usage of fixed point too. This helps collapsing nearby fractional positions and sizes to the same values. Using floating point directly would often generate different values bit-wise, even if mathematically they should have been the same. Using 8 bits for the fractional part offers more than enough resolution for smooth positions and sizes. If moving a single of this $1/256$ increments within the pixel changed the resulting value it would often be displayed in 8 bits per-component render targets or monitor outputs.</p>

<p>That said, you <em>could</em> decide that this is a trade-off you’re willing to make and say that all of your glyphs should be positioned on a pixel boundary. In my experience, slowly moving text looks awful this way since you see it jump from integer pixel boundary to pixel boundary. I wanted to use this as my solution for all text so it’s not something I went for.</p>

<p>Here you can see a comparison between subpixel positioning, aligned to the pixel grid and aligned to a half-resolution pixel grid to simulate seeing this in a monitor that’s half the resolution than the one you’re using.</p>



<p>Zooming into the 1-pixel aligned word makes the stepping even more obvious.</p>



<p>Where if we let the glyphs fall in subpixel positions the movement is dramatically smoother.</p>



<p>That said, it’s still possible to optimize for cases where you know you will do a lot of static text, for example, if you’re doing a text editor and want to use a monospaced font you can force the spacing between characters to be rounded to pixel boundaries. This way every glyph will have the same subpixel offset and always hit the atlas cache for the same glyph.</p>

<p>If also aligning the line breaks to the output pixel grid you get even better reuse, since the same glyphs in a monospaced font in different lines will also hit the same entry on the atlas. See how only new glyphs in the block of text allocate a new entry.</p>



<h3 id="z-order">Z-Order</h3>

<p>A great way I found to place the glyphs somewhat nicely packed at runtime was to use Z-Order Packing and a bitset for free cells within the atlas.</p>

<p>Z-Order curves (via Morton codes) allows you to think of the cells as a long 1D array, allocating a contiguous slice of this 1D array will give you a square in the resulting 2D atlas as long as you’re allocating a power of two number of cells.</p>

<p>A free bit in the bitset represents a free cell, in this case a $16\times16$ texel cell.</p>

<p>When a glyph wants to find a spot, it rounds up its size to the next power of two, so a glyph that needs a $25\times29$ will end up allocating a chunk that’s $32\times32$. This would require 4 $16\times16$ cells, so it’ll look for 4 contiguous free bits and set them, then return the 2D location of that first free cell using Morton codes to go from 1D to 2D.</p>

<p>Note that these contiguous bits also have to be aligned to the number of bits, that is, if looking for 4 free bits, those could start in index 0, 4, 8, 12, etc. If the free bits went from bit 3 to bit 6, when looking at those 4 cells they wouldn’t form a contiguous square.</p>

<p>The code would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>size := /*...*/

max_size_dimension := max(size.x, size.y);
aligned_size := max(BASE_SLOT_SIZE, align_to_next_power_of_2(max(max_size_dimension, 0)));
slot_size := aligned_size / BASE_SLOT_SIZE;
bits_needed := slot_size * slot_size;
assert(is_power_of_2(bits_needed));

index := find_free_contiguous_bits_aligned(bitset, bits_needed);

base_slot_coordinates := decode_morton2_16(xx index);
top_left_texel_coordinates := base_slot_coordinates * BASE_SLOT_SIZE;
</code></pre>

<p>And here there’s a visualization of the order the glyphs go in as well as what happens when some of they get removed and those free cells get reused for future glyphs if they fit.</p>



<h3 id="transposing-z-order">Transposing Z-Order</h3>

<p>The eagle eyed among you that have worked with Z-Order in 2D before might have noticed that this is packing in a transposed Z-Order (so… mirrored N-Order?).</p>

<p>This is because most long and thin glyphs that use the Latin alphabet are vertical, and transposing Z-Order allows to allocate two cells together to form a vertical rectangular section. This makes glyphs for stuff like “l”, “j”, “i” or “1” take half the space.</p>

<p>That said, in cases where most long and thin glyphs are horizontal, for example most of the Arabic languages, the standard Z-Order is more suited.</p>

<p>To do this the code above would be modified to not just use the maximum size of each dimension when calculating the <code><span>bits_needed</span></code>.</p>

<pre><code>aligned_size := ixy(max(cast(s32)BASE_SLOT_SIZE, align_to_next_power_of_2(max(size.x, 0))),
                    max(cast(s32)BASE_SLOT_SIZE, align_to_next_power_of_2(max(size.y, 0))));
slot_size := aligned_size / BASE_SLOT_SIZE;
slot_size.y = max(slot_size.x, slot_size.y);
slot_size.x = max(slot_size.x, slot_size.y / 2);
bits_needed := slot_size.x * slot_size.y;
assert(is_power_of_2(bits_needed));
</code></pre>

<p>And transposing the final coordinates is simply swapping the result.</p>

<pre><code>base_slot_coordinates := decode_morton2_16(xx index);
base_slot_coordinates.x, base_slot_coordinates.y = base_slot_coordinates.y, base_slot_coordinates.x;
top_left_texel_coordinates := base_slot_coordinates * BASE_SLOT_SIZE;
</code></pre>

<p>Here you can see the same demo but allocating glyphs that are double the height.</p>



<h2 id="temporal-accumulation">Temporal Accumulation</h2>

<p>Glyphs staying in the atlas allows to keep throwing samples at them and refine the results further. This way the final result can have very high quality anti-aliasing without having to cast a significant amount of samples when the glyph just appears.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the intro video slowed down and with a full black background to better visualize the glyph output. Also using the Nacelle typeface on its ultra-light variant, to better show thin features.</p>



<p>Even in this slowed-down case it’s hard to see the glyphs visibly refining as you’re reading the text since the results are already fairly high quality. The trick here is that every glyph that first appears gets 8 samples-per-pixel on that first frame, then 4 samples next frame, then 2 and finally 1 every frame afterwards until it reaches a total of 512 samples.</p>

<p>This guarantees a pretty good quality when a glyph first shows up, which is important on smoothly moving or resizing glyphs. Since they do the equivalent of getting initialized every frame.</p>

<p>Another factor that makes this looks better is subpixel anti-aliasing, which will be touched upon in a further section.</p>

<p>When disabling this and just doing a single sample per-pixel every frame, with no subpixel anti-aliasing the slowed down results are as follows.</p>



<p>It’s more obvious how samples keep getting added. Also very interesting how the glyphs appear to shift in positioning. That’s because the initial samples are not at the center of the pixel. That’s fixed by placing the initial samples optimizing for this case, but that’d defeat part of the point of this visualization.</p>

<p>Even in this case, with a single sample and the shifting text it’s still not as dramatically visible as I would have imagined, showcasing how well the refinement idea and temporal accumulation works in principle.</p>

<p>Zooming in on a word in particular demonstrates how on the first frame the glyph has no anti-aliasing at all and the results are either black or white, then it keeps refining and shifting position until getting to a better final result with a few dozen samples.</p>



<p>And for completeness, with all the quality optimizations on, starting with 8 samples and with subpixel anti-aliasing that word looks like this.</p>



<p>This system is also easily tunable to achieve the required levels of quality and performance. Some of the knobs to twist would be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How many samples/rays to add every frame.</li>
  <li>Increase samples on the first few frames of a glyph or not.</li>
  <li>Having a cap of “total samples” allowed per-frame to keep cost bounded.</li>
  <li>Time-slice the update of existing glyphs, that is, adding samples every few frames instead of every frame.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another note is that the cost of casting a ray scales linearly with the amount of curves it’s going to have to intersect for a given glyph. So for more precise cost-gating it might be worth to use that as a metric instead. Meaning that you’d allow to do a certain number of intersected curves per-frame.</p>

<p>It’s worth mentioning that performance hasn’t been a concern in my experience with this system so far. The full-screen of text of the intro peaks at about 0.1 milliseconds in my 9070 at 4k. And that cost quickly tapers down to zero when glyphs have reached the max number of samples (set at the time of writing to 512 but can be easily lowered).</p>

<p>Overall this system works <em>shockingly</em> well. Most text presented to users often stays on screen completely static, which lets it converge to high quality. Even as it shows up, the speed at which we look at words and read them is orders of magnitude slower that the time it takes a glyph to look very good. In general, I’ve found it imperceptible that the text is converging over time while at the same time it always looks nicely anti-aliased.</p>

<h2 id="subpixel-anti-aliasing-and-fringing">Subpixel Anti-Aliasing and Fringing</h2>

<p>The gist of subpixel anti-aliasing is start thinking of the individual red, green and blue subpixel elements that for your monitor pixel as individual sample points, or rather, sample areas. Roughly you can consider the subpixel elements to be the actual “pixels” you want to render into.</p>

<p>In a traditional RGB LCD layout like the following, your horizontal resolution effectively triples. In traditional 4k you’d go from $3840\times2160$ to $3840\times6480$.</p>

<p><img src="https://osor.io/text/subpixel_zoo_rgb_structure.png" alt="">
<em>Image from <a href="https://geometrian.com/resources/subpixelzoo/">Subpixel Zoo</a></em></p>

<p>Getting all this effective resolution is great! And since the light is getting mixed from neighboring pixels, there’s no reason to get bad color fringing.</p>

<p>As I’ve already hinted at though, the monitor I’m using is far from this 3 vertical stripes of red, green and blue, and looks like this instead.</p>

<p><img src="https://osor.io/text/rtings_subpixel_layout_oled_g9.jpg" alt="">
<em>Image from <a href="https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/samsung/odyssey-oled-g9-g95sc-s49cg95">RTings Review of Oled G9</a></em></p>

<p>Which causes problematic fringing. And this is far from being the worst case out there, with monitors having wild arrangements like some of the ones you can see in <a href="https://geometrian.com/resources/subpixelzoo/">Subpixel Zoo</a>. A notorious recent one is <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/25595#issuecomment-1512405626">LG WOLED having a red-white-blue-green</a> structure, so it has an extra white-only subpixel and has the green and blue ones swapped from the standard order.</p>

<p>To show a more direct comparison on my current monitor. A default red-green-blue subpixel structure made of equal vertical rectangles would look like this. With very visible green fringing on top and magenta at the bottom.</p>

<p><img src="https://osor.io/text/text_with_fringing.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Whereas if I set the subpixel structure on the solution presented in this article to match the one on my monitor it looks like this. Where even with subpixel anti-aliasing on there’s next to no fringing while keeping a very smooth result.</p>

<p><img src="https://osor.io/text/text_without_fringing.png" alt=""></p>

<p>The big payoff! Finally rendering good looking text with subpixel anti-aliasing and no color fringing.</p>

<p>To achieve this I’ve set up a little editor where I could play with the subpixel elements position, the inner white square is the pixel, and each of the colored quads represent where I’m sampling the results of each subpixel element. Note that it’s going out of bounds of the pixel, which I’ll touch on in the next section.</p>

<p><img src="https://osor.io/text/subpixel_antialiasing_oled.png" alt=""></p>

<p>If zooming in you can see how most of those pixels we’re sending to the monitor are not white, in fact there’s very few that are $RGB(1,1,1)$.</p>

<p><img src="https://osor.io/text/subpixel_antialiasing_zoomed.png" alt=""></p>

<p>But when they’re outputting on the monitor, light from all the subpixels blends in such a way that the result is a smooth white output. Getting the desired anti-aliasing effect and better representing the intended shape of the glyph.</p>

<p><img src="https://osor.io/text/subpixel_antialiasing_zoomed_monitor_picture.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Note that a lot of these features are only one to one-and-a-half pixels wide. They also often fall in-between pixel cells since I’m not doing any <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/truetype/hinting">hinting</a>. This is picked on purpose as a hard example for the renderer to handle and to show the effectiveness of good subpixel anti-aliasing.</p>

<h3 id="overlapping-subpixels">Overlapping Subpixels</h3>

<p>As I was trying to match my subpixel structure I’ve found that overlapping the subpixel elements would give more accurate results. Which intuitively makes sense since light naturally mixes and diffuses slightly from the subpixel elements, so the sampled area for a given subpixel will be larger than the subpixel itself physically is. Almost behaving like a tiny point light.</p>

<p>So naturally you might expect a setup like this.</p>

<p><img src="https://osor.io/text/subpixel_antialiasing_rgb.png" alt=""></p>

<p>However letting the subpixel elements overlap each other gives better results. Also here you can see two examples of a “classic” LCD subpixel arrangement. If you’re seeing this on a screen with this arrangement it’s probably the best quality anti-aliasing you’d see in this whole article. Because all the other captures have been done with my monitor’s subpixel structure arrangement.</p>

<p><img src="https://osor.io/text/subpixel_antialiasing_rgb_expanded.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Note that the areas also should bleed outside the pixel itself because they are surrounded by (normally) identical pixels with identical subpixel elements. Light is not only bleeding and mixing with the light from a single pixel, but also with the neighboring subpixels.</p>

<p>As I was writing this article I found the <a href="https://medium.com/@evanwallace/easy-scalable-text-rendering-on-the-gpu-c3f4d782c5ac">Easy Scalable Text Rendering article by Evan Wallace</a> which suggests needing to blur horizontally after rendering with subpixel anti-aliasing. Interestingly this is effectively the same thing as considering the subpixel elements themselves to be bigger and overlapping.</p>

<h2 id="a-plea">A Plea</h2>

<p>I <em>really</em> wish that having access to arbitrary subpixel structures of monitors was possible, perhaps given via the common display protocols. This would enhance subpixel anti-aliasing in general and text specifically, even in monitors that have “standard” orders, since you can be more fine-grained for the specific hardware.</p>

<p>This would also give freedom to display manufacturers to not have to fear trying an otherwise better subpixel structure because of issues with text rendering. Samsung changed their subpixel structure on QD-OLED to try to minimize issues like this from G8 to G9. And still on LG’s WOLED and Samsung’s QD-OLED fringing is commonly cited as one of the most notorious problems on monitors that use them.</p>

<p>It’s is just software, we can fix this, they shouldn’t be forced to change hardware to account for the failures of software.</p>

<h2 id="final-words">Final Words</h2>

<p>Good user interfaces and especially great text is a soft spot of mine. It has the potential to carry the perceived quality of a product to an degree that’s sometimes underrated. A prime example of this is the fantastic work that Atlus consistently puts out in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4d6x1CIgLSc">Persona</a> series or more recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4ypdFi8zo8">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>. I also have to mention <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhNoX5F81iw">Nier: Automata</a> as a personal favorite.</p>

<p>And it makes sense! Games will often present you with text that’s meant to grab your attention. When a text box, a menu, a title, an announcement or anything in-between shows up in a game there’s an implied focus point put on it. It looking sub-par can impact the experience as much as a badly rendered 3D scene would. So it follows that this aspect of the presentation should get their fair share of love as well.</p>

<p>I hope you’ve found this useful! I’d love to see more attempts to make glyph rendering in real time better and in this fashion I wish this comes across as a good motivator for more people to go tackle this.</p>

<p>As always, if you have any comments or there’s any questions please reach out! You can find me in most places as some variation of “osor_io” or “osor-io” as well as with the links at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>Cheers! 🍻</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>The <a href="https://jemalloc.net/">jemalloc</a> memory allocator was first conceived in early 2004, and has
been in public use for about 20 years now. Thanks to the nature of open source software licensing,
jemalloc will remain publicly available indefinitely. But active upstream development has come to an
end. This post briefly describes jemalloc’s development phases, each with some success/failure
highlights, followed by some retrospective commentary.</p>

<h2 id="phase-0-lyken">Phase 0: Lyken</h2>

<p>In 2004 I began work on the Lyken programming language in the context of scientific computing. Lyken
was an eventual dead end, but its manual memory allocator was functionally complete by May 2005.
(The garbage collector which was to leverage its features was never completed.) In September 2005 I
started integrating the allocator into FreeBSD, and in March 2006 I removed the allocator from
Lyken, in favor of thin wrappers around system allocator functionality.</p>

<p>Why remove the memory allocator from Lyken after so much effort went into it? Well, once the
allocator was integrated into FreeBSD, it became apparent that the only feature missing from the
system allocator was a mechanism for tracking allocation volume in order to trigger per thread
garbage collection. And that could be implemented via thin wrappers using thread-specific data and
<a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/dlsym.3.html">dlsym(3)</a>. Interestingly, many years later
jemalloc even added the statistics gathering that Lyken would have needed.</p>

<h2 id="phase-1-freebsd">Phase 1: FreeBSD</h2>

<p>Back in 2005 the transition to multi-processor computers was ongoing. FreeBSD had Poul-Henning
Kamp’s excellent phkmalloc memory allocator, but that allocator had no provisions for parallel
thread execution. Lyken’s allocator seemed like an obvious scalability improvement, and with
encouragement from friends and colleagues I integrated what quickly became known as jemalloc. Ah,
but not so fast! Shortly after integration it became apparent that jemalloc had terrible
fragmentation issues under some loads, notably those induced by <a href="https://kde.org/">KDE</a>
applications. Just when I thought I was mostly done, this real-world failure called jemalloc’s
viability into question.</p>

<p>In brief, the fragmentation issue arose from using a unified extent allocation approach (i.e. no
size class segregation). I had taken basic inspiration from Doug Lea’s
<a href="https://gee.cs.oswego.edu/pub/misc/malloc.c">dlmalloc</a>, but without the intertwined battle-tested
heuristics that avoided many of the worst fragmentation issues. Much frantic research and
experimentation ensued. By the time jemalloc was part of a FreeBSD release, its layout algorithms
had completely changed to use size-segregated regions, as described in the <a href="https://people.freebsd.org/~jasone/jemalloc/bsdcan2006/jemalloc.pdf">2006 BSDCan jemalloc
paper</a>.</p>

<h2 id="phase-15-firefox">Phase 1.5: Firefox</h2>

<p>In November 2007, <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Mozilla Firefox</a> 3 was nearing
release, and high fragmentation was an unresolved issue, especially on Microsoft Windows. Thus began
a year of working with Mozilla on memory allocation. Porting jemalloc to Linux was trivial, but
Windows was another matter. The canonical jemalloc sources were in the FreeBSD libc library, so we
essentially forked jemalloc and added portability code, upstreaming anything that was relevant to
FreeBSD. The entire implementation was still in one file, which reduced the friction of fork
maintenance, but the implementation complexity definitely surpassed what is reasonable in a single
file sometime during this phase of development.</p>

<p>Years later, Mozilla developers made significant contributions to the upstream jemalloc in an effort
to move away from their fork. Unfortunately, Mozilla benchmarks consistently showed that the forked
version outperformed the upstream version. I don’t know if this was due to overfitting to a local
optimum or an actual indication of performance regression, but it remains one of my biggest jemalloc
disappointments.</p>

<h2 id="phase-2-facebook">Phase 2: Facebook</h2>

<p>When I started work at Facebook in 2009, I was surprised to discover that the biggest impediment to
ubiquitous jemalloc use in Facebook infrastructure was instrumentation. Critical internal services
were in the awkward situation of depending on jemalloc to keep memory fragmentation under control,
but engineers needed to debug memory leaks with <a href="https://github.com/google/tcmalloc">tcmalloc</a> and
the <code>pprof</code> heap profiling tool that is part of
<a href="https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools">gperftools</a>. <code>pprof</code>-compatible heap profiling
functionality headlined the jemalloc 1.0.0 release.</p>

<p>jemalloc development migrated to <a href="https://github.com/jemalloc/">GitHub</a> and continued sporadically
for the next few years as issues and opportunities arose. Other developers started contributing
significant functionality. Version 3.0.0 introduced extensive testing infrastructure, as well as
<a href="https://valgrind.org/">Valgrind</a> support. The 4.x release series introduced decay-based purging and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a>-formatted telemetry. The 5.x series transitioned from
“chunks” to “extents” to pave the way for better interaction with 2 MiB huge pages.</p>

<p>Somewhat more controversially, I removed Valgrind support in 5.0.0 because it was a significant
maintenance complication (numerous tendrils in subtle places), and it was unused inside Facebook;
other tools like <code>pprof</code> and <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/MemorySanitizer.html">MemorySanitizer</a>
dominated. I had received very little feedback about Valgrind support, and extrapolated that it was
not being used. In retrospect, that seems not to have been the case. In particular, the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust
language</a> directly incorporated jemalloc into compiled programs, and I
think there was some overlap between Rust developers and Valgrind developers. People were angry.
jemalloc was probably booted from Rust binaries sooner than the natural course of development might
have otherwise dictated.</p>

<p>Facebook’s internal telemetry is a wonder to behold, and it is a massive boon to have performance
data from myriad services informing memory allocator development. I don’t think it’s an accident
that two of the fastest memory allocators of the past decade (tcmalloc and jemalloc) benefit from
such data. Even “simple” things like fast-path optimizations are much easier to get right when there
are aggregated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perf_%28Linux%29">Linux perf</a> data on hand. Harder
things like fragmentation avoidance are still hard, but if thousands of distinct workflows behave
well with no outlier regressions, then a change is probably safe. jemalloc has benefited immensely
from being integral to the Facebook infrastructure in terms of performance, resilience, and
consistent behavior. Additionally, jemalloc’s own integrated statistics reporting capabilities arose
directly in response to this ubiquitous telemetry environment, and this turned out to generally
benefit both jemalloc development and non-Facebook application tuning/debugging far in excess of the
implementation effort required.</p>

<p>During my last year at Facebook I was encouraged to build a small jemalloc team so that we could
tackle some big tasks that would have been otherwise daunting. On top of major performance
improvements, we got things like continuous integration testing and comprehensive telemetry. When I
left Facebook in 2017, the jemalloc team carried on doing excellent development and maintenance work
for several years, almost entirely without my involvement, under the leadership of my esteemed
colleague, Qi Wang, and as evidenced by the commit history, with the excellent contributions of many
others.</p>



<p>The nature of jemalloc development noticeably shifted around the time that Facebook rebranded itself
as Meta. Facebook infrastructure engineering reduced investment in core technology, instead
emphasizing <em>return</em> on investment. This is apparent in the jemalloc commit history. In particular,
the seeds for principled huge page allocation (HPA) were sown way back in 2016! HPA work continued
apace for several years, slowed, then stagnated as tweaks piled on top of each other without the
requisite refactoring that keeps a codebase healthy. This feature trajectory recently cratered. The
heartbreak for me is somewhat blunted since I have not been closely involved for years, but as a
result of recent changes within Meta we no longer have anyone shepherding long-term jemalloc
development with an eye toward general utility.</p>

<p>I don’t want to dwell on drama, but it is perhaps worth mentioning that we reached a sad end for
jemalloc in the hands of Facebook/Meta even though most of the people involved were acting in good
faith. Corporate cultures shift in compliance with both external and internal pressures. And people
find themselves in impossible situations where the main choices are 1) make poor decisions under
extreme pressure, 2) comply under extreme pressure, or 3) get routed around. As individuals we
sometimes have enough influence to slow organizational degradation, maybe even contribute to
isolated renaissances, but none of us can prevent the inevitable.</p>

<p>I remain very grateful to my former colleagues for all their excellent work on jemalloc, and
Facebook/Meta in general for investing so much, for so long.</p>

<h2 id="phase-4-stasis">Phase 4: Stasis</h2>

<p>What now? As far as I am concerned, “upstream” jemalloc development has concluded. Meta’s needs
stopped aligning well with those of external uses some time ago, and they are better off doing their
own thing. Were I to reengage, the first step would be at least hundreds of hours of refactoring to
pay off accrued technical debt. And I’m not sufficiently excited by what would come after to pay
such a high upfront cost. Perhaps others will create viable forks, whether from the <code>dev</code> branch or
from the 5.3.0 release (already three years old!).</p>

<p>In above sections I mentioned several phase-specific failures, but there were some generic failures
that surprised me despite a career focused on open source development.</p>

<ul>
  <li>As mentioned, removing Valgrind caused some bad sentiment. But the root of the problem is lack of
awareness about external uses and needs. I probably would have worked with others to preserve
Valgrind support if I’d known that it mattered to anyone. As another example, I was completely
unaware of jemalloc’s use as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)">Android</a> memory allocator for perhaps
two years. And years later, unaware of its replacement until after the fact.</li>
  <li>Even though jemalloc development remained completely out in the open (not siloed inside Facebook),
the project never grew to retain primary contributors from other organizations. The Mozilla effort
by Mike Hommey to move Firefox to the upstream jemalloc was a near miss. Efforts by others to
transition to a <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a>-based build system stalled multiple times, and never
crossed the finish line. I knew from hard experience with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_(operating_system)">Darwin</a> that internally siloed open
source projects cannot thrive (<a href="https://hhvm.com/">HHVM</a> was a repeat lesson), but jemalloc needed
more than open development to thrive as an independent project.</li>
</ul>

<p>jemalloc was an odd diversion for me, since I have been a strong proponent of garbage collection
over manual memory management for over 25 years. Personally I’m happy to be working again on
garbage-collected systems, but jemalloc was a tremendously fulfilling project. Thank you to everyone
who made this project so worthwhile, collaborators, supporters, and users alike.</p>

            In a televised address to the nation, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the military operation had “struck at the head of Iran’s nuclear weaponization program” and targets included Iran’s main enrichment facility in Natanz, Iranian nuclear scientists, and Iran’s ballistic missiles program.

            Friday’s strikes suggest Netanyahu saw a window of opportunity to meet Israel’s longstanding objective of obliterating Iran’s nuclear program. Iran is in its <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/20/politics/intelligence-israel-possible-strike-iran-nuclear-facilities">weakest military position in decades</a> following crippling economic sanctions, previous Israeli strikes on its air defenses and decimation of its most powerful regional proxies, including Hezbollah.

            The United States was not involved in the strikes, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, noting that Israel had “advised” the US that it believed the “action was necessary for its self-defense.” Earlier, Trump <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/12/politics/trump-israel-iran-strike">had warned</a> of the possibility of “massive conflict” in the Middle East that could take place “soon.”

            And if Israel and Iran become entangled in wider conflict, it could risk drawing in the United States into the fray.

    </div><p>Erythritol may impair cellular functions essential to maintaining brain blood vessel health, according to researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder. Findings suggest that erythritol increases oxidative stress, disrupts nitric oxide signaling, raises vasoconstrictive peptide production, and diminishes clot-dissolving capacity in human brain microvascular endothelial cells.</p>

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    <p>Erythritol has become a fixture in the ingredient lists of protein bars, low-calorie beverages, and diabetic-friendly baked goods. Its appeal lies in its sweetness-to-calorie ratio, roughly 60–80% as sweet as sucrose with a tiny fraction of the energy yield, and its negligible effect on <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+glucose/" rel="tag">blood glucose</a>. Erythritol is also synthesized endogenously from glucose and fructose via the pentose phosphate pathway, leaving baseline levels subject to both dietary and metabolic influences.</p>
<p>Concerns about erythritol's safety have escalated following epidemiological studies linking higher plasma concentrations with increased cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Positive associations between circulating erythritol and incidence of heart attack and stroke have been observed in U.S. and European cohorts, independent of known cardiometabolic risk factors. A causal mechanism for the link has remained elusive.</p>
<p>In the study, "The Non-Nutritive Sweetener Erythritol Adversely Affects Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cell Function," <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/10.1152/japplphysiol.00276.2025" target="_blank">published</a> in the <i>Journal of Applied Physiology</i>, researchers designed in vitro experiments to test the cellular consequences of erythritol exposure on cerebral endothelial function.</p>
<p>Human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells were cultured and exposed to an amount of erythritol equivalent to consuming a typical beverage. Experimental conditions included five biological replicates per group.</p>

                                                                                                        
    
                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>Cellular assays measured <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/oxidative+stress/" rel="tag">oxidative stress</a>, antioxidant protein expression, nitric oxide bioavailability, endothelin production, and fibrinolytic capacity. Capillary electrophoresis immunoassay and ELISA were used to quantify expression of superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1), catalase, endothelial <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/nitric+oxide/" rel="tag">nitric oxide</a> synthase (eNOS), phosphorylated eNOS, endothelin-1 (ET-1), and tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA).</p>
<p>Cells exposed to erythritol exhibited a substantial increase in oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species levels rose by approximately 75% relative to untreated controls. Antioxidant defense markers were also elevated, with SOD-1 expression increasing by approximately 45% and catalase by approximately 25%.</p>
<p>Nitric oxide production declined by nearly 20% in response to erythritol. Although total eNOS expression remained unchanged, phosphorylation at the Ser1177 site, which is associated with enzymatic activation, fell by approximately 33%. In contrast, phosphorylation at the inhibitory Thr495 site increased by approximately 39%.</p>
<p>In another test, t-PA release in response to thrombin stimulation was blunted in erythritol-treated cells, indicating reduced fibrinolytic responsiveness.</p>
<p>The researchers conclude that erythritol exposure disrupts multiple mechanisms vital to maintaining cerebral endothelial health. Although results are limited to acute in vitro conditions, the findings align with prior epidemiological associations between erythritol and elevated stroke risk.</p>
<p>The authors recommend further investigation using long-term and in vivo models, citing the need for clinical studies to clarify whether repeated dietary exposure to erythritol carries cerebrovascular consequences.</p>

<h2 id="when-limits-disappear-quality-should-matter-more"><a href="#when-limits-disappear-quality-should-matter-more" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>When Limits Disappear, Quality Should Matter More</span></a></h2>
<p>You can vibe code at a <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/videogame">buttery-smooth 120fps in Zed</a> and generate code 24 hours a day if you're so inclined.
But in a world of abundance, the bar should be higher for quality.</p>
<p>As software engineers, we should measure our contribution not in lines of code generated, but in reliable, well-designed systems that are easy to change and a pleasure to use.</p>
<p>There's a lot of talk online about the 10x (or even the 100x!) engineer.
Most people are talking about how AI can help us make software faster and help us make more software.
As craftspeople, we should look at AI and ask, "How can this help me build better software?"</p>
<h2 id="system-design-matters-more"><a href="#system-design-matters-more" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>System Design Matters More</span></a></h2>
<p>If you've spent any time in a codebase that solves real problems, I'm sure you can relate to this sentiment: "I want this to be better, but I don't have time to fix it."
The system is broken in ways that hobble our productivity and imagination, but we need to ship.
There's always an incentive to achieve our goals by bending the existing system instead of revising it, even if that leaves the system "not quite right, but good enough."</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://zed.dev/values">values at Zed</a> of "Shipping &amp; Craftsmanship" exist as a pair for a reason.
We should feel urgency, but we shouldn't be using urgency as an excuse to cut corners.
Short-term gains aren't worth the cost of suboptimal velocity for the lifetime of the company.
This is even more true now that a gnarly code base hinders not only our own ability to work in it, but also the ability of AI tools to be effective in it.</p>
<p>Recognizing this dynamic doesn't make it any easier to resolve.
Since we're only learning about a system as we build it, we may not even know what the "right design" is until rather far into the system's development.
Each of our many decisions may make sense in the moment, but over time they accumulate, and before we know it we find ourselves working in what feels like a legacy codebase—despite trying at every turn to avoid that outcome.</p>
<p>All of this makes it more critical than ever to evaluate contributions not by how many lines of code you touched, but by your impact on how reliable, understandable, and changeable the resulting system will be.</p>
<h2 id="taking-ownership-and-raising-the-bar"><a href="#taking-ownership-and-raising-the-bar" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Taking Ownership and Raising the Bar</span></a></h2>
<p>So how do we build good software? There are probably multiple ways, but I'll tell you mine.
It requires taking ownership of the user's experience.</p>
<p>As a user of a code editor, I want a fast experience.
If complex 3D games can run at 120 frames per second, there's no reason my editor couldn't render 2D text and rectangles that fast.
That was my initial goal for Zed, although at the time I didn't know how to achieve it.
One thing I did know, based on my past experience creating a <a href="https://github.com/atom/atom">code editor named Atom</a> (and <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">its spinoff, Electron</a>), is that I'd have to look beyond web technology.
Otherwise, I'd never be able to achieve an experience better than a web browser.</p>
<p>So I started over.
But starting over meant taking on a much wider scope, learning a systems programming language with a sadistically helpful compiler, and learning to write shaders.
All of that added risk to the project, but without it, Zed couldn't have become what it is today.
Luckily, that kind of learning and de novo software development just got vastly easier, thanks to the power of LLMs.
Even with hallucinations, I would have given almost anything to have a language model chat me through Rust borrow checker errors when I was first learning.</p>
<p>Taking full ownership over the user's experience is not as risky as it used to be.
If we have the ambition to pursue an amazing experience, but only some of the skills necessary to deliver it, AI can help us overcome the knowledge gaps standing in our way.
It won't be a drop-in substitute for actual expertise, and we'll still make mistakes as we go, but it will let us experiment faster, learn faster, and iterate faster than we ever could in the old days.</p>
<p>Aim high! The barrier to entry to building truly great experiences has never been lower.</p>

<p>AI agents have not existed for very long.
We've already learned a lot about how best to use them, but there remains much to learn.
What's more, the tools themselves continue to improve, which creates ever-moving goalposts in our pursuit of understanding.</p>
<p>In this rapidly evolving environment, how can we determine which skills and techniques work best with which tools?
The same way we always have: sharing knowledge with one another!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
												<p>Late last year, security researchers made a startling discovery: Kremlin-backed disinformation campaigns were bypassing moderation on social media platforms by leveraging the same malicious advertising technology that powers a sprawling ecosystem of online hucksters and website hackers. A new report on the fallout from that investigation finds this dark ad tech industry is far more resilient and incestuous than previously known.</p>
<div id="attachment_71492"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71492" decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/maladtech.png" alt="" width="750" height="422"></p><p id="caption-attachment-71492">Image: Infoblox.</p></div>
<p>In November 2024, researchers at the security firm <strong>Qurium</strong> published an investigation into “<a href="https://www.cybercom.mil/Media/News/Article/3895345/russian-disinformation-campaign-doppelgnger-unmasked-a-web-of-deception/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doppelganger</a>,” a disinformation network that promotes pro-Russian narratives and infiltrates Europe’s media landscape by pushing fake news through a network of cloned websites.</p>
<p>Doppelganger campaigns use specialized links that bounce the visitor’s browser through a long series of domains before the fake news content is served. Qurium <a href="https://www.qurium.org/forensics/when-kehr-meets-vextrio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> Doppelganger relies on a sophisticated “domain cloaking” service, a technology that allows websites to present different content to search engines compared to what regular visitors see. The use of cloaking services helps the disinformation sites remain online longer than they otherwise would, while ensuring that only the targeted audience gets to view the intended content.</p>
<p>Qurium discovered that Doppelganger’s cloaking service also promoted online dating sites, and shared much of the same infrastructure with <strong>VexTrio</strong>, which is thought to be the oldest malicious traffic distribution system (TDS) in existence. While TDSs are commonly used by legitimate advertising networks to manage traffic from disparate sources and to track who or what is behind each click, VexTrio’s TDS largely manages web traffic from victims of phishing, malware, and social engineering scams.</p>
<h2>BREAKING BAD</h2>
<p>Digging deeper, Qurium noticed Doppelganger’s cloaking service used an Internet provider in Switzerland as the first entry point in a chain of domain redirections. They also noticed the same infrastructure hosted a pair of co-branded affiliate marketing services that were driving traffic to sketchy adult dating sites: <strong>LosPollos[.]com</strong> and <strong>TacoLoco[.]co</strong>.</p>
<p>The LosPollos ad network incorporates many elements and references from the hit series “Breaking Bad,” mirroring the fictional “Los Pollos Hermanos” restaurant chain that served as a money laundering operation for a violent methamphetamine cartel.</p>
<div id="attachment_71484"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71484" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lospollos_mainpage.png" alt="" width="749" height="497" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lospollos_mainpage.png 2710w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lospollos_mainpage-768x510.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lospollos_mainpage-1536x1020.png 1536w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lospollos_mainpage-2048x1360.png 2048w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lospollos_mainpage-782x519.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 749px) 100vw, 749px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-71484">The LosPollos advertising network invokes characters and themes from the hit show Breaking Bad. The logo for LosPollos (upper left) is the image of Gustavo Fring, the fictional chicken restaurant chain owner in the show.</p></div>
<p>Affiliates who sign up with LosPollos are given JavaScript-heavy “<strong>smartlinks</strong>” that drive traffic into the VexTrio TDS, which in turn distributes the traffic among a variety of advertising partners, including dating services, sweepstakes offers, bait-and-switch mobile apps, financial scams and malware download sites.</p>
<p>LosPollos affiliates typically stitch these smart links into <strong>WordPress</strong> websites that have been hacked via known vulnerabilities, and those affiliates will earn a small commission each time an Internet user referred by any of their hacked sites falls for one of these lures.</p>
<div id="attachment_71485"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71485" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lospollos_subdomain_linkedIn_announcement.png" alt="" width="745" height="321" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lospollos_subdomain_linkedIn_announcement.png 1146w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lospollos_subdomain_linkedIn_announcement-768x331.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lospollos_subdomain_linkedIn_announcement-782x337.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-71485">The Los Pollos advertising network promoting itself on LinkedIn.</p></div>
<p>According to Qurium, TacoLoco is a traffic monetization network that uses deceptive tactics to trick Internet users into enabling “push notifications,” a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cross-platform browser standard</a> that allows websites to show pop-up messages which appear outside of the browser. For example, on Microsoft Windows systems these notifications typically show up in the bottom right corner of the screen — just above the system clock.</p>
<p>In the case of VexTrio and TacoLoco, the notification approval requests themselves are deceptive — disguised as “CAPTCHA” challenges designed to distinguish automated bot traffic from real visitors. For years, VexTrio and its partners have successfully tricked countless users into enabling these site notifications, which are then used to continuously pepper the victim’s device with a variety of phony virus alerts and misleading pop-up messages.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/resources/news/godaddy-annual-cybersecurity-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a December 2024 annual report</a> from <strong>GoDaddy</strong>, <em>nearly 40 percent of compromised websites in 2024 redirected visitors to VexTrio via LosPollos smartlinks</em>.<span id="more-69927"></span></p>
<h2>ADSPRO AND TEKNOLOGY</h2>
<p>On November 14, 2024, Qurium <a href="https://www.qurium.org/forensics/when-kehr-meets-vextrio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published research</a> to support its findings that LosPollos and TacoLoco were services operated by <strong>Adspro Group</strong>, a company registered in the Czech Republic and Russia, and that Adspro runs its infrastructure at the Swiss hosting providers <strong>C41</strong> and <strong>Teknology SA</strong>.</p>
<p>Qurium noted the LosPollos and TacoLoco sites state that their content is copyrighted by <strong>ByteCore AG</strong> and <strong>SkyForge Digital AG</strong>, both Swiss firms that are run by the owner of Teknology SA, <strong>Guilio Vitorrio Leonardo Cerutti</strong>. Further investigation revealed LosPollos and TacoLoco were apps developed by a company called <strong>Holacode</strong>, which lists Cerutti as its CEO.</p>
<p>The apps marketed by Holacode include numerous VPN services, as well as one called <strong>Spamshield</strong> that claims to stop unwanted push notifications. But in January, Infoblox said they tested the app on their own mobile devices, and found it hides the user’s notifications, and then after 24 hours stops hiding them and demands payment. Spamshield subsequently changed its developer name from Holacode to <strong>ApLabz</strong>, although Infoblox noted that the Terms of Service for several of the rebranded ApLabz apps still referenced Holacode in their terms of service.</p>
<p>Incredibly, Cerutti threatened to sue me for defamation before I’d even uttered his name or sent him a request for comment (Cerutti sent the unsolicited legal threat back in January after his company and my name were merely tagged in an Infoblox post on LinkedIn about VexTrio).</p>
<p>Asked to comment on the findings by Qurium and Infoblox, Cerutti vehemently denied being associated with VexTrio. Cerutti asserted that his companies all strictly adhere to the regulations of the countries in which they operate, and that they have been completely transparent about all of their operations.</p>
<p>“We are a group operating in the advertising and marketing space, with an affiliate network program,” Cerutti responded. “I am not [going] to say we are perfect, but I strongly declare we have no connection with VexTrio at all.”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, as a big player in this space we also get to deal with plenty of publisher fraud, sketchy traffic, fake clicks, bots, hacked, listed and resold publisher accounts, etc, etc.,” Cerutti continued. “We bleed lots of money to such malpractices and conduct regular internal screenings and audits in a constant battle to remove bad traffic sources. It is also a highly competitive space, where some upstarts will often play dirty against more established mainstream players like us.”</p>
<p>Working with Qurium, researchers at the security firm <strong>Infoblox</strong> released details about VexTrio’s infrastructure to their industry partners. Just four days after Qurium published its findings, LosPollos announced it was suspending its push monetization service. Less than a month later, Adspro had rebranded to <strong>Aimed Global</strong>.</p>

<h2>A REVEALING PIVOT</h2>
<p>In March 2025, researchers at GoDaddy <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/resources/news/dollyway-malware-c2-tds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chronicled</a> how <strong>DollyWay</strong> — a malware strain that has consistently redirected victims to VexTrio throughout its eight years of activity — suddenly stopped doing that on November 20, 2024. Virtually overnight, DollyWay and several other malware families that had previously used VexTrio began pushing their traffic through another TDS called <strong>Help TDS</strong>.</p>
<p>Digging further into historical DNS records and the unique code scripts used by the Help TDS, Infoblox determined it has long enjoyed an exclusive relationship with VexTrio (at least until LosPollos ended its push monetization service in November).</p>
<p>In <a href="https://blogs.infoblox.com/threat-intelligence/vexing-and-vicious-the-eerie-relationship-between-wordpress-hackers-and-an-adtech-cabal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a report released today</a>, Infoblox said an exhaustive analysis of the JavaScript code, website lures, smartlinks and DNS patterns used by VexTrio and Help TDS linked them with at least four other TDS operators (not counting TacoLoco). Those four entities — <strong>Partners House</strong>, <strong>BroPush</strong>, <strong>RichAds</strong> and <strong>RexPush</strong> — are all Russia-based push monetization programs that pay affiliates to drive signups for a variety of schemes, but mostly online dating services.</p>
<p>“As Los Pollos push monetization ended, we’ve seen an increase in fake CAPTCHAs that drive user acceptance of push notifications, particularly from Partners House,” the Infoblox report reads. “The relationship of these commercial entities remains a mystery; while they are certainly long-time partners redirecting traffic to one another, and they all have a Russian nexus, there is no overt common ownership.”</p>
<p><strong>Renee Burton</strong>, vice president of threat intelligence at Infoblox, said the security industry generally treats the deceptive methods used by VexTrio and other malicious TDSs as a kind of legally grey area that is mostly associated with less dangerous security threats, such as adware and scareware.</p>
<p>But Burton argues that this view is myopic, and helps perpetuate a dark adtech industry that also pushes plenty of straight-up malware, noting that hundreds of thousands of compromised websites around the world every year redirect victims to the tangled web of VexTrio and VexTrio-affiliate TDSs.</p>
<p>“These TDSs are a nefarious threat, because they’re the ones you can connect to the delivery of things like information stealers and scams that cost consumers billions of dollars a year,” Burton said. “From a larger strategic perspective, my takeaway is that Russian organized crime has control of malicious adtech, and these are just some of the many groups involved.”</p>
<h2>WHAT CAN YOU DO?</h2>
<p>As KrebsOnSecurity <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/11/be-very-sparing-in-allowing-site-notifications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warned way back in 2020</a>, it’s a good idea to be very sparing in approving notifications when browsing the Web. In many cases these notifications are benign, but as we’ve seen there are numerous dodgy firms that are paying site owners to install their notification scripts, and then reselling that communications pathway to scammers and online hucksters.</p>
<p>If you’d like to prevent sites from ever presenting notification requests, all of the major browser makers let you do this — either across the board or on a per-website basis. While it is true that blocking notifications entirely can break the functionality of some websites, doing this for any devices you manage on behalf of your less tech-savvy friends or family members might end up saving everyone a lot of headache down the road.</p>
<p>To modify site notification settings in <strong>Mozilla Firefox</strong>, navigate to Settings, Privacy &amp; Security, Permissions, and click the “Settings” tab next to “Notifications.” That page will display any notifications already permitted and allow you to edit or delete any entries. Tick the box next to “Block new requests asking to allow notifications” to stop them altogether.</p>

<p>In <strong>Google Chrome</strong>, click the icon with the three dots to the right of the address bar, scroll all the way down to Settings, Privacy and Security, Site Settings, and Notifications. Select the “Don’t allow sites to send notifications” button if you want to banish notification requests forever.</p>

<p>In Apple’s <strong>Safari </strong>browser, go to Settings, Websites, and click on Notifications in the sidebar. Uncheck the option to “allow websites to ask for permission to send notifications” if you wish to turn off notification requests entirely.</p>

Padilla interrupted the news conference after Noem delivered a particularly pointed line, saying federal authorities were not going away but planned to stay and increase operations to “liberate” the city from its “socialist” leadership.</p>
    
<p>“I’m Sen. Alex Padilla. I have questions for the secretary,” he shouted in a halting voice.</p><div data-align-center="">

    <p>Sound of California Senator Alex Padilla speaking over Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem during a news conference.</p>
    
</div><p>The shocking scene of a U.S. senator being aggressively removed from a Cabinet secretary’s news conference prompted immediate outrage from his Democratic colleagues. Images and video of the scuffle ricocheted through the halls of Congress, where stunned Democrats demanded an immediate investigation and characterized the episode as another in a line of mounting threats to democracy by President Donald Trump’s administration.</p>



<p>Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said what he saw “sickened my stomach.”</p>
    
    
    
<p>“We need immediate answers to what the hell went on,” the New York senator said from the Senate floor. “It’s despicable, it’s disgusting, it’s so un-American.”</p><p>In a statement, DHS said that Padilla “chose disrespectful political theater” and that Secret Service “thought he was an attacker.” The statement claimed erroneously that Padilla did not identify himself — he did, as he was being pushed from the room.</p>
    
<p>“Padilla was told repeatedly to back away and did not comply with officers’ repeated commands,” the statement said, adding that “officers acted appropriately.”</p><p>The fracas in Los Angeles came just days after Democratic U.S. Rep.

In a <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-gavin-newsom-california-immigration-protests-a6467fcd3fa66c945ac7c15c40362972">speech</a></span> earlier this week, the governor warned that “democracy is under assault before our eyes.”</p><p>Emerging afterward, Padilla said he was removed while demanding answers about the Trump administration’s “increasingly extreme immigration enforcement actions.” He said he and his colleagues had received little to no response to their questions in recent weeks, so he attended the briefing for more information.</p>
    
<p>“If this is how this administration responds to a senator with a question … I can only imagine what they are doing to farmworkers, to cooks, to day laborers throughout the Los Angeles community, and throughout California and throughout the country,” he said.</p><div data-align-center="">

<p>Padilla, the son of immigrants from Mexico, has been a harsh Trump critic and his mass deportations agenda. In a social media post, he said of recent federal immigration raids in Los Angeles, “Trump isn’t targeting criminals in his mass deportation agenda, he is terrorizing communities, breaking apart families and putting American citizens in harm’s way.”</p><div data-align-center="">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="content-wrapper">
          

<p>Moving electricity around the world has huge financial and environmental benefits.   Unfortunately, current power transmission systems are both lossy and expensive to build.   This post explores an alternative design for cables to make undersea power transmission substantially cheaper.</p>

<h2 id="idea">Idea</h2>

<p>Fused silica (glass) is a really good insulator (500 MV/m, vs 150 MV/mm for XLPE plastic), and is very cheap.   By using it as cable insulation, cables can be made substantially thinner and cheaper.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, glass isn’t known for its ability to bend, which introduces logistical challenges.    I propose these be solved by manufacturing the cable onboard a boat in a continuous process and directly laying it.</p>

<p>The cable would consist of an aluminium conductor surrounded by a silica insulator.   There would be no outer protection - instead, the silica would be surface hardened, rather like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Rupert%27s_drop">prince ruperts drop</a>.     The extreme internal tensions should be sufficient to allow the cable to be laid on the ocean floor and span lengthy crevasses without breaking, removing the need to bury the cable - more costs saved.</p>

<h2 id="what-voltage">What voltage??</h2>

<p>HVDC cable voltages are chosen to trade off the cost of the conductor (thicker=more amps!) with the cost of the insulator (thicker=more volts!).</p>

<p>Assume that we want our cable to transmit 10 Gigawatts across the Atlantic ocean - which would make it on par with the biggest existing links.  Do <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pwr18v2juYgfpGX553o18YlmazdwxXBZic9R5rKAo9w/edit?usp=sharing">a bit of math</a>, and it turns out 14 megavolts is the sweet spot.    That’s way higher than existing projects (typically 0.5 megavolts), but inverters based on MOSFETs scale with cost proportional to power (one can just stack the mosfets and <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7468138">optically control them</a>), so this shouldn’t matter.</p>

<p>The convertor stations could use air as an insulator (you need 5 meters of dry air on all sides), but it might be better to do the whole thing in transformer oil (500mm on all sides), and/or encase the circuits in moulded silica glass (25mm case thickness, but you’re going to have to be very careful with joint design).</p>

<h2 id="manufacturing">Manufacturing</h2>

<p>The cable manufacturing itself requires new techniques to be developed.    One approach is to have a ~1800C continuously fed furnace with silica, and continuously extrude a slab.   The slab is then curled into a ‘U’ shape, and molten aluminium is poured into the U.  The U is then sealed at the top.   All shaping is done by steel dies which are cooled by water or air boundary layers (like an air hockey table).   The cable is then quenched in water to surface harden it, before it moves out of the back of the ship and falls to the ocean floor over a length of many kilometers (due to very low curve radius).</p>

<h2 id="logistics">Logistics</h2>

<p>Cable manufacture would occur at a constant speed of perhaps 2 kilometers per hour - crossing the Atlantic in 4 months.</p>

<p>To build this cable, 80 mm diameter, at a sluggish walking pace, would require a massive 40,000 tons of sand (silicon dioxide), so it probably makes sense to resupply the manufacturing ship every ~week whilst it is producing, allowing a smaller ‘furnace’ boat to be used.</p>

<h3 id="laying-process">Laying process</h3>

<p>Once the cable comes out of the back of the ship, it will not have sufficient tensile strength to get to the bottom of the deepest oceans (6 kilometers!).  This can be solved by large buoys attached to rollers on the cable spaced every 50 meters or so behind the ship.  The rollers can be regulated entirely passively, since lowering a heavy object requires no energy.</p>

<h2 id="storms">Storms</h2>

<h3 id="waves">Waves</h3>
<p>Typical mid-ocean wave heights are 5+ meters.    As the boat rises and falls in the ocean, it will be necessary for the cable, attached to the boat, to rise and fall too.    This will exert large tensile forces in the cable.   If the cable cannot survive those forces, the whole manufacturing system must be kept at constant height despite the ship rising and falling, which adds significant complexity and cost.</p>

<p>Glass ovens are made of fairly delicate zircon bricks, and building a kiln that can be at 2000C whilst also surviving sloshing molten glass at sea could be a real challenge.</p>

<h3 id="pitch-roll-yaw">Pitch, Roll, Yaw</h3>
<p>The final stages of the manufacturing system cannot pitch, roll or yaw during deployment otherwise the cable will be formed with bends, which will dramatically weaken it.    This might be resolved by choosing a boat with an active stabilization system,  but it’s also possible to stabilize just the manufacturing equipment, and/or to use the cable itself as a reaction torque for stabilization.</p>

<h2 id="cable-strength">Cable strength</h2>
<p>Prince Rupert’s drops appear to only fail when the exterior reaches a zero tension state (rather like prestressed concrete).  With <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=prince+ruperts+drop+internal+pressure">pressures of 700MPa possible</a>, we can calculate that a span with an 80mm cable can go 64 meters before failure.    It’s possible that this could be further with chemical hardening.   Choose the route such that no crevasses of more than 64 meters happen.</p>

<p>One can get an intuitive sense for this in a scale model by laying a bare fiberoptic across a floor.  Whilst a fiberoptic is fragile to bending, one would not expect it to break by simply being laid across a lumpy floor, with spans perhaps thousands of times the diameter.</p>

<h2 id="economics">Economics</h2>
<p>The energy+material cost (which normally is the main cost for undersea cables) of this cable is a mere $5M, and it can supply power for ~20 million homes from the far side of the ocean.  Laying it requires running a custom ship for 4 months with a glass factory onboard.  The scale of the glass factory is similar to existing land-based factories, with possible simplifications because there is no need to mould beer bottles or have loading bays for outgoing product.    A crew of perhaps 30 people could supervise the factory, onboard a converted 5000 TEU container ship. Ship operating cost= $80k/day, plus $20k/day for the glass factory operating costs.  Add 10 days either end for starting/stopping too.</p>

<p>Capital cost of the ship modifications: Similar size glass factories cost around $100M, so assuming a 5 year lifespan, $60k/day for the factory capital cost.</p>

<p>Total cost for installed trans-atlantic cable = $23M.   Which is insanely cheap compared to other cables.    Obviously you can’t have one cable for that price - R&amp;D costs will dwarf this until such cables become common.</p>

<p>The converter stations, grid connections, landing spot and political considerations will dominate the cost, but those are all independent of the distance and not analyzed here - but be reassured that if cables could be laid this cheaply, almost all connections make sense to build.</p>

<h2 id="failuresrepair">Failures/repair</h2>

<h2 id="humans">Humans</h2>
<p>The cable, if snagged by a ship anchor, would catastrophically fail.   Not only would it snap, but the internal stresses would <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVSw2jvYTMw">propagate the crack along the entire length</a>.</p>

<p>While there are various approaches to preventing crack propagation and repairing the cable, the best option is likely to simply install spare cables with slightly differing routes.</p>

<h2 id="geological-movements">Geological movements</h2>
<p>The cable is really un-stretchy.    That means it must be laid in a very slightly wiggling path on the seafloor to absorb a few feet of ground movements (continental drift, earthquakes, etc)</p>

<h2 id="erosion">Erosion</h2>
<p>The prince Rupert’s drop surface is super hard, so abrasion even from fast flowing sand will be slow.   There could also be chemical weathering, but the ocean is saturated already with silicon ions, so I doubt weathering will be fast.</p>

<h2 id="electrical-protection">Electrical protection</h2>
<p>14 megavolt fuses, switches and protection systems do not currently exist.   The cheapest approach is probably to allow the cable itself to be sacrificed in this case, and design the converter stations carefully to minimize the chances of that happening.    For inspections and maintenance, the converter stations and cable would all be taken offline together, with disconnects on the AC side.   This means there is no need to make the converter rooms human-safe whilst energised.</p>

<h2 id="open-questions">Open questions</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>How pure does the silica need to be to get these high insulation properties?
The cost goes up fairly dramatically if the insulator isn’t as good as wikipedia suggests…   Various sources have wildly different figures.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Will it be strong enough to be tensioned across a rocky outcrop and not crack?
The surface of the cable will be harder than nearly every rock in the ocean (except diamond), so it should crush rocks before cracking itself.  Long spans of hanging cable can be avoided by surveying the route first and avoiding such formations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are there better materials - other ceramics or glasses?
The key thing is a material that is cheap, decent insulating properties, does not need a slow crystal growth phase, and which can be strengthened easily with the ‘prince ruperts drop’ effect, or some other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemically_strengthened_glass">chemical strengthening</a> approach.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is a prototype feasible?
It appears washing-machine sized continuous glass furnaces are available for <a href="https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/1200C-1400-1600-1800-Degree-Continuous_10000025754570.html">sub $3k</a>.  Aluminium can also be melted and piped in steel pipes <a href="https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Melting-Furnace-10kg-100kg-Scraps-Iron_10000014057267.html">at hobby scale</a>.  This plus a small boat rental could lead to the first laid cable.    By choosing a smaller diameter the glass is more flexible, making laying easier, and lower voltages can be used for a demo.    Lay a cable a few miles out to sea and demonstrate it doesn’t immediately fail (ie. hook it up to a van-de-graff generator and verify operational voltage) would show the principle is sound at least.  Maintaining a constant diameter for both the core and insulation would likely need computerized feedback system, but even adjusting gates by hand should end up with something approximately cable-shaped.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-next">What next?</h2>

<p>Unless someone <a href="https://omattos.com/contact">drops me an email</a> with a lot of enthusiasm or an offer of money to some R&amp;D and build a pilot, this project is probably parked for now - it’s way out of my ‘self fund for fun’ budget!</p>

Similarly, we all used to believe that making people log in frequently was good security. If authentication is good, then surely more authentication is better, right? Like taking vitamins — one a day is good, so twenty must be great! Except, well, that’s not how anything works.</p><p>Security isn’t about how often you log in. It’s about how well your access is managed in the first place, how fast we can react to policy changes on your account, and how confident we are that your key hasn't been leaked since the last auth. The good news? You can get strong security guarantees without making users miserable.</p><h2 id="what-are-we-really-checking"><a href="#what-are-we-really-checking">What are we really checking?<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2><p>Authentication usually boils down to one of two things:</p><ol><li><strong>Are you still in physical possession of the device?</strong> (For example, Windows Hello PINs, YubiKeys, or smart cards; tests which anyone physically present can likely pass.)</li><li><strong>Are you the right person?</strong> (Passwords, Face ID, Touch ID — things that supposedly nobody but you can replicate, but which don't prove you're physically near a given device.)</li></ol><p>Identity providers (IdPs) focus mostly on <strong>who you are</strong>, since their whole job is identity verification. If they require a YubiKey, they might also check device possession, but that’s not really their main gig.</p><p>Integrated authentication <em>systems</em> like Apple’s Face ID and Touch ID, and tools like Windows Hello, are interesting because they do <strong>both</strong> at once. They're amazing as long as they are <a target="" rel="noreferrer" href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20190114">securely enrolled</a> and their keys are held in a highly trusted, malware resistant, TPM.</p><p>So why do frequent re-logins exist? Usually, it's because admins aren't confident that changes will take effect immediately. Sometimes, especially with SAML, an IdP is configured to send policy attributes to apps only during the user-interactive login process, which means they can't update without a new login.

Now that most OSes can unlock with just a fingerprint or face, there's no reason to leave your screen unlocked when you walk away.</p><h3 id="2-use-continuous-verification-not-frequent-logins"><a href="#2-use-continuous-verification-not-frequent-logins">2. Use continuous verification, not frequent logins<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h3><p>Security should be continuous, not tied to arbitrary interactive cycles. Instead of nagging users, tools like <a target="" rel="noreferrer" href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1288/device-posture">device posture checks</a> and <a target="" rel="noreferrer" href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1290/user-group-provisioning">SCIM-based access control</a> can update security attributes and policies in real time, in the background, without users doing anything. That means you can have updated policies within seconds or minutes; you don't have to compromise between short reauth times (super annoying) and longer ones (less protection).</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li>If your device goes offline, is marked lost, or fails a security check, access gets revoked <strong>instantly</strong>.</li><li>If your role or employment status changes, your access updates <strong>automatically</strong>.</li></ul><p>This approach is <strong>smarter and more secure</strong> than making users re-enter their credentials over and over.</p><h2 id="the-best-security-is-security-without-frustration"><a href="#the-best-security-is-security-without-frustration">The best security is security without frustration<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2><p>Frequent logins aren’t making you safer. They’re just annoying you into worse security habits (like password reuse, clicking phishing links, and MFA fatigue). The best security happens <strong>quietly in the background</strong>, ensuring safety without getting in the way.</p><p>At Tailscale, we believe in security that’s <strong>adaptive, intelligent, and actually useful </strong>— not just security theater. Instead of forcing pointless logins, we make sure authentication happens at the right moments, with as little friction as possible. If you use Tailscale to access your other apps, through <a target="" rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/tree/main/cmd/tsidp">tsidp </a>or <a target="" rel="noreferrer" href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1342/how-app-connectors-work">App Connector</a>, our real-time security checks can flow through to all your other login sessions as well. Even in legacy apps that don't understand SCIM or device posture.</p><p>(Want to go deeper? I wrote <a target="" rel="noreferrer" href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20190114">Factors in authentication</a> some time ago, but the principles still stand. It offers a deeper dive into authentication models and why Tailscale does things the way it does. Because security should be <strong>smart, not frustrating</strong>.)</p></div></div>]]></description>
