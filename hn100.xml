<p dir="auto">According to Chrome's own <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RC-pBBvsazYfCNNUSkPqAVpSpNJ96U8trhNkfV0v9fk/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.83o2xr8ayal6" rel="nofollow">Blink principles of web compatibility</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">The primary signal we use is the fraction of page views impacted in Chrome, usually computed via Blink’s UseCounter UMA metrics.  As a general rule of thumb, 0.1% of PageVisits (1 in 1000) is large, while 0.001% is considered small but non-trivial.  Anything below about 0.00001% (1 in 10 million) is generally considered trivial.  There are around 771 billion web pages viewed in Chrome every month (not counting other Chromium-based browsers).  So seriously breaking even 0.0001% still results in someone being frustrated every 3 seconds, and so not to be taken lightly!</p>

  <h3 id="pr8.0">August 23nd, 2025, FFmpeg 8.0 <span title="David A. Huffman">"Huffman"</span></h3>
  <p>
  A new major release, <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#release_8.0">FFmpeg 8.0 <span title="David A. Huffman">"Huffman"</span></a>,
  is now available for download.
  Thanks to several delays, and modernization of our entire infrastructure, this release ended up
  being one of our largest releases to date. In short, its new features are:
  </p><ul>
    <li>Native decoders: <span title="Advanced Professional Video">APV</span>, ProRes RAW, RealVideo 6.0, Sanyo LD-ADPCM, G.728</li>
    <li>VVC decoder improvements: <span title="Intra Block Copy">IBC</span>,
                                  <span title="Adaptive Color Transform">ACT</span>,
                                  Palette Mode</li>
    <li>Vulkan compute-based codecs: FFv1 (encode and decode), ProRes RAW (decode only)</li>
    <li>Hardware accelerated decoding: Vulkan VP9, VAAPI VVC, OpenHarmony H264/5</li>
    <li>Hardware accelerated encoding: Vulkan AV1, OpenHarmony H264/5</li>
    <li>Formats: MCC, G.728, Whip, APV</li>
    <li>Filters: colordetect, pad_cuda, scale_d3d11, Whisper, and others</li>
  </ul>
  

  <p>
  A new class of decoders and encoders based on pure Vulkan compute implementation have been added.
  Vulkan is a cross-platform, open standard set of APIs that allows programs to use GPU hardware in various ways,
  from drawing on screen, to doing calculations, to decoding video via custom hardware accelerators.
  Rather than using a custom hardware accelerator present, these codecs are based on compute shaders, and work
  on any implementation of Vulkan 1.3.<br>
  Decoders use the same hwaccel API and commands, so users do not need to do anything special to enable them,
  as enabling <a href="https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/HWAccelIntro#Vulkan">Vulkan decoding</a> is sufficient to use them.<br>
  Encoders, like our hardware accelerated encoders, require specifying a new encoder (ffv1_vulkan).
  Currently, the only codecs supported are: FFv1 (encoding and decoding) and ProRes RAW (decode only).
  ProRes (encode+decode) and VC-2 (encode+decode) implementations are complete and currently in review,
  to be merged soon and available with the next minor release.<br>
  Only codecs specifically designed for parallelized decoding can be implemented in such a way, with
  more mainstream codecs not being planned for support.<br>
  Depending on the hardware, these new codecs can provide very significant speedups, and open up
  possibilities to work with them for situations like non-linear video editors and
  lossless screen recording/streaming, so we are excited to learn what our downstream users can make with them.
  </p>

  <p>
  The project has recently started to modernize its infrastructure. Our mailing list servers have been
  fully upgraded, and we have recently started to accept contributions via a new forge, available on
  <a href="https://code.ffmpeg.org/">code.ffmpeg.org</a>, running a Forgejo instance.
  </p>

  <p>
    As usual, we recommend that users, distributors, and system integrators to upgrade unless they use current git master.
  </p>

  <h3 id="pr7.1">September 30th, 2024, FFmpeg 7.1 <span title="Rózsa Péter">"Péter"</span></h3>
  <p>
    <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#release_7.1">FFmpeg 7.1 "Péter"</a>, a new
    major release, is now available! A full list of changes can be found in the release
    <a href="https://git.ffmpeg.org/gitweb/ffmpeg.git/blob/refs/heads/release/7.1:/Changelog">changelog</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The more important highlights of the release are that the VVC decoder, merged as experimental in version 7.0,
    has had enough time to mature and be optimized enough to be declared as stable. The codec is starting to gain
    traction with broadcast standardization bodies.<br>
    Support has been added for a native AAC USAC (part of the xHE-AAC coding system) decoder, with the format starting
    to be adopted by streaming websites, due to its extensive volume normalization metadata.<br>
    MV-HEVC decoding is now supported. This is a stereoscopic coding tool that begun to be shipped and generated
    by recent phones and VR headsets.<br>
    LC-EVC decoding, an enhancement metadata layer to attempt to improve the quality of codecs, is now supported via an
    external library.<br>
  </p>
  <p>
    Support for Vulkan encoding, with H264 and HEVC was merged. This finally allows fully Vulkan-based decode-filter-encode
    pipelines, by having a sink for Vulkan frames, other than downloading or displaying them. The encoders have feature-parity
    with their VAAPI implementation counterparts. Khronos has announced that support for AV1 encoding is also coming soon to Vulkan,
    and FFmpeg is aiming to have day-one support.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to the above, this release has had a lot of important internal work done. By far, the standout internally
    are the improvements made for full-range images. Previously, color range data had two paths, no negotiation,
    and was unreliably forwarded to filters, encoders, muxers. Work on cleaning the system up started more than 10
    years ago, however this stalled due to how fragile the system was, and that breaking behaviour would be unacceptable.
    The new system fixes this, so now color range is forwarded correctly and consistently everywhere needed, and also
    laid the path for more advanced forms of negotiation.<br>
    Cropping metadata is now supported with Matroska and MP4 formats. This metadata is important not only for archival,
    but also with AV1, as hardware encoders require its signalling due to the codec not natively supporting one.
  </p>
  <p>
    As usual, we recommend that users, distributors, and system integrators to upgrade unless they use current git master.
  </p>

  <h3 id="coverity">September 11th, 2024, Coverity</h3>
  <p>
  The number of issues FFmpeg has in <a href="https://scan.coverity.com/projects/ffmpeg">Coverity (a static analyzer)</a> is now lower than it has been since 2016.
  Our defect density is less than one 30th of the average in OSS with over a million code
  lines. All this was possible thanks to a grant from the <a href="https://www.sovereigntechfund.de/">Sovereign Tech Fund</a>.
  </p>
  <p><img src="https://ffmpeg.org/img/coverity-lifetime-2024-08.PNG" alt="Coverity Lifetime Graph till 2024-08"></p><h3 id="xheaac">June 2nd, 2024, native xHE-AAC decoder</h3>
  <p>
  FFmpeg now implements a native xHE-AAC decoder. Currently, streams without (e)SBR, USAC or MPEG-H Surround
  are supported, which means the majority of xHE-AAC streams in use should work. Support for USAC and (e)SBR is
  coming soon. Work is also ongoing to improve its stability and compatibility.
  During the process we found several specification issues, which were then submitted back to the authors
  for discussion and potential inclusion in a future errata.
  </p>

  <h3 id="stf24">May 13th, 2024, Sovereign Tech Fund</h3>
  <p>
  The FFmpeg community is excited to announce that Germany's
  <a href="https://www.sovereigntechfund.de/tech/ffmpeg">Sovereign Tech Fund</a>
  has become its first governmental sponsor. Their support will help
  sustain the maintainance of the FFmpeg project, a critical open-source
  software multimedia component essential to bringing audio and video to
  billions around the world everyday.
  </p>

  <h3 id="pr7.0">April 5th, 2024, FFmpeg 7.0 "Dijkstra"</h3>
  <p>
  A new major release, <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#release_7.0">FFmpeg 7.0 "Dijkstra"</a>,
  is now available for download. The most noteworthy changes for most users are
  a <a href="#vvcdec">native VVC decoder</a> (currently experimental, until more
  fuzzing is done), <a href="#iamf">IAMF support</a>, or a
  <a href="#cli_threading">multi-threaded <code>ffmpeg</code> CLI tool</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  This release is <em>not</em> backwards compatible, removing APIs deprecated before 6.0.
  The biggest change for most library callers will be the removal of the old bitmask-based
  channel layout API, replaced by the <code>AVChannelLayout</code> API allowing such
  features as custom channel ordering, or Ambisonics. Certain deprecated <code>ffmpeg</code>
  CLI options were also removed, and a C11-compliant compiler is now required to build
  the code.
  </p>

  <p>
  As usual, there is also a number of new supported formats and codecs, new filters, APIs,
  and countless smaller features and bugfixes. Compared to 6.1, the <code>git</code> repository
  contains almost ∼2000 new commits by ∼100 authors, touching &gt;100000 lines in
  ∼2000 files — thanks to everyone who contributed. See the
  <a href="https://git.videolan.org/?p=ffmpeg.git;a=blob_plain;f=Changelog;hb=n7.0">Changelog</a>,
  <a href="https://git.videolan.org/?p=ffmpeg.git;a=blob_plain;f=doc/APIchanges;hb=n7.0">APIchanges</a>,
  and the git log for more comprehensive lists of changes.
  </p>

  <h3 id="vvcdec">January 3rd, 2024, native VVC decoder</h3>
  <p>
  The <code>libavcodec</code> library now contains a native VVC (Versatile Video Coding)
  decoder, supporting a large subset of the codec's features. Further optimizations and
  support for more features are coming soon. The code was written by Nuo Mi, Xu Mu,
  Frank Plowman, Shaun Loo, and Wu Jianhua.
  </p>

  <h3 id="iamf">December 18th, 2023, IAMF support</h3>
  <p>
  The <code>libavformat</code> library can now read and write <a href="https://aomediacodec.github.io/iamf/">IAMF</a>
  (Immersive Audio) files. The <code>ffmpeg</code> CLI tool can configure IAMF structure with the new
  <code>-stream_group</code> option. IAMF support was written by James Almer.
  </p>

  <h3 id="cli_threading">December 12th, 2023, multi-threaded <code>ffmpeg</code> CLI tool</h3>
  <p>
  Thanks to a major refactoring of the <code>ffmpeg</code> command-line tool, all the major
  components of the transcoding pipeline (demuxers, decoders, filters, encodes, muxers) now
  run in parallel. This should improve throughput and CPU utilization, decrease latency,
  and open the way to other exciting new features.
  </p>

  <p>
  Note that you should <em>not</em> expect significant performance improvements in cases
  where almost all computational time is spent in a single component (typically video
  encoding).
  </p>

  <h3 id="pr6.1">November 10th, 2023, FFmpeg 6.1 "Heaviside"</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#release_6.1">FFmpeg 6.1 "Heaviside"</a>, a new
    major release, is now available! Some of the highlights:

  <p>
    This release had been overdue for at least half a year, but due to constant activity in the repository,
    had to be delayed, and we were finally able to branch off the release recently, before some of the large
    changes scheduled for 7.0 were merged.
  </p>
  <p>
    Internally, we have had a number of changes too. The FFT, MDCT, DCT and DST implementation used for codecs
    and filters has been fully replaced with the faster libavutil/tx (full article about it coming soon).<br>
    This also led to a reduction in the the size of the compiled binary, which can be noticeable in small builds.<br>
    There was a very large reduction in the total amount of allocations being done on each frame throughout video decoders,
    reducing overhead.<br>
    RISC-V optimizations for many parts of our DSP code have been merged, with mainly the large decoders being left.<br>
    There was an effort to improve the correctness of timestamps and frame durations of each packet, increasing the
    accurracy of variable frame rate video.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next major release will be version 7.0, scheduled to be released in February. We will attempt to better stick
    to the new release schedule we announced at the start of this year.
  </p>
  <p>
    We strongly recommend users, distributors, and system integrators to upgrade unless they use current git master.

  <h3 id="vk2023">May 31st, 2023, Vulkan decoding</h3>
  <p>
    A few days ago, Vulkan-powered decoding hardware acceleration code was merged into the codebase.
    This is the first vendor-generic and platform-generic decode acceleration API, enabling the
    same code to be used on multiple platforms, with very minimal overhead.
    This is also the first multi-threaded hardware decoding API, and our code makes full use of this,
    saturating all available decode engines the hardware exposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Those wishing to test the code can read our
    <a href="https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/HWAccelIntro#Vulkan">documentation page</a>.
    For those who would like to integrate FFmpeg's Vulkan code to demux, parse, decode, and receive
    a VkImage to present or manipulate, documentation and examples are available in our source tree.
    Currently, using the latest available git checkout of our
    <a href="https://git.videolan.org/?p=ffmpeg.git;a=summary">repository</a> is required.
    The functionality will be included in stable branches with the release of version 6.1, due
    to be released soon.
  </p>
  <p>
    As this is also the first practical implementation of the specifications, bugs may be present,
    particularly in drivers, and, although passing verification, the implementation itself.
    New codecs, and encoding support are also being worked on, by both the Khronos organization
    for standardizing, and us as implementing it, and giving feedback on improving.
  </p>

  <h3 id="pr6.0">February 28th, 2023, FFmpeg 6.0 "Von Neumann"</h3>
  <p>
    A new major release, <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#release_6.0">FFmpeg 6.0 "Von Neumann"</a>,
    is now available for download. This release has many new encoders and decoders, filters,
    ffmpeg CLI tool improvements, and also, changes the way releases are done. All major
    releases will now bump the version of the ABI. We plan to have a new major release each
    year. Another release-specific change is that deprecated APIs will be removed after 3
    releases, upon the next major bump.
    This means that releases will be done more often and will be more organized.
  </p>
  <p>
    New decoders featured are Bonk, RKA, Radiance, SC-4, APAC, VQC, WavArc and a few ADPCM formats.
    QSV and NVenc now support AV1 encoding. The FFmpeg CLI (we usually reffer to it as ffmpeg.c
    to avoid confusion) has speed-up improvements due to threading, as well as statistics options,
    and the ability to pass option values for filters from a file. There are quite a few new audio
    and video filters, such as adrc, showcwt, backgroundkey and ssim360, with a few hardware ones too.
    Finally, the release features many behind-the-scenes changes, including a new FFT and MDCT
    implementation used in codecs (expect a blog post about this soon), numerous bugfixes, better
    ICC profile handling and colorspace signalling improvement, introduction of a number of RISC-V
    vector and scalar assembly optimized routines, and a few new improved APIs, which can be viewed
    in the doc/APIchanges file in our tree.
    A few submitted features, such as the Vulkan improvements and more FFT optimizations will be in the
    next minor release, 6.1, which we plan to release soon, in line with our new release schedule.

  <h3 id="photosensitivity">October 5th, 2019, Bright Lights</h3>
  <p>
  FFmpeg has added a realtime bright flash removal filter to libavfilter.
  </p>
  <p>
  Note that this filter is not FDA approved, nor are we medical professionals.
  Nor has this filter been tested with anyone who has photosensitive epilepsy.
  FFmpeg and its photosensitivity filter are not making any medical claims.
  </p>
  <p>
  That said, this is a new video filter that may help photosensitive people
  watch tv, play video games or even be used with a VR headset to block
  out epiletic triggers such as filtered sunlight when they are outside.
  Or you could use it against those annoying white flashes on your tv screen.
  The filter fails on some input, such as the
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L_9hXnUzRk">Incredibles 2 Screen Slaver</a>
  scene. It is not perfect. If you have other clips that you want this filter to
  work better on, please report them to us on our <a href="http://trac.ffmpeg.org/">trac</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  <a href="http://ffmpeg.org/~compn/output20p8.mp4">See for yourself</a>.
  Example was made with -vf photosensitivity=20:0.8
  </p>
  <p>
  We are not professionals. Please use this in your medical studies to
  advance epilepsy research. If you decide to use this in a medical
  setting, or make a hardware hdmi input output realtime tv filter,
  or find another use for this, <a href="mailto:compn@ffmpeg.org">please let me know</a>.
  This filter was a feature request of mine
  <a href="https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/2104">since 2013</a>.

  <h3 id="gsoc2016finalreport">October 30th, 2016, Results: Summer Of Code 2016.</h3>
  <p>
    This has been a long time coming but we wanted to give a proper closure to our participation in this run of the program and it takes time. Sometimes it's just to get the final report for each project trimmed down, others, is finalizing whatever was still in progress when the program finished: final patches need to be merged, TODO lists stabilized, future plans agreed; you name it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Without further ado, here's the silver-lining for each one of the projects we sought to complete during this Summer of Code season:
  </p>
  <h4>FFv1 (Mentor: Michael Niedermayer)</h4>
  <p>
    Stanislav Dolganov designed and implemented experimental support for motion estimation and compensation in the lossless FFV1 codec. The design and implementation is based on the snow video codec, which uses OBMC. Stanislav's work proved that significant compression gains can be achieved with inter frame compression. FFmpeg welcomes Stanislav to continue working beyond this proof of concept and bring its advances into the official FFV1 specification within the IETF.
  </p>
  <h4>Self test coverage (Mentor: Michael Niedermayer)</h4>
  <p>
    Petru Rares Sincraian added several self-tests to FFmpeg and successfully went through the in-some-cases tedious process of fine tuning tests parameters to avoid known and hard to avoid problems, like checksum mismatches due to rounding errors on the myriad of platforms we support. His work has improved the code coverage of our self tests considerably.
  </p>
  <h4>MPEG-4 ALS encoder implementation (Mentor: Thilo Borgmann)</h4>
  <p>
    Umair Khan updated and integrated the ALS encoder to fit in the current FFmpeg codebase. He also implemented a missing feature for the ALS decoder that enables floating-point sample decoding. FFmpeg support for MPEG-4 ALS has been improved significantly by Umair's work. We welcome him to keep maintaining his improvements and hope for great contributions to come.
  </p>
  <h4>Tee muxer improvements (Mentor: Marton Balint)</h4>
  <p>
    Ján Sebechlebský's generic goal was to improve the tee muxer so it tolerated blocking IO and allowed transparent error recovery. During the design phase it turned out that this functionality called for a separate muxer, so Ján spent his summer working on the so-called FIFO muxer, gradually fixing issues all over the codebase. He succeeded in his task, and the FIFO muxer is now part of the main repository, alongside several other improvements he made in the process.
  </p>
  <h4>TrueHD encoder (Mentor: Rostislav Pehlivanov)</h4>
  <p>
    Jai Luthra's objective was to update the out-of-tree and pretty much abandoned MLP (Meridian Lossless Packing) encoder for libavcodec and improve it to enable encoding to the TrueHD format. For the qualification period the encoder was updated such that it was usable and throughout the summer, successfully improved adding support for multi-channel audio and TrueHD encoding. Jai's code has been merged into the main repository now. While a few problems remain with respect to LFE channel and 32 bit sample handling, these are in the process of being fixed such that effort can be finally put in improving the encoder's speed and efficiency.
  </p>
  <h4>Motion interpolation filter (Mentor: Paul B Mahol)</h4>
  <p>
    Davinder Singh investigated existing motion estimation and interpolation approaches from the available literature and previous work by our own: Michael Niedermayer, and implemented filters based on this research. These filters allow motion interpolating frame rate conversion to be applied to a video, for example, to create a slow motion effect or change the frame rate while smoothly interpolating the video along the motion vectors. There's still work to be done to call these filters 'finished', which is rather hard all things considered, but we are looking optimistically at their future.
  </p>
  <p>
    And that's it. We are happy with the results of the program and immensely thankful for the opportunity of working with such an amazing set of students. We can be a tough crowd but our mentors did an amazing job at hand holding our interns through their journey. Thanks also to Google for this wonderful program and to everyone that made room in their busy lives to help making GSoC2016 a success. See you in 2017!
  </p>
  <h3 id="sdl1">September 24th, 2016, SDL1 support dropped.</h3>
  <p>
    Support for the SDL1 library has been dropped, due to it no longer being maintained (as of
    January, 2012) and it being superseded by the SDL2 library. As a result, the SDL1 output device
    has also been removed and replaced by an SDL2 implementation. Both the ffplay and opengl output
    devices have been updated to support SDL2.
  </p>
  <h3 id="pr3.1.2">August 9th, 2016, FFmpeg 3.1.2 "Laplace"</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#release_3.1">FFmpeg 3.1.2</a>, a new point release from the 3.1 release branch, is now available!
    It fixes several bugs.
  </p>
  <p>
    We recommend users, distributors, and system integrators, to upgrade unless they use current git master.
  </p>
  <h3 id="ffserv">July 10th, 2016, ffserver program being dropped</h3>
  <p>
    After thorough deliberation, we're announcing that we're about to drop the ffserver program from the project starting with the next release.
    ffserver has been a problematic program to maintain due to its use of internal APIs, which complicated the recent cleanups to the libavformat
    library, and block further cleanups and improvements which are desired by API users and will be easier to maintain. Furthermore the program has
    been hard for users to deploy and run due to reliability issues, lack of knowledgable people to help and confusing configuration file syntax.
    Current users and members of the community are invited to write a replacement program to fill the same niche that ffserver did using the new APIs
    and to contact us so we may point users to test and contribute to its development.
  </p>
  <h3 id="pr3.1.1">July 1st, 2016, FFmpeg 3.1.1 "Laplace"</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#release_3.1">FFmpeg 3.1.1</a>, a new point release from the 3.1 release branch, is now available!
    It mainly deals with a few ABI issues introduced in the previous release.

  <p>
    We strongly recommend users, distributors, and system integrators, especially those who experienced issues upgrading from 3.0, to
    upgrade unless they use current git master.

  <h3 id="removing_external_aac_encoders">January 30, 2016, Removing support for two external AAC encoders</h3>
  <p>
    We have just removed support for VisualOn AAC encoder (libvo-aacenc) and
    libaacplus in FFmpeg master.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even before marking our internal AAC encoder as
    <a href="#aac_encoder_stable">stable</a>, it was known that libvo-aacenc
    was of an inferior quality compared to our native one for most samples.
    However, the VisualOn encoder was used extensively by the Android Open
    Source Project, and we would like to have a tested-and-true stable option
    in our code base.
  </p>
  <p>
    When first committed in 2011, libaacplus filled in the gap of encoding
    High Efficiency AAC formats (HE-AAC and HE-AACv2), which was not supported
    by any of the encoders in FFmpeg at that time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The circumstances for both have changed. After the work spearheaded by
    Rostislav Pehlivanov and Claudio Freire, the now-stable FFmpeg native AAC
    encoder is ready to compete with much more mature encoders. The Fraunhofer
    FDK AAC Codec Library for Android was added in 2012 as the fourth
    supported external AAC encoder, and the one with the best quality and the
    most features supported, including HE-AAC and HE-AACv2.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, we have decided that it is time to remove libvo-aacenc and
    libaacplus. If you are currently using libvo-aacenc, prepare to transition
    to the native encoder (<code>aac</code>) when updating to the next version
    of FFmpeg. In most cases it is as simple as merely swapping the encoder
    name. If you are currently using libaacplus, start using FDK AAC
    (<code>libfdk_aac</code>) with an appropriate <code>profile</code> option
    to select the exact AAC profile that fits your needs. In both cases, you
    will enjoy an audible quality improvement and as well as fewer licensing
    headaches.
  </p>
  <p>
    Enjoy!

  <h3 id="aac_encoder_stable">December 5th, 2015, The native FFmpeg AAC encoder is now stable!</h3>
  <p>
    After seven years the native FFmpeg AAC encoder has had its experimental flag
    removed and declared as ready for general use. The encoder is transparent
    at 128kbps for most samples tested with artifacts only appearing in extreme
    cases. Subjective quality tests put the encoder to be of equal or greater
    quality than most of the other encoders available to the public.
  </p>
  <p>
    Licensing has always been an issue with encoding AAC audio as most of the
    encoders have had a license making FFmpeg unredistributable if compiled with
    support for them. The fact that there now exists a fully open and truly
    free AAC encoder integrated directly within the project means a lot to those
    who wish to use accepted and widespread standards.
  </p>
  <p>
    The majority of the work done to bring the encoder up to quality was started
    during this year's GSoC by developer Claudio Freire and Rostislav Pehlivanov.
    Both continued to work on the encoder with the latter joining as a developer
    and mainainer, working on other parts of the project as well. Also, thanks
    to <a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/kamedo2/">Kamedo2</a> who does comparisons
    and tests, the original authors and all past and current contributors to the
    encoder. Users are suggested and encouraged to use the encoder and provide
    feedback or breakage reports through our <a href="https://trac.ffmpeg.org/">bug tracker</a>.

  <h3 id="gsoc2015_result">September 29th, 2015, GSoC 2015 results</h3>

  <p>
    FFmpeg participated to the latest edition of
    the <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015">Google
    Summer of Code</a> Project. FFmpeg got a total of 8 assigned
    projects, and 7 of them were successful.
  </p>

  <p>We want to thank <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>, the
    participating students, and especially the mentors who joined this
    effort. We're looking forward to participating in the next GSoC
    edition!
  </p>

  <p>
    Below you can find a brief description of the final outcome of
    each single project.
  </p>

  <h4>Basic servers for network protocols, mentee: Stephan Holljes, mentor: Nicolas George</h4>

  <p>
    Stephan Holljes's project for this session of Google Summer of Code was to
    implement basic HTTP server features for libavformat, to complement the
    already present HTTP client and RTMP and RTSP server code.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first part of the project was to make the HTTP code capable of accepting
    a single client; it was completed partly during the qualification period and
    partly during the first week of the summer. Thanks to this work, it is now
    possible to make a simple HTTP stream using the following commands:
  </p>

  <pre>    ffmpeg -i /dev/video0 -listen 1 -f matroska \
    -c:v libx264 -preset fast -tune zerolatency http://:8080
    ffplay http://localhost:8080/
  </pre>

  <p>
    The next part of the project was to extend the code to be able to accept
    several clients, simultaneously or consecutively. Since libavformat did not
    have an API for that kind of task, it was necessary to design one. This part
    was mostly completed before the midterm and applied shortly afterwards.
    Since the ffmpeg command-line tool is not ready to serve several clients,
    the test ground for that new API is an example program serving hard-coded
    content.
  </p>

  <p>
    The last and most ambitious part of the project was to update ffserver to
    make use of the new API. It would prove that the API is usable to implement
    real HTTP servers, and expose the points where more control was needed. By
    the end of the summer, a first working patch series was undergoing code
    review.
  </p>

  <h4>Browsing content on the server, mentee: Mariusz Szczepańczyk, mentor: Lukasz Marek</h4>

  <p>
    Mariusz finished an API prepared by the FFmpeg community and implemented
    Samba directory listing as qualification task.
  </p>

  <p>
    During the program he extended the API with the possibility to
    remove and rename files on remote servers. He completed the
    implementation of these features for file, Samba, SFTP, and FTP
    protocols.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the end of the program, Mariusz provided a sketch of an
    implementation for HTTP directory listening.
  </p>

  <h4>Directshow digital video capture, mentee: Mate Sebok, mentor: Roger Pack</h4>

  <p>
    Mate was working on directshow input from digital video sources. He
    got working input from ATSC input sources, with specifiable tuner.
  </p>

  <p>
    The code has not been committed, but a patch of it was sent to the
    ffmpeg-devel mailing list for future use.
  </p>

  <p>
    The mentor plans on cleaning it up and committing it, at least for the
    ATSC side of things. Mate and the mentor are still working trying to
    finally figure out how to get DVB working.
  </p>

  <h4>Implementing full support for 3GPP Timed Text Subtitles, mentee: Niklesh Lalwani, mentor: Philip Langdale</h4>

  <p>
    Niklesh's project was to expand our support for 3GPP Timed Text
    subtitles. This is the native subtitle format for mp4 containers, and
    is interesting because it's usually the only subtitle format supported
    by the stock playback applications on iOS and Android devices.
  </p>

  <p>
    ffmpeg already had basic support for these subtitles which ignored all
    formatting information - it just provided basic plain-text support.
  </p>

  <p>
    Niklesh did work to add support on both the encode and decode side for
    text formatting capabilities, such as font size/colour and effects like
    bold/italics, highlighting, etc.
  </p>

  <p>
    The main challenge here is that Timed Text handles formatting in a very
    different way from most common subtitle formats. It uses a binary
    encoding (based on mp4 boxes, naturally) and stores information
    separately from the text itself. This requires additional work to track
    which parts of the text formatting applies to, and explicitly dealing
    with overlapping formatting (which other formats support but Timed
    Text does not) so it requires breaking the overlapping sections into
    separate non-overlapping ones with different formatting.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, Niklesh had to be careful about not trusting any size
    information in the subtitles - and that's no joke: the now infamous
    Android stagefright bug was in code for parsing Timed Text subtitles.
  </p>

  <p>
    All of Niklesh's work is committed and was released in ffmpeg 2.8.
  </p>

<h4>libswscale refactoring, mentee: Pedro Arthur, mentors: Michael Niedermayer, Ramiro Polla</h4>

  <p>
    Pedro Arthur has modularized the vertical and horizontal scalers.
    To do this he designed and implemented a generic filter framework
    and moved the existing scaler code into it. These changes now allow
    easily adding removing, splitting or merging processing steps.
    The implementation was benchmarked and several alternatives were
    tried to avoid speed loss.
  </p>

  <p>
    He also added gamma corrected scaling support.
    An example to use gamma corrected scaling would be:
  </p>

  <pre>    ffmpeg -i input -vf scale=512:384:gamma=1 output
  </pre>

  <p>
    Pedro has done impressive work considering the short time available,
    and he is a FFmpeg committer now. He continues to contribute to
    FFmpeg, and has fixed some bugs in libswscale after GSoC has
    ended.
  </p>

  <h4>AAC Encoder Improvements, mentee: Rostislav Pehlivanov, mentor: Claudio Freire</h4>

  <p>
    Rostislav Pehlivanov has implemented PNS, TNS, I/S coding and main
    prediction on the native AAC encoder. Of all those extensions, only
    TNS was left in a less-than-usable state, but the implementation has
    been pushed (disabled) anyway since it's a good basis for further
    improvements.
  </p>

  <p>
    PNS replaces noisy bands with a single scalefactor representing the
    energy of that band, gaining in coding efficiency considerably, and
    the quality improvements on low bitrates are impressive for such a
    simple feature.
  </p>

  <p>
    TNS still needs some polishing, but has the potential to reduce coding
    artifacts by applying noise shaping in the temporal domain (something
    that is a source of annoying, notable distortion on low-entropy
    bands).
  </p>

  <p>
    Intensity Stereo coding (I/S) can double coding efficiency by
    exploiting strong correlation between stereo channels, most effective
    on pop-style tracks that employ panned mixing. The technique is not as
    effective on classic X-Y recordings though.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, main prediction improves coding efficiency by exploiting
    correlation among successive frames. While the gains have not been
    huge at this point, Rostislav has remained active even after the GSoC,
    and is polishing both TNS and main prediction, as well as looking for
    further improvements to make.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the process, the MIPS port of the encoder was broken a few times,
    something he's also working to fix.
  </p>

  <h4>Animated Portable Network Graphics (APNG), mentee: Donny Yang, mentor: Paul B Mahol</h4>

  <p>
    Donny Yang implemented basic keyframe only APNG encoder as the
    qualification task. Later he wrote interframe compression via
    various blend modes. The current implementation tries all blend
    modes and picks one which takes the smallest amount of memory.
  </p>

  <p>
    Special care was taken to make sure that the decoder plays
    correctly all files found in the wild and that the encoder
    produces files that can be played in browsers that support APNG.
  </p>

  <p>
    During his work he was tasked to fix any encountered bug in the
    decoder due to the fact that it doesn't match APNG
    specifications. Thanks to this work, a long standing bug in the
    PNG decoder has been fixed.
  </p>

  <p>
    For latter work he plans to continue working on the encoder,
    making it possible to select which blend modes will be used in the
    encoding process. This could speed up encoding of APNG files.
  </p>

  <h3 id="message">August 1st, 2015, A message from the FFmpeg project</h3>
  <p>
    Dear multimedia community,
  </p>
  <p>
    The resignation of Michael Niedermayer as leader of FFmpeg yesterday has
    come by surprise. He has worked tirelessly on the FFmpeg project for many
    years and we must thank him for the work that he has done. We hope that in
    the future he will continue to contribute to the project. In the coming
    weeks, the FFmpeg project will be managed by the active contributors.
  </p>
  <p>
    The last four years have not been easy for our multimedia community - both
    contributors and users. We should now look to the future, try to find
    solutions to these issues, and to have reconciliation between the forks,
    which have split the community for so long.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, much of the disagreement has taken place in inappropriate
    venues so far, which has made finding common ground and solutions
    difficult. We aim to discuss this in our communities online over the coming
    weeks, and in person at the <a href="https://www.videolan.org/videolan/events/vdd15/">VideoLAN Developer
    Days</a> in Paris in September: a neutral venue for the entire open source
    multimedia community.
  </p>
  <p>
    The FFmpeg project.
  </p>

  <h3 id="opw03">October 8, 2014, FFmpeg secured a place in OPW!</h3>
  <p>
    Thanks to a generous 6K USD donation by Samsung (Open Source Group),
    FFmpeg will be welcoming at least 1 "Outreach Program for Women" intern
    to work with our community for an initial period starting December 2014
    (through March 2015).
  </p>

  <p>
    We all know FFmpeg is used by the industry, but even while there are
    countless products building on our code, it is not at all common for
    companies to step up and help us out when needed. So a big thank-you
    to Samsung and the OPW program committee!
  </p>

  <h3 id="heartbleed">April 18, 2014, OpenSSL Heartbeat bug</h3>
  <p>
    Our server hosting the Trac issue tracker was vulnerable to the attack
    against OpenSSL known as "heartbleed". The OpenSSL software library
    was updated on 7th of April, shortly after the vulnerability was publicly
    disclosed. We have changed the private keys (and certificates) for all
    FFmpeg servers. The details were sent to the mailing lists by
    Alexander Strasser, who is part of the project server team. Here is a
    link to the user mailing list
    <a href="https://lists.ffmpeg.org/pipermail/ffmpeg-user/2014-April/020968.html">archive</a>
    .
  </p><p>
    We encourage you to read up on
    <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/04/heartbleed.html">"OpenSSL heartbleed"</a>.
    <b>It is possible that login data for the issue tracker was exposed to
      people exploiting this security hole. You might want to change your password
      in the tracker and everywhere else you used that same password.</b>

  <h3 id="trac_sec">February 9, 2014, trac.ffmpeg.org / trac.mplayerhq.hu Security Breach</h3>
  <p>
    The server on which FFmpeg and MPlayer Trac issue trackers were
    installed was compromised. The affected server was taken offline
    and has been replaced and all software reinstalled.
    FFmpeg Git, releases, FATE, web and mailinglists are on other servers
    and were not affected. We believe that the original compromise happened
    to a server, unrelated to FFmpeg and MPlayer, several months ago.
    That server was used as a source to clone the VM that we recently moved
    Trac to. It is not known if anyone used the backdoor that was found.
  </p>
  <p>
    We recommend all users to change their passwords.
    <b>Especially users who use a password on Trac that they also use
      elsewhere, should change that password at least elsewhere.</b>
  </p>


  <h3 id="ffmpeg_rfp">November 12, 2013, FFmpeg RFP in Debian</h3>
  <p>
    Since the splitting of Libav the Debian/Ubuntu maintainers have followed
    the Libav fork. Many people have requested the packaging of ffmpeg in
    Debian, as it is more feature-complete and in many cases less buggy.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="http://cynic.cc/blog/">Rogério Brito</a>, a Debian developer,
    has proposed a Request For Package (RFP) in the Debian bug tracking
    system.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please let the Debian and Ubuntu developers know that you support packaging
    of the real FFmpeg! See Debian <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=729203">ticket #729203</a>
    for more details.
  </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“There is a crack in everything. That’s how the light gets in.”</em> — Leonard Cohen</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Let me tell you something that will happen after you become a manager: you’re going to mess up. A lot. You’ll give feedback that lands wrong and crushes someone’s confidence. You’ll make a decision that seems logical but turns out to be completely misguided. You’ll forget that important thing you promised to do for someone on your team. You’ll lose your temper in a meeting when you should have stayed calm.</p>



<p>The real question isn’t whether you’ll make mistakes; it’s what you do <em>after</em>.</p>



<p>I recently read&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Good-Inside-Guide-Becoming-Parent/dp/B09PGMSBBN">“Good Inside”</a></em>&nbsp;by Dr. Becky Kennedy, a parenting book that completely changed how I think about this. She talks about how the most important parenting skill isn’t being perfect — it’s&nbsp;<strong>repair</strong>. When you inevitably lose your patience with your kid or handle something poorly, what matters most is going back and fixing it. <strong>Acknowledging what happened, taking responsibility, and reconnecting.</strong></p>



<p>Sound familiar? Because that’s what good management is about too.</p>



<p>Think about the worst manager you ever had. I bet they weren’t necessarily the ones who made the most mistakes. But they were probably the ones who never acknowledged them. Who doubled down when they were wrong. Who let their ego prevent them from admitting they didn’t have all the answers.</p>



<p>Here’s a pattern I see play out constantly: A manager commits to something without consulting the team. Maybe it’s a feature at a client demo, a timeline in a board meeting, or just a “small favor” for another department. The team scrambles to deliver, working nights and weekends. They make it happen, but barely, and with real costs: technical debt, burned-out engineers, resentment building.</p>



<p>What happens next determines everything. The manager who never acknowledges what they put the team through? That’s how you lose your best people. But the manager who comes back and says, <em>“I put you in an impossible position. I should have consulted you first. I’m sorry for the stress that caused, and here’s how I’ll handle it differently next time”</em>, that manager builds trust even through the mistake.</p>



<p>I’ve been on both sides of this. As an engineer, I watched managers make the same mistakes over and over again, never acknowledging the chaos they created. As a manager, I’ve been the one creating that chaos 🥲. The difference in outcomes is massive; when you own your mistakes completely and specifically, something unexpected happens: your team trusts you more, not less.</p>



<p>Here’s what repair looks like in practice:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Be specific about what you did wrong.</strong>&nbsp;Not “mistakes were made” or “things could have gone better.” But “I interrupted you three times in that meeting and dismissed your concerns. That was wrong.”</li>



<li><strong>Don’t make it about you.</strong>&nbsp;This isn’t the time for a long explanation of your stress levels or why you acted that way. Save that for your therapist or your own manager. The repair is about acknowledging the impact on the other person.</li>



<li><strong>Actually change the behavior.</strong>&nbsp;An apology without changed behavior is just empty words. If you keep making the same “mistake,” it’s not a mistake anymore; it’s a choice.</li>



<li><strong>Give it time.</strong>&nbsp;One conversation doesn’t instantly repair broken trust. It’s a starting point, not a finish line. You have to consistently show up differently.</li>
</ol>



<p><strong>The beautiful thing about getting comfortable with repair is that it actually makes you better as a manager</strong>. When you know you can fix things when they go wrong, you’re more willing to make decisions, have difficult conversations, and take reasonable risks. You stop being paralyzed by perfectionism because you know that most mistakes, while serious, create opportunities for growth and stronger relationships when handled well.</p>



<p>This doesn’t mean being reckless or careless. It doesn’t mean making the same mistakes repeatedly. And it definitely doesn’t mean using repair as a get-out-of-jail-free card for being a shitty manager.</p>



<p>What it means is accepting that you’re human, that management is complex, and that you won’t always get it right. Your job isn’t to be perfect. Your job is to&nbsp;<a href="https://terriblesoftware.org/2025/06/13/good-engineer-bad-engineer/">ship working software that adds real value to users</a>, to help your team grow, and to create an environment where people can do their best work. </p>



<p>Sometimes you’ll fail at those things. When you do, you repair, you learn, and you keep going.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">


  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Previous posts <a href="https://blog.habets.se/2013/10/Why-Go-is-not-my-favourite-language.html">Why Go is not my favourite language</a> and <a href="https://blog.habets.se/2022/02/Go-programs-are-not-portable.html">Go programs
are not portable</a> have me critiquing Go for over a decade.</p>

<p>These things about Go are bugging me more and more. Mostly because they’re so
unnecessary. The world knew better, and yet Go was created the way it was.</p>

<p>For readers of previous posts you’ll find some things repeated here. Sorry
about that.</p>

<h2 id="error-variable-scope-is-forced-to-be-wrong">Error variable scope is forced to be wrong</h2>

<p>Here’s an example of the language forcing you to do the wrong thing. It’s very
helpful for the reader of code (and code is read more often than it’s written),
to minimize the scope of a variable. If by mere syntax you can tell the reader
that a variable is just used in these two lines, then that’s a good thing.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>if</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>foo</span><span>();</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>!=</span><span> </span><span>nil</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
   </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
</div>

<p>(enough has been said about this verbose repeated boilerplate that I don’t have
to. I also don’t particularly care)</p>

<p>So that’s fine. The reader knows <code>err</code> is here and only here.</p>

<p>But then you encounter this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>bar</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>foo</span><span>()</span><span>
</span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>!=</span><span> </span><span>nil</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>foo2</span><span>();</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>!=</span><span> </span><span>nil</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>[</span><span>…</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span> </span><span>lot</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> </span><span>code</span><span> </span><span>below</span><span> </span><span>…</span><span>]</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
</div>

<p>Wait, what? Why is <code>err</code> reused for <code>foo2()</code>? Is there’s something subtle I’m
not seeing? Even if we change that to <code>:=</code>, we’re left to wonder why <code>err</code> is
in scope for (potentially) the rest of the function. Why? Is it read later?</p>

<p>Especially when looking for bugs, an experienced coder will see these things
and slow down, because here be dragons. Ok, now I’ve wasted a couple of seconds
on the red herring of reusing <code>err</code> for <code>foo2()</code>.</p>

<p>Is a bug perhaps that the function ends with this?</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// Return foo99() error. (oops, that's not what we're doing)</span><span>
</span><span>foo99</span><span>()</span><span>
</span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>// This is `err` from way up there in the foo() call.</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
</div>

<p>Why does the scope of <code>err</code> extend way beyond where it’s relevant?</p>

<p>The code would have been so much easier to read if only <code>err</code>’s scope had been
smaller. But that’s not syntactically possible in Go.</p>

<p>This was not thought through. Deciding on this was not thinking, it was typing.</p>

<h2 id="two-types-of-nil">Two types of nil</h2>

<p>Look at this nonsense:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>package</span><span> </span><span>main</span><span>
</span><span>import</span><span> </span><span>"fmt"</span><span>
</span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>I</span><span> </span><span>interface</span><span>{}</span><span>

    </span><span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>// nil nil</span><span>
    </span><span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span> </span><span>==</span><span> </span><span>nil</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span> </span><span>==</span><span> </span><span>nil</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>s</span><span> </span><span>==</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>// t,f,t: They are not equal, but they are.</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
</div>

<p>Go was not satisfied with one <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Hoare/">billion dollar
mistake</a>,
so they decided to have <strong>two</strong> flavors of <code>NULL</code>.</p>

<p>“What color is your nil?” — The two billion dollar mistake.</p>

<p>The reason for the difference boils down to again, not thinking, just typing.</p>

<h2 id="its-not-portable">It’s not portable</h2>

<p>Adding comment near the top of the file for conditional compilation must be the
dumbest thing ever. Anybody who’s actually tried to maintain a portable program
will tell you this will only cause suffering.</p>

<p>It’s an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelian_physics">Aristotle way of the science</a> of designing a language; lock
yourself up in a room, and never test your hypotheses against reality.</p>

<p>The problem is that this is not year 350 BCE. We actually have experience that
aside from air resistance, heavy and light objects actually fall at the same
speed. And we have experience with portable programs, and would not do
something this dumb.</p>

<p>If this had been the year 350 BCE, then this could be forgiven. Science as we
know it hadn’t been invented yet. But this is after decades of very widely
available experience in portability.</p>

<p>If you guessed <code>[hello world !]</code>, then you know more than anybody should have
to know about quirks of a stupid programming language.</p>

<h2 id="defer-is-dumb"><code>defer</code> is dumb</h2>

<p>Even in a GC language, sometimes you just can’t wait to destroy a resource. It
really does need to run as we leave the local code, be it by normal return, or
via an exception (aka panic).</p>

<p>What we clearly want is RAII, or something like it.</p>

<p>Java has it:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>try</span> <span>(</span><span>MyResource</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>MyResource</span><span>())</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>/*
  work with resource r, which will be cleaned up when the scope ends via
  .close(), not merely when the GC feels like it.
  */</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Python has it. Though Python is <em>almost</em> entirely refcounted, so one can pretty
much rely on the <code>__del__</code> finalizer being called. But if it’s important, then
there’s the <code>with</code> syntax.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>with</span> <span>MyResource</span><span>()</span> <span>as</span> <span>res</span><span>:</span>
  <span># some code. At end of the block __exit__ will be called on res.</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Go? Go makes you go read the manual and see if this particular resource needs
to have a defer function called on it, and which one.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>foo</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>myResource</span><span>()</span><span>
</span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>!=</span><span> </span><span>nil</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>defer</span><span> </span><span>foo</span><span>.</span><span>Close</span><span>()</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
</div>

<p>This is so dumb. Some resources need a defer destroy. Some don’t. Which ones?
Good fucking luck.</p>

<p>And you also regularly end up with stuff like this monstrosity:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>f</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>openFile</span><span>()</span><span>
</span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>!=</span><span> </span><span>nil</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>nil</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>defer</span><span> </span><span>f</span><span>.</span><span>Close</span><span>()</span><span>
</span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>f</span><span>.</span><span>Write</span><span>(</span><span>something</span><span>());</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>!=</span><span> </span><span>nil</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>nil</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>:=</span><span> </span><span>f</span><span>.</span><span>Close</span><span>();</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span> </span><span>!=</span><span> </span><span>nil</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>nil</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>err</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
</div>

<p>Yes, this is what you NEED to do to safely write something to a file in Go.</p>

<p>What’s this, a <em>second</em> <code>Close()</code>? Oh yeah, of course that’s needed. Is it even
safe to double-close, or does my defer need to check for that? It happens to be
safe on <code>os.File</code>, but on other things: WHO KNOWS?!</p>

<h2 id="the-standard-library-swallows-exceptions-so-all-hope-is-lost">The standard library swallows exceptions, so all hope is lost</h2>

<p>(Largely a repeat of part of <a href="https://blog.habets.se/2013/10/Why-Go-is-not-my-favourite-language.html">a previous post</a>)</p>

<p>Go says it doesn’t have exceptions. Go makes it extremely awkward to use
exceptions, because they want to punish programmers who use them.</p>

<p>Ok, fine so far.</p>

<p>But all Go programmers must still write exception safe code. Because while
<em>they</em> don’t use exceptions, other code will. Things will panic.</p>

<p>So you need, not should, NEED, to write code like:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>func</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span>Foo</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>foo</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>f</span><span>.</span><span>mutex</span><span>.</span><span>Lock</span><span>()</span><span>
    </span><span>defer</span><span> </span><span>f</span><span>.</span><span>mutex</span><span>.</span><span>Unlock</span><span>()</span><span>
    </span><span>f</span><span>.</span><span>bar</span><span>()</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
</div>

<p>What is this stupid middle endian system? That’s dumb just like putting the day
in the middle of a date is dumb. MMDDYY, honestly? (separate rant)</p>

<p>But panic will terminate the program, they say, so why do you care if you
unlock a mutex five milliseconds before it exits anyway?</p>

<p>Because what if something swallows that exception and carries on as normal, and
you’re now stuck with a locked mutex?</p>

<p>But surely nobody would do that? Reasonable and strict coding standards would
surely prevent it, under penalty of being fired?</p>

<p>The standard library does that. <code>fmt.Print</code> when calling <code>.String()</code>, and the
standard library HTTP server does that, for exceptions in the HTTP handlers.</p>

<p>All hope is lost. You MUST write exception safe code. But you can’t use
exceptions. You can only have the downsides of exceptions be thrust upon you.</p>

<p>Don’t let them gaslight you.</p>

<h2 id="sometimes-things-arent-utf-8">Sometimes things aren’t UTF-8</h2>

<p>If you stuff random binary data into a <code>string</code>, Go just steams along, as
described <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles/i-want-off-mr-golangs-wild-ride">in this post</a>.</p>

<p>Over the decades I have lost data to tools skipping non-UTF-8 filenames. I
should not be blamed for having files that were named before UTF-8 existed.</p>

<p>Well… I had them. They’re gone now. They were silently skipped in a
backup/restore.</p>

<p>Go wants you to continue losing data. Or at least, when you lose data, it’ll
say “well, what (encoding) was the data wearing?”.</p>

<p>Or how about you just do something more thought through, when you design a
language? How about doing the right thing, instead of the obviously wrong
simple thing?</p>

<h2 id="memory-use">Memory use</h2>

<p>Why do I care about memory use? RAM is cheap. Much cheaper than the time it
takes to read this blog post. I care because my service runs on a cloud
instance where you actually pay for RAM. Or you run containers, and you want to
run a thousand of them on the same machine. Your data may <a href="https://yourdatafitsinram.net/">fit in
RAM</a>, but it’s still expensive if you have to
give your thousand containers 4TiB of RAM instead of 1TiB.</p>

<p>You can manually trigger a GC run with <code>runtime.GC()</code>, but “oh no don’t do
that”, they say, “it’ll run when it has to, just trust it”.</p>

<p>Yeah, 90% of the time, that works every time. But then it doesn’t.</p>

<p>I rewrote some stuff in another language because over time the Go version would
use more and more memory.</p>

<h2 id="it-didnt-have-to-be-this-way">It didn’t have to be this way</h2>

<p>We knew better. This was not the COBOL debate over whether to use symbols or
English words.</p>

<p>And it’s not like when we didn’t know at the time that <a href="https://blog.habets.se/2022/08/Java-a-fractal-of-bad-experiments.html">Java’s ideas were
bad</a>, because we did know Go’s ideas were bad.</p>

<p>We already knew better than Go, and yet now we’re stuck with bad Go codebases.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    
    <div>
      <p>What the <em>hell</em> is going on right now?</p>

<p>Engineers are burning out. Orgs expect their senior engineering staff to be able to review and contribute to “vibe-coded” features that don’t work. My personal observation is that the best engineers are highly enthusiastic about helping newer team members contribute and learn.</p>

<p>Instead of their comments being taken to heart, reflected on, and used as learning opportunities, hapless young coders are instead using feedback as simply the next prompt in their “AI” masterpiece. I personally have witnessed and heard first-hand accounts where it was incredibly obvious a junior engineer was (ab)using LLM tools.</p>

<p>In a recent company town-hall, I watched as a team of junior engineers demoed their latest work. I couldn’t tell you what exactly it did, or even what it was supposed to do - it didn’t seem like they themselves understood. However, at a large enough organization, it’s not about what you do, its about what people <em>think</em> you do. Championing their “success”, a senior manager goaded them into bragging about their use of “AI” tools to which they responded “This is four thousand lines of code written by Claude”. Applause all around.</p>

<p>I was asked to add a small improvement to an existing feature. After reviewing the code, I noticed a junior engineer was the most recent to work on that feature. As I always do, I reached out to let them know what I’d be doing and to see if they had any insight that would be useful to me. Armed with the Github commit URL, I asked for context around their recent change. I can’t know <em>for sure</em>, but I’d be willing to put money down that my exact question and the commit were fed directly into an LLM which was then copy and pasted back to me. I’m not sure why, but I felt violated. It felt wrong.</p>

<p>A friend recently confided in me that he’s been on a team of at least 5 others that have been involved in reviewing a heavily vibe-coded PR over the past <em>month</em>. A month. Reviewing slop produced by an LLM. What are the cost savings of paying ChatGPT $20 a month and then having a literal <em>team</em> of engineers try and review and merge the code?</p>

<p>Another friend commiserated the difficulty of trying to help an engineer contribute at work. “I review the code, ask for changes, and then they <em>immediately</em> hit me with another round of AI slop.”</p>

<p>Here’s the thing - we <em>want</em> to help. We <em>want</em> to build good things. Things that work well, that make people’s lives easier. We want to teach people how to do software engineering! Any engineer is standing entirely on the shoulders of their mentors and managers who’ve invested time and energy into them and their careers. But what good is that investment if it’s simply copy-pasted into the latest “model” that “is literally half a step from artificial general intelligence”? Should we instead focus our time and energy into training the models and eliminate the juniors altogether?</p>

<p>What a sad, dark world that would be.</p>

<p>Here’s an experiment for you: stop using “AI”. Try it for a day. For a week. For a month.</p>

<p>Recently, I completely reset my computer. I like to do it from time to time. As part of that process I prune out any software that I no longer use. I’ve been paying for Claude Pro for about 6 months. But slowly, I’ve felt like it’s just a huge waste of time. Even if I have to do a few independent internet searches and read through a few dozen stack overflow and doc pages, my own conclusion is so much more reliable and accurate than anything an LLM could ever spit out.</p>

<p>So what good are these tools? Do they have any value whatsoever?</p>

<p>Objectively, it would seem the answer is no. But at least they make a lot of money, right?</p>

<p>Is anyone making money on AI right now? I see a pipeline that looks like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“AI” is applied to some specific, existing area, and a company spins up around it because it’s so much more “efficient”</li>
  <li>AI company gets funding from venture capitalists</li>
  <li>AI company give funding to AI service providers such as OpenAI in the form of paying for usage credits</li>
  <li>AI company evaporates</li>
</ul>

<p>This isn’t necessarily all that different than the existing VC pipeline, but the difference is that not even OpenAI is making money right now. I believe this is because the technology is inherently flawed and cannot scale to meet the demand. It simply consumes too much electricity to ever be economically viable, not to mention the serious environmental concerns.</p>

<p>We can say our prayers that Moore’s Law will come back from the dead and save us. We can say our prayers that the heat death of the universe will be sufficiently prolonged in order for every human to become a billionaire. We can also take an honestly not even hard look at reality and realize this is a scam.</p>

<p>The emperor is wearing no clothes.</p>

	<h2>But It’s Better that <code>"🤦🏼‍♂️".len() == 17</code> and Rather Useless that <code>len("🤦🏼‍♂️") == 5</code></h2>
</hgroup>
<p>From time to time, someone shows that in JavaScript the <code>.length</code> of a string containing an emoji results in a number greater than 1 (typically 2) and then proceeds to the conclusion that haha JavaScript is so broken—and is rewarded with many likes. In this post, I will try to convince you that ridiculing JavaScript for this is less insightful than it first appears and that Swift’s approach to string length isn’t unambiguously the best one. Python 3’s approach is unambiguously the worst one, though.</p>
<h2>What’s Going on with the Title?</h2>
<p><code>"🤦🏼‍♂️".length == 7</code> evaluates to <code>true</code> as JavaScript. Let’s try JavaScript console in Firefox:</p>
<pre>"🤦🏼‍♂️".length == 7
true</pre>
<p>Haha, right? Well, you’ve been told that the Python community suffered the Python 2 vs. Python 3 split, among other things, to Get Unicode Right. Let’s try Python 3:</p>
<pre>$ python3
Python 3.6.8 (default, Jan 14 2019, 11:02:34) 
[GCC 8.0.1 20180414 (experimental) [trunk revision 259383]] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; len("🤦🏼‍♂️") == 5
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; </pre>
<p>OK, then. Now, Rust has the benefit of learning from languages that came before it. Let’s try Rust:</p>
<pre>$ cargo new -q length
$ cd length
$ echo 'fn main() { println!("{}", "🤦🏼‍♂️".len() == 17); }' &gt; src/main.rs
$ cargo run -q
true
</pre>
<p>That’s better!</p>
<h2>What?</h2>
<p>The string contains a single emoji consisting of five Unicode scalar values:</p>
<table>
	<thead>
		<tr><th>Unicode scalar</th><th>UTF-32 code units</th><th>UTF-16 code units</th><th>UTF-8 code units</th><th>UTF-32 bytes</th><th>UTF-16 bytes</th><th>UTF-8 bytes</th></tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>U+1F926 FACE PALM</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr>
		<tr><td>U+1F3FC EMOJI MODIFIER FITZPATRICK TYPE-3</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr>
		<tr><td>U+200D ZERO WIDTH JOINER</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr>
		<tr><td>U+2642 MALE SIGN</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr>
		<tr><td>U+FE0F VARIATION SELECTOR-16</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr>
	</tbody>
	<tfoot>
		<tr><th>Total</th><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>17</td><td>20</td><td>14</td><td>17</td></tr>
	</tfoot>
</table>
<p>The string that contains one graphical unit consists of 5 Unicode scalar values. First, there’s a base character that means a person face palming. By default, the person would have a cartoonish yellow color. The next character is an emoji skintone modifier the changes the color of the person’s skin (and, in practice, also the color of the person’s hair). By default, the gender of the person is undefined, and e.g. Apple defaults to what they consider a male appearance and e.g. Google defaults to what they consider a female appearance. The next two scalar values pick a male-typical appearance specifically regardless of font and vendor. Instead of being an emoji-specific modifier like the skin tone, the gender specification uses an emoji-predating gender symbol (MALE SIGN) explicitly ligated using the ZERO WIDTH JOINER with the (skin-toned) face-palming person. (Whether it is a good or a bad idea that the skin tone and gender specifications use different mechanisms is out of the scope of this post.) Finally, VARIATION SELECTOR-16 makes it explicit that we want a multicolor emoji rendering instead of a monochrome dingbat rendering.</p>

<p>Each of the languages above reports the string length as the number of <i>code units</i> that the string occupies. Python 3 strings store Unicode code points each of which is stored as one code unit by CPython 3, so the string occupies 5 code units. JavaScript (and Java) strings have (potentially-invalid) UTF-16 semantics, so the string occupies 7 code units. Rust strings are (guaranteed-valid) UTF-8, so the string occupies 17 code units. We’ll come to back to the actual <i>storage</i> as opposed to <i>semantics</i> later.</p>

<p>Note about Python 3 added on 2019-09-09: Originally this article claimed that Python 3 guaranteed UTF-32 validity. This was in error. Python 3 guarantees that the units of the string stay within the Unicode code point range but does not guarantee the absence of surrogates. It not only allows unpaired surrogates, which might be explained by wishing to be compatible with the value space of potentially-invalid UTF-16, but Python 3 allows materializing even surrogate pairs, which is a truly bizarre design. The previous conclusions stand with the added conclusion that Python 3 is even more messed up than I thought! With the way the example string was constructed in Python 3, the Python 3 string happens to match the valid UTF-32 representation of the string, so it is still illustrative of UTF-32, but the rest of the article has been slightly edited to avoid claiming that Python 3 used UTF-32.</p>

<h2>But I Want the Length to Be 1!</h2>

<p>There’s a language for that. The following used Swift 4.2.3, which was the latest release when I was researching this, on Ubuntu 18.04:</p>

<pre>$ mkdir swiftlen
$ cd swiftlen/
$ swift package init -q --type executable
$ swift package init --type executable
Creating executable package: swiftlen
Creating Package.swift
Creating README.md
Creating .gitignore
Creating Sources/
Creating Sources/swiftlen/main.swift
Creating Tests/
Creating Tests/LinuxMain.swift
Creating Tests/swiftlenTests/
Creating Tests/swiftlenTests/swiftlenTests.swift
Creating Tests/swiftlenTests/XCTestManifests.swift
$ echo 'print("🤦🏼‍♂️".count == 1)' &gt; Sources/swiftlen/main.swift 
$ swift run swiftlen 2&gt;/dev/null
true</pre>

<p>(Not using the Swift REPL for the example, because it does not appear to accept non-ASCII input on Ubuntu! Swift 5.0.3 prints the same and the REPL is still broken.)</p>

<p>OK, so we’ve found a language that thinks the string contains one countable unit. But what is that countable unit? It’s an <i>extended grapheme cluster</i>. (“Extended” to distinguish from the older attempt at defining grapheme clusters now called <i>legacy grapheme clusters</i>.) The definition is in <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/">Unicode Standard Annex #29</a> (UAX #29).</p>

<h2>The Lengths Seen So Far</h2>

<p>We’ve seen four different lengths so far:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Number of UTF-8 code units (17 in this case)</li>
	<li>Number of UTF-16 code units (7 in this case)</li>
	<li>Number of UTF-32 code units or Unicode scalar values (5 in this case)</li>
	<li>Number of extended grapheme clusters (1 in this case)</li>
</ul>

<p>Given a valid Unicode string and a version of Unicode, all of the above are well-defined and it holds that each item higher on the list is greater or equal than the items lower on the list.</p>

<p>One of these is not like the others, though: The first three numbers have an unchanging definition for any valid Unicode string whether it contains currently assigned scalar values or whether it is from the future and contains unassigned scalar values as far as software written today is aware. Also, computing the first three lengths does not involve lookups from the Unicode database. However, the last item depends on the Unicode version and involves lookups from the Unicode database. If a string contains scalar values that are unassigned as far as the copy of the Unicode database that the program is using is aware, the program will potentially overcount extended grapheme clusters in the string compared to a program whose copy of the Unicode database is newer and has assignments for those scalar values (and some of those assignments turn out to be combining characters).</p>

<h2>More Than One Length per Programming Language</h2>

<p>It is not the case that a given programming language has to choose only one of the above. If we run this Swift program:</p>

<pre>var s = "🤦🏼‍♂️"
print(s.count)
print(s.unicodeScalars.count)
print(s.utf16.count)
print(s.utf8.count)</pre>

<p>it prints:</p>

<pre>1
5
7
17</pre>

<p>Let’s try Rust with <code>unicode-segmentation = "1.3.0"</code> in <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>

<pre>use unicode_segmentation::UnicodeSegmentation;

fn main() {
	let s = "🤦🏼‍♂️";
	println!("{}", s.graphemes(true).count());
	println!("{}", s.chars().count());
	println!("{}", s.encode_utf16().count());
	println!("{}", s.len());
}</pre>

<p>The above program prints:</p>

<pre>2
5
7
17</pre>

<p>That’s unexpected! It turns out that <code>unicode-segmentation</code> does not implement the latest version of the Unicode segmentation rules, so it gives the ZERO WIDTH JOINER generic treatment (break right after ZWJ) instead of the newer refinement in the emoji context.</p>

<p>Let’s try again, but this time with <code>unic-segment = "0.9.0"</code> in <code>Cargo.toml</code>:

</p><pre>use unic_segment::Graphemes;

fn main() {
	let s = "🤦🏼‍♂️";
	println!("{}", Graphemes::new(s).count());
	println!("{}", s.chars().count());
	println!("{}", s.encode_utf16().count());
	println!("{}", s.len());
}</pre>

<pre>1
5
7
17</pre>

<p>In the Rust case, strings (here mere string slices) know the number of UTF-8 code units they contain. The <code>len()</code> method call just returns this number that has been stored since the creation of the string (in this case, compile time). In the other cases, what happens is the creation of an iterator and then instead of actually examining the values (string slices correspoding to extended grapheme clusters, Unicode scalar values or UTF-16 code units) that the iterator would yield, the <code>count()</code> method just consumes the iterator and returns the number of items that were yielded by the iteration. The count isn’t stored anywhere on the string (slice) afterwards. If we wanted to later know the counts again, we’d have to iterate over the string again.</p>

<h2>Know in Advance or Compute When Needed?</h2>

<p>This introduces a notable question in the design space: Should a given type of length quantity be eagerly computed when the string is created? Or should the length be computed when someone asks for it? Or should it be computed when someone asks for it and then automatically stored on the string object so that it’s available immediately if someone asks for it again?</p>

<p>The answer Rust has is that the length in the code units of the Unicode Encoding Form of the language is stored upon string creation, and the rest are computed when someone asks for them (and then forgotten and not stored on the string).</p>

<p>Swift is a higher-level language and doesn’t document the exact nature of its string internals as part of the API contract. In fact, the internal representation of Swift strings changed substantially between Swift 4.2 and Swift 5.0. It’s not documented if different views to the string are held onto once created, for example. The documentation does say that strings are copy-on-write, so the first mutation may involve copying the string’s storage.</p>

<p>Notably, the design space includes not remembering anything. The C programming language is a prominent example of this case. C strings don’t even remember their number of code units. To find out the number of code units, you have to iterate over the string until a sentinel value. In the case of C, the sentinel is the code unit for U+0000, so it excludes one Unicode scalar value from the possible string contents. However, that’s not a strictly necessary property of a sentinel-based design that doesn’t remember any lengths. 0xFF does not occur as a code unit in any valid UTF-8 string and 0xFFFFFFFF does not occur in any valid UTF-32 string, so they could be used as sentinels for UTF-8 and UTF-32 storage, respectively, without excluding a scalar value from the Unicode value space. There is no 16-bit value that never occurs in a valid UTF-16 string. However, a valid UTF-16 string does not contain unpaired surrogates, so an unpaired low surrogate could, in principle, be used as a sentinel in a design that wanted to use guaranteed-valid UTF-16 strings that don’t remember their code unit length.</p>

<h2>Knowing the Storage-Native Code Unit Length is Extremely Reasonable</h2>

<p>The length of the string as counted in code units of its storage-native Unicode Encoding Form (i.e. whichever of UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF 32 the programming language has chosen for its string semantics) is not like the other lengths. It is the length that the implementation cannot avoid having to know at the time of creating a new string, because it is the length that is required to be known in order to be able to allocate storage for a string. Even C, which promptly forgets about the code unit length in the storage-native Unicode Encoding Form after string has been created, has to know this length when allocating storage for a new string.</p>

<p>That is, the design decision is about whether to remember this length. It is not about whether to compute it eagerly. You just have to have it at string creation time—i.e. eagerly.</p>

<p>Considering that remembering this quantity makes string concatenation, which is a common operation, substantially faster to implement compared to not remembering this quantity, remembering this quantity is fundamentally reasonable. Also, it means that you don’t need to maintain a sentinel value, which means that a substring operation can yield results that share the buffer with the original string instead of having to copy in order to be able to insert sentinel. (Note that you can easily foil this benefit if you wish to eagerly maintain zero-termination for the sake of C string compatibility.)</p>

<h2>What About Knowing the Other Lengths?</h2>

<p>Even if we’ve established that it makes sense for string implementation to remember the storage length of the string in code units all the storage-native Unicode encoding form, it doesn’t answer whether a string implementation should also remember other lengths or which kind of length should be offered in the most ergonomic API. (As we see above, Swift makes the number of extended grapheme clusters more ergonomic to obtain that the code unit or scalar value length.)</p>

<p>Also, if any other length is to be remembered, there is the question of whether it should be eagerly computed as string creation time or lazily computed the first time someone asks for it. It is easy to see why at least the latter does not make sense for multi-threaded systems-programming language like Rust. If some properties of an object are lazily initialized, in a multi-threaded case you also need to solve synchronization of these computations. Furthermore, you need to allocate space at least for a pointer to auxiliary information if you want to be able to add auxiliary information later or you need to have a hashtable of auxiliary information where the string the information is about is the key, so auxiliary information, even when not present, has storage implications or implications of having to have global state in a run-time system. Finally, for systems programming, it may be more desirable to know the time complexity of a given operation clearly even if it means “always O(n)” instead of “possibly O(n) but sometimes O(1)”. Even if the latter looks strictly better, it is less <i>predictable</i>.</p>

<p>For a higher-level language, arguments from space requirements or synchronization issues might not be decisive. It’s more relevant to consider what a given length quantity is <i>used for</i>. This is often forgotten in Internet debates that revolve around what length is the most “correct” or “logical” one. So for the lengths that don’t map to the size of storage allocation, what are they good for?</p>

<p>It turns out that in the Firefox code base there are two places where someone wants to know the number of Unicode scalar values in a string that is not being stored as UTF-32 and attention is not paid to what the scalar values actually are. The IETF specification for Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) used for WebRTC has the curious property that it places length limits on certain protocol strings such that the limits are expressed as number of Unicode scalar values but the strings are transmitted in UTF-8. Firefox validates these limits. (The limit looks like an arbitrary power-of-two (128 scalar values). The spec has remarks about the possible resulting byte length, which was wrong according to the IETF UTF-8 RFC that was current and already nearly five years old at the time of publication of the STUN RFC. Specifically, the STUN RFC repeatedly says that 128 characters as UTF-8 may be as long as 763 bytes. To arrive at that number, you have to assume that a UTF-8 character can be up to six bytes long, as opposed to up to 4 bytes long as in the prevailing UTF-8 RFC and in the Unicode Standard, and that the last character of the 128 is a zero terminator and, therefore, known to take just one byte.) In this case, the reason for wishing to know a non-storage length is to <i>impose a limit</i>. The other case is reporting the column number for the source location of JavaScript errors.</p>

<p>Length limits, which we’ll come back to, probably aren’t a frequent enough a use case to justify making strings know a particular kind of length as opposed to such length being possible to compute when asked for. Neither are error messages.</p>

<p>Another use case for asking for a length is iterating by index and using the length as the loop termination condition 1990s Java style. Like this:</p>

<pre>for (int i = 0; i &lt; s.length(); i++) {
    // Do something with s.charAt(i)
}</pre>

<p>In this case, it’s actually important for the length to be precomputed number on the string object. This use case is coupled with the requirement that indexing into the string to find the <i>n</i>th unit corresponding to the count of units that the “length” represents should be a fast operation.</p>

<p>The above pattern is a lot less conclusive in terms of what lengths should be precomputed (and what the indexing unit should be) than it first appears. The above loop doesn’t do random access by index. It sequentially uses every index from zero up to, but not including, <code>length</code>. Indeed, especially when iterating over a string by Unicode scalar value, typically when you examine the contents of a string, you iterate over the string in order. Programming languages these days provide an <i>iterator</i> facility for this, and e.g. to iterate over a UTF-8 string by scalar value, the iterator does not need to know the number of scalar values up front. E.g. in Rust, you can do this in O(n) time despite string slices not knowing their number of Unicode scalar values:</p>

<pre>for (c in s.chars()) {
    // Do something with c
}</pre>

<p>(Note that <code>char</code> is an 8-bit code unit (possibly UTF-8 code unit) in C and C++, <code>char</code> is a UTF-16 code unit in Java, <code>char</code> is a Unicode scalar value in Rust, and <code>Character</code> is an extended grapheme cluster in Swift.)</p>

<p>A programming language together with its library ecosystem should provide iteration over a string by Unicode scalar value and by extended grapheme cluster, but it does not follow that strings would need to know the scalar value length or the extended grapheme cluster length up front. Unlike the code unit storage length, those quantities aren’t useful for accelerating operations like concatenation that don’t care about the exact content of the string.

</p><h2>Which Unicode Encoding Form Should a Programming Language Choose?</h2>

<p>The observation that having strings know their code unit length in their storage-native Unicode encoding form is extremely reasonable does not answer how many bits wide the code units should be.</p>

<p>The usual way to approach this question is to argue that UTF-32 is the best, because it provides O(1) indexing by “character” in the sense of a character meaning a Unicode scalar value, or the argument focuses on whether UTF-8 is unfair to some languages relative to UTF-16. I think these are bad ways to approach this question.</p>

<p>First of all, the argument that the answer should be UTF-32 is bad on two counts. First, it assumes that random access scalar value is important, but in practice it isn’t. It’s reasonable to want to have a capability to iterate over a string by scalar value, but random access by scalar value is in the YAGNI department. Second, arguments in favor of UTF-32 typically come at a point where the person making the argument has learned about surrogate pairs in UTF-16 but has not yet learned about extended grapheme clusters being even larger things that the user perceives as unit. That is, if you escape the variable-width nature of UTF-16 to UTF-32, you pay by doubling the memory requirements and extended grapheme clusters are <i>still</i> variable-width.</p>

<p>I’ll come back to the length fairness issue later, but I think a different argument is much more relevant <i>in practice</i> for the choice of in-memory Unicode encoding form. The more relevant argument is this: Implementations that choose UTF-8 actually accept the UTF-8 storage requirements. When wider-unit semantics are chosen for a language that doesn’t provide raw memory access and, therefore, has the opportunity to tweak string storage, the implementations try to come up with ways to avoid actually paying the cost of the wider units in some situations.</p>

<p>JavaScript and Java strings have the semantics of potentially-invalid UTF-16. SpiderMonkey and V8 implement an optimization for omitting the leading zeros of each code unit in a string, i.e. storing the string as ISO-8859-1 (the actual ISO-8859-1, not the Web notion of “ISO-8859-1” as a label of windows-1252), when all code units in the string have zeros in the most-significant half. The HotSpot JVM also implements this optimization, though enabling it is optional. Swift 4.2 implements a slightly different variant of the same idea, where ASCII-only strings are stored as 8-bit units and everything else is stored as UTF-16. CPython since 3.3 makes the same idea three-level with code point semantics: Strings are stored with 32-bit code units if at least one code point has a non-zero bit above the low 16 bits. Else if a string has a non-zero bits above the low 8 bits for at least one code point, the string is stored as 16-bit units. Otherwise, the string is stored as 8-bit units (Latin1).</p>

<p>I think the unwillingness of implementations of languages that have chosen UTF-16 or UTF-32 (or UTF-32-ish as in the case of Python 3) string <i>semantics</i> to actually use UTF-16 or UTF-32 <i>storage</i> when they can get away with not using actual UTF-16 or UTF-32 storage is the clearest indictment against UTF-16 or UTF-32 (and other wide-unit semantics like what Python 3 uses).</p>

<p>Languages that choose UTF-8, on the other hand, stick to actual UTF-8 for the purpose of storing Unicode scalar values. When languages that choose UTF-8 deviate from UTF-8, they do so in order to represent values that are not Unicode scalar values for compatibility with external constraints. Rust uses a representation called <a href="https://simonsapin.github.io/wtf-8/">WTF-8</a> for file system paths on Windows. All UTF-8 strings are WTF-8 strings, but WTF-8 can also represent unpaired surrogates for compatibility with Windows file paths being sequences of 16-bit units that can contain unpaired surrogates. Perl 6 uses an internal representation called <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/unicode#UTF8-C8">UTF-8 Clean-8</a> (or UTF8-C8), which represents strings that consist of Unicode scalar values in Unicode Normalization Form C the same way as UTF-8 but represents non-NFC content differently and can represent sequences of bytes that are not valid UTF-8.</p>

<p>UTF-8 is the only one of the Unicode <i>encoding forms</i> that is also a Unicode <i>encoding scheme</i>, and of the Unicode encoding schemes, UTF-8 has clearly won for interchange. (Unicode encoding forms are what you have in RAM, so UTF-16 consists of native-endian, two-byte-aligned 16-bit code units. Unicode encoding schemes are what can be used for byte-oriented interchange, so e.g. UTF-16LE consist of 8-bit code units every pair of which form a potentially-unaligned little-endian 16-bit number, which in turn may form a surrogate pair.) When UTF-8 is used as the in-RAM representation, input and output operations are less expensive than with UTF-16 or UTF-32. UTF-16 or UTF-32 in RAM requires conversion from UTF-8 when reading input and conversion to UTF-8 when writing output. A system that guarantees UTF-8 validity internally, such as Rust, needs only to <i>validate</i> UTF-8 upon reading input and no conversion is needed when writing output. (Go takes a garbage in, garbage out approach to UTF-8: input is not validated at input time and output is written without conversion. However, iteration by scalar value can yield REPLACEMENT CHARACTERs when iterating over invalid UTF-8. That is, the input step is less expensive than in Rust, but iterating by scalar value is marginally more expensive. The output step is less correct.)

</p><p>Finally, in terms of nudging developers to write correct code, UTF-8 has the benefit of being blatantly variable-width, so even with languages such as English, Somali, and Swahili, as soon as you have a dash or a smart quote, the variable-width nature of UTF-8 shows up. In this context, extended grapheme clusters are just extending the variable-width nature. Meanwhile, UTF-16 allows programmers to get too far while pretending to be working with something where the units they need to care about are fixed-width. Reacting to surrogate pairs by wishing to use UTF-32 instead is a bad idea, because if you want to write correct software, you still need to deal with variable-width extended grapheme clusters.

</p><p>The choice of UTF-32 (or Python 3-style code point sequences) arises from wanting the wrong thing. The choice of UTF-16 is a matter of early-adopter legacy from the time when Unicode was expected to be capped to 16 bits of code space and, once UTF-16 has been committed to, not breaking compatibility with already-written programs is important and justified the continued use of UTF-16, but if you aren’t bound by that legacy and are designing a new language, you should go with UTF-8. Occasionally even systems that appear to be bound by the UTF-16 legacy can break free. Even though Swift is committed to interoperability with Cocoa, which uses UTF-16 strings, <a href="https://swift.org/blog/utf8-string/">Swift 5 switched to UTF-8</a> for Swift-native strings. Similarly, <a href="https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2019/03/pypy-v71-released-now-uses-utf-8.html?m=1">PyPy has gone UTF-8</a> despite Python 3 having code point semantics.</p>

<h2>Shouldn’t the Nudge Go All the Way to Extended Grapheme Clusters?</h2>

<p>Even if we accept that the storage should be UTF-8 and that the string implementation should maintain knowledge of the string length in UTF-8 code units, if the blatant variable-widthness of UTF-8 is argued to be a nudge toward dealing with the variable-widthness of extended grapheme clusters, shouldn’t the Swift approach of making extended grapheme cluster access and count the view that takes the least ceremony to use be the thing that every language should do?</p>

<p>Swift is still too young to draw definitive conclusions from. It’s easy to believe that the Swift approach nudges programmers to write more extended grapheme cluster-correct code and that the design makes sense for a language meant primarily for UI programming on a largely evergreen platform (iOS). It isn’t clear, though, that the Swift approach is the best for everyone.</p>

<p>Earlier, I said that the example used “Swift 4.2.3 on Ubuntu 18.04”. The “18.04” part is important! Swift.org ships binaries for Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04, and 18.04. Running the program</p>

<pre>var s = "🤦🏼‍♂️"
print(s.count)
print(s.unicodeScalars.count)
print(s.utf16.count)
print(s.utf8.count)</pre>

<p>in Swift 4.2.3 on Ubuntu 14.04 prints:</p>

<pre>3
5
7
17</pre>

<p>So Swift 4.2.3 <i>on Ubuntu 18.04</i> as well as the <code>unic_segment</code> 0.9.0 Rust crate counted one extended grapheme cluster, the <code>unicode-segmentation</code> 1.3.0 Rust crate counted two extended grapheme clusters, and <i>the same version of Swift</i>, 4.2.3, but on a <i>different operating system version</i> counted three extended grapheme clusters!</p>

<p>Swift 4 delegates Unicode segmentation to operating system-provided ICU, and “Long-Term Support” in the Ubuntu case means security patches but does not mean rolling forward the Unicode version that the system copy of ICU knows about. In the case of iOS, delegating to system ICU is probably OK and will not lead to too high probability of the text being from the future from the point of view of the OS copy of ICU, since the iOS ecosystem stays exceptionally well <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/">up-to-date</a>. However, delegating to system ICU is not such a great match for the idea of using Swift on the server side if the server side means running an old LTS distro.</p>

<p>(Swift 5 appears to no longer use system ICU for this. That is, Swift 5.0.3 on Ubuntu 14.04 sees one extended grapheme cluster in the string. I haven’t investigated what Swift 5 uses, but I assume that the switch to UTF-8 string representation necessitated using something other than ICU, which is heavily UTF-16-oriented. However, the result with Swift 4.2.3 nicely illustrates the issue related to using extended grapheme clusters.)</p>

<p>If you are doing things that <i>have to</i> be extended grapheme cluster-aware, there just is no way around the issue of not being able to correctly segment text that comes from the future relative to the Unicode segmentation implementation that your program is using. This is not a reason to avoid extended grapheme clusters for tasks that <i>require</i> awareness of extended grapheme clusters.</p>

<p>However, pushing extended grapheme clusters onto tasks that do not really require the use of extended grapheme cluster introduces failure modes arising from the Unicode version dependency where such a dependency isn’t strictly necessary. For example, the Unicode version dependency of extended grapheme clusters means that you should <i>never</i> persist indices into a Swift strings and load them back in a future execution of your app, because an intervening Unicode data update may change the meaning of the persisted indices! The Swift string documentation does not warn against this.</p>

<p>You might think that this kind of thing is a theoretical issue that will never bite anyone, but even experts in data persistence, the developers of PostgreSQL, managed to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/BA6132ED-1F6B-4A0B-AC22-81278F5AB81E%40tripadvisor.com">make backup restorability dependent on collation order</a>, which may change with glibc updates.</p>

<p>Let’s consider other languages a bit.</p>

<p>C++ is often deployed such that the application developer doesn’t ship the standard library with the program. Most obviously, relying on GNU libstdc++ provided by an LTS Linux distribution presents similar problems as Swift 4 relying on ICU provided by an LTS Linux distribution. This isn’t a Linux-specific issue. Old supported branches of Windows <a href="https://github.com/sg16-unicode/sg16-meetings#may-22nd-2019">generally don’t get new system-level Unicode data</a>, either. Even though there is some movement towards individual applications shipping their own copy of LLVM libc++ with the application and the increased pace of C++ standard development starting with C++11 has made using a system-provided C++ standard library more problematic even ignoring Unicode considerations, it doesn’t seem like a good idea for C++ to develop a tight coupling with extended grapheme clusters for operations that don’t strictly necessitate it as longs as stuck-in-the-past system libraries (whether the C++ standard library itself or another library that it delegates to) are a significant part of the C++ standard library distribution practice.</p>

<p>There’s <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-segmenter">a proposal</a> to expose extended grapheme cluster segmentation to JavaScript programs. The main problem with this proposal is the implication on APK sizes on Android and the effect of APK sizes on browser competition on Android. But if we ignore that for the moment and imagine this was part of the Web Platform, it would still be problematic to build this dependency into operations for which working on extended grapheme clusters isn’t strictly necessary. While the most popular browsers are evergreen, there’s still a long tail of browser instances that aren’t on the latest engine versions. When JavaScript executes on such browsers, there’d be effects similar to running Swift 4 on Ubuntu 14.04.</p>

<p>In contrast to C++ or JavaScript, the current Rust approach is to statically link all Rust library code, including the standard library, into the executable program. This means that the application distributor is in control of library versions and doesn’t need to worry about the program executing in the context of out-of-date <i>Rust</i> libraries. The flip side is concerns about the size of the executable. People already (rightly or wrongly) complain about the sizes of Rust executables. Pulling in a lot of Unicode data due to baking extended grapheme cluster processing into programs whose problem domain doesn’t strictly require working with extended grapheme clusters would be problematic in embedded contexts where the executable size is a real problem and not just a perceived problem—and would obviously make the perceived problem worse, too. Furthermore, in order to avoid problems similar to those involved in relying on system libraries, baking tight coupling with Unicode data into the standard library necessitates the organizational capability of keeping up with new Unicode versions in this area where not only data in the tables keeps changing but the format of the tables and, therefore, the associated algorithms have still been changing recently. Right now of the two extended grapheme cluster crates outside the Rust standard library, the one that’s organizationally closer to the standard library is the one that’s out of date.</p>

<h2>Why Do We Want to Know Anyway?</h2>

<blockquote>
	<p>“String length is about as meaningful a measurement as string height” – <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/qntm/status/1118993107310325760">@qntm</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Being able to allocate memory for strings gives a legitimate use case for knowing the storage length. However, in cases of Unicode scalar values or extended grapheme clusters, you typically want to iterate over them and look at each one instead of just knowing the count. So why do people want to know the count? As far as I can tell, there are two broad categories: Placing a quota limit that is fuzzy enough that it doesn’t need to be strictly tied to storage and trying to estimate how much text fits for display. Let’s look at the issue of estimating how much display space text takes, because it involves introducing yet another measurement of string length.</p>

<h2>Display Space</h2>

<p>Simply looking at the Latin letters i and m should make it clear that the display size of a string depends on the font and on the specific characters in the string. From this observation, the whole notion of estimating display space by counting characters seems folly. Indeed, if you want to know exactly how much text fits into a given space, you need to run a typesetting algorithm with a specific font, which may have a complex relationship between scalar values and glyphs, to actually see where the overflow starts. Yet, even in the case of the Latin script that has letters such as i and m, e.g. magazine editors can find character counts useful enough for estimating how many print pages an article of a given character count length is going to fill.</p>

<p>As for computer user interfaces, character terminal user interfaces use a monospaced font where both i and m take up one character cell on a grid. In the context of a monospaced font, the extended grapheme cluster count in the context of the Latin script corresponds directly to display space taken. The same obviously applies to the Greek and Cyrillic scripts, which are so close to the Latin script that fonts even intend to reuse glyphs across these scripts. In contrast, CJK ideographs, Japanese kana, and Hangul syllables take two cells of a terminal grid. From the CJK perspective, these are full-width characters and the ASCII characters are half-width characters. There exist also half-width katakana characters which fit into an 8-bit encoding with ASCII and take one cell on the terminal grid and, therefore, are technically easier to fit to Latin script-oriented terminal systems. The display width on a terminal also has a correspondence to byte with the legacy CJK encodings: ASCII takes one byte, a CJK ideograph, a full-width kana or a Hangul syllable takes two bytes. In the case of Shift_JIS, half-width katakana takes one byte per character.</p>

<p>This brings us to the concept of <a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr11/">East Asian Width</a>. ASCII and half-width katakana characters are narrow. CJK ideographs, full-width kana, and Hangul syllables are wide. However, even in the worldview that is split to Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic on one hand and Chinese, Japanese, and Korean on the other hand, there are ambiguities. From the perspective of European legacy encodings, Greek and Cyrillic (as well as accented Latin) is equally wide as ASCII. However, in legacy CJK encodings, Greek and Cyrillic characters take two bytes. This means that in terms of East Asian Width, a string can have a general-purpose width, which resolves these ambiguous characters as narrow, or legacy CJK-context width, which resolves these ambiguous characters as wide.</p>

<p>So is the general-purpose variant (that resolves Greek and Cyrillic characters as narrow) of East Asian Width the one true string length measure? Well, no.</p>

<p>First of all, the concept ignores all scripts that are geographically and in Unicode order between Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic on one hand and CJK on the other (even though some other scripts that are structurally similar to the Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic scripts and make sense for a monospaced font, such as Armenian and the Georgian scripts, fit this concept, too, despite not having a history in pre-Unicode CJK context). As it happens, though, emoji do fit into the concept, except for <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/fantasai/status/1080928442126909440">weird errors in the Unicode database</a>. After all, emoji originate from Japan and were two bytes each when represented using the private use area of Shift_JIS.</p>

<p>Second, the concept assumes that there is one-to-one correspondence between scalar values and extended grapheme clusters. If we run this Rust program:</p>

<pre>use unicode_width::UnicodeWidthStr;

fn main() {
    println!("{}", "🤦🏼‍♂️".width());
}</pre>

<p>it prints:</p>

<pre>5</pre>

<p>This is because the base emoji is wide (2), the combining skin tone modifier is also wide (2), the male sign is counted as narrow (1), and the zero-width joiner and the variation selector are treated as control characters that don’t count towards width. Obviously, this is not the answer that we want. The answer we want is 2. Ideas that come to mind immediately, such as only counting the width of the first character in an extended grapheme cluster or taking the width of the widest character in an extended grapheme cluster, don’t work, because flag emoji consist of two regional indicator symbol letter characters both of which have East Asian Width of Neutral (i.e. they are counted as narrow but are not marked as narrow, because they are considered to exist outside the domain of East Asian typography). I’m not aware of any official Unicode definition that would reliably return 2 as the width of every kind of emoji. 😭</p>

<p>If you really must estimate display size without running text layout with a font, whether the extended grapheme cluster count or the East Asian Width of the string works better depends on context.</p>

<h2>Arbitrary but Fair Quotas</h2>

<p>In some cases there is a desire to impose a length limit that doesn’t arise from a strict storage limitation. For example, in the STUN protocol given earlier, presumably there is a desire to make it so that human-readable error messages cannot make protocol messages arbitrarily long. For example, in the case of Twitter, tweets being short is a core part of the type of expression that Twitter is about, so some definition of “short” is needed. In the case of string-based browser <code>localStorage</code>, there is a need to have <i>some</i> limit, but the limit is necessarily arbitrary and does not need to strictly map to bytes on disk.</p>

<p>In cases like this, there seems to be some concern that the limit should be internationally fair. Observations that UTF-8 and UTF-16 take a different amount of storage per character depending on the character superficially suggests that the UTF-8 length or the UTF-16 length might be unfair internationally.</p>

<p>What’s fair, though? The usual concern goes that UTF-8 favors English, because English takes one byte per character, and disfavors CJK, because Chinese, Japanese, and Korean take three bytes per character, so UTF-8 in unfair to CJK. This kind of analysis ignores how much information is conveyed per character. To assess what lengths we get for different languages when the amount of information conveyed is kept constant, I looked at the counts for the translations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This is a document for which <a href="https://www.unicode.org/udhr/translations.html">translation of the same content is available in particularly many languages</a>, which is why I used it as the measurement corpus.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, not all translations contain the same text, so one needs to be careful when preparing the data for comparison. Some translations are incomplete, in some cases, <i>very</i> incomplete. For this reason, I included only translations in stage 4 or stage 5 along the 5-stage scale. Some translations carry the preamble with the recitals, but some do not. Some also carry historical notes. To make the length comparable, the preamble, notes, and whitespace-only text nodes were omitted. The rest of the XML text nodes were concatenated and normalized to Unicode Normalition Form C before counting. (<a href="https://github.com/hsivonen/udhrlen">Source code is available</a>.)</p>

<p>Let’s look at the result. The table at the end of this document is sortable and is initially sorted by UTF-8 length. Each Δ% column shows how much the count in the column to its left deviates from the <i>median</i> count for that. (A note about color-coding. Coloring longer than median as red should not be taken to imply that those languages are somehow bad. It’s meant to imply that a length quota treats those languages badly.) In the table, the name of each language links to the translation in that language hosted on the site of the Unicode Consortium. The linked HTML versions may include the preamble and/or notes.</p>

<p>The CJK concern is alleviated when considering information conveyed. When measuring UTF-8 length, Mandarin using traditional characters is the shortest of the languages that have global name recognition! This should be expected, since the Han script pretty obviously packs more information per character than e.g. alphabetic scripts. (The globally less-known languages whose UTF-8 length is shorter than Mandarin’s (using traditional characters) are African and American Latin-script languages with a relatively small native speaker population for each—only one with a native speaker population exceeding a million and many whose native speaker population is smaller than 100 000, which explains why you might not recognize their names.)</p>

<p>Korean is also shorter than median in UTF-8 length. This also makes sense, since Hangul syllables pack three or two alphabetic jamo into one three-byte character. The UTF-8 length of Japanese is over median but only by 4.1%. The Japanese version of the text is 48% kanji and 52% hiragana. Japanese Wikipedia has almost the same kana to kanji ratio, though different kana: 46% kanji and the rest almost evenly split between hiragana and katakana, so we may assume the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to be representative of Japanese text in terms of kana to kanji ratio.</p>

<p>When sorting by UTF-16 code unit count, UTF-32 / scalar value count, or extended grapheme cluster count, CJK are the shortest. While it’s true that UTF-8 takes more bytes for CJK than UTF-16, the notion of UTF-8 being particularly disfavorable to CJK is not true <i>relative to other languages</i>. Rather, UTF-16 is particularly favorable to CJK. In particular, the Han script is so information-dense that even when sorting by East Asian Width, which effectively doubles the length of CJK but not other languages, Han-script languages stay clustered at the start of the table. Korean and Japanese move further but remain below median.</p>

<p>The language with the longest UTF-8 length is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shan_language">Shan</a>, which uses the Burmese script. The Burmese language, also using the Burmese script, is the second-longest in UTF-8 length. There are a number of other Brahmic-script languages among the ones with the longest UTF-8 length. They use three bytes per character but don’t have CJK-like information per character density. These languages are below median in extended grapheme cluster count. In scalar value count, they intermingle with alphabetic languages.</p>

<p>It’s not clear if the concepts of median and mean (average) are meaningful. Does it make sense for a language with tens of millions of native speakers to count as an equal data point as a language with tens of thousands native speakers? Since this is about writing, should the numbers of writers be considered instead? (I.e. should literacy rates be taken into account?) In the hope that with a large number of languages in the table, median hand-wavily sorts out this kind of issue, I chose to compare with median. At least the Han-script languages have comparable numbers of native speakers as the Bhramic-script languages and provide a counter-weight at the other end of the spectrum of UTF-8 length. In any case, for measures other than UTF-8 length, median and mean are very close to each other.</p>

<p>Saying that Brahmic-script languages intermingle with alphabetic languages in character count is rather meaningless, though. In character count, after CJK (and Han-script Vietnamese and Yi-script Nousu), the language with the smallest character count is a Latin-script language (Waama). Also, the language with the largest character count is a Latin-script language (Ashéninka, Pichis). (<s>I find it odd that in UTF-8 length Ashéninka Perené is the second-shortest but Ashéninka, Pichis is long enough to reach the Brahmic cluster. I don’t know what the relation of these two languages is and what explains two languages whose name suggests close relation ending up in opposite extremes in length.</s> Update: It has been pointed out to me that the supposed Ashéninka Perené translation is a mislabeled duplicate of the Cashinahua translation.)</p>

<p>One might hypothesize that the Latin script has just been put to so many uses that some of the uses have to be far from what it has been optimized for. Yet, when considering language-specific alphabets, the character counts for Greek and Georgian are above median. It just is the case that languages are different. In that sense, the whole notion of trying to find a simple length measure that is fair across languages seems folly.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the the factor between the minimum and maximum of each measure, i.e. the factor with which the minimum needs to be multiplied to get the maximum. Let’s even ignore the outlier for maximum for each measure and use the second largest value instead of the largest value for each count. (Otherwise, Ashéninka, Pichis alone would skew the numbers a lot.) We get these factors:</p>

<table>
	<tbody><tr><th>UTF-8</th><td>8.6</td></tr>
	<tr><th>UTF-16</th><td>7.9</td></tr>
	<tr><th>UTF-32</th><td>7.9</td></tr>
	<tr><th>EGC</th><td>7.9</td></tr>
	<tr><th>EAW</th><td>4.3</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>UTF-16, UTF-32, and extended grapheme clusters aren’t distinguished by this measure, because the languages at the extremes use characters from the Basic Multilingual Plane with one character per grapheme cluster. Considering that there are supplementary-plane scripts, arguably the UTF-32 count would be fairer than the UTF-16 count even though this factor doesn’t show the difference. It’s not clear that counting extended grapheme clusters would be particularly fair compared to counting characters: It favors scripts that are visually joining over scripts that aren’t visually joining even if there’s no logical difference. While looking at just the factor, East Asian Width makes the gap the smallest, but it’s a rather imprecise fairness solution. It just counts CJK as double. Even after this, the Han-script languages are still among the ones with the smallest counts. On the other hand, it seems unfair to recognize Hangul syllables and kana as carrying more information than an alphabetic character while not giving the same treatment to other syllabaries, such as the Ethiopic script, Ge’ez.</p>

<p>Twitter counts each CJK character (including three-jamo Hangul syllables; i.e. it is not decomposing Hangul and treating it as alphabetic) as consuming 2 units of the quota (as when counting East Asian Width), counts emoji as consuming two units (even when East Asian Width of the cluster would be more), and, unlike East Asian Width, counts each Ethiopic syllable as consuming two units of the quota. What Twitter does seems fairer than just applying East Asian Width, but the result is still that the amount of information that can be packed in a tweet can vary four-fold depending on language. That still doesn’t seem exactly fair across languages.</p>

<p>In closing:</p>

<ul>
	<li>There is no simple measure of string length that would be fair in terms of how much information can be conveyed within a length quota regardless of language.</li>
	<li>Of solutions that don’t depend on the Unicode database and, therefore, the Unicode version and that don’t ad-hoc hard-code character ranges according to a particular version of Unicode, counting characters aka. scalar values i.e. UTF-32 length is the best that can be done. It’s still wildly unfair leading to almost eight-fold differences in how much information can be conveyed. This is not a flaw of Unicode but arises from differences in languages and writing systems.</li>
	<li>While counting scalar values is fairer than just counting UTF-8 or UTF-16 code units, the factor between minimum and maximum UTF-8 length is so close to the factor between minimum and maximum UTF-32 length, both of which are pretty large, that instead of putting thought into using the scalar value length instead of the UTF-8 length or the UTF-16 length, it’s probably better to put the thought into reconsidering if you <i>really</i> need to impose such a limit.</li>
	<li>Unicode doesn’t provide a good database-based definition that would improve upon the character count in terms of normalizing the amount of information conveyed. While East Asian Width brings minimum and maximum closer, it unfairly singles out Hangul syllables and kana without considering other syllabaries, because normalizing length for information conveyed is not the purpose of East Asian Width.</li>
	<li>Even if per-script (possibly non-integer) weights assigned to characters could make things fairer, it wouldn’t work well for the Latin script, which is all over the place in terms of language-dependent length.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">


  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Around the turn of the century we started to get a bigger need for high
capacity web servers. For example there was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C10k_problem">the C10k problem</a> paper.</p>

<p>At the time, the kinds of things done to reduce work done per request was
pre-forking the web server. This means a request could be handled without an
expensive process creation.</p>

<p>Because yes, creating a new process for every request used to be something
perfectly normal.</p>

<p>Things did get better. People learned how to create threads, making things more
light weight. Then they switched to using <code>poll()</code>/<code>select()</code>, in order to not
just spare the process/thread creation, but the whole context switch.</p>

<p>I remember a comment on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuro5hin">Kuro5hin</a> from anakata, the creator of both The
Pirate Bay and the web server that powered it, along the lines of “I am select()
of borg, resistance is futile”, mocking someone for not understanding how to
write a scalable web server.</p>

<p>But <code>select()</code>/<code>poll()</code> also doesn’t scale. If you have ten thousand
connections, that’s an array of ten thousand integers that need to be sent to
the kernel for every single iteration of your request handling loop.</p>

<p>Enter <code>epoll</code> (<code>kqueue</code> on other operating systems, but I’m focusing on Linux
here). Now that’s better. The main loop is now:</p>

<div><pre><code>  set_up_epoll()
  while True:
    new, read, write = epoll()
    epoll_add_connections(new)
    for con in read:
      process(con.read())
      if con.read_all_we_need:
        epoll_remove_read_op(con)
    for con in write:
      con.write_buffer()
      if con.buffer_empty:
        epoll_remove_write_op(con)
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>All the syscalls are pretty cheap. <code>epoll()</code> only deals in deltas, and it
doesn’t have to be re-told the thousands of active connections.</p>

<p>But they’re not without cost. Once we’ve gotten this far, the cost of a syscall
is actually a significant part of the total remaining cost.</p>

<p>We’re here going to ignore improvements like <code>sendfile()</code> and <code>splice()</code>, and
instead jump to…</p>



<p>Instead of performing a syscall for everything we want to do, commanding the
kernel to do this or that, io_uring lets us just keep writing orders to a
queue, and letting the kernel consume that queue asynchronously.</p>

<p>For example, we can put <code>accept()</code> into the queue. The kernel will pick that
up, wait for an incoming connection, and when it arrives it’ll put a
“completion” into the completion queue.</p>

<p>The web server can then check the completion queue. If there’s a completion
there, it can act on it.</p>

<p>This way the web server can queue up all kinds of operations that were
previously “expensive” syscalls by simply writing them to memory. That’s it.
And then it’ll read the results from another part of memory. That’s it.</p>

<p>In order to avoid busy looping, both the kernel and the web server will only
busy-loop checking the queue for a little bit (configurable, but think
milliseconds), and if there’s nothing new, the web server will do a syscall to
“go to sleep” until something gets added to the queue.</p>

<p>Similarly on the kernel side, the kernel will stop busy-looping if there’s
nothing new, and needs a syscall to start busylooping again.</p>

<p>This sounds like it would be tricky to optimize, but it’s not. In the end the
web server just puts stuff on the queue, and calls a library function that only
does that syscall if the kernel actually has stopped busylooping.</p>

<p>This means that a busy web server can serve all of its queries without even once
(after setup is done) needing to do a syscall. As long as queues keep getting
added to, <code>strace</code> will show <em>nothing</em>.</p>

<h2 id="one-thread-per-core">One thread per core</h2>

<p>Since CPUs today have many cores, ideally you want to run exactly one thread
per core, bind it to that core, and not share any read-write data structure.</p>

<p>For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_memory_access">NUMA</a> hardware, you also want to make sure that a thread only
accesses memory on the local NUMA node. <a href="https://youtu.be/36qZYL5RlgY">This netflix talk</a> has some
interesting stuff on NUMA and high volume HTTP delivery.</p>

<p>The request load will still not be perfectly balanced between the threads (and
therefore cores), but I guess fixing that would have to be the topic of a
future post.</p>

<h2 id="memory-allocations">Memory allocations</h2>

<p>We will still have memory allocations though, both on the kernel and web server
side. Memory allocations in user space will eventually need syscalls.</p>

<p>For the web server side, you can pre-allocate a fixed chunk for every
connection, and then have everything about that connection live there. That way
new connections don’t need syscalls, memory doesn’t get fragmented, and you
don’t run the risk of running out of memory.</p>

<p>On the kernel side each connection will still need buffers for incoming and
outgoing bytes. This may be somewhat controllable via socket options, but again
it’ll have to be the subject of a future post.</p>

<p>Try to not run out of RAM. Bad things tend to happen.</p>

<h2 id="ktls">kTLS</h2>

<p><a href="https://docs.kernel.org/networking/tls-offload.html">kTLS</a> is a feature of the Linux kernel where an application can hand off
the job of encryption/decryption to the kernel. The application still has to
perform the TLS handshake, but after that it can enable kTLS and pretend that
it’s all sent in plaintext.</p>

<p>You may say that this doesn’t actually speed anything up, it just moves <em>where</em>
encryption was done. But there are gains:</p>

<ol>
  <li>This means that <code>sendfile()</code> can be used, removing the need to copy a bunch
of data between user space and kernel space.</li>
  <li>If the network card has hardware support for it, the crypto operation may
actually be offloaded from the CPU onto the network card, leaving the CPU to
do better things.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="descriptorless-files">Descriptorless files</h2>

<p>Another optimization is to avoid passing file descriptors back and forth
between user space and kernel space. The mapping between file descriptors and
io_uring apparently has overhead.</p>

<p>So in comes <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/863071/">descriptorless files</a> via
<a href="https://docs.rs/io-uring/latest/io_uring/struct.Submitter.html#method.register_files"><code>register_files</code></a>.</p>

<p>Now the supposed file descriptor numbers that user space sees are just
integers. They don’t show up in <code>/proc/pid/fd</code>, and can only be used with
io_uring. They’re still capped by the <code>ulimit</code> file descriptor limit, though.</p>

<h2 id="tarweb">tarweb</h2>

<p>In order to learn these technologies better, I built <a href="https://github.com/ThomasHabets/tarweb">a web server
incorporating all these things</a>.</p>

<p>It’s named <code>tarweb</code> because it’s a web server that serves the content of a
single tar file.</p>

<p>Rust, io_uring, and kTLS. Not exactly the most common combination. I found that
io_uring and kTLS didn’t play super well together. Enabling kTLS requires three
<code>setsockopt()</code> calls, and io_uring doesn’t support <code>setsockopt</code> (until they
merge <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/io-uring/pull/320">my PR</a>, that is).</p>

<p>And the <code>ktls</code> crate, part of <code>rustls</code>, only allows you to call the synchronous
<code>setsockopt()</code>, not export the needed struct for me to pass to my new
io_uring <code>setsockopt</code>. <a href="https://github.com/rustls/ktls/pull/54">Another pr sent</a>.</p>

<p>So with those two PRs merged, it’s working great.</p>

<p>tarweb is far from perfect. The code needs a lot of work, and there’s no
guarantee that the TLS library (rustls) doesn’t do memory allocations during
handshakes. But it does serve https without even one syscall on a per request
basis. And that’s pretty cool.</p>

<h2 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h2>

<p>I have not done any benchmarks yet. I want to clean the code up first.</p>

<h2 id="io-uring-and-safety">io-uring and safety</h2>

<p>One thing making io_uring more complex than synchronous syscalls is that any
buffer needs to stay in memory until the operation is marked completed by
showing up in the completion queue.</p>

<p>For example when submitting a <code>write</code> operation, the memory location of those
bytes must not be deallocated or overwritten.</p>

<p>The <code>io-uring</code> crate doesn’t help much with this. The API doesn’t allow the
borrow checker to protect you at compile time, and I don’t see it doing any
runtime checks either.</p>

<p>I feel like I’m back in C++, where any mistake can blow your whole leg off.
It’s a miracle that I’ve not seen a segfault.</p>

<p>Someone should make a <code>safer-ring</code> crate or similar, using the powers of
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/pin-and-unpin-in-rust/">pinning</a> and/or borrows or something, to achieve Rust’s normal “if it
compiles, then it’s correct”.</p>

        <p>Anthology of sociology, statistical, or psychological papers discussing the observation that all real-world variables have non-zero correlations and the implications for statistical theory such as ‘null hypothesis testing’.</p>
        
      </div><div id="markdownBody"><div>
<blockquote>
<p>Statistical folklore asserts that “everything is correlated”: in any real-world dataset, most or all measured variables will have non-zero correlations, even between variables which appear to be completely independent of each other, and that these correlations are not merely sampling error flukes but will appear in large-scale datasets to arbitrarily designated levels of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance" id="_P2KpkSBK" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance#bodyContent" title="Statistical-significance">statistical-significance</a> or posterior probability.</p>
<p>This raises serious questions for null-hypothesis statistical-significance testing, as it implies the null hypothesis of 0 will always be rejected with sufficient data, meaning that a failure to reject only implies insufficient data, and provides no actual test or confirmation of a theory. Even a directional prediction is minimally confirmatory since there is a 50% chance of picking the right direction at random.</p>
<p>It also has implications for conceptualizations of theories &amp; causal models, interpretations of structural models, and other statistical principles such as the “sparsity principle”.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Knowing one variable tells you (a little) about everything else. In statistics &amp; psychology folklore, this idea circulates under many names: “everything is correlated”, “everything is related to everything else”, “crud factor”, “the null hypothesis is always false”, “coefficients are never zero”, “ambient correlational noise”, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Thorndike" id="_eD7_4_zC" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Thorndike#bodyContent" title="Edward Thorndike">Thorndike’s</a> dictum (“in human nature good traits go together”<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>), etc. Closely related are the <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/www/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/75d8bce1345921c88e4a5c0aa10ebf503f3f1429.pdf#page=518" id="_BDPfCSfr" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-link-icon-color="#f40f02" data-url-archive="/doc/www/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/75d8bce1345921c88e4a5c0aa10ebf503f3f1429.pdf#page=518" data-url-original="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.644.2669&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf#page=518" title="'In praise of sparsity and convexity', Tibshirani 2014">“bet on sparsity principle”</a><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Karenina_principle" id="_zDohaOlu" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Karenina_principle#bodyContent" title="Anna Karenina principle">Anna Karenina principle</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Commoner" id="_OEwL_s8W" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Commoner#bodyContent" title="Barry Commoner">Barry Commoner’s</a> “first law of ecology” (“Everything is connected to everything else”) &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldo_R._Tobler" id="_2174Ovvd" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldo_R._Tobler#bodyContent" title="Waldo R.

<p>The core idea here is that in any real-world dataset, it is exceptionally unlikely that any particular relationship will be exactly 0 for reasons of arithmetic (eg. it may be impossible for a binary variable to be an equal percentage in 2 unbalanced groups); prior probability (0 is only one number out of the infinite reals); and because real-world properties &amp; traits are linked by a myriad of causal networks, dynamics, &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_and_observable_variables" id="_hM0a8AZP" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_and_observable_variables#bodyContent" title="Latent and observable variables">latent</a> variables (eg. the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_correlation" id="_EFM6e8jH" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_correlation#bodyContent" title="Genetic correlation">genetic correlations</a> which affect all human traits, see <a href="#genetic-correlations">heat maps in appendix</a> for visualizations) which mutually affect each other which will produce genuine correlations between apparently-independent variables, and these correlations may be of surprisingly large &amp; important size.</p>
<p>These reasons are unaffected by sample size and are not simply due to ‘small <em>n</em>’. If we simulate out uncorrelated random variables, even with small sizes, they quickly approach absolute correlations of ~0, and few will be of meaningful size like |<em>r</em>| &gt; 0.10:</p>

</figure>
<p>The claim is generally backed up by personal experience and reasoning, although in a few instances like Meehl large datasets are mentioned in which almost all variables are correlated at high levels of statistical-significance.</p>
<section id="importance">
<h2><a href="#importance" title="Link to section: § 'Importance'">Importance</a></h2>
<p>This claim has several implications:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Sharp null hypotheses are meaningless</strong>: The most commonly mentioned, and the apparent motivation for early discussions, is that in the null-hypothesis <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_test" id="_OtaIDcz3" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_test#bodyContent" title="Statistical hypothesis test">significance-testing</a> paradigm dominant in psychology and many sciences, any sharp null-hypothesis such as a parameter (like a Pearson’s <em>r</em> correlation) being exactly equal to 0 is known—in advance—to already be false and so it will inevitably be rejected as soon as sufficient data collection permits sampling to the foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>The existence of pervasive correlations, in addition to the presence of systematic error<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, guarantees nonzero ‘effects’. This renders the meaning of significance-testing unclear; it is calculating precisely the odds of the data under scenarios known <em>a priori</em> to be false.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Directional hypotheses are little better</strong>: better null-hypotheses, such as &gt;0 or &lt;0, are also problematic since if the true value of a parameter is never 0 then one’s theories have at least a 50-50 chance of guessing the right direction and so correct ‘predictions’ of the sign count for little.</p>
<p>This renders any successful predictions of little value.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Model interpretation is difficult</strong>: This extensive intercorrelation threatens many naive statistical models or theoretical interpretations thereof, quite aside from <em>p</em>-values</p>
<p>For example, given the large amounts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_error" id="_5Yg7bDxK" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_error#bodyContent" title="Observational error">measurement error</a> in most sociological or psychological traits such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_status" id="__fxxFvC3" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomic_status#bodyContent" title="Socioeconomic status">SES</a>, home environment, or IQ, fully ‘controlling for’ a latent variable based on measured variables is difficult or impossible and said variable will in fact be correlated with the primary variable of interest, leading to <span id="gwern-notes-regression"></span> <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/statistics/bayes/regression-to-mean/index" id="_8LEzTTCn" data-filesize-bytes="43699" data-filesize-percentage="38" title="'Regression To The Mean Fallacies', Gwern 2021">“residual confounding”</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Intercorrelation implies causal networks</strong>: The empirical fact of extensive intercorrelations is consistent with the <a href="https://gwern.net/causality" id="gwern-causality" data-filesize-bytes="54123" data-filesize-percentage="42" title="'Why Correlation Usually ≠ Causation', Gwern 2014">existence of complex causal networks &amp; latent variables</a> (often factors) linking all measured traits, such as extensive heritability &amp; genetic correlations of human traits, leading to <a href="https://gwern.net/correlation" id="gwern-correlation" data-filesize-bytes="144066" data-filesize-percentage="63" title="'How Often Does Correlation=Causality?', Gwern 2014">extensive examples of correlation ≠ causation</a>.</p>
<p>The existence of both “everything is correlated” and the success of the “bet on sparsity” principle suggests that these causal networks may be best thought of as having hubs or latent variables: there are a relatively few variables such as ‘arousal’ or ‘IQ’ which play central roles, explaining much of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance" id="_yzXH8kID" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance#bodyContent" title="Variance">variance</a>, followed by almost all other variables accounting for a little bit each with most of their influence mediated through the key variables.</p>
<p>The fact that these variables can be successfully modeled as substantively linear or additive further implies that interactions between variables will be typically rare or small or both (implying further that most such hits will be false positives, as interactions are already harder to detect than main effects, and more so if they are <em>a priori</em> unlikely or of small size). Even extremely large &amp; deeply phenotyped datasets may struggle to achieve impressive improvements over baselines using the core variables (eg. <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1915006117" id="_0OTythr1" data-link-icon="PNAS" data-link-icon-type="text,quad" data-link-icon-color="#1f75b9" title="Measuring the predictability of life outcomes with a scientific mass collaboration"><span><span title="et al">Salganik</span><span> et al </span><span>2020</span></span></a>).</p>
<p>To the extent that these key variables are unmodifiable, the many peripheral variables may also be unmodifiable (which may be related to the <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/sociology/1987-rossi" id="rossi-2012" data-filesize-bytes="84889" data-filesize-percentage="50" title="The Iron Law Of Evaluation And Other Metallic Rules">broad failure of social intervention programs</a>). Any intervention on those peripheral variables, being ‘downstream’, will tend to either be ‘hollow’ or fade out or have no effect at all on the true desired goals no matter how consistently they are correlated.</p>
<p>On a more contemporary note, these theoretical &amp; empirical considerations also throw doubt on concerns about ‘algorithmic bias’ or inferences drawing on ‘protected classes’: not drawing on them may not be desirable, possible, or even meaningful.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Uncorrelated variables may be meaningless</strong>: given this empirical reality, any variable which is uncorrelated with the major variables is suspicious (somewhat like the <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/genetics/heritable/2015-polderman.pdf" id="polderman-et-al-2015-02" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-link-icon-color="#f40f02" data-filesize-bytes="10395460" data-filesize-percentage="95" title="'Meta-analysis of the heritability of human traits based on 50 years of twin studies', Polderman et al 2015">pervasiveness of heritability</a> in human traits renders traits with zero heritability suspicious, suggesting issues like measuring at the wrong time). The lack of correlation suggests that the analysis is underpowered, something has gone wrong in the construction of the variable/dataset, or that the variable is part of a system whose causal network renders conventional analyses dangerously misleading.</p>
<p>For example, the dataset may be corrupted by a systematic bias such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_conclusion_validity#Restriction_of_range" id="_FX37JfKA" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_conclusion_validity#bodyContent" title="Statistical conclusion validity § Restriction of range">range restriction</a> or a selection effect such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox" id="_vvExW5j4" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox#bodyContent" title="Simpson's paradox">Simpson’s paradox</a>, which erases from the data a correlation that actually exists. Or the data may be random noise, due to software error or fraud or extremely high levels of measurement error (such as <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/sociology/survey/lizardman/index" id="_aSDAgurb" data-filesize-bytes="26046" data-filesize-percentage="29" title="'Lizardman Constant in Surveys', Gwern 2013">“lizardman constant”</a> respondents answering at random); or the variable may not be real in the first place. Another possibility is that the variable is causally connected, in feedback loops (especially common in economics or biology), to another variable, in which case the standard statistical machinery is misleading—the classic example is Milton Friedman’s thermostat, noting that a thermostat would be almost entirely uncorrelated with room temperature.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This idea, as suggested by the many names, is not due to any single theoretical or empirical result or researcher, but has been made many times by many different researchers in many contexts, circulating as informal ‘folklore’. To bring some order to this, I have compiled excerpts of some relevant references in chronological order. (Additional citations are welcome.)</p>

<p>In early November <span>1904<sub><span title="1904 was 121 years ago.">121ya</span></sub></span>, Gosset discussed his first breakthrough in an internal report entitled “The Application of the ‘Law of Error’ to the Work of the Brewery” (<span><span>Gosset</span><span>1904</span></span>; <em>Laboratory Report</em><span>, Nov. 3, <span>1904<sub><span title="1904 was 121 years ago.">121ya</span></sub></span>, pg3).

<li><p>On the importance of the issues at stake.</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Two features of Gosset’s report are especially worth highlighting here. First, he suggested that judgments about “significant” differences were not a purely probabilistic exercise: they depend on the “importance of the issues at stake.” Second, Gosset underscored a positive correlation in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution" id="_T4iJJGn_" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution#bodyContent" title="Normal distribution">normal distribution</a> curve between “the square root of the number of observations” and the level of statistical-significance. Other things equal, he wrote, “the greater the number of observations of which means are taken [the larger the sample size], the smaller the [probable or standard] error” (pg5). “And the curve which represents their frequency of error”, he illustrated, “becomes taller and narrower” (pg7).</p>
<p>Since its discovery in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century, tables of the normal probability curve had been created for large samples…The relation between sample size and “significance” was rarely explored. For example, while looking at biometric samples with up to thousands of observations, Karl Pearson declared that a result departing by more than 3 standard deviations is “definitely significant.”<sup>12</sup> Yet Gosset, a self-trained statistician, found that at such large samples, nearly everything is <em>statistically</em> “significant”—though not, in Gosset’s terms, economically or scientifically “important.” Regardless, Gosset didn’t have the luxury of large samples. One of his earliest experiments employed a sample size of 2 (Gosset, <span>1904<sub><span title="1904 was 121 years ago.">121ya</span></sub></span>, p.7) and in fact in <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/www/bayes.wustl.edu/62eb6502694eb3955a937b5683e29fc6252a45a4.pdf" id="_zGZU9cFr" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-link-icon-color="#f40f02" data-url-archive="/doc/www/bayes.wustl.edu/62eb6502694eb3955a937b5683e29fc6252a45a4.pdf" data-url-original="https://bayes.wustl.edu/Manual/Student.pdf" data-filesize-bytes="815807" data-filesize-percentage="45">“The Probable Error of a Mean”</a> he calculated a <em>t</em> statistic for <em>n</em><span> = 2 (Student, <span>1908<sub><span title="1908 was 117 years ago.">117ya</span></sub></span>b, p.&nbsp;23).</span></p>
<p>…the “degree of certainty to be aimed at”, Gosset wrote, depends on the opportunity cost of following a result as if true, added to the opportunity cost of conducting the experiment itself. Gosset never deviated from this central position.15 [See, for example, Student (<a href="https://gwern.net/doc/statistics/decision/1923-student.pdf" id="gosset-1923" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-link-icon-color="#f40f02" data-filesize-bytes="2735480" data-filesize-percentage="88" title="On Testing Varieties of Cereals">1923, p.&nbsp;271, paragraph one</a>: “The object of testing varieties of cereals is to find out which will pay the farmer best.”) and Student (<a href="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.233812/page/n168" id="_r4jMMmxR" data-link-icon="internet-archive" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.233812/page/n168?view=theater" title="Yield trials">1931c</a>, p.&nbsp;1342, paragraph one) reprinted in Student (<span>1942<sub><span title="1942 was 83 years ago.">83ya</span></sub></span>, p.&nbsp;90 and p.&nbsp;150).]</p>

<p>…the significance of intelligence for success in a given activity of life is measured by the coefficient of correlation between them. Scientific investigations of these matters is just beginning; and it is a matter of great difficulty and expense to measure the intelligence of, say, a thousand clergymen, and then secure sufficient evidence to rate them accurately for their success as ministers of the Gospel. Consequently, one can report no final, perfectly authoritative results in this field. One can only organize reasonable estimates from the various partial investigations that have been made. Doing this, I find the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Intelligence and success in the elementary schools, <em>r</em> = +0.80</p></li>
<li><p>Intelligence and success in high-school and colleges in the case of those who go, <em>r</em> = +0.60; but if all were forced to try to do this advanced work, the correlation would be +0.80 or more.</p></li>
<li><p>Intelligence and salary, <em>r</em> = +0.35.</p></li>
<li><p>Intelligence and success in athletic sports, <em>r</em> = +0.25</p></li>
<li><p>Intelligence and character, <em>r</em> = +0.40</p></li>
<li><p>Intelligence and popularity, <em>r</em> = +0.20</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever be the eventual exact findings, two sound principles are illustrated by our provisional list. First, there is always some resemblance; intellect always counts. Second, the resemblance varies greatly; intellect counts much more in some lines than in others.</p>
<p>The first fact is in part a consequence of a still broader fact or principle—namely, that in human nature good traits go together. To him that hath a superior intellect is given also on the average a superior character; the quick boy is also in the long run more accurate; the able boy is also more industrious. There is no principle of compensation whereby a weak intellect is offset by a strong will, a poor memory by good judgment, or a lack of ambition by an attractive personality. Every pair of such supposed compensating qualities that have been investigated has been found really to show correspondence. Popular opinion has been misled by attending to striking individual cases which attracted attention partly because they were really exceptions to the rule. The rule is that desirable qualities are positively correlated. Intellect is good in and of itself, and also for what it implies about other traits.</p>

<p>I believe that an observant statistician who has had any considerable experience with applying the chi-square test repeatedly will agree with my statement that, as a matter of observation, when the numbers in the data are quite large, the <em>P</em>’s tend to come out small. Having observed this, and on reflection, I make the following dogmatic statement, referring for illustration to the normal curve: “If the normal curve is fitted to a body of data representing any real observations whatever of quantities in the physical world, then if the number of observations is extremely large—for instance, on an order of 200,000—the chi-square <em>P</em> will be small beyond any usual limit of significance.”</p>
<p>This dogmatic statement is made on the basis of an extrapolation of the observation referred to and can also be defended as a prediction from <em>a priori</em> considerations. For we may assume that it is practically certain that any series of real observations does not actually follow a normal curve <em>with absolute exactitude</em> in all respects, and no matter how small the discrepancy between the normal curve and the true curve of observations, the chi-square <em>P</em> will be small if the sample has a sufficiently large number of observations in it.</p>
<p>If this be so, then we have something here that is apt to trouble the conscience of a reflective statistician using the chi-square test. For I suppose it would be agreed by statisticians that a large sample is always better than a small sample. If, then, we know in advance the <em>P</em> that will result from an application of a chi-square test to a large sample, there would seem to be no use in doing it on a smaller one. But since the result of the former test is known, it is no test at all.</p>

<p>The general question of significance tests was raised in 7.3 and a simple example will now be considered. Suppose that a die is thrown <em>n</em> times and that it shows an <em>r</em>-face on <em>m<sub>r</sub></em> occasions (<em>r</em> = 1, 2, …, 6). The question is whether the die is loaded. The answer depends on the meaning of “loaded”. From one point of view, it is unnecessary to look at the statistics since it is obvious that no die could be absolutely symmetrical. [It would be no contradiction of 4.3 (2) to say that the hypothesis that the die is absolutely symmetrical is almost impossible. In fact, this hypothesis is an idealised proposition rather than an empirical one.] It is possible that a similar remark applies to all experiments—even to the ESP experiment, since there may be no way of designing it so that the probabilities are <em>exactly</em> equal to <span>1⁄2</span>.</p>

<p>When testing statistical hypotheses, we usually do not wish to take the action of rejection unless the hypothesis being tested is false to an extent sufficient to matter. For example, we may formulate the hypothesis that a population is normally distributed, but we realize that no natural population is ever exactly normal. We would want to reject normality only if the departure of the actual distribution from the normal form were great enough to be material for our investigation. Again, when we formulate the hypothesis that the sex ratio is the same in two populations, we do not really believe that it could be exactly the same, and would only wish to reject equality if they are sufficiently different.

<blockquote>
<p>The development of the theory of testing has been much influenced by the special problem of simple dichotomy, that is, testing problems in which <em>H</em><sub>0</sub> and <em>H</em><sub>1</sub> have exactly one element each. Simple dichotomy is susceptible of neat and full analysis (as in Exercise 7.5.2 and in §14.4), likelihood-ratio tests here being the only admissible tests; and simple dichotomy often gives insight into more complicated problems, though the point is not explicitly illustrated in this book.</p>
<p>Coin and ball examples of simple dichotomy are easy to construct, but instances seem rare in real life. The astronomical observations made to distinguish between the Newtonian and Einsteinian hypotheses are a good, but not perfect, example, and I suppose that research in Mendelian genetics sometimes leads to others. There is, however, a tradition of applying the concept of simple dichotomy to some situations to which it is, to say the best, only crudely adapted. Consider, for example, the decision problem of a person who must buy, <strong>f</strong><sub>0</sub>, or refuse to buy, <strong>f</strong><sub>1</sub>, a lot of manufactured articles on the basis of an observation <em>x</em>. Suppose that <em>i</em> is the difference between the value of the lot to the person and the price at which the lot is offered for sale, and that <em>P(x | i)</em> is known to the person. Clearly, <em>H</em><sub>0</sub>, <em>H</em><sub>1</sub>, and <em>N</em> are sets characterized respectively by <em>i</em> &gt; 0, <em>i</em> &lt; 0, <em>i</em> = 0. This analysis of this, and similar, problems has recently been explored in terms of the minimax rule, for example by Sprowls [S16] and a little more fully by Rudy [R4], and by Allen [A3]. It seems to me natural and promising for many fields of application, but it is not a traditional analysis. On the contrary, much literature recommends, in effect, that the person pretend that only two values of <em>i</em>, <em>i</em><sub>0</sub> &gt; 0 and <em>i</em><sub>1</sub> &lt; 0, are possible and that the person then choose a test for the resulting simple dichotomy. The selection of the two values <em>i</em><sub>0</sub> and <em>i</em><sub>1</sub> is left to the person, though they are sometimes supposed to correspond to the person’s judgment of what constitutes good quality and poor quality—terms really quite without definition. The emphasis on simple dichotomy is tempered in some acceptance-sampling literature, where it is recommended that the person choose among available tests by some largely unspecified overall consideration of operating characteristics and costs, and that he facilitate his survey of the available tests by focusing on a pair of points that happen to interest him and considering the test whose operating characteristic passes (economically, in the case of sequential testing) through the pair of points. These traditional analyses are certainly inferior in the theoretical framework of the present discussion, and I think they will be found inferior in practice.</p>
<p>…I turn now to a different and, at least for me, delicate topic in connection with applications of the theory of testing. Much attention is given in the literature of statistics to what purport to be tests of hypotheses, in which the null hypothesis is such that it would not really be accepted by anyone. The following 3 propositions, though playful in content, are typical in form of these <em>extreme</em> null hypotheses, as I shall call them for the moment.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A. The mean noise output of the cereal Krakl is a linear function of the atmospheric pressure, in the range 900–1,100 millibars.</p></li>
<li><p>B. The basal metabolic consumption of sperm whales is normally distributed [Wll].</p></li>
<li><p>C. New York taxi drivers of Irish, Jewish, and Scandinavian extraction are equally proficient in abusive language.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Literally to test such hypotheses as these is preposterous. If, for example, the loss associated with <strong>f</strong><sub>1</sub> is zero, except in case Hypothesis A is exactly satisfied, what possible experience with Krakl could dissuade you from adopting <strong>f</strong><sub>1</sub>?</p>
<p>The unacceptability of extreme null hypotheses is perfectly well known; it is closely related to the often heard maxim that science disproves, but never proves, hypotheses. The role of extreme hypotheses in science and other statistical activities seems to be important but obscure. In particular, though I, like everyone who practices statistics, have often “tested” extreme hypotheses, I cannot give a very satisfactory analysis of the process, nor say clearly how it is related to testing as defined in this chapter and other theoretical discussions. None the less, it seems worth while to explore the subject tentatively; I will do so largely in terms of two examples.</p>
<p>Consider first the problem of a cereal dynamicist who must estimate the noise output of Krakl at each of 10 atmospheric pressures between 900 and 1,100 millibars. It may well be that he can properly regard the problem as that of estimating the 10 parameters in question, in which case there is no question of testing. But suppose, for example, that one or both of the following considerations apply. First, the engineer and his colleagues may attach considerable personal probability to the possibility that A is very nearly satisfied—very nearly, that is, in terms of the dispersion of his measurements. Second, the administrative, computational, and other incidental costs of using 10 individual estimates might be considerably greater than that of using a linear formula.</p>
<p>It might be impractical to deal with either of these considerations very rigorously. One rough attack is for the engineer first to examine the observed data <em>x</em> and then to proceed either as though he actually believed Hypothesis A or else in some other way. The other way might be to make the estimate according to the objectivistic formulae that would have been used had there been no complicating considerations, or it might take into account different but related complicating considerations not explicitly mentioned here, such as the advantage of using a quadratic approximation. It is artificial and inadequate to regard this decision between one class of basic acts or another as a test, but that is what in current practice we seem to do. The choice of which test to adopt in such a context is at least partly motivated by the vague idea that the test should readily accept, that is, result in acting as though the extreme null hypotheses were true, in the farfetched case that the null hypothesis is indeed true, and that the worse the approximation of the null hypotheses to the truth the less probable should be the acceptance.</p>
<p>The method just outlined is crude, to say the best. It is often modified in accordance with common sense, especially so far as the second consideration is concerned. Thus, if the measurements are sufficiently precise, no ordinary test might accept the null hypotheses, for the experiment will lead to a clear and sure idea of just what the departures from the null hypotheses actually are. But, if the engineer considers those departures unimportant for the context at hand, he will justifiably decide to neglect them.</p>
<p>Rejection of an extreme null hypothesis, in the sense of the foregoing discussion, typically gives rise to a complicated subsidiary decision problem. Some aspects of this situation have recently been explored, for example by Paulson [P3], [P4]; Duncan [Dll], [D12]; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey" id="_XocxmpNj" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey#bodyContent" title="John Tukey">Tukey</a> [T4], [<a href="https://gwern.net/doc/www/arxiv.org/6c6da30801f7053b5392a4582eaff2b665d5df34.pdf#google" id="raffel-et-al-2019" data-link-icon="alphabet" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-link-icon-color="#4285f4" data-href-mobile="https://arxiv.org/html/1910.10683?fallback=original#google" data-url-archive="/doc/www/arxiv.org/6c6da30801f7053b5392a4582eaff2b665d5df34.pdf#google" data-url-original="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683#google" title="'T5: Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified Text-to-Text Transformer', Raffel et al 2019">T5</a>]; Schefte [S7]; and W.

<p>…However, the calculation [of error rates of ‘rejecting the null’] is absurdly academic, for in fact no scientific worker has a fixed level of significance at which from year to year and in all circumstances, he rejects hypotheses; he rather gives his mind to each particular case in the light of his evidence and his ideas. Further, the calculation is based solely on a hypothesis, which, in the light of the evidence, is often not believed to be true at all, so that the actual probability of erroneous decision, supposing such a phrase to have any meaning, may be much less than the frequency specifying the level of significance.</p>

<p>A difficulty with this viewpoint is that it is often known that the hypothesis tested could not be precisely true. No coin, for example, has a probability of precisely <span>1⁄2</span> of coming heads. The true probability will always differ from <span>1⁄2</span> even if it differs by only 0.000,000,000,1. Neither will any treatment cure <em>precisely</em> one-third of the patients in the population to which it might be applied, nor will the proportion of voters in a presidential election favoring one candidate be <em>precisely</em> <span>1⁄2</span>. Recognition of this leads to the notion of differences that are or are not of practical importance. “Practical importance” depends on the actions that are going to be taken on the basis of the data, and on the losses from taking certain actions when others would be more appropriate.</p>
<p>Thus, the focus is shifted to decisions: Would the same decision about practical action be appropriate if the coin produces heads 0.500,000,000,1 of the time as if it produces heads 0.5 of the time precisely? Does it matter whether the coin produces heads 0.5 of the time or 0.6 of the time, and if so does it matter enough to be worth the cost of the data needed to decide between the actions appropriate to these situations? Questions such as these carry us toward a comprehensive theory of rational action, in which the consequences of each possible action are weighed in the light of each possible state of reality. The value of a correct decision, or the costs of various degrees of error, are then balanced against the costs of reducing the risks of error by collecting further data. It is this viewpoint that underlies the definition of statistics given in the first sentence of this book.

<p>Siegel does not explain why his interest is confined to tests of significance; to make measurements and then ignore their magnitudes would ordinarily be pointless. Exclusive reliance on tests of significance obscures the fact that statistical-significance does not imply substantive significance. The tests given by Siegel apply only to null hypotheses of “no difference.” In research, however, null hypotheses of the form “Population A has a median at least 5 units <em>larger</em> than the median of Population B” arise. Null hypotheses of no difference are usually known to be false before the data are collected [<a href="#fisher-1956" title="_Statistical Methods and Scientific Inference_, pg42 (R. A.

<blockquote>
<p>The most misused and misconceived hypothesis-testing model employed in psychology is referred to as the “null-hypothesis” model. Stating it crudely, one null hypothesis would be that two treatments do not produce different mean effects in the long run. Using the obtained means and sample estimates of”population” variances, probability statements can be made about the acceptance or rejection of the null hypothesis. Similar null hypotheses are applied to correlations, complex experimental designs, factor-analytic results, and most all experimental results.</p>
<p>Although from a mathematical point of view the null-hypothesis models are internally neat, they share a crippling flaw: in the real world the null hypothesis is almost never true, and it is usually nonsensical to perform an experiment with the <em>sole</em> aim of rejecting the null hypothesis. This is a personal point of view, and it cannot be proved directly. However, it is supported both by common sense and by practical experience. The common-sense argument is that different psychological treatments will almost always (in the long run) produce differences in mean effects, even though the differences may be very small. Also, just as nature abhors a vacuum, it probably abhors zero correlations between variables.</p>
<p>…Experience shows that when large numbers of subjects are used in studies, nearly all comparisons of means are “significantly” different and all correlations are “significantly” different from zero. The author once had occasion to use 700 subjects in a study of public opinion. After a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_analysis" id="_dUO1Hqah" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_analysis#bodyContent" title="Factor analysis">factor analysis</a> of the results, the factors were correlated with individual-difference variables such as amount of education, age, income, sex, and others. In looking at the results I was happy to find so many “significant” correlations (under the null-hypothesis model)-indeed, nearly all correlations were significant, including ones that made little sense. Of course, with an <em>N</em> of 700 correlations as large as 0.08 are “beyond the 0.05 level.” Many of the “significant” correlations were of no theoretical or practical importance.</p>
<p>The point of view taken here is that if the null hypothesis is not rejected, it usually is because the <em>N</em> is too small. If enough data is gathered, the hypothesis will generally be rejected. If rejection of the null hypothesis were the real intention in psychological experiments, there usually would be no need to gather data.</p>
<p>…Statisticians are not to blame for the misconceptions in psychology about the use of statistical methods. They have warned us about the use of the hypothesis-testing models and the related concepts. In particular they have criticized the null-hypothesis model and have recommended alternative procedures similar to those recommended here (See <a href="#savage-1957">Savage, 1957</a>; <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/statistics/decision/1954-tukey.pdf" id="tukey-1954" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-link-icon-color="#f40f02" data-filesize-bytes="1207818" data-filesize-percentage="77" title="Unsolved Problems of Experimental Statistics">Tukey, 1954</a>; and <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/statistics/causality/1951-yates.pdf" id="yates-1951" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-link-icon-color="#f40f02" data-filesize-bytes="950352" data-filesize-percentage="73" title="The Influence of Statistical Methods for Research Workers on the Development of the Science of Statistics">Yates, 1951</a>).</p>

<p>However, it is interesting to look at this book from another angle. Here we have set before us with great clarity a panorama of modern statistical methods, as used in biology, medicine, physical science, social and mental science, and industry. How far does this show that these methods fulfil their aims of analysing the data reliably, and how many gaps are there still in our knowledge?…One feature which can puzzle an outsider, and which requires much more justification than is usually given, is the setting up of unplausible null hypotheses. For example, a statistician may set out a test to see whether two drugs have exactly the same effect, or whether a regression line is exactly straight. These hypotheses can scarcely be taken literally, but a statistician may say, quite reasonably, that he wishes to test whether there is an appreciable difference between the effects of the two drugs, or an appreciable curvature in the regression line. But this raises at once the question: how large is ‘appreciable’? Or in other words, are we not really concerned with some kind of estimation, rather than significance?</p>

<p>The most popular notion of a test is, roughly, a tentative decision between two hypotheses on the basis of data, and this is the notion that will dominate the present treatment of tests. Some qualification is needed if only because, in typical applications, one of the hypotheses—the null hypothesis—is known by all concerned to be false from the outset (<a href="#berkson-1938" title="Some difficulties of interpretation encountered in the application of the chi-square test"><span><span>Berkson</span><span>1938</span></span></a>; <a href="#hodges-lehmann-1954" title="Testing the approximate validity of statistical hypotheses"><span><span>Hodges &amp; Lehmann</span><span>1954</span></span></a>; <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/statistics/decision/1959-lehmann-testingstatisticalhypotheses.pdf" id="lehmann-1959" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-link-icon-color="#f40f02" data-filesize-bytes="6805671" data-filesize-percentage="93" title="_Testing Statistical Hypotheses_"><span><span>Lehmann</span><span>1959</span></span></a><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>; <a href="#savage-1957">I.

<blockquote>
<p>Let us consider some of the difficulties associated with the null hypothesis.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The <em>a priori</em> reasons for believing that the null hypothesis is generally false anyway. One of the common experiences of research workers is the very high frequency with which significant results are obtained with large samples. Some years ago, the author had occasion to run a number of tests of significance on a battery of tests collected on about 60,000 subjects from all over the United States. Every test came out significant. Dividing the cards by such arbitrary criteria as east versus west of the Mississippi River, Maine versus the rest of the country, North versus South, etc., all produced significant differences in means. In some instances, the differences in the sample means were quite small, but nonetheless, the <em>p</em> values were all very low. <a href="#nunnally-1960"><span><span>Nunnally</span><span>1960</span></span></a> has reported a similar experience involving correlation coefficients on 700 subjects. <a href="#berkson-1938" title="Some difficulties of interpretation encountered in the application of the chi-square test">Joseph <span><span>Berkson</span><span>1938</span></span></a> made the observation almost 30 years in connection with chi-square:</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe that an observant statistician who has had any considerable experience with applying the chi-square test repeatedly will agree with my statement that, as a matter of observation, when the numbers in the data are quite large, the P’s tend to come out small. Having observed this, and on reflection, I make the following dogmatic statement, referring for illustration to the normal curve: “If the normal curve is fitted to a body of data representing any real observations whatever of quantities in the physical world, then if the number of observations is extremely large—for instance, on an order of 200,000—the chi-square <em>p</em> will be small beyond any usual limit of significance.”</p>
<p>This dogmatic statement is made on the basis of an extrapolation of the observation referred to and can also be defended as a prediction from <em>a priori</em> considerations. For we may assume that it is practically certain that any series of real observations does not actually follow a normal curve <em>with absolute exactitude</em> in all respects, and no matter how small the discrepancy between the normal curve and the true curve of observations, the chi-square <em>P</em> will be small if the sample has a sufficiently large number of observations in it.</p>
<p>If this be so, then we have something here that is apt to trouble the conscience of a reflective statistician using the chi-square test. For I suppose it would be agreed by statisticians that a large sample is always better than a small sample. If, then, we know in advance the <em>P</em> that will result from an application of a chi-square test to a large sample, there would seem to be no use in doing it on a smaller one. But since the result of the former test is known, it is no test at all [pp.&nbsp;526–527].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As one group of authors has put it, “in typical applications . . . the null hypothesis . . . is known by all concerned to be false from the outset [<a href="#edwards-1963"><span><span title="et al">Edwards</span><span> et al </span><span>1963</span></span></a>, p.&nbsp;214].” The fact of the matter is that <em>there is really no good reason to expect the null hypothesis to be true in any population.</em> Why should the mean, say, of all scores east of the Mississippi be <em>identical</em> to all scores west of the Mississippi? Why should any correlation coefficient be <em>exactly</em> 0.00 in the population? Why should we expect the ratio of males to females be <em>exactly</em> 50:50 in any population? Or why should different drugs have <em>exactly</em> the same effect on any population parameter (<a href="#smith-1960"><span><span>Smith</span><span>1960</span></span></a>)? <em>A glance at any set of statistics on total populations will quickly confirm the rarity of the null hypothesis in nature.</em></p>
<p>…Should there be any deviation from the null hypothesis in the population, <em>no matter how small</em>—and we have little doubt but that such a deviation usually exists—a sufficiently large number of observations will lead to the rejection of the null hypothesis. As <span><span>Nunnally</span><span>1960</span></span> put it,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if the null hypothesis is not rejected, it is usually because the <em>N</em> is too small. If enough data are gathered, the hypothesis will generally be rejected. If rejection of the null hypothesis were the real intention in psychological experiments, there usually would be no need to gather data [p.&nbsp;643].</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One reason why the directional null hypothesis (<em>H</em><sub>02</sub>: μ<sub>g</sub> ≤ μ<sub>b</sub>) is the appropriate candidate for experimental refutation is the universal agreement that the old point-null hypothesis (<em>H</em><sub>0</sub>: μ<sub>g</sub> = μ<sub>b</sub>) is [quasi-] always false in biological and social science. Any dependent variable of interest, such as I.Q., or academic achievement, or perceptual speed, or emotional reactivity as measured by skin resistance, or whatever, depends mainly upon a finite number of “strong” variables characteristic of the organisms studied (embodying the accumulated results of their genetic makeup and their learning histories) plus the influences manipulated by the experimenter. Upon some complicated, unknown mathematical function of this finite list of “important” determiners is then superimposed an indefinitely large number of essentially “random” factors which contribute to the intragroup variation and therefore boost the error term of the statistical-significance test. In order for two groups which differ in some identified properties (such as social class, intelligence, diagnosis, racial or religious background) to differ not at all in the “output” variable of interest, it would be necessary that all determiners of the output variable have precisely the same average values in both groups, or else that their values should differ by a <em>pattern of amounts of difference</em> which precisely counterbalance one another to yield a net difference of zero. Now our general background knowledge in the social sciences, or, for that matter, even “common sense” considerations, makes such an exact equality of all determining variables, or a precise “accidental” counterbalancing of them, so extremely unlikely that no psychologist or statistician would assign more than a negligibly small probability to such a state of affairs.</p>
<p>…<em>Example</em>: Suppose we are studying a simple perceptual-verbal task like rate of color-naming in school children, and the independent variable is father’s religious preference. Superficial consideration might suggest that these two variables would not be related, but a little thought leads one to conclude that they will almost certainly be related by <em>some</em> amount, however small. Consider, for instance, that a child’s reaction to any sort of school-context task will be to some extent dependent upon his social class, since the desire to please academic personnel and the desire to achieve at a performance (just because it is a <em>task</em>, regardless of its intrinsic interest) are both related to the kinds of sub-cultural and personality traits in the parents that lead to upward mobility, economic success, the gaining of further education, and the like. Again, since there is known to be a sex difference in color naming, it is likely that fathers who have entered occupations more attractive to “feminine” males will (on the average) provide a somewhat more feminine father figure for identification on the part of their male offspring, and that a more refined color vocabulary, making closer discriminations between similar hues, will be characteristic of the ordinary language of such a household. Further, it is known that there is a correlation between a child’s general intelligence and its father’s occupation, and of course there will be <em>some</em> relation, even though it may be small, between a child’s general intelligence and his color vocabulary, arising from the fact that <em>vocabulary in general</em> is heavily saturated with the general intelligence factor. Since religious preference is a correlate of social class, all of these social class factors, as well as the intelligence variable, would tend to influence color-naming performance. Or consider a more extreme and faint kind of relationship. It is quite conceivable that a child who belongs to a more liturgical religious denomination would be somewhat more color-oriented than a child for whom bright colors were not associated with the religious life. Everyone familiar with psychological research knows that numerous “puzzling, unexpected” correlations pop up all the time, and that it requires only a moderate amount of motivation-plus-ingenuity to construct very plausible alternative theoretical explanations for them.</p>
<p>…These armchair considerations are borne out by the finding that in psychological and sociological investigations involving very large numbers of subjects, it is regularly found that almost all correlations or differences between means are statistically-significant. See, for example, the papers by <a href="#bakan-1966" title="The test of significance in psychological research"><span><span>Bakan</span><span>1966</span></span></a> and <a href="#nunnally-1960"><span><span>Nunnally</span><span>1960</span></span></a>. Data currently being analyzed by Dr.&nbsp;David Lykken and myself<a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>, derived from a huge sample of over 55,000 Minnesota high school seniors, reveal statistically-significant relationships in 91% of pairwise associations among a congeries of 45 miscellaneous variables such as sex, birth order, religious preference, number of siblings, vocational choice, club membership, college choice, mother’s education, dancing, interest in woodworking, liking for school, and the like. The 9% of non-statistically-significant associations are heavily concentrated among a small minority of variables having dubious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)" id="_T1eYyggy" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(statistics)#bodyContent" title="Reliability (statistics)">reliability</a>, or involving arbitrary groupings of non-homogeneous or nonmonotonic sub-categories. The majority of variables exhibited significant relationships <em>with all but 3 of the others</em>, often at a very high confidence level (<em>p</em> &lt; 10<sup>−6</sup>).</p>
<p>…Considering the fact that “everything in the brain is connected with everything else”, and that there exist several “general state-variables” (such as arousal, attention, anxiety, and the like) which are known to be at least <em>slightly</em> influenceable by practically any kind of stimulus input, it is highly unlikely that <em>any</em> psychologically discriminable stimulation which we apply to an experimental subject would exert literally <em>zero</em> effect upon any aspect of his performance. The psychological literature abounds with examples of small but detectable influences of this kind. Thus it is known that if a subject memorizes a list of nonsense syllables in the presence of a faint odor of peppermint, his recall will be facilitated by the presence of that odor. Or, again, we know that individuals solving intellectual problems in a “messy” room do not perform quite as well as individuals working in a neat, well-ordered surround. Again, cognitive processes undergo a detectable facilitation when the thinking subject is concurrently performing the irrelevant, noncognitive task of squeezing a hand dynamometer. It would require considerable ingenuity to concoct experimental manipulations, except the most minimal and trivial (such as a very slight modification in the word order of instructions given a subject) where one could have confidence that the manipulation would be utterly without effect upon the subject’s motivational level, attention, arousal, fear of failure, achievement drive, desire to please the experimenter, distraction, social fear, etc., etc. So that, for example, while there is no very “interesting” psychological theory that links hunger drive with color-naming ability, I myself would confidently predict a significant difference in color-naming ability between persons tested after a full meal and persons who had not eaten for 10 hours, provided the sample size were sufficiently large and the color-naming measurements sufficiently reliable, since one of the effects of the increased hunger drive is heightened “arousal”, and anything which heightens arousal would be expected to affect a perceptual-cognitive performance like color-naming. Suffice it to say that there are very good reasons for expecting at least <em>some</em> slight influence of almost any experimental manipulation which would differ sufficiently in its form and content from the manipulation imposed upon a control group to be included in an experiment in the first place. In what follows I shall therefore assume that the point-null hypothesis <em>H</em><sub>0</sub> is, in psychology, [quasi-] always false.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most theories in the areas of personality, clinical, and social psychology predict no more than the direction of a correlation, group difference, or treatment effect. Since the null hypothesis is never strictly true, such predictions have about a 50-50 chance of being confirmed by experiment when the theory in question is false, since the statistical-significance of the result is a function of the sample size.</p>
<p>…Most psychological experiments are of 3 kinds: (1) studies of the effect of some treatment on some output variables, which can be regarded as a special case of (2) studies of the difference between two or more groups of individuals with respect to some variable, which in turn are a special case of (3) the study of the relationship or correlation between two or more variables within some specified population. Using the bivariate correlation design as paradigmatic, then, one notes first that the strict null hypothesis must always be assumed to be false (this idea is not new and has recently been illuminated by <a href="#bakan-1966"><span><span>Bakan</span><span>1966</span></span></a>). Unless one of the variables is wholly unreliable so that the values obtained are strictly random, it would be foolish to suppose that the correlation between any two variables is identically equal to 0.0000 . . . (or that the effect of some treatment or the difference between two groups is exactly <em>zero</em>). The molar dependent variables employed in psychological research are extremely complicated in the sense that the measured value of such a variable tends to be affected by the interaction of a vast number of factors, both in the present situation and in the history of the subject organism. It is exceedingly unlikely that any two such variables will not share at least some of these factors and equally unlikely that their effects will exactly cancel one another out.</p>
<p>It might be argued that the more complex the variables the smaller their average correlation ought to be since a larger pool of common factors allows more chance for mutual cancellation of effects in obedience to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers" id="_c2MypS07" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers#bodyContent" title="Law of large numbers">Law of Large Numbers</a><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>. However, one knows of a number of unusually potent and pervasive factors which operate to unbalance such convenient symmetries and to produce correlations large enough to rival the effects of whatever causal factors the experimenter may have had in mind. Thus, we know that (1) “good” psychological and physical variables tend to be positively correlated; (6) experimenters, without deliberate intention, can somehow subtly bias their findings in the expected direction (Rosenthal, <span>1963<sub><span title="1963 was 62 years ago.">62ya</span></sub></span>); (3) the effects of common method are often as strong as or stronger than those produced by the actual variables of interest (eg. in a large and careful study of the factorial structure of adjustment to stress among officer candidates, Holtzman &amp; Bitterman, <span>1956<sub><span title="1956 was 69 years ago.">69ya</span></sub></span>, found that their 101 original variables contained 5 main common factors representing, respectively, their rating scales, their perceptual-motor tests, the McKinney Reporting Test, their GSR variables, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Multiphasic_Personality_Inventory" id="_Tr4qHl-1" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Multiphasic_Personality_Inventory#bodyContent" title="Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory">MMPI</a>); (4) transitory state variables such as the subject’s anxiety level, fatigue, or his desire to please, may broadly affect all measures obtained in a single experimental session. This average shared variance of “unrelated” variables can be thought of as a kind of ambient noise level characteristic of the domain. It would be interesting to obtain empirical estimates of this quantity in our field to serve as a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterline" id="_5xRFcnIp" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterline#bodyContent" title="Waterline">Plimsoll mark</a> against which to compare obtained relationships predicted by some theory under test. If, as I think, it is not unreasonable to suppose that “unrelated” molar psychological variables share on the average about 4% to 5% of common variance, then the expected correlation between any such variables would be about 0.20 in absolute value and the expected difference between any two groups on some such variable would be nearly 0.5 standard deviation units. (Note that these estimates assume zero measurement error. One can better explain the near-zero correlations often observed in psychological research in terms of unreliability of measures than in terms of the assumption that the true scores are in fact unrelated.)</p>

<p>There are 3 main factors or types of variables that seem likely to have an important influence on ability and school achievement. These are (1) the school factor or organized educational influences; (2) the family factor or all of the social influences of family life on a child; and (3) the genetic factor…the separation of the effects of the major types of influences has proved to be extraordinarily difficult, and all of the research so far has not resulted in a clear-cut conclusion.</p>
<p>…This messy situation is due primarily to the fact that in human society all good things tend to go together. The most intelligent parents—those with the best genetic potential—also tend to provide the most comfortable and intellectually stimulating home environments for their children, and also tend to send their children to the most affluent and well-equipped schools. Thus, the ubiquitous correlation between family socio-economic status and school achievement is ambiguous in meaning, and isolating the independent contribution of the factors involved is difficult. However, the strong emotionally motivated attitudes and vested interests in this area have also tended to inhibit the sort of dispassionate, objective evaluation of the available evidence that is necessary for the advance of science.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>10.19: Testmanship, or how big is a difference?</p>
<p>…As we saw in Chapter 4, the complete absence of a statistical relation, or no association, occurs only when the conditional distribution of the dependent variable is the same regardless of which treatment is administered. Thus if the independent variable is not associated at all with the dependent variable the population distributions must be identical over the treatments. If, on the other hand, the means of the different treatment populations are different, the conditional distributions themselves must be different and the independent and dependent variables must be associated. The rejection of the hypothesis of no difference between population means is tantamount to the assertion that the treatment given does have some statistical association with the dependent variable score.</p>
<p>…However, the occurrence of a significant result says nothing at all about the strength of the association between treatment and score. A significant result leads to the inference that some association exists, but in no sense does this mean that an important degree of association necessarily exists. Conversely, evidence of a strong statistical association can occur in data even when the results are not significant. The game of inferring the true degree of statistical association has a joker: this is the sample size. The time has come to define the notion of the strength of a statistical association more sharply, and to link this idea with that of the true difference between population means.</p>
<p>. When does it seem appropriate to say that a strong association exists between the experimental factor <em>X</em> and the dependent variable <em>Y</em>? Over all of the different possibilities for <em>X</em> there is a probability distribution of <em>Y</em> values, which is the marginal distribution of <em>Y</em> over (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) events. The existence of this distribution implies that we do not know exactly what the <em>Y</em> value for any observation will be; we are always uncertain about <em>Y</em> to some extent. However, given any particular <em>X</em>, there is also a conditional distribution of <em>Y</em>, and it may be that in this conditional distribution the highly probable values of <em>Y</em> tend to “shrink” within a much narrower range than in the marginal distribution. If so, we can say that the information about <em>X</em> tends to reduce uncertainty about <em>Y</em>. <strong>In general we will say that the strength of a statistical relation is reflected by the extent to which knowing <em>X</em> reduces uncertainty about <em>Y</em>.</strong> One of the best indicators of our uncertainty about the value of a variable is σ<sup>2</sup>, the variance of its distribution…This index reflects the predictive power afforded by a relationship: when <em>w</em><sup>2</sup> is zero, then <em>X</em> does not aid us at all in predicting the value of <em>Y</em>. On the other hand, when <em>w</em><sup>2</sup> is 1.00, this tells us that <em>X</em> lets us know <em>Y</em> exactly…About now you should be wondering what the index <em>w</em><sup>2</sup> has to do with the difference between population means.</p>
<p>…When the difference <em>u</em><sub>1</sub> - <em>u</em><sub>2</sub> is zero, then <em>w</em><sup>2</sup> must be zero. In the usual <em>t</em>-test for a difference, the hypothesis of no difference between means is equivalent to the hypothesis that <em>w</em><sup>2</sup> = 0. On the other hand, when there is any difference at all between population means, the value of <em>w</em><sup>2</sup> must be greater than 0. In short, a true difference is “big” in the sense of predictive power only if the square of that difference is large relative to <span><span><span><span aria-label="\sigma^2_Y"></span></span></span></span>. However, in significance tests such as <em>t</em>, we compare the difference we get with an estimate of σ<sub>diff</sub>. The standard error of the difference can be made almost as small as we choose if we are given a free choice of sample size. Unless sample size is specified, there is no <em>necessary</em> connection between significance and the true strength of association.</p>
<p>This points up the fallacy of evaluating the “goodness” of a result in terms of statistical-significance alone, without allowing for the sample size used. All significant results do not imply the same degree of true association between independent and dependent variables.</p>
<p>It is sad but true that researchers have been known to capitalize on this fact. There is a certain amount of “testmanship” involved in using inferential statistics. <em>Virtually any study can be made to show significant results if one uses enough subjects, regardless of how nonsensical the content may be.</em> There is surely nothing on earth that is completely independent of anything else. The strength of an association may approach zero, but it should seldom or never be exactly zero. If one applies a large enough sample of the study of any relation, trivial or meaningless as it may be, sooner or later he is almost certain to achieve a significant result. Such a result may be a valid finding, but only in the sense that one can say with assurance that some association is not exactly zero. The degree to which such a finding enhances our knowledge is debatable. If the criterion of strength of association is applied to such a result, it becomes obvious that little or nothing is actually contributed to our ability to predict one thing from another.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that two methods of teaching first grade children to read are being compared. A random sample of 1000 children are taught to read by method I, another sample of 1000 children by method II. The results of the instruction are evaluated by a test that provides a score, in whole units, for each child. Suppose that the results turned out as follows:</p>
<div>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><p>Method I</p></th>
<th><p>Method II</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p><em>M</em><sub>1</sub> = 147.21</p></td>
<td><p><em>M</em><sub>2</sub> = 147.64</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p><em>N</em><sub>1</sub> = 1000</p></td>
<td><p><em>N</em><sub>2</sub> = 1000</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>Then, the estimated standard error of the difference is about 0.145, and the <em>z</em> value is</p>

<p>This certainly permits rejection of the null hypothesis of no difference between the groups. However, does it really tell us very much about what to expect of an individual child’s score on the test, given the information that he was taught by method I or method II? If we look at the group of children taught by method II, and assume that the distribution of their scores is approximately normal, we find that about 45% of these children fall <em>below</em> the mean score for children in group I. Similarly, about 45% of children in group I fall above the mean score for group II. Although the difference between the two groups is significant, the two groups actually overlap a great deal in terms of their performances on the test. In this sense, the two groups are really not very different at all, even though the difference between the means is quite significant in a purely statistical sense.</p>
<p>Putting the matter in a slightly different way, we note that the grand mean of the two groups is 147.425. Thus, our best bet about the score of any child, not knowing the method of his training, is 147.425. If we guessed that any child drawn at random from the combined group should have a score above 147.425, we should be wrong about half the time. However, among the original groups, according to method I and method II, the proportions falling above and below this grand mean are approximately as follows:</p>
<div>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th><p>Below 147.425</p></th>
<th><p>Above 147.425</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p>Method I</p></td>
<td><p>0.51</p></td>
<td><p>0.49</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Method II</p></td>
<td><p>0.49</p></td>
<td><p>0.51</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>This implies that if we know a child is from group I, and we guess that this score is below the grand mean, then we will be wrong about 49% of the time. Similarly, if a child is from group II, and we guess his score to be above the grand mean, we will be wrong about 49% of the time. If we are not given the group to which the child belongs, ad we guess either above or below the grand mean, we will be wrong about 50% of the time. Knowing the group does reduce the probability of error in such a guess, but it does not reduce it very much. The method by which the child was trained simply doesn’t tell us a great deal about what the child’s score will be, even though the difference in mean scores is significant in the statistical sense.</p>
<p>This kind of testmanship flourishes best when people pay too much attention to the significance test and too little to the degree of statistical association the finding represents. This clutters up the literature with findings that are often not worth pursuing, and which serve only to obscure the really important predictive relations that occasionally appear. The serious scientist owes it to himself and his readers to ask not only, “Is there any association between <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>?” but also, “How much does my finding suggest about the power to predict <em>Y</em> from <em>X</em>?” Much too much emphasis is paid to the former, at the expense of the latter, question.</p>

The questions investigated included how twins are similar to or different from non-twins, how identical twins are similar to or different from fraternal twins, how the personalities and interests of twins reflect genetic factors, how the personalities and interests of twins reflect early environmental factors, and what implications these questions have for the general issue of how heredity and environment influence the development of psychological characteristics. In attempting to answer these questions, the authors shed light on the importance of both genes and environment and form the basis for different approaches in behavior genetic research.</p>

<p>Since the null hypothesis is quasi-always false, tables summarizing research in terms of patterns of “significant differences” are little more than complex, causally uninterpretable outcomes of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_a_test" id="_4HjKZF87" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_a_test#bodyContent" title="Statistical power">statistical power</a> functions.</p>
<p>The kinds of theories and the kinds of theoretical risks to which we put them in soft psychology when we use significance testing as our method are <em>not</em> like testing Meehl’s theory of weather by seeing how well it forecasts the number of inches it will rain on certain days. Instead, they are depressingly close to testing the theory by seeing whether it rains in April at all, or rains several days in April, or rains in April more than in May. It happens mainly because, as I believe is generally recognized by statisticians today and by thoughtful social scientists, the null hypothesis, taken literally, is always false. I shall not attempt to document this here, because among sophisticated persons it is taken for granted. (See Morrison &amp; Henkel, <span>1970<sub><span title="1970 was 55 years ago.">55ya</span></sub></span> [<em>The Significance Test Controversy: A Reader</em>], especially the chapters by <a href="#bakan-1966">Bakan</a>, Hogben, <a href="#lykken-1968">Lykken</a>, <a href="#meehl-1967">Meehl</a>, and <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/www/pdfs.semanticscholar.org/40448a28b9470a20f382cedee2b3fd9b6ccb1c41.pdf" id="rozeboom-1960" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-link-icon-color="#f40f02" data-url-archive="/doc/www/pdfs.semanticscholar.org/40448a28b9470a20f382cedee2b3fd9b6ccb1c41.pdf" data-url-original="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b596/4787fc1abf739148d604abfbd2689e73e52f.pdf" data-filesize-bytes="653742" data-filesize-percentage="40" title="The fallacy of the null-hypothesis significance test">Rozeboom</a>.) A little reflection shows us why it has to be the case, since an output variable such as adult IQ, or academic achievement, or effectiveness at communication, or whatever, will always, in the social sciences, be a function of a sizable but finite number of factors. (The smallest contributions may be considered as essentially a random variance term.) In order for two groups (males and females, or whites and blacks, or manic depressives and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia" id="_Gh5HccJm" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia#bodyContent" title="Schizophrenia">schizophrenics</a>, or Republicans and Democrats) to be <em>exactly</em> equal on such an output variable, we have to imagine that they are exactly equal <em>or</em> delicately counterbalanced on all of the contributors in the causal equation, which will never be the case.</p>
<p>Following the general line of reasoning (presented by myself and several others over the last decade), from the fact that the null hypothesis is always false in soft psychology, it follows that the probability of refuting it depends wholly on the sensitivity of the experiment—its logical design, the net (attenuated) construct validity of the measures, and, most importantly, the sample size, which determines where we are on the statistical power function. Putting it crudely, if you have enough cases and your measures are not totally unreliable, the null hypothesis will always be falsified, <em>regardless of the truth of the substantive theory</em>. Of course, it could be falsified in the wrong direction, which means that as the power improves, the probability of a corroborative result approaches one-half. However, if the theory has no verisimilitude—such that we can imagine, so to speak, picking our empirical results randomly out of a directional hat apart from any theory—the probability of refuting by getting a significant difference in the wrong direction also approaches one-half. Obviously, this is quite unlike the situation desired from either a Bayesian, a Popperian, or a commonsense scientific standpoint. As I have pointed out elsewhere (<a href="#meehl-1967">Meehl, 1967</a>/<span>1970<sub><span title="1970 was 55 years ago.">55ya</span></sub></span>b; but see criticism by <a href="#oakes-1975">Oakes, 1975</a>; <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/statistics/causality/1973-keuth.pdf" id="keuth-1973" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-link-icon-color="#f40f02" data-filesize-bytes="437871" data-filesize-percentage="55" title="On prior probabilities of rejecting statistical hypotheses">Keuth, 1973</a>; and rebuttal by <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/statistics/causality/1975-swoyer.pdf" id="swoyer-monson-1975" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-link-icon-color="#f40f02" data-filesize-bytes="346599" data-filesize-percentage="49" title="Theory confirmation in psychology">Swoyer &amp; Monson, 1975</a>), an improvement in instrumentation or other sources of experimental accuracy tends, in physics or astronomy or chemistry or genetics, to subject the theory to a greater risk of refutation <em>modus tollens</em>, whereas improved precision in null hypothesis testing usually decreases this risk. A successful significance test of a substantive theory in soft psychology provides a feeble corroboration of the theory because the procedure has subjected the theory to a feeble risk.</p>
<p>…I am not making some nit-picking statistician’s correction. I am saying that the whole business is so radically defective as to be scientifically almost pointless… I am making a philosophical complaint or, if you prefer, a complaint in the domain of scientific method. I suggest that when a reviewer tries to “make theoretical sense” out of such a table of favorable and adverse significance test results, what the reviewer is actually engaged in, willy-nilly or unwittingly, is meaningless substantive constructions on the properties of the statistical power function, and almost nothing else.</p>
<p>…You may say, “But, Meehl, R. A. Fisher was a genius, and we all know how valuable his stuff has been in agronomy. Why shouldn’t it work for soft psychology?” Well, I am not intimidated by Fisher’s genius, because my complaint is not in the field of mathematical statistics, and as regards inductive logic and philosophy of science, it is well-known that Sir Ronald permitted himself a great deal of dogmatism. I remember my amazement when the late <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Carnap" id="_R973FqQu" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Carnap#bodyContent" title="Rudolf Carnap">Rudolf Carnap</a> said to me, the first time I met him, “But, of course, on this subject Fisher is just mistaken: surely you must know that.” My statistician friends tell me that it is not clear just how useful the significance test has been in biological science either, but I set that aside as beyond my competence to discuss.</p>

<p><strong>Relative Importance Of These 3 Measures</strong>. It is a matter of some debate as to which of these 3 measures [σ<sup>2</sup>/<em>p</em>/R<sup>2</sup>] we should pay the most attention to in an experiment. It’s our opinion that finding a “significant effect” really provides very little information because it’s almost certainly true that <em>some</em> relationship (however small) exists between <em>any</em> two variables. And in general <em>finding</em> a significant effect simply means that enough observations have been collected in the experiment to make the statistical test of the experiment powerful enough to detect whatever effect there is. The smaller the effect, the more powerful the experiments needs to be of course, but no matter how small the effect, it’s always possible in principle to design an experiment sufficiently powerful to detect it. We saw a striking example of this principle in the office hours experiment. In this experiment there was a relationship between the two variables—and since there were so many subjects in the experiment (that is, since the test was so powerful), this relationship was revealed in the statistical analysis. But was it anything to write home about? Certainly not. In any sort of practical context the size of the effect, although nonzero, is so small it can almost be ignored.</p>
<p>It is our judgment that accounting for variance is really much more meaningful than testing for significance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Problem 6. <em>Crud factor</em>: In the social sciences and arguably in the biological sciences, “everything correlates to some extent with everything else.” This truism, which I have found no competent psychologist disputes given 5 minutes reflection, does not apply to pure experimental studies in which attributes that the subjects bring with them are not the subject of study (except in so far as they appear as a source of error and hence in the denominator of a significance test).<sup>6</sup> There is nothing mysterious about the fact that in psychology and sociology everything correlates with everything. Any measured trait or attribute is some function of a list of partly known and mostly unknown causal factors in the genes and life history of the individual, and both genetic and environmental factors are known from tons of empirical research to be themselves correlated. To take an extreme case, suppose we construe the null hypothesis literally (objecting that we mean by it “almost null” gets ahead of the story, and destroys the rigor of the Fisherian mathematics!) and ask whether we expect males and females in Minnesota to be precisely equal in some arbitrary trait that has individual differences, say, color naming. In the case of color naming we could think of some obvious differences right off, but even if we didn’t know about them, what is the causal situation? If we write a causal equation (which is not the same as a regression equation for pure predictive purposes but which, if we had it, would serve better than the latter) so that the score of an individual male is some function (presumably nonlinear if we knew enough about it but here supposed linear for simplicity) of a rather long set of causal variables of genetic and environmental type <em>X</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>X</em><sub>2</sub>, … <em>X</em><sub>m</sub>. These values are operated upon by regression coefficients <em>b</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>b</em><sub>2</sub>, …<em>b</em><sub>m</sub>.</p>
<p>…Now we write a similar equation for the class of females. Can anyone suppose that the beta coefficients for the two sexes will be exactly the same? Can anyone imagine that the mean values of all of the <em>X</em>s will be exactly the same for males and females, even if the culture were not still considerably sexist in child-rearing practices and the like? If the betas are not exactly the same for the two sexes, and the mean values of the <em>X</em>s are not exactly the same, what kind of Leibnitzian preestablished harmony would we have to imagine in order for the mean color-naming score to come out exactly equal between males and females? It boggles the mind; it simply would never happen. As Einstein said, “the Lord God is subtle, but He is not malicious.” We cannot imagine that nature is out to fool us by this kind of delicate balancing. Anybody familiar with large scale research data takes it as a matter of course that when the <em>N</em> gets big enough she will not be looking for the statistically-significant correlations but rather looking at their patterns, since almost all of them will be significant. In saying this, I am not going counter to what is stated by mathematical statisticians or psychologists with statistical expertise. For example, the standard psychologist’s textbook, the excellent treatment by Hays (<a href="#hays-1973">1973, page 415</a>), explicitly states that, taken literally, the null hypothesis is always false.</p>
<p>20 ago David Lykken and I conducted an exploratory study of the crud factor which we never published but I shall summarize it briefly here. (I offer it not as “empirical proof”—that <em>H</em><sub>0</sub> taken literally is quasi-always false hardly needs proof and is generally admitted—but as a punchy and somewhat amusing example of an insufficiently appreciated truth about soft correlational psychology.) In <span>1966<sub><span title="1966 was 59 years ago.">59ya</span></sub></span>, the University of Minnesota Student Counseling Bureau’s Statewide Testing Program administered a questionnaire to 57,000 high school seniors, the items dealing with family facts, attitudes toward school, vocational and educational plans, leisure time activities, school organizations, etc. We cross-tabulated a total of 15 (and then 45) variables including the following (the number of categories for each variable given in parentheses): father’s occupation (7), father’s education (9), mother’s education (9), number of siblings (10), birth order (only, oldest, youngest, neither), educational plans after high school (3), family attitudes towards college (3), do you like school (3), sex (2), college choice (7), occupational plan in 10 years (20), and religious preference (20). In addition, there were 22 “leisure time activities” such as “acting”, “model building”, “cooking”, etc., which could be treated either as a single 22-category variable or as 22 dichotomous variables. There were also 10 “high school organizations” such as “school subject clubs”, “farm youth groups”, “political clubs”, etc., which also could be treated either as a single ten-category variable or as 10 dichotomous variables. Considering the latter two variables as multichotomies gives a total of 15 variables producing 105 different cross-tabulations. All values of χ<sup>2</sup> for these 105 cross-tabulations were statistically-significant, and 101 (96%) of them were significant with a probability of less than 10<sup>−6</sup>.</p>
<p>…If “leisure activity” and “high school organizations” are considered as separate dichotomies, this gives a total of 45 variables and 990 different crosstabulations. Of these, 92% were statistically-significant and more than 78% were significant with a probability less than 10<sup>−6</sup>. Looked at in another way, the median number of significant relationships between a given variable and all the others was 41 out of a possible 44!</p>
<p>We also computed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_College_Admission_Test" id="_RKnM_1Nc" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_College_Admission_Test#bodyContent" title="Medical College Admission Test">MCAT</a> scores by category for the following variables: number of siblings, birth order, sex, occupational plan, and religious preference. Highly significant deviations from chance allocation over categories were found for each of these variables. For example, the females score higher than the males; MCAT score steadily and markedly decreases with increasing numbers of siblings; eldest or only children are statistically-significantly brighter than youngest children; there are marked differences in MCAT scores between those who hope to become nurses and those who hope to become nurses aides, or between those planning to be farmers, engineers, teachers, or physicians; and there are substantial MCAT differences among the various religious groups. We also tabulated the 5 principal Protestant religious denominations (Baptist, Episcopal, Lutheran, Methodist, and Presbyterian) against all the other variables, finding highly significant relationships in most instances. For example, only children are nearly twice as likely to be Presbyterian than Baptist in Minnesota, more than half of the Episcopalians “usually like school” but only 45% of Lutherans do, 55% of Presbyterians feel that their grades reflect their abilities as compared to only 47% of Episcopalians, and Episcopalians are more likely to be male whereas Baptists are more likely to be female. 83% of Baptist children said that they enjoyed dancing as compared to 68% of Lutheran children. More than twice the proportion of Episcopalians plan to attend an out of state college than is true for Baptists, Lutherans, or Methodists. The proportion of Methodists who plan to become conservationists is nearly twice that for Baptists, whereas the proportion of Baptists who plan to become receptionists is nearly twice that for Episcopalians.</p>
<p>In addition, we tabulated the 4 principal Lutheran Synods (Missouri, ALC, LCA, and Wisconsin) against the other variables, again finding highly significant relationships in most cases. Thus, 5.9% of Wisconsin Synod children have no siblings as compared to only 3.4% of Missouri Synod children. 58% of ALC Lutherans are involved in playing a musical instrument or singing as compared to 67% of Missouri Synod Lutherans. 80% of Missouri Synod Lutherans belong to school or political clubs as compared to only 71% of LCA Lutherans. 49% of ALC Lutherans belong to debate, dramatics, or musical organizations in high school as compared to only 40% of Missouri Synod Lutherans. 36% of LCA Lutherans belong to organized non-school youth groups as compared to only 21% of Wisconsin Synod Lutherans. [Preceding text courtesy of D. T. Lykken.]</p>
<p>These relationships are not, I repeat, Type I errors. They are facts about the world, and with <em>N</em> = 57,000 they are pretty stable. Some are theoretically easy to explain, others more difficult, others completely baffling. The “easy” ones have multiple explanations, sometimes competing, usually not. Drawing theories from a pot and associating them whimsically with variable pairs would yield an impressive batch of <em>H</em><sub>0</sub>-refuting “confirmations.”</p>
<p>Another amusing example is the behavior of the items in the 550 items of the MMPI pool with respect to sex. Only 60 items appear on the Mf scale, about the same number that were put into the pool with the hope that they would discriminate femininity. It turned out that over half the items in the scale were not put in the pool for that purpose, and of those that were, a bare majority did the job. Scale derivation was based on item analysis of a small group of criterion cases of male homosexual invert syndrome, a significant difference on a rather small <em>N</em> of Dr.&nbsp;Starke Hathaway’s private patients being then conjoined with the requirement of discriminating between male normals and female normals. When the <em>N</em> becomes very large as in the data published by <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/statistics/causality/1973-wendell-anmmpisourcebook.pdf" id="_AWpWvtby" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-link-icon-color="#f40f02" data-filesize-bytes="42307651" data-filesize-percentage="98">Swenson, Pearson, and Osborne (<span>1973<sub><span title="1973 was 52 years ago.">52ya</span></sub></span>; <em>An MMPI Source Book: Basic Item, Scale, And Pattern Data On 50,000 Medical Patients</em>. Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press.)</a>, approximately 25,000 of each sex tested at the Mayo Clinic over a period of years, it turns out that 507 of the 550 items discriminate the sexes. Thus in a heterogeneous item pool we find only 8% of items failing to show a significant difference on the sex dichotomy. The following are sex-discriminators, the male/female differences ranging from a few percentage points to over 30%:<sup>7</sup></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sometimes when I am not feeling well I am cross.</p></li>
<li><p>I believe there is a Devil and a Hell in afterlife.</p></li>
<li><p>I think nearly anyone would tell a lie to keep out of trouble.</p></li>

<li><p>I am certainly lacking in self-confidence.</p></li>
<li><p>Any man who is able and willing to work hard has a good chance of succeeding.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I invite the reader to guess which direction scores “feminine.” Given this information, I find some items easy to “explain” by one obvious theory, others have competing plausible explanations, still others are baffling.</p>
<p>Note that we are not dealing here with some source of statistical error (the occurrence of random sampling fluctuations). That source of error is limited by the significance level we choose, just as the probability of Type II error is set by initial choice of the statistical power, based upon a pilot study or other antecedent data concerning an expected average difference. Since in social science everything correlates with everything to some extent, due to complex and obscure causal influences, in considering the crud factor we are talking about <em>real</em> differences, <em>real</em> correlations, <em>real</em> trends and patterns for which there is, of course, some true but complicated multivariate causal theory. I am not suggesting that these correlations are fundamentally unexplainable. They would be completely explained if we had the knowledge of Omniscient Jones, which we don’t. The point is that we are in the weak situation of corroborating our particular substantive theory by showing that <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> are “related in a nonchance manner”, when our theory is too weak to make a numerical prediction or even (usually) to set up a range of admissible values that would be counted as corroborative.</p>
<p>…Some psychologists play down the influence of the ubiquitous crud factor, what <a href="#lykken-1968" title="Statistical-Significance in Psychological Research">David Lykken (<span>1968<sub><span title="1968 was 57 years ago.">57ya</span></sub></span>)</a> calls the “ambient correlational noise” in social science, by saying that we are not in danger of being misled by small differences that show up as significant in gigantic samples. How much that softens the blow of the crud factor’s influence depends upon the crud factor’s average size in a given research domain, about which neither I nor anybody else has accurate information. <em>But the notion that the correlation between arbitrarily paired trait variables will be, while not literally zero, of such minuscule size as to be of no importance, is surely wrong.</em> Everybody knows that there is a set of demographic factors, some understood and others quite mysterious, that correlate quite respectably with a variety of traits. (Socioeconomic status, SES, is the one usually considered, and frequently assumed to be only in the “input” causal role.) The clinical scales of the MMPI were developed by empirical keying against a set of disjunct nosological categories, some of which are phenomenologically and psychodynamically opposite to others. Yet the 45 pairwise correlations of these scales are almost always positive (scale Ma provides most of the negatives) and a representative size is in the neighborhood of 0.35 to 0.40. The same is true of the scores on the Strong Vocational Interest Blank, where I find an average absolute value correlation close to 0.40. The malignant influence of so-called “methods covariance” in psychological research that relies upon tasks or tests having certain kinds of behavioral similarities such as questionnaires or ink blots is commonplace and a regular source of concern to clinical and personality psychologists. For further discussion and examples of crud factor size, see <a href="#meehl-1990-2" title="Appraising and amending theories: the strategy of Lakatosian defense and two principles that warrant using it">Meehl (<span>1990<sub><span title="1990 was 35 years ago.">35ya</span></sub></span>)</a>.</p>
<p>Now suppose we imagine a society of psychologists doing research in this soft area, and each investigator sets his experiments up in a whimsical, irrational manner as follows: First he picks a theory at random out of the theory pot. Then he picks a pair of variables randomly out of the observable variable pot. He then arbitrarily assigns a direction (you understand there is no intrinsic connection of content between the substantive theory and the variables, except once in a while there would be such by coincidence) and says that he is going to test the randomly chosen substantive theory by pretending that it predicts—although in fact it does not, having no intrinsic contentual relation—a positive correlation between randomly chosen observational variables <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>. Now suppose that the crud factor operative in the broad domain were 0.30, that is, the average correlation between all of the variables pairwise in this domain is 0.30. This is not sampling error but the true correlation produced by some complex unknown network of genetic and environmental factors. Suppose he divides a normal distribution of subjects at the median and uses all of his cases (which frequently is not what is done, although if properly treated statistically that is not methodologically sinful). Let us take variable <em>X</em> as the “input” variable (never mind its causal role). The mean score of the cases in the top half of the distribution will then be at one mean deviation, that is, in standard score terms they will have an average score of 0.80. Similarly, the subjects in the bottom half of the <em>X</em> distribution will have a mean standard score of -0.80. So the mean difference in standard score terms between the high and low <em>X</em>s, the one “experimental” and the other “control” group, is 1.6. If the regression of output variable <em>Y</em> on <em>X</em> is approximately linear, this yields an expected difference in standard score terms of 0.48, so the difference on the arbitrarily defined “output” variable <em>Y</em> is in the neighborhood of half a standard deviation.</p>
<p>When the investigator runs a <em>t</em>-test on these data, what is the probability of achieving a statistically-significant result? This depends upon the statistical power function and hence upon the sample size, which varies widely, more in soft psychology because of the nature of the data collection problems than in experimental work. I do not have exact figures, but an informal scanning of several issues of journals in the soft areas of clinical, abnormal, and social gave me a representative value of the number of cases in each of two groups being compared at around <em>N</em><sub>1</sub> = <em>N</em><sub>2</sub> = 37 (that’s a median because of the skewness, sample sizes ranging from a low of 17 in one clinical study to a high of 1,000 in a social survey study). Assuming equal variances, this gives us a standard error of the mean difference of 0.2357 in sigma-units, so that our <em>t</em> is a little over 2.0. The substantive theory in a real life case being almost invariably predictive of a direction (it is hard to know what sort of significance testing we would be doing otherwise), the 5% level of confidence can be legitimately taken as one-tailed and in fact could be criticized if it were not (assuming that the 5% level of confidence is given the usual special magical significance afforded it by social scientists!). The directional 5% level being at 1.65, the expected value of our <em>t</em>-test in this situation is approximately 0.35 <em>t</em> units from the required significance level. Things being essentially normal for 72 df, this gives us a power of detecting a difference of around 0.64.</p>
<p>However, since in our imagined “experiment” the assignment of direction was random, the probability of detecting a difference in the predicted direction (even though in reality this prediction was not mediated by any rational relation of content) is only half of that. Even this conservative power based upon the assumption of a completely random association between the theoretical substance and the pseudopredicted direction should give one pause. We find that the probability of getting a positive result from a theory with no verisimilitude whatsoever, associated in a totally whimsical fashion with a pair of variables picked randomly out of the observational pot, is <em>one chance in 3</em>! This is quite different from the 0.05 level that people usually think about. Of course, the reason for this is that the 0.05 level is based upon strictly holding <em>H</em><sub>0</sub> if the theory were false. Whereas, because in the social sciences everything is correlated with everything, for epistemic purposes (despite the rigor of the mathematician’s tables) the true baseline—if the theory has nothing to do with reality and has only a chance relationship to it (so to speak, “any connection between the theory and the facts is purely coincidental”) - is 6 or 7 times as great as the reassuring 0.05 level upon which the psychologist focuses his mind. If the crud factor in a domain were running around 0.40, the power function is 0.86 and the “directional power” for random theory/prediction pairings would be 0.43.</p>
<p>…A similar situation holds for psychopathology, and for many variables in personality measurement that refer to aspects of social competence on the one hand or impairment of interpersonal function (as in mental illness) on the other. <a href="#thorndike-1920">Thorndike had a dictum</a> “All good things tend to go together.”</p>

For reasons to be explained (<a href="#meehl-1990-1">Meehl, <span>1990<sub><span title="1990 was 35 years ago.">35ya</span></sub></span>c</a>), I treat as correlational those experimental studies in which the chief theoretical test provided involves an interaction effect between an experimental manipulation and an individual-differences variable (whether trait, status, or demographic). In correlational research there arises a special problem for the social scientist from the empirical fact that “everything is correlated with everything, more or less.” My colleague David Lykken presses the point further to include most, if not all, purely experimental research designs, saying that, speaking causally, “Everything influences everything”, a stronger thesis that I neither assert nor deny but that I do not rely on here. The obvious fact that everything is more or less correlated with everything in the social sciences is readily foreseen from the armchair on common-sense considerations. These are strengthened by more advanced theoretical arguments involving such concepts as genetic linkage, auto-catalytic effects between cognitive and affective processes, traits reflecting influences such as child-rearing practices correlated with intelligence, ethnicity, social class, religion, and so forth. If one asks, to take a trivial and theoretically uninteresting example, whether we might expect to find social class differences in a color-naming test, there immediately spring to mind numerous influences, ranging from (1) verbal intelligence leading to better verbal discriminations and retention of color names to (2) class differences in maternal teaching behavior (which one can readily observe by watching mothers explain things to their children at a zoo) to (3) more subtle—but still nonzero—influences, such as upper-class children being more likely Anglicans than Baptists, hence exposed to the changes in liturgical colors during the church year! Examples of such multiple possible influences are so easy to generate, I shall resist the temptation to go on. If somebody asks a psychologist or sociologist whether she might expect a nonzero correlation between dental caries and IQ, the best guess would be yes, small but statistically-significant. A small negative correlation was in fact found during the 1920s, misleading some hygienists to hold that IQ was lowered by toxins from decayed teeth. (The received explanation today is that dental caries and IQ are both correlates of social class.) More than 75 years ago, Edward Lee Thorndike enunciated the famous dictum, “All good things tend to go together, as do all bad ones.” Almost all human performance (work competence) dispositions, if carefully studied, are saturated to some extent with the general intelligence factor <em>g</em>, which for psychodynamic and ideological reasons has been somewhat neglected in recent years but is due for a comeback (Betz, <span>1986<sub><span title="1986 was 39 years ago.">39ya</span></sub></span>).<a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>The ubiquity of nonzero correlations gives rise to what is methodologically disturbing to the theory tester and what I call, following Lykken, the crud factor. I have discussed this at length elsewhere (Meehl, <span>1990<sub><span title="1990 was 35 years ago.">35ya</span></sub></span>c), so I only summarize and provide a couple of examples here. The main point is that, when the sample size is sufficiently large to produce accurate estimates of the population values, almost any pair of variables in psychology will be correlated to some extent. Thus, for instance, less than 10% of the items in the MMPI item pool were put into the pool with masculinity-femininity in mind, and the empirically derived <em>Mf</em><span> scale contains only some of those plus others put into the item pool for other reasons, or without any theoretical considerations. When one samples thousands of individuals, it turns out that only 43 of the 550 items (8%) fail to show a significant difference between males and females. In an unpublished study (but see Meehl, <span>1990<sub><span title="1990 was 35 years ago.">35ya</span></sub></span>c) of the hobbies, interests, vocational plans, school course preferences, social life, and home factors of Minnesota college freshmen, when Lykken and I ran chi squares on all possible pairwise combinations of variables, 92% were significant, and 78% were significant at </span><em>p</em> &lt; 10<sup>−6</sup>. Looked at another way, the median number of significant relationships between a given variable and all the others was 41 of a possible 44. One finds such oddities as a relationship between which kind of shop courses boys preferred in high school and which of several Lutheran synods they belonged to!</p>
<p>…The third objection is somewhat harder to answer because it would require an encyclopedic survey of research literature over many domains. It is argued that, although the crud factor is admittedly ubiquitous—that is, almost no correlations of the social sciences are literally zero (as required by the usual significance test)—the crud factor is in most research domains not large enough to be worth worrying about. Without making a claim to know just how big it is, I think this objection is pretty clearly unsound. Doubtless the average correlation of any randomly picked pair of variables in social science depends on the domain, and also on the instruments employed (eg. it is well known that personality inventories often have as much methods-covariance as they do criterion validities).</p>
<p>A representative pairwise correlation among MMPI scales, despite the marked differences (sometimes amounting to phenomenological “oppositeness”) of the nosological rubrics on which they were derived, is in the middle to high 0.30s, in both normal and abnormal populations. The same is true for the occupational keys of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_Interest_Inventory" id="_Or9gFIDD" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_Interest_Inventory#bodyContent" title="Strong Interest Inventory">Strong Vocational Interest Bank</a>. Deliberately aiming to diversify the qualitative features of cognitive tasks (and thus “purify” the measures) in his classic studies of primary mental abilities (“pure factors”, orthogonal), Thurstone (<span>1938<sub><span title="1938 was 87 years ago.">87ya</span></sub></span>; <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/iq/1941-thurstone-factorialstudiesofintelligence.pdf" id="thurstone-thurstone-1941" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-link-icon-color="#f40f02" data-filesize-bytes="7114649" data-filesize-percentage="94" title="_Factorial Studies of Intelligence_">Thurstone &amp; Thurstone, 1941</a>) still found an average intertest correlation of .28 (range = 0.01 to .56!) in the cross-validation sample.

Any treatise on factor analysis exemplifying procedures with empirical data suffices to make the point convincingly. For example, in <a href="https://archive.org/details/ModernFactorAnalysis" id="_EkOsaEjc" data-link-icon="internet-archive" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://archive.org/details/ModernFactorAnalysis?view=theater" title="_Modern Factor Analysis_">Harman (<span>1960<sub><span title="1960 was 65 years ago.">65ya</span></sub></span>)</a>, 8 “emotional” variables correlate .10 to .87, median <em>r</em>= 0.44 (p.&nbsp;176), and 8 “political” variables correlate .03 to .88, median (absolute value) <em>r</em> = 0.62 (p.&nbsp;178). For highly diverse acquiescence-corrected measures (personality traits, interests, hobbies, psychopathology, social attitudes, and religious, political, and moral opinions), estimating individuals’ (orthogonal!) factor scores, one can hold mean <em>r</em>s down to an average of .12, means .04–.20, still some individual <em>r</em><span>s &gt; 0.30 (Lykken, personal communication, <span>1990<sub><span title="1990 was 35 years ago.">35ya</span></sub></span>; cf. McClosky &amp; Meehl, in preparation). Public opinion polls and attitude surveys routinely disaggregate data with respect to several demographic variables (eg. age, education, section of country, sex, ethnicity, religion, education, income, rural/urban, self-described political affiliation) because these factors are always correlated with attitudes or electoral choices, sometimes strongly so. One must also keep in mind that socioeconomic status, although intrinsically interesting (especially to sociologists) is probably often functioning as a proxy for other unmeasured personality or status characteristics that are not part of the definition of social class but are, for a variety of complicated reasons, correlated with it. The proxy role is important because it prevents adequate </span>“controlling for” unknown (or unmeasured) crud-factor influences by statistical procedures (matching, partial correlation, analysis of covariance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_analysis_(statistics)" id="_sNgHsjac" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_analysis_(statistics)#bodyContent" title="Path analysis (statistics)">path analysis</a>).

<blockquote>
<p>In the past 15 years, however, some quantitative sociologists have been attaching less importance to <em>p</em>-values because of practical difficulties and counter-intuitive results. These difficulties are most apparent with large samples, where <em>p</em>-values tend to indicate rejection of the null hypothesis even when the null model seems reasonable theoretically and inspection of the data fails to reveal any striking discrepancies with it. Because much sociological research is based on survey data, often with thousands of cases, sociologists frequently come up against this problem. In the early 1980s, some sociologists dealt with this problem by ignoring the results of <em>p</em>-value-based tests when they seemed counter-intuitive, and by basing model selection instead on theoretical considerations and informal assessment of discrepancies between model and data (eg. Fienberg and Mason, <span>1979<sub><span title="1979 was 46 years ago.">46ya</span></sub></span>; Hout, <span>1983<sub><span title="1983 was 42 years ago.">42ya</span></sub></span>, <span>1984<sub><span title="1984 was 41 years ago.">41ya</span></sub></span>; Grusky and Hauser, <span>1984<sub><span title="1984 was 41 years ago.">41ya</span></sub></span>).</p>
<p>…It is clear that models 1 and 2 are unsatisfactory and should be rejected in favor of model 3.<sup>3</sup> By the standard test, model 3 should also be rejected, in favor of model 4, given the deviance difference of 150 on 16 degrees of freedom, corresponding to a <em>p</em>-value of about 10<sup>−120</sup> . <span><span>Grusky &amp; Hauser</span><span>1984</span></span> nevertheless adopted model 3 because it explains most (99.7%) of the deviance under the baseline model of independence, fits well in the sense that the differences between observed and expected counts are a small proportion of the total, and makes good theoretical sense. This seems sensible, and yet is in dramatic conflict with the <em>p</em>-value-based test. This type of conflict often arises in large samples, and hence is frequent in sociology with its survey data sets comprising thousands of cases. The main response to it has been to claim that there is a distinction between “statistical” and “substantive” significance, with differences that are statistically-significant not necessarily being substantively important.</p>

<p>One serious problem with this statistical testing logic is that the in reality <em>H</em><sub>0</sub> is never true in the population, as recognized by any number of prominent statisticians (<a href="#tukey-1991">Tukey, 1991</a>), ie. there will always be some differences in population parameters, although the differences may be incredibly trivial. Near 40 years ago Savage (<a href="#savage-1957">1957</a>, pp.&nbsp;332–333) noted that, “Null hypotheses of no difference are usually known to be false before the data are collected.” Subsequently, Meehl (<span>1978<sub><span title="1978 was 47 years ago.">47ya</span></sub></span>, p.822) argued, “As I believe is generally recognized by statisticians today and by thoughtful social scientists, the null hypothesis, taken literally, is always false.” Similarly, noted statistician <a href="#hays-1973">Hays</a><span> (<span>1981<sub><span title="1981 was 44 years ago.">44ya</span></sub></span>, p.&nbsp;293 [</span><em>Statistics</em>], 3<sup>rd</sup> ed.) pointed out that “[t]here is surely nothing on earth that is completely independent of anything else.

Where appropriate, we will also comment on Schmidt and Hunter’s (chapter 3 of this volume) rebuttal of arguments against their position.</span></p>
<p><strong>The Null Hypothesis Is Always False?</strong></p>
<p>Cohen (<span>1994<sub><span title="1994 was 31 years ago.">31ya</span></sub></span>), influenced by Meehl (<span>1978<sub><span title="1978 was 47 years ago.">47ya</span></sub></span>), argued that “the nil hypothesis is always false”<span> (p. 1000). Get a large enough sample and you will always reject the null hypothesis. He cites a number of eminent statisticians in support of this view. He quotes Tukey (<span>1991<sub><span title="1991 was 34 years ago.">34ya</span></sub></span>, p. 100) to the effect that there are always differences between experimental treatments-for some decimal places. Cohen cites an unpublished study by Meehl and Lykken in which cross tabulations for 15 Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) items for a sample of 57,000 subjects yielded 105 chi-square tests of association and every one of them was significant, and 96% of them were significant at </span><em>p</em><span> &lt; 0.000001 (Cohen, 1994, p.&nbsp;1000). Cohen cites Meehl (<span>1990<sub><span title="1990 was 35 years ago.">35ya</span></sub></span>) as suggesting that this reflects a </span>“crud factor” in nature. “Everything is related to everything else” to some degree. So, the question is, why do a significance test if you know it will always be significant if the sample is large enough? But if this is an empirical hypothesis, is it not one that is established using significance testing?</p>
<p>But the example may not be an apt demonstration of the principle Cohen sought to establish: It is generally expected that responses to different items responded to by the same subjects are not independently distributed across subjects, so it would not be remarkable to find significant correlations between many such items.</p>
<p>Much more interesting would be to demonstrate systematic and replicable significant treatment effects when subjects are assigned at random to different treatment groups but the <em>same</em> treatments are administered to each group. But in this case, small but significant effects in studies with high power that deviate from expectations of no effect when no differences in treatments are administered are routinely treated as systematic experimenter errors, and knowledge of experimental technique is improved by their detection and removal or control. Systematic error and experimental artifact must always be considered a possibility when rejecting the null hypothesis. Nevertheless, do we know a priori that a test will <em>always</em> be significant if the sample is large enough? Is the proposition “Every statistical hypothesis is false” an <em>axiom</em> that needs no testing? Actually, we believe that to regard this as an axiom would introduce an internal contradiction into statistical reasoning, comparable to arguing that all propositions and descriptions are false. You could not think and reason about the world with such an axiom. So it seems preferable to regard this as some kind of empirical generalization. But no empirical generalization is ever incorrigible and beyond testing. Nevertheless, if indeed there is a phenomenon of nature known as “the crud factor”, then it is something we know to be objectively a fact only because of significance tests. Something in the background noise stands out as a signal against that noise, because we have sufficiently powerful tests using huge samples to detect it. At that point it may become a challenge to science to develop a better understanding of what produces it. However, it may tum out to reflect only experimenter artifact. But in any case the hypothesis of a crud factor is not beyond further testing.</p>
<p>The point is that it doesn’t matter if the null hypothesis is always judged false at some sample size, as long as we regard this as an empirical phenomenon. What matters is whether <em>at the sample size we have</em> we can distinguish observed deviations from our hypothesized values to be sufficiently large and improbable under a hypothesis of chance that we can treat them reasonably but provisionally as not due to chance error. There is no a priori reason to believe that one will always reject the null hypothesis at any given sample size. On the other hand, accepting the null hypothesis does not mean the hypothesized value is true, but rather that the evidence observed is not distinguishable from what we would regard as due to chance if the null hypothesis were true and thus is not sufficient to disprove it. The remaining uncertainty regarding the truth of our null hypothesis is measured by the width of the region of acceptance or a function of the standard error. And this will be closely related to the power of the test, which also provides us with information about our uncertainty. The fact that the width of the region of acceptance shrinks with increasing sample size, means we are able to reduce our uncertainty regarding the provisional validity of an accepted null hypothesis with larger samples. In huge samples the issue of uncertainty due to chance looms not as important as it does in small- and moderate-size samples.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In his classic article on the fallacy of the null hypothesis in soft psychology, <a href="#meehl-1978">Paul Meehl</a> claimed that, in nonexperimental settings, the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis of nil group differences in favor of a directional alternative was 0.50—a value that is an order of magnitude higher than the customary Type I error rate. In a series of real data simulations, using Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-Revised (MMPI-2) data collected from more than 80,000 individuals, I found strong support for Meehl’s claim.</p>
<p>…Before running the experiments I realized that, to be fair to Meehl, I needed a large data set with a broad range of biosocial variables. Fortunately, I had access to data from 81,485 individuals who earlier had completed the 567 items of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-Revised (MMPI-2; Butcher, Dahlstrom, Graham, Tellegen, &amp; Kaemmer, <span>1989<sub><span title="1989 was 36 years ago.">36ya</span></sub></span>). The MMPI-2, in my opinion, is an ideal vehicle for testing Meehl’s claim because it includes items in such varied content domains as general health concerns; personal habits and interests; attitudes towards sex, marriage, and family; affective functioning; normal range personality; and extreme manifestations of psychopathology (for a more complete description of the latent content of the MMPI, see Waller, <span>1999<sub><span title="1999 was 26 years ago.">26ya</span></sub></span>, “Searching for structure in the MMPI”).</p>
<p>…Next, the computer selected (without replacement) a random item from the pool of MMPI-2 items. Using data from the 41,491 males and 39,994 females, it then (1) performed a difference of proportions test on the item group means; (2) recorded the signed <em>z</em>-value; and (3) recorded the associated significance level. Finally, the program tallied the number of “significant” test results (ie. those with |<em>z</em>|≥1.96). The results of this mini simulation were enlightening and in excellent accord with the outcome of Meehl’s <em>gedanken</em> experiment. Specifically, 46% of the directional hypotheses were supported at significance levels that far exceeded traditional <em>p</em>-value cutoffs. A summary of the results is portrayed in Fig. 1. Notice in this figure, which displays the distribution of <em>z</em>-values for the 511 tests, that many of the item mean differences were 50–100 times larger than their associated standard errors!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Induction requires distinguishing meaningful relationships (signals) in the midst of an obscuring background of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding" id="_L43L1NuO" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding#bodyContent" title="Confounding">confounding</a> relationships (noise). The weak and meaningless or substantively secondary correlations in the background make induction untrustworthy. In many tasks, people can distinguish weak signals against rather strong background noise. The reason is that both the signals and the background noise match familiar patterns. For example, a driver traveling to a familiar destination focuses on landmarks that experience has shown to be relevant. People have trouble making such distinctions where signals and noise look much alike or where signals and noise have unfamiliar characteristics. For example, a driver traveling a new road to a new destination is likely to have difficulty spotting landmarks and turns on a recommended route.</p>
<p>Social science research has the latter characteristics. This activity is called research because its outputs are unknown; and the signals and noise look a lot alike in that both have systematic components and both contain components that vary erratically. Therefore, researchers rely upon statistical techniques to distinguish signals from noise. However, these techniques assume: (1) that the so-called random errors really do cancel each other out so that their average values are close to zero; and (2) that the so-called random errors in different variables are uncorrelated. These are very strong assumptions because they presume that the researchers’ hypotheses encompass absolutely all of the systematic effects in the data, including effects that the researchers have not foreseen or measured. When these assumptions are not met, the statistical techniques tend to mistake noise for signal, and to attribute more importance to the researchers’ hypotheses than they deserve.</p>
<p>I remembered what <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/economics/1961-ames.pdf" id="ames-reiter-1961" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-link-icon-color="#f40f02" data-filesize-bytes="1617916" data-filesize-percentage="82" title="Distributions of correlation coefficients in economic time series"><span><span>Ames &amp; Reiter</span><span>1961</span></span></a> had said about how easy it is for macroeconomists to discover statistically-significant correlations that have no substantive significance, and I could see 5 reasons why a similar phenomenon might occur with cross-sectional data. Firstly, a few broad characteristics of people and social systems pervade social science data—examples being sex, age, intelligence, social class, income, education, or organization size. Such characteristics correlate with many behaviors and with each other. Secondly, researchers’ decisions about how to treat data can create correlations between variables. For example, when the Aston researchers used factor analysis to create aggregate variables, they implicitly determined the correlations among these aggregate variables. Thirdly, so-called ‘samples’ are frequently not random, and many of them are complete subpopulations—say, every employee of a company—even though study after study has turned up evidence that people who live close together, who work together, or who socialize together tend to have more attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors in common than do people who are far apart physically and socially. Fourthly, some studies obtain data from respondents at one time and through one method. By including items in a single questionnaire or interview, researchers suggest to respondents that relationships exist among these items. Lastly, most researchers are intelligent people who are living successful lives. They are likely to have some intuitive ability to predict the behaviors of people and of social systems. They are much more likely to formulate hypotheses that accord with their intuition than ones that violate it; they are quite likely to investigate correlations and differences that deviate from zero; and they are less likely than chance would imply to observe correlations and differences near zero.</p>
<p><a href="https://gwern.net/doc/economics/1988-webster.html" id="_9Ox1oap9" data-link-icon="internet-archive" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-filesize-bytes="723500" data-filesize-percentage="67" title="Theory Building In Industrial And Organizational Psychology">Webster and I hypothesized</a> that statistical tests with a null hypothesis of no correlation are biased toward statistical-significance. Webster culled through <em>Administrative Science Quarterly</em>, the <em>Academy of Management Journal</em>, and the <em>Journal of Applied Psychology</em> seeking matrices of correlations. She tabulated only complete matrices of correlations in order to observe the relations among all of the variables that the researchers perceived when drawing inductive inferences, not only those variables that researchers actually included in hypotheses. Of course, some researchers probably gathered data on additional variables beyond those published, and then omitted these additional variables because they correlated very weakly with the dependent variables. We estimated that 64% of the correlations in our data were associated with researchers’ hypotheses.</p>

<figcaption><p><strong>Figure 2.6</strong>: Correlations reported in 3 journals</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Figure 2.6 shows the distributions of 14,897 correlations. In all 3 journals, both the mean correlation and the median correlation were close to +0.09 and the distributions of correlations were very similar. Finding significant correlations is absurdly easy in this population of variables, especially when researchers make two-tailed tests with a null hypothesis of no correlation. Choosing two variables utterly at random, a researcher has 2-to-1 odds of finding a significant correlation on the first try, and 24-to-1 odds of finding a significant correlation within 3 tries (also see <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/www/web-archive.southampton.ac.uk/a9470a09988d6f45ceeb702b8b4e729433320617.pdf" id="_Cg0DLM91" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-link-icon-color="#f40f02" data-url-archive="/doc/www/web-archive.southampton.ac.uk/a9470a09988d6f45ceeb702b8b4e729433320617.pdf" data-url-original="https://web-archive.southampton.ac.uk/cogprints.org/5178/1/are_null_results_becoming.pdf" data-filesize-bytes="32340" data-filesize-percentage="2" title="Are Null Results Becoming an Endangered Species in Marketing?">Hubbard and <span><span>Armstrong</span><span>1992</span></span></a>). Furthermore, the odds are better than 2-to-1 that an observed correlation will be positive, and positive correlations are more likely than negative ones to be statistically-significant. Because researchers gather more data when they are getting small correlations, studies with large numbers of observations exhibit slightly less positive bias. The mean correlation in studies with fewer than 70 observations is about twice the mean correlation in studies with over 180 observations. The main inference I drew from these statistics was that the social sciences are drowning in statistically-significant but meaningless noise. Because the differences and correlations that social scientists test have distributions quite different from those assumed in hypothesis tests, social scientists are using tests that assign statistical-significance to confounding background relationships. Because social scientists equate statistical-significance with meaningful relationships, they often mistake confounding background relationships for theoretically important information. One result is that social science research creates a cloud of statistically-significant differences and correlations that not only have no real meaning but also impede scientific progress by obscuring the truly meaningful relationships.</p>
<p>Suppose that roughly 10% of all observable relations could be theoretically meaningful and that the remaining 90% either have no meanings or can be deduced as implications of the key 10%. However, we do not know now which relations constitute the key 10%, and so our research resembles a search through a haystack in which we are trying to separate needles from more numerous straws. Now suppose that we adopt a search method that makes almost every straw look very much like a needle and that turns up thousands of apparent needles annually; 90% of these apparent needles are actually straws, but we have no way of knowing which ones. Next, we fabricate a theory that ‘explains’ these apparent needles. Some of the propositions in our theory are likely to be correct, merely by chance; but many, many more propositions are incorrect or misleading in that they describe straws. Even if this theory were to account rationally for all of the needles that we have supposedly discovered in the past, which is extremely unlikely, the theory has very little chance of making highly accurate predictions about the consequences of our actions unless the theory itself acts as a powerful self-fulfilling prophecy (Eden and <span><span>Ravid</span><span>1982</span></span>). Our theory would make some correct predictions, of course, because with so many correlated variables, even a completely false theory would have a reasonable chance of generating predictions that come true. Thus, we dare not even take correct predictions as dependable evidence of our theory’s correctness (<a href="https://archive.org/details/psychologyasscie0000dees" id="_Fy_hLQfz" data-link-icon="internet-archive" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://archive.org/details/psychologyasscie0000dees?view=theater" title="<em>Psychology as science and art</em>"><span><span>Deese</span><span>1972</span></span>: 61–67</a> [<em>Psychology as Science and Art</em>]).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>…We examined the extent to which genetic variants, on the one hand, and nongenetic environmental exposures or phenotypic characteristics on the other, tend to be associated with each other, to assess the degree of confounding that would exist in conventional epidemiological studies compared with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_randomization" id="_eB48Cm87" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_randomization#bodyContent" title="Mendelian Randomization">Mendelian Randomization</a> studies. <em>Methods &amp; Findings</em>: We estimated pairwise correlations between [96] nongenetic baseline variables and genetic variables in a cross-sectional study [British Women’s Heart and Health Study; <em>n</em> = 4,286] comparing the number of correlations that were statistically-significant at the 5%, 1%, and 0.01% level (α = 0.05, 0.01, and 0.0001, respectively) with the number expected by chance if all variables were in fact uncorrelated, using a two-sided binomial exact test. We demonstrate that behavioral, socioeconomic, and physiological factors are strongly interrelated, with 45% of all possible pairwise associations between 96 nongenetic characteristics (<em>n</em> = 4,560 correlations) being significant at the <em>p</em> &lt; 0.01 level (the ratio of observed to expected significant associations was 45; <em>p</em>-value for difference between observed and expected &lt; 0.000001). Similar findings were observed for other levels of significance.</p>
<p>…The 96 nongenetic variables generated 4,560 pairwise comparisons, of which, assuming no associations existed, 5 in 100 (total 228) would be expected to be associated by chance at the 5% significance level (α = 0.05). However, 2,447 (54%) of the correlations were significant at the α = 0.05 level, giving an observed to expected (O:E) ratio of 11, <em>p</em> for difference O:E &lt; 0.000001 (Table 1). At the 1% significance level, 45.6 of the correlations would be expected to be associated by chance, but we found that 2,036 (45%) of the pairwise associations were statistically-significant at α = 0.01, giving an O:E ratio of 45, <em>p</em> for difference O:E &lt; 0.000001 (Table 2). At the 0.01% significance level, 0.456 of the correlations would be expected to be associated by chance, but we found that 1,378 (30%) were statistically-significantly associated at α = 0.0001, giving an O:E ratio of 3,022, <em>p</em> for difference O:E &lt; 0.000001.</p>
<p>…Over 50% of the pairwise associations between baseline nongenetic characteristics in our study were statistically-significant at the 0.05 level; an 11-fold increase from what would be expected, assuming these characteristics were independent. Similar findings were found for statistically-significant associations at the 0.01 level (45-fold increase from expected) and the 0.0001 level (3,000-fold increase from expected). This illustrates the considerable difficulty of determining which associations are valid and potentially causal from a background of highly correlated factors, reflecting that behavioral, socioeconomic, and physiological characteristics tend to cluster. This tendency will mean that there will often be high levels of confounding when studying any single factor in relation to an outcome. Given the complexity of such confounding, even after formal statistical adjustment, a lack of data for some confounders, and measurement error in assessed confounders will leave considerable scope for <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/statistics/bayes/regression-to-mean/index" id="_8LEzTTCn" data-filesize-bytes="43699" data-filesize-percentage="38" title="'Regression To The Mean Fallacies', Gwern 2021">residual confounding</a> <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/statistics/causality/1992-phillips.pdf" id="phillips-smith-1992" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-link-icon-color="#f40f02" data-filesize-bytes="589586" data-filesize-percentage="62" title="'Bias in relative odds estimation owing to imprecise measurement of correlated exposures', Phillips &amp; Smith 1992">[4]</a>. When epidemiological studies present adjusted associations as a reflection of the magnitude of a causal association, they are assuming that all possible confounding factors have been accurately measured and that their relationships with the outcome have been appropriately modelled. We think this is unlikely to be the case in most observational epidemiological studies <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/statistics/causality/1991-phillips.pdf" id="phillips-smith-1991" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-link-icon-color="#f40f02" data-filesize-bytes="1044312" data-filesize-percentage="75" title="'How independent are `independent` effects? Relative risk estimation when correlated exposures are measured imprecisely', Phillips &amp; Smith 1991">[26]</a>.</p>
<p>Predictably, such confounded relationships will be particularly marked for highly socially and culturally patterned risk factors, such as dietary intake. This high degree of confounding might underlie the poor concordance of observational epidemiological studies that identified dietary factors (such as beta carotene, vitamin E, and vitamin C intake) as protective against cardiovascular disease and cancer, with the findings of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial" id="_q1b5B-dQ" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial#bodyContent" title="Randomized controlled trial">randomized controlled trials</a> of these dietary factors [1,27]. Indeed, with 45% of the pairwise associations of nongenetic characteristics being “statistically-significant” at the <em>p</em> &lt; 0.01 level in our study, and our study being unexceptional with regard to the levels of confounding that will be found in observational investigations, it is clear that the large majority of associations that exist in observational databases will not reach publication. We suggest that those that do achieve publication will reflect apparent biological plausibility (a weak causal criterion <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/statistics/causality/1992-smith.pdf" id="smith-et-al-1992" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-link-icon-color="#f40f02" data-filesize-bytes="585231" data-filesize-percentage="62" title="'Smoking as `independent` risk factor for suicide: illustration of an artifact from observational epidemiology?', Smith et al 1992">[28]</a>) and the interests of investigators. Examples exist of investigators reporting provisional analyses in abstracts—such as antioxidant vitamin intake being apparently protective against future cardiovascular events in women with clinical evidence of cardiovascular disease [29]—but not going on to full publication of these findings, perhaps because randomized controlled trials appeared soon after the presentation of the abstracts [30] that rendered their findings as being unlikely to reflect causal relationships. Conversely, it is likely that the large majority of null findings will not achieve publication, unless they contradict high-profile prior findings, as has been demonstrated in molecular genetic research [31].</p>

<p>The magnitudes of most of the significant correlations between nongenetic characteristics were small (see Figure 1), with a median value at <em>p</em> ≤ 0.01 and <em>p</em> ≤ 0.05 of 0.08, and it might be considered that such weak associations are unlikely to be important sources of confounding. However, so many associated nongenetic variables, even with weak correlations, can present a very important potential for residual confounding. For example, we have previously demonstrated how 15 socioeconomic and behavioral risk factors, each with weak but statistically independent (at <em>p</em> ≤ 0.05) associations with both vitamin C levels and coronary heart disease (CHD), could together account for an apparent strong protective effect (odds ratio = 0.60 comparing top to bottom quarter of vitamin C distribution) of vitamin C on CHD (<a href="https://gwern.net/doc/www/www.thelancet.com/a74f7f8ed2c6f8eb6e9bb9b17d2fd765b549d550.html" id="lawlor-2004" data-link-icon="L" data-link-icon-type="text" data-link-icon-color="#004582" data-url-archive="/doc/www/www.thelancet.com/a74f7f8ed2c6f8eb6e9bb9b17d2fd765b549d550.html" data-url-original="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(04)16925-0/fulltext" data-filesize-bytes="5464992" data-filesize-percentage="84" title="'Observational versus randomized trial evidence', Lawlor et al 2004a">32</a> [see also <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/statistics/causality/2004-lawlor.pdf" id="_iw3VVuYg" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-link-icon-color="#f40f02" data-filesize-bytes="87279" data-filesize-percentage="16" title="Those confounded vitamins: what can we learn from the differences between observational versus randomized trial evidence?"><span><span title="et al">Lawlor</span><span> et al </span><span>2004b</span></span></a>]).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think that McCloskey and Ziliak, and also Hoover and Siegler, would agree with me that the null hypothesis of zero coefficient is essentially always false. (The paradigmatic example in economics is program evaluation, and I think that just about every program being seriously considered will have effects—positive for some people, negative for others—but not averaging to exactly zero in the population.) From this perspective, the point of hypothesis testing (or, for that matter, of confidence intervals) is not to assess the null hypothesis but to give a sense of the uncertainty in the inference. As Hoover and Siegler put it, “while the economic significance of the coefficient does not depend on the statistical-significance, our certainty about the accuracy of the measurement surely does. . . . Significance tests, properly used, are a tool for the assessment of signal strength and not measures of economic significance.” Certainly, I’d rather see an estimate with an assessment of statistical-significance than an estimate without such an assessment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My third meta-principle is that <em>different applications demand different philosophies</em>. This principle comes up for me in Efron’s discussion of hypothesis testing and the so-called false discovery rate, which I label as “so-called” for the following reason. In Efron’s formulation (which follows the classical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons_problem" id="_r85cb20T" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons_problem#bodyContent" title="Multiple comparisons problem">multiple comparisons</a> literature), a “false discovery” is a zero effect that is identified as nonzero, whereas, in my own work, I never study zero effects. The effects I study are sometimes small but it would be silly, for example, to suppose that the difference in voting patterns of men and women (after controlling for some other variables) could be exactly zero. My problems with the “false discovery” formulation are partly a matter of taste, I’m sure, but I believe they also arise from the difference between problems in genetics (in which some genes really have essentially zero effects on some traits, so that the classical hypothesis-testing model is plausible) and in social science and environmental health (where essentially everything is connected to everything else, and effect sizes follow a continuous distribution rather than a mix of large effects and near-exact zeroes).</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>There are (almost) no true zeroes: difficulties with the research program of learning causal structure</em></p>
<p>We can distinguish between learning within a causal model (that is, inference about parameters characterizing a specified directed graph) and learning causal structure itself (that is, inference about the graph itself). In social science research, I am extremely skeptical of this second goal.</p>
<p>The difficulty is that, in social science, there are no true zeroes. For example, religious attendance is associated with attitudes on economic as well as social issues, and both these correlations vary by state. And it does not interest me, for example, to test a model in which social class affects vote choice through party identification but not along a direct path.</p>
<p>More generally, anything that plausibly could have an effect will not have an effect that is exactly zero. I can respect that some social scientists find it useful to frame their research in terms of conditional independence and the testing of null effects, but I don’t generally find this approach helpful—and I certainly don’t believe that it is necessary to think in terms of conditional independence in order to study causality. Without structural zeroes, it is impossible to identify graphical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_equation_modeling" id="_u_O3tbiW" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_equation_modeling#bodyContent" title="Structural equation modeling">structural equation models</a>.</p>
<p>The most common exceptions to this rule, as I see it, are independences from design (as in a designed or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_experiment" id="_BjPM3vhm" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_experiment#bodyContent" title="Natural experiment">natural experiment</a>) or effects that are zero based on a plausible scientific hypothesis (as might arise, for example, in genetics where genes on different chromosomes might have essentially independent effects), or in a study of ESP. In such settings I can see the value of testing a null hypothesis of zero effect, either for its own sake or to rule out the possibility of a conditional correlation that is supposed not to be there.</p>
<p>Another sort of exception to the “no zeroes” rule comes from information restriction: a person’s decision should not be affected by knowledge that he or she doesn’t have. For example, a consumer interested in buying apples cares about the total price he pays, not about how much of that goes to the seller and how much goes to the government in the form of taxes. So the restriction is that the utility depends on prices, not on the share of that going to taxes. That is the type of restriction that can help identify demand functions in economics.</p>
<p>I realize, however, that my perspective that there are no zeroes (information restrictions aside) is a minority view among social scientists and perhaps among people in general, on the evidence of psychologist Sloman’s book. For example, from chapter 2: “A good politician will know who is motivated by greed and who is motivated by larger principles in order to discern how to solicit each one’s vote when it is needed.” I can well believe that people think in this way but I don’t buy it! Just about everyone is motivated by greed and by larger principles! This sort of discrete thinking doesn’t seem to me to be at all realistic about how people behave-although it might very well be a good model about how people characterize others!</p>
<p>In the next chapter, Sloman writes, “No matter how many times A and B occur together, mere co-occurrence cannot reveal <em>whether</em> A causes B, or B causes A, or something else causes both.” [italics added] Again, I am bothered by this sort of discrete thinking. I will return in a moment with an example, but just to speak generally, if A <em>could</em> cause B, and B <em>could</em> cause A, then I would think that, yes, they could cause each other. And if something else <em>could</em> cause them both, I imagine that could be happening along with the causation of A on B and of B on A.</p>
<p>Here we’re getting into some of the differences between a normative view of science, a descriptive view of science, and a descriptive view of how people perceive the world. Just as there are limits to what “folk physics” can tell us about the motion of particles, similarly I think we have to be careful about too closely identifying “folk causal inference” from the stuff done by the best social scientists. To continue the analogy: it is interesting to study how we develop physical intuitions using commonsense notions of force, energy, momentum, and so on—but it’s also important to see where these intuitions fail. Similarly, ideas of causality are fundamental but that doesn’t stop ordinary people and even experts from making basic mistakes.</p>
<p>Now I would like to return to the graphical model approach described by Sloman. In chapter 5, he discusses an example with 3 variables:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If two of the variables are dependent, say, intelligence and socioeconomic status, but conditionally independent given the third variable [beer consumption], then either they are related by one of two chains:</p>
<pre><code>(Intelligence → Amount of beer consumed → Socioeconomic status)
(Socio-economic status → Amount of beer consumed → Intelligence)</code></pre>
<p>or by a fork:</p>
<pre><code>                           Socioeconomic status
                         ⤴
 Amount of beer consumed
                         ⤵
                           Intelligence</code></pre>
<p>and then we must use some other means [other than observational data] to decide between these 3 possibilities. In some cases, common sense may be sufficient, but we can also, if necessary, run an experiment. If we intervene and vary the amount of beer consumed and see that we affect intelligence, that implies that the second or third model is possible; the first one is not. Of course, all this assumes that there aren’t other variables mediating between the ones shown that provide alternative explanations of the dependencies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes no sense to me. I don’t see why only one of the 3 models can be true. This is a mathematical possibility, but it seems highly implausible to me. And, in particular, running an experiment that reveals one of these causal effects does <em>not</em> rule out the other possible paths. For example, suppose that Sloman were to perform the above experiment (finding that beer consumption affects intelligence) and then <em>another</em> experiment, this time varying intelligence (in some way; the method of doing this can very well determine the causal effect) and finding that it affects the amount of beer consumed.</p>
<p>Beyond this fundamental problem, I have a statistical critique, which is that in social science you won’t have these sorts of conditional independencies, except from design or as artifacts of small sample sizes that do not allow us to distinguish small dependencies from zero.</p>
<p>I think I see where Sloman is coming from, from a psychological perspective: you see these variables that are related to each other, and you want to know which is the cause and which is the effect. But I don’t think this is a useful way of understanding the world, just as I don’t think it’s useful to categorize political players as being motivated either by greed or by larger principles, but not both. Exclusive-or might feel right to us internally, but I don’t think it works as science.</p>
<p>One important place where I agree with Sloman (and thus with Pearl and Sprites et al.) is in the emphasis that causal structure cannot in general be learned from observational data alone; they hold the very reasonable position that we can use observational data to rule out possibilities and formulate hypotheses, and then use some sort of intervention or experiment (whether actual or hypothetical) to move further. In this way they connect the observational/experimental division to the hypothesis/deduction formulation that is familiar to us from the work of Popper, Kuhn, and other modern philosophers of science.</p>
<p>The place where I think Sloman is misguided is in his formulation of scientific models in an either/or way, as if, in truth, social variables are linked in simple causal paths, with a scientific goal of figuring out if A causes B or the reverse. I don’t know much about intelligence, beer consumption, and socioeconomic status, but I certainly don’t see any simple relationships between income, religious attendance, party identification, and voting—and I don’t see how a search for such a pattern will advance our understanding, at least given current techniques. I’d rather start with description and then go toward causality following the approach of economists and statisticians by thinking about potential interventions one at a time. I’d love to see Sloman’s and Pearl’s ideas of the interplay between observational and experimental data developed in a framework that is less strongly tied to the notion of choice among simple causal structures.</p>

<p>The effects are certainly not zero.

<p>Several of the examples in <em>Statistical Inference</em> represent solutions to problems that seem to us to be artificial or conventional tasks with no clear analogy to applied work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“They are artificial and are expressed in terms of a survey of 100 individuals expressing support (Yes/No) for the president, before and after a presidential address (…) The question of interest is whether there has been a change in support between the surveys (…). We want to assess the evidence for the hypothesis of equality <em>H</em><sub>1</sub> against the alternative hypothesis <em>H</em><sub>2</sub> of a change.” —<em>Statistical Inference</em>, page 147</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on our experience in public opinion research, this is not a real question. Support for any political position is always changing. The real question is how much the support has changed, or perhaps how this change is distributed across the population.</p>
<p>A defender of Aitkin (and of classical hypothesis testing) might respond at this point that, yes, everybody knows that changes are never exactly zero and that we should take a more “grown-up” view of the null hypothesis, not that the change is zero but that it is nearly zero. Unfortunately, the metaphorical interpretation of hypothesis tests has problems similar to the theological doctrines of the Unitarian church. Once you have abandoned literal belief in the Bible, the question soon arises: why follow it at all? Similarly, once one recognizes the inappropriateness of the point null hypothesis, we think it makes more sense not to try to rehabilitate it or treat it as treasured metaphor but rather to attack our statistical problems directly, in this case by performing inference on the change in opinion in the population.</p>
<p>To be clear: we are not denying the value of hypothesis testing. In this example, we find it completely reasonable to ask whether observed changes are statistically-significant, i.e. whether the data are consistent with a null hypothesis of zero change. What we do not find reasonable is the statement that “the question of interest is whether there has been a change in support.”</p>
<p>All this is application-specific. Suppose public opinion was observed to really be flat, punctuated by occasional changes, as in the left graph in Figure 7.1. In that case, Aitkin’s question of “whether there has been a change” would be well-defined and appropriate, in that we could interpret the null hypothesis of no change as some minimal level of baseline variation.</p>
<p>Real public opinion, however, does not look like baseline noise plus jumps, but rather shows continuous movement on many time scales at once, as can be seen from the right graph in Figure 7.1, which shows actual presidential approval data. In this example, we do not see Aitkin’s question as at all reasonable. Any attempt to work with a null hypothesis of opinion stability will be inherently arbitrary. It would make much more sense to model opinion as a continuously-varying process. The statistical problem here is not merely that the null hypothesis of zero change is nonsensical; it is that the null is in no sense a reasonable approximation to any interesting model. The sociological problem is that, from <a href="#savage-1954">Savage (<span>1954<sub><span title="1954 was 71 years ago.">71ya</span></sub></span>)</a> onward, many Bayesians have felt the need to mimic the classical null-hypothesis testing framework, even where it makes no sense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Internet has provided IS researchers with the opportunity to conduct studies with extremely large samples, frequently well over 10,000 observations. There are many advantages to large samples, but researchers using statistical inference must be aware of the <em>p</em>-value problem associated with them. In very large samples, <em>p</em>-values go quickly to zero, and solely relying on <em>p</em>-values can lead the researcher to claim support for results of no practical significance. In a survey of large sample IS research, we found that a significant number of papers rely on a low <em>p</em>-value and the sign of a regression coefficient alone to support their hypotheses. This research commentary recommends a series of actions the researcher can take to mitigate the <em>p</em>-value problem in large samples and illustrates them with an example of over 300,000 camera sales on eBay. We believe that addressing the <em>p</em>-value problem will increase the credibility of large sample IS research as well as provide more insights for readers.</p>
<p>…A key issue with applying small-sample statistical inference to large samples is that even minuscule effects can become statistically-significant. The increased power leads to a dangerous pitfall as well as to a huge opportunity. The issue is one that statisticians have long been aware of: “the <em>p</em>-value problem.” Chatfield (<span>1995<sub><span title="1995 was 30 years ago.">30ya</span></sub></span>, p.&nbsp;70 [<em>Problem Solving: A Statistician’s Guide, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed</em>]) comments, “The question is not whether differences are ‘significant’ (they nearly always are in large samples), but whether they are interesting. Forget statistical-significance, what is the practical significance of the results?” The increased power of large samples means that researchers can detect smaller, subtler, and more complex effects, but relying on <em>p</em>-values alone can lead to claims of support for hypotheses of little or no practical significance.</p>
<p>…In reviewing the literature, we found only a few mentions of the large-sample issue and its effect on <em>p</em>-values; we also saw little recognition that the authors’ low <em>p</em>-values might be an artifact of their large-sample sizes. Authors who recognized the “large-sample, small <em>p</em>-values” issue addressed it by one of the following approaches: reducing the significance level threshold<sup>5</sup> (which does not really help), by recomputing the <em>p</em>-value for a small sample (Gefen and <span><span>Carmel</span><span>2008</span></span>), or by focusing on practical significance and commenting about the uselessness of statistical-significance (<a href="https://gwern.net/doc/www/terpconnect.umd.edu/47df2c4ced4e178de4bad4630e42e69b863d3c71.pdf" id="_qOPgNhUs" data-link-icon="pdf" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-link-icon-color="#f40f02" data-url-archive="/doc/www/terpconnect.umd.edu/47df2c4ced4e178de4bad4630e42e69b863d3c71.pdf" data-url-original="https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~smithas/papers/mithaslucas2010ms.pdf" data-filesize-bytes="199929" data-filesize-percentage="15" title="Are foreign IT workers cheaper?

<p>Here’s what I did. I thought up 30 pairs of variables that would be easy to measure and that might relate in diverse ways. Some variables were physical (the distance versus apparent brightness of nearby stars), some biological (the length versus weight of sticks found in my back yard), and some psychological or social (the S&amp;P 500 index closing value versus number of days past). Some I would expect to show no relationship (the number of pages in a library book versus how high up it is shelved in the library), some I would expect to show a roughly linear relationship (distance of McDonald’s franchises from my house versus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapQuest" id="_zALzj9Ko" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapQuest#bodyContent" title="MapQuest">MapQuest</a> estimated driving time), and some I expected to show a curved or complex relationship (forecasted temperature versus time of day, size in KB of a JPG photo of my office versus the angle at which the photo was taken). <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/www/schwitzsplintersunderblog.blogspot.com/aa86fa2004e20effba2df61d144affd0891a352a.html" id="_OWI49Lia" data-url-archive="/doc/www/schwitzsplintersunderblog.blogspot.com/aa86fa2004e20effba2df61d144affd0891a352a.html" data-url-original="https://schwitzsplintersunderblog.blogspot.com/2013/02/variables-measured-for-post-preliminary.html" data-filesize-bytes="1626708" data-filesize-percentage="59" title="Variables Measured for the Post 'Preliminary Evidence That the World Is Simple'">See here</a> for the full list of variables. I took 11 measurements of each variable pair. Then I analyzed the resulting data.</p>
<p>Now, if the world is massively complex, then it should be difficult to predict a third datapoint from any two other data points. Suppose that two measurements of some continuous variable yield values of 27 and 53. What should I expect the third measured value to be? Why not 1,457,002? Or 3.22 × 10<sup>−17</sup>? There are just as many functions (that is, infinitely many) containing 27, 53, and 1,457,002 as there are containing 27, 53, and some more pedestrian-seeming value like 44.</p>
<p>…To conduct the test, I used each pair of dependent variables to predict the value of the next variable in the series (the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> observations predicting the value of the 3<sup>rd</sup>, the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> predicting the value of the 4<sup>th</sup>, etc.), yielding 270 predictions for the 30 variables. I counted an observation “wild” if its absolute value was 10 times the maximum of the absolute value of the two previous observations or if its absolute value was below <span>1⁄10</span> of the minimum of the absolute value of the two previous observations. Separately, I also looked for flipped signs (either two negative values followed by a positive or two positive values followed by a negative), though most of the variables only admitted positive values. This measure of wildness yielded 3 wild observations out of 270 (1%) plus another 3 flipped-sign cases (total 2%). (A few variables were capped, either top or bottom, in a way that would make an above-10x or below-1/10<sup>th</sup> observation analytically unlikely, but excluding such variables wouldn’t affect the result much.) So it looks like the Wild Complexity Thesis might be in trouble.</p>

<p>A significance test is a scientific instrument, and like any other instrument, it has a certain degree of precision. If you make the test more sensitive—by increasing the size of the studied population, for example—you enable yourself see ever-smaller effects. That’s the power of the method, but also its danger. The truth is, the null hypothesis is probably <em>always</em> false! When you drop a powerful drug into a patient’s bloodstream, it’s hard to believe the intervention literally has zero effect on the probability that the patient will develop esophageal cancer, or thrombosis, or bad breath. Each part of the body speaks to every other, in a complex feedback loop of influence and control. Everything you do either gives you cancer or prevents it. And in principle, if you carry out a powerful enough study, you can find out which it is. But those effects are usually so minuscule that they can be safely ignored. Just because we can detect them doesn’t always mean they matter…The right question isn’t, “Do basketball players sometimes temporarily get better or worse at making shots?”—the kind of yes/no question a significance test addresses. The right question is “How <em>much</em> does their ability vary with time, and to what extent can observers detect in real time whether a player is hot?” Here, the answer is surely “not as much as people think, and hardly at all.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The more important question is whether it is true that there are always real differences in the real world, and what the ‘real world’ is. Let’s consider the population of people in the real world. While you read this sentence, some individuals in this population have died, and some were born. For most questions in psychology, the population is surprisingly similar to an eternally running Monte Carlo simulation. Even if you could measure all people in the world in a millisecond, and the test-retest correlation was perfect, the answer you would get now would be different from the answer you would get in an hour. Frequentists (the people that use NHST) are not specifically interested in the exact value now, or in one hour, or next week Thursday, but in the average value in the ‘long’ run. The value in the real world today might never be zero, but it’s never anything, because it’s continuously changing. If we want to make generalizable statements about the world, I think the fact that the null-hypothesis is never precisely true at any specific moment is not a problem. I’ll ignore more complex questions for now, such as how we can establish whether effects vary over time.</p>
<p>…Meehl talks about how in psychology every individual-difference variable (eg. trait, status, demographic) correlates with every other variable, which means the null is practically never true. In these situations, it’s not that testing against the null-hypothesis is meaningless, but it’s not informative. If everything correlates with everything else, you need to create good models, and test those. A simple null-hypothesis significance test will not get you very far. I agree.</p>
<p><strong><em>Random Assignment versus Crud</em></strong></p>
<p>To illustrate when NHST can be used to as a source of information in large samples, and when NHST is not informative in large samples, I’ll analyze data of large dataset with 6344 participants from the Many Labs project. I’ve analyzed 10 dependent variables to see whether they were influenced by (1) Gender, and (2) Assignment to the high or low anchoring condition in the first study. Gender is a measured individual difference variable, and not a manipulated variable, and might thus be affected by what Meehl calls the crud factor. Here, I want to illustrate this is (1) probably often true for individual difference variables, but perhaps not always true, and (2) it is probably never true for when analyzing differences between groups individuals were randomly assignment to.</p>
<p>…When we analyze the 10 dependent variables as a function of the anchoring condition, none of the differences are statistically-significant (even though there are more than 6000 participants). You can play around with the script, repeating the analysis for the conditions related to the other 3 anchoring questions (remember to correct for multiple comparisons if you perform many tests), and see how randomization does a pretty good job at returning non-statistically-significant results even in very large sample sizes. If the null is always false, it is remarkably difficult to reject. Obviously, when we analyze the answer people gave on the first anchoring question, we find a huge effect of the high versus low anchoring condition they were randomly assigned to. Here, NHST works. There is probably something going on. If the anchoring effect was a completely novel phenomenon, this would be an important first finding, to be followed by replications and extensions, and finally model building and testing.</p>
<p>The results change dramatically if we use Gender as a factor. There are Gender effects on dependent variables related to quote attribution, system justification, the gambler’s fallacy, imagined contact, the explicit evaluation of arts and math, and the norm of reciprocity. There are no significant differences in political identification (as conservative or liberal), on the response scale manipulation, or on gain versus loss framing (even though <em>p</em> = 0.025, such a high <em>p</em>-value is stronger support for the null-hypothesis than for the alternative hypothesis with 5500 participants). It’s surprising that the null-hypothesis (gender does not influence the responses participants give) is rejected for 7 out of 10 effects. Personally (perhaps because I’ve got very little expertise in gender effects) I was actually extremely surprised, even though the effects are small (with Cohen <em>d</em>’s or around 0.09). This, ironically, shows that NHST works—I’ve learned gender effects are much more widespread than I’d have though before I wrote this blog post.</p>

<p>Many studies have examined the correlations between national IQs and various country-level indexes of well-being. The analyses have been unsystematic and not gathered in one single analysis or dataset. In this paper I gather a large sample of country-level indexes and show that there is a strong general socioeconomic factor (S factor) which is highly correlated (.86–.87) with national cognitive ability using either Lynn and Vanhanen’s dataset or Altinok’s. Furthermore, the method of correlated vectors shows that the correlations between variable loadings on the S factor and cognitive measurements are .99 in both datasets using both cognitive measurements, indicating that it is the S factor that drives the relationship with national cognitive measurements, not the remaining variance.</p>

<p>It’s a brand new ranking. Called the Sustainable Development Goals Gender Index, it gives 129 countries a score for progress on achieving gender equality by 2030. Here’s the quick summary: Things are “good” in much of Europe and North America. And “very poor” in much of sub-Saharan Africa. In fact, that’s the way it looks in many international rankings, which tackle everything from the worst places to be a child to the most corrupt countries to world happiness…As for the fact that many rankings look the same at the top and bottom, one reason has to do with money. Many indexes are correlated with GDP per capita, a measure of a country’s prosperity, says Kenny. That includes the World Bank’s Human Capital Index, which measures the economic productivity of a country’s young people; and Freedom House’s Freedom in the World index, which ranks the world by its level of democracy, including economic freedom. And countries that have more money can spend more money on health, education and infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>Is Too Much Variance Explained?</strong> It is interesting that historically the I-O literature has bemoaned the presence of a “validity ceiling”, and the field seemed to be unable to make large gains in the prediction of job performance (Highhouse, <span>2008<sub><span title="2008 was 17 years ago.">17ya</span></sub></span>). In contrast, LeBreton et al. appear to have the opposite concern—that we maybe able to predict too much, perhaps even all, of the variance in job performance once accounting for statistical artifacts. In addition to their 4 focal predictors (ie. GMA, integrity, structured interview, work sample), LeBreton et al. list an additional 24 variables that have been shown to be related to job performance meta-analytically. However, we believe that many of the variables LeBreton et al. included in their list are variables that Sackett, Borneman, and Connelly (<span>2009<sub><span title="2009 was 16 years ago.">16ya</span></sub></span>) would argue are likely unknowable at time of hire.</p>
<p>…Furthermore, in contrast to LeBreton et al.’s assertion that organizational variables, such as procedural justice, are likely unrelated to their focal predictors, our belief is that many of these variables are likely to be at least moderately correlated–limiting the incremental validity we could expect with the inclusion of these additional variables. For example, research has shown that integrity tests mostly tap into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness#Personality_models" id="_LpC9lLj1" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness#bodyContent" title="Conscientiousness § Personality models">Conscientiousness</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreeableness" id="__Qr-IYeG" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreeableness#bodyContent" title="Agreeableness">Agreeableness</a>, and Emotional Stability (Ones &amp; Viswesvaran, <span>2001<sub><span title="2001 was 24 years ago.">24ya</span></sub></span>), and a recent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis" id="_tKvFlpVk" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis#bodyContent" title="Meta-analysis">meta-analysis</a> of organizational justice shows that all 3 personality traits are moderately related to one’s experience of procedural justice (ρ=0.19–0.23; <span><span title="et al">Hutchinson</span><span> et al </span><span>2014</span></span><span>), suggesting that even apparently unrelated variables can share a surprising amount of construct-level variance.

<blockquote>
<p>We examine how common techniques used to measure the causal impact of ad exposures on users’ conversion outcomes compare to the “gold standard” of a true experiment (randomized controlled trial). Using data from 12 US advertising lift studies at Facebook comprising 435 million user-study observations and 1.4 billion total impressions we contrast the experimental results to those obtained from observational methods, such as comparing exposed to unexposed users, matching methods, model-based adjustments, synthetic matched-markets tests, and before-after tests. We show that observational methods often fail to produce the same results as true experiments even after conditioning on information from thousands of behavioral variables and using non-linear models. We explain why this is the case. Our findings suggest that common approaches used to measure advertising effectiveness in industry fail to measure accurately the true effect of ads.</p>
<p>An important input to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propensity_score_matching" id="_KiZ5d_hD" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propensity_score_matching#bodyContent" title="Propensity score matching">propensity score matching</a> (PSM) is the set of variables used to predict the propensity score itself. We tested 3 different PSM specifications for study 4, each of which used a larger set of inputs.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>PSM 1</strong>: In addition to age and gender, the basis of our exact matching (EM) approach, this specification uses common Facebook variables, such as how long users have been on Facebook, how many Facebook friends the have, their reported relationship status, and their phone OS, in addition to other user characteristics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>PSM 2</strong>: In addition to the variables in PSM 1, this specification uses Facebook’s estimate of the user’s zip code of residence to associate with each user nearly 40 variables drawn from the most recent Census and American Communities Surveys (ACS).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>PSM 3</strong>: In addition to the variables in PSM 2, this specification adds a composite metric of Facebook data that summarizes thousands of behavioral variables. This is a machine-learning based metric used by Facebook to construct target audiences that are similar to consumers that an advertiser has identified as desirable.<sup><a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/164749007013531" id="_L-BscyZP" data-link-icon="facebook" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-link-icon-color="#1877f2" title="About Lookalike Audiences: A Lookalike Audience is a way to reach new people who are likely to be interested in your business because they're similar to your best existing customers.">16</a></sup> Using this metric bases the estimation of our propensity score on a non-linear machine-learning model with thousands of features.<sup>17</sup></p></li>
</ol>
<p>…When we go from exact matching (EM) to our most parsimonious propensity score matching model (PSM 1), the conversion rate for unexposed users increases from 0.032% to 0.042%, decreasing the implied advertising lift from 221% to 147%. PSM 2 performs similarly to PSM 1, with an implied lift of 154%.<sup>21</sup> Finally, adding the composite measure of Facebook variables in PSM 3 improves the fit of the propensity model (as measured by a higher AUC/ROC) and further increases the conversion rate for matched unexposed users to 0.051%. The result is that our best performing PSM model estimates an advertising lift of 102%…We summarize the result of all our propensity score matching and regression methods for study 4 in Figure 7.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>While not directly testing statistical-significance in its propensity scoring, the increasing accuracy in estimating the true causal effect of adding in additional behavioral variables implies that (especially at Facebook-scale, using billions of datapoints) the correlations of the thousands of used variables with the advertising behavior would be statistically-significant and demonstrate that everything is correlated.

<p>In our ISIR 2019 presentation (<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xxfYTWP2R0ZFvbI24sR1jVyFC_qN_Lw85782zE5Q2Jo/edit" id="_9uNcP5Wd" data-link-icon="word-doc" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-link-icon-color="#4285f4" title="Machine learning psychometrics: ISIR 2019">“Machine learning psychometrics: Improved cognitive ability validity from supervised training on item level data”</a>), we showed that one can use machine learning on cognitive data to improve the predictive validity of it. The effect sizes can be quite large, eg. one could predict educational attainment in the Vietnam Experience Study (VES) sample (<em>n</em> = 4.5k US army recruits) at R<sup>2</sup>=32.3% with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge_regression" id="_uewD694v" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge_regression#bodyContent" title="Ridge regression">ridge regression</a> versus 17.7% with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Item_response_theory" id="_ztWiV6Yy" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Item_response_theory#bodyContent" title="Item response theory">IRT</a>. Prediction is more than <em>g</em>, after all. What if we had a dataset of 185 diverse items, and we train the model to predict IRT-based <em>g</em> from the full set, but using only a limited set using the LASSO? How many items do we need when optimally weighted? Turns out that with 42 items, one can get a test that correlates at 0.96 with the full <em>g</em>. That’s an abbreviation of nearly 80%!</p>
<p>Now comes the fancy part. What if we have archival datasets with only a few cognitive items (eg. datasets with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini%E2%80%93mental_state_examination" id="_2RpeWFt8" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini%E2%80%93mental_state_examination#bodyContent" title="Mini–mental state examination">MMSE</a> items) or maybe even no items. Can we improve things here? Maybe! If the dataset has a lot of other items, we may be able to train an machine learning (ML) model that predict <em>g</em> quite well from them, even if they seem unrelated. Every item has some variance overlap with <em>g</em> however small (crud factor), it is only a question of having a good enough algorithm and enough data to exploit this covariance. For instance, I have found that if one uses the 556 items in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Multiphasic_Personality_Inventory" id="_Tr4qHl-1" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Multiphasic_Personality_Inventory#bodyContent" title="Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory">MMPI</a> in the VES to predict the very well measured <em>g</em> based on all the cognitive data (18 tests), how well can one do? I was surprised to learn that one can do <em>extremely</em> well:</p>
<p><a href="https://gwern.net/doc/iq/2020-kirkegaard-elasticnetpredictionofiqfrommmpiintheves.png" id="_T0P3KUgb" data-link-icon="image" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-filesize-bytes="72272" data-filesize-percentage="13" data-image-height="1080" data-image-width="1464" data-aspect-ratio="1400 / 1033">“Elastic net prediction of <em>g</em>: <em>r</em> = 0.83 (0.82–0.84), <em>n</em> = 4,320”</a></p>
<p>[There are 203 (elastic)/217 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)" id="_Zk9ZgDXA" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics)#bodyContent" title="Lasso (statistics)">lasso</a>) non-zero coefficients out of 556]</p>
<p>Thus, one can measure <em>g</em> as well as one could with a decent test like Wonderlic, or Raven’s without having any cognitive data at all! The big question here is whether these models generalize well. If one can train a model to predict <em>g</em> from MMPI items in dataset 1, and then apply it to dataset 2 without much loss of accuracy, this means that one could impute <em>g</em> in potentially thousands of old archival datasets that include the same MMPI items, or a subset of them.</p>

<p>When conducting research on large data sets, statistically-significant findings having only trivial interpretive meaning may appear. Little consensus exists whether such small effects can be meaningfully interpreted. The current analysis examines the possibility that trivial effects may emerge in large datasets, but that some such effects may lack interpretive value. When such results match an investigator’s hypothesis, they may be over-interpreted.</p>
<p>The current study examines this issue as related to aggression research in 2 large samples. Specifically, in the first study, the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) dataset was used. 15 variables with little theoretical relevance to aggression were selected, then correlated with self-reported delinquency. For the second study, the Understanding Society database was used. As with Study 1, 14 nonsensical variables were correlated with conduct problems.</p>
<p>Many variables achieved “statistical-significance” and some effect-sizes approached or exceeded <em>r</em> = 0.10, despite little theoretical relevance between the variables.</p>
<p>It is recommended that effect sizes below <em>r</em> = 0.10 should not be interpreted as hypothesis supportive.</p>

The ℓ<sub>1</sub> methods assume that the truth is sparse, in some basis. If the assumption holds true, then the parameters can be efficiently estimated using ℓ<sub>1</sub> penalties. If the assumption does not hold—so that the truth is dense—then no method will be able to recover the underlying model without a large amount of data per parameter. This is typically not the case when <em>p</em> ≫ <em>N</em>, a commonly occurring scenario.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This can be seen as a kind of decision-theoretic justification for Occam-style assumptions: if the real world is not predictable in the sense of being predictable by simple/fast algorithms, or induction doesn’t work at all, then no method works in expectation, and the “regret” (difference between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value" id="_4Jur8wYN" data-link-icon="wikipedia" data-link-icon-type="svg" data-url-iframe="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value#bodyContent" title="Expected value">expected value</a> of actual decision and expected value of optimal decision) from mistakenly assuming that the world is simple/sparse is zero. So one should assume the world is simple.<a href="#fnref2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn4"><p>The most interesting example of this is ESP/psi parapsychology research: the more rigorously conducted the ESP experiments are, the smaller the effects become—but, while discrediting all claims of human ESP, frequently they aren’t pushed to <em>exactly</em> zero and are “statistically-significant”. <a href="https://gwern.net/modus" id="gwern-modus" data-filesize-bytes="110019" data-filesize-percentage="58" title="'One Man’s Modus Ponens', Gwern 2012">There must be</a> some residual crud factor in the experiments, even when conducted &amp; analyzed as best as we know how.<a href="#fnref4" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn10"><p>I would note there is <a href="https://gwern.net/note/statistic#expectations-are-not-expected-deviations-and-large-number-of-variables-are-not-large-samples" id="gwern-note-statistic--expectations-are-not-expected-deviations-and-large-number-of-variables-are-not-large-samples" data-filesize-bytes="456894" data-filesize-percentage="88">a dangerous fallacy here</a> even if one does believe the Law of Large Numbers should apply here with an expectation of zero effect: even if the expectation of the pairwise correlation of 2 arbitrary variables was in fact precisely zero (as is not too implausible in some domains such as optimization or feedback loops—such as the famous example of the thermostat/room-temperature), that does not mean any specific pair will be exactly zero no matter how many numbers get added up to create their relationship, as the absolute size of the deviation increases.</p>
<p>So for example, imagine 2 genetic traits which may be genetically-correlated, and their heritability may be caused by a number of genes ranging from 1 (monogenic) to tens of thousands (highly polygenic); the specific overlap is created by a chance draw of evolutionary processes throughout the organism’s evolution; does the Law of Large Numbers justify saying that while 2 monogenic traits may have a substantial correlation, 2 highly polygenic traits must have much closer to zero correlation simply because they are influenced by more genes? No, because the distribution around the expectation of 0 can become wider &amp; wider the more relevant genes there are.</p>
<p>To reason otherwise is, as Samuelson noted, to think like an insurer who is worried about losing $100 on an insurance contract so it goes out &amp; makes 100 more $100 contracts.<a href="#fnref10" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>

                        Most electronic shopping cart wheels listen for a 7.8 kHz signal from an underground wire to know when to lock and unlock. A management remote can send a different signal at 7.8 kHz to the wheel to unlock it.
        
                        Since 7.8 kHz is in the audio range, you can use the parasitic EMF from your phone's speaker to "transmit" a similar code by playing a crafted audio file.

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>This 31st annual Institute for Policy Studies Executive Excess report takes an in-depth look at the 100 S&amp;P 500 corporations with the lowest median worker pay, a group we have dubbed the “Low-Wage 100.” For each of these companies, we analyze CEO and worker pay trends since 2019. We also compare, for the past six years, what these companies have spent on stock buybacks to pump up short-term share prices with what they have invested in long-term capital improvements.</p>



<p>The report’s overall finding: At a time when many American workers are struggling with high costs for groceries and housing, the nation’s largest low-wage employers are fixated on making their overpaid CEOs even richer.</p>



<p>Our analysis ends with realizable policy solutions for pushing Corporate America in a more equitable direction.</p>



<p>For detailed analysis , including our methodology, see the full PDF below. A summary follows.</p>


            
        


<div>
<h2>Key findings</h2>



<ol>
<li><strong>CEO pay at Low-Wage 100 firms has soared since 2019 while median worker pay has lagged behind U.S. inflation.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Between 2019 and 2024, average CEO compensation within this group rose 34.7 percent in nominal — unadjusted for inflation — terms, more than double the 16.3 percent increase in these firms’ average median worker pay. The U.S. inflation rate over this same period: 22.6 percent.</li>



<li>Average CEO compensation within the Low-Wage 100 hit $17.2 million in 2024. The group’s average median worker pay sat at just $35,570.</li>



<li><strong>The average CEO-worker pay ratio of Low-Wage 100 firms has widened by 12.9 percent, from 560 to 1 in 2019 to 632 to 1 in 2024.</strong></li>



<li><strong>The nominal value of median pay actually <em>fell</em> at 22 Low-Wage 100 corporations during this period.</strong></li>



<li><strong>The Starbucks pay gap hit 6,666 to 1 last year</strong>, the Low-Wage 100’s widest spread by far. In 2024, the Starbucks CEO pocketed $95.8 million.<strong> </strong>Over the past six years, amid worker discontent fueling union-organizing drives at hundreds of Starbucks stores, the firm’s median pay rose just 4.2 percent in real terms to $14,674. Only seven S&amp;P 500 firms have lower median pay.</li>



<li><strong>Ulta Beauty reported the Low-Wage 100’s steepest drop in median pay</strong>. Between 2019 and 2024, a period when the cosmetic retailer significantly expanded the part-time worker share of its workforce, the company’s real median pay plunged by 46 percent to $11,078.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>From 2019 through 2024, the Low-Wage 100 spent $644 billion on stock buybacks.</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Over the past six years, all but three Low-Wage 100 firms spent corporate dollars on stock buybacks</strong>. By repurchasing their own shares, companies artificially inflate executive stock-based pay and siphon resources out of worker wages and productive long-term investments.</li>



<li><strong>Lowe’s ranks as the Low-Wage 100’s buyback leader. The company spent $46.6 billion on share repurchases from 2019 through 2024</strong>. Over that span, this sum could have funded an annual $28,456 bonus for each of the firm’s 273,000 employees — or added 88 employees to each of the firm’s retail outlets. <strong>In 2024, Lowe’s CEO Marvin Ellison enjoyed a total compensation of $20.2 million —</strong> <strong>659 times more than the retailer’s $30,606 median annual worker pay</strong>.</li>



<li><strong>Home Depot currently sits second in the Low-Wage 100 buyback rankings</strong>. The big-box chain spent $37.9 billion on share repurchases between 2019 and 2024. That outlay would have been enough to give each of Home Depot’s 470,100 global employees six annual $13,423 bonuses. The Home Depot median pay: just $35,196.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>From 2019 through 2024, a majority of Low-Wage 100 firms spent more on stock buybacks than on long-term capital expenditures.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Over the past six years, <strong>56 Low-Wage 100 companies plowed more corporate cash into buying back their own shares of stock than investing in capital improvements</strong>.</li>



<li>If we exclude capital expenditure outlier Amazon from the calculation, <strong>the Low-Wage 100 as a whole spent more on buybacks than on “CapEx” during this period</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>At least 32 billionaires owe their wealth to Low-Wage 100 companies.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Five of these firms have spawned multiple billionaires still living today: Walmart (eight), Estee Lauder (four), DoorDash (three), Public Storage (two), and Tyson Foods (two).</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Policy changes can prevent wasteful stock buybacks and excessive CEO payouts.</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Taxing extreme CEO-worker pay gaps: </strong>In<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.filesforprogress.org/datasets/2024/4/dfp_progressive_leg_agenda_tabs.pdf">one recent survey</a>, 80 percent of likely voters expressed support for a tax hike on corporations that pay their CEO over 50 or more times what they pay their median employees.</li>



<li><strong>Increasing the buybacks tax:</strong> If Congress in 2022 had set our current <a href="https://inequality.org/research/congress-takes-historic-step-to-tax-stock-buybacks/">1 percent excise tax</a> on stock buybacks at 4 percent, the Low-Wage 100 would have owed approximately $6.3 billion in additional federal taxes on share repurchases in 2023 and 2024.</li>



<li><strong>Restricting buybacks and CEO pay through federal contracts and subsidies:</strong> The Biden administration made modest progress on this front through the CHIPS semiconductor subsidy program. But the federal government could be doing much more to leverage the power of the public purse against wasteful stock buybacks and excessive CEO pay.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</div>



<h2><strong>Recommendations</strong></h2>



<p>We highlight three particularly promising areas for CEO pay policy reform.</p>



<h4>Subjecting corporations with excessive levels of CEO pay to higher tax levies.</h4>



<p>Higher tax rates on companies with wide CEO-worker pay gaps would create an incentive to both rein in executive pay and raise worker wages, all the while generating significant new capital for vital public investments. Laws that share those goals are already generating revenue in <a href="https://inequality.org/action/corporate-pay-equity/">two major cities</a>, San Francisco and Portland, Oregon.</p>



<p>Members of the U.S. Congress have also introduced several related bills, including:</p>



<p>The<strong> Curtailing Executive Overcompensation (CEO) Act: </strong>This <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/3176">bill</a> applies an excise tax to publicly traded and private companies with CEO-to-median-worker pay disparities that run over 50 to 1. Under this excise tax formula, the tax owed would be proportional to the degree a company’s pay ratio exceeds 50 to 1 and to the level of the CEO’s compensation. In other words, companies with large pay gaps would owe extra taxes — and those companies with extremely high CEO pay would owe Uncle Sam even more.</p>



<p>Revenue estimate: This bill, had it been in effect in 2022, would have raised <a href="https://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/news/release/whitehouse-lee-ocasio-cortez-introduce-legislation-to-increase-worker-pay-rein-in-runaway-ceo-compensation/">over $10 billion</a> in annual revenue from the <em>Fortune</em> 100 largest U.S. companies alone.</p>



<p>The<strong> Tax Excessive CEO Pay Act:</strong> This <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/3620?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22Tax+Excessive+CEO+Pay+Act%22%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=3">legislation</a> ties a company’s federal corporate tax rate to the size of the gap between its CEO and median worker pay. Tax penalties would begin at 0.5 percentage points for companies that pay their top executives between 50 and 100 times more than their median workers. The highest penalty would apply to companies that pay top executives over 500 times worker pay.</p>



<p>Revenue estimate: <a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/news-sanders-and-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-combat-corporate-greed-and-end-outrageous-ceo-pay-2/">$150 billion over 10 years</a>. The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3301">CEO Accountability and Responsibility Act</a> imposes similar tax penalties for large ratios and ties the pay ratio to government contracting.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.filesforprogress.org/datasets/2024/4/dfp_progressive_leg_agenda_tabs.pdf">May 2024 survey</a> suggests that such taxes would be enormously popular. Overall, 80 percent of likely voters favor a tax hike on corporations that pay their CEOs over 50 or more times more than what they pay their median employees.</p>



<h4>Taxing and restricting stock buybacks.</h4>



<p>A <a href="https://inequality.org/research/congress-takes-historic-step-to-tax-stock-buybacks/">1 percent federal excise tax</a> on the repurchase of corporate stock went into effect in 2023. With nearly $209 billion in combined stock buybacks for 2023 and 2024, the Low-Wage 100 owed approximately $2.1 billion in federal taxes over those two years.</p>



<p>A Senate bill, the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/413?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22chamberActionDateCode%3A%5C%222023-02-14%7C118%7C10000%5C%22+AND+billIsReserved%3A%5C%22N%5C%22%22%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=16">Stock Buyback Accountability Act</a>, would quadruple this excise tax. If that 4 percent tax had been in place in 2023 and 2024, the Low-Wage 100 would have owed approximately $6.3 billion in additional federal taxes on their share repurchases, assuming no change in their buyback behavior. That increase would be enough to cover the cost of <a href="https://www.nationalpriorities.org/interactive-data/trade-offs/?state=00&amp;program=111111">327,218</a> public housing units each year for two years.</p>



<p>Another Senate bill, the<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2023/3/warner-introduces-legislation-to-encourages-companies-to-prioritize-long-term-investments-over-short-term-gains-by-instituting-holding-periods-for-stock-buybacks">ALIGN Act</a>, would ban executives from selling their shares within a year of a stock buyback announcement. This would prevent CEOs from timing share repurchases to cash in personally on a short-term price pop they themselves have artificially created.</p>



<h4>Using federal contracts and subsidies to discourage wide corporate pay gaps.</h4>



<p>The Biden administration took several steps to use the power of the public purse to discourage CEO pay-inflating stock buybacks. During the Biden White House years, the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2023/02/28/CHIPS_NOFO-1_Fact_Sheet_0.pdf">Department of Commerce</a> gave preferential treatment in the awarding of $39 billion in CHIPS subsidies for domestic semiconductor production to firms that committed to refraining from all stock buybacks for five years.</p>



<p>Future administrations could do much more to leverage the power of the public purse against extreme pay disparities. The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4186?s=1&amp;r=5#:~:text=Introduced%20in%20House%20(06%2F25%2F2021)&amp;text=This%20bill%20establishes%20new%20requirements,taxes%2C%20and%20private%20equity%20firms.">Patriotic Corporations Act</a> could serve as a model. This bill would grant preferential treatment in federal contracting to firms with CEO-worker pay ratios of 100 to 1 or less, among other benchmarks. The <a href="https://progressives.house.gov/_cache/files/6/8/68a45450-d818-4c0c-a564-cd85ea395d47/88561AA25D995B4AF31FCC6F40CA177D.cpc-recommendations-for-executive-action-3-17-22.pdf">Congressional Progressive Caucus</a> has supported such incentives.</p>



<p>By encouraging major corporations to narrow their pay gaps, a president can also help ensure that taxpayers get the biggest bang for federal contract bucks. <a href="https://inequality.org/action/corporate-pay-equity/#academic-research">Studies have shown</a> that companies with narrow gaps in CEO-worker compensation tend to perform at higher levels than firms with wide gaps.</p>
