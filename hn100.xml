  <div><p>EFF is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Mark Klein, a bona fide hero who risked civil liability and criminal prosecution to help expose a massive spying program that violated the rights of millions of Americans.</p>
<p>Mark didn’t set out to change the world. For 22 years, he was a telecommunications technician for AT&amp;T, most of that in San Francisco. But he always had a strong sense of right and wrong and a commitment to privacy.</p>
<p><span>Mark not only saw how it works, he had the documents to prove it.</span></p>
<p>When the New York Times reported in late 2005 that the NSA was engaging in spying inside the U.S., Mark realized that he had witnessed how it was happening. He also realized that the President was not telling Americans the truth about the program. And, though newly retired, he knew that he had to do something. He showed up at EFF’s front door in early 2006 with a simple question: “Do you folks care about privacy?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>We did. And what Mark told us changed everything. Through his work, Mark had learned that the National Security Agency (NSA) had installed a secret, secure room at AT&amp;T’s central office in San Francisco, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_641A">Room 641A</a>. Mark was assigned to connect circuits carrying Internet data to optical “splitters” that sat just outside of the secret NSA room but were hardwired into it. Those splitters—as well as similar ones in cities around the U.S.—<a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2014/07/24/backbone-3c-color.jpg">made a copy</a> of all data going through those circuits and delivered it into the secret room.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://www.eff.org/files/2025/03/12/secretroom1_f.jpg" width="500" height="373" alt="Photo of NSA-controlled &quot;secret room&quot; " title="Photo of NSA-controlled &quot;secret room&quot; "></p></div>
<p>Mark not only saw how it works, he had the documents to prove it. He brought us over a hundred pages of authenticated AT&amp;T schematic diagrams and tables. Mark also shared this information with major media outlets, numerous Congressional staffers, and at least two senators personally. One, Senator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pylu8ycLfC4">Chris Dodd</a>, took the floor of the Senate to acknowledge Mark as the great American hero he was.</p>
<p>We used Mark’s evidence to bring two lawsuits against the <a href="https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying">NSA spying</a> that he uncovered. The first was <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/hepting">Hepting v. AT&amp;T</a> and the second was <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/jewel">Jewel v. NSA</a>. Mark also came with us to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/07/us/07nsa.html">Washington D.C</a>. to push for an end to the spying and demand accountability for it happening in secret for so many years.&nbsp; He wrote an account of his experience called <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6625940-wiring-up-the-big-brother-machine-and-fighting-it"><em>Wiring Up the Big Brother Machine . . . And Fighting It</em>.</a></p>
<div><p><img src="https://www.eff.org/files/2025/03/12/mark-klein-washington.jpg" width="1284" height="633" alt="cartoon featuring Mark Klein climbing Capitol Hill" title="cartoon featuring Mark Klein climbing Capitol Hill"></p><p>Archival EFF graphic promoting Mark Klein's DC tour</p></div>
<p>Mark stood up and told the truth at great personal risk to himself and his family. AT&amp;T threatened to sue him, although it wisely decided not to do so. While we were able to use his evidence to make some change, both EFF and Mark were ultimately let down by Congress and the Courts, which have refused to take the steps necessary to end the mass spying even after Edward Snowden provided even more evidence of it in 2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Mark certainly inspired all of us at EFF, and he helped inspire and inform hundreds of thousands of ordinary Americans to demand an end to illegal mass surveillance. While we have not yet seen the success in ending the spying that we all have hoped for, his bravery helped to usher numerous reforms so far.</p>
<p>And the fight is not over. The law, <a href="https://www.eff.org/702-spying">called Section 702</a>, that now authorizes the continued surveillance that Mark first revealed, expires in early 2026. EFF and others will continue to push for continued reforms and, ultimately, for the illegal spying to end entirely.</p>
<p>Mark’s legacy lives on in our continuing fights to reform surveillance and honor the Fourth Amendment’s promise of protecting personal privacy. We are forever grateful to him for having the courage to stand up and will do our best to honor that legacy by continuing the fight.&nbsp;</p>

  <p data-block-key="q2c97">Introducing Gemini Robotics, our Gemini 2.0-based model designed for robotics</p><p data-block-key="3djrg">At Google DeepMind, we've been making progress in how our Gemini models solve complex problems through multimodal reasoning across text, images, audio and video. So far however, those abilities have been largely confined to the digital realm. In order for AI to be useful and helpful to people in the physical realm, they have to demonstrate “embodied” reasoning — the humanlike ability to comprehend and react to the world around us— as well as safely take action to get things done.</p><p data-block-key="73qu7">Today, we are introducing two new AI models, based on Gemini 2.0, which lay the foundation for a new generation of helpful robots.</p><p data-block-key="4he0s">The first is Gemini Robotics, an advanced vision-language-action (VLA) model that was built on Gemini 2.0 with the addition of physical actions as a new output modality for the purpose of directly controlling robots. The second is Gemini Robotics-ER, a Gemini model with advanced spatial understanding, enabling roboticists to run their own programs using Gemini’s embodied reasoning (ER) abilities.</p><p data-block-key="dtsn7">Both of these models enable a variety of robots to perform a wider range of real-world tasks than ever before. As part of our efforts, we’re partnering with Apptronik to build the next generation of humanoid robots with Gemini 2.0. We’re also working with a selected number of trusted testers to guide the future of Gemini Robotics-ER.</p><p data-block-key="im3d">We look forward to exploring our models’ capabilities and continuing to develop them on the path to real-world applications.</p>

  <h2 data-block-key="2q7pg">Gemini Robotics: Our most advanced vision-language-action model</h2><p data-block-key="3d8qf">To be useful and helpful to people, AI models for robotics need three principal qualities: they have to be general, meaning they’re able to adapt to different situations; they have to be interactive, meaning they can understand and respond quickly to instructions or changes in their environment; and they have to be dexterous, meaning they can do the kinds of things people generally can do with their hands and fingers, like carefully manipulate objects.</p><p data-block-key="5bthq">While our previous work demonstrated progress in these areas, Gemini Robotics represents a substantial step in performance on all three axes, getting us closer to truly general purpose robots.</p><p data-block-key="2bhs2"><strong>Generality</strong></p><p data-block-key="at04h">Gemini Robotics leverages Gemini's world understanding to generalize to novel situations and solve a wide variety of tasks out of the box, including tasks it has never seen before in training. Gemini Robotics is also adept at dealing with new objects, diverse instructions, and new environments. In <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemini-robotics/gemini_robotics_report.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our tech report</a>, we show that on average, Gemini Robotics more than doubles performance on a comprehensive generalization benchmark compared to other state-of-the-art vision-language-action models.</p>

It taps into Gemini’s advanced language understanding capabilities and can understand and respond to commands phrased in everyday, conversational language and in different languages.</p><p data-block-key="eo201">It can understand and respond to a much broader set of natural language instructions than our previous models, adapting its behavior to your input.

  <h2 data-block-key="2q7pg">Enhancing Gemini’s world understanding</h2><p data-block-key="f1glf"><br>Alongside Gemini Robotics, we’re introducing an advanced vision-language model called Gemini Robotics-ER (short for ‘“embodied reasoning”). This model enhances Gemini’s understanding of the world in ways necessary for robotics, focusing especially on spatial reasoning, and allows roboticists to connect it with their existing low level controllers.</p><p data-block-key="6k4gb">Gemini Robotics-ER improves Gemini 2.0’s existing abilities like pointing and 3D detection by a large margin. Combining spatial reasoning and Gemini’s coding abilities, Gemini Robotics-ER can instantiate entirely new capabilities on the fly. For example, when shown a coffee mug, the model can intuit an appropriate two-finger grasp for picking it up by the handle and a safe trajectory for approaching it.</p><p data-block-key="1lam2">Gemini Robotics-ER can perform all the steps necessary to control a robot right out of the box, including perception, state estimation, spatial understanding, planning and code generation. In such an end-to-end setting the model achieves a 2x-3x success rate compared to Gemini 2.0. And where code generation is not sufficient, Gemini Robotics-ER can even tap into the power of in-context learning, following the patterns of a handful of human demonstrations to provide a solution.</p>

  <h2 data-block-key="2q7pg">Responsibly advancing AI and robotics<br></h2><p data-block-key="16hbn">As we explore the continuing potential of AI and robotics, we’re taking a layered, <a href="https://sites.google.com/corp/view/safe-robots" rel="noopener" target="_blank">holistic</a> approach to addressing safety in our research, from low-level motor control to high-level semantic understanding.</p><p data-block-key="7s8sj">The physical safety of robots and the people around them is a longstanding, foundational concern in the science of robotics. That's why roboticists have classic safety measures such as avoiding collisions, limiting the magnitude of contact forces, and ensuring the dynamic stability of mobile robots. Gemini Robotics-ER can be interfaced with these ‘low-level’ safety-critical controllers, specific to each particular embodiment. Building on Gemini’s core safety features, we enable Gemini Robotics-ER models to understand whether or not a potential action is safe to perform in a given context, and to generate appropriate responses.</p><p data-block-key="3dcnu">To advance robotics safety research across academia and industry, we are also releasing a new dataset to evaluate and improve semantic safety in embodied AI and robotics. In previous work, we showed how a <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/shaping-the-future-of-advanced-robotics/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Robot Constitution</a> inspired by Isaac Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics could help prompt an LLM to select safer tasks for robots. We have since developed a framework to automatically generate data-driven constitutions - rules expressed directly in natural language – to steer a robot’s behavior. This framework would allow people to create, modify and apply constitutions to develop robots that are safer and more aligned with human values. Finally, the <a href="https://asimov-benchmark.github.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new ASIMOV dataset</a> will help researchers to rigorously measure the safety implications of robotic actions in real-world scenarios.</p><p data-block-key="ch213">To further assess the societal implications of our work, we collaborate with experts in our Responsible Development and Innovation team and as well as our Responsibility and Safety Council, an internal review group committed to ensure we develop AI applications responsibly. We also consult with external specialists on particular challenges and opportunities presented by embodied AI in robotics applications.</p><p data-block-key="cis52">In addition to our partnership with Apptronik, our Gemini Robotics-ER model is also available to trusted testers including Agile Robots, Agility Robots, Boston Dynamics, and Enchanted Tools. We look forward to exploring our models’ capabilities and continuing to develop AI for the next generation of more helpful robots.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="World's First Ammonia-Fueled Ship Hits a Snag"><p>The <em><a href="https://www.equinor.com/news/20240826-worlds-first-ammonia-powered-supply-vessel" target="_blank">Viking Energy</a></em>, an oil platform supply ship<strong></strong>undergoing a pioneering retrofit to run on <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ammonia">ammonia</a> fuel, is now scheduled to begin operations in 2026—two years later than initially planned. Once completed, it will be the first vessel capable of operating full-time on ammonia, marking a major milestone in efforts to reduce <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/carbon-dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions in the maritime industry.</p><p><em>IEEE Spectrum</em> previously reported on ammonia as a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/why-the-shipping-industry-is-betting-big-on-ammonia" target="_blank">potential replacement</a> for <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/petroleum">petroleum</a> fuels in the shipping industry in 2021, at which time key stakeholders—including Norwegian energy <a href="https://www.equinor.com/about-us/our-history" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">giant Equinor</a>, technology provider <a href="https://www.wartsila.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wärtsilä</a>, and shipping company <a href="https://eidesvik.no/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Eidesvik Offshore</a>—expected the <em><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/viking">Viking</a> Energy</em> to set sail in 2024. However, progress has slowed.</p><p>Industry experts attribute the delay to the complex infrastructure required to handle ammonia safely. “Ammonia is toxic, explosive, and corrosive. We must use special piping, storage tanks, and trucks outfitted with materials engineered to be both leakproof and resistant to ammonia’s corrosive properties,” says <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/port-electrification" target="_self">John Prousalidis</a>, a professor of marine engineering at the <a href="https://www.ntua.gr/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Technical University of Athens</a>. </p><p>A spokesperson for Wärtsilä told<em> IEEE Spectrum</em>  that the delay has not been related to performance or safety issues, but to “ the challenges of being at the forefront of maritime decarbonization.” The spokesperson explains that the project “was <span>originally the demonstrator in the EU-funded <a href="https://www.clean-hydrogen.europa.eu/projects-dashboard/projects-repository/shipfc_en" target="_blank">ShipFC</a> Clean <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/hydrogen">Hydrogen</a> Partnership program, which aimed to install a 2-megawatt ammonia-powered fuel cell onboard.” But because </span><span> logistics for the production of solid oxide <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/fuel-cells">fuel cells</a> for this application did not mature as quickly as anticipated, the EU organizers put “a temporary pause” on the retrofit. The 2024 deadline was no longer feasible, but the partnership restarted the project with a specially made <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/gas-turbine">gas turbine</a> designed to run on ammonia.</span></p><p><span>When working with first-of-their-kind technologies, timelines can shift — but the ambition remains the same: to make ammonia a viable zero-carbon fuel for the maritime industry,” says the Wärtsilä spokesperson.</span></p><p>Being first comes with a set of challenges that must be overcome. One of the biggest environmental concerns with ammonia-powered ships is the potential release of nitrogen oxides. “Instead of CO<sub>2</sub>, which contributes to <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/global-warming">global warming</a>, we could end up with nitrogen oxides, which are lethal to breathe,” says Prousalidis. “To avoid simply swapping one pollutant for another, ammonia propulsion systems must include emissions-control technologies to prevent harmful nitrogen oxides from entering the atmosphere,” he adds.</p><p>A promising alternative to combustion engines is ammonia-powered fuel cells like the one originally slated to power the <em>Viking Energy.</em> Fuel cells generate electricity without producing nitrogen oxide emissions. By avoiding combustion entirely, these fuel cells allow ammonia’s nitrogen content to remain in its inert form, eliminating a key health risk.</p><h2>Ammonia Fuel Delays for <em>Viking Energy</em></h2><p>Despite the challenges, experts believe ammonia could become a mainstream maritime fuel—but not overnight. “Twenty or thirty years ago, the shipping industry made a major shift to <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/natural-gas">natural gas</a>, believing it was the fuel of the future. Now, we know it wasn’t the right step,” says Prousalidis.</p><p>Looking back at past fuel transitions, he noted that each shift—from steam to oil, and then to natural gas—took around 20 years to achieve full adoption. He expects a similar timeline for the adoption of ammonia or hydrogen. “We need to be patient while persisting in our efforts and not getting discouraged by early challenges.”</p><p>That perspective aligns with what Equinor’s vice president of renewable and low-carbon technology, Henriette Undrum, told <em>IEEE Spectrum</em> in 2021 when she urged the public to be patient: “We are not just solving one small problem for one ship. It’s part of the bigger picture. It will be a starting point to build up the market for zero-carbon fuels.”</p><p><img alt="The Viking Energy platform supply vessel out at sea." data-rm-shortcode-id="b52ecb33293c195f29b836637393dcb6" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/the-viking-energy-platform-supply-vessel-out-at-sea.jpg?id=56650806&amp;width=980" height="1446" id="1381b" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/the-viking-energy-platform-supply-vessel-out-at-sea.jpg?id=56650806&amp;width=980" width="2314"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Eidesvik’s ammonia-powered Viking Energy is now slated to ship out in 2026.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Eidesvik</small></p><p><span>As ammonia and hydrogen gain traction as maritime fuels, seaports could play a pivotal role in in solving ammonia’s chicken-and-egg problem. Energy companies are wary of investing in alternative fuel infrastructure when there aren’t any ships that run on the new fuel, and shipbuilders are want to avoid shelling out hundreds of millions of dollars to build vessels for which there is no steady fuel supply.</span></p><p>“Seaports are already undergoing an energy transformation,” says Prousalidis. “It would make sense for them to operate as energy hubs—producing, storing, and trading <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/alternative-fuels">alternative fuels</a> for fuel cells and other power-generation devices.” By doing so, he says, ports could turn a profit while also breaking the stalemate and contributing to global <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/decarbonization">decarbonization</a> efforts.</p><p>Although concerns about nitrogen oxide emissions remain, companies <span>including the partnership that is retrofitting the  Viking Energy<strong></strong></span>are reportedly designing post-combustion systems, analogous to the catalytic converters in automobile exhaust systems, to filter out harmful byproducts.  A technique called selective catalytic reduction converts nitrogen oxides into nitrogen and water. Ammonia slip catalysts capture unburned ammonia and break it down into the same two inert products. </p><p>Meanwhile, momentum for ammonia- based propulsion continues to build. <a href="https://www.hanwha.com/companies/hanwha-ocean.do" target="_blank">Hanwha Ocean</a>, a shipbuilder based in Geoje, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/south-korea">South Korea</a> and Houston-based energy technology company Baker Hughes have announced <a href="https://investors.bakerhughes.com/news-releases/news-release-details/baker-hughes-and-hanwha-announce-partnership-develop-small-size" target="_blank">a partnership to develop a commercial ammonia-compatible propulsion system</a> by 2027. The companies are working on <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/gas-turbines">gas turbines</a> capable of running on 100 percent ammonia, with dual-fuel options for natural gas.</p></div></div>]]></description>

          As passionate supporters of Mozilla and its mission, we want to
          express our thoughts on the current landscape, especially in light of
          the ongoing <em>U.S. v. Google LLC</em> case and its implications for
          Mozilla’s search partnerships. While Mozilla has always championed
          user privacy and an open web, the increasing reliance on Google for
          revenue raises important questions about our shared commitment to
          these values.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now is the time for Mozilla to take bold steps to reinforce its
          identity as a privacy-centric nonprofit and to prioritize the Firefox
          browser as the heart of your mission.
        </p>

        <h2 id="embrace-independence">Embrace Independence</h2>

        <p>
          It is time to reevaluate the partnership with Google and seek
          alternatives that align with Mozilla’s values. By distancing itself
          from Google, Mozilla can reaffirm its commitment to user privacy and
          autonomy, fostering trust among its user base.
        </p>

        <h2 id="focus-on-firefox">Focus on Firefox</h2>

        <p>
          The Firefox browser has been a cornerstone of Mozilla’s identity. By
          concentrating resources and innovation on enhancing Firefox, you can
          improve user experience, performance, and privacy features. This focus
          will not only attract new users but also retain existing ones who
          value a browser that prioritizes their needs.
        </p>

        <h2 id="privacy-first">Sustainable, Privacy-First Ventures</h2>

        <p>
          Firefox needs new revenue streams to be sustainable. New products and
          services under Mozilla’s umbrella should reflect the same commitment
          to privacy that defines Mozilla. By prioritizing user-friendly,
          privacy-respecting practices, you can strengthen your reputation as a
          leader in the digital rights movement.
        </p>

        

        <p>
          Mozilla thrives on the passion and creativity of its community. By
          actively involving users and developers in the conversation, you can
          gather valuable insights and foster a sense of shared ownership in the
          future of Mozilla.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <p>
          The future of Mozilla depends on its ability to remain true to its
          founding principles. By taking decisive action to reinforce your
          commitment to privacy and focusing on the Firefox browser, you can
          continue to lead the way in creating a better internet for everyone.
        </p>

<p>Gemma is a lightweight, family of models from Google built on Gemini technology. The Gemma 3 models are multimodal—processing text and images—and feature a 128K context window with support for over 140 languages. Available in 1B, 4B, 12B, and 27B parameter sizes, they excel in tasks like question answering, summarization, and reasoning, while their compact design allows deployment on resource-limited devices.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div class="page">
  
  <p><span>2025-03-11 18:34:41</span>
  <span>Displayed 18233 times</span></p>
  <p>I've been a good student for 5 years at a French computer school. I've been a good freelance developer for 20 years. I've used Ruby on Rails exclusively however never writing my own code always for clients.</p>
<p>One day I learned Common Lisp. It was supposed to be a short mission I thought I could learn Common Lisp in ten days and hack a quick server management protocol. I ended up writing throw-away Common Lisp code that generated C for a fully-fledged ASN.1 parser and query system for a custom Common Lisp to C SNMP server.</p>
<p>Years later I wrote more and more Common Lisp code and ended up writing cl-unix-cybernetics which has the most stars on Github of all my repos there, and cl-streams and cl-cffi, and finally cl-facts which is a triple store that can be used as a Common Lisp graph database. The results were astonishing : very fast, atomic transactions, nestable transactions, compatible with unwind-protect, only 3 macros to learn and you're all set. Cl-facts was presented as a lightning talk at ELS (European Lisp Symposium) in Belgium. Slides for my talk there is available, see the <a href="https://www.kmx.io/">front page</a>.</p>
<p>Writing all these Common Lisp packages took a long time and I was loosing all my clients. I did not care, Common Lisp was awesome and a tool for future generations for sure.</p>
<p>However I also had a lot of echoes around me of people failing where Theo de Raadt and others had said they were wrong. Virtual machines still suck a lot of CPU and bandwidth for nothing but emulation. Containers in Linux with cgroups are still full of RCE (remote command execution) and priviledge escalation. New ones are discovered each year. The first report I got on those listed 10 or more RCE + PE (remote root on the machine). Remote root can also escape VMs probably also. You do have backups right ? So it kept me centered on OpenBSD and avoided me the hell that most DevOps faced : Terraform, Ansible and such. So I saw people angry with VMs and containers and also people angry with their very programming language. Like Clojure : who can write a strategy game with thousands of units each having their own vision of the world, without having a garbage collector running like hell ? In fact my friend went away and tried to write the game and failed. Garbage collectors suck, and all my Common Lisp projects have very limited applications just because of the garbage collector. And we all know it's a commercial argument to the jVM : it has one of the best GCs around and it did cost a lot to write correctly. I guess it was not written in a one time scratch</p>
<p>So I thought OK I have a killer app but no-one will run it because it's in Common Lisp. The only rational solution for performance and portability reasons, unless another tool is developed for these specific purpose like C, is C. Linux is written in C, OpenBSD is written in C, GTK+ is object-oriented pure C, GNOME is written in C. Most of the Linux desktop apps are actually written in plain old C. So why try harder ? I know C.</p>
<p>So I started writing my <strong>libc3</strong> utility library, which would become a language (<strong>C3</strong>) with an interpreter (<strong>ic3</strong>) but could also be compiled (<strong>c3c</strong>) if we did manage to get it through at some point; and data structures emerged from UTF-8 buffers and the other way around pretty fast and all was bounds-checked at memory cost but the results were awesome. Defensive programming all the way : all bugs are reduced to zero right from the start. The system has been maintained clean of wrong bugs all of the time. There are no security implications of running KC3 code. So very fast a small interpreter was born, pumping <strong>tags</strong> (an enum-tagged union of all datatypes of the language) in a REPL (read eval print loop).</p>
<p>3 years later I just finished a 5 layered refactor and all the tests pass again and the webserver seems to not be broken again. The language was renamed from C3 to KC3 as the original name was already taken. So what do we have ?</p>
<p>I had already ported the graph database (<strong>cl-facts</strong>) to C89 and though a couple of bugs remained at the time of import pretty much all the database was written during the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020. Everything was there : add a triple, remove a triple, the recursive query system, transactions, logging and persistence. Pixel perfect implementation of my original design in Common Lisp but in plain old C89 which I remembered quite well.</p>
<p>Besides the graph data base I also wrote parsers and generators to get formal semantics for all algorithmic types I know of and could write in such a short amount of time : Structs, Linked lists, Maps, Hash tables, Time, Complex, Rationals, Tuples, Code blocks, Quotes, Unquotes, Copy on write, Skip lists, Sets, etc. I have macros like I explain in my other article. I'll do a follow up with some examples of macros. I was very much inspired by the awesome work of José Valim and Elixir. See Fly.io's blog if you want to read José Valim !</p>
<p>I have a REPL (<strong>ikc3</strong>) which parses keyboard or file input and outputs all results of a KC3 evaluation to the console (standard output). It is used for most of the second phase of unit testing KC3.</p>
<p>I have a webserver with an MVC framework which is producing the very webpage you're reading : <strong>kc3_httpd</strong>.</p>
<p>I have 700 views on a Common Lisp article which is crazy I did not think Common Lisp had so many followers.</p>
<p>I have a documentation website all written using <strong>kc3_httpd</strong> and a vamped Markdown to HTML C implementation.</p>
<p>Come on Discord and join the fun.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><p>Posted on March 12, 2025</p><p>AI for coding is in a weird spot right now.</p><p>You get people claiming that you can build a complete SaaS in 3 days, and others saying that it's worse than useless. Both of these people are probably just exaggerating or straight up lying.</p><p>I love coding with Cursor, it's completely changed the way I code, but it's also complete garbage a good deal of the time.</p><p>So as an AI skeptic i'll tell you everything I know to make your experience as good as possible.</p><p><em>Note: If you prefer watching rather than reading,<!-- --> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VC2b7wMfalI" target="_blank">here's a YouTube video</a> <!-- -->with the same content.</em></p><p>Let's start with an easy one.</p><p>If you don't have a<!-- --> <span>.cursorrules</span> file you are missing out.</p><p>(This has changed recently to be a bunch of<!-- --> <span>.mdc</span> files, just CMD+Shift+P<!-- --> <span>New Cursor Rule</span> and it will create one for you in the right place)</p><p>You can have one ready to go in about 10 minutes, and it will save you hours of time.</p><p>Look up your stack on this<!-- --> <a href="https://github.com/PatrickJS/awesome-cursorrules?tab=readme-ov-file#contents" target="_blank">list of cursorrules</a> <!-- -->and pull out the best bits.</p><p>But my advice is to keep it reasonably minimal and then build on it over time.</p><p>You don't need this massive file with every single programming best practice outlined.</p><p>The reason for shitty AI output is not because it forgot about DRY or SOLID. And I find that giving it too much input, and having longer chats, is when it starts to fall apart a bit. So keep it light.</p><p>And here's the thing: if you notice the same issues popping up again and again, just add a quick line telling it not to. Or even better, in your cursor chat just say "please write me a cursorrule so that you stop doing this particular thing." And then chuck it in there.</p><p>Like mine will keep forgetting about nullish coallescing (??) in JS, and even after I fix it up it will revert my change in its future changes. So of course I put that rule in and it won't happen again.</p><p>And then at the top of the file, just write some text about what the project is about. If you have a particular file structure and way of organising code that is great to put in as well.</p><p>I have found <em>by far</em> the best thing for improving the output is telling it exactly where to find the code it might otherwise spit out at you.</p><p>Like if you know it's going to need a certain function, or create a procedure very similar to something that exists, give it that context.</p><p>And you don't necessarily need to tell it the exact function - we're trying to make our lives easier here, of course I still want this to be easier than just writing the code myself.</p><p>After I tell it what I want I often just do a<!-- --> <span>see @schedule.ts @utils.ts @ScheduleHeader.tsx</span> <!-- -->and just include anything that will help it do its task - even in a more abstract "here's how something vaguely similar has been done" kind of way. The AI has been trained on a bunch of random code, so if there's anything particular to your project, then you need to tell it.</p><p>Okay and let's get into some rapid fire tips.</p><ul><li>I like Composer (now called Agent) for simple, low impact changes. And Chat (Ask) for everything else. Just the step of manually having to click apply and taking that extra second to think about the changes it's making, and in which files it's happening, rather than just be presented with a wave of green changes ready to get smashed in.</li><li>Don't blindly accept code. It's always gonna come back to bite you.</li><li>Every so often make sure you read and fully understand the most integral parts of your code, and refactor it <em>manually.</em> <!-- -->You will find a lot of gaps, and fixing it up means future AI-written code will be better.</li><li>Ask "is this the best way to do this?" or "have you considered xyz".</li><li>Learn when a problem is best solved manually.</li><li>Take extra care when using AI to fix bugs. I think it's particularly weak at fixing anything but the silliest of bugs. And it can cause a lot of damage in the process.</li><li>If it's a big and important task or you are setting the foundations for a feature, ask it to ask you any questions before writing code to make sure it has a full understanding of what you are trying to do.</li></ul><p>One of the best things about AI is that you can now write code when your brain is fried, and tackling a problem would normally be outside of your reach.</p><p>It's great for sitting on the couch and cranking out some mostly decent code, but then other days of course you just spend an hour chasing "You're right" "I see the issue now" only to end up in a worse place than you started.</p><p>But I would recommend experimenting with it and learning how best to talk to it. It's not going away, and it's just another tool that you can use.</p><p>And if you're a junior developer I would of course be very wary with it. And anyone for that matter really. I do think there's something to be said for the atrophying of my coding skills.</p><p>I also think one of the biggest factors in your experience with coding with AI is going to be <em>what</em> you are coding, and which tech stack you are using. So if it just keeps sucking no matter what you try, and you feel like you're going crazy seeing everyone hype it up, it's probably not your fault.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
           <p>Binary Security found the undocumented APIs for Azure API Connections. In this post we examine the inner workings of the Connections allowing us to escalate privileges and read secrets in backend resources for services ranging from Key Vaults, Storage Blobs, Defender ATP, to Enterprise Jira and SalesForce servers.
</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>During a client engagement, I was checking out their Azure Resources looking for common vulnerabilities. They were utilizing a Logic App to post some messages to Slack. Usually, we can find some tokens or other sensitive information in the workflow run history of these apps, as it is common to not mark input (and output) as sensitive. I could not find anything of the sort in this case, so I moved on from the investigation. However, by chance I saw an odd response from a request automatically made from the portal when going into the API Connection resource. It was something like:</p>

<p>Now, this might seem uninteresting at first glance, but there are two key fields in this response that really opened up a whole slew of possibilities.</p>
<h2 id="the-inherent-insecurity-of-api-connections">The Inherent Insecurity of API Connections</h2>
<p>Consider the <code>testLinks</code> and <code>testRequests</code> fields of the above response. It seems that they provide a sort of proxy between the Azure Management API and the actual backend server, most clearly seen by the <code>extensions/proxy</code> path. We can also see that the connection perhaps is authenticated in some way, by the <code>OAuth</code> value in the <code>parameterValueSet</code>. Now, naively, I would think that this means that some user, probably whoever set this up, is authenticated to this connection, and we would need his token to call through the connection, or maybe do an <code>OAuth</code> dance ourselves.</p>
<p>What I would <strong>not</strong> expect is that anyone with Reader permissions on the connection is allowed to arbitrarily call any endpoint on the connection:</p>

<p>The response is actually exactly the same as a direct query on the Slack API endpoint <a href="https://api.slack.com/methods/conversations.list">conversations.list</a></p>
<p>While the Slack case is perhaps not the most security critical, this result begs the question: Does this work for all the other types of APIs exposed through this interface?</p>
<p>The answer is yes. If you have created an API Connection to any backend server, this includes other Azure resources, all Readers on that subscription can call all <code>GET</code> requests defined on the connection. Specifically, this includes Key Vaults, SQL Databases, Jira-servers, Defender ATP, etc.</p>
<h2 id="azure-management-arm-apis-security-model">Azure Management (ARM) API’s Security Model</h2>
<p>Before I show how to exploit this properly, some background on the Azure Management API is required. While we cannot know for sure how the developers at Microsoft designed the system, it seems clear to me that initially, the security model of the management API considered that Readers should be allowed to perform <code>GET</code> requests. You would have to be <code>Contributor</code> or higher to perform any changes, i.e. using any of the <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>, <code>DELETE</code>, etc methods.</p>
<p>This can be seen by for instance requiring a number of sensitive endpoints for <code>App Services</code> to be empty <code>POST</code> requests, like <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/appservice/web-apps/list-host-keys">List Host Keys</a>.</p>
<p>At Binary Security we have reported a number of vulnerabilities relating to the leaking of sensitive information through insecure <code>GET</code> endpoints. The result of this is that the security model has been somewhat changed in recent times, and it is now not obvious if a Reader is allowed to call a <code>GET</code> endpoint. This is, however, still a viable attack method, and reading the documentation is still a goldmine for exploitable bugs.</p>
<p>Getting back to the API Connections, it should be clear that the Management’s <code>/extensions/proxy/{action}</code> endpoints will allow all Readers to call the defined <code>GET</code> requests. And while this is not seen as a problem in the ARM world, there is of course no guarantee that the connected API adheres to this security model.</p>
<h2 id="creating-an-api-connection">Creating an API Connection</h2>
<p>API Connections are resources in the Azure world, just like Key Vaults, SQL Databases or VMs, but they are not required to be explicitly created. They are automatically created for you when setting up Actions in a Logic App, so even if you have never heard of them before, it is quite possible that there are a lot of them hanging out in your tenant. For instance, creating a connection to your Key Vault is as easy as going to the Logic App Designer view, finding the Key Vaults actions, setting some initial values and authenticating.
<img src="https://binarysecurity.no/assets/images/posts/createkeyvault-connection.png" alt="Sign in to create the connection"></p>
<p>This of course requires that the person setting it up, and authenticating to the Key Vault has appropriate access to the Key Vault. After signing in, it is not required to even save the Workflow, the resource is still created, and will need to be explicitly deleted if it is not needed any more.</p>
<p>The flows for internal Azure Resources are all similar, where you can choose between different authentication types. For external resources, the setup varies, but in all cases, some authentication information is saved within the API Connection in some way, and this is used when querying the API.</p>
<p>This means that the authentication used on the backend API call is always the same, and does not depend on the user or principal calling the ARM API. Crucially, the backend cannot know whether the call comes from the Logic App or from the proxy endpoint, called by any Reader on the resource.</p>
<h2 id="the-api-connection-api">The API Connection API</h2>
<p>The full list of API Connections (Connectors) can be seen <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/connector-reference/">here</a>. The proxy endpoints are not explicitly listed, but they can either be deduced from the API of the connected service, or by querying the <code>managedAPIs</code> endpoint for that specific Connector, which exposes a Swagger definition of the API. Here we query it for the definition of the Jira Connector:</p>

                },

<p>The <code>{connectionId}</code> in this case is the full path to the <code>proxy</code> endpoint, something like <code>/subscription/[SUBSCRIPTION_ID]/resourceGroups/[RESOURCE_GROUP]/providers/Microsoft.Web/connections/[CONNECTION_NAME]/extensions/proxy/</code>.</p>
<p>Armed with this knowledge, we can go searching for sensitive endpoints.</p>
<h3 id="azure-key-vaults">Azure Key Vaults</h3>
<p>The Connector for Key Vaults is maybe the one with the highest impact. The Swagger definition includes these sensitive <code>GET</code> endpoints</p>
<ul>
 <li><code>/{connectionId}/secrets</code> for listing secrets</li>
 <li><code>/{connectionId}/secrets/{secretName}/value</code> to retrieve the value of the secret</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://binarysecurity.no/assets/images/posts/keyvault_value.png" alt="Leaking Secrets through the connection"></p>
<h3 id="sql-databases">SQL Databases</h3>
<p>The SQL Connector is quite similar to the Key Vault, you are basically free to read whatever you want:</p>
<ul>
 <li>
   <p><code>/{connectionId}/databases</code> -  List Databases</p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p><code>/{connectionId}/datasets</code> - List Datasets</p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p><code>/{connectionId}/datasets({dataset})/tables({table})/items</code> - Get rows from a table</p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://binarysecurity.no/assets/images/posts/get-data-from-sql.png" alt="Reading the rows of the database"></p>
<p>There is also a hilarious error message here, when trying to do some path traversing in the dataset name. It did not seem to be exploitable in any way, but I bet you have never seen a stacktrace exposed in an HTTP status message:</p>
<p><img src="https://binarysecurity.no/assets/images/posts/api-connectors-sql-error-in-status-line.png" alt="Path traversal leads to stacktrace in HTTP status message"></p>
<h2 id="jira">Jira</h2>
<p>The Jira Connector also exposes effectively everything on your Jira instance:</p>
<ul>
 <li>
   <p><code>/{connectionId}/v2/project/search</code> - List projects</p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p><code>/{connectionId}/user/permission/search</code> - List users</p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p><code>/{connectionId}/2/search</code> - List issues</p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <p><code>/{connectionId}/issue/{issueKey}</code> - Read an issue</p>
 </li>
</ul>
<p>This connector is also interesting because it, of course, must be connected to your Jira instance somewhere else on the Internet. When setting up the connection, the developer gives the connection the URL of the Jira Instance. Incredibly, this is ignored in all subsequent requests, and instead, a special <code>X-Request-Jirainstance</code> header must be included in the request. This should point to your Jira instance, but there is no verification, so an attacker is free to SSRF at will. By setting this to an attacker-controlled server, the attacker will receive the API token used by the connection. This effectively also bypasses the restriction on the requests, and allows the attacker to query any endpoint with any method.</p>
<p><img src="https://binarysecurity.no/assets/images/posts/send-request-to-collaborator.png" alt="The special header will force the server to make a request to an attacker-controlled site"></p>
<p><img src="https://binarysecurity.no/assets/images/posts/collaborator-receives-token.png" alt="The attacker receives the request, with the token in the `Authorization` header"></p>
<p>Note that this attack is only possible when using the <code>APIToken</code> authentication mechanism. When using <code>OAuth</code>, a GUID is used to identify your Jira Instance.</p>
<h2 id="the-rest">The Rest</h2>
<p>All API Connections must be considered insecure as long as Readers can call the backend server. In nearly all cases I have seen, the connection exposes all information on the backend service. In addition to the ones above, this includes:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Salesforce</li>
 <li>Azure Storage Blobs</li>
 <li>Azure Defender ATP</li>
 <li>Google Mail, Contacts, Calendars</li>
</ul>
<p>and probably much more.</p>
<h2 id="future-work">Future work</h2>
<p>I think there is significant undiscovered potential in these connections. Without going into detail, I can tell you that API Connections have a significant amount of architecture hidden between the Management Server and the backend API. All calls go from ARM to a <em>global</em> APIM instance containing every tenant’s API Connection, utilizing a <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-tokens">Token Store</a>. The initial authentication setup likewise goes through a <em>global</em> Consent server for storing tokens. If this hidden infrastructure is compromised, there will be significant cross-tenant impact as well.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Hopefully by now, you have realized the impact of a lacking security model. While these endpoints are undocumented, that only makes them harder to find, not exploit. I am confident that any security researcher who had found them would immediately have noticed the glaring security hole it puts in their tenant. Hopefully, this post will allow others to discover more insecurities in Azure, so that we can be more secure in the future.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			
<p>Towards the end of last year, we learned that a group (allegedly affiliated with the Chinese government, referred to as “Salt Typhoon”) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241127172349/https://www.t-mobile.com/news/un-carrier/update-cyberattacks-targeting-us-wireless-companies">breached T-Mobile and other telecommunications companies</a> and caused all sorts of havoc.</p>



<p>This isn’t really a blog post about that incident, but it was the catalyst that inspired a bit of curiosity within me.</p>



<p>I can’t (legally) access most mobile phone companies’ networks to see what vulnerabilities I can find, but there are plenty of open source software projects related to telecommunications on GitHub. So when I heard about the Salt Typhoon hacks, I wondered, “Is any of this open source telecom software any good?”</p>



<p>In a previous life, I worked with companies that used <a href="https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Asterisk</a> and <a href="https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FreeSWITCH</a>, but I’d never really looked into them beyond the surface-level familiarity congruent to “this uses a similar protocol as RedPhone, somewhere” (this was when <a href="https://soatok.blog/2025/02/18/reviewing-the-cryptography-used-by-signal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Signal</a> was still called TextSecure).</p>



<p>I don’t know much about PBX systems, SIP, or even audio encoding. Furthermore, some of the best C programmers I’ve ever met worked in telecom. Hell, some of the longest-running hacker communities have their roots in phone phreaking from the 1980s. Not to mention all the legendary engineers that trace their roots to Bell Labs.</p>



<p>This is all to say, I thought looking at this sort of software would be a fruitless endeavor. </p>



<p><em>Surely all of the low-hanging fruit would be found already?</em></p>



<p>Thus, I opened FreeSWITCH’s source code on GitHub and almost immediately found a vulnerability.</p>





<h2>Buffer Overflow in HTTP Request Handler for XMLRPC</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/blob/75566bc270f7b4064eb9ff3aed68e2f752fc17ee/libs/xmlrpc-c/lib/abyss/src/handler.c#L243-L250">this excerpt of code</a>, the HTTP request handler for the XMLRPC library bundled with FreeSWITCH writes an arbitrary-length URI to a 4096-byte stack variable called z.</p>


<div><pre title="">char z[4096];
char *p,z1[26],z2[20],z3[9],u;
const char * z4;
int16_t i;
uint32_t k;

if (text) {
    sprintf(z, "Index of %s" CRLF, uri);
</pre></div>


<p>The <code>uri</code> variable <a href="https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/blob/75566bc270f7b4064eb9ff3aed68e2f752fc17ee/libs/xmlrpc-c/include/xmlrpc-c/abyss.h#L366-L370">is populated by the path part of the Request URI</a>, which is attacker-provided.</p>



<p>This is not typically a problem, since <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/417184" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most browsers don’t support URLs longer than 2048 characters</a>, but the relevant RFCs support up to about 8 KB in most cases. (CloudFlare supports up to 32KB.)</p>



<p>I think it’s reasonable to assume that attackers are capable of sending a Request URI longer than 4096 characters.</p>



<p>Putting these observations together, it’s pretty easy to see this is a no-auth buffer overflow in their XMLRPC library. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>Turning this into remote code execution is an exercise left to the reader (mostly because I’m not really up-to-date on OS-level exploit mitigation techniques, and how to bypass them).</p>

<p>Since the fixes are now public, I’m left to assume that “embargo has broken,” so to speak. That means I’m free to blog about this publicly.</p>



<p>However, I notice they haven’t tagged a new release with this security fix for FreeSWITCH users. I reply:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Oh, wonderful. Thanks for getting back to me.</p>



<p>Do you have an ETA on when the release will be tagged? I don’t want to publish anything until people can easily install an updated version.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A few hours later, Andrey responds to my email.</p>



<p>Brace yourselves, it’s a stupid one.</p>



<p>…</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Hello Soatok.</p>



<p>Thank you for your interest in FreeSWITCH.</p>



<p>We do not have plans to make a release&nbsp;of FreeSWITCH Community till summer 2025.</p>



<p>Best regards,</p>
</blockquote>





<h3>What Just Happened?</h3>



<p>To recap: An employee of SignalWire (which develops FreeSWITCH) came right out and said they would let people who aren’t <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250226171744/https://signalwire.com/products/freeswitch-enterprise">paying for FreeSWITCH Advantage</a> stay vulnerable until their regularly scheduled release (sometime in the Summer).</p>



<p>There are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250312042655/https://www.shodan.io/search?query=freeswitch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about 8,300 hits on Shodan for FreeSWITCH</a> as I write this. I highly doubt they’re all paying for enterprise support, so we’re talking about potentially thousands of telecom stacks around the world that SignalWire has decided to keep vulnerable until the Summer, even after they published the patches on GitHub.</p>



<p>While such a decision might be perfectly legal, it really does not inspire trust in the stewards of this software project to give a shit about the harm their careless coding practices inflict upon their users.</p>



<h2>TelecomSec: A Systemic Issue</h2>



<p>The worst part is, when I confided in a friend that works in telecom (after SignalWire published the fixes, of course) about this carnival-quality vulnerability management from the FreeSWITCH developers, their response was:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>That fast?</p>



<p>[…]</p>



<p>December 2024 is the last time that alarms were once again raised about known SS7 vulnerabilities that have continued to exist in telephone networks for the past 17 years.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And, to be honest, that <em>kind of took the wind out of my sails</em> so I didn’t bother looking at Asterisk or any of the other software.</p>



<p>I mean, why bother? I already had the answer to the question that prompted me to look in the first place: <strong>Telecom security sucks today</strong>.</p>



<p>The reason things sucks is largely because there’s very little (if any) money to be made in securing these systems today.</p>



<p>Things don’t <em>have to</em> be this way, of course.</p>



<p>Maybe there’s some opportunity for some enterprising young hacker to write a FreeSWITCH competitor in Rust that has sane vulnerability management around it.</p>



<p>(Or, at least, is marginally harder to find vulnerabilities in than <a href="https://github.com/digininja/DVWA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Damn Vulnerable Web Application</a>. Maybe the OpenBSD team can be inspired to act?)</p>



<p>Maybe in the future, we’ll find the political will to invest in the security of America’s telecommunications infrastructure. Who knows, some of that money might even percolate towards open source software, and they can hire someone who knows how to run valgrind.</p>



<p>Or maybe everything will continue to suck, because incentives rule anything, and there currently aren’t any to do better.</p>





<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>



<p>It took me a long time to write this one up, despite it being a rather simple technical issue, because I’m sure there are eldritch horrors lurking beneath the surface of this relatively simple finding.</p>



<p>The vendor’s response was pretty lame, yeah. But is this vendor the lamest in their industry? I’m not so sure about that one. At least they responded within 90 days and fixed the issue on their GitHub.</p>



<p>But, hey, if you’re waiting on SignalWire to get around to running <code>git tag</code>… maybe rebuild from source or block public HTTP access to your FreeSWITCH stack at the firewall level?</p>



<p>Sorry I can’t help more.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><header><p><span>Authors</span><span>Jiaming Song</span><span>Linqi Zhou</span></p><p>March 11, 2025</p></header><div><p><span>Generated samples on ImageNet-256×256 using 8 steps.</span></p></div></div><div><h3>Fully unlocking the potential of rich multi-modal data</h3><div><p>There is a growing sentiment in the AI community that generative pre-training is reaching a limit. However, we argue that these limits are not due to a lack of data itself, but rather a stagnation in algorithmic innovation. The field remains dominated by just two paradigms since around mid-2020: autoregressive models for discrete signals and diffusion models for continuous signals. This stagnation has created a bottleneck that prevents us from fully unlocking the potential of rich multi-modal data, which in turn limits the progress on multimodal intelligence.</p><p>At Luma, we aim to overcome this algorithmic ceiling through the lens of efficient inference-time compute scaling. Today we are introducing a new method, Inductive Moment Matching (IMM), a pre-training technique that not only delivers superior sample quality compared to diffusion models but also offers over a tenfold increase in sampling efficiency. In contrast to consistency models (CMs), which are unstable as a pre-training technique and require special hyperparameter designs, IMM employs a single objective with enhanced stability across diverse settings.</p></div><div><p><span>Sample quality during training for IMM vs. CM. CM is highly unstable and collapses easily.</span></p></div><div><p>To facilitate future research, we release the code and checkpoints (<a href="https://github.com/lumalabs/imm" target="_blank">https://github.com/lumalabs/imm</a>), a technical paper over the details of the IMM (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07565" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07565</a>), and a position paper on how to advance generative pre-training algorithms from an efficient inference-time scaling perspective (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07154" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07154</a>).</p></div><h3>How Inductive Moment Matching Works</h3><p>Inference can generally be scaled along two dimensions: extending sequence length (in autoregressive models), and augmenting the number of refinement steps (in diffusion models). While adding more refinement steps significantly boosts diffusion models, simply increasing the model capacity does not yield proportional improvements. This is because diffusion models inherently require more granular steps to converge to an optimal solution, regardless of the networks’ representational power. This shows that, from an inference-time perspective, diffusion models are not optimal in utilizing the networks’ capacity.</p><div><p><span>Diffusion models' performance grows slowly with number of steps, regardless of its model size. In contrast, IMM scales much more efficiently.</span></p></div><p>We illustrate these limitations from an inference perspective by examining the DDIM sampler for diffusion models. In each DDIM iteration, the network first generates a prediction using the current input and timestep, then linearly interpolates this prediction toward that of the next timestep. This constrains the expressive capacity of each iteration as it is linear with respect to the next timestep, ultimately capping performance regardless of the training method employed (see figure below).</p><div><div><p><span>The original DDIM sampler using the diffusion model network is not flexible over the target timestep during inference.</span></p></div><div><p><span>Adding the target timestep allows the sampler to be flexible enough for few step generation.</span></p></div></div><p>We design our new pre-training algorithm by first aiming to mitigate this inference limitation. Our new method, Inductive Moment Matching (IMM), introduces a subtle yet powerful modification: alongside the current timestep, the network also processes the target timestep to jump towards. This change enhances the flexibility of each inference iteration, paving the way for state-of-the-art performance and efficiency. We realize this improvement by incorporating maximum mean discrepancy — a robust moment matching technique that was developed more than 15 years ago.</p><h3>Scaling and Stability</h3><p>We test IMM on various hyperparameters and model architectures. On ImageNet 256x256, IMM achieves 1.99 Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and surpasses diffusion models (2.27 FID) and Flow Matching (2.15 FID) with 30x fewer sampling steps. It similarly achieves state-of-the-art 2-step FID of 1.98 on the standard CIFAR-10 dataset for a model trained from scratch.</p><div><p><img alt="Sample quality versus sampling compute.

Conversely, </span><em>Cocomelon</em><span> — which started on YouTube — is algorithmic slop that has been called “crack for kids” and is probably as educational as taping strobe lights to your child’s eyeballs. </span></p><p>Let me explain.</p><p>***</p><p><em>Bluey </em><span>debuted in 2018 and has cranked out 152 episodes — about 7 minutes each — across three seasons. The 153rd episode is scheduled for April 14 and many believe that it will be the end of the show in its current form (more on this later).</span></p><p><span>The show was created by Joe Brumm, an Australian who started his professional career in the UK's TV animation industry. Before returning to Australia in 2009, Brumm worked on successful children’s shows including </span><em>Charlie &amp; Lola </em><span>and</span><em> Peppa Pig</em><span> (</span><em>Peppa’s</em><span> production company Entertainment One sold the brand to Hasbro for a whopping $4B in 2019).</span></p><p><span>In 2015, Brumm teamed up with Brisbane-based Ludo Studios to shop a 1-minute teaser of </span><em>Bluey</em><span>. This short version of the show failed to find a buyer because the target audience wasn’t clear. Was it meant for adults or children? The confusion stemmed from the fact that Brumm had originally planned to create an R-rated version of </span><em>Peppa Pig</em><span>.</span></p><p>Ultimately, Brumm decided to make a show for preschoolers. He pulled material from his own life as a father of two girls under the age of 10. </p><p><span>With the kid focus, Ludo convinced the country’s national broadcaster (Australian Broadcasting Corporation aka ABC) to give Brumm $13k for a single 5-minute episode. ABC saw the potential and greenlit $5m+ for a first season. Unable to foot the whole bill, ABC partnered with BBC Studios, the business arm of the UK’s national broadcaster. BBC negotiated the global distribution, licensing and merchandising rights for </span><em>Bluey</em><span> (in other words, ABC is barely profiting from one of  the country’s largest cultural exports since Mad Max, AC/DC, Kylie Minogue,  Crocodile Dundee or Men at Work). </span></p><p><span>How did </span><em>Bluey</em><span> become such a hit? </span></p><p><span>It has great animation with funny and emotional writing that parents want to watch with their kids. I mentioned hungover parenting as one theme but </span><em>Bluey</em><span> has ably dealt with many grown-up topics including infertility, mental health and death.</span></p><p><span>In an interview with </span><em>The Hollywood Reporter, </em><span>Brumm </span><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/bluey-creator-disney-notes-peppa-ping-inspiration-1235508845/" rel="">said</a><span> he chose this approach because he noticed a gap in the market. He wanted “a good co-viewing show where the parents could genuinely watch it with the kids” and there weren’t many options for the “the preschool stage”. </span></p><p>The co-viewing magic happens because the show’s parents (Bandi, Chilli) are just as integral to the storyline as the kids (Bluey, Bingo). Preschoolers love inventing games and making their parents play with them. It is their way of learning how the world works.</p><p><em>Bluey </em><span>is a mix of games that every parent knows (</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDrqgBb1dC4" rel="">“driving a bus”</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHIKWpZrULE" rel="">“keepy uppy with a balloon”</a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqOJC8VobE" rel="">“cardboard box forts”</a><span>) as well as games that Brumm has pulled from his own life (</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DklpM_lZIOU" rel="">“Magic Xylophone”</a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqExJdPYu00" rel="">“The Magic Claw”</a><span>). </span></p><p><span>How does Brumm come up with these ideas? In the most parenting way possible as he explained on the </span><em><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/mk/podcast/how-joe-brumm-dads/id1650126940?i=1000625580746" rel="">How Other Dads Dad</a></em><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/mk/podcast/how-joe-brumm-dads/id1650126940?i=1000625580746" rel=""> podcast</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>[The games on Bluey are] just games that evolved at 5 in the morning [while taking care of the kids]. And “evolve” is a good word because some games you play once and they're a bit boring and they just fall away. </em></p><p><em>Others you find, “Hey, can we play that game again?” </em></p><p><em>And you're like, “Yeah, all right and let's add this.”  </em></p><p><em>Two months later  [that game has] got a name.</em></p></blockquote><p>The uniqueness of each game comes through particularly well because Brumm has written nearly every episode on his own. The solo process was a deliberate choice because — coming from a TV background — Brumm knew that a team of TV writers would likely lead to a formulaic product.</p><p>There is no magic to the writing, either.</p><p><span>In a relatable passage for any writer, Brumm tells the </span><em><a href="https://www.blueypod.com/e/joe-brumm-aka-the-interview/" rel="">Gotta Be Done</a></em><a href="https://www.blueypod.com/e/joe-brumm-aka-the-interview/" rel=""> podcast</a><span> how he gets an idea on paper and then edits and edits: </span></p><blockquote><p><em>I think the first thing I've realized is…just write [the first draft quickly] and don't show anyone because it is terrible. […] Know that it is going to suck and it is going to be all over the place. </em></p><p><em>But then it's there. Then I print it out. Then I go lie on a couch and it looks like I'm loafing, but then it's just scribbling. Let's move this here…cut it up and rearrange it on the table. </em></p><p><em>You've just got to write that first draft.</em></p></blockquote><p><em>Bluey’s </em><span>distinctiveness</span><em> </em><span>also comes from the voice actors, who are actual children from Brisbane. When the show was being shopped internationally, many buyers — including Disney — wanted to re-record the voices. However, Brumm fought to keep the Aussie accents and this decision definitely helps the show stand out.</span></p><p><span>I'll add one more Aussie-related fun fact. The "Heeler" family is named after the Blue Heeler dogs, herding dogs specially bred in Australia in the mid-1800s to shepherd cattle over long distances (also known as "cattle dogs"). In a nice symmetry to how </span><em>Bluey </em><span>is making waves internationally, these dogs were once a major export for the country. The show’s popularity has led to some people buying Blue Heelers as a pet for their kids…which will probably backfire because they aren’t meant to be house dogs (Blue Heelers need an insane amount of exercise and can be pretty aggressive). </span></p><p><span>“[Making </span><em>Bluey </em><span>is</span><em>]</em><span> a craft thing,” Brumm said in the </span><em>The Hollywood Reporter </em><span>interview</span><em>. “</em><span>We really tried to get it to look beautiful and to sound beautiful. It should have its own score and its own visual style and really not just [be about] trying to knock it out for cheap.”</span></p><p>Add it all up and Brumm is telling a story that is uniquely his own.</p><p>***</p><p><span>Some quick background on </span><em>Cocomelon</em><span>.</span></p><p>It started in 2006 as a children’s education YouTube channel called That’sMeOnTv.com. </p><p>Korean-American Jay Jeon and his wife created the channel with animated alphabet songs to teach children how to read. The channel rebranded twice before becoming Cocomelon in 2018. By this time, Jeon and a team of animators in California were creating 3D-animated videos of kids doing kids things while singing public domain nursery rhymes.</p><p><span>As more parents turned to YouTube to entertain their children, Cocomelon rocketed up the charts. It is currently the 3rd most popular channel on YouTube (with 174 million subscribers) and it does insane numbers. The channel has eight </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CoComelon/videos" rel="">videos</a><span> with over 2 billion views including “Bath Song”, “Wheels on the Bus”, “Baa Baa Black Sheep” and “Old MacDonald” (yes, I’ve heard all of these many many times). </span></p><p>By 2019, Jeon was making over $100 million a year in ad revenue. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F775a54a5-6bd0-4131-a9f3-bccc2ff31df5_1201x518.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F775a54a5-6bd0-4131-a9f3-bccc2ff31df5_1201x518.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F775a54a5-6bd0-4131-a9f3-bccc2ff31df5_1201x518.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F775a54a5-6bd0-4131-a9f3-bccc2ff31df5_1201x518.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F775a54a5-6bd0-4131-a9f3-bccc2ff31df5_1201x518.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F775a54a5-6bd0-4131-a9f3-bccc2ff31df5_1201x518.png" width="1201" height="518" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/775a54a5-6bd0-4131-a9f3-bccc2ff31df5_1201x518.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:518,&quot;width&quot;:1201,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:835266,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F775a54a5-6bd0-4131-a9f3-bccc2ff31df5_1201x518.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F775a54a5-6bd0-4131-a9f3-bccc2ff31df5_1201x518.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F775a54a5-6bd0-4131-a9f3-bccc2ff31df5_1201x518.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F775a54a5-6bd0-4131-a9f3-bccc2ff31df5_1201x518.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><em>Cocomelon</em><span> cracked the YouTube algorithm the same way slot machines cracked gambling or TikTok cracked social video.

He is basing his work on real-life social play and his "5am" interactions with his children. For each idea, he navigates a writing maze and incorporates adult themes to develop the ideal 7-minute co-viewing experience. </p><p>It is craftsmanship. </p><p><span>Contrast everything I just wrote with </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/05/arts/television/cocomelon-moonbug-entertainment.html" rel="">Moonbug’s “audience research day”</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>Once a month, children are brought to [a London studio], one at a time, and shown a handful of episodes to figure out exactly which parts of the shows are engaging and which are tuned out.</em></p><p><em>For anyone older than 2 years old, the team deploys a whimsically named tool: the Distractatron.</em></p><p><em>It’s a small TV screen, placed a few feet from the larger one, that plays a continuous loop of banal, real-world scenes — a guy pouring a cup of coffee, someone getting a haircut — each lasting about 20 seconds. Whenever a youngster looks away from the Moonbug show to glimpse the Distractatron, a note is jotted down.</em></p><p><em>“It’s not mega-interesting, what’s on the Distractatron,” said Maurice Wheeler, who runs the research group. “But if they aren’t fully focused, they might go, ‘Oh, what’s that?’ and kind of drift over. We can see what they’re looking at and the exact moment when they got distracted.”</em></p></blockquote><p>I repeat: a “Distractatron”. </p><p><span>Brumm recently launched the </span><em><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/behind-bluey" rel="">Behind Bluey</a></em><span> podcast. In it, Brumm talks to various team members (animators, voice actors etc.) about creating the show. I haven’t listened to all of the episodes yet but I’m guessing…THEY DON’T USE A F—ING DISTRACTATRON!!!</span></p><p><span>Here is more from the </span><em>NYT</em><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>Outside this office, some 270 employees are working on Moonbug shows in the company’s headquarters, a sleek, open-plan space on one floor of a four-story building beside a canal in Camden Town, a district in northwest London. Pre- and post- production are handled here and in the United States, where the company has another 120 staffers, mostly in Los Angeles. The company works with animators around the world.</em></p><p><em>Those hands are nothing if not data driven. [Moonbug Entertainment CEO] René Rechtman has a background in private equity and is more of an algorithm guy than an artist. Shows at Moonbug are honed in ways that leave little to chance, and audience research commences long before any episode gets near the Distractatron.</em></p><p><em>A data and analytics team sifts constantly through YouTube numbers to determine exactly what resonates. Should a girl wear black jeans or blue jeans? Should the music be louder or softer? Should the bus be yellow or red?</em></p><p><em>Yellow, is the answer.</em></p><p><em>“Kids love yellow buses around the world,” said David Levine, the chief content officer at Moonbug. “In some countries, yellow buses are actually used to transport prisoners. But still, kids around the world love to see yellow buses and kids on yellow buses.”</em></p><p><em>Infants are also enamored with objects covered in a little dirt, like they’ve been rolling around on the ground. And they’re fascinated by minor injuries. Not broken legs or gruesome wounds. More like small cuts that require Band-Aids.</em></p><p><em>“The trifecta for a kid would be a dirty yellow bus that has a boo-boo,” Levine said. “Broken fender, broken wheel, little grimace on its face.”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Moonbug has </span><em>Cocomelon</em><span> down to a science. It is an assembly line — a very lucrative assembly line — that is feeding YouTube’s algorithm and Netflix’s kid show tab. </span></p><p><em>Bluey</em><span> has a creative process. </span></p><p><em>Cocomelon</em><span> is processed. </span></p><p>***</p><p><span>Listen, I know I’m going pretty hard on </span><em>Cocomelon</em><span>.</span></p><p>Parenting is difficult. </p><p>I get it. </p><p><em>Cocomelon</em><span> is a digital babysitter for time-strapped caregivers. I won’t pretend like I haven’t stuck an iPad in front of my son and let him watch </span><em>Cocomelon</em><span> or </span><em>Blippi</em><span> so I could get some work done. Guilty as charged. </span></p><p><span>The show has more educational content compared to other popular YouTube kids genres including toy unboxings, Hot Wheels on ramps or </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/culture/2017/11/21/16685874/kids-youtube-video-elsagate-creepiness-psychology" rel="">that time the algo was recomnending creepy videos with headless comic-book characters</a><span>. </span></p><p><span>It is more than just “taping strobe lights to your child’s eyeballs”. But</span><strong> </strong><span>there are just better options than </span><em>Cocomelon</em><span> for YouTube and streaming imo (including </span><em>Bluey</em><span>, of course).</span></p><p><span>The Moonbug team did raise a larger point in the </span><em>NYT</em><span> article: </span><em>Cocomelon </em><span>is not meant to be a substitute for normal play. “It just</span><em> </em><span>should not replace the time you’re outside bicycling,” says Rechtman. “Or outside playing with your friends. That’s for sure.”</span></p><p><span>Same goes for </span><em>Bluey</em><span>. While it is a superior shared experience, watching the show with my son will never be better than biking with him at the park or playing his invented games (including ones from </span><em>Bluey</em><span> that he loves and adapts). </span></p><p><span>Let’s put the parenting aspect of these shows aside and talk about </span><em>Bluey </em><span>vs. </span><em>Cocomelon</em><span> as a view on art and media. </span></p><p><em>Cocomelon</em><span> is as formulaic as it gets. There are countless </span><em>Cocomelon </em><span>knock-offs on YouTube right now because it’s so easy to knock off. Take a nursery rhyme from the public domain. Slap on some colorful animation. Pack the YouTube video with the correct keywords. Maybe even pay for some algorithmic-boosting secret sauce. </span></p><p><span>Next thing you know, the top YouTube search result for “Wheels on the Bus” is a Cocomelon knock-off called </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnRK9giGyBE" rel="">Lalafun Nursery Rhymes</a><span>. </span></p><p>Every new iteration of AI will make it easier and easier to create a "Cocomelon" clone. </p><p>However, do you know what AI isn't capable of producing today or in the foreseeable future? A thoughtful 7-minute episode about hungover parenting that is equally enjoyable for parents and kids.</p><p><span>In the face of the upcoming AI-powered content deluge, I keep going back to this quote that music super-producer Rick Rubin mentioned on the Joe Rogan </span><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5oDyN0CFjEwClqjZxJQf9O" rel="">podcast</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>“Everything I do is just personal taste and it’s what the book is about. Really, for [people and artists] to trust in themselves. Make something that speaks to themselves. And hopefully someone else will like it. But you can’t second-guess your own taste for what someone else is going to like. It won’t be good. We’re not smart enough to know what someone else will like.</span><p><span>To make something and say, ‘well, I don’t really like it but I think this group of people will like it’, I think [that approach] is a bad way to play the game of music or art. Do what’s personal to you, take it as far you can go. Really push the boundaries and people will resonate with it if they are supposed to resonate with it. But you can’t get there the other way. The other way is a dead-end path.”</span></p></em></p></blockquote><p><span>That basically describes </span><em>Cocomelon</em><span> vs. </span><em>Bluey</em><span>.</span></p><p>The former works off of a formula for what the audience might like. The latter is an expression of a single person’s unique taste.</p><p><span>Brumm echoed a similar thought as Rubin when asked on the </span><em>Gotta Be Done</em><span> podcast if he chose characters and plot lines with a marketing lens: </span></p><blockquote><p><em>Look, I suppose the one thing I did not want to do was approach [Bluey] from a marketing point of view. […] My approach was, well, I'm just going to make something that's good and…that will be the marketing decision. Let's just make something that's good.</em><span> </span></p></blockquote><p><span>This is the approach that gave us “Sleepytime”, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DEBViLEoXc" rel="">which is about sleep training toddlers and is probably the episode of </a><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DEBViLEoXc" rel="">Bluey</a></em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DEBViLEoXc" rel=""> that parents love the most</a><span>. It transcends “children’s content” and embodies a Robin Williams quote from the film </span><em>Dead Poets Society </em><span>which Brumm cites as inspiration: </span></p><blockquote><p><em>“Medicine, law, business, engineering, these are all noble pursuits, and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for.”</em></p></blockquote><div id="youtube2-5DEBViLEoXc" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;5DEBViLEoXc&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5DEBViLEoXc?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p><span>I write all of this knowing that there is a finite amount of </span><em>Bluey</em><span>-caliber content.</span></p><p><em>Cocomelon </em><span>is McDonald’s and </span><em>Bluey </em><span>is a Michelin restaurant. There is a place in the market for both but McDonald’s has a much more repeatable model.</span></p><p><span>The challenge of keeping up the Michelin quality is a concern for </span><em>Bluey </em><span>with many fans worried that Brumm is leaving the show. The season 3 finale — which will air on April 14 — is unusually long (clocking in at 28 minutes) and is titled "The Sign" (leading theorists to believe it may refer to a moving sign for the Heeler family).</span></p><p>Why would Brumm leave? His daughters have gotten older (which means less material). Meanwhile, the voice actors — including some Brisbane-based children — are also getting older (which means their voices are changing).</p><p>The brand is so valuable and BBC/Ludo will find a way to milk it. There is already a live play and talk of a film.</p><p>But without Brumm, the TV show will lose its unique soul…like that part in the “Whale Watching” episode when Chilli asks Bandit to get some chips and sour cream dip to help her recover from the hangover. I’ve done that at least 100x for my wife and snickered when Chilli made the request. My son was none the wiser and that’s what made the co-viewing experience so great.</p><p><em><span>Today’s SatPost is brought to you by&nbsp;</span><a href="https://bearly.ai/" rel="">Bearly.AI</a></em><strong>Why are you seeing this ad?</strong></p><p>Because I co-founded an AI-powered research app and my technical partner is doing all the real work while I make dumb jokes and offer coupons.&nbsp;</p><p>We just added Claude Opus, a powerful new AI language model for querying, summarizing and editing large text documents (or help with your code, which I can't do but you might find helpful).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><span>Use code&nbsp;</span><strong>BEARLY1</strong><span>&nbsp;for a&nbsp;</span><a href="https://link.workweek.com/click/34624661.2043/aHR0cHM6Ly9iZWFybHkuYWkvP2hhc2hlZF91c2VyPTlkNjI1ODJkZjgzMDUwNGZjOGU2NWQyZWY0ZGNhMGE4/62b3df6ab05e1477650912a3B51bad66f" rel="">free month of the Bearly AI Pro Plan</a><span> and try Claude Opus.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://bearly.ai/&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Try Bearly AI for FREE&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://bearly.ai/" rel=""><span>Try Bearly AI for FREE</span></a></p><p><strong>Instagram’s revenue revealed: </strong><span>Zuck Daddy Flex acquired Instagram for $1B in 2012. Most tech media folks roasted him. How could he spend 9-figures on a 12-person team making little revenue? It was obviously a prescient move and often called the best tech deal ever along with Google acquiring YouTube for $1.7B in 2006.</span></p><p>Thanks to a recent court filing, we know IG's revenue figures and it's a beast: 2018 ($11.3B), 2019 ($17.9B), 2020 ($22.0B) and 2021 ($32.4B). IG now represents ~30% of Meta’s revenue (the main Facebook app is still huge but its growth has slowed a lot in recent years…we’d live in a different tech world without the deal).</p><p><span>Also of note: Tanay Jaipuria </span><a href="https://twitter.com/tanayj/status/1777055129688056135" rel="">writes</a><span> that Instagram makes more “in ad revenue than YouTube (and likely at much higher gross margins!)”…due to YouTube’s revenue share program, which pays out 55% of revenue to creators (including kid-friendly content that rhymes with “MocoCelon”).</span></p><p>***</p><p><strong>Airbnb’s Solar Eclipse business: </strong><span>I’ll be honest. I had no idea that the Total Solar Eclipse was happening until I saw some memes on X about it. This was bad planning because my son says he wants to see one but the next North American total eclipse isn’t until 2044. Other people definitely saw it, with the eclipse-related economic impact in the US estimated at $6B (that is Taylor Swift levels).</span></p><p><span>Within that spending, </span><em>The Economist</em><span> detailed the </span><a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2024/04/06/airbnb-bookings-for-the-solar-eclipse-reach-astronomical-levels" rel="">business of short-term home rentals</a><span>:</span></p><ul><li><p>The eclipse path in the US was 180km wide</p></li><li><p>There were 92,000 Airbnb and VRBO rentals in the path</p></li><li><p>92% occupancy on the Sunday night (vs. 30% for a normal April weekend)</p></li><li><p>Average booking was $269 (only 10% above the prior week)</p></li></ul><p>An interesting detail: most of the Airbnb rentals were booked two months in advance, which is why the customers locked in a good price. Major hotel/motel chains — much more business conscious — jacked up prices by 50% to 100%. </p><p>When you add up the higher occupancy and slight room rate bump, the solar eclipse was a cumulative revenue bump of $44m for Airbnb/VRBO. My napkin math says these homeowners left ~$10m on the table by not doing a hotel chain mark-up. Now I just need to wait 20 years to jump on this vacation deal.</p><p><span>PS.

<p>Fast forward to 2025, and we have a <a href="https://comma.ai/shop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">real product</a> that users love, built in our own factory, with great unit economics, and a real supply chain.

<p>As I write this, we’re finalizing construction plans to max out our office’s datacenter and manufacturing capacity next month.</p>
<p>I’m optimistic 2025 will be comma’s biggest year yet. We’ve had the second largest fleet after Tesla for a while now, and with a <a href="https://blog.comma.ai/autonomy/#world-model-as-a-simulator">training architecture able to take advantage of it</a>, we’re leveraging that fleet to massively scale up data ingestion, processing, and training compute.</p>

It follows the same pattern as the CPU implementation. It’s my first naive implementation on CUDA. The kernel is launched for each merge operation and recursion is done on CPU.</p> <p><a href="https://gist.github.com/ashwanirathee/b2bd7b9ad81179b48863c4074ff0258a#file-merge_sort-cu" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Code: Basic Recursive Merge Sort with CUDA</a></p> <h5 id="notes-1">Notes:</h5> <ul> <li> <code>#include &lt;cuda_runtime.h&gt;</code> provides access to the CUDA Runtime API and functions like <code>cudaMalloc()</code>, <code>cudaMemcpy()</code>, <code>cudaFree()</code>, <code>kernel&lt;&lt;&lt;numBlocks, threadsPerBlock&gt;&gt;&gt;(args)</code>, <code>cudaGetErrorString()</code>, <code>cudaGetLastError()</code> </li> <li> <code>__global__ void mergeSort(uint8_t* arr, uint8_t* temp, long long left, long long right)</code> is the kernel function which is launched for each merge operation which for now does exactly the same thing as the CPU implementation</li> <li>Within <code>void mergeSort(....)</code> <ul> <li> <code>merge&lt;&lt;&lt;1, 1&gt;&gt;&gt;(...)</code> launches the kernel for each merge operation but right now just launches a single thread to do entire merge which is not efficient. <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;1,1&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> specifies the number of thread blocks and num of threads per thread block. <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;numBlocks, blockSize&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> is the syntax for launching a kernel in CUDA.

Deep recursion is problematic as it can lead to stack overflow given the small size of threads on the GPU. There is a non trivial kernel launch overhead for each merge operation. Recursion doesn’t allow for a lot of parallelism. Syncronization is also a problem.</li> </ul> </li> <li>How can we make things better? <ul> <li>Rewrite the recursion into an iterative loop and do bottom up merge sort.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Unlike CPU implementations, where recursion is commonly used, CUDA requires an iterative approach with careful memory management and thread synchronization to achieve optimal performance as shown in implementations below.</p> <h2 id="bottom-up-iterative-merge-sort">Bottom Up Iterative Merge Sort</h2> <p>Since CUDA does not efficiently handle recursion due to stack limitations, we implement an iterative approach for merge sort instead. Core of the iterative approach is to merge the array in a bottom up manner. We start by merging the smallest subarrays of size 1, then merge the subarrays of size 2, then 4, 8, 16, and so on.</p> <div><pre><code><span>MERGE_SORT</span><span>(</span><span>arr</span><span>,</span> <span>temp</span><span>,</span> <span>start</span><span>,</span> <span>end</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div> <h4 id="notes-4">Notes:</h4> <ul> <li>It took me a ton of time to understand the indexing and how to launch the kernel for the merge operation properly. I launch 1d grids and 1d blocks. <code>blockIdx.x</code> gives the block index which could be 1,2,3,4,… and then <code>blockDim.x</code> specifies the number of threads in a block. <code>blockIdx.x * blockDim.x</code> after we add it <code>threadIdx.x</code>(0 to THREADS_PER_BLOCK-1) gives the index of the thread globally where each index is unique.</li> <li>Now we are able to uniquely identify our thread globally, we want to give it a <code>unique subproblem</code> depending on this <code>index</code>. We now shift our focus on calculating the <code>left</code>, <code>mid</code>, and <code>right</code> indices for the subarray we want to merge. We have a array of size n, each thread is supposed to deal with subproblems of size <code>2 * curr_size</code> starting from <code>left</code> to <code>right</code>.</li> <li> <code>Most Important question</code>: how many indexes I have? index= <code>blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x</code> and if the blockIdx.x is 0 and threadIdx.x is 0, we have minimum index as 0. We know max blockIdx.x is gridSize-1. So the maximum index is <code>(gridSize-1) * blockDim.x + blockDim.x - 1</code> creating <code>gridSize * blockDim.x -1</code> as max. If we replace gridSize with <code>numThreads + THREADS_PER_BLOCK -1 / THREADS_PER_BLOCK</code> and blockDim.x with <code>THREADS_PER_BLOCK</code>, we get <code>numThreads + THREADS_PER_BLOCK - 2</code>. So the maximum index is approximately <code>n / 2 × curr_size​</code> to cater to our subproblems with some extra threads.</li> <li>Given we have indexes from 0 to <code>n/2 * curr_size</code>, we can calculate the <code>left index</code> as <code>2 * curr_size * index</code> which roughly covers all of the array. If we have <code>left &gt;= n</code> we return as we have covered the whole array. There was an interesting edge case where this left was previously an <code>int</code> leading to overflow and I had to change it to <code>long long</code>, I found that error with <code>compute-sanitizer</code> and using debug symbols by using <code>-g -G</code> while compiling with nvcc.</li> <li>After we find <code>left</code>, <code>mid</code>, <code>right</code>, it’s the same old merge logic.</li> <li>I tried with different values of <code>THREADS_PER_BLOCK</code> but results were almost the same.</li> </ul> <h3 id="results">Results</h3> <p>We defined the task of generating the random arrays on CPU, doing sorting on CPU/GPU and then comparing with the standard sorting method <code>std::sort</code> on CPU.</p> <ul> <li>Bottom-up iterative merge sort in CUDA significantly improves efficiency by parallelizing merge operations</li> <li>It’s not unexpected to see that <code>CPU approaches</code> do better for smaller arrays for the overall wall clock times of the program.</li> <li> <code>thrust::sort</code> comes out to be better than my implementations for larger arrays where <code>GPU iterative method</code> is <code>reasonably competitive</code> while recursive approach is way behind.</li> <li> <code>CPU</code> approaches i.e. recursive and iterative are very competitive with <code>std::sort</code> </li> <li>10^7 is the tipping point where the GPU sort with <code>thrust::sort</code> beats the standard sorting on CPU and my implementation <code>GPU iterative</code> comes very close too.</li> <li>The overhead for sending the data to the GPU and bringing back data from GPU is likely the cause for the time difference between CPU and GPU approaches for size 10^1 to 10^4.</li> </ul> <div> <figure> <picture> <source srcset="https://ashwanirathee.com/assets/img/merge_sort_comparison_iterative-480.webp 480w,https://ashwanirathee.com/assets/img/merge_sort_comparison_iterative-800.webp 800w,https://ashwanirathee.com/assets/img/merge_sort_comparison_iterative-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"> <img src="https://ashwanirathee.com/assets/img/merge_sort_comparison_iterative.png" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <h3 id="conclusion-and-future-work">Conclusion and Future Work</h3> <p>I learned a lot about merge sort which had elluded me for a very long time. This simple algorithm also gave a very nice opportunity to learn the basics of CUDA with medium difficulty. There are several things that I could have done better and I would like to explore in the future:</p> <ul> <li>Define the tasks better or more tasks where goals could be: <ul> <li>Things need to start from CPU and endup on the GPU only for further computation or vice versa</li> <li>Things need to start and end on the individual devices only.</li> <li>Things need to start on GPU and go to CPU for further computation.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Attempt implementing <code>Parallel Merge Sort</code> as suggested by <code>Prof Rezaul</code> at <code>SBU</code> in references [1]</li> <li>Compare way bigger arrays going from <code>10^7 to 10^18</code> and <code>stress testing</code> how much sorting we can do on either of the devices.</li> <li>Optimize further for performance on GPU by using <code>shared memory</code>, using <code>thrust:sort</code> at <code>specific level</code> in combination with my implementation like we do long multiplication in the karatsuba algorithm for size of n &lt; 20 as I was taught in <code>CSE 201</code> by <code>Prof Sesh</code>.</li> <li>Utilize the threads in CPU implementations to see if that can be useful for improving performance.</li> <li>Compare the effects of using different sizes of <code>THREAD_PER_BLOCK</code> and maybe rather than each thread solving 1 subproblems, <code>each threads solve more than 1 subproblems</code> given we are waiting till all threads finish.</li> </ul> <h3 id="references">References:</h3> <ul> <li><a href="https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~rezaul/Spring-2019/CSE613/CSE613-lecture-7.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof Rezaul's Notes on Parallel Algorithms</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GeeksForGeeks: MergeSort</a></li> <li><a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/even-easier-introduction-cuda/%0A" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">NVIDIA's Introduction to CUDA by Mark Harris</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XOZ2IiP2nw" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">MergeSort Explanation on Youtube</a></li> </ul> </div> </article></div>]]></description>
