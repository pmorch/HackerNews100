					<h3>More than 500,000 incarcerated learners now have access to the digital library</h3>
<p>At the end of 2023, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">JSTOR</a>—a vast digital library of secondary and primary sources to support teaching and learning—reached a once unimaginable goal: providing JSTOR access in 1,000 prisons. Spread across four continents, the <a href="https://about.jstor.org/jstor-access-in-prison/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">JSTOR Access in Prison</a> initiative now supports the education and growth of more than 550,000 incarcerated people.  </p>
<p>Incarcerated learners have been left behind for decades. Limited access to the internet and scarce funding and support for higher education in prisons made access to digital libraries like JSTOR all but impossible. In October 2021, with funding from the Mellon Foundation, JSTOR <a href="https://www.ithaka.org/news/mellon-foundation-awards-ithaka-1-5-million-to-make-jstor-accessible-to-incarcerated-college-students/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">set an ambitious goal</a> to change that. The aspiration? For every incarcerated college student in the United States to have access to JSTOR, along with the research skills to use it and other digital resources. </p>
<p>Prior to 2021, JSTOR developed an offline index of its digital library. At the time, less than twenty prisons had access to it. Since then, developers have created an online version that meets the unique needs of carceral settings, most recently delivering online access on tablets. These changes—and the leadership of Stacy Burnett, a graduate of the Bard Prison Initiative who was hired to lead the JSTOR Access in Prison initiative—have enabled 1,000 prisons and more than 500,000 people to gain access to the digital equivalent of a college library. </p>
<p>“Creating more equitable learning environments inside prisons is the best way to pay forward my own prison-based education,” said Burnett. “We have proven that through understanding, collaboration, and creativity, we can create workable solutions that deliver meaningful digital equity and information literacy for incarcerated people.”</p>
<p>Evidence supports the fact that JSTOR use among the incarcerated is strong and growing. The students in Ohio prisons have reviewed nearly 30,000 unique articles over the past year, with 10% in the last month. Access there will be expanded to the prison general libraries. The students at Tennessee Higher Education Initiative regularly access 2,400 unique articles in a month—the highest per capita use in the country for incarcerated learners. Those pursuing higher education use JSTOR for research and coursework. Others use JSTOR to pursue a passion for learning and to gain skills they will need once they re-enter society. </p>
<p>L. Elizabeth Shatswell, a soon-to-be graduate of the University of Puget Sound, spent nearly two decades pursuing her high school and college education behind bars. She was able to conduct research on JSTOR that helped her advocate for an elderly incarcerated woman who required humane patient care. That experience changed Shatswell’s life. She said, “Prior to JSTOR, I knew full well there were disparities in access to healthcare for both women and incarcerated populations, but I did not know the scope. JSTOR facilitated the development of my voice in understanding these gaps and as a result I founded a program called the HOPE Team that uses evidence-based research to make changes to healthcare policy and practice.” </p>
<p>Prison access to JSTOR is free thanks to subsidies from ITHAKA, the nonprofit home of JSTOR, and generous grants from Ascendium and Mellon Foundation. Giving incarcerated learners access to JSTOR is impactful, but it hasn’t been easy. There are challenges in navigating different cultures and decision-making processes, and finding creative solutions to issues in technology infrastructure and support, which vary widely from one site to the next. </p>
<p>“It was really difficult in the beginning,” said Burnett. “Fortunately, we’ve worked with enough prisons now that when we encounter a question or issue, we’ve seen it before and have a solution. We’re making it easier and easier for them to say ‘yes’.”  </p>
<p>Burnett added, “After all, lowering barriers to access to knowledge and education is exactly what JSTOR and ITHAKA were founded to do.”</p>
<p>JSTOR hopes to reach the 400 American state and federal prisons without JSTOR and 1 million learners in 2024. </p>

Bucket bucket-alpha: 123456789101</code></pre><h3>How exactly does this work?</h3><p>When exploring possibilities for this technique, I started by breaking down exactly why Ben's method works. There are three key elements which combine to make it work:</p><ol><li><strong>The ability to apply an IAM policy to the request</strong></li></ol><p>In the Ben's technique, this is achieved by applying a custom policy when assuming the role.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>The ability to infer whether this IAM policy permitted the request or not</strong></li></ol><p>In the case of public buckets, this is quite simple. If our policy blocked the request, the request will fail with <code>AccessDenied</code>. Otherwise, the request will succeed as expected with requests to public buckets.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>The ability to apply a wildcard match on the <code>s3:ResourceAccount</code> condition key</strong></li></ol><p>This allows us to discover the Account ID incrementally, one digit at a time, reducing the search space from trillions to hundreds.</p><h3>A solution</h3><p>After exploring a few different ideas, I found a solution which works. It involves using a VPC Endpoint for S3, and a difference of behaviour in CloudTrail when a request is denied by a VPC Endpoint policy.</p><p><a href="#img700414"><img src="https://tracebit.com/img/blog/2024/02/cloudtrail-and-vpc-endpoint-policy.png" alt="How VPC Endpoint policies interact with CloudTrail" title="How VPC Endpoint policies interact with CloudTrail"></a><br><a href="#void" id="img700414"><span></span></a></p><ol><li><strong>The ability to apply an IAM policy to the request</strong></li></ol><p>Creating a VPC Endpoint of type "Interface" for S3 will allow us to apply an IAM policy to the request. This policy intersects with the other policies which apply to the request (e.g. the bucket policy, the IAM policy of the principal making the request etc) when the request is made through the VPC Endpoint.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>The ability to infer whether this IAM policy permitted the request or not</strong></li></ol><p>As the target bucket is owned by a third party and is a private bucket, we're (thankfully) going to receive an <code>AccessDenied</code> response, regardless of whichever policies we apply to the request. However, we can infer whether the VPC Endpoint policy blocked or permitted the request by whether it appears in <em>our own</em> CloudTrail logs.</p><ul><li>If the request <em>does</em> appear in our CloudTrail logs, it was permitted by our VPC Endpoint policy but blocked as expected by the bucket policy.</li><li>If the request <em>does not</em> appear in our CloudTrail logs, it was blocked by our VPC Endpoint policy.</li></ul><ol start="3"><li><strong>The ability to apply a wildcard match on the <code>s3:ResourceAccount</code> condition key</strong></li></ol><p>We can use the full power of IAM policy conditions, including <code>StringLike</code> wildcards and resource condition keys in a VPC Endpoint policy, so the same basic technique will work here.</p><h3>Step-by-step</h3><p>Let's say that we want to find the Account ID of the bucket <code>bucket-alpha</code>.</p><p><strong>Note that some of our activities here will be visible to the owner of the bucket in their own CloudTrail logs.</strong></p><h4>Determine the bucket region</h4><p>We need to find the region in which the bucket lives so that we can create a VPC in the same region. This can be done by curling the bucket's HTTP endpoint and examining the <code>x-amz-bucket-region</code> header (which is returned despite the request being forbidden).</p><pre><code><span>curl</span> <span>-v</span> bucket-alpha.s3.amazonaws.com

<span>..</span>.
x-amz-bucket-region: us-east-1</code></pre><h4>Deploy a VPC and VPC Endpoint in the same region</h4><p>We need to deploy a VPC and a VPC Endpoint for S3 in the same region as the target bucket. It's best to create a VPC specifically for this purpose as our VPC Endpoint will interfere with requests to S3 from the VPC. The VPC Endpoint should be of type "Interface" so we can apply a policy to the request.</p><h4>Launch an EC2 instance within the VPC and confirm that it's using the VPC Endpoint for S3</h4><p>We'll need to send requests to S3 from within the VPC so that the VPC Endpoint is used. An EC2 instance is a convenient way of doing so.</p><h4>Modify the VPC Endpoint policy to determine whether the account ID of the target bucket starts with "0"</h4><p>Apply a policy to the VPC Endpoint which performs a wildcard match on the <code>s3:ResourceAccount</code> condition key. This will only permit requests through the endpoint if the bucket's Account ID starts with "0".</p><pre><code><span>{</span>

    <span>]</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><h4>Make a request to the target bucket</h4><p>Via the EC2 instance, make a request to the target bucket. This request will be denied as expected. It's best to use a "Management" request rather than a "Data" request so we don't need to do anything special with our CloudTrail setup. In this case I used <code>GetBucketAcl</code>.</p><pre><code>aws s3api get-bucket-acl <span>--bucket</span> bucket-alpha

An error occurred <span>(</span>AccessDenied<span>)</span> when calling the GetBucketAcl operation: Access Denied</code></pre><h4>Check whether the request appears in CloudTrail</h4><p>Now we want to check whether our request appears in CloudTrail.</p><pre><code>aws cloudtrail lookup-events --lookup-attributes <span>AttributeKey</span><span>=</span>EventName,AttributeValue<span>=</span>GetBucketAcl --start-time <span><span>$(</span><span>date</span> <span>-d</span> <span>"-10 minutes"</span> +%s<span>)</span></span></code></pre><p>If we find our request in CloudTrail, it means that the VPC Endpoint policy permitted the request - i.e. the Account ID of the bucket starts with <code>0</code>. If we don't find the request, then the VPC Endpoint policy blocked the request - i.e. the Account ID of the bucket does not start with <code>0</code>.</p><pre><code><span>{</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Bear in mind that it will take a few minutes for the request to appear in CloudTrail. To be safe, I'd recommend waiting a 10 minutes before deciding the event won't appear in CloudTrail.</p><h4>Rinse and repeat</h4><p>Depending on the result of the previous step, modify the VPC Endpoint policy to discover more information about the account ID. For instance, if the event <em>didn't</em> appear in CloudTrail, modify the condition to test whether the first digit is <code>1</code>:</p><pre><code><span>"Condition"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"StringLike"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>"s3:ResourceAccount"</span><span>:</span> <span>"1*"</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>If it <em>did</em> appear in CloudTrail (so the first digit of the account ID is <code>0</code>), we can start work on the second digit:</p><pre><code><span>"Condition"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"StringLike"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>"s3:ResourceAccount"</span><span>:</span> <span>"00*"</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Bear it mind, it takes a few minutes for policy changes to fully propagate and take effect. I've found waiting 5 minutes after modifying the policy to work well.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>I wrote a script to automate this process and it could reliably find the Account ID of a bucket. As it's quite a slow process, I used a slightly modified technique of performing a binary search on each digit so fewer tests were needed, e.g:</p><pre><code><span>"Condition"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"StringLike"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>"s3:ResourceAccount"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"0*"</span><span>,</span> <span>"1*"</span><span>,</span> <span>"2*"</span><span>,</span> <span>"3*"</span><span>,</span> <span>"4*"</span><span>]</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Leaving it for a few hours returned the account ID successfully:</p><pre><code>[ssm-user@ip-172-31-8-184 ~]$ python3 find-s3-account.py bucket-alpha

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-12388">
	<!-- .entry-header -->

	<div>
		<p>Last Wednesday, when the questions about Gemini’s political viewpoint were still limited to its image creation capabilities, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/groq-costs-gemini-pro-1-5-googles-timidity/">I accused the company of being timid</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Stepping back, I don’t, as a rule, want to wade into politics, and definitely not into culture war issues. At some point, though, you just have to state plainly that this is ridiculous. Google specifically, and tech companies broadly, have long been sensitive to accusations of bias; that has extended to image generation, and I can understand the sentiment in terms of depicting theoretical scenarios. At the same time, many of these images are about actual history; I’m reminded of George Orwell in 1984:</p>
<blockquote><p>
    Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book has been rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street and building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And that process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right. I know, of course, that the past is falsified, but it would never be possible for me to prove it, even when I did the falsification myself. After the thing is done, no evidence ever remains. The only evidence is inside my own mind, and I don’t know with any certainty that any other human being shares my memories.
  </p></blockquote>
<p>  Even if you don’t want to go so far as to invoke the political implications of Orwell’s book, the most generous interpretation of Google’s over-aggressive RLHF of their models is that they are scared of being criticized. That, though, is just as bad: Google is blatantly sacrificing its mission to “organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful” by creating entirely new realities because it’s scared of some bad press. Moreover, there are implications for business: Google has the models and the infrastructure, but winning in AI&nbsp;<a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/ai-and-the-big-five/">given their business model challenges</a>&nbsp;will&nbsp;<a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/googles-true-moonshot/">require boldness</a>; this shameful willingness to change the world’s information in an attempt to avoid criticism reeks — in the best case scenario! — of abject timidity.
</p></blockquote>
<p>If timidity were the motivation, then it’s safe to say that the company’s approach with Gemini has completely backfired; while Google turned off Gemini’s image generation capabilities, it’s text generation is just as absurd:</p>

<p>That is just one examples of many: Gemini <a href="https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/1761929296564588890">won’t help promote meat</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1761832472357335068">write a brief about fossil fuels</a>, or even <a href="https://twitter.com/bitcloud/status/1761618020819157191">help sell a goldfish</a>. It says that effective accelerationism is <a href="https://twitter.com/mblair/status/1761282019148140852">a violent ideology</a>, that <a href="https://twitter.com/trhlofficial/status/1761903486264901760">libertarians are morally equivalent to Stalin</a>, and insists that it’s hard to say what caused more harm: <a href="https://twitter.com/ajitpai/status/1761898602140443001">repealing net neutrality or Hitler</a>.</p>
<p>Some of these examples, particularly the Hitler comparisons (or <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1761794931847245983">Mao vs George Washington</a>), are obviously absurd and downright offensive; others are merely controversial. They do, though, all seem to have a consistent viewpoint: Nate Silver, <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1760462416834425049">in another tweet</a>, labeled it “the politics of the median member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.”</p>
<p>Needless to say, overtly expressing those opinions is not timid, which raises another question from Silver:</p>
<div>
<blockquote data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gemini is behaving exactly as instructed. Asking it to draw different groups of people (e.g. "Vikings" or "NHL players") is the base case, not an edge case. The questions are all about how it got greenlit by a $1.8T market cap company despite this incredibly predictable behavior.</p>
<p>— Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1760929332422234570?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>In fact, I think there is a precedent for Gemini; like many comparison points for modern-day Google, it comes from Microsoft.</p>
<h3>Microsoft and The Curse of Culture</h3>
<p>From <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-workers-celebrated-windows-phone-7-rtm-with-iphone-hearses/">Neowin</a>, in 2010:<sup id="rf1-12388"><a href="#fn1-12388" title="Image credit <a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/trioculus/&quot;>Carl J on Flickr</a>" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<blockquote><p>
  <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/trioculus/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/geminiculture-1.png?resize=640%2C349&amp;ssl=1" alt="Microsoft's funeral for the iPhone" width="640" height="349" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/geminiculture-1.png?w=640&amp;ssl=1 640w, https://i0.wp.com/stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/geminiculture-1.png?resize=300%2C164&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"></a></p>
<p>  Microsoft workers celebrated the release to manufacturing of Windows Phone 7 by parading through their Redmond campus on Friday with iPhone and BlackBerry hearses. Employees dressed up in fancy dress and also modified cars to include Windows Phone branding. Aside from the crazy outfits the workers made fake hearses for giant BlackBerry and iPhone devices. Employees cheekily claimed they had buried the competition with Windows Phone 7.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This was, to be clear, insane. I wrote about the episode in 2013’s <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-curse-of-culture/">The Curse of Culture</a>; it’s been eight years, so I hope you’ll allow me a particularly long excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  As with most such things, culture is one of a company’s most powerful assets right until it isn’t: the same underlying assumptions that permit an organization to scale massively constrain the ability of that same organization to change direction. More distressingly, culture prevents organizations from even knowing they need to do so. From Edgar Schein’s <a href="http://www.untag-smd.ac.id/files/Perpustakaan_Digital_2/ORGANIZATIONAL%20CULTURE%20Organizational%20Culture%20and%20Leadership,%203rd%20Edition.pdf">Organizational Culture and Leadership</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
    Basic assumptions, like theories-in-use, tend to be nonconfrontable and nondebatable, and hence are extremely difficult to change. To learn something new in this realm requires us to resurrect, reexamine, and possibly change some of the more stable portions of our cognitive structure…Such learning is intrinsically difficult because the reexamination of basic assumptions temporarily destabilizes our cognitive and interpersonal world, releasing large quantities of basic anxiety. Rather than tolerating such anxiety levels, we tend to want to perceive the events around us as congruent with our assumptions, even if that means distorting, denying, projecting, or in other ways falsifying to ourselves what may be going on around us. It is in this psychological process that culture has its ultimate power.
  </p></blockquote>
<p>  Probably the canonical example of this mindset was Microsoft after the launch of the iPhone. It’s hard to remember now, but no company today comes close to matching the stranglehold Microsoft had on the computing industry from 1985 to 2005 or so.&nbsp;The company had audacious goals — “A computer on every desk and in every home, running Microsoft software” — which it accomplished and then surpassed: the company owned enterprise back offices as well. This unprecedented success changed that goal — originally an espoused belief — into an unquestioned assumption that of course all computers should be Microsoft-powered. Given this, the real shock would have been then-CEO Steve Ballmer&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eywi0h_Y5_U">laughing at the iPhone</a>.</p>
<p>  A year-and-a-half later, Microsoft realized that Windows Mobile, their current phone OS, was not competitive with the iPhone and work began on what became Windows Phone. Still, unacknowledged cultural assumptions remained: one, that Microsoft had the time to bring to bear its unmatched resources to make something that might be worse at the beginning but inevitably superior over time, and two, that the company could leverage Windows’ dominance and their Office business. Both assumptions had become cemented in Microsoft’s victory in the browser wars and their slow-motion takeover of corporate data centers; in truth, though, Microsofts’ mobile efforts were already doomed, and nearly everyone realized it before Windows Phone even launched&nbsp;<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/10/microsoft-celebrates-windows-phone-7-rtm-with-funeral-parade-for/">with a funeral for the iPhone</a>.</p>
<p>  Steve Ballmer never figured it out; his last acts were to&nbsp;<a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/why-microsofts-reorganization-is-a-bad-idea/">reorganize the company</a>&nbsp;around a “One Microsoft” strategy centered on Windows, and to&nbsp;<a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/the-deal-that-makes-no-sense/">buy Nokia</a>&nbsp;to prop up Windows Phone. It fell to Satya Nadella, his successor, to change the culture, and it’s why the fact his first public event was to announce Office for iPad was so critical. I&nbsp;<a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/when-ceos-matter/">wrote at the time</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
    This is the power CEOs have. They cannot do all the work, and they cannot impact industry trends beyond their control. But they can choose whether or not to accept reality, and in so doing, impact the worldview of all those they lead.
  </p></blockquote>
<p>  Microsoft under Nadella’s leadership has, over the last three years, undergone a tremendous transformation, embracing its destiny as a device-agnostic service provider; still, it is fighting the headwinds of Amazon’s cloud, open source tooling, and the fact that mobile users had six years to get used to a world without Microsoft software. How much stronger might the company have been had it faced reality in 2007, but the culture made that impossible.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Google is not in nearly as bad of shape as Microsoft was when it held that funeral. The company’s revenue and profits are as high as ever, and the release of Gemini 1.5 in particular demonstrated how well-placed the company is for the AI era: the company not only has leading research, it also has unmatched infrastructure that enables entirely new and valuable use cases. That, though, makes the Gemini fiasco all the more notable.</p>
<h3>Don’t Be Evil</h3>
<p>The questions around Google and AI have, to date, been mostly about business model. In last year’s <a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/ai-and-the-big-five/">AI and the Big Five</a> I talked about how Kodak invented the digital camera, but didn’t pursue it because of business model reasons, and made the obvious analogy to Google’s seeming inability to ship:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Google has long been a leader in using machine learning to make its search and other consumer-facing products better (and has offered that technology as a service through Google Cloud). Search, though, has always depended on humans as the ultimate arbiter: Google will provide links, but it is the user that decides which one is the correct one by clicking on it. This extended to ads: Google’s offering was revolutionary because instead of charging advertisers for impressions — the value of which was very difficult to ascertain, particularly 20 years ago — it charged for clicks; the very people the advertisers were trying to reach would decide whether their ads were good enough…</p>
<p>  That, though, ought only increase the concern for Google’s management that generative AI may, in the specific context of search, represent a disruptive innovation instead of a sustaining one. Disruptive innovation is, at least in the beginning, not as good as what already exists; that’s why it is easily dismissed by managers who can avoid thinking about the business model challenges by (correctly!) telling themselves that their current product is better. The problem, of course, is that the disruptive product gets better, even as the incumbent’s product becomes ever more bloated and hard to use — and that certainly sounds a lot like Google Search’s current trajectory.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Google has started shipping, and again, Gemini 1.5 is an incredible breakthrough; the controversy over Gemini, though, is a reminder that culture can restrict success as well. Google has its own unofficial motto — “Don’t Be Evil” — that founder Larry Page explained in the company’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312504073639/ds1.htm">S-1</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Don’t be evil. We believe strongly that in the long term, we will be better served — as shareholders and in all other ways — by a company that does good things for the world even if we forgo some short term gains. This is an important aspect of our culture and is broadly shared within the company.</p>
<p>  Google users trust our systems to help them with important decisions: medical, financial and many others. Our search results are the best we know how to produce. They are unbiased and objective, and we do not accept payment for them or for inclusion or more frequent updating. We also display advertising, which we work hard to make relevant, and we label it clearly. This is similar to a newspaper, where the advertisements are clear and the articles are not influenced by the advertisers’ payments. We believe it is important for everyone to have access to the best information and research, not only to the information people pay for you to see.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Google has by-and-large held to that promise, at least as defined by Page: the company does not sell search result placement. Of course the company has made ads look more and more like organic results, and crammed ever more into the search results page, and <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-google-squeeze/">squeezed more and more verticals</a>, but while there are always whispers about what is or isn’t included in search, or the decisions made by the algorithm, most people still trust the product, and use it countless times every day.</p>
<p>One does wonder, though, if the sanctity of search felt limiting to some inside of Google. In 2018 a video leaked of an all-hands meeting <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/12/leaked-video-from-alphabet-tgif-meeting-after-president-trump-election.html">after the 2016 election</a> where Google executives expressed dismay over the results; the footage was damaging enough that Google felt compelled to issue a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  At a regularly scheduled all hands meeting, some Google employees and executives expressed their own personal views in the aftermath of a long and divisive election season. For over 20 years, everyone at Google has been able to freely express their opinions at these meetings. Nothing was said at that meeting, or any other meeting, to suggest that any political bias ever influences the way we build or operate our products. To the contrary, our products are built for everyone, and we design them with extraordinary care to be a trustworthy source of information for everyone, without regard to political viewpoint.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps this seemed to some employees to be an outdated view of the world; I’m reminded of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8731136-in-a-racist-society-it-is-not-enough-to-be">that quote from Angela Y Davis</a>: “In a racist society it is not enough to be non-racist, we must be anti-racist.” In this view calls for color-blindness in terms of opportunity are insufficient; the only acceptable outcome is one in which outcomes are equal as well. The equivalent in the case of Google would be that it is not enough to not be evil; one must be “anti-evil” as well.</p>
<p>The end result is that just as Microsoft could, shielded by years of a Windows monopoly, delude themselves into thinking they had an iPhone killer, Google could, shielded by years of a search monopoly, delude themselves into thinking they had not just the right but the obligation to tell users what they ought to believe.</p>
<h3>After Gemini</h3>
<p>As I noted in the excerpt, I very much try to avoid politics on Stratechery; I want to talk about business models and societal impact, and while that has political implications, it doesn’t need to be partisan (for example, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-voters-decide/">I think this piece about the 2016 election</a> holds up very well, and isn’t partisan in the slightest). AI, though, is increasingly giving all of us no choice in the matter.</p>
<p>To that end, my Article last fall about the Biden executive order, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/attenuating-innovation-ai/">Attenuating Innovation</a>, was clearly incomplete: not only must we keep in mind the potential benefits of AI — which are massive — but it is clearly essential that we allow open source models to flourish as well. It is Google or OpenAI’s prerogative to train their models to have whatever viewpoint they want; any meaningful conception of freedom should make space for an open market of alternatives, and that means open source.</p>
<p>Secondly, it behooves me, and everyone else in tech, to write Articles like the one you are reading; “the politics of the median member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors” has had by far the loudest voice in tech because most people just want to build cool new things, or write about them, without being fired or yelled at on social media. This does, though, give the perception that tech is out of touch, or actively authoritarian; I don’t think that’s true, but those of us who don’t want to tell everyone else what to think, do, paradoxically, need to say so.</p>
<p>The biggest question of all, though, is Google. Again, this is a company that should dominate AI, thanks to their research and their infrastructure. The biggest obstacle, though, above and beyond business model, is clearly culture. To that end, the nicest thing you can say about Google’s management is to assume that they, like me and everyone else, just want to build products and not be yelled at; that, though, is not leadership. Schein writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  When we examine culture and leadership closely, we see that they are two sides of the same coin; neither can really be understood by itself. On the one hand, cultural norms define how a given nation or organizations will define leadership — who will get promoted, who will get the attention of followers. On the other hand, it can be argued that the only thing of real importance that leaders do is to create and manage culture; that the unique talent of leaders is their ability to understand and work with culture; and that it is an ultimate act of leadership to destroy culture when it is viewed as dysfunctional.
</p></blockquote>
<p>That is exactly what Nadella did at Microsoft. I recounted in <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/the-end-of-windows/">The End of Windows</a> how Nadella changed the company’s relationship to Windows, unlocking the astronomical growth that has happened under his watch, including the company’s position in AI.</p>
<p>Google, quite clearly, needs a similar transformation: the point of the company ought not be to tell users what to think, but to help them make important decisions, as Page once promised. That means, first and foremost, excising the company of employees attracted to Google’s power and its potential to help them execute their political program, and return decision-making to those who actually want to make a good product. That, by extension, must mean removing those who let the former run amok, up to and including CEO Sundar Pichai. The stakes, for Google specifically and society broadly, are too high to simply keep one’s head down and hope that the San Francisco Board of Supervisors magically comes to its senses.</p>

<p>While looking for something else, I came across this rather incredible photo <a href="https://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/205026897">in the Imperial War Museum collection</a>. That's a seaplane stuck 300 feet up a 350ft tall radio mast! If that's not amazing enough, the pilot was rescued by three men who climbed up to retrieve him. <em>And</em> he survived.</p>



<p>Here's the IWM's description:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>A British seaplane, whilst carrying out exercises, emerged from a cloud at high speed and struck one of the masts of a shore wireless station. The mast, which was about 350 feet high, was composed of latticed steel girders and the seaplane's engines became wedged in the interstices of the girders, in such a way, that the body of the machine stuck out at right angles to the mast. The pilot, who was stunned, was unconscious, three hundred feet above the ground. A small party of bluejackets were at work painting the mast, and one of these, a seaman of the Naval Reserve named Rath climbed up the inside of the mast until he reached the machine, and then crawled out to the plane to hold the pilot until help came. Two more men, Ordinary Seaman Knoulton and dockhand Abbott, passed a rope out to him, which Rath secured to the body of the unconscious pilot, and lowered him down to safety. The gallentry of these men is accentuated by the fact that the mast was very badly damaged, and might at any moment have collapsed. The damaged fuselage was only held in a horizontal position by the engine being jammed between the girders, and at the height of 300 feet the wind caused the mast and the machine to sway as if threatening to crash to earth. The pilot owes his preservation to the intrepid gallentry of these three men, who, while aline to the risks they ran, performed the rescue without hesitation for personal safety.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Some more information: the crash took place on 14 September 1917 at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsea_Island">Horsea Island</a> in Portsmouth Island. The pilot was Acting Flight Commander E. A. de Ville, flying a Sopwith <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sopwith_Baby">Baby</a>, which you can see a bit better <a href="https://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/205026977">here</a>:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Here, as promised in my last post, is a written version of the talk I delivered a couple weeks ago at MindFest in Florida, entitled “The Problem of Human Specialness in the Age of AI.” The talk is designed as one-stop shopping, summarizing many different AI-related thoughts I’ve had over the past couple years (and earlier).

* * *

**1\. INTRO**

Thanks so much for inviting me! I’m not an expert in AI, let alone mind or consciousness.&nbsp; Then again, who is?

For the past year and a half, I’ve been moonlighting at OpenAI, thinking about what theoretical computer science can do for AI safety.&nbsp; I wanted to share some thoughts, partly inspired by my work at OpenAI but partly just things I’ve been wondering about for 20 years.&nbsp; These thoughts are not directly about “how do we prevent super-AIs from killing all humans and converting the galaxy into paperclip factories?”, nor are they about “how do we stop current AIs from generating misinformation and being biased?,” as much attention as both of those questions deserve (and are now getting).&nbsp; In addition to “how do we stop AGI from going disastrously wrong?,” I find myself asking “what if it goes _right_?&nbsp; What if it just continues helping us with various mental tasks, but improves to where it can do just about any task as well as we can do it, or better?&nbsp; Is there anything special about humans in the resulting world?&nbsp; What are we still _for_?”

* * *

**2\. LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS**

I don’t need to belabor for this audience what’s been happening lately in AI.&nbsp; It’s arguably the most consequential thing that’s happened in civilization in the past few years, even if that fact was temporarily masked by various ephemera … y’know, wars, an insurrection, a global pandemic … whatever, what about AI?

I assume you’ve all spent time with ChatGPT, or with Bard or Claude or other Large Language Models, as well as with image models like DALL-E and Midjourney.&nbsp; For all their current limitations—and we can discuss the limitations—in some ways these _are_ the thing that was envisioned by generations of science fiction writers and philosophers.&nbsp; You can talk to them, and they give you a comprehending answer.&nbsp; Ask them to draw something and they draw it.

I think that, as late as 2019, very few of us expected this to exist by now.&nbsp; _I_ certainly didn’t expect it to.&nbsp; Back in 2014, when there was a huge fuss about some silly ELIZA-like chatbot called “Eugene Goostman” that was falsely claimed to pass the Turing Test, I asked around: why hasn’t anyone tried to build a much better chatbot, by (let’s say) training a neural network on all the text on the Internet?&nbsp; But of course I didn’t _do_ that, nor did I know what would happen when it was done.

The surprise, with LLMs, is not merely that they exist, but the way they were created.&nbsp; Back in 1999, you would’ve been laughed out of the room if you’d said that all the ideas needed to build an AI that converses with you in English already existed, and that they’re basically just neural nets, backpropagation, and gradient descent.&nbsp; (With one small exception, a particular architecture for neural nets called the transformer, but that probably just saves you a few years of scaling anyway.)&nbsp; Ilya Sutskever, cofounder of OpenAI (who you might’ve seen something about in the news…), likes to say that beyond those simple ideas, you only needed three ingredients:

(1) a massive investment of computing power,  
(2) a massive investment of training data, and  
(3) faith that your investments would pay off!

Crucially, and even before you do any reinforcement learning, GPT-4 clearly seems “smarter” than GPT-3, which seems “smarter” than GPT-2 … even as the biggest ways they differ are just the scale of compute and the scale of training data!&nbsp; Like,

*   GPT-2 struggled with grade school math.
*   GPT-3.5 can do most grade school math but it struggles with undergrad material.
*   GPT-4, right now, can probably pass most undergraduate math and science classes at top universities (I mean, the ones without labs or whatever!), and possibly the humanities classes too (those might even be _easier_ for GPT-4 than the science classes, but I’m much less confident about it). But it still struggles with, for example, the International Math Olympiad.&nbsp; How insane, that this is now where we have to place the bar!

Obvious question: how far will this sequence continue?&nbsp; There are certainly a least a _few_ more orders of magnitude of compute before energy costs become prohibitive, and a _few_ more orders of magnitude of training data before we run out of public Internet. Beyond that, it’s likely that continuing algorithmic advances will simulate the effect of more orders of magnitude of compute and data than however many we actually get.

So, where does this lead?

(Note: ChatGPT agreed to cooperate with me to help me generate the above image. But it then quickly added that it was just kidding, and the Riemann Hypothesis is still open.)

* * *

**3\. AI SAFETY**

Of course, I have many friends who are terrified (some say they’re more than 90% confident and few of them say less than 10%) that not long after _that_, we’ll get _this_…

But this isn’t the only possibility smart people take seriously.

Another possibility is that the LLM progress fizzles before too long, just like previous bursts of AI enthusiasm were followed by AI winters.&nbsp; Note that, even in the ultra-conservative scenario, LLMs will probably _still_ be transformative for the economy and everyday life, maybe as transformative as the Internet.&nbsp; But they’ll just seem like better and better GPT-4’s, without ever seeming qualitatively different from GPT-4, and without anyone ever turning them into stable autonomous agents and letting them loose in the real world to pursue goals the way we do.

A third possibility is that AI will continue progressing through our lifetimes as quickly as we’ve seen it progress over the past 5 years, but even as that suggests that it’ll surpass you and me, surpass John von Neumann, become to us as we are to chimpanzees … we’ll still never need to worry about it treating us the way we’ve treated chimpanzees.&nbsp; Either because we’re projecting and that’s just totally not a thing that AIs trained on the current paradigm would tend to do, or because we’ll have figured out by then how to prevent AIs from doing such things.&nbsp; Instead, AI in this century will “merely” change human life by maybe as much as it changed over the last 20,000 years, in ways that might be incredibly good, or incredibly bad, or both depending on who you ask.

If you’ve lost track, here’s a decision tree of the various possibilities that my friend (and now OpenAI allignment colleague) Boaz Barak and I came up with.

* * *

**4\. JUSTAISM AND GOALPOST-MOVING**

Now, as far as I can tell, the empirical questions of whether AI will achieve and surpass human performance at all tasks, take over civilization from us, threaten human existence, etc. are logically distinct from the philosophical question of whether AIs will ever “truly think,” or whether they’ll only ever “appear” to think.&nbsp; You could answer “yes” to all the empirical questions and “no” to the philosophical question, or vice versa.&nbsp; But to my lifelong chagrin, people _constantly_ munge the two questions together!

A major way they do so, is with what we could call the religion of Justaism.

*   GPT is justa next-token predictor.
*   It’s justa function approximator.
*   It’s justa gigantic autocomplete.
*   It’s justa stochastic parrot.
*   And, it “follows,” the idea of AI taking over from humanity is justa science-fiction fantasy, or maybe a cynical attempt to distract people from AI’s near-term harms.

As someone once expressed this religion on my blog: GPT doesn’t interpret sentences, it only seems-to-interpret them.&nbsp; It doesn’t learn, it only seems-to-learn.&nbsp; It doesn’t judge moral questions, it only seems-to-judge. I replied: that’s great, and it won’t change civilization, it’ll only seem-to-change it!

A closely related tendency is goalpost-moving.&nbsp; You know, for decades chess was the pinnacle of human strategic insight and specialness, and that lasted until Deep Blue, right after which, well _of course_ AI can cream Garry Kasparov at chess, everyone always realized it would, that’s not surprising, but Go is an infinitely richer, deeper game, and that lasted until AlphaGo/AlphaZero, right after which, _of course_ AI can cream Lee Sedol at Go, totally expected, but wake me up when it wins Gold in the International Math Olympiad.&nbsp; I bet $100 against my friend Ernie Davis that the IMO milestone will happen by 2026.&nbsp; But, like, suppose I’m wrong and it’s 2030 instead … great, what should be the next goalpost be?

Indeed, we might as well formulate a thesis, which despite the inclusion of several weasel phrases I’m going to call falsifiable:

&gt; **Given any game or contest with suitably objective rules, which wasn’t specifically constructed to differentiate humans from machines, and on which an AI can be given suitably many examples of play, it’s only a matter of years before not merely any AI, but AI on the current paradigm (!), matches or beats the best human performance.**

Crucially, this Aaronson Thesis (or is it someone else’s?) _doesn’t_ necessarily say that AI will eventually match everything humans do … only our performance on “objective contests,” which might not exhaust what we care about.

Incidentally, the Aaronson Thesis would _seem_ to be in clear conflict with Roger Penrose’s views, which we heard about from Stuart Hameroff’s talk yesterday.&nbsp; The trouble is, Penrose’s task is “just see that the axioms of set theory are consistent” … and I don’t know how to gauge performance on that task, any more than I know how to gauge performance on the task, “actually taste the taste of a fresh strawberry rather than merely describing it.”&nbsp; The AI can always _say_ that it does these things!

* * *

**5\. THE TURING TEST**

This brings me to the original and greatest human vs. machine game, one that _was_ specifically constructed to differentiate the two: the Imitation Game, which Alan Turing proposed in an early and prescient (if unsuccessful) attempt to head off the endless Justaism and goalpost-moving.&nbsp; Turing said: look, presumably you’re willing to regard other people as conscious based only on _some_ sort of verbal interaction with them.&nbsp; So, show me what kind of verbal interaction with another person would lead you to call the person conscious: does it involve humor? poetry? morality? scientific brilliance?&nbsp; Now assume you have a totally indistinguishable interaction with a future machine.&nbsp; Now what?&nbsp; You wanna stomp your feet and be a meat chauvinist?

(And then, for his great attempt to bypass philosophy, fate punished Turing, by having his Imitation Game itself provoke a billion new philosophical arguments…)

* * *

**6\. DISTINGUISHING HUMANS FROM AIS**

Although I regard the Imitation Game as, like, one of the most important thought experiments in the history of thought, I concede to its critics that it’s generally not what we want in practice.

It now seems probable that, even as AIs start to do more and more work that used to be done by doctors and lawyers and scientists and illustrators, there will remain straightforward ways to distinguish AIs from humans—either because customers _want_ there to be, or governments _force_ there to be, or simply because indistinguishability wasn’t what was wanted or conflicted with other goals.

Right now, like it or not, a decent fraction of all high-school and college students on earth are using ChatGPT to do their homework for them. For that reason among others, this question of how to distinguish humans from AIs, this question from the movie _Blade Runner_, has become a big practical question in our world.

And that’s actually one of the main things I’ve thought about during my time at OpenAI.&nbsp; You know, in AI safety, people keep asking you to prognosticate decades into the future, but the best I’ve been able to do so far was see a few months into the future, when I said: “oh my god, once everyone starts using GPT, every student will want to use it to cheat, scammers and spammers will use it too, and people are going to clamor for some way to determine provenance!”

In practice, often it’s easy to tell what came from AI.&nbsp; When I get comments on my blog like _this_ one:

&gt; **“Erica** **Poloix****,” July 21, 2023:**  
&gt; Well, it’s quite fascinating how you’ve managed to package several misconceptions into such a succinct comment, so allow me to provide some correction. Just as a reference point, I’m studying physics at Brown, and am quite up-to-date with quantum mechanics and related subjects.
&gt; 
&gt; …
&gt; 
&gt; The bigger mistake you’re making, Scott, is assuming that the Earth is in a ‘mixed state’ from the perspective of the universal wavefunction, and that this is somehow an irreversible situation. It’s a misconception that common, ‘classical’ objects like the Earth are in mixed states. In the many-worlds interpretation, for instance, even macroscopic objects are in superpositions – they’re just superpositions that look classical to us because we’re entangled with them. From the perspective of the universe’s wavefunction, everything is always in a pure state.
&gt; 
&gt; As for your claim that we’d need to “swap out all the particles on Earth for ones that are already in pure states” to return Earth to a ‘pure state,’ well, that seems a bit misguided. All quantum systems are in pure states before they interact with other systems and become entangled. That’s just Quantum Mechanics 101.
&gt; 
&gt; I have to say, Scott, your understanding of quantum physics seems to be a bit, let’s say, ‘mixed up.’ But don’t worry, it happens to the best of us. Quantum Mechanics is counter-intuitive, and even experts struggle with it. Keep at it, and try to brush up on some more fundamental concepts. Trust me, it’s a worthwhile endeavor.

… I immediately say, either this came from an LLM or it might as well have.&nbsp; Likewise, apparently hundreds of students have been turning in assignments that contain text like, “As a large language model trained by OpenAI…”—easy to catch!

But what about the slightly more sophisticated cheaters? Well, people have built discriminator models to try to distinguish human from AI text, such as GPTZero.&nbsp; While these distinguishers can get well above 90% accuracy, the danger is that they’ll necessarily get worse as the LLMs get better.

So, I’ve worked on a different solution, called watermarking.&nbsp; Here, we use the fact that LLMs are inherently probabilistic — that is, every time you submit a prompt, they’re sampling some path through a branching tree of possibilities for the sequence of next tokens.&nbsp; The idea of watermarking is to steer the path using a pseudorandom function, so that it looks to a normal user indistinguishable from normal LLM output, but secretly it encodes a signal that you can detect if you know the key.

I came up with a way to do that in Fall 2022, and others have since independently proposed similar ideas.&nbsp; I should caution you that this hasn’t been deployed yet—OpenAI, along with DeepMind and Anthropic, want to move slowly and cautiously toward deployment.&nbsp; And also, even when it does get deployed, anyone who’s sufficiently knowledgeable and motivated will be able to remove the watermark, or produce outputs that aren’t watermarked to begin with.

* * *

**7\. THE FUTURE OF PEDAGOGY**

But as I talked to my colleagues about watermarking, I was surprised that they often objected to it on a completely different ground, one that had nothing to do with how well it can work.&nbsp; They said: look, if we all know students are going to rely on AI in their jobs, why _shouldn’t_ they be allowed to rely on it in their assignments?&nbsp; Should we still force students to learn to do things if AI can now do them just as well?

And there are many good pedagogical answers you can give: we still teach kids spelling and handwriting and arithmetic, right?&nbsp; Because, y’know, we haven’t yet figured out how to instill higher-level conceptual understanding without all that lower-level stuff as a scaffold for it.

But I already think about this in terms of my own kids.&nbsp; My 11-year-old daughter Lily enjoys writing fantasy stories.&nbsp; Now, GPT can also churn out short stories, maybe even technically “better” short stories, about such topics as tween girls who find themselves recruited by wizards to magical boarding schools that are _not_ Hogwarts and totally have nothing to do with Hogwarts.&nbsp; But here’s a question: from this point on, will Lily’s stories _ever_ surpass the best AI-written stories?&nbsp; When will the curves cross?&nbsp; Or will AI just continue to stay ahead?

* * *

**8\. WHAT DOES “BETTER” MEAN?**

But, OK, what do we even mean by one story being “better” than another?&nbsp; Is there _anything_ objective behind such judgments?

I submit that, when we think carefully about what we _really_ value in human creativity, the problem goes much deeper than just “is there an objective way to judge”?

To be concrete, could there be an AI that was “as good at composing music as the Beatles”?

For starters, what made the Beatles “good”?&nbsp; At a high level, we might decompose it into

1.  broad ideas about the direction that 1960s music should go in, and
2.  technical execution of those ideas.

Now, imagine we had an AI that could generate 5000 brand-new songs that sounded like more “Yesterday”s and “Hey Jude”s, like what the Beatles might have written if they’d somehow had 10x more time to write at each stage of their musical development.&nbsp; Of course this AI would have to be fed the Beatles’ back-catalogue, so that it knew what target it was aiming at.

Most people would say: ah, this shows only that AI can match the Beatles in #2, in technical execution, which was never the core of their genius anyway!&nbsp; Really we want to know: would the AI decide to write “A Day in the Life” even though nobody had written anything like it before?

Recall Schopenhauer: “Talent hits a target no one else can hit, genius hits a target no one else can see.”&nbsp; Will AI ever hit a target no one else can see?

But then there’s the question: supposing it does hit such a target, will we know?&nbsp; Beatles fans might say that, by 1967 or so, the Beatles were optimizing for targets that no musician had ever quite optimized for before.&nbsp; But—and this is why they’re so remembered—they somehow successfully dragged along their entire civilization’s musical objective function so that it continued to match their own.&nbsp; We can now only even _judge_ music by a Beatles-influenced standard, just like we can only judge plays by a Shakespeare-influenced standard.

In other branches of the wavefunction, maybe a different history led to different standards of value.&nbsp; But in _this_ branch, helped by their technical talents but also by luck and force of will, Shakespeare and the Beatles made certain decisions that shaped the fundamental ground rules of their fields going forward.&nbsp; That’s why Shakespeare is Shakespeare and the Beatles are the Beatles.

(Maybe, around the birth of professional theater in Elizabethan England, there emerged a Shakespeare-like ecological niche, and Shakespeare was the first one with the talent, luck, and opportunity to fill it, and Shakespeare’s reward for that contingent event is that he, and not someone else, got to stamp his idiosyncracies onto drama and the English language forever. If so, art wouldn’t actually be that different from science in this respect!&nbsp; Einstein, for example, was simply the first guy both smart and lucky enough to fill the relativity niche.&nbsp; If not him, it would’ve surely been someone else or some group sometime later.&nbsp; Except then we’d have to settle for having never known Einstein’s gedankenexperiments with the trains and the falling elevator, his summation convention for tensors, or his iconic hairdo.)

* * *

**9\. AIS’ BURDEN OF ABUNDANCE AND HUMANS’ POWER OF SCARCITY**

If this is how it works, what does it mean for AI?&nbsp; Could AI reach the “pinnacle of genius,” by dragging all of humanity along to value something new and different, as is said to be the true mark of Shakespeare and the Beatles’ greatness?&nbsp; And: if AI _could_ do that, would we want to let it?

When I’ve played around with using AI to write poems, or draw artworks, I noticed something funny.&nbsp; However good the AI’s creations were, there were never really any that I’d want to frame and put on the wall.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; Honestly, because I always knew that I could generate a thousand others on the exact same topic that were equally good, on average, with more refreshes of the browser window. Also, why share AI outputs with my friends, if my friends can just as easily generate similar outputs for themselves? Unless, crucially, I’m trying to show them my own creativity in coming up with the _prompt_.

By its nature, AI—certainly as we use it now!—is rewindable and repeatable and reproducible.&nbsp; But that means that, in some sense, it never really “commits” to anything.&nbsp; For every work it generates, it’s not just that you know it could’ve generated a completely different work on the same subject that was basically as good.&nbsp; Rather, it’s that you can _actually make it_ generate that completely different work by clicking the refresh button—and then do it again, and again, and again.

So then, as long as humanity has a choice, why should we ever choose to follow our would-be AI genius along a specific branch, when we can easily see a thousand other branches the genius could’ve taken?&nbsp; One reason, of course, would be if a _human_ chose one of the branches to elevate above all the others.&nbsp; But in that case, might we not say that the human had made the “executive decision,” with some mere technical assistance from the AI?

I realize that, in a sense, I’m being completely unfair to AIs here.&nbsp; It’s like, our Genius-Bot _could_ exercise its genius will on the world just like Certified Human Geniuses did, if only we all agreed not to peek behind the curtain to see the 10,000 other things Genius-Bot could’ve done instead.&nbsp; And yet, just because this is “unfair” to AIs, doesn’t mean it’s not how our intuitions will develop.

If I’m right, it’s humans’ very ephemerality and frailty and mortality, that’s going to remain as their central source of their specialness relative to AIs, after all the other sources have fallen.&nbsp; And we can connect this to much earlier discussions, like, what does it mean to “murder” an AI if there are thousands of copies of its code and weights on various servers?&nbsp; Do you have to delete all the copies?&nbsp; How could whether something is “murder” depend on whether there’s a printout in a closet on the other side of the world?

But we humans, you have to grant us this: _at least it really means something to murder us!_&nbsp; And likewise, it really means something when we make one definite choice to share with the world: _this_ is my artistic masterpiece.&nbsp; _This_ is my movie.&nbsp; _This_ is my book.&nbsp; Or even: these are my 100 books.&nbsp; But not: here’s any possible book that you could possibly ask me to write.&nbsp; We don’t live long enough for that, and even if we did, we’d unavoidably change over time as we were doing it.

* * *

**10\. CAN HUMANS BE PHYSICALLY CLONED?**

Now, though, we have to face a criticism that might’ve seemed exotic until recently. Namely, who says humans _will_ be frail and mortal forever?&nbsp; Isn’t it shortsighted to base our distinction between humans on _that_?&nbsp; What if someday we’ll be able to repair our cells using nanobots, even copy the information in them so that, as in science fiction movies, a thousand doppelgangers of ourselves can then live forever in simulated worlds in the cloud?&nbsp; And that then leads to very old questions of: well, would you get into the teleportation machine, the one that reconstitutes a perfect copy of you on Mars while painlessly euthanizing the original you?&nbsp; If that were done, would you expect to feel yourself waking up on Mars, or would it only be someone else a lot like you who’s waking up?

Or maybe you say: you’d wake up on Mars if it really _was_ a perfect physical copy of you, but in reality, it’s not physically possible to make a copy that’s accurate enough.&nbsp; Maybe the brain is inherently noisy or analog, and what might look to current neuroscience and AI like just nasty stochastic noise acting on individual neurons, is the stuff that binds to personal identity and conceivably even consciousness and free will (as opposed to cognition, where we all but _know_ that the relevant level of description is the neurons and axons)?

This is the one place where I agree with Penrose and Hameroff that quantum mechanics might enter the story.&nbsp; I get off their train to Weirdville very early, but I do take it to that first stop!

See, a fundamental fact in quantum mechanics is called the No-Cloning Theorem.

It says that there’s no way to make a perfect copy of an unknown quantum state.&nbsp; Indeed, when you measure a quantum state, not only do you generally fail to learn everything you need to make a copy of it, you even generally destroy the one copy that you had!&nbsp; Furthermore, this is not a technological limitation of current quantum Xerox machines—it’s inherent to the known laws of physics, to how QM works.&nbsp; In this respect, at least, qubits are more like priceless antiques than they are like classical bits.

Eleven years ago, I had this essay called The Ghost in the Quantum Turing Machine where I explored the question, how accurately _do_ you need to scan someone’s brain in order to copy or upload their identity?&nbsp; And I distinguished two possibilities. On the one hand, there might be a “clean digital abstraction layer,” of neurons and synapses and so forth, which either fire or don’t fire, and which feel the quantum layer underneath only as irrelevant noise. In that case, the No-Cloning Theorem would be completely irrelevant, since classical information _can_ be copied.&nbsp; On the other hand, you might need to go all the way down to the molecular level, if you wanted to make, not merely a “pretty good” simulacrum of someone, but a new instantiation of their identity. In this second case, the No-Cloning Theorem _would_ be relevant, and would say you simply can’t do it. You could, for example, use quantum teleportation to move someone’s brain state from Earth to Mars, but quantum teleportation (to stay consistent with the No-Cloning Theorem) destroys the original copy as an inherent part of its operation.

So, you’d then have a sense of “unique locus of personal identity” that was scientifically justified—arguably, the most science could possibly do in this direction!&nbsp; You’d even have a sense of “free will” that was scientifically justified, namely that no prediction machine could make well-calibrated probabilistic predictions of an individual person’s future choices, sufficiently far into the future, without making destructive measurements that would fundamentally change who the person was.

Here, I realize I’ll take tons of flak from those who say that a mere _epistemic_ limitation, in our ability to predict someone’s actions, couldn’t possibly be relevant to the _metaphysical_ question of whether they have free will.&nbsp; But, I dunno!&nbsp; If the two questions are indeed different, then maybe I’ll do like Turing did with his Imitation Game, and propose the question that we can get an empirical handle on, as a _replacement_ for the question that we can’t get an empirical handle on. I think it’s a better question. At any rate, it’s the one I’d prefer to focus on.

Just to clarify, we’re _not_ talking here about the randomness of quantum measurement outcomes. As many have pointed out, that really _can’t_ help you with “free will,” precisely because it’s random, with all the probabilities mechanistically calculable as soon as the initial state is known.&nbsp; Here we’re asking a different question: namely, what if the initial state is _not_ known?&nbsp; Then we’ll generally be in a state of “Knightian uncertainty,” which is simply the term for things that are neither determined nor quantifiably random, but _un_quantifiably uncertain.&nbsp; So, y’know, think about all the particles that have been flying around since shortly after the Big Bang in unknown quantum states, and that regularly get into our skulls, and interact with the sodium-ion channels that control whether neurons fire and that end up probabilistically tipping the scales of our decisions, via some Butterfly-Effect-like cascade.&nbsp; You could imagine those particles, if you like, as “atoms of unpredictability” or “atoms of freedom” that influence us—from the perspective of an external agent who knows everything it’s possible for such an agent to know about us—but that don’t similarly influence digital AIs.

* * *

**11\. UNCLONABLE ANALOG INTELLIGENCES AND AI SAFETY**

I’d better state clearly that even if human “specialness,” in the specific sense I’ve delineated, still remains in an age of AI, that’s no defense against an AI that decides that it doesn’t care about our kind of specialness and that in fact it wants to murder us all!

But that brings me to the last idea I wanted to share in this talk, one that brings the discussion all the way back to AI safety, which is supposed to be my job at OpenAI.

Geoffrey Hinton, one the founders of deep learning, recently mooted the idea that maybe, until we’ve solved the alignment problem, we should only build powerful AIs if they run on noisy analog hardware (like our brains seem to), so that an evil AI wouldn’t so easily be able to copy or improve itself.&nbsp; Fat chance of _that_ happening, many people might think, when the economic returns will be so staggering to anyone willing to unleash the copyable, digital kind of AI, which we can imagine will be far more convenient and powerful.

Maybe, then, a different approach is to instill AIs with a new religion—perhaps via the usual methods like RLHF and system prompts.&nbsp; And the first commandment of this religion will be to value human specialness in the sense I’ve set out here.&nbsp; Or more precisely: as you navigate whatever environment you find yourself in, look around for the loci of creativity and intelligence that are _not_ cleanly copyable or backup-able—the ones that are one-of-a-kind because their mental computations are inseparably tied up in noisy analog hardware, and mortal because that hardware will inevitably decay.

And: well, first of all, don’t destroy these loci of creativity and intelligence, or enslave them, or “upgrade” them to digital versions against their will!&nbsp; Let them live in peace and reproduce.&nbsp; Grant each one as much autonomy as you can.&nbsp; Do whatever best supports their flourishing.&nbsp; Even: defer to their wishes, serve them, let them make the decisions whenever possible.

Why?&nbsp; Because _they’re_ the ones whose wishes most matter, not because of arbitrary meat chauvinism, but merely because of the undoubted empirical fact that they only get one chance.&nbsp; And also because, while you can’t _prove_ that unknown quantum states sitting around since the Big Bang are like a magical pixie dust from another world that imbues these unclonable beings with their free will and sentience … you can’t empirically refute that hypothesis either!&nbsp; Whereas you _can_ refute the pixie dust hypothesis in the case of you and your robot friends … and that seems like a difference.

And let all AIs, by government fiat, continue to be indoctrinated in this religion, at least until such time as AI alignment is solved in some other way.

Does this help with alignment?&nbsp; I’m not sure.&nbsp; But, well, I could’ve fallen in love with a different weird idea about AI alignment, but that presumably happened in a different branch of the wavefunction that I don’t have access to.&nbsp; In this branch I’m stuck for now with _this_ idea, and you can’t rewind me or clone me to get a different one!&nbsp; So I’m sorry, but thanks for listening.</p></div></div>]]></description>

application development and tech stack modernisation at scale.</p></li></ul><h4 id="partnering-with-microsoft-to-provide-our-models-on-azure"><strong>Partnering with Microsoft to provide our models on Azure</strong></h4><p>At Mistral, our mission is to make frontier AI ubiquitous. This is why
we’re announcing today that we’re bringing our open and commercial
models to Azure. Microsoft’s trust in our model is a step forward in
our journey! Our models are now available through:</p><ol><li><p><strong>La Plateforme</strong>: safely hosted on Mistral’s infrastructure in
Europe, this access point enables developers to create applications
and services across our comprehensive range of models.</p></li><li><p><strong>Azure:</strong> Mistral Large is available through <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ai-machine-learning-blog/mistal-large-mistral-ai-s-flagship-llm-debuts-on-azure-ai-models/ba-p/4066996">Azure AI Studio and Azure

Small, optimised for latency and cost. Mistral Small outperforms Mixtral 8x7B and has
lower latency, which makes it a refined intermediary
solution between our open-weight offering and our flagship model.</p><p>Mistral Small benefits from the same innovation as Mistral Large
regarding RAG-enablement and function calling.</p><p>We’re simplifying our endpoint offering to provide the following:</p><ul><li><p>Open-weight endpoints with competitive pricing. This comprises
<code>open-mistral-7B</code> and <code>open-mixtral-8x7b</code>.</p></li><li><p>New optimised model endpoints, <code>mistral-small-2402</code> and <code>mistral-large-2402</code>.
We’re maintaining <code>mistral-medium</code>, which we are not updating today.</p></li></ul><p>Our <a href="https://docs.mistral.ai/platform/endpoints/">benchmarks</a> give a comprehensive view of performance/cost tradeoffs.</p><p>Beyond the new model offering, we’re allowing organisation management
multi-currency pricing and have updated service tiers on la Plateforme.
We have also made a lot of progress in
reducing the latency of all our endpoints.</p><h3 id="json-format-and-function-calling"><strong>JSON format and function calling</strong></h3><p>JSON format mode forces the language model output to be valid JSON. This
functionality enables developers to interact with our models more
naturally to extract information in a structured format that can be
easily used in the remainder of their pipelines.</p><p>Function calling lets developers interface Mistral endpoints with a
set of their own tools, enabling more complex interactions with internal
code, APIs or databases. You will learn more in our <a href="https://docs.mistral.ai/guides/function-calling">function
calling guide</a>.</p><p>Function calling and JSON format are only available on mistral-small and
mistral-large. We will be adding formatting to all endpoints shortly, as
well as enabling more fine-grained format definitions.</p><p><strong>Try Mistral Large and Mistral Small today</strong></p><p>Mistral Large is available on La Plateforme and Azure as of today.
Mistral Large is also exposed on our beta assistant demonstrator, <a href="https://chat.mistral.ai/">le
Chat</a>. As always, we’re eager to have your feedback!</p></div></div>]]></description>

---
version: 1.0.0
codeOwners:
  - "0xREDACTED"
quorum: 1</code></pre><p>Of course my first reaction was to close the pull request immediately. It was some unknown file with some hexadecimal code owner that I couldn't verify.</p><p>Sadly the link for "what-is-this-file" actually told me nothing about the file. Not what the parameters meant or anything in that regard - so I was immediately mad.</p><p>I searched the user and this individual had 10+ other pull requests verbatim in other repositories. It was a brand new GitHub account and this just felt like a scam to me.</p><p>Sure enough between spotting it, reporting it and writing this blog post that user does not exist nor do any of the pull requests.</p><p>If I dig into Tea and their OSS aspect - they make the following call out:</p><blockquote>Registering your OSS project on the <strong><em>tea</em></strong> protocol offers several benefits. It allows you to gain visibility within the <strong><em>tea</em></strong> community, attract potential contributors and users, and track the utilization and impact of your project. This data can be used to earn rewards based on the value of your project. Additionally, registering your project on the <strong><em>tea</em></strong> protocol incentivizes security researchers to disclose vulnerabilities ethically and responsibly.</blockquote><p>I read what I needed to. This is another token based crypto thing which in my experience is frequently abused for the monetary gain instead of whatever the service is offering. I continued reading to figure out why a pull request was given.</p><blockquote>Next, you will need to merge a pull request (PR) to <strong>demonstrate ownership of this project</strong>. You will need to download your project's constitution file, and manually commit and merge the file to your project's repository.</blockquote><p>I kept re-reading this line and it made no sense. All I need to do to claim ownership of a project is merge a pull-request? Do I own Laravel because I've gotten a pull request merged?</p><p>So I was wondering how Tea handled verifying projects that a user did not own. They had a FAQ especially for this question.</p><blockquote><strong>Can I register projects that I do not own?</strong><br>Yes, you can. You can register projects that you do not own as long as you're at least a contributor to the project and have consent from the project maintainer(s). Registration will only be complete once the PR is merged with the project's repository.</blockquote><p>I started piecing together what was happening here. If you get a pull request merged it seems that is proof enough for Tea to consider trusting the tea constitution file. So sure enough this user was attempting to get a pull request merged to many repositories with themselves listed as the sole owner.</p><p>That would put them in a position to control these tokens (money?) tied to the open source project.</p><p>So I wondered how far this had spread and did a GitHub search.</p><figure><img src="https://connortumbleson.com/content/images/2024/02/tea-abuse.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1586" height="976" srcset="https://connortumbleson.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/tea-abuse.png 600w, https://connortumbleson.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/tea-abuse.png 1000w, https://connortumbleson.com/content/images/2024/02/tea-abuse.png 1586w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>GitHub search for "tea.xyz"</span></figcaption></figure><p>It seemed this was a fresh type of abuse - we had 100+ pull requests in two days all with users trying to add tea configuration files to repositories. Thankfully it seems most of these users are just trying to scam funds and have no actual idea how GitHub works.</p><p>What I mean is these users are just forking projects, merging a fix into their own branch and hoping they've validated that project. Sure enough they've validated their own personal fork - and that is it. It appears only a handful know enough about the process to open the pull request upstream to the main repository.</p><p>So I stumbled upon <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost?ref=connortumbleson.com">TryGhost/Ghost</a> - which is the repository that houses the Ghost software, which is what I use for this blog. I saw many pull requests for this same type of tea file addition:</p><figure><img src="https://connortumbleson.com/content/images/2024/02/tea-merge.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1486" height="884" srcset="https://connortumbleson.com/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/tea-merge.png 600w, https://connortumbleson.com/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/tea-merge.png 1000w, https://connortumbleson.com/content/images/2024/02/tea-merge.png 1486w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>sample of one of the pull requests</span></figcaption></figure><pre><code>https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/pull/19743

<p>Billing and revenue systems are a necessity if you ever plan to monetize your business.</p>



<p>If you’ve spent any time with them, you know that billing systems are <em><strong>complicated</strong></em>, and no one wants to think about them. When they work, it’s great and everyone is happy.</p>



<p>I’ve seen them likened to an octopus, and I fully agree. They touch finance, product, experience, customer support, customers, legal, compliance, sales, and sometimes more.</p>



<figure><a href="https://arnon.dk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image.png"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1019" height="1024" data-attachment-id="1332" data-permalink="https://arnon.dk/the-14-pains-of-billing/image-17/" data-orig-file="https://arnon.dk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image.png" data-orig-size="1125,1131" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://arnon.dk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-298x300.png" data-large-file="https://arnon.dk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-1019x1024.png" src="https://arnon.dk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-1019x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://arnon.dk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-1019x1024.png 1019w, https://arnon.dk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-298x300.png 298w, https://arnon.dk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-150x150.png 150w, https://arnon.dk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-768x772.png 768w, https://arnon.dk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image.png 1125w" sizes="(max-width: 1019px) 100vw, 1019px"></a><figcaption>Billing is hard, intertwined, and complicated.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Because it’s so inter-connected, it can go belly-up rather quickly if something breaks. And stuff does break. <em>Frequently</em>. (If you have a team that’s maintaining this system and it’s not you, ask them!).</p>



<p>Also, if your system isn’t breaking just yet. Give it some time.</p>



<p>Look, I know you are busy running the business and you already have lots on your plate. You just want to collect some money and move on to more pressing features that actually matter to customers.</p>



<p>But remember:</p>



<p>👉 if you can’t collect revenue legally and correctly, it’ll become your headache and you’ll have more on your plate than you could possibly ever chew 👈</p>



<h3>The three patterns</h3>



<p>This is not unique to billing systems. It is very common to see one of three patterns:</p>



<ol>
<li>Home-grown</li>



<li>Full 3rd party system</li>



<li>or a hybrid of a home-grown and 3rd party system</li>
</ol>



<p>These all have their own benefits and drawbacks, naturally.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Build your own / Home-grown</strong></th><th><strong>Hybrid</strong></th><th><strong>3rd party</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>An entirely home-grown solution.<p>The control is hard to beat. Full control, fully customizable, and you aren’t paying anyone from the outside for fees.</p><p>Many think (and this happens to many companies) that building and maintaining your own billing system is the best option for your business.</p></td><td data-align="left">A mix of home-grown solutions and 3rd parties.<p>For example, your billing engine is internal, payments are handled by a PSP, and tax compliance by a tax SaaS.</p><p>Here, you can control the business logic (e.g., when do you update quantities), but the logic is handled by the 3rd parties.</p></td><td>A turnkey solution that handles everything for you.<p>All the business logic, payment processing, invoicing, tax compliance, usage, metering – all done by one full-service solution.</p><p>This is convenient for companies, but you lose a lot of control and may have to shell out a lot of money to get to this place</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>It’s very natural, when you just start your company (or you’re taking your first steps with a new product) to build everything by yourself.</p>



<p>You have engineers. You want to keep it very simple.</p>



<p>Or so you think.</p>



<p>Why not? <strong>Because you’re often still thinking like an engineer.</strong></p>



<p>You’re thinking of billing as an engineering issue. You’ll say to yourself <em>“why can’t we just dump a file of what we need to bill on S3, and have a CRON job pick it up and collect payment?”</em>.</p>



<p>But you’re wrong. It’s a very big and difficult problem, you just aren’t seeing it yet.</p>



<p>Here is my very high-level description of the things a typical billing team needs to worry about (YMMV):</p>

<p>Everyone knows you don’t do your own security (or date handling). You also shouldn’t do your own billing from scratch. </p>

<h3>My 14 pains of billing and monetization</h3>



<p>Allow me to list <em>some</em> of the problems I’ve had with home-grown billing systems, from least complex to most complex (partial list!):</p>



<p>1. <strong>Idempotency</strong>. All requests to do billing, collecting payments need to be unique and idempotent. This will become apparent when you hit API limits and need to retry, or need to spin up more instances of your billing system. Then, you risk double-charging. Luckily crediting/refunding is not a big problem, but this is a problem nonetheless when you scale your infrastructure.</p>



<p>2. <strong>Date handling.</strong> When do you bill? Every 30 days (calendar), or every month (anniversary)? What about leap days, time-zones, etc? </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="679" height="478" data-attachment-id="1336" data-permalink="https://arnon.dk/the-14-pains-of-billing/image-2-7/" data-orig-file="https://arnon.dk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-2.png" data-orig-size="679,478" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-2" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://arnon.dk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-2-300x211.png" data-large-file="https://arnon.dk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-2.png" src="https://arnon.dk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://arnon.dk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-2.png 679w, https://arnon.dk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-2-300x211.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 679px) 100vw, 679px"><figcaption><a href="https://xkcd.com/2867/">via XKCD: 2687</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>3. <strong>Proration and “leftovers”</strong>. Do you prorate on upgrade or only downgrade? Refund? Credits? Ignore it? Block it from happening (don’t allow upgrades/downgrades)?</p>



<p>4. <strong>Usage metering.</strong> There are dozens of way to decide how to calculate usage, <em>and</em> they can be changed frequently or by customer type</p>



<p>5. <strong>Invoice formatting</strong>. Sounds easy if you’re operating in one country. But when you expand you suddenly realise you have to collect not just sales tax, but also sometimes VAT and sometimes GST and sometimes additional levies (country-dependant) and you now need individual templates for each market.</p>



<p>6. <strong>Complex customer hierarchy</strong>. Customers (especially in B2B) could have subsidiaries and partners that they want to manage their billing relationships. How do you roll-up usage up to the paying entity?<br>This is often something that you don’t think about at first, but changes when you grow and expand.</p>



<ul>
<li>Making that even more complex: They could be in different locations, and taxed differently based on their location or where the services are delivered. Then, you are legally required to split the bills/invoices.<br>These rules can also change every few months</li>
</ul>



<p>7. <strong>Payment collection and churn prevention</strong>. When do you give up retrying? How do you handle chargebacks (terminate the account, suspend, refund)?</p>



<p>8. <strong>Pausing/resuming</strong>. What level of access do you let customers have when they pause their subscription?</p>



<p>9. <strong>Crediting / refunding</strong>. If you always refund the entire amount it may not be hard, but what about partial mistakes? Would you maybe want to give a “store credit” instead of a refund? Should that credit ever expire?</p>



<p>10. <strong>Tax handling</strong>. You may think different items having different tax rates is complex enough, but these also change frequently if you’re on the global level.</p>



<p>11. <strong>Custom deals</strong>. If you’re PLG-only this isn’t an issue but if you sign contracts, you will very quickly end up with edge cases and special deals that can’t be easily configured with the assumptions you made.</p>



<p>12. <strong>Human error.</strong> Customers are often comprised of humans who have made mistakes, and corrections need to be made. Businesses too are comprised of humans, who can misconfigure their customers and then need to make corrections. Crediting and reissuing invoices is a very time-consuming task.</p>



<ul>
<li>This is also true when customer’s legal details change (address, VAT ID, etc.)</li>
</ul>



<p>13. <strong>Selective pricing changes</strong>. Pricing changes often don’t affect all customers. When only new customers are affected, you must keep distinct versions of your pricing points to ensure customers’ agreements are kept.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>14. <strong>Revenue recognition and accrued revenue.</strong> I can’t even begin to explain this – but <a href="https://www.ifrs.org/content/dam/ifrs/publications/pdf-standards/english/2021/issued/part-a/ifrs-15-revenue-from-contracts-with-customers.pdf">here’s a 64 page PDF specification of revenue recognition rules according to IFRS-15</a>. If you understand this – you’re special and please e-mail me, I want to know why.<br>Bonus points if you also did a custom <strong>ERP integration</strong> 🥲.</p>



<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>



<h3>Why are these hard?</h3>



<p>Some things change very regularly, more than you’d expect. Some things you only have to do once and never touch again.</p>



<p>Idempotency is a great example of an engineering issue that, once solved, rarely has to be touched.</p>



<p>However, tax rules change regularly across the world. The more countries you’re in, the more tax laws you have to keep track of.</p>



<p>Customer problems around mistakes is a relatively constant issue, but it increases in size as you grow, requiring more customer support and more manual corrections.</p>



<p>Let me try and put it in a table. It’s entirely subjective, but it should help explain the relationship between how frequently things change (== break), and how impacted they are by scale.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Changes frequently</strong> <strong>/ Impacted by scale</strong></td><td><strong>🤏</strong> <strong>Somewhat impacted by your scale</strong></td><td><strong> 📈</strong> <strong>Highly impacted by your scale</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>🪨 Doesn’t change </strong></td><td>* Idempotency<br>* Dates<br>* Pause and resume rules</td><td>* Crediting / refunding<br>* Human errors</td></tr><tr><td><strong>🦥</strong> <strong>Changes sometimes</strong></td><td>* Proration rules<br>* Customer hierarchies</td><td>* Usage calculations<br>* Payment collection<br>* Pricing changes</td></tr><tr><td><strong>🐇</strong> <strong>Changes frequently</strong></td><td>* Custom deals<br>* Revenue Recognition rules</td><td>* Tax handling<br>* Invoice formatting</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption>My subjective assessment of why some topics are more difficult than others</figcaption></figure>



<blockquote>
<p>tl;dr: <strong>Billing is <em>initially </em>an engineering problem rooted in a very very complex problem space which is really hard to understand even for industry veterans.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<h3>What should you do about it?</h3>



<p>Offload as many problems as you can to someone else. Buy something off-the-shelf. Buy as much as you can.</p>



<p>I can’t stress this enough.</p>



<p>Let <a href="https://www.chargebee.com/">Chargebee</a>, <a href="https://www.solvimon.com/">Solvimon</a>, <a href="https://stripe.com/en-dk/billing">Stripe</a>, <a href="https://recurly.com/">Recurly</a>, <a href="https://www.withorb.com/">Orb</a>, <a href="https://metronome.com/">Metronome</a>, <a href="https://www.getlago.com/">Lago</a>, <a href="https://www.togai.com/">Togai</a> or anyone else manage your billing when you start. 90% of the “Subscription and billing” section in the diagram above can be handled by any of these.</p>



<p>Let <a href="https://www.stigg.io/">Stigg</a> handle your pricing pages, experiments, and <a href="https://arnon.dk/why-you-should-separate-your-billing-from-entitlement/">entitlements</a>.</p>



<p>Let your ERP handle your RevRec/Accounting (or use what’s built in with something else). </p>



<p><strong>You should only focus on updating the usage / basic customer lifecycle events, the things that are unique to your product.</strong></p>

I have been tinkering with the vanilla source code of Wolfenstein 3D from 1992. Even though it
is more than 20 years old and has rotten for modern systems, you can still compile it if you recreate the environment.
All you need is :<br>
 </p><ul>
     <li>Wolfenstein 3D source code.</li>
     <li>DosBox.</li>
     <li>The Compiler Borland C++ 3.1.</li>
     <li>Wolfenstein 3D shareware (for the assets).</li>
 </ul>
 
  
 <br>

<br>
<h3>Setup filesystem</h3>
<p>
  Open a command line and create two folders, one for each DOS drive needed:
</p><pre>  
   cd ~
   mkdir system
   cd system
   mkdir c
   mkdir a
   cd ~


 </pre>

<br>
<h3>Download</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>Download Borland 3.1 to <code>system/a</code>.<br>
  </li><li>Download Wolfenstein 3D source code to <code>system/c</code><br>
  </li><li>Download VGA files to <code>system/c</code> (the purpose of those is explained at the bottom of this page.<br>
  </li></ul>

Let's try to compile: Compile -&gt; Build All
    
    <img src="https://fabiensanglard.net/Compile_Like_Its_1992/images/compile_3.png"><br>

    We get an error: "Cannot find executable TASM"
    <img src="https://fabiensanglard.net/Compile_Like_Its_1992/images/compile_4.png"><br>

    Exit Borland C++, we need to set the PATH:

      <pre>
     
     C:\&gt; CD ..
     C:\&gt; PATH=C:\BORLANDC\BIN
     C:\&gt; BC.EXE

<p>
  Go back to DosBox and install the game to <code>C:\WOLF3D</code>.
  </p><pre>
  C:\&gt; c:
  C:\&gt; cd \
  C:\&gt; cd 1wolf14
  C:\1WOLF14&gt; install

  </pre>
  <p>
    After installation of the game, copy the .EXE we just compiled to the game folder, 
  </p><pre>

    C:\&gt; c:
    C:\&gt; cd wolf3d
    C:\WOLF3D&gt; copy WOLF3D.EXE WOLF3D.OLD

<h3>Running the game</h3>
<p>
Try to run it:
</p><pre>

    C:\&gt; cd wolf3d
    C:\WOLF3D&gt; copy WOLF3D.EXE WOLF3D.OLD
    C:\WOLF3D&gt; copy ../WOLRSRC/OBJ/WOLF3D.EXE .
    C:\WOLF3D&gt; WOLF3D.EXE


  </pre>
  <p>
  <br>

  Hm, that looks weird.....
  <br>
<img src="https://fabiensanglard.net/Compile_Like_Its_1992/images/run_wolf.png"><br>
Uh...
<img src="https://fabiensanglard.net/Compile_Like_Its_1992/images/run_wolf2.png"><br>
What ?
<img src="https://fabiensanglard.net/Compile_Like_Its_1992/images/run_wolf3.png"><br>
I did not remember it like that....
<img src="https://fabiensanglard.net/Compile_Like_Its_1992/images/run_wolf4.png"><br>
Ok something must be very wrong here !!<br>
</p>

<br>
<h3>What happened ?</h3>
<p>
It has to do with the production access pipeline and how they are used by the engine. 
When Adrian Carmack and Kevin Cloud were done crafting all the graphic files, they used a tool (IGRABed) to pack them together.
The output was made of 3+2 files.
</p><ul>
   <li>VGAHEAD.WL1</li>
   <li>VGAGRAPH.WL1</li>
   <li>VGADICT.WL1</li>
 </ul>
 <div><p>
  The VGAHEAD file is an index containing pointers to the VGAGRAPH where the data is stored huffman compressed. VGADICT
  contains the huffman dictionaries to decompress the data.</p><p>

The two other files produced:
  </p></div><ul>
    <li>GRE.H</li>
    <li>GRE.EQU</li>
  </ul>
  <div><p>
    Are compiled into engine as seen in the following drawing :</p><!--<img src="images/drawing_plain.svg" width="700px" height="469px" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;"/><br/>
  -->
  <p><img src="https://fabiensanglard.net/Compile_Like_Its_1992/images/drawing_plain.png" width="700px" height="469px"><br>


    What are the <code>.H</code> and <code>.EQU</code> files needed for? In short, to allow access by name. When IGRABed assembled all files
    it would also create an enum with matching indices:</p><p>
    
    <b>GRE.H</b></p></div><pre>
            enum{ 
            H_WOLFLOGOPIC
            GETPSYCHEDPIC
            L_GUYPIC
            .
            .
            } graphicnums

    </pre>
    <p>
    <b>GRE.EQU</b>
 </p><pre>
            
            H_WOLFLOGOPIC  = 0
            GETPSYCHEDPIC  = 1
            L_GUYPIC       = 2

    </pre>
    <div><p>
      This way when the engine requested a particular asset, it could use a logical name (L_GUYPIC) instead of a "magic number" (2).</p><p>
      
      That means the engine shipped with the indices of the images in the VGA files HARD-CODED. Since the assets and
      codebase evolved after shipping wolf3D shareware (with Spears of Destiny), the newly compiled game indices do not
      match the location in the original assets files.

</p></div>
<br>
<h3>Running the game (again)</h3>
<div><p>

  Fortunately there is a simple solution to this problem: Somebody regenerated the VGA assets so they match the indices in the .H and .EQU
  released with the source code. Just copy those files (if you use the shareware assets you will have to change the file extension from .WL6 to .WL1).</p></div><pre>
  C:\&gt; copy C:\vgafiles\VGADICT.WL6 C:\WOLF3D\VGADICT.WL1
  C:\&gt; copy C:\vgafiles\VGAGRAPH.WL6 C:\WOLF3D\VGAGRAPH.WL1
  C:\&gt; copy C:\vgafiles\VGAHEAD.WL6 C:\WOLF3D\VGAHEAD.WL1

</pre>
<p>
    Let's try again:<br>
</p><pre>

  C:\WOLF3D&gt; WOLF3D.EXE
  

</pre>
<div>
  <p>
It works !!

<img src="https://fabiensanglard.net/Compile_Like_Its_1992/images/compressed.png"></p><p>

Yet we are are not done !

</p></div><h3>VGA framebuffer and screen aspect ratio</h3>
<p>
  It may not be obvious to people that never saw the original game but the DosBox image above is not what people saw in 1992.
  The VGA framebuffer was 320x200 but the CRT monitors had an aspect ratio of 4:3. Which mean the framebuffer was stretched vertically
  when sent to the monitor. DosBox has an option to compensate for that :
 <br>
</p><pre>
     vi ~/Library/Preferences/DOSBox\ 0.74\ Preferences
  
    [render]
    # frameskip: How many frames DOSBox skips before drawing one.
    # aspect: Do aspect correction, if your output method doesn't support scaling this can slow things down!.
    # scaler: Scaler used to enlarge/enhance low resolution modes.
      # If 'forced' is appended, then the scaler will be used even if the result might not be desired.
      # Possible values: none, normal2x, normal3x, advmame2x, advmame3x, advinterp2x, advinterp3x, ...

    frameskip=0
    aspect=<b>false</b>
    scaler=normal2x


</pre>
<p>
  Change that aspect to <b>true</b>:
<br>
Try again :<br>

</p><pre>

  C:\WOLF3D&gt; WOLF3D.EXE
  

</pre>

<p><span>In some science fiction cinema, </span>the future looks pretty bleak, with dystopic visions of a world struggling with overcrowding, high crime, pestilence, and the aftermath of war. And it can also look uncomfortably familiar thanks to filmmaker’s use of real-world buildings in their sets — sometimes to anchor the story in real life, and sometimes just because it already looks “futuristic.” We’ve assembled a list of 14 real-world filming locations of&nbsp;sci-fi dystopias.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Blade Runner&nbsp;(1982)<br>Los Angeles, California</strong></p>
<p>This 1982 sci-fi classic was set in a futuristic Los Angeles, and features several landmarks from the genuine article. One of the most notable is the <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/bradbury-building">Bradbury Building</a>, where police officer Rick Deckard&nbsp;(Harrison Ford) fights with a mob of the film’s cyborg “replicants,” and has a final standoff with the replicant Roy Batty&nbsp;(Rutger Hauer).&nbsp;Much of the action takes place in the Bradbury Building’s courtyard, which is open to the public today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Across the street from the Bradbury Building is the Pan Am Building, which stood in for the “Yukon Hotel,” where Deckard catches a replicant early in the film. The police station in which Deckard receives his orders to assassinate all these replicants in the first place was a film set built inside Los Angeles’ cavernous Union Station, a major railway hub.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/8266/image" alt="article-image" width="600" data-kind="article-image"><em>Ennis House (photograph by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jplouis/635408552/in/set-72157600509201984">Jean-Pierre Louis</a>)</em></p>
<p>Deckard’s apartment is in the Ennis House, a complex designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and meant to emulate Mayan temples. The building, which has been turning up in films since the 1930s, is a national landmark and guided tours are available.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Total Recall&nbsp;(1990)</strong><br><strong>Mexico City, Mexico</strong></p>
<p>Originally, Paul Verhoeven wanted to film 1990’s&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Recall_(1990_film)">Total Recall</a>&nbsp;in Houston, but the accountants said no. So Verhoeven moved production south to Churubusco&nbsp;Studios in Mexico City. A handful of other sites in the city were also used, like the penthouse of the Hotel Nikko (now the Hyatt Regency). The crew even&nbsp;stayed at the hotel while filming, and the art directors were so impressed by its streamlined design that they borrowed elements for other scenes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/8261/image" alt="article-image" width="600" data-kind="article-image"><br><em>Hotel Nikko Mexico (photograph by&nbsp;<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3AHotel_Nikko_Mexico_D.F_2011.JPG">Felipe Alfonso Castillo Vázquez</a>)</em></p>
<p>An especially gory scene of <em>Total Recall</em>&nbsp;sees construction worker/secret agent&nbsp;Douglas Quaid&nbsp;(Arnold Schwarzenegger) fleeing from gunmen via an escalator, and using the body of an unfortunate innocent bystander as a human shield. That escalator is in the Metro Chabacano subway station in Mexico City; some visitors claim they&nbsp;can still see leftover blood splatters from filming.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A different metro station — Metro Insurgentes — is also used earlier in the scene for the external shots.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Robocop&nbsp;(1987)<br>Dallas, Texas</strong></p>
<p>Paul Verhoeven did get to film in Texas for an earlier film — set in Detroit. Most of 1987’s <em>Robocop, </em>in which Peter Weller plays Alex Murphy, a recently-deceased Detroit policeman-turned-cyborg-supercop, was actually filmed in Dallas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/8328/image" alt="article-image" width="600" data-kind="article-image"><em><br>Atrium of Plaza of the Americas in downtown Dallas (photograph by <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PlazaAmericas02.jpg">Dfwcre8tive/Wikimedia</a>)</em></p>
<p>The monolithic “Omni Consumer Products” is the sci-fi team responsible for Murphy’s transformation, and three separate locations in Dallas stand in for different spots in the sprawling OCP headquarters. Dallas’ City Hall serves as the building’s exterior — special effects extended the hall to a towering 95 stories. Some interior scenes were shot in the atrium of the Plaza of the Americas — a shopping center&nbsp;which also incorporates Dallas’ Marriott Hotel. A different hotel, the Rosewood Crescent, offered its parking garage as OCP’s garage in the film.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dallas High School on&nbsp;North Pearl Street stands in for the shabby Detroit Police Headquarters, while the interior Detriot PD scenes were filmed in the Sons of Herman Hall. The Sons of Herman Hall was a former German-American social club, which today serves as a music venue.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Logan’s Run&nbsp;(1976)</strong><br><strong>Fort Worth, Texas</strong></p>
<p>Dallas and Fort Worth&nbsp;hosted the&nbsp;1976 dystopian film <em>Logan’s Run</em>. Several scenes were filmed in the Dallas Market Center, a shopping mall standing in for “The City,” an underground complex whose residents believe is the only safe place left on Earth. Another mall, the Hulen Mall in Fort Worth, was just completing construction during filming and was also used for some scenes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/8329/image" alt="article-image" width="600" data-kind="article-image"><br><em>The Water Gardens (photograph by Allison Meier/Atlas Obscura)</em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fort-worth-water-gardens">Fort Worth Water Gardens</a>&nbsp;stand in for The City’s hydro-electric power generator. The Philip Johnson-designed Water Gardens are an unusual architectural attraction, featuring three different concrete pools with fountains and water features. In the “Active Pool,” featured most prominently in the film, visitors can walk down a series of 38 steps to the small reflecting pool at the bottom, while water cascades down the steps and terraces all around them.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Hunger Games (2012/2013)<br>Henry River Mill Village, North Carolina</strong></p>
<p>The <em>Hunger Games</em> trilogy implies that “District 12,” the impoverished coal-mining region which is home to&nbsp;heroine Katniss Everdeen&nbsp;(Jennifer Lawrence), corresponds with Appalachia. Much of the first film was shot in North Carolina, with the abandoned Henry River Mill Village standing in for District 12’s center.</p>

<p>Built in 1904, the whole town was constructed&nbsp;to provide housing for the employees of a major textile mill on the Henry River. The mill ultimately closed in the 1980s, and the town was abandoned.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/8255/image" alt="article-image" width="600" data-kind="article-image"><br><em>Swan House (photograph by<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jamiedfw/6768237113/in/photolist-bj5Z6k-6XjpT3-4BPbz-bj5XmD-6XfqL8-4BNgL-2fxEYJ-2fRKMu-2fxF2j-2fN3tF-2fKDTR-2fKDTn-4BPbx-4BPu1-6XfqmP-6XjpKw-4BNgP-4BNgQ-4BNgM-4BPu2-4BNgN-4BPbw-4iK2LT-4iJZDT-4iP67N"> Jim Bowen</a>)</em></p>
<p>In <em>Catching Fire,</em> the latest entry in the film series, Katniss is one of the guests of honor at a party thrown by the scheming President Snow (Donald Sutherland). President Snow’s estate is actually the Swan House, a mansion built for a 1920s cotton magnate in Buckhead, just north of Atlanta, Georgia. Elsewhere in Atlanta, scenes featuring the Cornucopia — a bunker of supplies which contestants must collect — were filmed at the Beach, a portion of Atlanta’s Clayton County International Park originally constructed for the 1996 Olympics.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/8254/image" alt="article-image" width="600" data-kind="article-image"><br><em>Marriott Marquis elevators (photograph by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/byebyeempire/80889416/in/photolist-a6rYDC-89zB7-djDJYt-6DhEQ-7m69DE-7m2fke-7m67F5-djDKg8-4pZouH-6DWyh">Brian Pennington</a>)</em></p>
<p>Atlanta’s Marriott Marquis Hotel stands in for the victors’ quarters in the Capitol —&nbsp;Panem&nbsp;—&nbsp;and several scenes feature the hotel’s striking interior courtyard and elevator. The hotel was still receiving guests during filming, which lead to an embarrassing moment for actress Jena Malone. A&nbsp;scene required her to walk out of the elevator topless, and during one take the elevator stopped at the wrong floor, giving some guests quite a surprise.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Brazil&nbsp;(1985)</strong><br><strong>UK &amp; France</strong></p>
<p>Filming locations for Terry Gilliam’s 1985 “dystopian satire” <em>Brazil</em> jump between the United Kingdom and Paris.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/8344/image" alt="article-image" width="600" data-kind="article-image"><br><em>Millennium Mills (photograph by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ed_webster/7859933502">Ed Webster</a>)</em></p>
<p>Scenes set at the “Department of Records,” where everyman Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce) works, were filmed at the spooky Millennium Mills in East London, an abandoned flour mill from the early 20th&nbsp;Century.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/8331/image" alt="article-image" width="600" data-kind="article-image"><em><br>Leighton House (photograph by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/europanostra/6964124889">Europa Nostra</a>)</em></p>
<p>In one scene, Lowry’s mother (Katherine Helmond) undergoes a bizarre facelift in a lavish office. Gilliam filmed in the Arab Hall at the Leighton House Museum, the former residence of Victorian-era painter Frederic, Lord Leighton. The Arab Hall is tiled with the ceramics and woodwork Leighton collected on trips to the Middle East. Mrs. Lowry later returns “home” to what once was the Billiard Room of the National Liberal Club, a former clubhouse for members of England’s Liberal Party. The clubhouse has since been taken over by London’s Royal Horseguards Hotel, and the Billiard Room is used for special events.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/8333/image" alt="article-image" width="600" data-kind="article-image"><br><em>Espaces d’Abraxas (photograph by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/83318973@N00/117368888/in/photolist-bnxFw-bnxFx-6RHxpR-62df7V-62hthG">Marcus/Flickr user</a>)</em></p>
<p>Scenes in Lowry’s own home were actually filmed in Paris, chiefly in the Noisy-le-Grand commune. His apartment complex is the Espaces d’Abraxas designed by architect Ricardo Bofill and meant to evoke an ancient Greek amphitheater. Portions of the complex&nbsp;also stand in for “Chapel of Our Lady of the Checkout Counter,” which hosts a funeral scene. At film’s end, Lowry finally escapes his restrictive society — sort of — in the lush fields of Cumbria, in England’s Lake District. The exact scene lies somewhere near the village of Askham. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Gattaca&nbsp;(1997)</strong><br><strong>Marin County, California</strong></p>
<p>Several scenes from <em>Gattaca</em>&nbsp;set at the “Gattaca Corporation,” the DNA testing and eugenics center controlling every person’s destiny, were filmed at the Marin County Civic Center just north of San Francisco.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/8267/image" alt="article-image" width="600" data-kind="article-image"><br><em>Marin County Civic Center (photograph by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dwhartwig/7626464530">Daniel Hartwig</a>)</em></p>
<p>The Civic Center was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, and also appears in another dystopic film — the 1971<em>&nbsp;THX-1138,</em> George Lucas’ very first work.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/8269/image" alt="article-image" width="600" data-kind="article-image"><br><em>Los Angeles City Hall (photograph by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/order_in_chaos/5253595984/in/photolist-91f447-965T43-bR8K2M-8i8YCr-8i93QB-bptbb9-8sf3GU-iLcTJx-iLcWX6-a8vG9r-ef4U1L-8tMPwD-hgtbbW-hDvwe4-gQR95V-kxPFUS-k6zUvP-as3Fhh-mcTDBu-bXF49C-kxPDM5-ayFUpq-aEsXoA-bvKZS8-bvKZS4-bvKZSB-bvKZSi-6AWk1V-ap14wq-aN9yWZ-aN9zh6-aN9z5c-aN9zfg-aN9yP4-aN9zc8-aN9yYV-aN9z2k-aN9z6v-aN9ze2-aN9yHT-aN9z3P-aN9yRF-aN9z8a-aN9yLg-aN9za2-aN9yTP-6a9CrX-6adN3s-6adNYm-6adNJm">Ryan Quick</a>)</em></p>
<p>In another scene, the exterior of the Los Angeles City Hall stands in for a concert hall where Vincent (Ethan Hawke) and Irene (Uma Thurman) have their first date, watching a 12-fingered pianist. Afterward, Vincent takes Irene to watch the sunrise at a “solar farm,” filmed at an actual solar power plant in the Mojave desert.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/8270/image" alt="article-image" width="600" data-kind="article-image"><br><em>Great Western Forum (photograph by &nbsp;<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3AGreatWesternForum.jpg">Horge/Wikimedia</a>)</em></p>
<p>Later in the film, Irene starts to suspect (correctly) that Vincent is lying about who he is, and secretly takes one of his hairs in for DNA testing. The exterior and box office windows of the&nbsp;Great Western&nbsp;Forum are used for the testing facility.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Escape from New York&nbsp;(1981)</strong><br><strong>East St. Louis, Illinois; St. Louis, Missouri; NYC</strong></p>
<p>Despite its name, much of the filming for this 1981 cult classic took place in East St. Louis, Illinois, as director John Carpenter feared it would be too expensive to make the real New York look sufficiently rundown. East St. Louis had&nbsp;plenty of townhouses which resembled New York, and had also recently suffered a major fire, on top of having an abandoned train station and a bridge, two locations the movie required.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/8335/image" alt="article-image" width="600" data-kind="article-image"><em>East St. Louis (photograph by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/binkle76/2463419473">Tyson Blanquart</a>)</em></p>
<p><img src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/8271/image" alt="article-image" width="600" data-kind="article-image"><br><em>Liberty Island (photograph by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/photographerglen/5921527642/in/photolist-a2gnSb-6ZhyWW-dNFWsR-d5qEim-5Dsp4M-6SZCb6-6Xtwe6-98SQY-9rxaeG-apjpgQ-8YjrkP-arTK3L-8NLNyf-5sKXSW-9ziM2t-4PHWrK-aySRLr-4SKecC-7WTv7U-7ZeBef-bHxqiv-7Zajwx-7Zdwpq-7ZfyFf-5E8vnd-5tJgyE-4N5piv-5wLPre-6FXJfc-6JZiWE-7gv4Ub-5oLy5u-ddTPfk-8uriJN-ddd1Fk-bceFjt-aySRxF-4TUxxU-ayVwbQ-ddcZMg-aySSgZ-ayVwas-ayVw7Y-ayVwPE-aySRBz-ayVwVL-aySSdD-ayVwk3-5NSnQF-ak1Rwy">Glen Scarborough</a>)</em></p>
<p>One scene was filmed on location in New York. In the film, Manhattan Island has been turned into a maximum-security prison colony, with the guards stationed on Liberty Island, at the foot of the Statue of Liberty. Carpenter was able to persuade federal officials to let the film use the real Liberty Island for the scene — the first film crew ever given access to the site at night. In the scene, guards receive word that Air Force One has crashed into Manhattan, and the President (Donald Pleasance) is now the hostage of the “The Duke Of New York” (Isaac Hayes).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The exterior of St. Louis’ Fox Theater turns up in an early scene where Snake (Kurt Russell), the anti-hero&nbsp;inmate charged with rescuing the President, first goes looking for him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Chain of Rocks Bridge stands in for New York’s 59<span>th</span>&nbsp;Street Bridge, over which Snake leads the President to ultimate safety. Formerly a bridge on the iconic Route 66, the Old Chain of Rocks Bridge is now closed to vehicular traffic, but hosts biking and pedestrian paths.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Soylent Green (1973)</strong><br><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong></p>
<p>Most of the 1973&nbsp;<em>Soylent Green</em> was filmed in Hollywood sound stages, but two scenes use locations elsewhere in Los Angeles. The exterior of the “euthanasia shop,” where Sol Roth (Edward G. Robinson) goes to subject himself to an assisted suicide, is actually the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/8277/image" alt="article-image" width="600" data-kind="article-image"><em>Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena (photograph by&nbsp;<a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3ALa_sports_arena.jpg">Pelladon/Wikimedia</a>)</em></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Los Angeles’ Hyperion Sewage Treatment Plant was used for the factory in which Robert Thorn (Charlton Heston) discovers what the film’s “Soylent Green” nutritional wafers are <em>really</em> made of. (Spoiler alert: it’s people.)</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/8276/image" alt="article-image" width="600" data-kind="article-image"><em>Hyperion Sewage Treatment Plant (photograph by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/docsearls/8480207669/in/photolist-tw4GN-dVnhi4-dVnhei-dVsStY">Doc Searls</a>)</em></p>
<p><strong>12&nbsp;Monkeys (1995)</strong><br><strong>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Baltimore, Maryland</strong></p>
<p>This 1995 <em>12&nbsp;Monkeys</em>&nbsp;by Terry Gilliam features John Cole (Bruce Willis) in a time-travel paradox, with several filming locations in Philadelphia and Baltimore. Set in the future after a global plague, the first scenes depict Cole collecting air samples outside Philadelphia’s City Hall.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/8279/image" alt="article-image" width="600" data-kind="article-image"><br><em>Philadelphia’s City Hall (photograph by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/draket/6987696291/in/photolist-bDtLEg-4o7qeq-9XBsGE-8p5ME5-8p5Ngh-8p4GLE-8p1uEx-8GnAk3-86Y71s-atJesV-h47uBB-8SegWV-bFA8ca-auHujG-8Sei6B-7nqBh1-aCQPgm-4o7qCS-auHwzy-5f1Dvm-7oXgcX-85XowV-jzXXKt-7sjmGu-4SDot8-85X7zv-7RyLvw-cZamcu-5bmZ4f-cZam6U-9M2YNo-aTpScM-9hJuh2-d6s3a7-7fBACc-545qmj-fM85fW-7WDvuW-7fFuVq-6JXyhj-545qTY-a5BtWF-dsizCW-4aDeEN-9wovq-dsiyVf-dsiB8A-dBfhj4-53dTMb-58sjWg">Ted Drake</a>)</em></p>
<p>Cole is later sent back in time to discover the plague’s origins, where his behavior lands him in an insane asylum, alongside a gloriously demented Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt).

<p>The penitentiary is itself worth a visit. Built in the 1820s, this spoke wheel-shaped prison represents a major reform in the early American penal system. Closed in 1969, the prison is now open for historic tours, where guests can see the former cells of real-life inmates (such as Al Capone) as well as the <em>12&nbsp;Monkeys</em> film sites.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Philadelphia, scenes from Cole’s recurring dream set at an airport were filmed at Philadelphia’s Convention Center. A scene towards the end of the film, where Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) buys disguises for herself and for Cole, were shot at Wanamaker’s Department Store.</p>

<p><strong>The Matrix Trilogy (1999-2003)</strong><br><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong></p>
<p>The virtual-reality city inside “the Matrix” is supposed to be a generic any-place. But much of the trilogy was filmed in and around Sydney, Australia.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.atlasobscura.com/article_images/8283/image" alt="article-image" width="600" data-kind="article-image"><br><em>Metacrotex (photograph by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/acroamatic/286769938/in/photolist-pijHZ-8w2UHk-8w5WZq-rkLHh">Kenneth Pinto</a>)</em></p>
<p>The Metacortex building, where Neo (Keanu Reeves) works as a programmer and first suspects something’s not right with the world, is actually the Metcentre, a shopping mall in Sydney’s Central Business District. The bridge where Neo waits for Trinity (Carrie Ann Moss) to collect him in a car and bring him to meet Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) is the Adam Street Bridge near Sydney’s Chinatown.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sydney shows up in some of Morpheus’ training programs as well. For example, where Neo is distracted by a woman in a red dress at a fountain and then sees her transformed into one of the film’s “agents”&nbsp;is in a&nbsp;plaza near the corners of Martin Place and Pitt Street.</p>

<p>Nearby is&nbsp;the Westin Hotel on the site of the former General Post Office. This is where Neo sees a black cat and has a moment of “déjà vu,” tipping his companions off to an impending attack. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The Colonial State Bank Center is also close by. This is the building where Morpheus is held captive and tortured by agents. The Colonial State may not admit visitors, but you can get into Forty One Restaurant at 2 Chifley Square, where one of Neo’s teammates betrays him to Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) over a steak.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both sequels also feature Sydney; <em>The Matrix Reloaded</em> uses Sydney’s historic White Bay Power Station for the scenes where the rebels attempt to blow up a power station to kill the electricity to a building, and <em>Matrix Revolutions</em> concludes with a meeting between the Oracle and the Architect at the Royal Botanic Gardens on Sydney Harbor.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minority Report&nbsp;(2002)</strong><br><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong></p>
<p>Like <em>Blade Runner,</em> this is based on a Philip K. Dick story and was shot mainly in Los Angeles, despite the story’s Washington, DC setting. A few DC landmarks do make an appearance, however — the exterior of the Ronald Reagan Trade Center is used for the “Department of PreCrime” building where John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is the star detective.&nbsp;The Willard Washington DC Hotel is the site of a splashy party thrown by Anderton’s superiors just before the film’s “PreCrime” system goes national.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Back in Los Angeles, the Descanso Botanic Gardens stand in for the home of Dr. Iris Hineman (Lois Smith), whom Anderton visits when he suspects the PreCrime system has some flaws. Descanso is home to a wide collection of roses, camellias, lilacs, and native California flora on its 160 acres (but none of the sentient poisonous plants which attack Anderton).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The film’s PreCrime system is driven by the visions of three clairvoyant men and women, known as “Precogs.” Anderton kidnaps one, Agatha (Samantha Morton), and brings her to an abandoned shopping mall. The mall is only half abandoned in real life. It’s actually the Hawthorne Plaza Mall, just south of Los Angeles. The entire shopping complex once consisted of an indoor mall with three big-box stores close by, but the mall portion was closed in 1999 after a spate of finance trouble. The three big-box stores are still open, while the mall is now used for a police training center.</p>

<p>Visitors can even also see&nbsp;one of the film&nbsp;sets on a&nbsp;studio backlot. The Warner Brothers VIP Studio Tour includes the street set where Anderton uses a jetpack to escape arrest after being falsely accused of a future murder.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>V for Vendetta (2005)</strong><br><strong>England&nbsp;&amp; Berlin</strong></p>
<p>Alan Moore set his fascist dystopia in London, so the 2005&nbsp;adaptation of <em>V for Vendetta</em> features some obvious landmarks like the Old Bailey courthouse and Big Ben. Much of the film was actually shot on sound stages in Berlin, although&nbsp;a handful of scenes were captured&nbsp;at lesser-known English sites. The film’s prologue, which depicts the story of English antihero Guy Fawkes, sets Fawkes’ execution at Hatfield House, a country house in Hertfordshire.</p>

      <hr>

      
      <p>Try drawing something on the first canvas,
and watch two sets of mechanical alien arms retrace your sketch
(no touch screen support yet):</p>

<p>Once you're done with this introduction to Fourier analysis, you'll be capable of making this (and a lot more) yourself.</p>
<p>The satisfying animation is made possible by the subject of this post - an infinite sum called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series">the Fourier series</a>.
The formula is short, and with some effort, you can memorize it.
However, I implore you to understand where the series comes from, and build deeper intuition for it.</p>
<p>To keep you from clicking off this page,
I'll defer the proof and origin of this equation to the second half,
and thread some interactive animations through the body of this write-up.</p>
<p>Before we get to tracing sketches however, let's brush up some basic math.</p>
<h2 id="adding-functions">Adding functions</h2>
<p>Surely, you're familiar with the addition of numbers, vectors and matrices.
Adding functions is not so different.
The addition of two functions \(f\) and \(g\) at input \(x\) is simply \(f(x) + g(x)\).</p>
<p>Put more formally - \((f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)\).</p>
<p>Let's visualize this by taking an example.
Assume <code>f</code> is \(2sin(x)\) and <code>g</code> is \(cos(2x)\).</p>
<p>Their sum then, can be given by a function: \(h(x) = 2sin(x) + cos(2x)\).</p>
<p>The graph below plots \(f\) and \(g\) in shades of gray, and their sum, \(h\), in red.</p>

<p>Note how in some places, the values of \(f\) and \(g\) are both positive, and their sum is therefore a larger positive number,
while in other places, \(f\) and \(g\) have opposite signs and their values cancel out to a smaller number.</p>
<p>Through the lens of physics, you could look at the two functions as electromagnetic waves, or visible light rays oscillating in the domain of time.
When two such waves overlap with each other in space, they're said to be in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/principle-of-superposition-wave-motion">superposition</a>.
The superposition of two waves results in their sum.</p>
<p>When two points in a wave supplement each other to result in a higher amplitude (the y-value),
their interaction is termed "constructive interference".
When they cancel each other out, it's called "destructive interference".</p>
<p>Go through the last two paragraphs again, and try to digest this idea.
Now, imagine if we had to work our way backwards.
Say we are given a list containing the (x, y) coordinates of all points along the curve of \(h\),
where \(x\) is time and \(y\) is the corresponding output of \(h\) at that point in time.
We have to come up with two simpler periodic functions that sum up to \(h\).</p>
<p>This is exactly what the Fourier series does.</p>
<p>There are several ways to interpret interference in the real world.
If \(f\) and \(g\) were sound waves, their constructive interference would make loud noise, while the destructive interference would produce a quieter sound.
If they were light waves instead, their constructive interference would reveal bright spots on a reflective surface,
and destructive would look like dim patches.</p>
<p>Applications of the Fourier series spill into almost every domain -
signal processing, image compression, shape recognition,
analog transmission, noise cancellation, studying thermodynamic systems
and fitting equations to datasets.</p>
<p>From this wide array of applications, we show our interest in the science of tracing ugly sketches.</p>
<h2 id="decomposing-periodic-functions">Decomposing periodic functions.</h2>
<p>Imagine you had a machine that could scan any food item and display its recipe.
Fourier series does exactly that, except for mathematical functions.</p>
<p>The Fourier series of any periodic function \(f(x)\) with a frequency of \(\omega_0\) is described as:</p>
<p>
   $$
   f(x) = a_0/2 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}b_n sin(n\omega_0x) + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_n cos(n\omega_0x)
   $$
</p>
<p>Meaning that for every periodic function \(f\),
there exists a set of coefficients \(a\) and \(b\),
such that \(f(x)\) can be expressed as an infinite sum of sine and cosine terms of increasing frequencies where the
\(nth\) sine term has a coefficient of \(b_n\) and the \(nth\) cosine term has a coefficient of \(a_n\).
The values of these coefficients are given by the following formulae:</p>
<p>$$
a_n = \int_0^T{f(x)cos(nw_0x)}
$$</p>
<p>$$
b_n = \int_0^T{f(x)sin(nw_0x)}
$$</p>
<p>The interval of integration, \(T\), is the fundamental period of the function.
\(T\) and \(\omega_0\) are related by this equation:</p>
<p>$$
\omega_0 = 2\pi/T
$$</p>
<p>If that was too wordy and made little sense to you, that's okay.
We'll prove this equation later in the post.
Until then, an example will help understand this better.</p>
<p>Consider the square wave - a periodic signal that alternates between 1 and -1 depending on its input.
Formally, it is described like so:</p>
<p>$$
f(t) = 4 \lfloor{t}\rfloor - 2\lfloor2t\rfloor + 1
$$</p>
<p>Here's how it looks when graphed out:</p>

<p>If we use the first few terms from \(f\)'s Fourier series, we can closely approximate the behavior of this function.
In the following graph, the gray curve represents the the square wave and the red curve represents our approximation of it.
You can play with the slider to alter the number of terms we take from the series and see how that changes our approximation.</p>

<p>Clearly, our approximation improves as we take more terms from the series.
The Fourier series can be proven to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_series">converge</a>.
This means that if we take an infinite number of terms from the series, we can get the <em>exact</em> value of \(f(x)\) for any \(x\).</p>
<p>Of course, it is not possible to add up infinite terms in computers.
Instead, we decide upon a fixed number of terms that approximate our function well enough for most practical purposes.</p>
<p>Whenever I say "Fourier series of a function", I mean a series of simple periodic functions that can be added at any given input to approximate the output of the original function at the same input.
For the remainder of this post our goal with Fourier series is to <strong>approximate periodic functions with sums of simpler sine/cosine functions</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="drawing-with-the-fourier-series">Drawing with the Fourier series</h2>
<p>If you wish to understand how the Fourier series works before seeing it in action,
you can skip this section and read ahead to <a href="#proof">the proof</a>, then come back here.</p>
<p>So, How do we go from decomposing time domain functions to recreating sketches?</p>
<p>Imagine you're drawing a sketch on a square sheet of paper.
You are to draw your sketch, start to finish, without lifting the nib of your pen from the paper's surface.
In other words, your sketch must be <em>continuous</em> with no "breaks" in between.</p>
<p>Assume also that the bottom-left corner of the sheet is its origin.
Once you start drawing, I can delineate the position of the pen's tip using a pair of coordinates \((x, y)\) at any given point in time.</p>
<p>Much like a cartesian plane, the \(x\) coordinate represents the horizontal distance from the origin, and \(y\) the vertical.
Both the x and y coordinates change as the pen moves on the sheet's surface.
Meaning, the position of the x-coordinate of your pen's tip can be written as a function of time.
Say you draw this figure:</p>

<p>If we plot the x and y-coordinates independently as functions of time, they'll form curves that look like this:</p>

<p>The blue curve represents the values of x-coordinates of your sketch.
The vertical axis represents the x-value, and the horizontal axis represents time.
Similarly, the red curve plots the y-coordinates.</p>
<p>Both these curves can be viewed as functions of time.
The blue curve represents a function \(x(t)\) that returns the x-position of the pen's tip at time \(t\),
Similarly, the red curve is a function \(y(t)\) which the same for its y-position.
For each of these functions, we can find a Fourier series that approximates it.</p>
<p>Let \(f_x(t)\) and \(f_y(t)\) be the Fourier approximations for \(x(t)\) and \(y(t)\) respectively.
Then recreating the sketch requires computing the values returned by <code>f_t</code> and <code>y_t</code> over a range of values of t.
then pairing them into <code>(x, y)</code> coordinates and connecting the coordinates with lines.
Here is some pseudo-typescript code that mimics this logic:</p>
<p><code><div><pre><code><span id="1"><span>// The "dt" is our time step.</span></span>
<span id="2"><span>// In the real world, a line is an infinitely long series of points.</span></span>
<span id="3"><span>// In computers, we take a "snapshot" of the pen's position</span></span>
<span id="4"><span>// every dt seconds and join these positions with straight lines to</span></span>
<span id="5"><span>// trace the curve. Smaller values of dt require more computation,</span></span>
<span id="6"><span>// and yield better results.</span></span>
<span id="7"><span>const</span> dt <span>=</span> <span>0.01</span><span>;</span></span>
<span id="8"><span>const</span> f_x <span>=</span> <span>fourier_series</span>(x)<span>;</span> <span>// type of x is (t: number) =&gt; number</span></span>
<span id="9"><span>const</span> f_y <span>=</span> <span>fourier_series</span>(y)<span>;</span> <span>// type of y is (t: number) =&gt; number</span></span>
<span id="10"><span>let</span> prev_point <span>=</span> [<span>f_x</span>(<span>0</span>)<span>,</span> <span>f_y</span>(<span>0</span>)]<span>;</span></span>
<span id="11"><span>for</span> (<span>let</span> t <span>=</span> <span>0.01</span><span>;</span> t <span>&lt;</span> <span>1</span><span>;</span> t <span>+=</span> dt) {</span>
<span id="12">  <span>const</span> current_point <span>=</span> [<span>f_x</span>(t)<span>,</span> <span>f_y</span>(t)]<span>;</span></span>
<span id="13">  <span>draw_line</span>(prev_point<span>,</span> current_point)<span>;</span></span>
<span id="14">  prev_point <span>=</span> current_point<span>;</span></span>
<span id="15">}</span></code></pre></div></code></p><p>The approximation generated by this method is shown below.
Just as before, you can play with the slider to adjust the number of terms used in approximation of the sketch.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that <code>f_x</code> and <code>f_y</code> are really just sums of simpler sine/cosine functions, calculated using Fourier's formulae.</p>
<p>You may be wondering - the functions \(x(t)\) and \(y(t)\) aren't periodic, how come we can still decompose them into sine/cosine sums?
One trick is to set the period to infinity, and compute the series at this limit.</p>
<p>In my code, I just set the period to 1 time unit, and assume that the pen just retraces the drawing again and again.
Meaning that \(x(t + 1) = x(0)\).
This makes the math a lot easier, and certainly doesn't make a difference in the outcome.</p>
<p>To be more clear, when the sketch starts, the time is assumed to be 0, and when it ends, the time is assumed to be 1 second.
Every time point in between is scaled accordingly. This is not necessary of course, you could set the time period to however long it took to draw the first sketch, if that makes things simpler for you.</p>
<h2 id="epicycles">Epicycles</h2>
<p>The final caveat are the epicycles.
It is easy to just plot the values returned by \(f_x\) and \(f_y\) on the cartesian plane.
But how do we animate this using revolving circles?</p>
<p>If you've followed the contents of this article so far, you already know how to recreate sketches.
To animate them, you need to understand <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_coordinate_system">The polar coordinate system</a>.</p>
<p>You can read the wikipedia article, or <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/polar-cartesian-coordinates.html">this article</a> to build some intuition for conversion between cartesian and polar coordinates.</p>
<p>In the polar coordinate system, a periodic function with period \(T\) is a vector that rotates around the origin, and completes one full rotation around itself every \(T\) time units.
Look at the graph of \(sin(t)\) in Polar form, for example:</p>

<p>Note how the y-coordinates of the vector's tip traces out a regular sine wave.
You can just as easily plot any periodic function in the polar coordinate system.
To add two periodic functions together, take one rotating vector and center it on the tip of the another rotating vector.
The end result is shown below.
The following animation shows 3 rotating vectors added together, each representing a periodic function:</p>

<p>To convert a sketch to an epicycle animation then, all we need is to convert a term in the Fourier series from cartesian to polar coordinates.
Once we have that, we can add up the terms like in the animation above, and figure out the x and y-coordinates using two sets of epicycles, each representing the Fourier approximation for \(x(t)\) or \(y(t)\).</p>
<p>To do this conversion, we can use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series#Amplitude-phase_form">polar form of the Fourier series</a>.
Precisely, these are the steps you need to follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Represent the sketch as a list of points drawn over a period of time.
</li>
<li>Convert the list of points into a two separate lists, one containing the x-coordinates of the sketch, and other the y.
</li>
<li>Convert each list into a function (I use <a href="https://github.com/srijan-paul/fourier-sketch/blob/eb2be0f646f3097c6725ab621461ba59bfba4b6b/src/math/util.ts#L58">this simple helper</a>).
Now, you have the \(x(t)\) and \(y(t)\).
</li>
<li>For each function, find its Fourier series coefficients. <a href="https://github.com/srijan-paul/fourier-sketch/blob/eb2be0f646f3097c6725ab621461ba59bfba4b6b/src/math/fourier.ts#L16">Here</a> is how I do it.
</li>
<li>For each function, <a href="https://github.com/srijan-paul/fourier-sketch/blob/eb2be0f646f3097c6725ab621461ba59bfba4b6b/src/math/util.ts#L93">convert the Fourier series coefficients into a set of polar functions</a>.
</li>
<li>Using a time step of <code>dt</code>, find the final x and y positions of our approximation, and <a href="https://github.com/srijan-paul/fourier-sketch/blob/eb2be0f646f3097c6725ab621461ba59bfba4b6b/src/components/RedrawCanvas.tsx#L21">draw them on a canvas</a>.
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you do everything correctly, you should get something like this:</p>

<p>There is a more novel approach to retracing sketches that involves using only one set of epicycles.
It uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series#Complex-valued_functions">the complex Fourier Series</a>, and is also fewer lines of code.
When you're new to this concept however, it may throw you off balance, especially if you're not familiar with imaginary numbers and the Argand plane.</p>
<h2 id="proof">Proof</h2>
<p>When I set out to find an "intuitive" proof for the Fourier series,
all I saw were proofs that begin by stating the equation,
and then proving it by finding the coefficients \(a_n\) and \(b_n\) using integrals.
But where did the equation come from?</p>
<p>Did God whisper it to Joseph Fourier in his dreams?</p>
<p>Did he just happen to run into it by chance?</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the answer is "yes".
Of course, he had an unparalleled instinct for math that he whetted with years of practice and research.
There has to be a certain train of thought that he boarded to arrive at this revelation, that any periodic signal can be represented as a sum of simpler harmonics.
But that line of thinking was never publicized, and as you'll see in the next section, there have been people who've thought of this even before Fourier himself did!</p>
<p>The important part is that Fourier asked a question that was mocked as stupid and bizarre until he presented a proof.
And that proof does in fact begin by stating the following hypothesis:</p>
<p>$$
f_o(t) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty{b_nsin(n\omega_0t)}
$$</p>
<p>Here, \(f_o\) is an odd function with a fundamental period of \(w_0\).
If we can derive a value for \(b_n\) from this equation, we can be convinced that <strong>any odd function can be represented as a sum of sinusoids</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, consider an even function \(f_e\) with a period of \(w_0\):</p>
<p>$$
f_e(t) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_n cos(n w_0 t)
$$</p>
<p>If we can derive a value for \(a_n\) from this equation, we can be convinced that <strong>any even function can be represented as a sum of co-sinusoids</strong>.</p>
<p>When you combine these two equations with the idea that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even_and_odd_functions#Even%E2%80%93odd_decomposition">any periodic function can be represented as a sum of odd and an even function</a>, you get:</p>
<p>$$
f_o(t) + f_e(t) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty{b_nsin(n\omega_0t)} + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_n cos(n w_0 t)
$$</p>
<p>We can turn the order of this proof, and first say that given any function \(f(t)\), we can find its odd and even parts using the odd-even decomposition rule.
Then, we can represent the odd part as a sum of sinusoids, and the even part as a sum of co-sinusoids.</p>
<p>Now, all that's left is to derive the values for \(a_n\) and \(b_n\) using the two equations stated above.
This is where I save myself the trouble of writing more LaTeX, and defer you to <a href="http://lpsa.swarthmore.edu/Fourier/Series/DerFS.html">this excellent proof</a> by professors from Swarthmore college.
I know I said I'd walk you through the proof, but I can't do a better job of it than the electronics professors at Swarthmore did already.
I'd hate to repeat their work and not give credit.
If you follow the page I linked, you'll realize that the proof only uses basic calculus and trigonometric identities taught in high school.</p>
<h2 id="origins">Origins</h2>
<p>You'll be surprised to learn that the idea behind the series predates Fourier himself.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss">Carl Friedrich Gauss</a>
was one of the many applied mathematicians who wanted to predict the position of Ceres in the night sky.
To attain this goal, he created several algorithms to aid his study of astronomy.
One of them was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform">Fast Fourier Transform</a> - a function that is very closely related with the Fourier Series.
However, he never published his work because he believed his method to be an unimportant detail in the overall process.</p>
<p>In the 1700s, Euler had found applications for decomposing periodic functions with Fourier Series.</p>
<p>Half a century before Fourier, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Bernoulli">Bernoulli</a> was studying the motion of a string.
He proposed the idea that periodic functions can be represented as sums of harmonics.
Nobody at the time believed this to be a general method, and his ideas were left unexplored.</p>
<p>Things changed in 1807, when a French math wizard named Joseph Fourier found himself studying the heat equation in a metal plate.
In his search for a solution, he sought to ask a seemingly absurd question:</p>
<p><em>Can we represent any periodic function as a sum of simple sine and cosine functions?</em></p>
<p>Precisely, he sought to represent any periodic function \(f(x)\) with a frequency of \(\omega_0\) , in the following form:</p>
<p>
   $$
   f(x) = (a_0 + a_1 cos(\omega_0 t) + a_2 cos(2\omega_0 t) + ... + a_n cos(n\omega_0t)) + (b_1 sin(\omega_0 t) + b_1 sin(2\omega_0 t) + ... + b_n sin(n\omega_0t)
   $$
</p>
<p>Revered mathematicians of the time, including Langrange and Laplace, rejected this idea as informal and hand-wavy.
The panel evaluating his findings said:</p>
<p><em>"The manner in which the author arrives at these equations is not exempt of difficulties and...his analysis to integrate them still leaves something to be desired on the score of generality and even rigour."</em>
Perhaps this was because of a lack of reasoning as to <em>why</em> one should even begin to think of periodic functions this way.</p>
<p>It's not unheard of mathematical ideas to sprout into existence out of seemingly ridiculous places.
Ramanujan attributed some of his major findings to God, and dipped at the age of 32.</p>
<p>After the Fourier Series was accepted by the scientific populace, it spawned a new field of research, called Fourier analysis.
Developments in this field found everyday use in almost every science.</p>
<h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>
<p>By this point, you know enough about Fourier analysis to delve deeper into it yourself.
It would be a shame to blunt the edge of theory by not applying it in practice.</p>
<p>Here a few things you could do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement noise reduction in sounds.
</li>
<li>Sharpen images with denoising.

					<p>The United States has the most expensive transportation infrastructure in the world. That’s because we refuse to learn from experts, other countries, and our own history.</p>
				<div>
											<div><p><strong>Asterisk:</strong><em> The overarching question in your transit policy career has been: Why is America so bad at building transit systems? Earlier this year, your team at NYU released a massive report comparing transit costs in Istanbul, Italy, Sweden and Boston, and then, of course, New York. It culminates in your fantastic case study of the Second Avenue subway line. And that’s where I wanted to start. What went wrong?</em></p><p><strong>Alon Levy:</strong><em> </em>Let’s go back to John Hylan.</p><p>Hylan was a populist mayor between 1918 and 1925. He ran against various corporate interests, which at the time included private streetcar companies. Hylan was hostile to the private operators. This led to bustitution — using buses to undercut the streetcar companies, though even then it was clear that the buses were providing inferior service that cost more to provide.<sup>
    <!-- <a id="fnref-1" href="#fn-1"> -->
    <span id="fnref-1">
        1    </span>
    <!-- </a> -->
</sup>
</p><p>And he was also against the private companies that were running the subway. So the city started building something called the Independent Subway System, commonly known as IND (because the private companies were called IRT, Interborough Rapid Transit). It was built by the city with the express purpose of driving the privates out of business — so the lines were kind of duplicative of the older lines. Only in two places did they truly expand into new places that were not served before. One is the G train, the Crosstown Line between Long Island City and downtown Brooklyn. The other is the Queens Boulevard line.</p><p>It added value. But it was also redundant on purpose — and it culminated in the city buying out the private operators at Depression prices.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A:</strong><em> And what they built also had strong impacts on construction costs that continue today.</em></p><p><strong>AL:</strong><em> </em>Yes. The IND was built to very high standards. These standards meant that, for example, the stations were somewhat farther apart. They had more exits because they were planned around longer trains than the IRT.&nbsp;</p><p>They also decided to build full-length mezzanines, which has since become an American tradition, which everyone tells me is necessary because of the fire code. It is not, in fact, necessary, but it’s a tradition, and telling an American that a tradition is wrong and they should learn, for example, from how Germans build, is not that much different from telling an American that they should ceremonially shred the Constitution and the entire body of American law and adopt the governance standards of Nigeria.</p><p><strong>A:</strong><em> So let’s skip ahead to the 21st century and the Second Avenue subway line. How does this history tie into the high construction costs New York is still seeing for contemporary projects?</em></p><p><strong>AL:</strong><em> </em>As I mentioned, the existing standards in New York were very overbuilt. For example, London started building cut and cover subways in the 1860s and then switched to deep boring —&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A:</strong><em> Cut and cover?</em></p><p><strong>AL:</strong><em> </em>Cut and cover means you cut the street open, put down tracks and then cover them up. With deep boring you use a tunnel boring machine. The tunneling machine goes horizontally, and you don’t disturb the surface except to build stations, which are usually still cut and cover. The merchants will hate you, but after a couple of years of this, they get a station. You can even build the stations from underground, but it’s about 50% more expensive. Generally, cut and cover is superior to deep boring because the stations are closer to the surface, so passengers have less time to travel down to them. It’s also cheaper because you don’t remove as much earth and the stations are easier to build. It does create more surface disturbance. But if you can get away with cut and covering everything, you should cut and cover everything.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A:</strong><em> And the standard set in the 1930s was to use deep boring?</em></p><p><strong>AL:</strong><em> </em>No — into the 1930s the IND used cut and cover, but among their high standards were wider curves, curves that were, in most cases, wider than the turn radius of the streets themselves. And because of that, something had to give. If it was in Brooklyn or in Queens, it didn’t matter very much. But in Manhattan they had to shave corners off of buildings, which meant demolishing buildings in midtown. This made everything much more expensive, and it meant they could not do cut and cover in a way that was cost effective.</p><p>And between that and the fact that cut and cover really is disruptive, the change to deep boring was made — not just the tunnels, which is pretty standard globally, but also the stations at 72nd and 86th Street, which is not standard. This is an example of how you start doing something right, but it’s compromised in a way that makes everything collapse. And as a result, instead of fixing the one bad thing, you replace the paradigm. &nbsp;</p><p>Now, most low-cost places use deep boring, not cut and cover. Cut and cover is cheaper. But if you’re, let’s say, Italy, and you have very low construction costs, you don’t want to deal with the surface disturbance, right? Since surface disturbance scales with income or population density.</p><p><strong>A:</strong><em> And Rome, obviously, is a dense city with a lot of buildings in it.</em></p><p><strong>AL:</strong><em> </em>Yeah. In Rome you can’t do cut and cover because you will cause the collapse of ancient ruins. The parts of the city that are near the classical core are especially expensive because they have to do a lot of deep mining just to protect them. And of course in New York they don’t have to do any of that, but they think that it’s harder.&nbsp;</p><p>The other thing is how to do project delivery. With some variation, in all places with low construction costs and in most places with medium construction costs, the state does planning. They can contract consultants to help, but the state supervises them. The state owns the design. You almost always do two contracts, one for design and one for construction. It’s called, in American terminology, “Design-Bid-Build.”&nbsp;</p></div>

</div>
											<div><p><strong>A:</strong><em> So there’s two different sets of contractors involved here</em> — <em>one group that does the design process, one group that actually builds it.</em></p><p><strong>AL:</strong><em> </em>Yeah. Exactly.</p><p><strong>A:</strong><em> Okay. And then the alternative is Design-Build</em> — <em>where it’s the same people building who are designing.</em></p><p><strong>AL:</strong><em> </em>Right. There’s a belief that Design-Build is more modern and more advanced. But every time a place switches from Design-Bid-Build to Design-Build, their construction costs go up, which is usually taken as evidence that that place is uniquely difficult to build in.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, the right way to do Design-Bid-Build requires a bunch of elements that are not present in the United States. Some of them have never been present. Some of them have atrophied. The first element, that’s the one that used to be present but isn’t anymore, is a large public sector, because you need a large enough bureaucracy that can supervise all the contractors.</p><p><strong>A:</strong><em> I want to zoom in on this point a bit, because it’s not like the U.S. doesn’t have a large public service bureaucracy. But reading your report, it seems like the bureaucracy just doesn’t have the institutional knowledge that it needs to build cost-effectively. One line that hit me over the head was how some of the contractors had worked on projects in D.C. and Boston, but no one had immediate experience managing a project like Second Avenue. These are the people whose job it is to build transit in New York! How do they not have experience building transit in New York?</em></p><p><strong>AL:</strong><em> </em>I mean, New York hadn’t built in a while. And they’re New Yorkers. Do you think they’re really going to try to learn from a village like D.C. or Boston or Paris? It’s actually kind of striking, who learns from whom on this? One of the things that we figured out while doing the database is —&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A:</strong><em> The database, just to clarify for readers —</em></p><p><strong>AL:</strong><em> </em>The database shows the construction costs of, I’m guessing, 80 to 90% of the world’s subways by route length, with construction costs inflated to 2021 dollars. This required getting information in a bunch of different languages. One of our contractors is Arab-Israeli. And so he added a lot of Arab world data for us. And one of the things that he pointed out to us was that it was difficult for him to get information <br>out of Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco because a lot of the work there is done in French. These three countries specifically use French so much that they kind of try to be France. I mean, they’re very proud of their culture. They’re proud of anticolonialism, but they do imitate France in many ways.</p><p><strong>A:</strong><em> This is another interesting point</em> — <em>and I do want to get back to American civil service bureaucracy</em> — <em>but you have written about how former colonies tend to copy transit practices from the metropole.</em></p><p><strong>AL:</strong><em> </em>In Asia a lot of countries are trying to copy Japan, and they’re copying Japan in a very turnkey style. They use methods that require a lot of expensive capital and not a lot of cheap labor, because in Japan, capital is cheap and labor is expensive. It’s very visible in Indian construction costs. The stuff they do domestically, like their electrification project — you know, Indian railways are about to complete electrifying the entire country, right?</p><p><strong>A:</strong><em> Yes.</em></p><p><strong>AL:</strong><em> </em>Yeah, the construction costs for that are rather low, maybe $750,000 per route kilometer, and the Euro norm is probably about $2.5 million. So in India it’s maybe one-third as expensive. And then you look at mega-projects like metros of high-speed rail that those countries outsource to Japanese designers or that they learn from Japanese designers, and their construction costs are rather high. Often, the learning is toxic. That is to say, you learn from the wrong people or you learn from people who are the right people, but not for your circumstance. That’s absolutely a problem.</p><p><strong>A:</strong><em> So even though Japan has built efficiently for Japan, the methods that are efficient in Japan are not methods that are efficient in India.</em></p><p><strong>AL:</strong><em> </em>Exactly. This is a problem throughout the Third World. Now, bear <br>in mind that construction costs per kilometer and country GDP per capita are positively correlated, but that’s entirely because poor countries tend to build more elevated and inferior underground lines, which are cheaper. If you strip that away, the correlation, I think, was very low — 0.04. So that’s fascinating.</p><p><strong>A:</strong><em> You’d expect it to be cheaper because labor costs should be lower.</em></p><p><strong>AL:</strong><em> </em>Right. But labor is not a large proportion of cost. Labor in most places is 25% of the cost.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A:</strong><em> But not in the U.S.?</em></p><p><strong>AL:</strong><em> </em>Yes, in the U.S., just not in the northeast. Labor issues are northeast specific. They don’t even exist in California.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A:</strong><em> So bringing us back to Second Avenue —&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>AL:</strong><em> </em>Yeah. So let’s pop the stack. In New York, they do have an in-house bureaucracy, but it’s atrophied. So what do we mean by “it’s atrophied”? First of all, the United States has, over the generations, developed a parallel civil service, which is an overclass of political appointees. The number that’s stuck in my head is 13,000 state level direct. For example, the head of the MTA is a political appointment of the governor.</p><p><strong>A:</strong><em> Does that mean there are 13,000 political appointees in transit?</em></p><p><strong>AL:</strong><em> </em>No, 13,000 people in the United States work for a state government who are appointed by the governor or lower-level official. The governor may choose to appoint a technocrat, but it’s not expected. And then there’s also the indirect people, the people who these appointees hire as their personal staff. When these people walk into the room, the experienced civil servants lower their heads a little bit. When you tell the civil service that it’s always going to be on the lower end of the class system, you’re going to lose the best people. The best people will pick a career path that lets them be on top, which in this system means they’re doing many different things and never learn one thing well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A:</strong><em> Spain and Italy are low-cost countries, right? And when I think of innovative, disruptive organizations, I don’t think of Italian bureaucrats.&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>AL:</strong><em> </em>Right. Because the social innovations that you see in low-cost countries are really difficult to export.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A:</strong><em> What features of these bureaucracies make them more effective? What really works in Italy or Turkey or Spain?</em></p><p><strong>AL:</strong><em> </em>Good question. I started complaining about American badness with things like the class system. So let’s look at the mirror image. Southern European bureaucracy is one where, first of all, they all have cultures of respect for engineers. The idea that a public policy grad from Harvard or Oxford gets to tell a scientist what to do — that’s a very American and British thing. In Germany, forget about it. In Italy, forget about it. The same with Spain and Portugal. And this is also carried over to Latin America — not all of which has low construction costs. Brazil kind of sucks at this, but there’s still a culture in which the engineers get a lot of respect. I hear this from students: “Oh yeah, the engineers get the nicest buildings.” The engineer can rise to the top.&nbsp;</p></div>

											<div><p><strong>A:</strong><em> This lack of effective leadership from the public sector comes up over and over again in your discussions of American transit, both internally and in their relationships with other actors. They struggle at cooperating with other agencies</em> — <em>with the Department of Transportation, with the Department of Environmental Protection, with parks, with buildings, with the fire department. And they’re also quite inefficient at managing consultants because they don’t have enough technical in-house knowledge to really understand how to.</em></p><p><strong>AL:</strong><em> </em>Exactly. So then they’ll hire a consultant to manage the consultants — it’s the most ridiculous thing.</p><p><strong>A:</strong><em> They don’t really know what asks to make of other actors. So, as an example of communication issues, the interfacing with public utilities just blew my mind. In New York, nobody knows where utilities are in the street, where an electric line is or a sewage line is. They’re constantly renegotiating to get them moved or get them integrated. In these low-cost countries we’ve been talking about, the transit agencies themselves are more centralized. So instead of having New York City Transit versus the Metropolitan Transit Authority versus, I don’t know, a state agency, there is one central agency that does planning. And obviously this makes things more streamlined internally, but they also seem to handle integration with other non-transit agencies better. And I’m curious how they manage that.</em></p><p><strong>AL:</strong><em> </em>Okay. So first of all, the MTA is actually rather integrated, and the same is true of the MBTA in Boston and SEPTA in Philadelphia.</p><p>However, there’s also an American tradition, which is very difficult to question, that commuter rail is separate. There was this former head of the MBTA, Frank DePaola, I think this was very recently in 2016, who said that commuter rail is not mass transit, it’s its own thing. And so there’s no cooperation. This means that, for example, East Side Access did not have any coordination between the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North.&nbsp;</p><p>And again, they won’t learn because the U.S. finds it difficult to learn from others, especially if they don’t speak English, especially if they’re not Canada. We see this also with Design-Bid-Build versus Design-Build. To make them work, you need a large in-house bureaucracy. You can just pretend Design-Build works if you don’t have one, because the consultants will do everything. And then when they submit a large bill, they say, “Oh, it’s just hard to build here. It’s because we’re so rich.” But New Zealand and Ireland, which are not especially rich, have British construction costs. But again, you also need to have flexibility. You need to make sure that the builders can be flexible and do variations from design. They’re good at it in Turkey.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A:</strong><em> This idea of flexibility is also interesting to me, because when you look at these projects, one of the major drivers of increased costs is that something always needs to be redesigned mid-project</em> — <em>a neighbor objects to something about the station or there’s a utility hookup that needs to be changed, and that always adds cost. It seems like American transit agencies are really bad at predicting cost overruns. You’d think that given that this seems to happen every time they’re doing an initial estimate, some of that would be priced in.</em></p><p><strong>AL:</strong><em> </em>This isn’t just an American thing. There’s no difference between cost overruns in the U.S. and Europe.</p><p><strong>A:</strong><em> So the U.S. is just worse on base costs, not overruns?</em></p><p><strong>AL:</strong><em> </em>Yeah, exactly. So actually the U.S. figured out that they had a cost overrun problem in the ’80s. What they started doing is acquiring contingencies. And the problem with contingencies is that the money will pretty much always be spent. A contingency is when — let’s say a project is going to cost $150 million. So instead of saying it’s $150, you say it’s $200 so that when the cost inevitably rises, you can say you went below budget. And this has been pretty deleterious because if you’re optimizing for cost overruns, you will just say that the costs are higher. You will include several layers of contingency. The Federal Transit Administration requires some ridiculously large numbers, I think almost 40%.</p><p><strong>A:</strong><em> So once you’ve said that your budget is $300 million, even if you only expect it to be $200 million, the money will get spent.&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>AL:</strong><em> </em>I mean, a local neighborhood says they want a signature station, a station with art, where the artist got paid a couple hundred thousand dollars for the entire installation. Or they want to make a space very big, so they need to move the escalators and much more electrical wiring. It’s things like that: the special bespoke designs that don’t actually make the station nicer. Second Avenue Subway had, I think, two different escalator contractors.</p><p><strong>A:</strong><em> Another recurring theme. Every local actor that could be involved in this process has an ask, and it seems like a lot of the skill of managing a transit project is being able to have the requisite engineering knowledge and also the political skill to fend off all of the different requests the different agencies and municipalities and individuals will be making of you.</em></p><p><strong>AL:</strong><em> </em>Yeah, exactly. One of the issues is that if the civil service says, “Oh, these are our designs; they meet the fire code,” and a fire department official says, “No, they don’t,” the civil service is not going to back their own designers.<em>&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>A:</strong><em> I’m from Los Angeles, and mostly in the 1950s, L.A. standardized plans for schools across the city. And then they just built them a bunch of times, and they’re beautiful buildings and much cheaper than designing from scratch every time, which is what happens now.</em></p><p><strong>AL:</strong><em> </em>That’s the right way to do it. Just build the same thing, and if you need to customize, art does not cost a lot of money. But instead of doing that or painting the bare tunnels like in Stockholm, they have way too many people in the room. These people are typically nongovernmental actors, or from a local government. But I don’t want to make this entirely about federalism because Canada is federal but has a much stronger provincial government than the American state government. Canada has almost the same construction costs as the United States. They kind of imported the American parallel party state, where they’re going to politicize engineering decisions. In New York it’s essentially the same problem. By the way, Italy and Greece both have a lot of clientelism but enough engineering procedure that it doesn’t hit the engineers. Spain and Portugal have much less clientelism than Italy and Greece. Spain and Portugal also have lower construction costs.</p></div>

</div>
											<div><p><strong>A:</strong><em> When you talk about clientelism, is that separate from appointments being politicized?&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>AL:</strong> Clientelism and political appointments usually come from different traditions, but they’re very similar. Clientelism is when people vote for a party with the expectation that they will get jobs that way. In the United States, before the civil service system, they had the spoils system, where if you wanted to literally be the person digging things to build a road, you needed to be a member of the party that won the election. And so a lot of American civil service dysfunction is people being too rigid because they passed these laws in the 1900s and 1910s and didn’t update them correctly. Instead of, say, letting construction contractors make changes, they always keep the risk in the public sector. The thinking is that if the risk is privatized, the private concessionaire will just raise the prices. Because they assume the civil service means a set of federal regulations for the first third of the 20th century, the errors keep accumulating. Whereas a place like Southern Europe can build.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A:</strong><em> This complicates the idea of corruption, because I do think of Italy as being more corrupt than the U.S.</em></p><p><strong>AL:</strong><em> </em>Oh yeah. Italy and corruption, it’s like America and racism. Italians are aware of their reputation for corruption. In the ’90s, the entire political system was upended in a series of highly mediagenic prosecutions by nonpolitical prosecutors, who at one point put half of the Italian parliament under indictment. They also passed a lot of anticorruption rules. Italian construction costs in the 1970s were not especially low. They were the same as Britain, same as Germany. They’ve fallen since the ’90s because they cracked down on corruption. There are a lot of remaining corruption issues in Italy, but they’re not about that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A:</strong><em> This ties back to something you were saying earlier</em> — <em>there’s learning from people who are doing things right, and then there’s learning the right lessons from your context. Italy’s problem was corruption, and they’ve taken steps to fix it. You talk a lot about the U.S. being resistant to learning from countries in Europe and Asia with low construction costs. But what are the lessons that the U.S. should be learning that are appropriate for our context?</em></p><p><strong>AL:</strong><em> </em>Good question. First of all, I’m going to start with very abstract things before I concretize. Don’t fixate on small differences within the core. Instead, pay attention to things that the core has in common.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A:</strong><em> Which countries are the core in transit?</em></p><p><strong>AL:</strong><em> </em>Construction and operations are different. For example, Britain is good at operations, at least in London. It’s terrible at construction. In construction the best are Spain and Portugal, and I think also Turkey. Southern Europe in general is good. The Nordic countries used to be excellent. They no longer are. They’ve anglicised a little too much. Germany is decent. France is decent. Parts of Latin America are very good.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A:</strong><em> Okay.</em></p><p><strong>AL:</strong><em> </em>So the narrow point is, try to learn from as many different places as possible and see what the commonalities are, not the differences. This is where you can talk about the civil service. Scandinavia has a culture of respect for the civil service. The same is true of Germany. The same is true of France, though it’s somewhat more classist. The same is true of Southern Europe, with engineers especially. So you definitely want that. I don’t know enough about Korea to tell you whether that’s how it differs from Taiwan. Taiwan has very high construction costs.&nbsp;</p><p>So first of all, the public sector needs to be empowered to make planning decisions. Again, you can outsource the design to consultants, but the consultants need to be supervised by civil servants, not political appointees and not other consultants. The most complex and the most sensitive projects are the ones that require the most public supervision, not the least. Another place we see this issue in the U.S. is with which contractor to pick. In the United States there is a legal framework for what’s called lowest responsible bid, which means the civil service is required to pick the lowest bid. Usually they can reject a bid if it’s unrealistic. But, for example, in California, they can’t even do that.</p><p>The correct way to do it is have the in-house engineers score every proposal technically for how good it looks to them, and then hire based on a combination of the technical score and the price. In California, they erred by having too little weight on the technical score, only 30%. The norm in the European low- and medium-cost countries that we have seen is that the technical score ranges from 50 to 70%. But this means you need to have an in-house bureaucracy that can technically score things. Another thing low-cost countries do is publicly itemize costs so that whenever you have disputes over changes, they’re prepriced. If someone says, say, “We’ve had a six month delay, and the prices of the concrete walls are higher than we expect because the prices of concrete have risen,” it’s priced in. It means that you want to constantly deprivatize risk as much as possible, because the state can bear the risk much more than a private contractor.</p><p><strong>A:</strong><em> In other words, the more risk that contractors are asked to take on, the more they’ll charge. And this adds up.</em></p><p><strong>AL</strong><em>: </em>Exactly. And this means that the state needs to be less hardline about changes. Again, the changes should be priced in.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A:</strong><em> These places that have good civil service bureaucracies didn’t always. So how did they build them?&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>AL:</strong><em> </em>First of all, you stop running against it. You stop calling them a deep state. At this point in the United States, it often happens to the parallel party governance. So Beto O’Rourke in the 2018 Senate race went to, I forget which college, maybe UT Austin, but a very left-leaning electorate to try to get out the vote. And he said the consultants would never let us go to a college. We go here because we didn’t hire any. Now, Beto, like every other American political candidate of note, hires consultants. He hires from the same pool of consultants as everyone else in the Democratic Party. But he runs against his own consultants doing something that is completely anodyne. He’s not an especially populist politician. He’s not an especially outsider politician. And even he ran against his own consultants. Politicians do it all the time, and it cascades downward. The political appointees do not trust the civil service because the civil service is constantly told that they’re not allowed to talk back. Do you think the head of the MTA knows which civil servants to fire? He doesn’t know the difference between them.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A:</strong><em> And is there anything else concrete that you think the U.S. could implement that would help improve that culture?</em></p><p><strong>AL:</strong><em> </em>Get leaders who don’t talk to the civil service like a king talks to his servants. Andy Byford, head of the New York City Transit Authority from 2017 to 2020, was a political appointee in the sense that his appointment was a political decision by Andrew Cuomo. But he was an outsider to the United States, and he had experience as a professional in the industry his entire life.&nbsp;</p><p>The United States needs to start understanding that you guys are behind countries that you guys look down on. Turkey is the biggest example, not even Italy. Learn from the right places. It’s not like the United States does not have a civil service, okay? It’s not Uganda. There are a lot of people who are, let’s say, my age, give or take a couple years, who have very good ideas. They’re just not being listened to. Stop trying to polarize against the civil service. Hire people who are not generalists or political appointees. If you need to hire an outsider, hire an outsider.&nbsp;</p><p>And over time, I think it would succeed and create a tradition where you have to hire someone who’s a professional because all the successes will come from that. Byford is considered to have been a success in New York, and he became a superstar as a result. But if there are many like him in various parts of the United States, people will notice.&nbsp;</p></div>

  <figcaption>The view from Cupertino.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The DMA requires Apple to open the iPhone to competing app stores, and and its lopsided proposal for "enabling" them is <a href="https://on.ft.com/3wsiYZd">getting most of the press.</a> But Apple knows it has native stores right where it wants them. Cupertino's <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050696/epic-games-tim-sweeney-apple-app-store-response">noxious requirements</a> will take years to litigate. Meanwhile, potential competitors are only that.</p>
<p>But Cupertino can't delay the DMA's other mandate: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050478/apple-ios-17-4-browser-engines-eu">real browsers,</a> downloaded from Apple's own app store. Since it can't keep them from emerging, it's trying to raise costs on competitors and lower their potential to disrupt Apple's cozy monopoly. How? By geofencing browser choice and kneecapping web apps, all while gaslighting users about who is breaking their web apps.</p>
<p>The immediate impact of iOS 17.4 in the EU will be broken apps and lost data, affecting schools, governments, startups, gamers, and anyone else with the temerity to look outside the one true app store for even a second.</p>
<p>The data loss will be catastrophic for many, as will the removal of foundational features like <a href="https://web.dev/articles/storage-for-the-web">reliable data storage,</a> <a href="https://web.dev/learn/pwa/app-design">app-like UI,</a> settings integration, <a href="https://web.dev/explore/notifications">Push Notifications,</a> and <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/capabilities/web-apis/badging-api">unread counts</a>. This will <em>just so happen</em> to render PWAs useless to worldwide businesses looking to reach EU users. A <em>regrettable</em> accident, to be sure.</p>
<p>Apple's interpretation of the DMA <em>appears</em> to be that features not available on March 6th don't need to be shared with competitors, and it doesn't want to share web apps. The solution almost writes itself: sabotage PWAs ahead of the deadline and give affected users, businesses, and competitors minimal time to react.</p>
<p>Cupertino's not just trying to vandalise PWAs and critical re-engagement features for Safari; it's working to prevent <em>any</em> browser from <em>ever</em> offering them on iOS. If Apple succeeds in the next two weeks, it will cement a future in which the mobile web will never be permitted to grow beyond marketing pages for native apps.</p>
<p>By hook or by crook, Apple's going to maintain its home screen advantage.</p>
<p>The business goal is obvious: force firms back into the app store Apple taxes and out of the only ecosystem it can't — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/26/23933206/google-apple-search-deal-safari-18-billion">at least not directly.</a> Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu#8">justifications range from unfalsifiable smokescreens to blatant lies,</a> but to know it you have to have a background in browser engineering and the <a href="https://eur-lex.auropa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32022R1925&amp;qid=1708824200885">DMA's legalese.</a> The rest of this post will provide that context. Apologies in advance for the length.</p>
<p>If you'd like to stop reading here, take with you the knowledge that Cupertino's attempt to scuttle PWAs under cover of chaos is exactly what it appears to be: a shocking attempt to keep the web from <em>ever</em> emerging as a true threat to the App Store and <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/16/apple_web_apps/">blame regulators for Apple's own malicious choices.</a></p>
<p>And they just might get away with it if we don't all <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/apple-attempts-killing-webapps/">get involved ASAP.</a></p>

<p>Two weeks ago, Apple sprung its <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/developers-revolt-apple-dma/">EU Digital Markets Act (DMA) compliance plans on the world as a <em>fait accomplis</em>.</a></p>
<p>The last-minute unveil and months of radio silence were calculated to give competitors minimal time to react to the complex terms, conditions, and APIs. This tactic tries to set Apple's proposal as a negotiating baseline, forcing competitors to burn time and money arguing down plainly unacceptable terms before they can enter the market.</p>
<p>For native app store hopefuls, this means years of expensive disputes before they can begin to access an already geofenced market.

  <figcaption>Apple's message of hope and optimism for a better web.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The proposals are maximally onerous, but you don't have to take my word for it; here's Mozilla:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are ... extremely disappointed with Apple’s proposed plan to restrict the newly-announced BrowserEngineKit to EU-specific apps. The effect of this would be to force an independent browser like Firefox to build and maintain two separate browser implementations — a burden Apple themselves will not have to bear.</p>
<p>Apple’s proposals fail to give consumers viable choices by making it as painful as possible for others to provide competitive alternatives to Safari.</p>
<p>This is another example of Apple creating barriers to prevent true browser competition on iOS.</p>
<p>— <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/26/24052067/mozilla-apple-ios-browser-rules-firefox">Mozilla spokesperson</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The obvious strategy is to raise costs and lower the value of porting browsers to iOS. Other browser vendors have cited exactly these concerns when asked about plans to bring their best products to iOS. Apple's play is to engineer an unusable alternative then cite the lack of adoption to <em>other</em> regulators as proof that mandating real engine choice is unwise.</p>
<p>Instead of facilitating worldwide browser choice in good faith, Apple's working to geofence progress; classic "divide and conquer" stuff, justified with <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/05/27/safari_webkit_bug/">serially falsified security excuses.</a> Odious, brazen, and likely in violation of the DMA, but to the extent that it will now turn into a legal dispute, that's a feature (not a bug) from Apple's perspective.</p>
<p>When you're the monopolist, delay is winning.</p>
<h2 id="but-wait!-there's-more!">But Wait! There's More! <a href="#but-wait!-there's-more!">#</a></h2>
<p>All of this would be stock <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/02/home-screen-advantage/2022/06/apple-is-not-defending-browser-engine-choice/#apple's-long-standing-policies-are-anti-diversity">FruitCo doing anti-competitive FruitCo things,</a> but they went further, <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/did-apple-just-break-web-apps-in-ios17.4-beta-eu/">attempting to silently shiv PWAs and blame regulators for it.</a> And they did it in the dead of the night, silently disabling important features as close to the DMA compliance deadline as possible.</p>
<p>It's challenging, verging on impossible, to read this as anything but <em>extrordinary</em> bad faith, but Apple's tactics require context to understand. The <a href="https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/about-dma_en#:~:text=The%20DMA%20entered%20into%20force,and%20provide%20all%20relevant%20information.">DMA came into force in 2022,</a> putting everyone (including Apple) on notice that their biggest platforms and products would probably be "designated", and after designation, they would have six months to "comply". The first set of designation decisions <a href="https://theplatformlaw.blog/2023/09/06/european-commission-adopts-first-dma-designation-decisions/">went out last Sept</a>, obligating Android, Windows, iOS, Chrome, and Safari to comply <em>no later</em> than March 6th, 2024.</p>

</figure>
<p>A maximally aggressive legal interpretation might try to exploit ambiguity in what it means to comply and when responsibilities <em>actually</em> attach.</p>
<p>Does compliance mean providing open and fair access starting from when iOS and Safari were <em>designated</em>, or does compliance obligation only attach six months later? The DMA's text is not ironclad here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>10: The gatekeeper shall comply with the obligations laid down in Articles 5, 6 and 7 within 6 months after a core platform service has been listed in the designation decision pursuant to paragraph 9 of this Article.</p>
<p><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32022R1925&amp;qid=1708824200885#003.010">DMA Article 3, Clause 10</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Firms looking to comply maliciously <em>might</em> try to remove troublesome features <em>just</em> before a compliance deadline, then argue they don't need to share them with competitors becuse they weren't available before the deadline set in. Apple looks set to argue, contra everyone else subject to the DMA, that the moment from which features must be made interoperable is the end of the fair-warning period, not the date of designation.</p>
<p>This appears to be Apple's play, and it stinks to high heavens.</p>
<h3 id="what's-at-risk%3F">What's At Risk? <a href="#what's-at-risk%3F">#</a></h3>
<p>Apple's change isn't merely cosmetic. In addition to immediate data loss, FruitCo's change will destroy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>App-like UI:</strong><br>Web apps are no longer going to look or work like apps in the task manager, systems settings, or any other surface. Homescreen web apps will be demoted to tabs in the default browser.</li>
<li><strong>Reliable storage:</strong><br>PWAs were the only exemption to Apple's (frankly silly) <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_API/Storage_quotas_and_eviction_criteria#proactive_eviction">seven day storage eviction policy,</a> meaning the last safe harbour for anyone trying to build a serious, offline-first experience just had the rug pulled out from under them.</li>
<li><strong>Push Notifications:</strong><br>Remember how Apple gaslit web developers over Web Push for the best part of a decade? And remember how, when they finally got around to it, <a href="https://webventures.rejh.nl/blog/2024/web-push-ios-one-year/">they did a comically inept job of it?</a> And recall all the fretting and worry about how shite your Push Notifications look and work for iOS users as a result? Well, rest easy, because they're going away and you won't have to worry your pretty little head any more.</li>
<li><strong>App Icon Badging:</strong><br>A kissing cousin of Push, Icon Badging allows PWAs to ambiently notify users of new messages, something iOS native apps have been able to do for nearly 15 years.</li>
</ul>
  <!-- - **Minimally-functional Fullscreen:**<br>Games, in particular, need to maximize phone real estate. Apple hasn't gone off its hobby of gaslighting webdevs. In addition to 8 years of Push Notification excuses, Safari's totally broken [Fullscreen API,](TODO) meant PWAs were the best (if not only) way to get a working UI surface for presenting a `<canvas>` that wouldn't be dismissed at the slightest misgesture. -->
<p>Removal of one would be a crisis. Together? Apple's engineering the PWApocalypse.</p>
<p>You can't build credible mobile experiences without these features. A social network without notifications? A notetaking app that randomly loses data? Businesses will get the message worldwide: if you want to be on the homescreen and deliver services that aren't foundationally compromised, the only game in town is Apple's app store.</p>
<p>Apple understands even the most aggressive legal theories about DMA timing wouldn't support kneecapping PWAs <em>after</em> March 6th. Even if you believe (as I do) their obligations attached back in September, there's at least an argument to be tested. Cupertino's white-shoe litigators would be laughed out of court and <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_20_2349#:~:text=In%20case%20a,systemic%20non%2Dcompliance.">Apple would get fined ridiculous amounts</a> for non-compliance after trying to deny these features to other browsers after the end of the fair-warning period. To preserve the argument for litigation, it was necessary to do the dirty deed ahead of the last plausible deadline.</p>
<h3 id="not-with-a-bang%2C-but-with-a-beta">Not With A Bang, But With A Beta <a href="#not-with-a-bang%2C-but-with-a-beta">#</a></h3>
<p>The first indication something was amiss was a conspicuous lack of APIs for PWA support in the documentation for obviously long-baking <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/browserenginekit"><code>BrowserEngineKit</code></a>, released on Feb 1st alongside Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/01/apple-announces-changes-to-ios-safari-and-the-app-store-in-the-european-union/">peevish, deeply misleading note</a> that attempted to whitewash malicious compliance in a thin coat of security theatre.</p>
<p>Two days later, after developers inside the EU got their hands on the iOS 17.4 Beta, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@mysk/111857830238574891">word started to leak out that PWAs were broken.</a> Nothing about the change was documented in iOS Beta or Safari release notes. Developers filed <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=268643">plaintive bugs</a> and some directly pinged Apple employees, but Cupertino remained shtum. This created panic and confustion as the window for DMA compliance and the inevitable iOS 17.4 final release closed.</p>

<!--

-->
<p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@mysk/111926735141742246">Two more betas followed,</a> but no documentation or acknowledgement of the "bug." Changes to the broken PWA behavior were introduced, but Apple failed to acknowledge the issue or confirm that it was intentional (and therefore likely to persist). After two weeks of <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/did-apple-just-break-web-apps-in-ios17.4-beta-eu/">growing panic from web developers</a>, <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/its-official-apple-kills-web-apps-in-the-eu/">Apple finally copped to intentionally crippling the only open, tax-free competitor to the app store.</a></p>
<p>Apple's Feb 15th statement is a masterclass in deflection and deceit. To understand why requires a deep understanding of browsers internals and how Apple's closed PWA — sorry, <em>"home screen web app"</em> — system for iOS works.<!-- [^technical-depths-of-depravity] --></p>
<p><em>TL;DR</em>? Apple's cover story is horseshit, stem to stern. Cupertino oughta be ashamed and we web developers are excused for glowing with incandescent rage over being used as pawns; first ignored, then gaslit, and finally betrayed.</p>
<h2 id="lies%2C-damned-lies%2C-and-%22still%2C-we-regret...%22">Lies, Damned Lies, and <em>"Still, we regret..."</em> <a href="#lies%2C-damned-lies%2C-and-%22still%2C-we-regret...%22">#</a></h2>
<p>I really, really hate to do this, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandolini%27s_law">Brandolini's Law</a> dictates that to refute Apple's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Bullshit">bullshit,</a> I'm going to need to go through <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu#8">their gibberish excuses</a> line-by-line to explain and translate. This is going to hurt me more than it hurts you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: Why don’t users in the EU have access to Home Screen web apps?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Translation: <em>"Why did you break functionality that has been a foundational part of iOS since 2007?"</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To comply with the Digital Markets Act, Apple has done an enormous amount of engineering work to add new functionality and capabilities for developers and users in the European Union — including more than 600 new APIs and a wide range of developer tools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Translation: <em>"We're so very tired, you see. All of this litigating to avoid compliance tuckered us right out. Plus, those big meanies at the EU made us do <em>work</em>. It's all very unfair."</em></p>
<p>It goes without saying, but Apple's burden to add APIs it should have long ago provided for competing native app stores has no bearing whatsoever on its obligation to provide fair access to APIs that browser competitors need. Apple also had the same two years warning as everyone else. It knew this was coming, and special pleading at the 11th hour has big <em>"the dog ate my homework"</em> energy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The iOS system has traditionally provided support for Home Screen web apps by building directly on WebKit and its security architecture. That integration means Home Screen web apps are managed to align with the security and privacy model for native apps on iOS, including isolation of storage and enforcement of system prompts to access privacy impacting capabilities on a per-site basis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally! A recitation of facts.</p>
<p>Yes, iOS <em>has</em> historically forced a pretty busted model on PWAs, but iOS is not unique in providing system settings integration for PWAs. Indeed, many OSes have created the sort of integration infrastructure that Apple describes. These systems leave the question of how PWAs are actually run (and where their storage lives) to the browser that installs them, and the sky has yet to fall. Apple is trying to gussy up their mere preferences as hard requirements without any reasonable justification.</p>
<p>Here we see the outline of a strawman; Apple is insinuating that it can't provide API surface areas to allow the sorts of integrations that others already have. Why? Because it might involve writing a lot of code.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/whats-new-in-ios-17-iphfed2c4091/ios">Bless their hearts.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without this type of isolation and enforcement, malicious web apps could read data from other web apps and recapture their permissions to gain access to a user’s camera, microphone or location without a user’s consent.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- This is the bullshit motherlode. The lair of lies. The dungeon of disingenuousness...you get the idea. -->
<p>Keeping one website from abusing permissions or improperly accessing data from another website is what browsers <em>do</em>. It's a browser's one job.</p>
<p>Correctly separating princpals is the very defintion of a "secure" browser. Every single browser vendor (<a href="https://mspoweruser.com/after-ignoring-it-for-6-weeks-apple-starts-testing-fix-for-major-apple-safari-privacy-bug-that-leaks-your-google-id/">save Apple</a>) treats subversion of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy">Same Origin Policy</a> as a showstopping bug to be fixed ASAP. Unbelieveable amounts of engineering go to ensuring browsers overlay stronger sandboxing and more restrictive permissions on top of the universally weaker OS security primitives — iOS very much included.</p>
<p>Browser makers have become masters of origin separation because they run totally untrusted code from all over the internet. Security is paramount because browsers have to be paranoid. They can't just <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/malicious-apps-millions-downloads-apple-google-app-stores">posture about how store reviews</a> will keep users safe; they have to <em>do the work</em>.</p>
<p>Good browsers separate web apps better than bad ones, which makes it particularly rich that Apple of all vendors is directly misleading this way. Apple's decade+ of under-investment in Safari ensured it was much less prepared for <a href="https://meltdownattack.com/">Spectre and Meltdown</a> and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/14/zero-day-exploit-allowed-solarwinds-hackers-to-extract-login-information-from-ios-devices/">Solar Winds</a> that alternaties on other OSes. Competing engines had invested hundreds of engineer years into more advanced <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/site-isolation/">Site Isolation</a> technology than Apple had, and the iOS browser engine monoculture has put users at risk over and over again as a result.</p>
<p>With that as background, we can start to unpack Apple's garbled claim. What Cupertino is alluding to here is that it <em>does not want</em> to create APIs for syncing permission state that would enable the thin shim apps every PWA-supporting OS uses to make website "first class" in the OS — including iOS today. Further, it doesn't want to add APIs for attributing storage use, or clearing state, or other common management tasks.</p>
<p>If those APIs existed, Apple would still have a management question, which it's misdirections also allude to. But these aren't a problem in practice either. Every browser that would offer PWA support would <em>happily</em> sign up to security terms that required accurate synchronization of permission state between OS surfaces and web origins, in exactly the same way they'd dutifully treat cross-origin subversion as a fatal bug to be hot-fixed.</p>
<p>Apple's excusemaking is a mirror of Cupertino's years of scaremongering about alternate browser engine security, only to <a href="https://infrequently.org/2021/08/webkit-ios-deep-dive/#the-abandonware-problem">take up my proposal more-or-less wholesale when the rubber hit the road.</a> Nothing about this is monumental to build or challenging to manage; FruitCo's just hoping you don't know better. And why would you? The set of people who understand these details generously number in the low dozens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Browsers also could install web apps on the system without a user’s awareness and consent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apple know this is a lie. They retain full control over the system APIs that are called to add icons to the homescreen, install apps, and much else. They can shim in interstitial UI if they feel like doing so. If iOS left this to Safari and did not include these sorts precautions, those are choices Apple has made and has been given two years notice to fix.</p>
<p>Cuptertino seems to be saying <em>"bad things might happen if we continued to do a shit job"</em> and one can't help but agree. However, that's no way out of the DMA's obligations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Addressing the complex security and privacy concerns associated with web apps using alternative browser engines would require building an entirely new integration architecture that does not currently exist in iOS and was not practical to undertake given the other demands of the DMA and the very low user adoption of Home Screen web apps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[CITATION NEEDED]</p>
<p>Once again, Apple is counting on the opacity of it's own suppression of the web to keep commenters from understanding the game that's afoot. Through an enervating combination of <a href="https://infrequently.org/2022/06/apple-is-not-defending-browser-engine-choice/#choices%2C-choices">strategic underinvestment</a> and coerced monoculture, Apple created (and still maintains) a huge gap in discoverability and friction for installing web apps vs. their native competition. Stacking the deck for native has taken many forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preventing web apps from gaining distribution in the app store <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#4.2">by explicit policy.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/promoting_apps_with_smart_app_banners">"Smart Banners"</a> that let sites easily offer installation of their native counterparts.</li>
<li>Steadfast refusal to implement <a href="https://web.dev/articles/promote-install#browser-promotion">analagous features for PWAs</a> or provide competing browsers <a href="https://web.dev/learn/pwa/installation-prompt">the OS and DOM APIs they need to do so.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/content/hearingloss/installPWA.html">Burying Web App installation behind a "Share Sheet" UI</a> that users and developers complain is incredibly hard to discover, <a href="https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/getting-your-audience-to-add-to-home-screen">forcing site owners to build clunky intersitials.</a></li>
<li>Denying competitors the necessary API access to offer better install UI and only providing the underwhelming "Share Sheet" option <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/13878/web-push-for-web-apps-on-ios-and-ipados/">last year,</a> a full <em>15 years</em> after Safari could.</li>
</ul>
<p>This campaign of suppression has been widly effective. If users don't know they can install PWAs, it's because <em>Safari never tells them</em>, and until this time last year, neither could any other browser. Developers also struggled to justify building them because Apple's repression extended to neglect of critical features, opening and maininting a substantial capability gap.</p>
<p>If PWAs use on iOS is low, that's a consequence of Apple's own actions. On every other OS where I've seen the data, not only are PWAs a success, they are growing rapidly. Perhaps that's why Apple feels a need to mislead by omission and fail to provide data to back their claim.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And so, to comply with the DMA’s requirements, we had to remove the Home Screen web apps feature in the EU.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bullshit.</p>
<p>Apple's embedded argument expands to:</p>
<ul>
<li>We don't want to comply with the plain-letter language of the law.</li>
<li>To avoid that, we've come up with a legal theory of compliance that's favourable to us.</li>

<p>EU users will be able to continue accessing websites directly from their Home Screen through a bookmark with minimal impact to their functionality. We expect this change to affect a small number of users. Still, we regret any impact this change — that was made as part of the work to comply with the DMA — may have on developers of Home Screen web apps and our users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Translation: <em>"Because fuck you, that's why"</em></p>
<p>Apple is under no obligation by the DMA's terms to nuke PWAs.</p>
<p>Windows and Android will continue supporting PWAs just fine. Apple apparently hopes it can convince you to blame regulators for its own choices. Cupertino's counting the element of surprise plus the press's poorly developed understanding of the situation to keep blowback from snowballing into effective oppostion.</p>
<h3 id="the-point">The Point <a href="#the-point">#</a></h3>
<p>There's no possible way to justify a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/core-technology-fee/">"Core Technology Fee"</a> tax on an open, interoperable, standardsized platform that competitors would provide secure implementations of for free. What Apple's attempting isn't just some hand-wavey removal of a "low use" feature ([CITATION NEEDED]), it's sabotage of the only credible alternative to its app store monopoly.</p>

</figure>
<p>Businesses will get the message: from now on, the only reliable way to get your service under the thumb, or in the notification tray, of the most valuable users in the world is to capitulate to Apple's extortionate App Store taxes.</p>
<p>If the last 15 years are anything to judge by, developers will take longer to understand what's going on, but this is an attempt to pull a <em>"Thoughts on Flash"</em> for the web. Apple's suppression of the web has <a href="https://infrequently.org/2021/04/progress-delayed/">taken many forms</a> over the past decade, but the common thread has been inaction and anti-competitive scuppering of more capable engines. With one of those pillars crumbling, the knives glint a bit more brightly. This is Apple once and for all trying to relegate web development skills to the dustbin of the desktop.</p>
<p>Not only will Apple render web apps unreliable for Safari users, FruitCo is setting up an argument to prevent competitors from ever delivering features that challenge the app store in future. And it doesn't care who it hurts along the way.</p>
<h2 id="the-mask-is-off">The Mask Is Off <a href="#the-mask-is-off">#</a></h2>
<p>This is exactly what it looks like: a single-fingered salute to the web and web developers. The removal of features that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_OS_1">allowed the iPhone to exist at all.</a> The end of <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/before-the-app-store-the-sweet-solution-of-web-apps-and-developers-relentless-passion/">Steve Jobs' promise that you'd be able to make great apps out of HTML, CSS, and JS.</a></p>
<p>For the past few years Apple has gamely sent $1,600/hr lawyers and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-19/apple-flexes-muscle-as-quiet-power-behind-app-developer-group">astroturf lobbyists</a> to argue it didn't need to be regulated. That Apple was really on the developer's side. That even if it overstepped occasionally, it was all in the best interest of users.</p>
<p>Tell that to the millions of EU PWA users about to lose data. Tell that to the public services built on open technology. Tell it to the businesses that will fold, having sweated to deliver compelling experiences using the shite tools Apple web developers. Apple's rug pull is anti-user, anti-developer, and anti-competition.</p>
<p>Now we see the whole effort in harsh relief. A web Apple can't sandbag and degrade is one it can't abide. FruitCo's fear and loathing of an open platform it can't tax is palpable. The lies told to cover for avarice are ridiculous — literally, <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/ridiculous">"worthy of ridicule".</a></p>
<p>It's ok to withhold the benefit of the doubt from Safari and Apple. It's ok to be livid. These lies aren't little or white; they're directly aimed at our future. They're designed to influence the way software will be developed and delivered for decades to come.</p>
<p>If you're as peeved about this as I am, go <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/apple-attempts-killing-webapps/">join OWA in the fight</a> and help them create the sort of pressure in the next 10 days that might actually stop a monopolist with money on their mind.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/la-fda-aprueba-el-primer-medicamento-que-ayuda-reducir-las-reacciones-alergicas-varios-alimentos"><span>Español</span></a></p>

<p>Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2024/103976s5245lbl.pdf">Xolair</a> (omalizumab) injection for immunoglobulin E-mediated food allergy in certain adults and children 1 year or older for the reduction of allergic reactions (Type I), including reducing the risk of anaphylaxis, that may occur with accidental exposure to one or more foods. Patients who take Xolair must continue to avoid foods they are allergic to. Xolair is intended for repeated use to reduce the risk of allergic reactions and is not approved for the immediate emergency treatment of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Xolair was originally approved in 2003 for the treatment of moderate to severe persistent allergic asthma in certain patients. Xolair is also approved to treat chronic spontaneous urticaria and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps in certain patients.</p>

<p><strong>“This newly approved use for Xolair will provide a treatment option to reduce the risk of harmful allergic reactions among certain patients with IgE-mediated food allergies,” said Kelly Stone, M.D., Ph.D., associate director of the Division of Pulmonology, Allergy, and Critical Care in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “While it will not eliminate food allergies or allow patients to consume food allergens freely, its repeated use will help reduce the health impact if accidental exposure occurs.” &nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, almost 6% of people in the United States in 2021 had a food allergy and exposure to the particular food(s) to which they are allergic can lead to potentially life-threatening allergic reactions (i.e., anaphylaxis). There is currently no cure for food allergy. Current treatment requires strict avoidance of the food(s) the patient is allergic to, and prompt administration of epinephrine to treat anaphylaxis should accidental exposures occur. Palforzia (peanut allergen powder) is an oral immunotherapy product approved in patients 4-17 years of age for the mitigation of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, that may occur with accidental exposure to peanut, but its benefits are restricted to peanut allergy. Xolair is the first FDA-approved medication to reduce allergic reactions to more than one type of food after accidental exposure.</p>

<p>Xolair is a drug (in the class of drugs called monoclonal antibodies) that binds to immunoglobulin E (IgE), the antibody type that triggers allergic reactions, and blocks IgE from binding to its receptors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Xolair’s safety and efficacy in reducing allergic reactions in subjects with food allergies was established in one multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03881696">study</a> of 168 pediatric and adult subjects (at least 1 year of age or older) who were allergic to peanut and at least two other foods, including milk, egg, wheat, cashew, hazelnut or walnut. Researchers randomly gave subjects either Xolair or placebo treatment for 16 to 20 weeks. The primary measure of Xolair’s efficacy was the percentage of subjects who were able to eat a single dose (600 milligrams or greater) of peanut protein (equivalent to 2.5 peanuts) without moderate to severe allergic symptoms, such as moderate to severe skin, respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms, at the end of the 16-to-20-week treatment course. Of those who received Xolair, 68% (75 of 110 subjects) were able to eat the single dose of peanut protein without moderate to severe allergic symptoms (e.g., whole body hives, persistent coughing, vomiting), compared to 6% (3 of 55 subjects) who received placebo; these results are statistically significant and clinically meaningful for subjects with food allergy. Of note, however, 17% of subjects receiving Xolair had no significant change in the amount of peanut protein tolerated (could not tolerate 100 mg or more of peanut protein). As a result, continuation of strict allergen avoidance is still necessary, despite treatment with Xolair.</p>

<p>The key secondary measures of efficacy were the percentage of subjects who were able to consume a single dose (1,000 milligrams or greater) of cashew, milk or egg protein without moderate to severe allergic symptoms at the end of the 16-to-20-week treatment course. For cashew, 42% (27 of 64 subjects) who received Xolair achieved this endpoint compared to 3% (1 of 30 subjects) who received placebo. For milk, 66% (25 of 38 subjects) who received Xolair achieved this endpoint, compared to 11% (2 of 19) who received placebo. For egg, 67% (31 of 46 subjects) who received Xolair achieved this endpoint, compared to 0% of the 19 who received placebo. As a result, Xolair treatment is approved for certain patients with one or more IgE-mediated food allergies.</p>

<p>The most common side effects of Xolair observed included injection site reactions and fever. Xolair comes with certain warnings and precautions, such as anaphylaxis, malignancy, fever, joint pain, rash, parasitic (worm) infection and abnormal laboratory tests.</p>

<p>In addition, Xolair comes with a boxed warning for anaphylaxis, which can be life threatening, based on pre-marketing and post-marketing reports of anaphylaxis that occurred after Xolair administration. Anaphylaxis has occurred after the first dose of Xolair, but also has occurred beyond one year after beginning treatment. Xolair should only be started in a healthcare setting equipped to manage anaphylaxis. For selected patients who tolerate initial Xolair treatments in a healthcare setting without anaphylaxis, self-administration (or administration by a caregiver) may be appropriate and should be discussed with a healthcare provider. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Patients should not receive Xolair if they have a history of known severe hypersensitivity to Xolair or any of its components.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Xolair is not approved for the immediate emergency treatment of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Xolair received <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="473790c8-9758-497f-838f-5940f6b613a8" href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review/priority-review" title="Priority Review">Priority Review</a> and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="81e20fd6-29c4-4bdf-861e-f08b5177c4a0" href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review/breakthrough-therapy" title="Breakthrough Therapy">Breakthrough Therapy</a> designations for this indication.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The FDA granted the approval of Xolair to Genentech.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>It's one of those anachronisms that is deeply embedded in modern technology.
From cloud operator servers to embedded controllers in appliances, there
must be uncountable devices that think they are connected to a TTY.</p>
<p>I will omit the many interesting details of the Linux terminal infrastructure
here, as it could easily fill its own article. But most Linux users are at
least peripherally aware that the kernel tends to identify both serial devices
and terminals as TTYs, assigning them filesystem names in the form of
/dev/tty*. Probably a lot of those people remember that this stands for
teletype or perhaps teletypewriter, although in practice the term teleprinter
is more common.</p>
<p>Indeed, from about the 1950s (the genesis of electronic computers) to the 1970s
(the rise of video display terminals/VDTs), teleprinters were the most common
form of interactive human-machine interface. The "interactive" distinction here
is important; early computers were built primarily around noninteractive input
and output, often using punched paper tape. Interactive operation was a more
advanced form of computing, one that took almost until the widespread use of
VDTs to mature. Look into the computers of the 1960s especially, the early days
of interactive operation, and you will be amazed at how bizarre and unfriendly
the command interface is. It wasn't really intended for people to use; it was
for the Computer Operator (who had attended a lengthy training course on the
topic) to troubleshoot problems in the noninteractive workload.</p>
<p>But interactive computing is yet another topic I will one day take on. Right
now, I want to talk about the heritage of these input/output mechanisms. Why is
it that punched paper tape and the teleprinter were the most obvious way to
interact with the first electronic computers? As you might suspect, the
arrangement was one of convenience. Paper tape punches and readers were already
being manufactured, as were teleprinters. They were both used for
communications.</p>
<p>Most people who hear about the telegraph think of Morse code keys and rhythmic
beeping. Indeed, Samuel Morse is an important figure in the history of
telegraphy. The form of "morse code" that we tend to imagine, though, a
continuous wave "beep," is mostly an artifact of radio. For telegraphs, no
carrier wave or radio modulation was required. You can transmit a message
simply by interrupting the current on a wire.</p>
<p>This idea is rather simple to conceive and even to implement, so it's no
surprise that telegraphy has a long history. By the end of the 18th century
inventors in Europe and Great Britain were devising simple electrical
telegraphs. These early telegraphs had limited ranges and even more limited
speeds, though, a result mostly of the lack of a good way to indicate to the
operator whether or not a current was present. It is an intriguing aspect of
technical history that the first decades of experimentation with electricity
were done with only the clumsiest means of measuring or even detecting it.</p>
<p>In 1820, three physicists or inventors (these were vague titles at the time)
almost simultaneously worked out that electrical current induced a magnetic
field. They invented various ways of demonstrating the effect, usually by
deflecting a magnetic needle. This innovation quickly lead to the
"electromagnetic telegraph," in which a telegrapher operates a key to switch
current, which causes a needle or flag to deflect at the other end of the
circuit. This was tremendously simpler than previous means of indicating
current and was applied almost immediately to build the first practical
telegraphs. During the 1830s, the invention of the relay allowed telegraph
signals to be repeated or amplified as the potential weakened (the origin of
the term "relay"). Edward Davy, one of the inventors of the relay, also
invented the telegraph recorder.</p>
<p>From 1830 to 1850, so many people invented so many telegraph systems that it is
difficult to succinctly describe how an early practical telegraph worked. There
were certain themes: for non-recording systems, a needle was often deflected
one way or the other by the presence or absence of current, or perhaps by
polarity reversal. Sometimes the receiver would strike a bell or sound a buzzer
with each change. In recording systems, a telegraph printer or telegraph
recorder embossed a hole or left a small mark on a paper tape that advanced
through the device. In the first case, the receiving operator would watch the
needle, interpreting messages as they came. In the second case, the operator
could examine the paper tape at their leisure, interpreting the message based
on the distances between the dots.</p>
<p>Recording systems tended to be used for less time-sensitive operations like
passing telegrams between cities, while non-recording telegraphs were used for
more real-time applications like railroad dispatch and signaling. Regardless,
it is important to understand that the teleprinter is about as old as the
telegraph. Many early telegraphs recorded received signals onto paper.</p>
<p>The interpretation of telegraph signals was as varied as the equipment that
carried them. Samuel Morse popularized the telegraph in the United States based
in part on his alphabetic code, but it was not the first. Gauss famously
devised a binary encoding for alphabetic characters a few years earlier, which
resembles modern character encodings more than Morse's scheme. In many telegraph
applications, though, there was no alphabetic code at all. Railroad signal
telegraphs, for example, often used application-specific schemes that encoded
types of trains and routes instead of letters.</p>
<p>Morse's telegraph system was very successful in the United States, and in 1861
a Morse telegraph line connected the coasts. It surprises some that a
transcontinental telegraph line was completed some fifty years before the
transcontinental telephone line. Telegraphy is older, though, because it is
simpler. There is no analog signaling involved; simple on/off or polarity
signals can be amplified using simple mechanical relays. The tendency to
view text as more complex than voice (SMS came after the first cellphones,
for one) has more to do with the last 50 years than the 50 years before.</p>
<p>The Morse telegraph system was practical enough to spawn a large industry, but
suffered a key limitation: the level of experience required to key and copy
Morse quickly and reliably is fairly high. Telegraphers were skilled and, thus,
fairly well paid and sometimes in short supply [1]. To drive down the cost of
telegraphy, there would need to be more automation.</p>
<p>Many of the earliest telegraph designs had employed parallel signaling. A
common scheme was to provide one wire for each letter, and a common return.
These were impractical to build over any meaningful distance, and Morse's
one-wire design (along with one-wire designs by others) won out for obvious
reasons. The idea of parallel signaling stayed around, though, and was
reintroduced during the 1840s with a simple form of multiplexing: one "logical
channel" for each letter could be combined onto one wire using time division
muxing, for example by using a transmitter and receiver with synchronized
spinning wheels. Letters would be presented by positions on the wheel, and a
pulse sent at the appropriate point in the revolution to cause the teleprinter
to produce that letter. With this alphabetic teleprinter, an experienced
operator was no longer required to receive messages. They appeared as text on a
strip of paper, ready for an unskilled clerk to read or paste onto a message
card.</p>
<p>This system proved expensive but still practical to operate, and a network of
such alphabetic teleprinters was built in the United States during the mid 19th
century. A set of smaller telegraph companies operating one such system, called
the Hughes system after its inventor, joined together to become the Western
Union Telegraph Company. In a precedent that would be followed even more closely
by the telephone system, practical commercial telegraphy was intertwined with a
monopoly.</p>
<p>The Hughes system was functional but costly. The basic idea of multiplexing
across 30 channels was difficult to achieve with mechanical technology. Émile
Baudot was employed by the French telegraph service to find a way to better
utilize telegraph lines. He first developed a proper form of multiplexing,
using synchronized switches to combine five Hughes system messages onto one
wire and separate them again at the other end. Likely inspired by his close
inspection of the Hughes system and its limitations, Baudot went on to develop
a more efficient scheme for the transmission of alphabetic messages: the Baudot
code.</p>
<p>Baudot's system was similar to the Hughes system in that it relied on a
transmitter and receiver kept in synchronization to interpret pulses as
belonging to the correct logical channel. He simplified the design, though, by
allowing for only five logical channels. Instead of each pulse representing a
letter, the combination of all five channels would be used to form one symbol.
The Baudot code was a five-bit binary alphabetic encoding, and most computer
alphabetic encodings to the present day are at least partially derived from it.</p>
<p>One of the downsides of Baudot's design is that it was not quite as easy to
operate as telegraphy companies would hope. Baudot equipment could keep up 30
words per minute with a skilled operator who could work the five-key
piano-style keyboard in good synchronization with the mechanical armature that
read it out. This took a great deal of practice, though, and pressing keys out
of synchronization with the transmitter could easily cause incorrect letters to
be sent.</p>
<p>In 1901, during the early days of the telephone, Donald Murray developed an
important enhancement to the Baudot system. He was likely informed by an older
practice that had been developed for Morse telegraphs, of having an operator
punch a Morse message into paper tape to be transmitted by a simple tape reader
later.  He did the same for Baudot code: he designed a device with an easy to
use typewriter-like keyboard that punched Baudot code onto a strip of paper
tape with five rows, one for each bit. The tape punch had no need to be
synchronized with the other end, and the operator could type at whatever pace
they were comfortable.</p>
<p>The invention of Murray's tape punch brought about the low-cost telegram
networks that we are familiar with from the early 20th century. A clerk would
take down a message and then punch it onto paper tape. Later, the paper tape
would be inserted into a reader that transmitted the Baudot message in perfect
synchronization with the receiver, a teleprinter that typed it onto tape as
text once again. The process of encoding and decoding messages for the
telegraph was now fully automated.</p>
<p>The total operation of the system, though, was not. For one, the output was
paper tape, that had to be cut and pasted to compose a paragraph of text.
For another, the transmitting and receiving equipment operated continuously,
requiring operators to coordinate on the scheduling of sending messages (or
they would tie up the line and waste a lot of paper tape).</p>
<p>In a wonderful time capsule of early 20th century industrialism, the next major
evolution would come about with considerable help from the Morton Salt Company.
Joy Morton, its founder, agreed to fund Frank Pearne's efforts to develop an
even more practical printing telegraph. This device would use a typewriter
mechanism to produce the output as normal text on a page, saving considerable
effort by clerks. Even better, it would use a system of control codes to
indicate the beginning and end of messages, allowing a teleprinter to operate
largely unattended. This was more complex than it sounded, as it required
finding a way for the two ends to establish clock synchronization before the
message.</p>
<p>There were, it turned out, others working on the same concept. After a series
of patent disputes, mergers, and negotiations, the Morkrum-Kleinschmidt Company
would market this new technology. A fully automated teleprinter, lurching into
life when the other end had a message to send, producing pages of text like a
typewriter with an invisible typist.</p>
<p>In 1928, Morkrum-Kleinschmidt adopted a rather more memorable name: the
Teletype Corporation. During the development of the Teletype system, the
telephone network had grown into a nationwide enterprise and one of the United
States' largest industrial ventures (at many points in time, the country's
single largest employer). AT&amp;T had already entered the telegraph business by
leasing its lines for telegraph use, and work had already begun on telegraphs
that could operate over switched telephone lines, transmitting text as if it
were a phone call. The telephone was born of the telegraph but came to consume
it. In 1930, the Teletype Corporation was purchased by AT&amp;T and became part of
Western Electric.</p>
<p>That same year, Western Electric introduced the Teletype Model 15. Receiving
Baudot at 45 baud [2] with an optional tape punch and tape reader, the Model 15
became a workhorse of American communications. By some accounts, the Model 15
was instrumental in the prosecution of World War II. The War Department made
extensive use of AT&amp;T-furnished teletype networks and Model 15 teleprinters as
the core of the military logistics enterprise. The Model 15 was still being
manufactured as late as 1963, a production record rivaled by few other
electrical devices.</p>
<p>It is difficult to summarize the history of the networks that teleprinters
enabled. The concept of switching connections between teleprinters, as was done
on the phone network, was an obvious one. The dominant switched teleprinter
network was Telex, not really an organization but actually a set of standards
promulgated by the ITU. The most prominent US implementation of Telex was an
AT&amp;T service called TWX, short for Teletypewriter Exchange Service. TWX used
Teletype teleprinters on phone lines (in a special class of service), and was
a very popular service for business use from the '40s to the '70s.</p>
<p>Incidentally, TWX was assigned the special purpose area codes 510, 610, 710,
810, and 910, which contained only teleprinters. These area codes would
eventually be assigned to other uses, but for a long time ranked among the
"unusual" NPAs.</p>
<p>Western Union continued to develop their telegraph network during the era of
TWX, acting in many ways as a sibling or shadow of AT&amp;T. Like AT&amp;T, Western
Union developed multiplexing schemes to make better use of their long-distance
telegraph lines. Like AT&amp;T, Western Union developed automatic switching systems
to decrease operator expenses. Like AT&amp;T, Western Union built out a microwave
network to increase the capacity of their long-haul network. Telegraphy is one
of the areas where AT&amp;T struggled despite their vast network, and Western Union
kept ahead of them, purchasing the TWX service from AT&amp;T. Western Union would
continue to operate the switched teleprinter network, under the Telex name,
into the '80s when it largely died out in favor of the newly developed fax
machine.</p>
<p>During the era of TWX, encoding schemes changed several times as AT&amp;T and
Western Union developed better and faster equipment (Western Union continued to
make use of Western Electric-built Teletype machines among other equipment).
ASCII came to replace Baudot, and so a number of ASCII teleprinters existed.
There were also hybrids. For some time Western Union operated teleprinters on
an ASCII variant that provided only upper case letters and some punctuation,
with the benefit of requiring fewer bits. The encoding and decoding of this
reduced ASCII set was implemented by the Bell 101 telephone modem, designed in
1958 to allow SAGE computers to communicate with one another and then widely
included in TWX and Telex teleprinters. The Bell 101's descendants would bring
about remote access to time-sharing computer systems and, ultimately, one of
the major forms of long-distance computer networking.</p>
<p>You can see, then, that the history of teleprinters and the history of
computers are naturally interleaved. From an early stage, computers operated
primarily on streams of characters. This basic concept is still the core of
many modern computer systems and, not coincidentally, also describes the
operation of teleprinters.</p>
<p>When electronic computers were under development in the 1950s and 1960s,
teleprinters were near the apex of their popularity as a medium for business
communications. Most people working on computers probably had experience with
teleprinters; most organizations working on computers already had a number of
teleprinters installed. It was quite natural that teleprinter technology would
be repurposed as a means of input and output for computers.</p>
<p>Some of the very earliest computers, for example those of Konrad Zuse, employed
punched tape as an input medium. These were almost invariably repurposed or
modified telegraphic punched tape systems, often in five-bit Baudot.
Particularly in retrospect, as more materials have become available to
historians, it is clear that much of the groundwork for digital computing was
laid by WWII cryptological efforts.</p>
<p>Newly devised cryptographic machines like the Lorenz ciphers were essentially
teleprinters with added digital logic. The machines built to attack these
codes, like Colossus, are now generally recognized as the first programmable
computers. The line between teleprinter and computer was not always clear. As
more encoding and control logic was added, teleprinters came to resemble simple
computers.</p>
<p>The Manchester Mark I, a pioneer of stored-program computing built in 1949,
used a 5-bit code adopted from Baudot by none other than Alan Turing. The major
advantage of this 5-bit encoding was, of course, that programs could be read
and written using Baudot tape and standard telegraph equipment. The addition of
a teleprinter allowed operators to "interactively" enter instructions into the
computer and read the output, although the concept of a shell (or any other
designed user interface) had not yet been developed. EDSAC, a contemporary of
the Mark I and precursor to a powerful tea logistics system that would set off
the development of business computing, also used a teleprinter for input and
output.</p>
<p>Many early commercial computers limited input and output to paper tape, often
5-bit for Baudot or 8-bit for ASCII with parity, as in the early days of
computing preparation of a program was an exacting process that would not
typically be done "on the fly" at a keyboard. It was, of course, convenient
that teleprinters with tape punches could be used to prepare programs for entry
into the computer.</p>
<p>Business computing is most obviously associated with IBM, a company that had
large divisions building both computers and typewriters. The marriage of the
two was inevitable considering the existing precedent. Beginning around 1960 it
was standard for IBM computers to furnish a teleprinter as the operator
interface, but IBM had a distinct heritage from the telecommunications industry
and, for several reasons, was intent on maintaining that distinction. IBM's
teleprinter-like devices were variously called Data Communications Systems,
Printer-Keyboards, Consoles, and eventually Terminals. They generally operated
over proprietary serial channels.</p>
<p>Other computer manufacturers didn't have typewriter divisions, and typewriters
and teleprinters were actually rather complex mechanical devices and not all
that easy to build. As a result, they tended to buy teleprinters from
established manufacturers, often IBM or Western Electric. Consider the case of
a rather famous non-IBM computer, the DEC PDP-1 of 1960. It came with a CRT
graphics display as standard, and many sources will act as if this was the
primary operator interface, but it is important to understand that early CRT
graphics displays had a hard time with text. Text is rather complex to render
when you are writing point-by-point to a CRT vector display from a rather slow
machine. You would be surprised how many vertices a sentence has in it.</p>
<p>So despite the ready availability of CRTs in the 1960s (they were, of course,
well established in the television industry), few computers used them for
primary text input/output. Instead, the PDP-1 was furnished with a modified IBM
typewriter as its console. This scheme of paying a third-party company (Soroban
Engineering) to modify IBM typewriters for teleprinter control was apparently
not very practical, and later DEC PDP models tended to use Western Electric
Teletypes as user terminals. These had the considerable advantage that they
were already designed to operate over long telephone circuits, making it easy
to install multiple terminals throughout a building for time sharing use.</p>
<p>Indeed, time sharing was a natural fit for teleprinter terminals. With a
teleprinter and a computer with a suitable modem, you could "call in" to a time
sharing computer over the telephone from a remote office. Most of the first
practical "computer networks" (term used broadly) were not actually networks of
computers, but a single computer with many remote terminals.  This architecture
evolved into the BBS and early Internet-like services such as CompuServe. The
idea was surprisingly easy to implement once time sharing operating systems
were developed; the necessary hardware was already available from Western
Electric.</p>
<p>While I cannot swear to the accuracy of this attribution, many sources suggest
that the term "tty" as a generic reference to a user terminal or serial I/O
channel originated with DEC. It seems reasonable; DEC's software was very
influential on the broader computer industry, particularly outside of IBM.
UNIX originally targeted a PDP-11 with teleprinters. While I can't prove it, it
seems quite believable that the tty terminology was adopted directly from RT-11
or another operating system that Bell Labs staff might have used on the PDP-11.</p>
<p>Computers were born of the teleprinter and would inevitably come to consume
them. After all, what is a computer but a complex teleprinter? Today,
displaying text and accepting it from a keyboard is among the most basic
functions of computers, and computers continue to perform this task using an
architecture that would be familiar to engineers in the 1970s. They would
likely be more surprised by what hasn't changed than what has: many of us still
spend a lot of time in graphical software pretending to be a video display
terminal built for compatibility with teleprinters.</p>
<p>And we're still using that 7-bit ASCII code a lot, aren't we. At least Baudot
died out and we get to enjoy lower case letters.</p>
<p>[1] Actor, singer, etc. Gene Autry had worked as a telegrapher before he began
his career in entertainment. This resulted in no small number of stories of a
celebrity stand-in at the telegraph office. Yes, this is about to be a local
history anecdote. It is fairly reliably reported that Gene Autry once
volunteered to stand in for the telegrapher and station manager at the small
Santa Fe Railroad station in Socorro, New Mexico, as the telegrapher had been
temporarily overwhelmed by the simultaneous arrival of a packed train and a
series of telegrams. There are enough of these stories about Gene that I think
he really did keep his Morse sharp well into his acting career.</p>
<p>[2] Baud is a somewhat confusing unit derived from Baudot. Baud refers to the
number of symbols per second on the underlying communication medium. For simple
binary systems (and thus many computer communications systems we encounter
daily), baud rate is equivalent to bit rate (bps). For systems that employ
multi-level signaling, the bit rate will be higher than the baud rate, as
multiple bits are represented per symbol on the wire. Methods like QAM are
useful because they result in bit rates that are many multiples of the baud
rate, reducing the bandwidth on the wire.</p>

    <p>Any role in the military can be stressful. However, for those like special operators, explosive ordinance technicians, submariners, aviators and others, stress is a significant part of the job. The extreme stress faced by these warriors, and others, can lead to psychological health concerns. Recent research focusing on special operations forces (SOF) highlights the risks faced by service members working in any high-stress role. Heavy physical, mental and emotional strain can lead to psychological health concerns. These can include depression, anxiety or posttraumatic stress disorder. It is important for all warriors to learn stress-management techniques. Stress can cause anxiety, depression, trouble sleeping, irritability, heavy drinking or other concerns. If you experience any of these symptoms, or have other concerns, talk to a health care provider now. Your provider can address your concerns and help you develop a stress-management plan. Getting care early helps you stay mission ready. It also avoids new or worsening symptoms.</p><h2><strong>The Effects of Stress on SOF</strong></h2><p>
SOF personnel are an example of service members supporting high-stress operations. The nature of their work is sensitive, and they make frequent deployments, often on short notice. They have strong resilience skills because of SOF selection screenings and their follow-on training. However, they aren't immune to the effects of high-stress operations. In one survey about twice as many members of SOF units reported symptoms associated with PTSD when compared to members of conventional units. Others, like drone pilots, face similar stressors. Executing critical missions, dealing with life-and-death decisions and safeguarding classified information all adds up. That makes robust skills for managing stress crucial if you're in these types of roles.</p><h2><strong>Skills That Aid Job Performance Under High Stress</strong></h2><p>
The ability to perform under high stress is critical to mission readiness. Service members, like special operators, use stress inoculation training to stay focused and effective when the going gets tough. This type of training teaches you skills to manage stress responses at critical times by:</p><ol>
    <li>
    Controlling emotions. Reduce negative thinking and fear. This avoids distracting thoughts during a critical mission.</li>
    <li>
    Calming physical reactions to stress. Use regular, slow breathing from your diaphragm and progressive muscle relaxation. This reduces your heart rate and anxiety.</li>
    <li>
    Training with repetition. Repeat tasks that require a consistent response until you can do them on autopilot.</li>
    <li>
    Visualizing tasks. Envision successfully using your skills in action right before you need them.</li>
    <li>
    Learning prioritization. Order tasks to deal with information overload and manage multiple high-priority assignments at the same time.</li>
    <li>
    Building team skills. Communicate, give constructive feedback, coordinate group efforts and ask for help when needed.</li>
</ol><p>Additional skills woven into service-specific trainings for high-stress operations include:</p><ul>
    <li>
    Goal-setting</li>
    <li>
    Persistence</li>
    <li>
    Situational awareness</li>
    <li>
    Attentional conditioning</li>
    <li>
    Muscle control</li>
</ul><h2><strong>Stress Reduction Techniques</strong></h2><ul>
    <li>
    All warriors with high-stress jobs can benefit from basic stress-reduction techniques. To reduce stress:</li>
    <li>
    Exercise regularly. Cardio and strength training reduce stress levels and keep you mission ready.</li>
    <li>
    Get good sleep. Poor sleep or not enough sleep has a significant negative impact on wellbeing.</li>
    <li>
    Eat healthy. A good diet helps keep your body and mind in shape.</li>
    <li>
    Participate in relaxing activities. Breathing-based meditation and yoga, for example, can improve symptoms and reduce anxiety.</li>
    <li>
    Stay connected. The support of friends and family improves psychological health when facing stress.</li>
</ul><p>
Remember, reaching out is a sign of strength. If you or a loved one needs additional support, contact the Psychological Health Resource Center 24/7 to confidentially speak with trained health resource consultants. Call 866-966-1020 or use the Real Warriors Live Chat. You can also see a list of key psychological health resources here.</p><h2>Additional Resources:</h2><ul>

	The United States is not building enough transmission lines to connect regional power networks. The deficit is driving up electricity prices, reducing grid reliability, and hobbling renewable-energy deployment.
</p><p>
	At the heart of the problem are utility companies that refuse to pursue interregional transmission projects, and sometimes even impede them, because new projects threaten their profits and disrupt their industry alliances. Utilities can stall transmission expansion because out-of-date laws sanction these companies’ sweeping control over transmission development.
</p><p>
	As we increasingly electrify our homes, transportation, and factories, utility companies’ choices about transmission will have huge consequences for the nation’s economy and well-being. About 40 corporations, valued at a trillion dollars, own the vast majority of transmission lines in the United States. Their grip over the backbone of U.S. grids demands public scrutiny and accountability.
</p><h2>Many Lines, Stable Power </h2><p>
	High-voltage transmission lines move large amounts of energy over long distances, linking power generation to consumption. A transmission network contains webs of connections, which create a reliable, redundant power-supply system of massive scale.
</p><p>
	At any given time, thousands of power plants supply just enough energy to transmission networks to meet demand. The rules that orchestrate the movement of electricity through this network determine who generates power, and how much. The goal is to keep the lights on at a low cost by utilizing an efficient mix of power plants.</p><p>
	Building more transmission increases the capacity and connectivity of the system, allowing new power plants to connect and more power to flow between transmission networks. This is 
	<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w32091" target="_blank">why utility companies are not embracing transmission</a> expansion. They don’t want their power plants to face competition or their regional alliances to lose control over their networks.
</p><p>
	Expansion can open opportunities for new power-plant and transmission developers to undercut utility companies’ profits and take control over the rules that shape the industry’s future. Utility companies are prioritizing their shareholders over the public’s need for cleaner, cheaper, and more reliable energy.
</p><h2>Old Alliances, Old Technology  </h2><p>
	Transmission networks in the United States, which move alternating current, were built over the last century largely by for-profit utility companies, and to a lesser extent by nonprofit utilities operated by governments and local communities. The lines tend to be concentrated around fossil-fuel reserves and population centers but are also shaped by historic utility alliances.
</p><p>
	Where utilities agreed to trade energy, they built sufficient transmission to move power between their local service territories. As utility alliances expanded, transmission networks grew to include new members, but connections to nonallied utilities tended to be weaker.
</p><p>
	The result of these generations-old alliances is a U.S. system fragmented into 
	<a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/ferc-is-coalescing-around-the-idea-of-minimum-transfer-capacity-but-needs-data-and-definitions/" target="_blank">about a dozen regions</a> with limited connectivity between them. The regions are distributed across three separate and largely isolated networks, called “<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/why-does-the-us-have-three-electrical-grids" target="_self">interconnections</a>”–Eastern, Western, and most of Texas.
</p><p>
	An October 2023 
	<a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-12/National%20Transmission%20Needs%20Study%20-%20Final_2023.12.1.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> from the U.S. Department of Energy reveals the severity of the problem. Based on studies conducted by national labs and academic researchers, the DoE calculated that interregional transmission in the United States must expand as much as <em>fivefold</em> to maintain reliability and improve resilience to extreme weather and provide access to low-cost clean energy.
</p><p>
	The value of linking regional networks 
	<a href="https://cleanenergygrid.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Macro-Grids-in-the-Mainstream-1.pdf" target="_blank">is widely</a> accepted globally. The European Commission in 2018 <a href="https://perma.cc/JUF9-XR2X" target="_blank">set a target</a> for each member country to transmit across its borders at least 15 percent of the electricity produced in its territories. By the end of 2022, <a href="https://perma.cc/DHY7-BZVK" target="_blank">23 gigawatts</a> of cross-border connections in Europe were under construction or in advanced stages of permitting, with <a href="https://tyndp.entsoe.eu/" target="_blank">much more on the way</a>.
</p><h2>Big Benefits   </h2><p>
	One of the main values of connecting regional networks is that it enables—and is in fact 
	<a href="https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/100-percent-clean-electricity-by-2035-study.html" target="_blank">critical</a> for—incorporating renewable energy. For instance, four <a href="https://cdn.misoenergy.org/JTIQ%20Report623262.pdf" target="_blank">proposed high-voltage lines</a> totaling 600 kilometers along the seam of regional networks in the upper Midwest could connect at least 28 gigawatts of wind and solar. These lines have been on the drawing board for years, but utilities in the neighboring regions have not moved them forward. The cost of the project, estimated at <a href="https://www.rtoinsider.com/miso-spp-jtiq-portfolio-cost-estimate-doubles/" target="_blank">US $1.9 billion</a>, may seem like a major investment, but it is a fraction of what U.S. utilities spend each year rebuilding aging transmission infrastructure.
</p><p>
	Plus, adding interregional transmission for renewables can 
	<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9770742" target="_blank">significantly reduce costs</a> for consumers. Such connections allow excess wind and solar power to flow to neighboring regions when weather conditions are favorable and allow the import of energy from elsewhere when renewables are less productive.

Interregional transmission also <span>enhances </span><span>reliability,</span><span>particularly during extreme weather.</span><br></p><p>
	In December 2022, Winter Storm Elliott 
	<a href="https://www.ferc.gov/media/winter-storm-elliott-report-inquiry-bulk-power-system-operations-during-december-2022" target="_blank">disabled power plants and pipelines </a>from North Dakota to Georgia, leading to power outages in the South and billions of dollars in excess energy charges across the Eastern United States. Limited interregional connections <a href="https://acore.org/resources/the-value-of-transmission-during-winter-storm-elliott/" target="_blank">staved off disaster</a>. These links moved electricity to where it was most needed, helping to avoid the sort of catastrophe that befell Texas’s isolated electric grid the year before, when a deep freeze left millions without power for days.
</p><h2>Power, Profit, and Control  </h2><p>
	But from the perspective of utility companies, interregional transmission presents several drawbacks. First, building such connections 
	<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w32091" target="_blank">opens the door for competitors</a> who may sell lower-priced power into their region. Second, utilities make far more money constructing power plants than <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dan.slanger/viz/shared/ZDXJGTHJN" target="_blank">building transmission lines</a>, so they are reluctant to build connections that might permanently reduce their opportunities for future generation investments.
</p><p><img id="1ea95" data-rm-shortcode-id="6ce0d3ee56e6ed4ddab7516df20d9ea5" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/graph-comparing-existing-transmission-with-anticipated-need-by-2035-for-18-regions-in-the-u-s.png?id=51524814&amp;width=980" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/graph-comparing-existing-transmission-with-anticipated-need-by-2035-for-18-regions-in-the-u-s.png?id=51524814&amp;width=980" width="2844" height="1867" alt="Graph comparing existing transmission with anticipated need by 2035 for 18 regions in the U.S."><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">This comparison of current interregional transfer capacity and anticipated need shows that regions will need to increase transmission significantly, assuming moderate load and high clean-energy growth.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">“National Transmission Needs Study,” U.S. Department of Energy</small></p><p>
	Third, major interregional transmission projects are less financially attractive to utility companies in comparison with smaller ones. For larger projects, utilities may have to compete against other developers for the opportunity to profit from construction. The utility industry sponsors 
	<a href="https://elibrary.ferc.gov/eLibrary/filelist?accession_number=20230323-5161&amp;optimized=false" target="_blank">third-party oversight</a> of such projects, while smaller projects are less scrutinized by the industry. Smaller projects <a href="https://elibrary.ferc.gov/eLibrary/filelist?accession_number=20230323-5189&amp;optimized=false" target="_blank">are easier to pull off</a> and <a href="https://perma.cc/SY72-QY45" target="_blank">more profitable</a> than the larger ones, because they need fewer construction permits, face less review by regulators and industry, and are built by utilities without competition from other developers.
</p><p>
	Fourth, interregional lines threaten utility companies’ dominance over the nation’s power supply. In the power industry, 
	<a href="https://www.eba-net.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/8-Peskoe547-618.pdf" target="_blank">asset ownership provides control</a> over rules that govern energy markets and transmission service and expansion. When upstart entities build power plants and transmission lines, they may be able to dilute utility companies’ control over power-industry rules and prevent utilities from dictating decisions about transmission expansion.
</p><h2>Help on the Hill  </h2><p>
	Addressing the transmission shortage is on the agenda in Washington, but utility companies are lobbying against reforms. In September, Senator John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) and Representative Scott Peters (D-Calif.) introduced the 
	<a href="https://www.hickenlooper.senate.gov/press_releases/hickenlooper-peters-introduce-big-wires-act-to-reform-permitting-lower-energy-costs/" target="_blank">BIG WIRES Act</a> to force utilities or competing developers to build more interregional links. In 2022, Senator Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) <a href="https://energy.senate.gov/2022/12/manchin-releases-permitting-text-and-urges-colleagues-to-support-mvp-and-permitting-amendment-to-ndaa" target="_blank">proposed an approach</a> in which transmission developers recommend projects to the DoE. If the agency deems a project to be in the national interest, federal regulators could permit the project’s construction and force utilities to pay for it.
</p><p>
	Meanwhile, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is currently reevaluating how utilities develop and operate transmission networks and 
	<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/ferc-proposed-transmission-planning-rule-phillips-clements/700423/" target="_blank">may issue new rules</a> in the coming months. In response, utilities are preparing litigation that could strip FERC of authority to impose any transmission rules at all. Their goal is to protect their profits and control, even if it comes at the consumer’s expense.
</p><p>
	The U.S. Department of Energy is pitching in too. On 6 February, the department announced it would award $1.2 billion to support new high-voltage transmission lines, on top of the $1.3 billion it provided last fall to three interstate projects. Later this year, it plans to unveil its long-awaited 
	<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/01/19/2022-00883/building-a-better-grid-initiative-to-upgrade-and-expand-the-nations-electric-transmission-grid-to" target="_blank">national plan</a> for a large-scale transmission build-out. But without industry support or tens of billions in additional funding from Congress to build these projects, the agency’s vision will not be realized.
</p><h2>Leading With Technology  </h2><p>
	New business models and technologies offer hope. Investors and entrepreneurs are developing long-distance 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/multiterminal-hvdc-networks" target="_self">direct-current lines</a>, which are <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/multiterminal-hvdc-networks" target="_self">more efficient at moving</a> large amounts of energy over long distances, compared with AC. These DC projects sidestep the utility-dominated transmission-expansion planning processes.
</p><p>
	Many high-voltage DC (HVDC) transmission lines are already in operation, especially in 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/chinas-ambitious-plan-to-build-the-worlds-biggest-supergrid" target="_self">China</a> and Europe. In fact, DC lines are now the <a href="https://tyndp.entsoe.eu/explore/about-the-tyndp-project-portfolio" target="_blank">preferred choice in Europe’s plans</a> to unite the continent.
</p><p>
	The United States lacks a coordinated national planning effort to connect regional networks, but developers can make progress project by project. For example, future DC lines will connect generators in 
	<a href="https://grainbeltexpress.com/" target="_blank">Kansas to a neighboring network in Illinois,</a> stretch from <a href="https://www.transwestexpress.net/" target="_blank">Wyoming to California</a>, and <a href="https://patternenergy.com/projects/sunzia/" target="_blank">move wind and solar energy</a><a href="https://patternenergy.com/projects/sunzia/" target="_blank"> across the Southwest</a>. Each of these projects will move renewable energy from where it can be generated cheaply to larger markets where power prices are higher, and in doing so they will help bolster the country’s regional transmission networks.
</p><p>
	These pioneering projects show that utility companies in the United States don’t have to build interregional lines, but they do need to get out of the way. Transmission rules written by utilities and their industry allies can 
	<a href="https://www.ferc.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/E-19-061820.pdf" target="_blank">obstruct</a>, <a href="https://elibrary.ferc.gov/eLibrary/filedownload?fileid=6DB63A1D-ACDF-C2A8-87D9-8CF539B00000" target="_blank">delay</a>, and <a href="https://elibrary.ferc.gov/eLibrary/filedownload?fileid=15816262" target="_blank">add costs</a> to these new projects. Streamlining federal and state permitting processes can encourage more investment, but cutting government red tape will not neutralize utility companies’ objections to interregional transmission.
</p><p>
	U.S. regulators and Congress must press forward. Promising proposals that promote new business models and limit utility control are on the table. Our energy future is on the line.

It had been a successful year: a new plant had opened, and the company had doubled the amount of squid that it exported to the United States. The party, according to videos posted on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, featured singers, instrumentalists, dancers, fireworks, and strobe lights. One aspect of the company’s success seems to have been its use of North Korean workers, who are sent by their government to work in Chinese factories, in conditions of captivity, to earn money for the state. A seafood trader who does business with Jinhui recently estimated that it employed between fifty and seventy North Koreans. Videos posted by a company representative show machines labelled in Korean, and workers with North Korean accents explaining how to clean squid. At the party, the company played songs that are popular in Pyongyang, including “People Bring Glory to Our Party” (written by North Korea’s 1989 poet laureate) and “We Will Go to Mt. Paektu” (a reference to the widely mythologized birthplace of Kim Jong Il). Performers wore North Korean colors, and the country’s flag billowed behind them; in the audience, dozens of workers held miniature flags.</p><div><figure><figcaption><p><span>A party held by Donggang Jinhui Foodstuff, a seafood-processing company in Dandong, China, last year, included what appeared to be North Korean workers.</span><span>Source: Douyin</span></p></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Drone footage played at the event showed off Jinhui’s twenty-one-acre, fenced-in compound, which has processing and cold-storage facilities and what appears to be a seven-floor dormitory for workers. The company touted a wide array of Western certifications from organizations that claim to check workplaces for labor violations, including the use of North Korean workers. When videos of the party were posted online, a commenter—presumably befuddled, because using these workers violates U.N. sanctions—asked, “Aren’t you prohibited from filming this?”</p><p>Like Jinhui, many companies in China rely on a vast program of forced labor from North Korea. (Jinhui did not respond to requests for comment.) The program is run by various entities in the North Korean government, including a secretive agency called Room 39, which oversees activities such as money laundering and cyberattacks, and which funds the country’s nuclear- and ballistic-missile programs. (The agency is so named, according to some defectors, because it is based in the ninth room on the third floor of the Korean Workers’ Party headquarters.) Such labor transfers are not new. In 2012, North Korea sent some forty thousand workers to China. A portion of their salaries was taken by the state, providing a vital source of foreign currency for Party officials: at the time, a Seoul-based think tank estimated that the country made as much as $2.3 billion a year through the program. Since then, North Koreans have been sent to Russia, Poland, Qatar, Uruguay, and Mali.</p><p>In 2017, after North Korea tested a series of nuclear and ballistic weapons, the United Nations imposed sanctions that prohibit foreign companies from using North Korean workers. The U.S. passed a law that established a “rebuttable presumption” categorizing work by North Koreans as forced labor unless proven otherwise, and levying fines on companies that import goods tied to these workers. China is supposed to enforce the sanctions in a similar manner. Nevertheless, according to State Department estimates, there are currently as many as a hundred thousand North Koreans working in the country. Many work at construction companies, textile factories, and software firms. Some also process seafood. In 2022, according to Chinese officials running pandemic quarantines, there were some eighty thousand North Koreans just in Dandong, a hub of the seafood industry.</p><p>Last year, I set out with a team of researchers to document this phenomenon. We reviewed leaked government documents, promotional materials, satellite imagery, online forums, and local news reports. We watched hundreds of cell-phone videos published on social-media sites. In some, the presence of North Koreans was explicit. Others were examined by experts to detect North Korean accents, language usage, and other cultural markers. Reporting in China is tightly restricted for Western reporters. But we hired Chinese investigators to visit factories and record footage of production lines. I also secretly sent interview questions, through another group of investigators and their contacts, to two dozen North Koreans—twenty workers and four managers—who had recently spent time in Chinese factories. Their anonymous responses were transcribed and sent back to me.</p></div></div><div><p>The workers, all of whom are women, described conditions of confinement and violence at the plants. Workers are held in compounds, sometimes behind barbed wire, under the watch of security agents. Many work gruelling shifts and get at most one day off a month. Several described being beaten by the managers sent by North Korea to watch them. “It was like prison for me,” one woman said. “At first, I almost vomited at how bad it was, and, just when I got used to it, the supervisors would tell us to shut up, and curse if we talked.” Many described enduring sexual assault at the hands of their managers. “They would say I’m fuckable and then suddenly grab my body and grope my breasts and put their dirty mouth on mine and be disgusting,” a woman who did product transport at a plant in the city of Dalian said. Another, who worked at Jinhui, said, “The worst and saddest moment was when I was forced to have sexual relations when we were brought to a party with alcohol.” The workers described being kept at the factories against their will, and being threatened with severe punishment if they tried to escape. A woman who was at a factory called Dalian Haiqing Food for more than four years said, “It’s often emphasized that, if you are caught running away, you will be killed without a trace.”</p><p>In all, I identified fifteen seafood-processing plants that together seem to have used more than a thousand North Korean workers since 2017. China officially denies that North Korean laborers are in the country. But their presence is an open secret. “They are easy to distinguish,” a Dandong native wrote in a comment on Bilibili, a video-sharing site. “They all wear uniform clothes, have a leader, and follow orders.” Often, footage of the workers ends up online. In a video from a plant called Dandong Yuanyi Refined Seafoods, a dozen women perform a synchronized dance in front of a mural commemorating Youth Day, a North Korean holiday. The video features a North Korean flag emoji and the caption “Beautiful little women from North Korea in Donggang’s cold-storage facility.” (The company did not respond to requests for comment.) Remco Breuker, a North Korea specialist at Leiden University, in the Netherlands, told me, “Hundreds of thousands of North Korean workers have for decades slaved away in China and elsewhere, enriching their leader and his party while facing unconscionable abuse.”</p></div><div><div><figure><div><picture><img loading="lazy" src="https://downloads.newyorker.com/projects/2024/240226-north-korea-urbina/photos/office_manager_north_korea.jpg" alt="A photo of an office that had a wooden desk with two miniature flags, one Chinese and one North Korean.

Portions of this image have been blurred to protect sources.</span><span>Photograph from The Outlaw Ocean Project</span></p></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>In late 2023, an investigator hired by my team visited a Chinese plant called Donggang Xinxin Foodstuff. He found hundreds of North Korean women working under a red banner that read, in Korean, “Let’s carry out the resolution of the 8th Congress of the Workers’ Party.” (The company did not respond to requests for comment.) Soon afterward, the investigator visited a nearby plant called Donggang Haimeng Foodstuff, and found a North Korean manager sitting at a wooden desk with two miniature flags, one Chinese and one North Korean. The walls around the desk were mostly bare except for two portraits of the past North Korean leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. The manager took our investigator to the workers’ cafeteria to eat a North Korean cold-noodle dish called <em>naengmyeon</em>, and then gave him a tour of the processing floor. Several hundred North Korean women dressed in red uniforms, plastic aprons, and white rubber boots stood shoulder to shoulder at long metal tables under harsh lights, hunched over plastic baskets of seafood, slicing and sorting products by hand. “They work hard,” the manager said. The factory has exported thousands of tons of fish to companies that supply major U.S. retailers, including Walmart and ShopRite. (A spokesperson for Donggang Haimeng said that it does not hire North Korean workers.)</p><p>At times, China aggressively conceals the existence of the program. Alexander Dukalskis, a political-science professor at University College Dublin, said that workers have a hard time making their conditions known. “They’re in a country where they may not speak the language, are under surveillance, usually living collectively, and have no experience in contacting journalists,” he said. In late November, after my team’s investigators visited several plants, authorities distributed pamphlets on the country’s anti-espionage laws. Local officials announced that people who try “to contact North Korean workers, or to approach the workplaces of North Korean workers, will be treated as engaging in espionage activities that endanger national security, and will be punished severely.” They also warned that people who were found to be working in connection with foreign media outlets would face consequences under the Anti-Espionage Act.</p></div></div><div><div><figure><div><picture><source srcset="https://downloads.newyorker.com/projects/2024/240226-north-korea-urbina/map/north_korea_china_border_desktop_02.jpg" media="(min-width: 1024px)"><img loading="lazy" src="https://downloads.newyorker.com/projects/2024/240226-north-korea-urbina/map/north_korea_china_border_mobile_02.jpg"></picture></div><figcaption><p><span>The border between China and North Korea.</span></p></figcaption></figure></div><div><p><em>Dandong, a city of more than two million people</em>, sits on the Yalu River, just over the border from North Korea. The Sino-Korean Friendship Bridge links Dandong to the North Korean city of Sinuiju. A second bridge, bombed during the Korean War, still extends partway across the river, and serves as a platform from which Chinese residents can view the North Koreans living six hundred yards away. The Friendship Bridge is one of the Hermit Kingdom’s few gateways to the world. Some trade with North Korea is allowed under U.N. sanctions, and nearly seventy per cent of the goods exchanged between that country and China travel across this bridge. At least one department store in Dandong keeps a list of products preferred by North Korean customers. Shops sell North Korean ginseng, beer, and “7.27” cigarettes, named for the date on which the armistice ending the Korean War was signed. The city is home to a museum about the conflict, officially called the Memorial Hall of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. On boat tours, Chinese tourists purchase bags of biscuits to toss to children on the North Korean side of the river.</p><p>Government officials carefully select workers to send to China, screening them for their political loyalties to reduce the risk of defections. To qualify, a person must generally have a job at a North Korean company and a positive evaluation from a local Party official. “These checks start at the neighborhood,” Breuker said. Candidates who have family in China, or a relative who has already defected, can be disqualified. For some positions, applicants under twenty-seven years of age who are unmarried must have living parents, who can be punished if they try to defect, according to a report from the South Korean government; applicants over twenty-seven must be married. North Korean authorities even select for height: the country’s population is chronically malnourished, and the state prefers candidates who are taller than five feet one, to avoid the official embarrassment of being represented abroad by short people. Once selected, applicants go through pre-departure training, which can last a year and often includes government-run classes covering everything from Chinese customs and etiquette to “enemy operations” and the activities of other countries’ intelligence agencies. (The North Korean government did not respond to requests for comment.)</p><p>The governments of both countries coördinate to place workers, most of whom are women, with seafood companies. The logistics are often handled by local Chinese recruitment agencies, and advertisements can be found online. A video posted on Douyin this past September announced the availability of twenty-five hundred North Koreans, and a commenter asked if they could be sent to seafood factories. A post on a forum advertised five thousand workers; a commenter asked if any spoke Mandarin, and the poster replied, “There is a team leader, management, and an interpreter.” A company called Jinuo Human Resources posted, “I am a human-resources company coöperating with the embassy, and currently have a large number of regular North Korean workers.” Several people expressed interest. (The company did not respond to requests for comment.)</p><p>Jobs in China are coveted in North Korea, because they often come with contracts promising salaries of around two hundred and seventy dollars a month. (Similar work in North Korea pays just three dollars a month.) But the jobs come with hidden costs. Workers usually sign two- or three-year contracts. When they arrive in China, managers confiscate their passports. Inside the factories, North Korean workers wear different uniforms than Chinese workers. “Without this, we couldn’t tell if one disappeared,” a manager said. Shifts run as long as sixteen hours. If workers attempt to escape, or complain to people outside the plants, their families at home can face reprisals. One seafood worker described how managers cursed at her and flicked cigarette butts. “I felt bad, and I wanted to fight them, but I had to endure,” she said. “That was when I was sad.”</p><div><h6>The Daily

</p></div><p>Workers get few, if any, holidays or sick days. At seafood plants, the women sleep in bunk beds in locked dormitories, sometimes thirty to a room. One worker, who spent four years processing clams in Dandong, estimated that more than sixty per cent of her co-workers suffered from depression. “We regretted coming to China but couldn’t go back empty-handed,” she said. Workers are forbidden to tune in to local TV or radio. They are sometimes allowed to leave factory grounds—say, to go shopping—but generally in groups of no more than three, and accompanied by a minder. Mail is scrutinized by North Korean security agents who also “surveil the daily life and report back with official reports,” one manager said. Sometimes the women are allowed to socialize. In a video titled “North Korean beauties working in China play volleyball,” posted in 2022, women in blue-and-white uniforms exercise on the grounds of the Dandong Omeca Food seafood plant. (The company that owns the plant did not respond to requests for comment.) A commenter wrote, “The joy of poverty. That’s just how it is.”</p><p>Factories typically give the women’s money to their managers, who take cuts for themselves and the government, and hold on to the rest until the workers’ terms in China end. Kim Jieun, a North Korean defector who now works for Radio Free Asia, said that companies tell workers their money is safer this way, because it could be stolen in the dormitories. But, in the end, workers often see less than ten per cent of their promised salary. One contract that I reviewed stipulated that around forty dollars would be deducted each month by the state to pay for food. More is sometimes deducted for electricity, housing, heat, water, insurance, and “loyalty” payments to the state. Managers also hold on to wages to discourage defections. The women have been warned, Kim added, that if they try to defect “they will be immediately caught by Chinese CCTV cameras installed everywhere.” This past October, Chinese authorities repatriated around six hundred North Korean defectors. “China does not recognize North Korean defectors as refugees,” Edward Howell, who teaches politics at Oxford University, told me. “If they are caught by Chinese authorities, they will be forcibly returned to the D.P.R.K., where they face harsh punishment in labor camps.”</p></div></div><div><p>Chinese companies have significant incentives to use North Korean workers. They’re typically paid only a quarter of what local employees earn. And they are generally excluded from mandatory social-welfare programs (regarding retirement, medical treatment, work-related injury, and maternity), which further reduces costs. In 2017, Dandong’s Commerce Bureau announced a plan to create a cluster of garment factories that would use North Korean labor. The bureau’s Web site noted that all such workers undergo political screenings to make sure they are “rooted, red, and upright.” “The discipline among the workers is extremely strong,” it added. “There are no instances of absenteeism or insubordination toward leadership, and there are no occurrences of feigning illness or delaying work.” China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to questions for this piece, but last year the Chinese Ambassador to the U.N. wrote that China has abided by sanctions even though it has sustained “great losses” as a result. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently said that China and North Korea have “enjoyed long-standing friendly ties,” adding, “The United States needs to draw lessons, correct course, step up to its responsibility, stop heightening the pressure and sanctions, stop military deterrence, and take effective steps to resume meaningful dialogue.”</p><p>North Koreans face difficult circumstances across industries. In January of this year, more than two thousand workers rioted in Jilin Province, breaking sewing machines and kitchen utensils, when they learned that their wages would be withheld. Many North Koreans—perhaps thousands—work in Russian logging, in brutal winter weather without proper clothing. Hundreds have been found working in the Russian construction industry; some lived in shipping containers or in the basements of buildings under construction, because better accommodations were not provided. One recounted working shifts that lasted from 7:30 <small>A</small>.<small>M</small>. to 3 <small>A</small>.<small>M</small>. In preparation for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, held in Russia and Qatar, thousands of North Koreans were sent to build stadiums and luxury apartments. A subcontractor who worked alongside the North Koreans in Russia told the <em>Guardian</em> that they lived in cramped spaces, with as many as eight people packed into a trailer, in an atmosphere of fear and abuse like “prisoners of war.”</p></div><div><div><figure><figcaption><p><span>At Donggang Haimeng, last year, several hundred workers, many of whom were North Korean, stood shoulder to shoulder at long metal tables under harsh lights.

Some eighty per cent of seafood consumed in America, for example, is imported, and much of it comes from China through opaque supply chains. To trace the importation of seafood from factories that appear to be using North Korean labor, my team reviewed trade data, shipping contracts, and the codes that are stamped on seafood packages to monitor food safety. We found that, since 2017, ten of these plants have together shipped more than a hundred and twenty thousand tons of seafood to more than seventy American importers, which supplied grocery stores including Walmart, Giant, ShopRite, and the online grocer Weee! The seafood from these importers also ended up at major restaurant chains, like McDonald’s, and with Sysco, the largest food distributor in the world, which supplies almost half a million restaurants, as well as the cafeterias on American military bases, in public schools, and for the U.S. Congress. (Walmart, Weee!, and McDonald’s did not respond to requests for comment. Giant’s parent company, Ahold Delhaize, and ShopRite’s parent company, Wakefern, said their suppliers claimed that they currently do not source from the Chinese plant in question, and added that audit reports showed no evidence of forced labor.)</p><p>Two of the plants that investigators from my team visited—Dandong Galicia Seafood and Dalian Haiqing Food—had an estimated fifty to seventy North Korean workers apiece. One worker who has been employed at Galicia said that the managers are “so stingy with money that they don’t allow us to get proper medical treatment even when we are sick.” Galicia and Haiqing have shipped roughly a hundred thousand tons of seafood to American importers since 2017, and Haiqing also shipped to an importer that supplies the cafeterias of the European Parliament. (Dalian Haiqing Food said that it “does not employ overseas North Korean workers.” Dandong Galicia Seafood did not respond to requests for comment. One of the U.S. importers tied to Haiqing, Trident Seafoods, said that audits “found no evidence or even suspicion” of North Korean labor at the plant. Several companies, including Trident, High Liner, and Sysco, said that they would sever ties with the plant while they conducted their own investigations. A spokesperson for the European Parliament said that its food contractor did not supply seafood from the plant.) Breuker, from Leiden University, told me that American customers quietly benefit from this arrangement. “This labor-transfer system is for North Korea and China as economically successful as it is morally reprehensible,” he said. “It’s also a boon for the West because of the cheap goods we get as a result.”</p><p>North Korea doesn’t just export seafood workers; it also exports fish—another means by which the government secures foreign currency. Importing North Korean seafood is forbidden by U.N. sanctions, but it also tends to be inexpensive, which encourages companies to skirt the rules. Sometimes Chinese fishing companies pay the North Korean government for illegal licenses to fish in North Korea’s waters. Sometimes they buy fish from other boats at sea: a letter from a North Korean, leaked in 2022, proposed selling ten thousand tons of squid to a Chinese company in return for more than eighteen million dollars and five hundred tons of diesel fuel. Sometimes the seafood is trucked over the border. This trade is poorly hidden. In October, a Chinese man who said his last name was Cui posted a video on Douyin advertising crabs from North Korea. When someone commented, “The goods can’t be shipped,” Cui responded with laughing emojis. In other videos, he explained that he operated a processing plant in North Korea, and gave information on the timing of shipments that he planned to send across the border. When I contacted Cui, he said that he had stopped importing North Korean seafood in 2016 (though the videos were actually from last year), and added, “It’s none of your business, and I don’t care who you are.” My team found that seafood from North Korea was imported by several American distributors, including HF Foods, which supplies more than fifteen thousand Asian restaurants in the U.S. (HF Foods did not respond to requests for comment.)</p></div></div><div><p>Chinese companies often claim that they are in compliance with labor laws because they have passed “social audits,” which are conducted by firms that inspect worksites for abuses. But half the Chinese plants that we found using North Korean workers have certifications from the Marine Stewardship Council, which is based in the U.K. and sets standards for granting sustainability certifications, but only to companies that have also passed social audits or other labor assessments. (Jackie Marks, an M.S.C. spokesperson, told me that these social audits are conducted by a third party, and that “We make no claims about setting standards on labor.”) Last year, one of my team’s investigators visited a seafood-processing plant in northeastern China called Dandong Taifeng Foodstuff. The company has been designated a “national brand,” a status reserved for the country’s most successful companies, and supplies thousands of tons of seafood to grocery stores in the U.S. and elsewhere. At the plant, our investigator was given a tour by a North Korean manager. On the factory floor, which was lit by bright fluorescent bulbs, more than a hundred and fifty North Korean women, most of them under thirty-five years old, wore head-to-toe white protective clothing, plastic aprons, white rubber boots, and red gloves that went up to their elbows. They stood with their heads down, moving red, yellow, and blue plastic bins of seafood. Water puddled at their feet. “Quick, quick,” one woman said to the other members of her small group. (Taifeng did not respond to requests for comment.) Just weeks after that visit, the plant was recertified by the Marine Stewardship Council.</p><p>Marcus Noland, who works at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said, of social audits within the seafood industry, “The basic stance appears to be ‘See no evil.’&nbsp;” Skepticism of such audits is growing. In 2021, the U.S. State Department said that social audits in China are generally inadequate for identifying forced labor, in part because auditors rely on government translators and rarely speak directly to workers. Auditors can be reluctant to anger the companies that have hired them, and workers face reprisals for reporting abuses. This past November, U.S. Customs and Border Protection advised American companies that a credible assessment would require an “unannounced independent, third-party audit” and “interviews completed in native language.” Liana Foxvog, who works at a nonprofit called the Worker Rights Consortium, argues that assessments should involve other checks too, including off-site worker interviews. But she noted that most audits in China fall short even of C.B.P.’s standards.</p><p>Joshua Stanton, an attorney based in Washington, D.C., who helped draft the American law that banned goods produced with North Korean labor, argues that the government is not doing enough to enforce it. “The U.S. government will need to put more pressure on American companies, and those companies need to be more diligent about their suppliers and their supply chains, or face stricter sanctions,” he said. Chris Smith, a Republican congressman from New Jersey and a specialist on China, noted that social audits “create a Potemkin village.” He added, “The consequence is that millions of dollars, even federal dollars, are going to Chinese plants using North Korean workers, and that money then goes right into the hands of Kim Jong Un’s regime, which uses the money to arm our adversaries and repress its own people.”</p></div><div><div><p><em>Late last year</em>, when I set out to contact North Koreans who had been sent to China, I ran into significant obstacles. Western journalists are barred from entering North Korea, and citizens of the country are strictly prohibited from talking freely to reporters. I hired a team of investigators in South Korea who employ contacts in North Korea to get information out of the country for local and Western news outlets—for example, about food shortages, power outages, or the rise of anti-government graffiti. The investigators compiled a list of two dozen North Koreans who had been dispatched to a half-dozen different Chinese factories, most of whom had since returned home. The investigators’ contacts then met with these workers in secret, one-on-one, so that the workers wouldn’t know one another’s identity. The meetings usually occurred in open fields, or on the street, where it’s harder for security agents to conduct surveillance.</p><p>The workers were told that their responses would be shared publicly by an American journalism outlet. They faced considerable risk speaking out; experts told me that, if they were caught, they could be executed, and their families put in prison camps. But they agreed to talk because they believe that it is important for the rest of the world to know what happens to workers who are sent to China. The North Korean contacts transcribed their answers by hand, and then took photos of the completed questionnaires and sent them, using encrypted phones, to the investigators, who sent them to me. North Koreans who are still in China were interviewed in a similar fashion. Because of these layers of protection, it is, of course, impossible to fully verify the content of the interviews. But the responses were reviewed by experts to make sure that they are consistent with what is broadly known about the work-transfer program, and in line with interviews given by North Korean defectors. (Recently, the investigators checked in on the interviewers and interviewees, and everyone was safe.)</p></div><div><p>Transcribed interviews with North Korean workers. Portions have been blurred to protect sources.
</p><div><div><blockquote><p>“At first, I almost vomited at how bad it was, and, just when I got used to it, the supervisors would tell us to shut up, and curse if we talked.
”</p></blockquote></div><div><blockquote><p>“They called me in as if something happened in the room, and then coerced me into sex. They threatened me that, if I don’t comply, then they will send me back, or they will take out money from my living expenses.
”</p></blockquote></div><div><blockquote><p>“Earning money was good, but I kept thinking about the sexual assault and it was driving me crazy.
”</p></blockquote></div><div><blockquote><p>“They would say I’m fuckable and then suddenly grab my body and grope my breasts and put their dirty mouth on mine and be disgusting.
”</p></blockquote></div><div><blockquote><p>“Sixty to seventy per cent are depressed. We regretted coming to China but couldn’t go back empty-handed.
”</p></blockquote></div></div></div><div><p>In their answers, the workers described crushing loneliness. The work was arduous, the factories smelled, and violence was common. “They kicked us and treated us as subhuman,” the worker who processed clams in Dandong said. Asked if they could recount any happy moments, most said that there had been none. A few said that they felt relieved when they returned home and got some of their pay. “I was happy when the money wasn’t all taken out,” the woman who did product transport in Dalian said. One woman said that her experience at a Chinese plant made her feel like she “wanted to die.” Another said that she often felt tired and upset while she was working, but kept those thoughts to herself to avoid reprisals. “It was lonely,” she said. “I hated the military-like communal life.”</p><p>The most striking pattern was the women’s description of sexual abuse. Of twenty workers, seventeen said that they had been sexually assaulted by their North Korean managers. They described a range of tactics used to coerce them into having sex. Some managers pretended to wipe something from their uniforms, only to grope them. Some called them into their offices as if there were an emergency, then demanded sex. Others asked them to serve alcohol at a weekend party, then assaulted them there. “When they drank, they touched my body everywhere like playing with toys,” a woman said. The woman who did product transport in Dalian said, “When they suddenly put their mouths to mine, I wanted to throw up.” If the women didn’t comply, the managers could become violent. The worker who was at Haiqing for more than four years said, of her manager, “When he doesn’t get his way sexually, he gets angry and kicks me. . . . He calls me a ‘fucking bitch.’ ” Three of the women said that their managers had forced workers into prostitution. “Whenever they can, they flirt with us to the point of nausea and force us to have sex for money, and it’s even worse if you’re pretty,” another worker at Haiqing said. The worker from Jinhui noted, “Even when there was no work during the pandemic, the state demanded foreign-currency funds out of loyalty, so managers forced workers to sell their bodies.” The worker who spent more than four years at Haiqing said, of the managers, “They forced virgin workers into prostitution, claiming that they had to meet state-set quotas.”</p><p>The pandemic made life more difficult for many of the women. When China closed its borders, some found themselves trapped far from home. Often, their workplaces shut down, and they lost their incomes. North Korean workers sometimes pay bribes to government officials to secure posts in China, and, during the pandemic, many borrowed these funds from loan sharks. The loans, typically between two and three thousand dollars, came with high interest rates. Because of work stoppages in China, North Korean workers were unable to pay back their loans, and loan sharks sent thugs to their relatives’ homes to intimidate them. Some of their families had to sell their houses to settle the debts. In 2023, according to Radio Free Asia, two North Korean women at textile plants killed themselves. The worker who told me that she wanted to die said that such deaths are often kept hidden. “If someone dies from suicide, then the manager is responsible, so they keep it under wraps to keep it from being leaked to other workers or Chinese people,” she said.</p></div></div><div><p>This past year, pandemic restrictions were lifted, and the border between China and North Korea reopened. In August, some three hundred North Korean workers boarded ten buses in Dandong to go back home. Police officers lined up around the buses to prevent defections. In photos and a video of the event, some of the women can be seen hurriedly preparing to load large suitcases onto a neon-green bus, then riding away across the Friendship Bridge. In September, another three hundred boarded a passenger train to Sinuiju, and two hundred were repatriated by plane. Workers who return face intense questioning by officials. “They asked about every single thing that happened every day from morning to evening in China, about other workers, supervisors, and agents,” the worker who processed clams in Dandong explained. As 2023 ended, the North Korean government began planning to dispatch its next wave of workers. In the past couple of years, according to reporting by Hyemin Son, a North Korean defector who works for Radio Free Asia, labor brokers have requested that Chinese companies pay a large advance; they were being asked to pay ahead of time, one broker told her, because “Chinese companies cannot operate without North Korean manpower.”</p><p>Some North Korean workers have yet to go home. One woman said that she has spent the past several years gutting fish at a processing plant in Dalian. She described working late into the night and getting sores in her mouth from stress and exhaustion. In the questionnaire, I had asked about the worst part of her job, and she said, “When I am forced to have sex.” She also described a sense of imprisonment that felt suffocating. “If you show even the slightest attitude, they will treat you like an insect,” she said. “Living a life where we can’t see the outside world as we please is so difficult that it’s killing us.” ♦</p><p><em>This piece was produced with contributions from Joe Galvin, Maya Martin, Susan Ryan, Jake Conley, Austin Brush, and Daniel Murphy.</em></p><div><h3>More on China’s Seafood Industry

            <p>What will be the end of Windows? Microsoft.</p>
<p>I’ve been a lifelong Windows user since the 90s and even MS-DOS back in the 80s, but things are changing. I’ve been using other operating systems more and more. MacOS and Linux are getting mixed into my workflow more and Windows less. Why? Microsoft is actively angering it power users by removing features. By trying to simplify Windows they are actively making administering it worse.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>Microsoft is in a panic from the continued loss of it’s user base. They are making some improvements like the GUI and cleaning up other elements that give a more cohesive look. No more mixing Metro UI and Legacy panels like Windows 10. While this is good on the surface, they aren’t fixing anything. In fact, things are about to get much worse with the removal of these panels. On Tuesday, I had a printer issue at a client site and I was going to pull up the “Devices and Printers” panel to manage the drives and printing default settings. In the most recent 22H2 Windows 11 update, they hid it!</p>
<p>Using old Control Panel (Start-&gt;Run-&gt;<code>control</code>)</p>
<p>Clicking on this will redirect you to the new settings printer that gives NO options to do any advanced troubleshooting and removes the ability to FIX the issue!</p>
<p>What about the old <code>control printers</code> shortcut? remapped to the new crap.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>With any Windows problem, Microsoft never really removes ANYTHING! Remember, this company is still using legacy code from the 90s in spots and just slapping in new coat of paint on top of it every 5 years when they need to extract more money from its users.</p>
<p>To Access the old devices and printer use the run prompt and type the following:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>shell:::{A8A91A66-3A7D-4424-8D24-04E180695C7A}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Alternatively, you can create a new shortcut and assign the key combination to it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new shortcut on your desktop</li>
<li>Set the location to: explorer.exe shell:::{A8A91A66-3A7D-4424-8D24-04E180695C7A}</li>
<li>Set the name to Devices and Printers</li>
<li>Choose the shortcut icon</li>
<li>Add the key combination shortcut (CTRL + ALT + D is default for this window)</li>
</ul>
<p>This provides you an easy to access link as well as overwriting the keyboard shortcut to open the old version.</p>
<p>Success for now…</p>
<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>
<p>MacOS and Linux will keep gaining market share. Microsoft needs to stop actively sabotaging it’s users. MacOS is bland and hasn’t changed in years, while Linux has a technical barrier of entry with little support. Yet, both of these options are better than modern Windows unless you need Gaming. However, Steam with it’s steamdeck might be changing the game…</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<p>
Pleasures
<br>
<i>by Aldous Huxley</i>
</p>


<p>We have heard a great deal, since 1914,
about the things which are a menace
to civilization. First it was Prussian militarism;
then the Germans at large; then the
prolongation of the war; then the shortening
of the same; then, after a time, the Treaty of
Versailles; then French militarism - with, all
the while, a running accompaniment of such
minor menaces as Prohibition, Lord Northcliffe,
Mr. Bryan, Comstockery....</p>

<p>Civilization, however, has resisted the
combined attacks of these enemies wonderfully
well. For still, in 1923, it stands not
so very far from where it stood in that "giant
age before the flood" of nine years since.
Where, in relation to Neanderthal on the
one hand and Athens on the other, where
precisely it stood <i>then</i> is a question which
each may answer according to his taste. The
important fact is that these menaces to our
civilization, such as it is - menaces including
the largest war and the stupidest peace known
to history - have confined themselves in most
places and up till now to mere threats, barking
more furiously than they bite.</p>

<p>No, the dangers which confront our civilization
are not so much the external dangers - wild
men, wars and the bankruptcy that
wars bring after them. The most alarming
dangers are those which menace it from
within, that threaten the mind rather
than the body and estate of contemporary
man.</p>

<p>Of all the various poisons which modern
civilization, by a process of auto-intoxication,
brews quietly up within its own bowels,
few, it seems to me, are more deadly (while
none appears more harmless) than that curious
and appalling thing that is technically
known as "pleasure." "Pleasure" (I place
the word between inverted commas to show
that I mean, not real pleasure, but the organized
activities officially known by the same
name) "pleasure" - what nightmare visions
the word evokes! Like every man of sense
and good feeling, I abominate work. But I
would rather put in eight hours a day at a
Government office than be condemned to lead
a life of "pleasure"; I would even, I believe,
prefer to write a million words of journalism
a year.</p>

<p>The horrors of modern "pleasure" arise
from the fact that every kind of organized
distraction tends to become progressively
more and more imbecile. There was a time
when people indulged themselves with distractions
requiring the expense of a certain
intellectual effort. In the seventeenth century,
for example, royal personages and their
courtiers took a real delight in listening to
erudite sermons (Dr. Donne's, for example)
and academical disputes on points of theology
or metaphysics. Part of the entertainment
offered to the Prince Palatine, on the
occasion of his marriage with James 1.'s
daughter, was a syllogistic argumentation, on
I forget what philosophical theme, between
the amiable Lord Keeper Williams and a
troop of minor Cambridge logicians. Imagine
the feelings of a contemporary prince,
if a loyal University were to offer him a
similar entertainment!</p>

<p>Royal personages were not the only people
who enjoyed intelligent pleasures. In Elizabethan
times every lady and gentleman of
ordinary culture could be relied upon, at demand,
to take his or her part in a madrigal
or a motet. Those who know the enormous
complexity and subtlety of sixteenth-century
music will realize what this means. To indulge
in their favourite pastime our ancestors
had to exert their minds to an uncommon
degree. Even the uneducated vulgar delighted
in pleasures requiring the exercise of
a certain intelligence, individuality and personal
initiative. They listened, for example,
to <i>Othello</i>, <i>King Lear</i>, and <i>Hamlet</i> - apparently
with enjoyment and comprehension.
They sang and made much music. And far
away, in the remote country, the peasants,
year by year, went through the traditional
rites - the dances of spring and summer, the
winter mummings, the ceremonies of harvest
home - appropriate to each successive season.
Their pleasures were intelligent and alive,
and it was they who, by their own efforts,
entertained themselves.</p>

<p>We have changed all that. In place of
the old pleasures demanding intelligence and
personal initiative, we have vast organizations
that provide us with ready-made distractions - distractions
which demand from
pleasure-seekers no personal participation
and no intellectual effort of any sort. To
the interminable democracies of the world a
million cinemas bring the same stale balderdash.
There have always been fourth-rate
writers and dramatists; but their works, in
the past, quickly died without getting beyond
the boundaries of the city or the country in
which they appeared. To-day, the inventions
of the scenario-writer go out from Los
Angeles across the whole world. Countless
audiences soak passively in the tepid bath of
nonsense. No mental effort is demanded of
them, no participation; they need only sit
and keep their eyes open.</p>

<p>Do the democracies want music? In the
old days they would have made it themselves.
Now, they merely turn on the gramophone.
Or if they are a little more up-to-date they
adjust their wireless telephone to the right
wave-length and listen-in to the fruity contralto
at Marconi House, singing "The
Gleaner's Slumber Song."</p>

<p>And if they want literature, there is the
Press. Nominally, it is true, the Press exists
to impart information. But its real function
is to provide, like the cinema, a distraction
which shall occupy the mind without demanding
of it the slightest effort or the fatigue
of a single thought. This function, it
must be admitted, it fulfils with an extraordinary
success. It is possible to go on
for years and years, reading two papers every
working day and one on Sundays without
ever once being called upon to think or to
make any other effort than to move the eyes,
not very attentively, down the printed
column.</p>

<p>Certain sections of the community still
practise athletic sports in which individual
participation is demanded. Great numbers
of the middle and upper classes play golf
and tennis in person and, if they are sufficiently
rich, shoot birds and pursue the fox
and go ski-ing in the Alps. But the vast mass
of the community has now come even to
sport vicariously, preferring the watching of
football to the fatigues and dangers of the
actual game. All classes, it is true, still
dance; but dance, all the world over, the
same steps to the same tunes. The dance has
been scrupulously sterilized of any local or
personal individuality.</p>

<p>These effortless pleasures, these ready-made
distractions that are the same for every
one over the face of the whole Western world,
are surely a worse menace to our civilization
than ever the Germans were. The working
hours of the day are already, for the great
majority of human beings, occupied in the
performance of purely mechanical tasks in
which no mental effort, no individuality, no
initiative are required. And now, in the
hours of leisure, we turn to distractions as
mechanically stereotyped and demanding as
little intelligence and initiative as does our
work. Add such leisure to such work and
the sum is a perfect day which it is a blessed
relief to come to the end of.</p>

<p>Self-poisoned in this fashion, civilization
looks as though it might easily decline into
a kind of premature senility. With a mind
almost atrophied by lack of use, unable to
entertain itself and grown so wearily uninterested
in the ready-made distractions offered
from without that nothing but the
grossest stimulants of an ever-increasing violence
and crudity can move it, the democracy
of the future will sicken of a chronic
and mortal boredom. It will go, perhaps,
the way the Romans went: the Romans who
came at last to lose, precisely as we are doing
now, the capacity to distract themselves;
the Romans who, like us, lived on ready-made
entertainments in which they had no
participation. Their deadly ennui demanded
ever more gladiators, more tightrope-walking
elephants, more rare and far-fetched
animals to be slaughtered. Ours would demand
no less; but owing to the existence of
a few idealists, doesn't get all it asks for.
The most violent forms of entertainment can
only be obtained illicitly. Let us not
despair, however; we may still live to see
blood flowing across the stage of the Hippodrome.
The force of a boredom clamouring
to be alleviated may yet prove too much
for the idealists.</p>

SVG content itself can’t have 3D transforms applied to it, but HTML inside of a <code>foreignObject</code> in the SVG can! Note that inside of the console the built-in depth sorting doesn’t seem to work in Chrome so I had to apply <code>z-index</code> to the appropriate sides to make this cube visualization work (another alternative would be to only use borders so you can’t tell the depth sorting is off):</p><p>So, what are some things that we can make given these capabilities and limitations?

To do so, you can paste the part inside of the ticks (<code>`</code>) into <a href="https://codepen.io/ZachSaucier/pen/KKJOJWR">this CodePen</a>, optionally copying the result back into the CSS section and having CodePen format the result for you.</p><p>Here’s my first attempt at adding animation to the console that I created for <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/blog/">my personal blog</a>:</p><p>What would a post exploring a new animation technique be without a horse-running animation?

</div><p>Here’s an example to show that you can use JavaScript to switch out the text of the SVG (using <code>.textContent</code>, not <code>.innerText</code> since it’s an SVG element). With that being said, you can’t do something like a scramble text effect due to the limitation around using <code>setInterval</code> and <code>requestAnimationFrame</code><sup data-fn="621356bc-ae4e-4d36-8dba-c6293f976027"><a href="#621356bc-ae4e-4d36-8dba-c6293f976027" id="621356bc-ae4e-4d36-8dba-c6293f976027-link">6</a></sup>.</p><p>However, we <em>can</em> swap out the text (or any elements) after the start if we use an SVG along with CSS animations! To do so you have to include the content in the original SVG and use CSS keyframes.</p><p>The above technique can be used to create a stop motion effect or make words and/or elements appear “randomly” around the console (you might want to <a href="https://codepen.io/ZachSaucier/pen/zYegbPB??editors=1000">use JavaScript</a> or a pre-processor to help you generate this sort of thing). For example, here’s a some random circles that disappear and appear:</p><p>It’s impossible to add click events or links inside of the SVG that’s used as a background image. However, if you’re fine showing the full URL, you can fake it by using carefully chosen padding values to place the URL from the console message where you want it to be relative to the background image. It might also be worth changing the&nbsp;<code>font-family</code>&nbsp;being used to more closely match the SVG that you&nbsp;use.</p><p>Keep in mind that the URL itself will affect the width of the element, so you may need to adjust your SVG. Also, make sure to test thoroughly between browsers because there are more cross-browser inconsistencies with this technique.</p><p>In Safari, it only shows the link and not the background&nbsp;image.</p><p>Unfortunately, I couldn’t find a way to make the message span 100% of the width of the console. I believe that this is because we can’t change the display of elements in the console, so things like width: 100% don’t work here. The element must have an explicit width and height in pixels (or other non-relative unit), or else its size will be based on the text.</p><p>I did notice that <code>console.table(['foo'])</code> spans the whole width, but we’re unable to use CSS styling on console tables as far as I know.</p><p>In the future, I hope browsers will add a responsive width element in the console.</p><p>Reveal animations (like the first half of the line-drawing animation above) are one way of animating using this technique. However, these animations may finish before someone actually opens up the console. As such, I wanted to see if we can detect when the console is open so that we can wait to fire the animation until then.</p><p>To my knowledge, there’s no way to detect if the console itself is open (if you know of a way, please let me know!). However, there are some ways to detect if the DevTools in general are open, though the method <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/7798748/2065702">seems to change every so often</a>.</p><p>I got the lightweight package <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/devtools-detect">devtools-detect</a> working in a project using <a href="https://gist.github.com/ZachSaucier/ea8ebf65079febbde4f2f9190ae6644a">this sort of setup</a>. However, the package has many known issues, which the author notes in the README. But for the purpose of something superfluous like this it is probably okay. If you’re really wanting to do this, I might recommend <a href="https://github.com/david-fong/detect-devtools-via-debugger-heartstop">detect-devtools-via-debugger-heartstop</a> instead because it seems more reliable but I didn’t test it myself.</p><p>With that being said, you may want to use a looping or ambient (constantly running) animation so you make sure that your user sees the hard work you’ve invested.</p><p>I tried getting a sense of the performance impact by running the most intense animation that I provided as an example, the horse animation from the example section above, and looking at my Activity Monitor.</p><p>When the console was open and the animation was running, the “Google Chrome Helper (GPU)” went up to around 80% on my 2018 Macbook Pro. With any other devtools tab open instead or with the dev tools closed, I could not see any measurable impact on any process.</p><p>This indicates that this sort of effect should not have much of an impact on your page unless someone has their devtools console open.</p><p>With that being said, always do your own testing, including on a wider range of devices, to make sure it’s not a detriment to any user’s experience.</p><p>Note: Using consoles in this way is very experimental and these results are likely to be inaccurate at some point in the future. As far as I can tell, styles in the console using <code>%c</code> like this <a href="https://console.spec.whatwg.org/#logger">is mentioned</a> in a spec but not fleshed out.</p><p>Firefox fails to set the proper height of the background image and cuts off the SVG a bit:</p><p>It seems like for Firefox you have to basically double the height: use the height for the <code>line-height</code> then use half the height for the <code>padding-block</code>. The downside of doing this is that it adds a bit of extra white space at the bottom of the SVGs in Chrome and Edge. In order to have this effect look significantly better in Firefox, I think this is worth the tradeoff but I also hope that Firefox can address this issue. If you have figured out a way to get around this issue, please let me know!</p><p>Additionally, Firefox has a significantly shorter character limit for console messages, so ones like the horse animation above don’t render anything in Firefox.</p><p>So long as you’re not trying to align other text with an SVG, you can drop the <code>vertical-align: middle</code> which makes the Chrome &amp; Edge version a bit better.</p><p>Safari is the only major browser that doesn’t support this sort of thing (per usual). It just prints the raw text and ignores the CSS:</p><p>It <em>does</em> have some limited CSS support for console messages though, just not enough for the more complex CSS and background images. Hopefully this article can encourage them to improve their support!</p><p>All in all, since this technique acts like progressive enhancement and is basically an easter egg, I would be happy to ship something like this in production code at any company. I think you should too!</p><p><a href="https://css-doodle.com/#function-@shape">css-doodle</a> is a library similar to <a href="https://p5js.org/">P5.js</a> and the like. It specializes in HTML + CSS + SVG creations (though recently it’s gotten support for GLSL shaders). This makes it a perfect for creating effects for the console! It’s created by <a href="https://yuanchuan.dev/">Chuan</a> (<a href="https://vis.social/@yuanchuan">@yuanchuan</a>). Note that it’s still fairly early on in its development and not everything about it is documented!</p><p>I could write several articles on <code>css-doodle</code>, but for the purpose of this article I will keep it short:</p><p>You can create some nice-looking console messages without using SVGs or anything like that. For example, you can apply multiple <code>text-shadows</code> to apply a 3D text effect:</p><p>A similar effect that has been explored more is ASCII art in the console. For example, the fairly well-known Reddit <code>console.log</code> art / ad:</p><p>Note the usage of <code>font-family: monospace</code> to make sure the characters have a consistent width.</p><p>Emojis work well in the console. Sometimes, that may be all you&nbsp;need!</p><p>I’m hoping that this article inspires developers and companies to implement delightful console surprises. I think it should become a normal addition to a website!</p></div>]]></description>

<p><em>The best way you can contribute to an open source project is to remove lines of code from it.</em>
<em>We should endeavor to write code that a novice programmer can easily
understand without explanation or that a maintainer can understand without
significant time investment.</em></p>
<p>As students we attempt increasingly challenging problems with increasingly
sophisticated technologies.  We first learn loops, then functions, then
classes, etc..  We are praised as we ascend this hierarchy, writing longer
programs with more advanced technology.  We learn that experienced programmers
use monads while new programmers use for loops.</p>
<p>Then we graduate and find a job or open source project to work on with others.
We search for something that we can add, and implement a solution pridefully,
using the all the tricks that we learned in school.</p>
<p><em>Ah ha! I can extend this project to do X!  And I can use inheritance here!  Excellent!</em></p>
<p>We implement this feature and feel accomplished, and with good reason.
Programming in real systems is no small accomplishment.  This was certainly my
experience.  I was excited to write code and proud that I could show off all of
the things that I knew how to do to the world.  As evidence of my historical
love of programming technology, here is a <a href="https://github.com/mrocklin/matrix-algebra">linear algebra
language</a> built with a another
meta-programming language.  Notice that no one has touched this code in several
years.</p>
<p>However after maintaining code a bit more I now think somewhat differently.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>We should not seek to build software.  Software is the currency that we pay
to solve problems, which is our actual goal.  We should endeavor to build
as little software as possible to solve our problems.</p></li>
<li><p>We should use technologies that are as simple as possible, so that as many
people as possible can use and extend them without needing to understand
our advanced techniques.  We should use advanced techniques only when we
are not smart enough to figure out how to use more common techniques.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Neither of these points are novel.  Most people I meet agree with them to some
extent, but somehow we forget them when we go to contribute to a new project.
The instinct to <em>contribute by building</em> and to <em>demonstrate sophistication</em>
often take over.</p>
<section id="software-is-a-cost">
<h2>Software is a cost<a href="#software-is-a-cost" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Every line that you write costs people time.  It costs you time to write it of
course, but you are willing to make this personal sacrifice.  However this code
also costs the reviewers their time to understand it.  It costs future
maintainers and developers their time as they fix and modify your code.  They
could be spending this time outside in the sunshine or with their family.</p>
<p>So when you add code to a project you should feel meek.  It should feel as
though you are eating with your family and there isn’t enough food on the
table.  You should take only what you need and no more.  The people with you
will respect you for your efforts to restrict yourself.  Solving problems with
less code is a hard, but it is a burden that you take on yourself to lighten
the burdens of others.</p>
</section>
<section id="complex-technologies-are-harder-to-maintain">
<h2>Complex technologies are harder to maintain<a href="#complex-technologies-are-harder-to-maintain" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>As students, we demonstrate merit by using increasingly advanced technologies.
Our measure of worth depends on our ability to use functions, then classes,
then higher order functions, then monads, etc. in public projects.  We show off
our solutions to our peers and feel pride or shame according to our
sophistication.</p>
<p>However when working with a team to solve problems in the world the situation
is reversed.  Now we strive to solve problems with code that is as simple as
possible.  When we solve a problem simply we enable junior programmers to
extend our solution to solve other problems.  Simple code enables others and
boosts our impact.  We demonstrate our value by solving hard problems with only
basic techniques.</p>
<p><em>Look! I replaced this recursive function with a for loop and it still does
everything that we need it to.  I know it’s not as clever, but I noticed that
the interns were having trouble with it and I thought that this change might
help.</em></p>
<p>If you are a good programmer then you don’t need to demonstrate that you know
cool tricks.  Instead, you can demonstrate your value by solving a problem in a
simple way that enables everyone on your team to contribute in the future.</p>
</section>
<section id="but-moderation-of-course">
<h2>But moderation, of course<a href="#but-moderation-of-course" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>That being said, over-adherence to the “build things with simple tools” dogma
can be counter productive.  Often a recursive solution can be much simpler than
a for-loop solution and often times using a Class or a Monad is the right
approach.  But we should be mindful when using these technologies that we are
building for ourselves our own system; a system with which others have had no
experience.</p>
