<p>It all started with this toot from <a href="https://cloudisland.nz/web/accounts/1">Aurynn</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>do I just need to put one screen in portrait mode?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the past I had experimented with using portrait displays for reading and programming. The ability to display large amount of text is certainly appealing.</p>
<h3 id="boring">Boring</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sprocketfox.io/xssfox/images/PXL_20211202_034116753.jpg" alt="Monitor in portrait mode">
    <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But is this the most optimal display for software development? Lets evaluate</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Rotation</th>
<th>Advantages</th>
<th>Disadvantages</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0°</td>
<td>Works with most applications. Video content is usually in wide format</td>
<td>Websites and documents usually end up with a lot of whitespace and padding around them</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>90°</td>
<td>Great for text documents - can read down like a book page</td>
<td>Movies don’t display well. Viewing angle problems</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Here you might think we might done. But there are soooooo many more angles we can try. This is a little tricky on macOS and Windows but on Linux we have all the freedom we need.</p>
<h3 id="odd-but-ok">Odd but ok.</h3>
<p>We have a little tool called <code>xrandr</code> (x resize and rotate). We can use it to rotate the screen around to any angle we want. In practice I couldn’t get this to work on my MacBook. My desktop on the otherhand it had no problems. So lets try a few out.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sprocketfox.io/xssfox/images/PXL_20211202_034333303.jpg" alt="Monitor with a 1 degree rotation">
    <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>1° - notice the menu bar disappearing to the right</p>
</blockquote>
<figure>
    <img src="https://sprocketfox.io/xssfox/images/PXL_20211202_034744788.jpg" alt="Monitor with a 45 degree rotation">
    <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>45° - I run out of space</p>
</blockquote>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Rotation</th>
<th>Advantages</th>
<th>Disadvantages</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1°</td>
<td>Handy if your desk is on a slight slope</td>
<td>fonts render a little weird</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>45°</td>
<td>Middle ground between vertical and horizontal</td>
<td>doesn’t fit well with non square aspect ratios</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>One neat thing about 45° is that it gives us pretty close to the diagonal. But not on my ultra wide. Due to maths, the amount we’d need to rotate is based on the angle of a triangle which match the aspect ration of the screen we are using. This ends up being about 22° for a 21:9 ratio.</p>
<h3 id="the-perfect-rotation">The perfect rotation</h3>
<figure>

<tr>
<th>Rotation</th>
<th>Advantages</th>
<th>Disadvantages</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>22°</td>
<td>Longest line length!</td>
<td>Webcam starts sliding away</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So this here I think is the best monitor orientation for software development. It provides the longest line lengths and no longer need to worry about that pesky 80 column limit.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-do-this">How do I do this?</h3>
<p>First off, I could only get this to work in xorg - no wayland support yet. <code>xrandr --output HDMI-3 --transform lots of numbers here</code> takes a transformation matrix thats used to position the screen. We can use that to rotate the display.</p>
<p>The basic syntax that we need for rotating and shifting is this</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>cos(x),-sin(x),shift_left,sin(x),cos(x),shift_up,0,0,1
</code></pre><p>Some examples</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span><span># these won't shift / center the display as I don't know the resolution</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>#-0.1</span>
</span></span><span><span>xrandr --output HDMI-3 --transform 0.999998476913288,0.00174532836589831,0,-0.00174532836589831,0.999998476913288,0,0,0,1

<span>=== begin of license ===</span>

<span>VIM LICENSE</span><span id="_vim-license"></span>

I)  There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of Vim except
    that they <a href="https://vimhelp.org/vim_faq.txt.html#must">must</a> include this <a href="#license">license</a> text.  You can also distribute
    unmodified parts of Vim, likewise unrestricted except that they <a href="https://vimhelp.org/vim_faq.txt.html#must">must</a>
    include this <a href="#license">license</a> text.  You are also allowed to include executables
    that you made from the unmodified Vim sources, plus your own usage
    examples and Vim scripts.

II) It <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> allowed to distribute <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> modified (or extended) version of Vim,
    including executables and/or source code, when the following four
    conditions are met:
    1) This <a href="#license">license</a> text <a href="https://vimhelp.org/vim_faq.txt.html#must">must</a> be included unmodified.
    2) The modified Vim <a href="https://vimhelp.org/vim_faq.txt.html#must">must</a> be distributed in one of the following five ways:
       <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#a%29">a)</a> If you make changes to Vim yourself, you <a href="https://vimhelp.org/vim_faq.txt.html#must">must</a> clearly describe in
	  the <a href="https://vimhelp.org/intro.txt.html#distribution">distribution</a> how to contact you.  When the maintainer asks you
	  (in any way) for <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> copy of the modified Vim you distributed, you
	  <a href="https://vimhelp.org/vim_faq.txt.html#must">must</a> make your changes, including source code, available to the
	  maintainer without fee.  The maintainer reserves the right to
	  include your changes in the official version of Vim.  What the
	  maintainer will <a href="https://vimhelp.org/diff.txt.html#do">do</a> with your changes and under what <a href="#license">license</a> they
	  will be distributed <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> negotiable.  If there has been no negotiation
	  then this license, or <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> later version, also applies to your changes.
	  The current maintainers are listed here: <a href="https://github.com/orgs/vim/people">https://github.com/orgs/vim/people</a>.
	  If this changes <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#it">it</a> will be announced in appropriate places (most likely
	  vim.sf.net, www.vim.org and/or comp.editors).  When <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#it">it</a> <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> completely
	  impossible to contact the maintainer, the obligation to send him
	  your changes ceases.  Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has
	  received your changes they will not have to be sent again.
       b) If you have received <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> modified Vim that was distributed <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#as">as</a>
	  mentioned under <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#a%29">a)</a> you are allowed to further distribute <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#it">it</a>
	  unmodified, <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#as">as</a> mentioned <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#at">at</a> I).  If you make additional changes the
	  text under <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#a%29">a)</a> applies to those changes.
       c) Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy of
	  the modified Vim you distribute.  This may be done in the form of <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a>
	  context diff.  You can choose what <a href="#license">license</a> to use for new code you
	  add.  The changes and their <a href="#license">license</a> <a href="https://vimhelp.org/vim_faq.txt.html#must">must</a> not restrict others from
	  making their own changes to the official version of Vim.
       d) When you have <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> modified Vim which includes changes <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#as">as</a> mentioned
	  under c), you can distribute <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#it">it</a> without the source code for the
	  changes if the following three conditions are met:
	  <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#-">-</a> The <a href="#license">license</a> that applies to the changes permits you to distribute
	    the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or restriction, and
	    permits the Vim maintainer to include the changes in the official
	    version of Vim without fee or restriction.
	  <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#-">-</a> You keep the changes for <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#at">at</a> least three years after last
	    distributing the corresponding modified Vim.  When the maintainer
	    or someone who you distributed the modified Vim to asks you (in
	    any way) for the changes within this period, you <a href="https://vimhelp.org/vim_faq.txt.html#must">must</a> make them
	    available to him.
	  <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#-">-</a> You clearly describe in the <a href="https://vimhelp.org/intro.txt.html#distribution">distribution</a> how to contact you.  This
	    contact information <a href="https://vimhelp.org/vim_faq.txt.html#must">must</a> remain valid for <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#at">at</a> least three years
	    after last distributing the corresponding modified Vim, or <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#as">as</a> long
	    <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#as">as</a> possible.
       e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes,
	  you can distribute the modified Vim under the GNU GPL version 2 or
	  any later version.
    3) <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#A">A</a> message <a href="https://vimhelp.org/vim_faq.txt.html#must">must</a> be added, <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#at">at</a> least in the output of the "<a href="https://vimhelp.org/various.txt.html#%3Aversion">:version</a>"
       command and in the <a href="https://vimhelp.org/intro.txt.html#intro">intro</a> screen, such that the user of the modified Vim
       <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> able to see that <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#it">it</a> was modified.  When distributing <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#as">as</a> mentioned
       under 2)e) adding the message <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> only required for <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#as">as</a> far <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#as">as</a> this does
       not conflict with the <a href="#license">license</a> used for the changes.
    4) The contact information <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#as">as</a> required under 2)a) and 2)d) <a href="https://vimhelp.org/vim_faq.txt.html#must">must</a> not be
       removed or changed, except that the person himself can make
       corrections.

III) If you distribute <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to use
     the Vim <a href="#license">license</a> for your changes and make them available to the
     maintainer, including the source code.  The preferred way to <a href="https://vimhelp.org/diff.txt.html#do">do</a> this <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a>
     by e-mail or by uploading the files to <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> server and e-mailing the URL.
     If the number of changes <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> small (e.g., <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> modified Makefile) e-mailing <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a>
     context <a href="https://vimhelp.org/diff.txt.html#diff">diff</a> will do.  The e-mail address to be used <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a>
     &lt;maintainer@vim.org&gt;

IV)  It <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> not allowed to remove this <a href="#license">license</a> from the <a href="https://vimhelp.org/intro.txt.html#distribution">distribution</a> of the Vim
     sources, parts of <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#it">it</a> or from <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> modified version.  You may use this
     <a href="#license">license</a> for previous Vim releases instead of the <a href="#license">license</a> that they came
     with, <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#at">at</a> your option.

<a href="#Kibaale">Kibaale</a> Children's Centre (KCC) <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> located in Kibaale, <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> small town in the
south of Uganda, near Tanzania, in East Africa.  The area <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> known <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#as">as</a> Rakai
District.  The population <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> mostly farmers.  Although people are poor, there
usually <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> enough food.  But this district <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> suffering from AIDS more than
any other part of the world.  Some say that <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#it">it</a> started there.  Estimations are
that in the past 10 to 30% of the Ugandans are infected with HIV.  Because
parents die, there are many orphans.  In this district about 60,000 children
have lost one or both parents, out of <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> population of 350,000.  Although AIDS
<a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> now mostly under control, the problems are still continuing.

The children need <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> lot of help.  The KCC <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> working hard to provide the needy
with food, medical care and education.  Food and medical care to keep them
healthy now, and education so that they can take care of themselves in the
future.  KCC works on <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> Christian base, but <a href="https://vimhelp.org/helphelp.txt.html#help">help</a> <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> given to children of any
religion.

The key to solving the problems in this area <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> education.  This has been
neglected in the past years with president Idi Amin and the following civil
wars.  Now that the government <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> stable again, the children and parents have
to learn how to take care of themselves and how to avoid infections.  There <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a>
also <a href="https://vimhelp.org/helphelp.txt.html#help">help</a> for people who are ill and hungry, but the primary goal <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> to
prevent people from getting ill and to teach them how to grow healthy food.

Most of the orphans are living in an extended family.  An uncle or older
sister <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> taking care of them.  Because these families are big and the income
(if any) <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> low, <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> child <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> lucky if <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#it">it</a> gets healthy food.  Clothes, medical
care and schooling <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> beyond its reach.  To <a href="https://vimhelp.org/helphelp.txt.html#help">help</a> these needy children, <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a>
sponsorship program was <a href="https://vimhelp.org/change.txt.html#put">put</a> into place.  <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#A">A</a> child can be financially adopted.
For <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> few dollars <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> month KCC sees to <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#it">it</a> that the child gets indispensable
items, <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> healthy, goes to school and KCC takes care of anything else that
needs to be done for the child and the family that supports it.

Besides helping the child directly, the environment where the child grows up
needs to be improved.  KCC helps schools to improve their teaching methods.
There <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> demonstration school <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#at">at</a> the centre and teacher trainings are given.
Health workers are being trained, hygiene education <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> carried out and
households are stimulated to build <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> proper latrine.  <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#I">I</a> helped setting up <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a>
production site for cement slabs.  These are used to build <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> good latrine.
They are sold below cost price.

There <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> clinic <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#at">at</a> the project, which provides children and their family
medical help.  Since 2020 <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> maternity ward was added and 24/7 service <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a>
available.  When needed, transport to <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> hospital <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> offered.  Immunization
programs are carried out and <a href="https://vimhelp.org/helphelp.txt.html#help">help</a> <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> provided when an epidemic <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> breaking out
(measles and cholera have been <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> problem).
							<span id="donate">donate</span>
Summer 1994 to summer 1995 <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#I">I</a> spent <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> whole year <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#at">at</a> the centre, working <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#as">as</a> <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a>
volunteer.  <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#I">I</a> have helped to expand the centre and worked in the area of water
and sanitation.  <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#I">I</a> learned that the <a href="https://vimhelp.org/helphelp.txt.html#help">help</a> that the KCC provides really helps.
When <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#I">I</a> came back to Holland, <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#I">I</a> wanted to continue supporting KCC.  To <a href="https://vimhelp.org/diff.txt.html#do">do</a> this
I'm raising funds and organizing the sponsorship program.  Please consider one
of these possibilities:

1.  Sponsor <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> child in primary school: 17 <a href="https://vimhelp.org/digraph.txt.html#euro">euro</a> <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> month (or more).
2.  Sponsor <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> child in secondary school: 25 <a href="https://vimhelp.org/digraph.txt.html#euro">euro</a> <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> month (or more).
3.  Sponsor the clinic: Any amount <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> month or quarter
4.  <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#A">A</a> one-time donation

Compared with other organizations that <a href="https://vimhelp.org/diff.txt.html#do">do</a> child sponsorship the amounts are
very low.  This <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> because the money goes directly to the centre.  Less than
5% <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> used for administration.  This <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> possible because this <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> small
organization that works with volunteers.  If you would like to <a href="https://vimhelp.org/sponsor.txt.html#sponsor">sponsor</a> <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a>
child, you should have the intention to <a href="https://vimhelp.org/diff.txt.html#do">do</a> this for <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#at">at</a> least one year.

How <a href="https://vimhelp.org/diff.txt.html#do">do</a> you know that the money will be spent right?  First of all you have my
personal guarantee <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#as">as</a> the <a href="https://vimhelp.org/intro.txt.html#author">author</a> of Vim.  <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#I">I</a> trust the people that are working
<a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#at">at</a> the centre, <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#I">I</a> know them personally.  Furthermore, the centre has been
co-sponsored and inspected by World Vision, Save the Children Fund and <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a> now
under the supervision of Pacific Academy Outreach Society.  The centre <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#is">is</a>
visited about once <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#a">a</a> year to check the progress (at our own cost).  <a href="https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#I">I</a> have
visited the centre myself many times, <a href="https://vimhelp.org/starting.txt.html#starting">starting</a> in 1993.  The visit reports are
on the <a href="#ICCF">ICCF</a> web site.

If you have any further questions, send me e-mail: &lt;Bram@vim.org&gt;.

The address of the centre is:

				<dl>
					<dt>Is BCHS a joke?</dt>
					<dd>
						Software development is full of jokes. 
						This is not one of them. 
					</dd>
					<dt>How do I pronounce <q>BCHS</q>?</dt>
					<dd>
						It's pronounced /biːtʃəz/, <i>beaches</i>.
						Or just Bee See Haich (or <q>Aich</q>) Ess.
					</dd>
					<dt>How can I hire BCHS developers?</dt>
					<dd>
						OpenBSD developers maintain an extensive list of <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/support.html">support</a> options, but these mostly relate
						to system administration.
						A better option is to contact your local <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/groups.html">user
							group</a>; or if an <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/events.html">event</a> is upcoming,
						attend and make enquiries in person.
						Falling through these options, polite enquiry on OpenBSD's <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/mail.html">misc</a> mailing list might get you pushed in
						the right direction.
					</dd>
					<dt>Wasn't this site once funnier?</dt>
					<dd>
						Yes.
						But some folks confused humour with levity.

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Everything is really just bare minimum and not nice to read, but better i publish this now than never!</h3>
<p dir="auto">Here is a YouTube video that shows the general function

<p dir="auto">To build each example you need to enter the "gcc" folder of the choosen one and enter make, with an Segger flasher connected you can also use "flash.bat" and it will directly flash the firmware to the device. (Change the directy to the correct one in the file "jlink_auto_file.jlink" beforehand)</p>
<p dir="auto">In the folder "Custom_Firmware\boards\apollo4l_blue_evb\examples\peripherals\hello_world_lcd" you can find a Rickroll Gif example.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the folder "Custom_Firmware\boards\apollo4l_blue_evb\examples\peripherals\hello_world_uart" you can find an example of using the display, touchscreen and Light sensor, the Accl is started but not working right now( No idea when that will be finished :D )</p>

					<h3>WebLiero <small>  RELEASED AUGUST 2019</small></h3>
					<p>
						After 20 years of intense anticipation from the Liero community it is astounding that the game finally reaches the clouds.

					<h3>lierolibre</h3>
					<p>
						This is a project to liberate Liero from all its proprietary components and to allow it to be distributed completely freely. “lierolibre” is a fork of Liero 1.35b, and features a new non-proprietary sound pack but is otherwise true to the game you were used to back in the nineties. Being completely re-engineered it is also easier to mod than the other games and does not use the original Liero files.

						<h2>About the game</h2>
						<p>
							Liero is a simple game. Pick your five weapons, and unleash your inner fury. The game is always played one versus one on a map of your choice, and yes, you have to play with someone who is right next to you, unless you are enjoying the online multiplayer version!
						</p>
						<p>
							To shoot is of course easy enough to figure out, but if you want to step up your game, you need to figure out things like how to swing yourself to safety with the ninja rope, to use timed weapons for area denial, to hunt without being hunted, to ambush, hit and run, and control that darned guided missile.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you can do all these things, you may one day become a true champion, as the players in this video are trying to accomplish.

			<div id="history">
						<h2>A brief history of Liero</h2>
						<p>Liero - originally envisioned to be a top-down-view game - eventually came out as a clone of MoleZ, a similar subterranean shooter game featuring moles instead of worms. The game was first published in 1998, in the Finnish "mbit" computer game magazine by Joosa Riekkinen. It quickly became a popular pastime in Finland and even won some “game of the week” awards. It soon began spreading on the internet, particularly interesting the owners of low-end computers.</p>
						<p>In 1999, Joosa became disillusioned with game development and decided to retire the game. Development stopped in January 2000 at the final version '1.33'. By this time a multitude of fan sites for Liero had already cropped up on the world wide web. The one which was to become the foundation of the community was "Wormhole - The Ultimate Liero Level Editor". The core of the site was the Liero editor <em>Wormhole</em> which let you convert BMP files into Liero levels, the <em>Liero Blood Increaser</em> which could set the blood spray all the way up to 32750%, and the <em>Liero Graphic Editor</em> which allowed users to create custom skins for the worms and projectiles. The community began to blossom on the Wormhole guestbook page.</p>
						<p>In the following years, the community moved off the guestbooks and message boards into the new heart of the community - The LieroNet Forum. Participation spiked and several new editors saw the light of day, with the most groundbreaking of them all, <em>LieroKit</em> and <em>LieroHacker</em> by Gliptic (Erik Lindroos). This new breed of editors could penetrate much deeper into the Liero game files and allowed editing weapons, changing the palettes, and altering of the physics of the game.</p>
						<p>Simultaneously - a somewhat separate community evolved in southern Poland with the prominent clan “Liga Liero”. The polish community quickly outgrew the international community, but due to the language barrier its strength never truly carried over into the wider world.</p>
						<h4>The next generation</h4>
						<p>The next step in the evolution of the game was the development of the first working clones. The most notable were <em>Wurmz!</em> by Patrys, <em>LOSP</em> by Gliptic, <em>LieroXtreme</em> by JasonB and <em>Gusanos</em> by Basro (Mario Carbajal), and let's not to forget <em>NiL</em> which was the very first clone of the all, and the first Liero for Linux, but was not widely played. All these projects took the game their own slightly divergent directions and with most of them being highly moddable, some with multiplayer features. It is also worth mentioning that innumerable clones projects were begun and abandoned by as many individuals, including 3D clones, Wii versions and anything you can think of.</p>
						<p>The most successful of the clones, <em>LOSP</em> was eventually developed into <em>OpenLiero</em>, which in 2007 was renamed “the official new version of Liero” when released as <em>Liero 1.34</em>. Unlike the other clones, OpenLiero was meant to be an exact simulation of the original Liero and still requires the original game files present in order to run. The idea behind it is to preserve the original game feeling but to allow the game to run properly on modern systems, and other platforms, and removing some notorious bugs. After some deliberation, new game options were added, such as the replay recording feature, new game modes, player profiles and eventually a restructuring of the game menu.</p>
						<p>In 2011 Joosa was approached by arand (Martin Erik Werner) with questions about licensing. It turned out he was making yet another clone based on the OpenLiero source code. The goal was to remove all proprietary content from the game so that it could be included in Linux packages. His version, aptly named <em>lierolibre</em> was released in 2012 and was adopted in 2013 as one of the promoted game versions on Liero.be, so as to give the avid Liero enthusiast complete freedom of choice.</p>
						<p>While the community has mostly vanished into the world, many old sites still survive the tooth of time. Most of the old community content created between 2000 and 2005 can still be found through way-back-machines, Google searches and not-yet-dead links on the Liero sites you may come across. The most important surviving sites are presented above in the resource section.</p>
						<h4>The Internet Age</h4>
						<p>One of the great talking points in the early era of clone-making was "network play". Many developers attempted to create online games, but only <em>LieroXtreme</em> really had any noteworthy success. But while it did have many fans it differed greatly from the original Liero and the purists remained restricted to the horrors of meeting people in real life in order to play a good game of Liero. This would however change abruptly in 2019 when long time Liero community member Basro (Mario Carbajal) combined the networking engine of his other game, the popular football game <em>"Haxball"</em> with the source code of Liero. Cowabunga! The wonderful world of Liero is now available for anyone to play with an unlimited number of friends, and an assurance of absolute mayhem!</p>

        Mozilla 2023 Annual Report: CEO pay skyrockets, while Firefox Marketshare nosedives    </p><div>
        <p>The Mozilla Foundation has <a href="https://stateof.mozilla.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released their latest annual report</a> -- covering the time up through December of 2022 (Mozilla's reporting always lags by one year) -- and something peculiar leaps out of the data:</p><ul><li>The <strong>compensation of the Mozilla CEO has skyrocketed</strong> (by millions)</li><li>While the <strong>Mozilla revenue drops</strong></li><li>And the <strong>Firefox Marketshare takes a nosedive</strong></li></ul><p>While, at first, this seems ridiculously lopsided... perhaps it actually makes sense.</p><p><em>Perhaps</em> the decreasing Firefox marketshare is a good thing, from the Mozilla point of view.</p><h3>Mozilla CEO gets a raise</h3><p>Let's start by looking at the pay of the Mozilla CEO.</p><figure><img src="https://media3.locals.com/images/posts/2023-12-27/102127/102127_dmnwn924regnp3j_custom.jpeg" alt=""><figcaption>Source: Mozilla Foundation 2022 IRS 990</figcaption></figure><p>That's right.&nbsp; Your eyes do not deceive you.&nbsp; The Mozilla CEO earned $6,903,089 in 2022.&nbsp; Just shy of $7 Million.</p><p>The year prior (2021), the CEO earned $5.6 Million.&nbsp; A <strong><em>raise</em></strong> of $1.3 Million dollars.&nbsp; Not a bad year-on-year increase!</p><p><img src="https://media3.locals.com/images/posts/2023-12-27/102127/102127_ok8f4fnipan7noi_custom.jpeg" alt="" width="353" height="218"></p><p>Now let's take a look at the core performance of Mozilla: The overall revenue, and the marketshare of their core product (Firefox) during that same period.</p><p>If a CEO gets a $1.3 Million dollar raise, surely those numbers will be excellent! &nbsp;... <em>Right?</em></p><p>Turns out... the revenue for Mozilla actually <em>dropped</em> between 2021 and 2022.</p><figure><img src="https://media3.locals.com/images/posts/2023-12-27/102127/102127_2irjcoofxpocsx6_custom.jpeg" alt="" width="610" height="348"><figcaption>Source: Mozilla Foundation 2022 IRS 990</figcaption></figure><p>To be fair, not a <em>huge</em> drop.&nbsp; Revenue went from $600 Million in 2021 to $593 Million in 2022.&nbsp; Roughly $7 Million lower.&nbsp; A small decrease, percentage wise... but a decrease just the same.</p><h3>The Firefox Nosedive</h3><p>Now let's look at the marketshare of Mozilla's primary product: Firefox.</p><p><img src="https://media3.locals.com/images/posts/2023-12-27/102127/102127_n8chdg6gk3if4gd_custom.jpeg" alt="" width="388" height="240">From the end of 2021 to the end of 2022 (the period during which the Mozilla CEO received a $1.3 Million Dollar raise), Firefox marketshare took a massive tumble.</p><p>Going from (an already declining) 3.79%... down to 3.04%.</p><p>It's almost as if there is an inverse relationship between Firefox Marketshare and Mozilla CEO compensation -- as marketshare goes down... CEO pay goes up by a similar percentage.</p><p><img src="https://media3.locals.com/images/posts/2023-12-27/102127/102127_n8vy8qci5obkq77_custom.jpeg" alt="" width="420" height="260"></p><p>Absolutely wild.</p><h3>Something doesn't add up... or does it?</h3><p>So.&nbsp; What can we learn from all of this?</p><p>Well, for starters, it is clear that Mozilla CEO compensation is <strong><em>not</em></strong> tied to either the success of the Firefox web browser (their current primary product) <strong><em>or</em></strong> to the overall revenue of Mozilla.</p><p>So what, <em>exactly</em>, could be the justification for that massive pay raise?</p><p>Turns out there are two big, measurable goals that Mozilla appears to have... and, at those goals, it is performing <em>exceptionally</em> well:</p><ol><li>Continued increases to overall corporate financial assets.</li><li>Transitioning Mozilla <em>away</em> from Firefox.</li></ol><p>That first goal is rather obvious.&nbsp; Let's be honest, what company doesn't want to have a massive pile of financial assets?</p><p>In 2022, the Mozilla war-chest (total assets) grew to a staggering <strong>$1.3 Billion Dollars</strong> -- up $157 Million from the year prior.&nbsp; A huge increase to their financial assets.</p><figure><img src="https://media3.locals.com/images/posts/2023-12-27/102127/102127_qnkwb8vtwgx6cf8_custom.jpeg" alt="" width="554" height="357"><figcaption>Source: Mozilla Foundation 2022 IRS 990</figcaption></figure><p>With over half a Billion Dollars in <em>cash</em> alone.&nbsp; That's a lot of cheddar.</p><p>But that's only part of the story.</p><h3>The De-Firefox-ification of Mozilla</h3><p>Let's take another look at the 2022 revenue breakdown.</p><p><img src="https://media3.locals.com/images/posts/2023-12-27/102127/102127_2lxxy1bxxwthsyp_custom.jpeg" alt="" width="571" height="326"></p><p><br>Note that revenue from "Royalties" is down substantially -- a decrease of $17 Million.&nbsp; Those "Royalties" are, in large part, made up of default search engine placement, within Firefox, for one single customer... Google.&nbsp; This decrease makes sense considering the signficant decline in Firefox marketshare.</p><p>But then look at the second row: <strong>"Subscription and advertising revenue"</strong>.</p><p>What is that, exactly? &nbsp;That line item includes some of the more recently launched subscription services -- "Pocket Premium" and "Mozilla VPN" (plus some advertising placement). &nbsp;And, you'll note, <em>that</em> revenue jumped from $56 Million to $75 Million in 2022.</p><p>While that may be a drop in the bucket of the overall Mozilla revenue and war-chest... it's a critical strategy for Mozilla to diversify their revenue stream <strong><em>away from Firefox</em></strong>.</p><p>As it turns out, moving away from Firefox is exactly Mozilla's plan.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/4671162/mozilla-downplaying-firefox-moving-into-a-i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mozilla laid out their vision for the future of their organization</a> -- and it did not include Firefox. &nbsp;The focus for the future of Mozilla -- <em>according to Mozilla</em> -- is primarily based around Artificial Intelligence services.</p><p>In fact, Mozilla leadership stated, quite plainly, that they intend to take Mozilla "in a&nbsp;different direction."</p><p>When you consider the goals of Mozilla... the decreasing Firefox marketshare is no longer much of a concern.&nbsp; In fact, moving revenue away from Firefox, while investing in A.I. systems (and other subscription services) becomes the primary goal.</p><p>And, at that, the Mozilla CEO is excelling.</p><h3>The future of Mozilla</h3><p>What does all of this mean for the future of Mozilla?&nbsp; What have we learned from Mozilla statements coupled with their financial reports?</p><ul><li>Mozilla rewards executives who oversee a decreasing success and reliance upon Firefox -- so we can expect more of that.</li><li>In turn, that likely means reduced investment in Firefox development and promotion over the coming years.</li><li>Mozilla intends to focus on A.I. -- so we can expect more A.I. investment, and possible A.I. services, in the year ahead.</li><li>If all of that holds true, we can likely expect the Mozilla CEO to receive additional raises in the next annual reports.</li></ul><p>If you are a fan of Firefox... none of that points to a particularly bright future.</p><p>That said... if you are the CEO at Mozilla... you might bring in enough income to buy your own island fortress pretty soon.&nbsp; And who doesn't want an island fortress?</p><hr><p>Want more truly independent Tech Journalism?&nbsp; Be sure to grab at least a free membership to&nbsp;<a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/Lunduke.Locals.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lunduke.Locals.com</a>.</p><p>Want to support this important work (and get some exclusive books, videos, and other goodies in the process)?&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grab a paid subscription</a>.</p><hr><p>Other articles you might be interested in:</p><ul><li><a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/5049241/linux-foundation-now-spends-only-2-of-their-revenue-on-linux" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Linux Foundation now spends only 2% of their revenue on Linux</a></li><li><a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/4408159/linux-foundation-decreased-linux-spending-to-3-2-in-2022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Linux Foundation decreased Linux spending to 3.2% in 2022</a></li><li><a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/4458111/the-wiki-piggy-bank" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Wiki Piggy Bank</a></li><li><a href="https://lunduke.locals.com/post/3983662/major-open-source-projects-how-much-money-do-they-actually-make" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Major Open Source Projects: How much money do they actually make?</a></li></ul><div>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Some Interesting Patterns to Reproduce:</h2>
<p dir="auto">You do not need to be exact with the parameters to reproduce these patterns. The best way to get interesting patterns is to first try random parameter explorations, once you find an interesting pattern, try fine-tuning it gradually. To avoid becoming stuck at a local maximum, you can make some occasional big parameter jumps. In this way interesting and different patterns shall keep poping up.</p>

<p dir="auto">This project was inspired by: Jeffery Ventrella's Clusters <a href="http://www.ventrella.com/Clusters/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ventrella.com/Clusters/</a>. I do not have access to Ventrella's code but I guess the main difference of this project from the other particle life projects is that I did not implement collision detection and this made simulating thousands of particles possible in real-time. Also, I added GUI controls to change the parameters in real-time allowing easy fine-tuning and exploration, hence, I was able to find some never-seen-before patterns emerge form some extremely simple models of relations.
The code here is probably an order of magnitude simpler than any other Artificial Life codes out there because I started this code solely as an educational material for non-programmers and general audience to prove the point that complexity can arise from simplicity.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Todos:</h2>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Adding the ability to save and load parameters (so that people can easily share the interesting models they find)</li>
<li>Ability to add more particle types (currently it is fixed to four particle types)</li>
<li>Currently, the biggest bottleneck is the nested for-loops (which calculate the pairwise distance among all particles) making the computational complexity quadratic. It would be amazing if we could find a way around.</li>
<li>Alternative to point 3, computing the pairwise distances are embarrassingly parallel so it can be computed on GPU.</li>
<li>Adding the ability to resize the screen and improving boundary-checking as many fast moving particles can escape the screen bounds.</li>
<li>Adding a more intuitive UI so that it gives the ability for a finer control over the parameters.</li>
<li>Adding a randomize button or, even better, having a simple meta rule to mutate the initial rule continously and recursively. This way the patterns will never get stuck on a local maximum and will keep changing!</li>
<li>A better way to fine-tune is to use an evolutionary algorithm to select and optimize the parameters but one needs to write a fitness function for that. I currently don't know what fitness function corresponds to in the realm of this program. In our world the fitness function is competition and survival of the fittest. However, here we fine-tune and select the parameters that produce interesting patterns for us but the word "interesting" is easier to say than to define!</li>

<p><strong>WARNING LETTER</strong></p>

<p>December 20, 2023</p>

<p><strong>RE: 662503</strong></p>

<p>Dear Mr. Jassy:</p>

<p>This letter concerns your firm’s distribution of products that violate the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FD&amp;C Act”). The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) purchased on your website, www.amazon.com, products that are labeled as energy enhancing supplements or food, but laboratory analyses confirmed that they contained undeclared and potentially harmful active pharmaceutical ingredients. As discussed further below, your firm is responsible for introducing or delivering for introduction into interstate commerce products that are unapproved new drugs under section 505(a) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a). Furthermore, the products are misbranded drugs under section 502 of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a), 301(d), and 505(a) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a), 331(d), and 355(a). Your firm is also responsible for introducing or delivering for introduction into interstate commerce a food that is prohibited under section 301(ll) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll).</p>

<p>FDA purchased “MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement,” and “X Max Triple Shot Energy Honey” through your website, www.amazon.com. All of these products were introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce by Amazon via your Fulfillment by Amazon service.<sup><em><strong>1</strong></em></sup> FDA confirmed through laboratory analyses that the “MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “Genergy,” and “X Max Triple Shot Energy Honey” products, purchased on www.amazon.com, contained the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) tadalafil; and the “WeFun,”<sup><em><strong>2</strong></em></sup> “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement” products, also purchased on www.amazon.com, contained the API sildenafil. These ingredients are not declared on the products’ labeling.<sup><em><strong>3</strong></em></sup> Sildenafil and tadalafil are phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors and the active ingredients in the FDA-approved prescription drugs Viagra and Cialis, respectively, used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). These undeclared ingredients may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs, such as nitroglycerin, and may lower blood pressure to dangerous levels.</p>

<p>Information on the labels and/or labeling of “MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement” demonstrates that these products are marketed as dietary supplements<sup><em><strong>4</strong></em></sup>. However, these products do not meet the definition of “dietary supplement” under section 201(ff) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff). Under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i), a product is not a dietary supplement if it includes an article that is approved as a new drug under section 505 of the FD&amp;C Act, unless that article was marketed as a dietary supplement or food before its approval as a drug. Sildenafil and tadalafil were not marketed as dietary supplements or as foods before Viagra and Cialis were FDA-approved. FDA approved Viagra (containing sildenafil as the active ingredient) as a new drug on March 27, 1998. FDA approved Cialis (containing tadalafil as the active ingredient) as a new drug on November 21, 2003. Given that sildenafil and tadalafil were not marketed as dietary supplements or as foods before Viagra and Cialis were FDA-approved, “MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement,” which contain sildenafil or tadalafil, are excluded from the definition of “dietary supplement” under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&amp;C Act.</p>

<p>The remaining product, “X Max Triple Shot Energy Honey,” is a food<sup><em><strong>5</strong></em></sup> that was confirmed by laboratory analysis to contain tadalafil.</p>

<p><u><strong>Unapproved New Drugs</strong></u></p>

<p>The “MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement” products that are marketed as dietary supplements are drugs as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. Examples of claims observed on the labeling, including the outer packaging, that establish the intended use of these products as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:</p>

<p><strong>“MANNERS Energy Boost”</strong><br>
From the product label:</p>

<ul><li>“Energy Boost”</li>
</ul><p><strong>“Round 2”</strong><br>
From the product label:</p>

<ul><li>“THE POWER TO GO AGAIN! STRENGTH * ENERGY * ENDURANCE”</li>
</ul><p><strong>“WeFun”</strong><br>
From the product label:</p>

<ul><li>“Energy[,] Performance”</li>
</ul><p><strong>“Genergy”</strong><br>
From the product label:</p>

<ul><li>“ENERGY FOR MEN”</li>
</ul><p><strong>“Big Guys Male Energy Supplement”</strong><br>
From the product label:</p>

<ul><li>From the product name: “Male Energy Supplement”</li>
	<li>“Extreme Power”</li>
	<li>“Focus . . . Energy . . . Mood”</li>
	<li>“500 MG POWER BOOST”</li>
</ul><p><strong>“Mens Maximum Energy Supplement”</strong><br>
From the product label:</p>

<ul><li>The product name: “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement”</li>
	<li>“NEVER ENDING ENERGY!”</li>
	<li>“STRENGTH[,] ENERGY[,] ENDURANCE”</li>
</ul><p>“MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement” are not generally recognized as safe and effective for their above referenced uses and, therefore, are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). There are no FDA-approved applications in effect for “MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement.” Introduction or delivery of these products into interstate commerce without approved applications violates sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a).</p>

<p><strong>Misbranded Drugs</strong></p>

<p>Additionally, “MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement” are misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a). Under section 502(a) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a), a drug is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Section 201(n) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(n), provides that, in determining whether an article’s labeling or advertising “is misleading there shall be taken into account . . . not only representations made or suggested . . . but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in light of such representations.” The labeling for these products does not declare that they contain PDE-5 inhibitors. The use of PDE-5 inhibitors can be associated with significant safety issues and the risk of serious adverse events. The undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in these products may pose serious health risks because consumers with underlying medical issues may take the products without knowing that they can cause serious harm or interact in dangerous ways with other drugs they may be taking. For example, PDE-5 inhibitors may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs (such as nitroglycerin) and can lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. Consumers with diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease often take nitrates. The failure to disclose these ingredients in the products’ labeling renders them misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&amp;C Act.</p>

<p>“MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement” are also misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for their intended uses. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layman can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (see 21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1), include those that, because of their toxicity or other potentiality for harmful effect, and/or the method of their use, and/or the collateral measures necessary for their use, are not safe for use except under supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer them. All PDE-5 inhibitors which have been approved for marketing by FDA are limited by an approved new drug application to use under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs. “MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement,” which contain undeclared sildenafil or tadalafil, are also prescription drugs as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&amp;C Act, and as such, can be used safely only at the direction and under the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write “adequate directions for use” for “MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement” such that a layperson can use these drugs safely for their intended uses. These products are not exempt from the requirements that their labeling bear adequate directions for use by a layperson, 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, because there are no FDA-approved applications in effect for these products. For these reasons, “MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement” are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&amp;C Act.</p>

<p>The undeclared sildenafil or tadalafil in “MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement” also causes the products to be misbranded under section 502(f)(2) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(2), because their labeling lacks adequate warnings against unsafe dosage or methods or duration of administration or application, in such manner and form, as are necessary for the protection of users. As previously noted, there is a potential for serious health risks associated with these products, particularly since anyone who takes these products would be unaware of the presence of the undeclared drug ingredients and placed at risk for the associated adverse events.</p>

<p>The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drug products is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).</p>

<p><strong>Prohibited Act under Section 301(ll)</strong></p>

<p>It is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&amp;C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any food to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&amp;C Act or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public. As noted above, FDA purchased “X Max Triple Shot Energy Honey” from www.amazon.com and confirmed through laboratory testing that the product contained undeclared tadalafil. Based on available evidence, FDA has determined that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to tadalafil.<sup><em><strong>6</strong></em></sup> The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of “X Max Triple Shot Energy Honey” is therefore prohibited under section 301(ll) of the FD&amp;C Act.</p>

<p>With so much of our digital lives neatly saved and synced in our web browser of choice, the idea of switching to a different one can feel as daunting as moving to a new home. Chrome Sync, in particular, has kept many people using Chrome. However, as good as Chrome Sync is, Firefox Sync is surprisingly better.</p>

<p>The promise of <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/408150/how-to-turn-syncing-on-or-off-in-chrome/">Chrome Sync</a> has always been great, and I feel like it lived up to it for a while. As time has gone on, though, I've had more than a few problems with Chrome Sync. Some of the features simply don't work like they should. It ends up be more frustrating than convenient, which completely defeats the purpose. That's why <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/787392/why-you-should-try-firefox-on-android/">a recent switch to Firefox</a> felt like a breath of fresh air.</p>

<p>As a refresher, <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/408363/how-to-choose-what-information-to-sync-in-chrome/">Chrome Sync is capable of syncing</a> bookmarks, passwords, browsing history, tabs, payment info, personal info, and settings across devices signed into with the same Google account. That's the idea, at least.</p>

<p>The biggest problems I've had with Chrome Sync are history and tabs. I was constantly having issues with Chrome being able to find things in my history from the address bar. I'd start typing the page name into the bar, expecting to see it propagate in the results, and it never would. These were not pages I visited as a one-off, mind you—they appeared in my browsing history many times. Chrome simply wouldn't bring them up.</p>

<p>The Tab Syncing feature worked better, but I found it to be terribly laggy. The idea is to pick up where you left off on a different device. That's hard to do when you get to the other device and the "Tabs From Other Devices" aren't current. The situation gets more annoying when you add in the aforementioned history search woes, making it even more frustrating to find pages.</p>

<p>Long story short, Chrome's continuity features have felt lacking to me for a while. However, they weren't bad enough to be the reason I tried Firefox. I wasn't expecting Firefox Sync to be any better. To be honest, I assumed these were just common browser annoyances. I was wrong.</p>

<p>On the surface, Firefox Sync seems to be basically the same as Chrome Sync. To set it up, you just need to sign into your devices with the same Mozilla account and choose what you'd like to sync. It's an easy process made even easier with scannable QR codes from Firefox on your mobile devices.</p>
<!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"before","adPosition":2,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":2,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"actualCount":1229} --><!-- Zone: character count repeatable. --><!-- No ads allowed! --><!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"after","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":2,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"actualCount":0} -->
<p>The magic of Firefox Sync doesn't have anything to do with the core concept. It's essentially trying to do the same things as Chrome Sync. In my experience, the big difference is it actually works.</p>
<!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. --><!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"actualCount":205} -->
<p>When I type the name of a web page from my history in the Firefox address bar, it shows up. Doesn't matter if I've visited that page a hundred times or only once. If it appears in my history, Firefox will show it to me. That includes history from Firefox on <em>all </em>my devices.</p>
<!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. --><!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"actualCount":486} -->
<p>Tab Syncing is even better. As I'm writing this, I opened a webpage on my computer and immediately grabbed my phone, launched Firefox, opened the tabs, and the page had already synced to "Tabs From Other Devices." I didn't have to wait for anything to sync or manually tap a button to make it happen. To borrow a saying, "It just works." As it should.</p>
<!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. --><!-- Repeatable debug data: {"injection":"none","adPosition":3,"startingPoint":0,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":3,"nbrPlacementsScanned":3,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"actualCount":865} -->

<p>Truly, if you do a lot of switching between devices, you should give Firefox a try. I haven't even mentioned the handy "Tabs From Other Devices" toolbar shortcut you can use on the desktop version or the ability to see other devices from the "<a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-set-tab-pickup-firefox-view" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Firefox View</a>" screen. I didn't switch to Firefox for syncing features, but it is what's keeping me there.</p>

<p><i>Foundations</i> is a series of articles, first published in the magazine <i>Eidolon</i>, on some of the theories of twentieth-century physics that have most influenced modern science fiction.  However, these are not essays on the history or philosophy of science; their aim is to show how the central idea of each theory leads to detailed, quantitative predictions of real physical effects.  For example, the article on special relativity derives formulas for time dilation, Doppler shift, and aberration.</p>
<p>These articles are for the interested lay reader.  No prior knowledge of mathematics beyond high school algebra and geometry is needed.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
			
			<p><small>December 28, 2023
            </small></p><p>It’s 2004 and I’m sitting in one of the largest lecture halls at my university. I’m a computer science major but I’m taking a course on natural history — plants and animals — as one of my electives.</p>
<p>The professor tells us that he’s brought something from home, something he found in his freezer. He reaches down behind his desk, and then holds his arm out to show us what’s sitting in his palm: a baby painted turtle. We’re learning about cold-blooded animals, and it turns out that painted turtle hatchlings are pretty special — they’re one of only a few species that can survive being frozen.</p>
<p>Now, the lecture hall is pretty modern for 2004: there’s an overhead camera at the podium, where the professor can write notes that are displayed on screens around the hall. But instead of writing notes, he puts the turtle under the camera and starts his lecture.</p>
<p>Over the next hour, we watch this little reptile slowly come to life as the professor lectures. The first movements were nearly imperceptible. An eyelid cracking open, a leg inching forward. By the end of the lecture, the turtle has moved about halfway across our screens.</p>
<p>I’ll never forget that class, because it’s where I really understood what it means for an animal to be cold blooded. You see, warm-blooded animals — like humans or mice — have a stable body temperature that stays within a pretty narrow range. For humans, it’s around 37 degrees Celsius. A few degrees higher or lower and we’re in big trouble. Cold-blooded animals like the painted turtle can adapt their metabolism to the temperature around them. They’re active when it’s warm out, and as the environment (and their bodies) get cooler, they move more slowly. Very few of them can survive being frozen like the baby painted turtle can.</p>
<p>I see a similar dichotomy with software projects. Certain technology decisions lead to projects that are warm-blooded: everything is great when there’s constant motion on the project, generating heat. But put warm-blooded software in the freezer, and you’ll pull out a corpse six months later.</p>
<p>Maybe your CI isn’t working because one of the services you depend on got bought or ran out of money. You add a new dependency and find yourself needing to upgrade your compiler. Another package you depend on is deprecated, and doesn’t work with the latest version of the compiler.</p>
<p>Some projects are different. You work alone, make some changes when you’re inspired, and then don’t touch it again for another year, or two, or three. You can’t run something like that as a warm-blooded project. There’s not enough activity to keep the temperature up.</p>
<p>A cold-blooded project is like the baby painted turtle. You can freeze it for a year and then pick it back up right where you left off.</p>
<p>A cold-blooded project uses <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">boring technology</a>. The build and test scripts don’t depend on external services that might change, break, or disappear entirely. It uses <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#vendoring">vendored dependencies</a>.</p>
<p>The software that powers this blog is cold-blooded. The first commit was nearly twelve years ago — a simple little static site generator to replace my out-of-date Wordpress installation:</p>
<pre><code>commit 68949229ad426c1e8795ee640808db9987ab30ab
Author: Patrick Dubroy &lt;<a href="https://dubroy.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="4b3b2f3e293924320b2c262a222765282426">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>&gt;

    Add templates and site-building script.</code></pre>


<p>It’s written in Python (2, not 3). It depends on four third-party modules, and they’re all committed to the project repository. Everything runs locally, and I deploy the result with rsync over ssh.</p>
<p>And boy am I glad I decided to do it that way. I’ve made a few small improvements over the years, but otherwise it’s continued to work without modification. And I fully expect that it will still be working in another twelve years.</p>

If your team is tasked with creating a ML vision project but no one in it has any experience with AI, then their intrinsic cognitive load will be initially very high as they learn this domain. Ideally, teams should work with domains that mostly align with their expertise but also leave some room for growth to keep it exciting. A bit of intrinsic cognitive load is good because engineers love skilling up, but too much of it can cause significant delays and anxiety about delivering quality outcomes soon.</p><p><strong>Single team</strong></p><p>Even though a team can be cross-functional and have expertise across various disciplines, there is an upper limit of how much this can be stretched. If there is a significant gap in skills for the team to achieve what they need, consider enabling them by providing them with the necessary training and time to catch up.</p><p>If your project requires too much expertise across too many domains you run the risk of turning the team into a group of individuals that each specialise on a separate domains, this will likely diminish their quality of outcome by making them work independently, rather than as a team. </p><p><strong>Multiple teams</strong></p><p>Having multiple teams gives you a wider scope to be able to split the domains across a larger number of people and will also give you more choices on the scope of expertise available to you. As an organization you may want to consider strategies to reduce intrinsic cognitive load by assigning no more than one complex domain per team, and also providing training or having enabling teams that can teach other teams to get better in a particular area. For example an SRE team that helps other teams understanding SLOs and observability in general.</p><p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p><ul><li><p>If you have a single team available to work on your vision and their expertise does not align with the problem you are trying to solve, consider enhancing the teams abilities by providing them with training.</p></li><li><p>Don’t assign too many domains for a single team, or risk them becoming a collection of individuals not working together and learning as a group.</p></li><li><p>Having multiple teams allows you to increase the scope of your software architecture with additional expertise. Align each domain with the right team for the task and enhance skillsets where needed with training or having enabling teams to train and assist their expertise.</p></li></ul><p>These are all the things that a team needs to do that does not contribute directly to the outcome of their work. Extraneous cognitive load can happen for multiple reasons, many of which may be inescapable or time consuming to fix, affecting the entire company. For example, a team that’s bogged down with tedious infrastructure tasks, tedious company processes, yak shaving, waiting for tickets to be fulfilled by another team, technical debt accrued company wide - all those things are extraneous cognitive load that don’t directly contribute to outcomes. Hence extraneous cognitive load is the least desirable of cognitive loads because it can create too much friction on the way to delivery.</p><p>In addition to extraneous cognitive load affecting the organization, the type of architecture can also, in some cases, add extraneous cognitive load:</p><p><strong>Single team</strong></p><p>Splitting a single team’s work into multiple microservices has the potential to add additional extraneous cognitive load in the form of costly communication boundaries that can fragment the team’s work.</p><p><a href="https://www.opslevel.com/resources/optimizing-engineering-communication-for-better-developer-experience#1-work-as-a-form-of-communication" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Communicating via work</a><span> is the best form of engineering communication, but this takes different forms whether communicating across teams or within the same team. The ideal communication boundaries for collaboration across teams are well-designed APIs (or libraries!). But this is not the case for communication within a team because all members will be familiar with the domain they are working on, hence abstractions within the team aren’t as much of a requirement and can create extraneous cognitive load. In this case it will be the clarity of your code, your documentation, your design and discussions that drive your communication. </span></p><p>Splitting the work of a single team into multiple microservices, each with their own API can have a significant overhead in the amount of work that a team has to do to keep these APIs well-designed, user friendly and documented, and it can fragment the team’s work across multiple repositories and unnecessary boundaries. In this case a modular approach in a single code base may be preferable to keep consistency and focus within the team. </p><p><strong>Multiple teams</strong></p><p>Splitting the architecture into microservices when having multiple teams frees them with more time to implement well-designed communication boundaries in the form of APIs, ceasing to be extraneous cognitive load. Because these APIs will be used by other teams, it has two main advantages:</p><ol><li><p>It reduces the need for different teams to have to constantly talk to each other to get work done.</p></li><li><p>It enables other teams to self-service the abstractions of another team’s work. It mitigates or eliminates their extraneous cognitive load because they won’t need to be overly familiar with every domain, as long as they know how to use the API - which must be well-designed and intuitive.</p></li></ol><p>In this case the API keeps the organization well-oiled as it reduces the cognitive load of other teams and unnecessary communication, helping every team get into the flow.</p><p>However if you split the domains across multiple teams and communication boundaries are not properly defined with elegant APIs or other self-service tooling, then you will quickly find yourself in a situation where every team is constantly communicating with everyone, trying to understand each other’s domain to do their job. This is far from ideal and will create a significant amount of extraneous cognitive load.</p><p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p><ul><li><p>It is a joint engineering and leadership effort to ensure that all extraneous cognitive load is mitigated or ideally eliminated. This can be done by simplifying processes, reducing yak shaving, abstracting domains in the forms of APIs for other teams to use, designing architecture in a way that does not create redundant communication channels, etc.  If reducing or eliminating extraneous cognitive load is not possible at the moment, it must be taken into consideration when assigning work to a team. Too much extraneous cognitive load limits the amount (and potentially the quality) of outcomes a team can deliver and can lead to burnout.</p></li><li><p>A single team working on multiple microservices can introduce additional extraneous work in the form of communication boundaries and fragmenting the work within the team. It may be preferable instead to work on a modular monolith that can later be split if necessary.</p></li><li><p>Your communication across teams should be done predominantly with self-service tooling, be it APIs, libraries, CLI or whatever works. Too much communication can cause friction and hurts flow when too many teams are talking to each other when they shouldn’t have to.</p></li></ul><p>Germane cognitive load comes from solving problems that relate to the domain the team is working on, it is what leads to flow state, general developer happiness and quality of outcomes. This cognitive load is mostly positive, provided that teams are not overloaded with too many objectives in too short a time. The more intrinsic and extraneous work you can mitigate, the more germane work your team can focus on.</p><p><strong>Single team</strong></p><p>If you only have one team, consider narrowing down the ambitions of your architecture design before assigning it to the team. Always take into consideration the amount of extraneous cognitive load they will need to deal with. Remember that assigning a complex microservice architecture to a single team will in itself add additional extraneous cognitive load, even if there is none imposed on the team by bad tooling, technical debt, or friction from corporate processes or silos.</p><p>It is better to narrow down your ambitions to what the team is able to deliver safely and adequately than overstretching them until they burn out or aren’t able to delivery features with quality. You can always grow your capacity as the need arises and teams can always make their monoliths modular so it’s easier to split them later, if you ever have to.</p><p><strong>Multiple teams</strong></p><p>If, on the other hand, you have multiple teams at your disposal, then you can consider splitting your architecture into microservices or something similar so that teams can work on their own domain independently. This is better than everyone working together in a monolith or a gigantic shared codebase where everyone is overloaded with continuous communication.</p><p>When multiple teams work together to deliver software, make sure your team topologies reflect your software architecture and favour well-designed APIs as a form of communication for teams. This makes it easier for a team to abstract the complexities of their domain and it reduces the amount of talking needed to deliver work by the organization as a whole. </p><p><strong>Recommendations</strong></p><ul><li><p>Favour modular, monolithic architecture if you only have a single team. Design the software to fit the team’s capacity so they can deliver quality of outcomes. Always take intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load into consideration, as they will reduce the amount of germane cognitive load your team can handle.</p></li><li><p>If you have multiple teams and complex requirements, favour microservices or architectures that make it easy for teams to communicate and abstract their domain via well-designed APIs. Never assign more than a single complex domain to each team.</p></li></ul><p>Just like an organization chart should never be designed without consulting technical teams to match the architecture designs, architectural styles should never be decided without understanding capacity and the types of cognitive load affecting engineering.</p><p>Once these are understood, leadership and engineering can decide on more effective architectural designs and can take steps to mitigate or eliminate extraneous cognitive load and help the intrinsic load.</p><p>There is room in this topic to explore cross team communication in more detail, but that deserves its own post some time later.</p><p><span>Fernando Villalba is a Developer Relations at </span><a href="https://www.opslevel.com/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">OpsLevel</a><span>, he has over a decade of miscellaneous IT experience.

<p>Apparently Randall Munroe gets a lot of messages saying that the “random”
button on xkcd is biased.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2015-03-19 16:47:00    <strong>Hobz</strong>    also, Randall, the random button on the xkcd
frontpage is frustratingly un-random</p>
<p>2015-03-19 18:50:52   <strong>~Randall</strong>    it’s random.</p>
<p>2015-03-19 18:50:59   <strong>~Randall</strong>    people contact me constantly to tell me
that it’s not</p>
<p>2015-03-19 18:51:17   <strong>~Randall</strong>    which is a nice illustration of that mental
bias we have</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I thought I would do a little investigating to see just how random xkcd is.</p>
<hr>
<p>Making consistently random numbers (yes, that sounds weird) is really important
in things like cryptography. Unrandom random numbers can cripple an otherwise
secure network. So there’s a surprisingly large amount of work dedicated to
randomness.</p>
<p>There are services like <a href="http://www.random.org/">random.org</a> which pride
themselves on randomness, and <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits/">HotBits</a>,
which lets you order random bytes that are generated from radioactive decay. A
lot of applications use <code>/dev/urandom/</code>, which is an OS-level random generator
that uses all sorts of sources of entropy such as network noise, CPU heat, and
the current weather in Kansas.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s <em>really</em> hard to tell whether numbers are random or not.
Of course, patterns <a href="http://boallen.com/random-numbers.html">can creep into random
numbers</a>. But more annoyingly, a
glaringly obvious pattern might just be accidental. My favorite example of this
is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_point">Feynman Point</a>, which is a
series of lots of 9s that appears somewhere in the (very unpredictable) decimal
expansion of pi.</p>
<p><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/ayn_random.png" alt="xkcd 1277"></p>
<p>There are a bunch of established ways to test the randomness of a random number
generator (such as the excitingly-named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diehard_tests">Diehard
tests</a>). They all test for features
that ostensibly random data should have. For example, a random stream of bits
should have almost as many ones as zeros. Not all tests are that obvious,
though, and statistics can be very slippery and unintuitive when it feels like
it.</p>
<p>NIST (the National Institute of Standards and Technology, who deal with things
like how long an inch is and how to backdoor elliptic curves)
<a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/rng/documentation_software.html">publishes</a>
a standard for randomness based on such tests, and distributes software that
runs these tests on datasets.</p>
<p>I wrote a Python program to download 10,000 xkcd-random numbers (yay
<code>requests</code>!), and converted them into bitstrings. Then, I fed them to the NIST
Statistical Test Suite.</p>
<p>The results are below:</p>

<p>I encourage you to play with the STS code. It lets you do all sorts of other
neat things, like testing bitstrings for common “templates” and reporting if
too many are found. It also segfaults all over the place, which is actually
very disturbing considering that it’s technically part of the US government’s
computer security project.</p>
<p>In any case, we’ve established that xkcd’s random generator is reasonably
unpredictable and unbiased. As it happens, they’re using the Mersenne Twister,
which is a well-established pseudorandom generation algorithm.</p>
<hr>
<p>So why does the random number generation appear so biased when we’re idly
refreshing on lazy Sunday nights? Part of it is, of course, human nature. We
like to see patterns everywhere.</p>
<p>But here’s a more concrete, mathematical explanation. The conceptual idea is
that in the beginning, hitting “random” is likelier to hit an unread comic, but
once you’ve seen more and more of them, you get repeats. Let’s try to quantify
this: we’re going to calculate the <em>expected value</em> of the number of times you
need to hit “random” until you have seen every single comic. You may have seen
this problem in the context of “how many times do you need to roll a die until
you have rolled all six faces at least once?”.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value">Expected value</a> is the average
value of some random variable if you do an experiment lots of times. For
example, if you roll a die gazillions of time, the average number you’ll get is
$ (1+2+3+4+5+6)/6 = 3.5 $, so that’s the <em>expected</em> value.</p>
<p>We’re going to calculate the expected number of times you hit “random” by
calculating the number of times you need to hit it to get the first, second,
third, and (in general) nth unique comic. Then, because of a useful property of
expected values, we can just add them together until $ n = 1500 $ (there are
1500 comics published as of right now) to see how long, as of today, this
process would take.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for your $ n $th unread comic, each time you hit “random”
you have a $ 1 - n/1500 $ chance of getting a fresh one. This is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution">geometric
probability distribution</a>,
which is Math for “you keep trying something with a constant probability until
it succeeds”.  For geometric probability distributions, the expected value is
one over the probability (though I’m not going to prove it here, this
intuitively makes sense: you would expect to have to roll a die around 6 times
until you get your first 1, or to flip a coin twice until you get your first
heads).</p>
<p>Anyhow, for the nth comic, the expected number of clicks is $ 1500/(1500-n) $. Adding
these up for each $ n $, we have this monstrosity:</p>
<p>\[ \sum_{n=1}^{1500} \frac{1500}{n} = \frac{1500}{1500} + \frac{1500}{1499} + \dots + \frac{1500}{2} + \frac{1500}{1} \]</p>
<p>This works out to, on average, 11836 clicks. That’s a lot of clicks.</p>
<p>As common sense dictates, the more times you have clicked “random”, the less
likely it is for you to hit a new comic. And that’s why Randall’s random button
seems biased.</p>
<hr>
<p>One more bit of statistics: if you’ve taken a probability class, you might have
heard of the birthday problem. That is, say you have a party with $ n $ people.
What is the probability that some pair of people at the party share a birthday?</p>
<p>It turns out that if you have just 23 people, the probability is already 50-50.
This is somewhat counterintuitive; most birthday parties only have one birthday
boy! The fallacy is that the problem isn’t asking if some <em>particular</em> person
shares a birthday with someone else. It’s asking if <em>any</em> two people share a
birthday.</p>
<p>The birthday “paradox” turns out to be important in cryptography, especially
when looking for hash collisions. The number of hashes you need to generate
before you hit a collision is similar to the number of people you need at a
party before some pair shares a birthday—much smaller than what you would
expect.</p>
<p>In terms of xkcd-surfing, this helps answer the question “how many times will I
hit random before I see a repeat?”.</p>
<p>There are plenty of good explanations for the math behind the birthday problem
online (<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BirthdayProblem.html">Wolfram Mathworld</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">Wikipedia</a>)—but if you
don’t believe the number 23 quoted above, it’s worth spending some time trying
to solve it yourself just to understand what’s really going on (it’s not hard).
I’m just going to dump the formula here without any explanation.</p>
<p>For 1500 comics, the probability that you get a repeat after $ k $ clicks is:</p>
<p>\[ 1 - \frac{1500!}{(1500-k)!1500^k} \]</p>
<p>Throwing this at WolframAlpha, we see that after only 45 clicks, you have a
50-50 chance of seeing a duplicate comic. Put a different way, <em>there are even
odds that the last 45 comics you have seen contain a duplicate pair somewhere
in there</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p>So we’ve empirically validated that xkcd’s RNG is as close as we can expect for
something statistically random. We’ve also seen two reasons why it feels
biased.</p>
<p>But on a deeper and much more important level, we’ve seen how counterintuitive
and messy the random-number business is, and how statistical facts can trick us
into seeing patterns that aren’t there.</p>
<hr>
<p>P.S. My methodology for these experiments probably not the best, since I have
no formal statistics background. If you want to check out the code used or a
dump of my dataset, leave a comment below and I’ll send it to you.</p>

However, they were all so similar in how they looked like—80x25 characters didn’t leave much room for uniqueness—and how they worked that the differences didn’t really get in the way of usability and discoverability. Once you learned that the Alt key opened the menus and that Tab moved across input fields and buttons, you could navigate almost any program with ease.</p><p><span>But let’s talk about editors. MS-DOS shipped with a TUI text editor since version 5 (1981), which </span><a href="https://blogsystem5.substack.com/p/a-cli-text-editor-in-my-windows" rel="">I previously covered in a recent article</a><span> and is shown above.

printf.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Remember: all of this in the early 1990s—a little over 30 years ago at the time of this writing.</p><p><span>I was an avid user of Turbo C++, with which I learned a lot. I remember using their </span><code>conio.h</code><span> libraries to implement TUIs of my own, and then their builtin </span><code>graphics.h</code><span> libraries to play with implementing GUIs. And note: this was </span><em>without the Internet</em><span>. There was no option for many to just “look up how things worked” in Stack Overflow: the IDE had to be discoverable right away (which it was) and self-contained to offer you a complete development experience.</span></p><p>Now take a moment to compare this scene with Linux in the early 1990s.</p><p><span>In Linux, almost every program was </span><em>also</em><span> text based, but those programs did not come with a full-screen TUI. It just wasn’t “the Unix way”. I remember watching the X11 configuration tool (</span><code>XF86Setup</code><span>) or the OpenBSD installer and feeling shocked by how simplistic those were: me, a young teenager with barely any “real” coding experience, had written better-looking programs already.</span></p><p><span>In any case, this didn’t stop me from my quest to </span><em>not</em><span> use Windows. I continued to learn the ways of Linux and soon faced the “best” editors recommended by every book and community online: Vim and Emacs. And I could not understand why they were praised. Using these was like stepping back into the past. They were full-screen programs indeed, but they seemed pretty arcane. Vim did have syntax highlighting but it was far from being an IDE. Emacs could be configured to integrate with some code assisting features and the like, but it was far from being “fire and forget” like the Turbo family of IDEs.</span></p><p><span>Just look at the default Emacs configuration </span><em>today</em><span>, which hasn’t changed much (if at all) since then.

In fact, it feels like during these 30 years, we regressed in many ways, and only now are reaching feature parity with some of the features we used to have.</span></p><p><span>It is natural that TUIs diminished in popularity once graphical OSes gained traction, and it is somewhat interesting that they are making a comeback just now. As for why, I think we have to thank the invention of </span><a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/" rel="">LSP</a><span> for most of the recent progress in this area. TUI editors were “on hold” for many years because building IDE features for them was a lot of effort and their small maintainer base could not afford to implement them. LSP unlocked access to existing language-specific integrations and reinfused interest in the old-and-trusty Vim and Emacs. Hopefully, the upcoming </span><a href="https://build-server-protocol.github.io/" rel="">BSP</a><span> will do even more to make these TUIs more IDE-like.</span></p><p>It is fair to ask “Who cares? Every desktop and laptop runs a graphical OS now!”</p><p><span>And it’s a good question. In general, you probably </span><em>don’t</em><span> want a TUI IDE. If VSCode is your jam, its remoting abilities are superb and VSCode has a reasonably good graphical interface without being a full-blown IDE. But there are a few things that VSCode doesn’t give us.</span></p><p><span>The first is that a TUI IDE is excellent for work on remote machines—even better than VSCode. You can SSH into </span><em>any</em><span> machine with ease and launch the IDE. </span><a href="https://jmmv.dev/2015/09/my-coding-workflow.html" rel="">Combine it with tmux and you get “full” multitasking.</a><span> Yes, you could instead use a remote desktop client instead of SSH, but I’ve always found them clunky due to lag and the improper integration with the local desktop shortcuts.</span></p><p><span>The second is that </span><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/faq#_why-arent-the-remote-development-extensions-or-their-components-open-source" rel="">VSCode’s remote extensions are </a><em><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/faq#_why-arent-the-remote-development-extensions-or-their-components-open-source" rel="">not</a></em><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/faq#_why-arent-the-remote-development-extensions-or-their-components-open-source" rel=""> open source</a><span>, which isn’t a major problem… except for the fact that they don’t work on, say, FreeBSD and there is no way to fix them. So this makes it impossible for me to remote into my primary development server with VSCode.</span></p><p>And the third is… reduced resource consumption.</p><p>I can’t leave without ranting about “bloat” for a little bit. Borland Turbo C++, with all its bells and whistles (the UI, the C++ toolchain, the integrated manuals…), is less than 9 MB after installation and ran within 640kb of RAM.</p><p>For comparison, Helix is 16 MB on disk, which is pretty impressive (and honestly unexpected), but Doom Emacs is about 500 MBs and consumes many MBs of RAM. Note, however, that none of these numbers account for the language toolchains or help systems, and toolchains nowadays rank in the GBs of disk space.</p><p>To get “real” IDEs, we have to jump to graphical programs like IntelliJ or VSCode. VSCode, for example, is about 350 MBs on disk (surprisingly less than Doom Emacs) but it will eat your computer for lunch: it’s Electron after all. I have noticed very significant savings in laptop battery life by dropping VSCode and moving to Doom Emacs.</p><p><span>So the question I want to part with is: have we advanced </span><em>much</em><span> in 30 years? Modern IDEs have some better refactoring tools, better features, and support more languages, but fundamentally… they haven’t changed much. The only major difference that we are </span><em>starting</em><span> to see might be AI-assisted coding, but this is a feature mostly provided by a remote service, not even by the installed code!</span></p><p><span>And that’s all for today. On my side, I’ll happily continue using </span><em>all of</em><span> Doom Emacs, Vim, VSCode, and IntelliJ depending on the situation. Merry Christmas if this is your thing!</span></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>How the history of military and government PSYOPS involving mind-control, UFOs, magic, and remote-control zombies, explains the future of AI and generative media. Along the way, talk attendees will be given an enrollment code to join a specialized CTF/ARG game called CYCLOPS that explores these themes and that will run the duration of Congress. </p>

<p>As AI-generated content, social-media influence operations, micro-targeted advertising, and ubiquitous surveillance have become the norm on the Internet and in the market in general, we have entered an era of PSYOP Capitalism. This is an era of hallucinations designed to transform each of us into a “targeted individual” through the manipulation of perception. This talk explores a secret history of reality-altering military and intelligence programs that serve as antecedents to a phantasmagoric present.</p>

<p>At the talk, attendees will be given a registration code to play “CYCLOPS,” a CTF/ARG game that will run the duration of Congress. CYCLOPS explores the themes of the mind-control and PSYOPS through an interactive parafictional narrative taking place in the context of an obscure CIA cognitive warfare program from the early days of the Cold War.

<h2>I formally modeled Dreidel for no good reason</h2>
<p>It's the sixth night of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanukkah" target="_blank">Channukah</a> and I'm thinking about dreidels:</p>
<p><img alt="A dreidel" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/b665a8db-c930-4215-80b1-d8b89661b34f.png?w=960&amp;fit=max"> </p>
<p>On Channukah we use dreidels to play the game dreidel:</p>
<ol>
<li>Every player starts with N pieces (usually chocolate coins). This is usually 10-15 pieces per player.</li>
<li>At the beginning of the game, and whenever the pot is empty, every play antes one coin into the pot.</li>
<li>
<p>Turns consist of spinning the dreidel. Outcomes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>נ (Nun): nothing happens.</li>
<li>ה (Hey): player takes half the pot, rounded up.</li>
<li>ג (Gimmel): player takes the whole pot, everybody antes.</li>
<li>ש (Shin): player adds one of their coins to the pot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a player ever has zero coins, they are eliminated. Play continues until only one player remains, or (much more likely) everybody gets bored.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Traditionally this game is played by kids, as it's an excellent way to convince them that gambling is boring as all hell. In 2015 <a href="https://www.slate.com/articles/life/holidays/2014/12/rules_of_dreidel_the_hannukah_game_is_way_too_slow_let_s_speed_it_up.html" target="_blank">Ben Blatt simulated the game</a> and found that for P=4 and N=10, the average game will take 860 spins to finish. </p>
<p>But this was based on a mere 50,000 simulated games! We can do better than a mere simulation. We can mathematically model the game and get <em>exact</em> numbers. So we're busting out <a href="https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/" target="_blank">PRISM</a>.</p>
<h3>Modeling Dreidel in PRISM</h3>
<p>PRISM is a probabilistic model checker. You create a model of a probabilistic system, like queueing workers or a gambling game, and PRISM can give you exact probabilities of various events happening. I've written two blog posts on PRISM:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/prism/" target="_blank">Probabilistic Modeling with PRISM</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/queueing-prism/" target="_blank">Two workers are quadratically better than one</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you read those blog posts, you'll quickly learn that I <em>really do not like PRISM</em>. The problem is that it is <em>incredibly</em> limited language. It doesn't have strings, or arrays, or <em>functions</em>. This makes generalizing or abstracting things virtually impossible, and you're going to be hardcoding a lot of stuff. Despite all that, I keep finding excuses to use PRISM anyway. I've got an enormous number of small PRISM tricks I will never share with anyone because nobody else will ever use PRISM. Maybe there's a grad student who needs them, I dunno.</p>
<p>I'm not going to go through the entire model, you can see it <a href="https://gist.github.com/hwayne/f8724f0c83393c576b1e20ee4b76966d" target="_blank">here</a>. Just some highlights:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>formula Players = 4; //Players
formula maxval = M*Players;
formula done = (p1=0) | (p2=0) | (p3=0) | (p4=0);
</code></pre></div>

<p>Since I can't abstract over anything, I can't make a general model that works for P players, so instead I hardcode in 4 players. Also, properly modeling "playing until one player is left" would have been a <em>nightmare</em>, so instead I'm just modeling until <em>one</em> player is eliminated.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>    [spin] ((pot != 0) &amp; !done &amp; (turn = 1)) -&gt;
      0.25: (p1' = p1-1) &amp; (pot' = min(pot+1, maxval)) &amp; (turn' = 2) //shin
    + 0.25: (turn' = 2) //nun
    + 0.25: (p1' = min(p1+halfpot,maxval)) &amp; (pot' = pot-halfpot) &amp; (turn' = 2) // hay
    + 0.25: (p1' = min(p1+pot,maxval)) &amp; (pot' = 0) &amp; (turn' = 2); //gimmel
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is the core of a PRISM spec: a set of conditions for this to happen, a set of weighted outcomes, and the updates for each outcome. Though it's mathematically impossible for a shin to make the pot have more than <code>maxval</code> coins, whatever model checking algorithm PRISM uses couldn't tell that, so I had to manually cap it with <code>(pot' = min(pot+1, maxval))</code>. I spent a lot of time on this spec coddling the model checker. </p>
<p>Also notice that I had to hardcode that this is all for <em>player one</em> (<code>p1</code>). This means that I have to write this action three more times:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>    [spin] ((pot != 0) &amp; !done &amp; (turn = 2)) -&gt;
      0.25: (p2' = p2-1) &amp; (pot' = min(pot+1, maxval)) &amp; (turn' = 3)
    + 0.25: (turn' = 3)
    // etc etc etc
</code></pre></div>

<p>All of the actions are guarded on <code>pot!=0</code>. When it's empty, we instead have an ante action:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>    [ante] (pot = 0) &amp; !done -&gt; (pot'=pot+4) &amp; (p1' = p1-1) &amp; (p2' = p2-1) &amp; (p3' = p3-1) &amp; (p4' = p4-1);
</code></pre></div>

<p>Since this means not all actions will be spins, I added a <a href="https://www.prismmodelchecker.org/manual/ThePRISMLanguage/CostsAndRewards" target="_blank">reward</a> to track just the spins: </p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>rewards "num_spins"
    [spin] true : 1;
endrewards
</code></pre></div>

<h3>Querying the system</h3>
<p>So why bother with all this when the Python would be like ten lines? The reason is that once you've gone through all the work of modeling something in PRISM, you get a powerful querying system to learn properties of the model. First, let's just find the expected value (weighted average) for the number of spins to knock out one player:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>$ ./prism dreidel.prism -const M=10 -pf 'R=? [C]'    

Value in the initial state: 63.71149441710945
Time for model checking: 174.563 seconds.
</code></pre></div>

<p>So if we have four players, and each player starts with 10 coins, it'll take on average 64 spins to knock a single player out. I stopwatched a dreidel and it takes about 8 seconds for a spin, so you're looking at about nine minutes of watching a top spin before <em>someone</em> gets to leave the table.</p>
<p>Of course that's only the <em>likeliest</em> outcome. I can also get the cumulative probability like this: </p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>const C0;
P=? [F&lt;=C0 done]
</code></pre></div>

<p>That returns the probability that within C0 steps of starting, <code>done</code> is <strong>F</strong>inally true. Note this is total model checking steps and includes antes too. While I can run this from the command line, it's nicer to see in the GUI.</p>
<p><img alt="A graph of the gui showing that 90% of the time, you'll knock out one player within 150 steps" src="https://assets.buttondown.email/images/07a3fc81-e86d-4a4a-bec8-f1f1768f218c.png?w=960&amp;fit=max"> </p>
<p>Those are still pretty easy to find from a regular simulation, so let's try a more complex property. What's the probability that the game ends because a player rolled a Shin, as opposed to an ante?</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>prism dreidel.prism 
  -pf "P=? [F (pot != 0 &amp; !done &amp; (X done))]" 
  -const M=6:4:10 
  -exportresults stdout

M       Result
6       0.2944666679018678
10      0.2930102532933088
</code></pre></div>

<p>(Don't forget to check the probability it ends because of an ante!)</p>
<p>What's the probability that the first player will have 75% of all pieces in the game, and still lose?</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>-pf "P=? [F (p1=maxval-M &amp; (F p1=0))]"
-const M=5:5:15 
-exportresults stdout
M       Result
6       1.1876357695852015E-10
10      1.0185162507865054E-8
15      4.902270837317093E-8
</code></pre></div>

<p>It's extraordinarily unlikely but becomes less extraordinarily likely when you start with more coins. And again we're just modeling until one player runs out of coins, so the odds are slightly (slightly) higher than this. </p>
<p>Finally, the chance the pot maxes out at <code>C0</code> coins:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code>-pf 'P=? [(F pot=C0) &amp; (G pot &lt;= C0)]'
-const M=10,C0=0:1:20
</code></pre></div>

<h3>Was this worth it?</h3>
<p>Ugh no I hate PRISM</p>
<p>But also I think I figured out a different approach to modeling this that would better handle adding players <em>and</em> running until just one player is left. Maybe that'll be a blog post for next Channukah!</p>

<h3>End of Year Administrative Stuff</h3>
<p>Next week will be the last newsletter of the year. Quick updates on this year's projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Logic for Programmers</em>: Haven't made any progress on it for a while, but a friend has kindly offered to help edit and keep me to a schedule, so I'm more optimistic for the next year.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Why programming languages doesn't have graph types</em>: Done with interviews, writing an outline!</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to write a new formal methods talk for next year, which would focus on the general history and idea of formal specification instead of just pitching TLA+ as a product. If you know any conference people who'd be interested, put me in touch!</p>
