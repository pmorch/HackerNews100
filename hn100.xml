<p dir="auto"><code>barco</code> is a project I worked on to learn more about Linux containers and the Linux kernel, based on other guides on the internet.
<code>barco</code> enforces a minimal set of restrictions to run untrusted code, which is not recommended for production use, where a more robust solution should be used. Some permissions however are absolutely not safe, and those are enforced by <code>barco</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Linux containers are made up by a set of Linux kernel features:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>namespaces</code>: are used to group kernel objects into different sets that can be accessed by specific process trees. There are different types of <code>namespaces</code>, for example,the <code>PID</code> namespace is used to isolate the process tree, while the <code>network</code> namespace is used to isolate the network stack.</li>
<li><code>seccomp</code>: is used to limit the system calls that a process can make (handled via syscalls)</li>
<li><code>capabilities</code>: are used to set limits on what uid 0 (root) can do (handled via syscalls)</li>
<li><code>cgroups</code>: are used to limit the resources (e.g. memory, disk I/O, CPU-tme) that a process can use (handled via cgroupfs)</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2>
<p dir="auto"><code>barco</code> can be used to run <code>bin/sh . </code> from the <code>/</code> directory as <code>root</code> with verbose output with the following command:</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Setup</h2>
<p dir="auto"><code>barco</code> requires a number of tools and libraries to be installed to build the project and for development.</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Dependencies</h3>
<p dir="auto"><code>barco</code> depends on the following "non-standard" libraries:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>libseccomp</code>: used to set up seccomp filters</li>
<li><code>libcap</code>: used to set container capabilities</li>
<li><code>libbsd</code>: used for <code>strlcpy</code></li>
<li><code>libcuni1</code>: used for testing with CUnit</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/rxi/log.c">rxi/log.c</a>: used for logging</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><code>barco</code> uses a number of LLVM-18-based tools for development, linting, formatting, debugging and checking for memory leaks.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Build</h2>
<p dir="auto">The included <code>Makefile</code> provides a few targets to build <code>barco</code>.
The variable <code>debug=1</code> can be set to run any of the targets in "debug" mode, which builds the project with the with debug symbols and without optimizations. The debug build is especially useful for the debugger and valgrind.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# Build barco (executable is in bin/)

$ make debug=1</pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Development</h2>
<p dir="auto"><code>barco</code> is developed using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="nofollow">Visual Studio Code</a> and <a href="https://github.com/codespaces">GitHub Codespaces</a>. The repository contains all the necessary configuration files to use these tools effectively.
<code>barco</code> relies on low-level Linux features, so it must be run on a Linux system. <a href="https://github.com/codespaces">GitHub Codespaces</a> acts weird at times when tweaking low-level container settings: I found <a href="https://getutm.app/" rel="nofollow">getutm.app</a> to work well with <a href="http://debian.org/" rel="nofollow">Debian</a> on my Mac when in doubt.</p>
<p dir="auto">The included <code>Makefile</code> provides a few targets useful for development:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# Run tests

<p dir="auto">Furthermore, the project includes a <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="nofollow">Visual Studio Code</a> configuration in <code>.vscode/</code> that can be used to run the built-in debugger (at this moment it is "disabled" since <code>barco</code> should be run as <code>root</code> and <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="nofollow">Visual Studio Code</a> does not have that option).</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Testing and documentation</h2>
<p dir="auto">At the moment, the project does not contain any automated tests or tools to document the code.
In the future, suitable tools for automated testing and documentation might be added.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Limitations</h2>
<p dir="auto"><code>barco</code> assumes that the host system is running a Linux kernel at version 6.0.x or higher and with user namespaces and cgroupsv2 enabled. The project has been tested on Debian 13.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>barco</code> does not handle network namespaces, so the container cannot access the network. Networking can roughly be setup as follows:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>create a new network namespace</li>
<li>create a virtual ethernet pair</li>
<li>move one end of the pair to the new network namespace</li>
<li>assign an IP address to the interface in the new network namespace</li>
<li>setup routing and NAT</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In C this is usually done via the <code>rtnetlink</code> interface. Furthermore, network usage can be limited with the <code>net_prio</code> cgroup controller.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Improvements</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Investigate further, document and refactor: user and mount and cgroup namespaces, syscalls and capabilities</li>
<li>The functions in <code>cgroups.c</code>, <code>mount.c</code>, <code>sec.c</code>, <code>userns.c</code> are specific to <code>barco</code> and should be made more generic</li>
<li>CMake and Conan are industry standards, so they should be used eventually instead of Make and the current build system. Unfortunately, CMake and Conan also add a lot of complexity which is not needed at this time.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-wrap">
<p><strong>I’ll tell you a secret about working in a massage parlour:</strong> it’s a lot of waiting around, usually late at night. We’d wait, half a dozen of us, in the dressing room as the evening wore on. On edge and exhausted in equal parts, we perched on the low-slung couch, adjusted the straps of our babydolls, listlessly fluffed our hair, ready to spring into action.</p>
<p><i>Girl, I’m going insane.</i></p>
<p><i>Oh please, I’m already there.</i></p>
<p>Then, we’d hear the front door open, the low murmur of a man’s voice, the chirp of the receptionist from the parlour’s reception desk. Some of us would circle the dressing room door, ready in case he wanted to see the lineup, curious if he had booked someone specific. Then, the methodical thwack of the receptionist’s pumps would sound down the long hallway as the girls swivelled towards her from their respective stations—pulling towels from the dryer, applying lipstick at the vanity, melting into the couch in a cloud of cigarettes and Pink Sugar perfume.</p>
<p>The receptionist would thrust four twenty-dollar bills into someone’s hand; maybe mine, maybe not. “You’re up. Sixty minutes in room four.” For the rest of the girls, the night wore on, dark and still.</p>
<p>Honestly, that’s most of working in a massage parlour: waiting around, wondering how much money you will—or won’t— make on any given shift. I know because I made my living that way for five years.</p>
<p><b>*</b></p>
<p>I was a university dropout in my early twenties when I started that gig, struggling to find my place in Toronto, a city where squalor and decadence collided behind the glass and steel of the downtown skyline. To get by, I took a job at a massage parlour in the northwest corner of the city, a place where factories stretched several blocks, separated by the odd strip mall full of nail salons, carpet dealers, banquet halls that morphed into after-hours clubs if you knew the right people. The garish yellow “M” of McDonald’s arched high over everything, like a gateway to another world. Because of the way Toronto zoning bylaws work, most body rub parlours are relegated to this part of the city, and after dark, “massage” signs wink and flash from almost every corner. <i>Finch Alley</i>, some people call it.</p>
<p>My regular shift at the parlour ran from 2 p.m. to 2 a.m., and I worked anywhere between three and six shifts a week, depending on how the cash was flowing. It was a job that was unbearably tangible at times, an onslaught of surgical scars and sun-damaged chests I rubbed oil over, the soft pallor of flesh under my hands that rarely saw the light of day. Yet it was also predicated on a precariously suspended reality, one I had to maintain with absolute precision to do my job well, to pretend that a profound mutual desire could be found for the low, low price of $80 in a strip mall off a freeway. In real life I wouldn’t dare be so giving. I can’t say I was particularly good at any of this by the time 2 a.m. rolled around, makeup melting off my face, puffiness blooming under my eyes, a rapidly dwindling patience for the reassurance some men desperately sought: <i>So, how was it for you?</i></p>
<p>The rabbit warren of hallways and thinly-walled rooms felt insular at that hour, the click of stilettos on laminate less urgent than during the day. A dampness I always associated with the night shift hung in the air, mingling with the smell of smoke and coconut air freshener. Night shift did not discriminate, and the men who wandered in after dark were as varied as they come: they were travelling on business or headed home from factory shifts, students taking a break from all-nighters, bros on their way back from the bar. They were tall and short and young and old, of every race and cultural background imaginable. You could never predict who would come in, except to say with certainty that they would want a level of womanly validation I was simply too tired to give. Half-dressed and exhausted, I often didn’t have the patience for their hands on me, the array of intimate requests they crept in seeking—<i>touch me, kiss me</i>, <i>make me an entirely different world than the one outside these doors</i>—when all I craved was the privacy of my own bed. My world outside the parlour was small—just a ground floor apartment in midtown Toronto that overlooked an alley, while a radiator clanked and hissed at all hours of the night and day. But it was a place where my thoughts, and my body, were my own.</p>
<p>Despite the demands of the job, there was a stillness to the nights I found alluring. There was a poise to the velvety darkness of parking lots, the soft buzz of neon lights shaped like palm trees, as if they were also waiting at attention for the inevitable flurry of activity that punctuated those long periods of quiet. People’s needs at 2 a.m. are equal parts fervent and fundamental, somehow stripped of all pretense by the cover of darkness. What do you need if you’re out seeking services at night? Food, sex, shelter. The staunch of a wound. Being part of that felt like a reprieve from the day’s complexities, a world which launched a steady barrage of information and demanded endless analyses, caring little for our overstimulated brains. The days were full of subway delays and deferred student loan payments, of agonizing small talk and headlines about inflation.</p>
<p>At night we’re just animals, I was reminded. The clients, yes, seeking release they couldn’t admit during daylight hours, but also the workers who manned the various portions of the strip mall after dark. The way we cared for each other, sometimes more in silent gestures than anything else, felt connected to our deepest instincts as pack animals. No matter how much I wanted to go home, there was some comfort in the simplicity of that connection.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Memory has a way of smoothing jagged edges, leaving us with a haze of nostalgia that overlooks the most painful parts of our past lives, so I can’t be sure how much I really miss the nights themselves and how much my brain is playing tricks on me. It defies logic that any part of me longs for the precarious earnings and long hours of massage parlour work, the exhaustive level of physical and emotional intimacy required, the shame that grew exponentially the farther away I slipped from what was once a promising journalism career. I do, however, know I miss the community it gave me membership to, the pack we inadvertently travelled in. I miss the silent language we developed, the way nothing was asked of me by other night shift workers, the sense that I was enough just by showing up.</p>
<p>Cab drivers—who are also paid in cash and depend on volume for their livelihood—would pick me up at the end of shift and commiserate, rosary beads swinging from their rearview mirrors as we pulled onto dark freeways. <i>How was </i><i>work? Busy?</i> They would ask. <i>No, not really</i>, I would say. <i>You</i>? As the cab whizzed down an eerily empty Gardiner Expressway, we’d laugh, try to unpack what made a slow shift or a busy one, what made people need us—or not. <i>A dearth of sports games. The end of the month. Tax refund season. Inertia</i>. Once, a cab broke down in a snowstorm on the highway while taking me home and the driver immediately phoned his friend, another driver, and gently walked me over to his cab, parked farther down the highway when it arrived. Snow hurled sideways at us, my driver’s tie flapping in the squall, his bare forearms braced against the cold. <i>Get home safe</i>, he told me, <i>please</i>.</p>
<p>Women filled my Styrofoam cup at the twenty-four-seven coffee shop across the street from the parlour, glancing wordlessly at the strip of bare skin between my coat and the tops of my stockings, but still making sure my cup was full to the top, passing me extra packets of sugar, sometimes a muffin from the day-old basket. Kids in their early twenties manned the counter at all-night fast-food joints, where I’d go between clients on slow shifts, needing something to wake up my neurons: salt, heat, grease. The shock of cold air on my legs at midnight. We knew so little about each other’s lives—how could we?—but forced into this strange cohort of ragged work hours, I felt we sometimes shared a look of recognition: of people whittling time away as we tended to the incessant hungers of others.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>When I finally did leave the sex trade after finishing my bachelor’s degree as a mature student, I spent seven years working in “good” jobs in the corporate sector. This meant, as I understood it, that I didn’t work nights, that I was a salaried employee, and that I had dental benefits. I had a shiny access card that opened doors—to a gleaming, marble elevator bank, to planters full of plastic ferns, to blocks of cubicles illuminated by fluorescent lighting, a land of perpetual daytime.</p>
<p>Unlike sex work, my “good” jobs didn’t threaten to overthrow traditional power structures. Many sex workers, including myself, have long hypothesized that the reason so many people in power work to keep the commercial sex trade marginalized is because they’re threatened by it—by the idea that it’s the only field where women outearn men, that it’s an industry where women get to call the shots, and that women profit off something that men have been told they’re entitled to for free: sex and attention in equal parts. In my experience of the corporate landscape, there was none of this radical power structure, only an upholding of the traditional: men talking and women listening, men in powerful positions getting both credit and profit for the labour of women beneath them. <i>Is this what I worked so hard for?</i> I wondered daily.</p>
<p>As I moved through this new world, merging into the throng of daytime professionals that swelled throughout the downtown core, absorbed by their smartphone screens, and proffering the barest morsels of small talk, I felt little of the camaraderie I once did while working night shifts. I’m unsure why I felt this dissonance, and it occurs to me now that it could have been more self-imposed than anything. Perhaps my experience in the parlours of Finch Alley felt so removed from what I perceived as the experience of my corporate colleagues and their “good life choices” that I created that distance myself, imposter syndrome as thick as the steam that rose from the downtown subway grates during the winter. When I was assigned a crisis communications task, which was often part of my job, I would try to cheer myself up by silently joking that after everything, my livelihood somehow still depended on men employing bad judgement. But there was nobody around who would understand, so the joke fell flat, even in my head.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I headed home from the office, stuffed onto a packed streetcar, I remembered nights when our strip mall felt like a kingdom, where we scurried from block to block like savvy woodland creatures, coats zipped over our lingerie, faces alight under the weak yellow streetlamps, dispatching coffee orders or supplies from clerks at the late-night convenience stores. Condoms. Baby oil. Hot Cheetos. “We know where <i>she</i> works,” their faces said, but it felt less like a judgement and more like an acknowledgement. We were in it together; an ecosystem of tending to each other’s needs, brazen and intimate at the same time.</p>
<p>Once I sat on the leather couch in the dressing room, which was just an extension built onto the massage parlour that housed an industrial-sized washer and dryer, a makeup table, and a precarious utility shelf crammed with supplies: towels, mineral oil, rubbing alcohol, Kleenex. Nursing a black tea, I steeled myself before my last appointment of the night. It was booked as an hour-long shower session, which I hated. Sixty minutes with a regular who would never say a word to me, who just wanted to touch my breasts as we slowly turned to prunes under the tepid water, while I tried to make each stifled yawn look like it was, in fact, a shiver of ecstasy. “I don’t know if I can make it,” I said, half joking but half imploring the five other girls who sat wedged on the couch with me, or sprawled on threadbare Ikea chairs.</p>
<p>“Baby, come sit by me,” said Cheryl, an attendant from Newfoundland in her early fifties with sun-crinkled skin the colour of almonds and a voice like gravel. I plodded over to where she sat at the makeup table and pulled up a stool.</p>
<p>“At least let me fix your hair,” she said. I complied.</p>
<p>Cheryl brushed my hair extensions out with her fingers, acrylic nails flashing, pink as Malibu. Then she took out a wide-barrel curling iron and meticulously worked my unruly hair into waves, smiling and humming periodically at her handiwork. “There,” she said when she was finished. “So pretty.”</p>
<p>I felt so much care in that moment I could barely breathe, and it occurred to me that I’d never had a woman, before or since, handle my hair so tenderly.</p>
<p>Once, the fire alarm went off in the office tower where I worked downtown. We crammed into the stairwell, lurching down dozens of flights. It was the most unscripted moment I had encountered since starting that office job and for a moment I marvelled at the chaos of it all: the unvarnished panic and confusion on people’s faces, the small gesture of kindness when I dropped my elevator card and someone picked it up for me. <i>Maybe this is it</i>, I thought. <i>Maybe this is when the adrenaline and uncertainty give way to something more human, where we seek relief in collective company</i>. <i>Maybe we’ll all go out for a drink and watch the fire trucks tend to the real emergency.</i> But when the final door banged open on ground level, spitting us out into the alley behind a steakhouse, everyone dispersed in separate directions, scattering as far as the eye could see.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/06/what-experts-say-eric-adams-gets-wrong-about-low-skilled-workers.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CMy%20low%20skill%20workers%20%E2%80%94%20my,We%20are%20in%20this%20together.%E2%80%9D">New York mayor Eric Adams was quoted</a> referring to cooks, fast-food workers, dishwashers and messengers as “low-skill workers,” proclaiming they simply don’t have the skills to “sit in a corner office.” Like Toronto, New York relies on a variety of minimum wage and night shift workers to keep its culture “vibrant”—a term often used in city-building and real estate circles—or at least convenient. In fact, according to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2015/article/night-owls-and-early-birds.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, more than fifteen million Americans work night shifts. <a href="https://www.carexcanada.ca/profile/shiftwork-occupational-exposures/">In Canada</a>, it’s closer to 1.8 million, or 12 percent of the working population. Could not a single one of those people have the “skills” to work in a corner office? When I read Adams’ quote, I was back, for the briefest of seconds, in that dark parking lot under a red-lit “massage” sign, watching the outline of a coffee shop server across the street as she wiped down the midnight counter, over and over. I thought of her thankless work and the comfort she provided to so many people moving through that transient space, the way she may have wanted to do something—anything—else with her time, but perhaps was not afforded the opportunity to. What a world in which her labour went unvalued, perhaps unnoticed altogether.</p>
<p>Adams’ comments ricocheted through social media for months, at one point resulting in a tweet about how most corner office professionals wouldn’t be able to handle even one overnight shift at Waffle House. But Adams isn’t alone in his simplistic view; many of the jobs that require overnight shifts are considered “low skill” roles by those in power, regardless of how essential they might be. How quickly the discourse moves from “frontline workers” to “low-skilled labourers” as soon as the concepts of unions or minimum wage increase make an appearance. This idea of night shift jobs being less desirable, work people do because they “have to,” not because they want to, is true sometimes. It was obvious to me that many in my night shift network were working gigs as a stopgap on the way to something else, but to me that never made any of us less deserving. In reality, I thought of us as some of the strongest, the most resourceful, the most skilled at defusing confrontations that often come with late-night interactions.</p>
<p>“You’re better than this job,” clients sometimes said to me while I was working nights. Often they’d say it in the awkward and delicate moments immediately after a session, as we towelled off together and I stripped the massage table—moments where men were often fraught with shame, resignation, and satiation in equal parts, and words tumbled clumsily from their mouths. They meant it as a compliment, but it was a sentiment I hated. <i>You’re better than this</i>. As though somewhere, there was a woman who wasn’t.</p>
<p>I’ve seen security guards diffuse a knife fight. I once watched a fast-food server placate a violent customer with nothing more than her voice and a stale honey cruller at her disposal. I’ve met few professionals since who I think could handle those wearying hours and even fewer who could still react with tact and effectiveness under pressure, especially considering the low, precarious wages these gigs often pay. Plus, there’s a danger to working jobs with these hours and demands on a long-term basis. Statistics have long shown that <a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797%252814%252900623-0/fulltext">people who work night shifts are more likely to battle stress, illness, even premature death</a>. Whether those late-night needs—for food, for sex—are real or perceived, as long as there’s a demand, profit-driven businesses will want to capitalize on it, perhaps at the very expense of the workers who take those shifts. The price we pay to keep cities thrumming and hungers satiated at all hours of the night and day is steep.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>It’s been years since I held a job requiring those kinds of late-night shifts. I woke recently at exactly 2 a.m., as I often do, pulled from slumber by some unnameable cue. I poured a glass of water and stood at my apartment window, suspended high above a ribbon of expressway. From behind the glass, everything was hushed at that hour. Then I reminded myself that an entire ecosystem still hums and clanks and keeps the world stitched together quietly: the municipal salt truck scattering brine down the street. The yellow sign of the twenty-four-seven grocery down the block advertising milk, bread, cigarettes. The wink of a red taillight as it trails across the expressway and flashes out of sight. I can’t, of course, know who it might be; perhaps another aimless man not ready to go home yet, rootless and restless and looking for validation in all the wrong places; perhaps another night shift worker on her way home, forming an unspoken understanding with her cab driver. Sometimes I think I have nothing to show for those years spent tending to people’s needs after hours, a period of my life as brief and transient as the red glow of that receding taillight. But I know the stories of the city after dark, and I keep those with me, always.</p>

		<p>

						August 2, 2023

		<div id="post-19611">
				<p>For months, supporters of Bill C-18, the Online News Act, assured the government that Meta and Google were bluffing when they warned that a bill based on mandated payments for links was unworkable and they would comply with it by removing links to news from their platforms. However, what has been readily apparent for months became reality yesterday: Meta is now <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/06/changes-to-news-availability-on-our-platforms-in-canada/">actively blocking</a> news links and sharing on its Facebook and Instagram platforms. The announcement does not reference Threads, but it would not surprise if news links are ultimately blocked on that platform as well. The company says that the blocking will take several weeks to fully roll out to all users, suggesting that it has learned from the over-blocking mistakes made in Australia and is proceeding more cautiously in Canada. By the end of the month, the world’s largest social media platform will become a news desert in Canada, with links to all news – both Canadian and foreign – blocked on the platform.</p>
<p>It is worth revisiting that it was only a couple of months ago that some industry leaders, lobbyists, and academics were assuring the Senate that the Meta threat was just a bluff. Kevin Desjardins of the Canadian Association of Broadcasters, referenced the Australian experience, and <a href="https://sencanada.ca/en/Content/Sen/Committee/441/TRCM/54EV-56205-E">told the Senate committee</a> studying the bill that “when legislated to do so, they will come to the table.” Sylvain Poisson of Hebdos Quebec <a href="https://sencanada.ca/en/Content/Sen/Committee/441/TRCM/54EV-56205-E">confidently</a> said “they made those threats in Australia and elsewhere and every time they back down.” Chris Pedigo of the U.S.-based Digital Context Next <a href="https://sencanada.ca/en/Content/Sen/Committee/441/TRCM/50EV-56141-E">assured the committee</a> “it’s important to understand what happens when these bills become law. In Australia, they moved quickly to secure deals. They have done similar work in Europe, and I expect it would happen quickly in Canada as well.” And Carleton professor Dwayne Winseck said “I am not worried. The threats they are making, they are doing this all around the world.”</p>
<p>Despite the assurances, the company was true to its word and blocking news links is now here. If this is a negotiation tactic, it’s a pretty strange one given that reports indicate the company is not talking to the government about potential changes to a law that has already received royal assent. Indeed, while the new Heritage Minister Pascale St-Onge <a href="https://twitter.com/mgeist/status/1686486790054572032?s=20">urged the company to participate in the regulatory process</a>, there is nothing in the regulations that could alter the fundamental principle in the bill of mandated payments for links. At best, the government could toss aside its commitment to stay out of negotiations by using the regulations to dictate to the supposedly independent CRTC how much needs to be spent in order to avoid Bill C-18’s final offer arbitration provisions. Government negotiating total payment value and eviscerating the CRTC’s independence does not inspire confidence and Meta reasonably wants no part of it, since the time to fix Bill C-18 was before it received royal assent, not after.</p>
<p>It is difficult to overstate the harm that Bill C-18 will create for the media sector in Canada, with enormous losses that will run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Indeed, just the exit of Meta will lead to the losses that include the cancellation of existing deals, lost links that accounts for as much as 30% of referral traffic, and no new revenues from Bill C-18 from one of the two platforms that were supposed to fall under the law. The move virtually guarantees that Bill C-18 will represent a setback for the sector and a cautionary tale for a government that blithely ignored the warning signs, seemed to welcome a fight with the tech companies, and had no Plan B. In fact, if Google follows suit, there will be even more cancelled deals, lost links, and absolutely no new revenues from the legislation given that those are the only companies subject to the law (former Heritage Minister Pablo Rodriguez’s insistence that there is value in links that deserve compensation while simultaneously excluding Microsoft, Apple, Twitter and other platforms from the law amply demonstrates how the argument stands on shaky grounds).</p>
<p>As disbelief has shifted to acceptance, Canadian media outlets are now rushing to promote direct access to their content via web, email or any other non-social media platform. The government is also seemingly hoping to drum up support for its ad boycott of Meta, yet given that the <a href="https://twitter.com/mgeist/status/1686489588976488448?s=20">Liberal party launched new ads on Facebook just this week</a>, that may be a hard sell. Instead, having rejected alternatives that could have avoided this outcome, the government has remarkably created a lose-lose-lose-lose scenario.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Canadian media is a loser, particularly the small and independent media outlets that are more reliant on social media to develop community and build their audience. The loss of Facebook links will take a serious toll and undermine innovative companies in Canada. The Internet platforms are losers as they comply with an unreasonable law by removing links and making their services objectively worse in order to do so. Individual Canadians who use the platforms to find links to news are losers since news links will be blocked from the platform. And the government is a loser, as having dismissed critics and ignored repeated warnings about the risks associated with its bill, it has now left Canada as the global example of digital policy disastrously gone wrong. <span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://dottedmag.net/blog/libvirt-14-pcie-devices/">https://dottedmag.net/blog/libvirt-14-pcie-devices/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37023885">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>You might have used <code>libvirt</code>, a Linux daemon that provides an abstraction
and management layer for virtualization software. This daemon allows you
to submit an XML file containing a description of a VM, disk image or network.
<code>libvirt</code> is then able to configure, start it and keep it running.</p>
<p>There is a peculiar limitation in VMs started by <code>libvirt</code>:
<a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1408810">they can only support up to 14 hotpluggable PCIe slots</a>.
Attempting to start a VM with 15 PCIe slots will fail.</p>
<p>14 seems like an absurdly low number, so why exactly 14? It turns out
this is the result of a chain of events that began in 1970.</p>
<h2 id="datapoint-2200-and-intel-8008">Datapoint 2200 and Intel 8008</h2>
<p><img src="https://dottedmag.net/blog/libvirt-14-pcie-devices/dp2200.jpg" alt="Datapoint 2200"></p>
<p>In June 1970, the Computer Terminal Corporation announced
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datapoint_2200">Datapoint 2200</a>, a programmable
computer terminal.</p>
<p>The Datapoint 2200 contained a primitive CPU, two of its instructions being <code>INP</code>/<code>OUT</code>.
These instructions were designed to read or write one byte of data from one
of 8 input/output ports.</p>
<p><img src="https://dottedmag.net/blog/libvirt-14-pcie-devices/8008.jpg" alt="Intel 8008"></p>
<p>Intel was tasked with consolidating a number of discrete modules in the Datapoint 2200
into one, and they came up with Intel 8008, a one-chip CPU that implemented the same
instruction set.</p>
<h2 id="intel-8080">Intel 8080</h2>
<p><img src="https://dottedmag.net/blog/libvirt-14-pcie-devices/8080.jpg" alt="Intel 8080"></p>
<p>When Intel engineers had set out to develop a new product that eventually became
known as the Intel 8080, they were definitely inspired by the 8008 instruction set,
so the 8080 ISA contains the <code>IN</code>/<code>OUT</code> instructions, though they extended to 256
addresses.</p>
<p>I’m not a hardware engineer, so I’m not entirely sure why this CPU retained the
separate I/O address space instead of using memory-mapped peripherals like other CPUs.
I’ll defer to <a href="https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/a/25528">this explanation</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>it made peripherals cheaper</li>
<li>it didn’t hog the very limited address space; the 8080 only had 64 KiB available.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="intel-8086-pc-and-x86-64">Intel 8086, PC and x86-64</h2>
<p><img src="https://dottedmag.net/blog/libvirt-14-pcie-devices/8086.jpg" alt="Intel 8086"></p>
<p>Intel 8086 was designed to simplify porting of software from the 8080, so it retained
the I/O instructions in the ISA. However, it expanded their addresses to full 16 bit,
allowing 65536 I/O ports.</p>
<p>The IBM PC <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output_base_address">extensively used</a>
I/O ports for peripherals such as the interrupt controller, system timer and keyboard.
These ports have been enshrined in PC-compatible computers ever since, although
their usage has decreased over time.</p>
<p>However, unlike the memory address space, which grew from 64 KiB in 8080 to 1 MiB in 8086,
and to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_5-level_paging">128PiB in Ice Lake</a>, I/O address
space has remained fixed at 65536 addresses.</p>
<h2 id="pci">PCI</h2>
<p><img src="https://dottedmag.net/blog/libvirt-14-pcie-devices/pci.jpg" alt="PCI"></p>
<p>In 1990, Intel started developing a new computer bus to replace MCA and EISA,
eventually known as PCI.</p>
<p>This bus acknowledged the need for peripherals to communicate with the host via shared
memory, however it also provided the option for a PCI device to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_Component_Interconnect#PCI_address_spaces">reserve a range
of I/O ports</a>.
Unlike the orignial PC, this reservation is not fixed; however the reserved
range had to be continuous.</p>
<p>I can only guess why the new bus has such an x86-specific feature. It might have
been a design decision made to simplify the adaptation of hardware peripherals
that utilize I/O ports to a new bus. Or it might have been the result of Intel
engineers designing the specification to match Intel hardware.</p>
<h2 id="pci-bridges">PCI bridges</h2>
<p>I/O ports reservation would not be a big issue: it was an optional feature,
so if no cards were plugged in that requested it, no I/O ports would have
to be reserved.</p>
<p>However, engineers working on the PCI specification developed
<a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/551427/files/cer-2308933.pdf">PCI bridges</a>
as a way to increase the address space of the bus, as a PCI bus without bridges
can only contain 63 devices.</p>
<p>To handle PCI devices that request ranges of I/O ports, a PCI bridge
must reserve I/O ports for itself. PCI does not support dynamic port allocation,
so every bridge must reserve I/O ports upon powering on.</p>
<p>Moreover, PCI bridge specification states that the reservation granularity
of I/O ports is 4K, so every bridge must allocate a minimum of 4K of I/O ports
to handle a PCI card that requests as few as one port.</p>
<p>PCI bridges were quite static hardware, so this was not a major consideration
when the bridges were introduced. Several 4096 I/O port blocks were allocated
from a 65536 I/O address space, and provided the PCI bus was not extraordinarily
large, it generally worked out well.</p>
<h2 id="pcie">PCIe</h2>
<p><img src="https://dottedmag.net/blog/libvirt-14-pcie-devices/pcie.jpg" alt="PCIe"></p>
<p>In 2003, the PCI Express bus was created to replace the PCI and maintain
backwards compatibility.</p>
<p>Due to compatibility considerations, any PCIe slot is represented in the PCI
hierarchy as a PCI bridge.</p>
<p>You can see where it is going:</p>
<ul>
<li>The PCI bridge must request at least 4K contiguous I/O ports to serve cards
that request I/O ports,</li>
<li>Every PCIe slot is a PCI bridge,</li>
<li>Thus, the maximum total number of PCIe slots in any PC is 16 (= 65536/4096).
However, the actual number will be less, given the presence of legacy PC devices,
especially in virtualized environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>The designers of PCIe have recognized this limitation and stipulated that any
PCIe hardware must still be functional if its I/O port request is not fulfilled.</p>
<h2 id="qemu">QEMU</h2>
<p>QEMU <a href="https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/qemu-devel/patch/1501964858-5159-5-git-send-email-zuban32s@gmail.com/#20795751">has an option</a>
for PCIe root ports to disable I/O allocation.</p>
<p>I’m at loss as to why it’s off by default. Could there be configurations where
this is not going to work, such as PCI device plugged into PCIe-&gt;PCI bridge?</p>
<p>Anyway, the option is available, and if used, the amount of PCIe slots
in the QEMU machine won’t be limited to 16 (it will instead be limited by the number
of PCI bus numbers, as each PCI bridge uses one number, but that’s a different
story).</p>
<h2 id="libvirt">libvirt</h2>
<p><img src="https://dottedmag.net/blog/libvirt-14-pcie-devices/libvirt.png" alt="libvirt logo"></p>
<p>Given that QEMU has provided this option for some time, one might think
it’s simply a matter of adding another option to the libvirt domain definition.</p>
<p>It already supports a number of obscure options (you can make QEMU claim to
support a CPU feature regardless of whether the host CPU supports it, really?), so
adding one more would fit in just fine.</p>
<p>Nope. <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1408810">“there are no plans to address it further or fix it in an upcoming release”</a>.</p>
<p>So if you wish to have more than 14 PCIe slots in your VM, you’ll have to use
QEMU directly.</p>

<p>Zoom is asking all of its employees to return to the office for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic began, when the tech company blew up as one of the main means of communication for people forced to work from home.</p>



<p>Zoom, which remains a leader in the post-pandemic remote work trend, is now asking all employees within 50 miles of a company office to go in at least two days a week on a hybrid schedule.</p>



<p>“We believe that a structured hybrid approach – meaning employees that live near an office need to be onsite two days a week to interact with their teams – is most effective for Zoom,” a spokesperson <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/zoom-tells-employees-return-to-office-remote-work-video-conferencing-2023-8">told Business Insider</a> in a statement. “As a company, we are in a better position to use our own technologies, continue to innovate, and support our global customers.”</p>

<p>The San Jose-based company’s shares <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/09/01/zoom-shares-up-over-35-percent-after-monster-second-quarter/">skyrocketed</a> six-fold in 2020 when the pandemic left millions of employees who needed to connect with coworkers online stranded in their homes, according to the outlet. Zoom quickly emerged as the go-to video conferencing service.</p>



<p>Towards the end of 2021, however, Zoom’s stock <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/11/23/zoom-shares-drop-18-amid-slowed-revenue-growth/">plummeted</a> and the company has since lost at least $100 billion in market value.</p>



<p>The stock stagnated again this year as workers have returned to their offices across the country, cutting the reliance on video communications, Business Insider reported.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><em><span>Welcome to BIG, a newsletter on the politics of monopoly power. If you’d like to sign up to receive issues over email, you can do so </span><a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/subscribe" rel="">here</a><span>.</span></em></p><p>Since 1890, there have been a few antitrust trials that shaped the biggest corporations in America. Standard Oil. American Tobacco. U.S. Steel. Alcoa. AT&amp;T. IBM. Microsoft. These cases are almost always against high-tech firms that control a key sector of the economy, and win or lose, they determine what our society looks like going forward.</p><p>Because of a ruling last week, we’re about to add Google to that list of famous corporations facing a monopolization claim by the government. For two months this fall, a judge named Amit Mehta, who is presiding over this antitrust case against Google, will become one of the most important economic policymakers in the world.</p><p><span>Judge Mehta will be this important because of Google’s outsized place in our society. The firm knows more about most people than their families, answering intimate questions from billions of us, every day, and controlling much of our communications to boot. It has 95% market share in search, annual revenue of a little less than $300 billion, and 15 products with more than 500 million users. We’ve perhaps never seen any corporate asset as powerful as Google search, with marketing professor Scott Galloway going so far as to say in 2017 that “</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyH3LWJdmaE" rel="">Google is God</a><span>.” </span></p><p><span>And at trial, Google will use that dominance as its main narrative, essentially saying 'Why are you picking on us? Our search engine is awesome!

And that’s because of the historical importance of the AT&amp;T antitrust case, shown to all who enter the building and pass that hall. The D.C. district court matters because of big swings like that one, because of judges like Greene.</p><p>Greene was an immigrant, and an extraordinary American. Born in Germany in 1923, he fled the Nazis, enlisted in the U.S. Army during World War II, and then went to night school. He ended up at the Justice Department, where he helped draft the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965. In 1978, Jimmy Carter put him on the court as a district judge. </p><p><span>A few years later, Greene issued a ruling finding that AT&amp;T was </span><a href="https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-american-tel-and-tel-co-4" rel="">monopolizing</a><span> a ‘broad variety’ of telecommunications equipment and services. AT&amp;T, realizing it was going to lose, agreed with the Justice Department to break itself up. Greene was a fair man, but no fool. He was highly attuned to the vagaries of political corruption and what Congress meant in passing various antitrust laws, such as the Tunney Act, to let judges block corrupt consent decrees between the government and powerful firms. Greene even disparaged earlier settlements with AT&amp;T by the Department of Justice as “blatantly inequitable and improper,” and demanded one that would fulfill the “goal of de-concentrating AT&amp;T's vast economic power.” </span></p><p><span>And so it did. The break-up delivered. Rates soon came down for consumers, but far more importantly, there was a </span><a href="https://www.promarket.org/2023/02/20/when-considering-breaking-up-big-tech-we-should-look-back-to-att/" rel="">massive explosion of innovation</a><span>, including, in all likelihood, the development of the internet and mobile telephony. It’s hard to overstate the impact of this decision, ushering as it did in the modern telecommunications era. (Greene was known for a time as the ‘father’ of telecommunications law.)</span></p><p><span>And this remarkably beneficial change happened because the case landed in the lap of a man with a deep perspective on power and life. “I guess my tendency is, in a sense, to be for the person who appears to be pushed around,” Greene </span><a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/1984/0709/070916.html" rel="">said</a><span> in an interview about how he understood the law as an instrument of fairness for those without power. This isn’t to say Greene always ruled in favor of the little guy, he knew anyone could violate the law. But he did recognize the temptations of power, which he saw up close in Nazi Germany. “I never think my past experience has anything to do with my judicial philosophy,” he said, “but one thing you do learn living in a dictatorship is that there is no impartial law.” Fairness was intrinsic to Greene’s thinking, so he was willing to follow the statute laid out by Congress, even if that meant applying the law as written to an iconic center of concentrated power in America.</span></p><p><span>This fall, another immigrant jurist, Judge Amit Mehta, will take up Greene’s mantle, in the same building displaying a cartoon of the great man tangled up in phone cords. Last week, Mehta </span><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.626.0_2.pdf" rel="">ruled</a><span> that today’s giant monopoly, Google, must face the Department of Justice Antitrust Division, as well as state attorneys general, in a trial over whether it has monopolized the search market. Mehta issued an opinion on summary judgment in which he stated that the accusations laid out by the plaintiffs, if proved at trial, show that Google’s business model is illegal, and that the firm might need to be split up. </span></p><p>The case coming to trial was first brought under Trump in 2020 and continued by Biden. It is also the first monopolization case brought to trial by the Antitrust division in 25 years, since Microsoft in 1998. </p><p><span>What’s the allegation in the case? The government </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/how-a-google-antitrust-case-could" rel="">argues</a><span> that Google has a monopoly of general search and search advertising, roughly 90-95% of the market. Google has maintained this monopoly, the government alleges, not by making a better product, but by locking down everywhere that consumers might be able to find a different search engine option, and making sure they only see Google.</span></p><p><span>How does Google lock out rivals? Well, it pays </span><a href="https://fourweekmba.com/traffic-acquisition-cost/" rel="">$45 billion a year</a><span> to have distributors refuse to carry its competitor’s products, </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1328941/download" rel="">signing deals</a><span> with “Apple, LG, Motorola, and Samsung; major U.S. wireless carriers such as AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon; and browser developers such as Mozilla, Opera, and UCWeb— to secure default status for its general search engine and, in many cases, to specifically prohibit Google’s counterparties from dealing with Google’s competitors.”</span></p><p>Essentially, Google has bought up all of the shelf space where search is placed in front of consumers, which is to say browsers and phones. This behavior is very similar to what Microsoft did in the 1990s, when it bundled its browser with its operating system, and signed deals with ISPs to block its browser rival Netscape from getting access to customers. The analogy isn’t a coincidence, as the Microsoft case is controlling precedent. </p><p><span>It should be a slam-dunk case, and not just because Google search has become much much worse over the last five to ten years, packed increasingly with ads and poor results. To understand why this case makes sense, look no further than the experience of Neeva, a search engine </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23802382/search-engine-google-neeva-android" rel="">whose quality</a><span> was as high or higher than that of Google, but died a few months ago because it just couldn’t get access to customers. Neeva, according to David Pierce in </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23802382/search-engine-google-neeva-android" rel="">the Verge</a><span>, was “running an AI product, a full-stack search engine, and a privacy-first browser… If people went through all the bother of switching, they became converts,” Pierce wrote. “The problem was that very few of them managed to make it past the thicket of default settings and redirections.”</span></p><p>I actually used Neeva, and it was excellent, an innovative service better than Google. But as all defaults are set to Google, there are an endless number of screens encouraging people to set their search engine to that of the search giant. So Neeva, despite its quality, couldn’t get in front of potential customers. It died.</p><p><span>These default settings and redirections are what’s on trial, because that’s what killed Neeva, and prevents anyone from investing in the next search competitor. If Google is found guilty and disciplined reasonably by being broken apart and having a </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/how-russian-antitrust-enforcers-defeated" rel="">choice screen</a><span> imposed, then the new technologies of machine learning/AI will be deployed in a competitive marketplace, with immense possibilities similar to those after the AT&amp;T break-up. And it’s not just newcomers like Neeva who could compete. In 2020, the Financial Times reported that </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fd311801-e863-41fe-82cf-3d98c4c47e26" rel="">Apple is preparing its own search engine</a><span> in case its deal with Google falls apart due to this very antitrust case.  </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc84eaf41-1d7f-4759-97c1-eef758cc7834_578x431.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc84eaf41-1d7f-4759-97c1-eef758cc7834_578x431.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc84eaf41-1d7f-4759-97c1-eef758cc7834_578x431.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc84eaf41-1d7f-4759-97c1-eef758cc7834_578x431.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc84eaf41-1d7f-4759-97c1-eef758cc7834_578x431.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc84eaf41-1d7f-4759-97c1-eef758cc7834_578x431.png" width="578" height="431" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c84eaf41-1d7f-4759-97c1-eef758cc7834_578x431.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:431,&quot;width&quot;:578,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:72424,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc84eaf41-1d7f-4759-97c1-eef758cc7834_578x431.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc84eaf41-1d7f-4759-97c1-eef758cc7834_578x431.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc84eaf41-1d7f-4759-97c1-eef758cc7834_578x431.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc84eaf41-1d7f-4759-97c1-eef758cc7834_578x431.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>So if the government wins, we’ll see immense innovation and new entrants. If Google wins, however, then machine learning/AI will be deployed consistent with how Google, and perhaps Microsoft, chooses to deploy them, which is to say, slowly, un-creatively, and in service to monopoly power. </p><p>In many ways, cases like these are why Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890, and why antitrust laws are considered the ‘Magna Carta of free enterprise.’ The inflection point here is like that of telecom in the 1980s - would we be a society of walled gardens controlled by AT&amp;T, or one with competition where consumers could get access to this thing called… the internet? That’s the question Greene answered, with courage and wisdom. And now Mehta gets his shot to answer that same question.</p><p>But the stakes, and the merits of the case, are about where the similarities between these two periods end. When Greene presided over the AT&amp;T trial, America was a much more equal society, and there simply weren’t very many monopolies. AT&amp;T was an anomaly, a regulated monopoly whose long distance business was being assaulted by MCI and new ways of carrying voice transmission. There was also a fairly robust regulatory apparatus - the Federal Communications Commission hadn’t yet been gutted, and many states regulated phone prices effectively as well. Moreover, antitrust precedent was pretty good, judges were mostly not libertarians, and the corporate world accepted the rule of law as a meaningful check on their behavior.</p><p><span>This is not to say the politics of the case were easy. The Defense Department and the Commerce Department opposed the case, and Ronald Reagan was highly and explicitly favorable to big business. Moreover, the case had been inherited from the Carter administration, and Reagan had a very different view of antitrust. Indeed, his antitrust chief, Bill Baxter, </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/the-secret-plot-to-unleash-corporate" rel="">mostly ended antitrust enforcement</a><span>, dropping the major IBM challenge that had been pursued since the 1960s. But in the case of AT&amp;T, Baxter sought to litigate this particular complaint “to the eyeballs.” There was a very Reaganite rationale to his aggression. Baxter did not care that AT&amp;T was a monopoly, but believed in deregulation, and thought the regulated part of AT&amp;T was unfairly cross-subsidizing its position in long distance. It was an unusual situation, not just Greene getting the case in his lap, but Baxter’s ideological inflexibility and genuine good faith.</span></p><p><span>Today, almost everything is different. Let’s start with the judge. Mehta is an immigrant, but other than that, his career tracks very much like the technocratic elites characterizing most of our judges. He does not have the experiences of Greene, who saw in the Nazis just how dangerous concentrated power truly can be. By contrast, Mehta grew up in a suburb of Maryland, worked at the big law firm Latham and Watkins for a few years of training, was a public defender in D.C., and then served as a white collar defense attorney. This isn’t to say Mehta is hostile to antitrust, he </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/judge-in-google-lawsuit-presided-over-major-antitrust-case-11603293204" rel="">did block </a><span>the merger of Sysco and US Foods, though that one was fairly obvious. It’s just that Mehta is mostly a creature of D.C., and he doesn’t, as far as I can tell, have a strong record of recognizing the threat of concentrated corporations, or an instinctive skepticism of the powerful. </span></p><p><span>We can already see some problematic choices from Mehta. Google executives, including its CEO Sundar Pichai, have been found, in </span><a href="https://sfstandard.com/technology/judge-sanctions-google-for-deleting-internal-chat-logs-central-to-antitrust-cases/" rel="">multiple cases</a><span>, including this one, of </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-says-google-destroyed-evidence-related-to-antitrust-lawsuit-5dad2d6" rel="">destroying evidence</a><span> related to potential antitrust violations. Apparently, chat logs involving discussions over antitrust </span><a href="https://sfstandard.com/technology/group-suing-google-claims-ceo-sundar-pichai-involved-in-deleting-evidence/" rel="">show</a><span> “that Pichai personally asked whether a chat group’s history could be turned off and then attempted to delete that message.” A different judge in California sanctioned Google for this bad behavior, but not Mehta. Indeed, Mehta has fretted about document destruction, but so far has done nothing. This kind of bad faith behavior by Google, and lack of sanctioning from Mehta, is exactly what Judge Greene would never have tolerated. It is a statement through inaction that the law doesn’t apply to the powerful.</span></p><p><span>One reason for this kind of behavior is that the America in which Mehta is operating is different than the America of Greene’s era. In 1982, AT&amp;T was a one-off, a regulated monopoly in a generally competitive corporate American order. Google, by contrast, is a pace setter of an America that is now full of monopolies, because of the lack of antitrust enforcement for decades. Today, corporate executives see the law as mere suggestions, and generally believe they can get away with anything. Judges have adopted an attitude of deference to corporate power, as Mehta did on document destruction. (This isn’t unique to judges; Merrick Garland’s former spokesperson, Anthony Coley, is </span><a href="https://twitter.com/AnthonyColey/status/1687553360478552065" rel="">a cheerleader for Google</a><span> and even implied his former boss is engaged in unethical actions in litigating a Trump-era case.) </span></p><p>There is also a loss of faith in American institutions writ broadly, which differs from the 1980s. At the same time as he’s been dealing with Google, Mehta is presiding over trials of January 6th perpetrators, a showcase of the deep fissures that simply did not exist decades earlier. One result is that the politics of corporate power is very different, and that antitrust is on a generational and bipartisan upswing. (Indeed, Trump’s Attorney General Bill Barr brought the case, Biden’s antitrust chief, Jonathan Kanter, is continuing it.)</p><p>The net effect is that Mehta is an important actor here, but not as important as Greene. The case is likely to be appealed, probably all the way to the Supreme Court. And if the Supreme Court erodes antitrust caselaw against Google, then Congress will be confronted with the reality that it is hard to use the existing antitrust laws to address big tech. But ultimately if no cases against dominant firms succeed, then eventually Congress will change the law. Moreover, this case isn’t a one-off; the environment is less like AT&amp;T in 1982, or even Microsoft in 1998, and more like that of the turn of the 19th century, when Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson brought dozens of cases against dominant firms. This is one chapter in the fight over corporate power, but not the only one.</p><p>So far, I’ve laid out the arguments in the case, and the historical context. But what about Google? What do they say about the allegations? Google’s essential argument is that search is about economies of scale, and that it owns the whole market because consumers prefer its search engine to rivals. While Google may engage in behavior to exclude competitors, it needs to do so to get the data to improve its search engine. </p><p><span>Fundamentally, Google argues, its ability to exclude others is a good deal for America. Consumers love Google search so much that its monopoly is legal. As Google lawyer John Schmidtlein put it, “conduct that is a superior product</span><em> </em><span>or competition on the merits cannot, as a matter of law, violate the antitrust laws, regardless of its effect</span><em>.</em><span>” Basically, Google argues, we can do whatever we want as long as we can show consumers are happy.</span></p><p><span>While this argument isn’t necessarily persuasive to me, it is a very strong narrative to someone like Mehta. To people like us, it’s clear that Google is coasting, and produces an increasingly shoddy product. (As one ex-Googler </span><a href="https://medium.com/@pravse/the-maze-is-in-the-mouse-980c57cfd61a" rel="">recently put it</a><span>, “Google has 175,000+ capable and well-compensated employees who get very little done.”) Google used to be magic, but that was 10 years ago. Today search increasingly sucks, full of too many ads and crappy results </span><a href="https://themarkup.org/google-the-giant/2020/07/28/google-search-results-prioritize-google-products-over-competitors" rel="">peddled for Google’s own self-interest</a><span>. For </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/19/google-search-results-monopoly/" rel="">instance</a><span>, as the Washington Post noted in 2020:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>The </span><a href="https://archive.org/web/" rel="">Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine</a><span> stored some Google search results over the years. When we look back, a picture emerges of how Google increasingly fails us. There’s more space dedicated to ads that look like search results. More results start with answer “snippets” — sometimes incorrect — ripped from other sites. And increasingly, results point you back to Google’s own properties such as Maps and YouTube, where it can show more ads and gather </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/21/google-chrome-has-become-surveillance-software-its-time-switch/?itid=lk_inline_manual_13" rel="">more of your data</a><span>.</span></p></blockquote><p>Many judges believe what corporate executives say, and so Mehta is likely to hear from Google’s CEO that economies of scale are all that drives product quality, and he may buy that. </p><p>I bet Google executives believe that as well. Still, such an argument isn’t very different from what every monopoly has always argued; Standard Oil discussed how it brought cheap kerosene to the masses, AT&amp;T stressed its awesome quality and universal service, and Alcoa said that its control over aluminum was a result of its focus and dedication to America. Monopolists always believe they are serving humanity, but Congress made it clear by passing antitrust laws that monopolies, whatever they may say or think, are not actually doing that. And the evidence, from Standard Oil’s break-up leading to the development of gasoline to the suit against IBM creating the software industry, suggests Congress was right.</p><p>Last week, Mehta ruled in the summary judgment stage, which is the part where the judge decides what the trial will be about. Trials clear up factual and legal disputes, so the decision this week was about which disputes should be litigated. What Mehta ruled is most of the Antitrust Division’s case is good to go. </p><p>Google’s main argument to get the case dismissed was that the various contracts to set Google as the default search engine weren’t exclusive, since consumers and partners could technically choose other search engines to use if they wanted to. Mehta rejected this argument, and said that the issue would be decided at trial. That was a big loss for Google. There were a few technical areas where Google narrowed the path for the Antitrust Division to win, but the core of the case is on to trial.</p><p>The main win for Google was on the state attorneys general case, led by Colorado. Colorado made bigger claims than the DOJ, arguing that Google self-preferenced its own reviews ahead of Yelp’s, or its own travel services ahead of those like Expedia. Judge Mehta tossed these claims, saying that services like Yelp and Expedia aren’t general search engines and are therefore not in the same market as Google. It was a highly technical and annoying way to read certain legal questions, but bringing an antitrust case has become virtually impossible unless it’s done perfectly. Fortunately, a lot of the case survived.</p><p>The net effect is that a trial will start on September 12 and go for roughly two months. Depending on what happens, there may be additional time spent on a remedy, or it may go on appeal. As witnesses testify, from Google executives to rivals, we’re going to learn an enormous amount about how the internet developed, how advertising is sold, and why decisions about what we search for happen the way they do. It’s pretty disconcerting so much key evidence was destroyed, but it will still be a massively educational experience.</p><p><span>This trial, and even the case, isn’t the end. There are other cases that Google has to deal with into the fall and next year. For instance, Judge James Donato is allowing a class action trial over Google’s app store monopoly in November, which could cost Google tens of billions of dollars in damages. And in another case, Google has been trying to keep an antitrust claim from the state of Texas and a bunch of state AGs in New York, but a judicial panel </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/judicial-panel-refuses-pause-return-texas-lawsuit-against-google-2023-08-03/" rel="">just ruled</a><span> that the case will go back to be heard in Texas. Then there’s the Federal government’s trial in Virginia on Google’s monopolization of the software underpinning most online advertising. Other parts of the firm, like Google Maps, are </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/02/22/doj-google-maps-antitrust-probe-00084058" rel="">being investigated</a><span> as well. </span></p><p>I can’t say this trial will work out one way or the other. Given his passivity as Google destroyed documents, Judge Mehta has aways to go before he lives up to the legacy of Harold Greene. But I don’t want to assume anything, or be unfair to Mehta. After all, current antitrust caselaw is much weaker than it was in 1982. And frankly, the case is bigger than Mehta, or the D.C. Circuit judges who will hear an appeal, or perhaps even the Supreme Court. The public is actually engaged in a way they haven’t been in our lifetimes. Ten years ago, the FTC shut down a monopolization case against Google with a 5-0 vote, and zero controversy. That would never happen today. Indeed, regardless of how Mehta rules, it’s going to be a big deal.</p><p>Reviving laws to constrain corporate power takes time, as people within many institutions must change their minds, and come to grips with the choice of living in a free society or one dominated by monopolies. Fortunately, that change is happening. In September and October, we’ll start to see some of the fruits of that change. And hopefully, Judge Mehta will live up to the legacy of the D.C. district court, set forty one years ago by the courage of Harold Greene.</p><p><span>Thanks for reading!

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/08/06/baldurs-gate-3-prepared-for-100000-concurrent-players-theyve-gotten-700000/">https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/08/06/baldurs-gate-3-prepared-for-100000-concurrent-players-theyve-gotten-700000/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37023089">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure role="presentation"><figcaption><fbs-accordion><p>Baldur's Gate 3</p></fbs-accordion><small>Larian</small></figcaption></figure>
<p>I am running out of ways to describe not just what a success Baldur’s Gate 3 is, but on a scale that no one, not even its developer Larian, predicted.</p>

<p>Larian’s Swen Vincke posted a tweet yesterday showing the game hitting 500,000 concurrent players, making it the third most played game on all of Steam behind only CSGO and DOTA 2. He said that he told IT to only expect 100,000 concurrents at max.</p>


<p>That gap has widened even further. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" target="_blank" title="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" aria-label="peak yesterday was 712,281 players">peak yesterday was 712,281 players</a>, surpassing games like DOTA 2, Rust, Apex Legends, GTA 5 and PUBG. Mind you, this is a single player, hardcore RPG.</p>


<p>Past that, Baldur’s Gate has now broken into the top 10 peak playercounts in Steam history. It’s currently #9, getting dangerously close to Hogwarts Legacy’s 879,308, a high water mark from earlier this year. Above those two are New World, Elden Ring, Cyberpunk 2077, Dota 2, Lost Ark, CSGO and PUBG. There are only four single players games out of the top 10, as others are MMOs or PvP games.</p>

<p>I think that Baldur’s Gate might push even higher later today, as I’ve seen playercounts peak for many games on Sundays. While it’s not impossible the following weekend is higher, that’s a bit unlikely, as these all-time peaks often happen early on. But anything can happen, and Baldur’s Gate has already defied all kinds of odds.</p>

<p>We don’t know what exact sales are for Baldur’s Gate 3’s PC-only release is, but they previously moved up the date to better avoid bigger fall games, and clearly it worked. The game does not have more than <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/baldurs-gate-3?ref=hp" target="_blank" title="https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/baldurs-gate-3?ref=hp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/baldurs-gate-3?ref=hp" aria-label="four scored reviews">four scored reviews</a> in right now, but given all the praise, even in a year of a megahit like Tears of the Kingdom and a AAA blockbuster like Starfield coming up, there’s a serious chance Baldur’s Gate 3 could be in play for GOTY, and I imagine many individual outlets or creators may end up picking it in the end.</p>

<p>I think what’s the most shocking to me is the <em>kind</em> of game this is, a very enormous, detailed, turn-based RPG that simply doesn’t get made anymore. But while it may have fallen out of fashion with publishers and developers, that simply is not true for the general public, who raced to Baldur’s Gate 3 despite it being 20 years since the last one. Just wild to see. We’ll see what records it may break next.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
				<h2>From one dentist I got a quote of $460 for all of the work I needed to be done. From another, $29,850.</h2>
			</p><div>
		<p>From behind a door comes the whine of a highspeed drill. When my name is called, I am ushered into an examining room and welcomed with a nutcracker handshake by the dentist, a graying at the temples man.</p>
<p>Soon I am staring toward the white cork ceiling while my teeth are probed, poked, tapped, and tugged. The numbers of my teeth are called out to an assistant, who jots the information on a chart: “No. 11, crown; No. 13, MOD; No. 14, MO… ” A few minutes later comes the verdict: I need 11 crowns, plus other work. It will cost $8,347.</p>
<p>“Do this and you will have no worries about your teeth for the next 30 years, ” the dentist purrs. Somehow I doubt that. Then he adds, “You and I are going to become great friends.”</p>
<p>Somehow I doubt that too. I was there in Dayton, Ohio, as part of an assessment of the consistency and fairness of American dentistry. Since Americans spend about $42 billion a year on their teeth, it seemed like a reasonable assignment: visit 50 dentists, show them your teeth and a set of X-rays, and ask each what needs to be done.</p>
<p>Four months, 50,000 miles, and 50 exams later, I concluded that going to the dentist is nothing to smile about. Dentistry is a stunningly inexact science. Even expecting that different dentists would have different, yet valid, opinions did not prepare me for the astounding variation in diagnoses I received. Some wanted only $500 to bring me up to good dental health. Others wanted ten, 20, even 50 times that amount. Surely they could not all be right.</p>
<p>I randomly selected the dentists from the Yellow Pages in 28 states and the District of Columbia. At each of the offices, I told the same story: I was moving to the area and wanted to become a patient; I had recently come through successful gum surgery; my dental expenses were covered through a direct reimbursement program with my employer; I was interested in maintaining good oral health and was satisfied with the appearance of my teeth. Because I said I was in a direct reimbursement program, I got a written treatment plan and a cost estimate from each dentist.</p>
<p>Before embarking on my journey, I went to the Lebanon&nbsp; Pa., office of Warren Daugherty my personal dentist for the past 15 years, and a man I trust. “You look really good,” he said after examining me and my X-rays, “but I want to put a crown on No. 30. ”</p>
<p>“Roughly how much money are we talking about?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Under $500. ”</p>
<p>I asked several other dentists, who had no financial interest in my teeth, to assess their condition so that I would have a basis for comparison with what I found on the road. Joining Daugherty on my panel were Dr. John Mayes of Hershey, Pa., a fellow of the Academy of General Dentistry, who took the X rays; Dr. John Dodes of Woodhaven, N.Y., a practicing dentist and the dental expert for the National Council Against Health Fraud; and Dr. Alvin Morris of Pawley’s Island, S. C., the former dean of the University of Kentucky’s College of Dentistry and recipient of the Distinguished Service Award from the American Dental Association in 1985.</p>
<p>All agreed that my oral health was good and I had only one immediate problem, the No. 30 tooth, a molar that needed a cap or a filling. Each panelist said there was room for disagreement on tooth No. 18, but that the total should not exceed $1,500 if two crowns were recommended.</p>
<p>I began my odyssey in Madison, Wis., where my grave-faced examiner informed me that I needed five teeth crowned, including No. 30, plus additional work. The estimated cost was $3,110.</p>
<p>The next day I visited Davenport, Iowa, where the verdict was the same: five crowns. But one tooth was different from those singled out in Madison. The cost was a little lower: $2,555. Then this dentist volunteered, “Your dental work is lousy.”</p>
<p>In Moline, Il., however, I received reassuring news: “Whoever’s been working on your mouth really knows his stuff. ”</p>
<p>Dr. Pacit a Pumilia in Rockford, Il., agreed that I needed only No. 30 crowned. But in Dayton, Ohio, a dentist wanted to crown six teeth—Nos. 6 through 11 in the upper front—for cosmetic improvements. Moreover, he missed No. 30 entirely.</p>
<p>Americans’ dental health has improved dramatically since 1945, the year cavity-fighting fluoride was first added to local water supplies. Traditional dental practice—drill, fill, and bill—has fallen off dramatically. According to the National Institute of Dental Research, the number of children with cavities in their permanent teeth dropped by more than half between the early 1970s and early 1990s. Meanwhile, the population of dentists has grown by 50 percent.</p>
<p>“The decline in the incidence of cavities has led to increased competition among dentists, ” says Dr. Dodes. “Dentists, in turn, are seeking ever more ways to make money from their patients.” His role with the National Council Against Health Fraud is to help protect patients against overcharging, overtreatment, and outright quackery.</p>
<p>In Indianapolis, the practitioner said through his blue mask, “I want to take some pictures of your mouth. These are not X-rays. It’s an intra-oral camera.”</p>
<p>He placed a wandlike device in my mouth, which sent an image to the chairside television monitor and gave me a fullscreen view of my mouth in living color. He took four photographs. “These pictures are so we can show you where the problems are,” he explained. “You can take them home with you.”</p>
<p>There was no charge for the photographs. Later I learned why: the camera is considered a selling device for dentists and manufacturers claim it will pay for itself in a few months in the form of additional work. “Patients need to be sold TWICE—in the office and when they get home,” goes one bit of sales advice.</p>
<p>I was handed two estimates. One was for “necessities”: four crowns, not including No. 30, at a cost of $2,617. A separate listing for cosmetic work came to $8,665. The total: $11,282.</p>
<p>“If it’s covered, you may as well get the whole job so it’s done right,” my examiner said, lowering his voice.</p>

<p>It is an attitude I encountered a dozen times. Under the direct reimbursement program I claimed to be in, my employer would pay claims directly from an established company fund. Dentists like direct reimbursement because they get paid quickly and there is no third party, such as an insurance company, questioning their work.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, I was told: “Tell me what your insurance limits are, and we’ll proceed from there.”</p>
<p>Heading south, I hit one comforting practitioner in Marion, Ark., Dr. Henry Wah, who recommended $700 worth of work. Just a few miles away, in Memphis, Tenn., my examiner said I could squeak by with a barebones approach, “with absolutely no guarantees for the future, ” at a cost of $5,000. But what I really ought to do, he said, would be to crown all 28 teeth. (My four wisdom teeth have been extracted. ) Total cost : $13,440. He could, he assured me, do most of the job in a single day—with a 10 percent discount if I paid cash on that day.</p>
<p>In Salt Lake City, the dentist informed me solemnly, “You need a full-mouth&nbsp;reconstruction. ” Cost: $19,402. Nothing, I thought, could top this. Alas, I was wrong.</p>
<p>At a dental school, I heard about a newsletter, The Profitable Dentist, and became a subscriber. From this newsletter, I discovered that there’s a whole business devoted to telling dentists how to build up the “million dollar practice.” Dentists are flocking to courses on how to generate more profits by maximizing the use of hygienists, extending credit, stepping up collection practices, and persuading patients to accept expensive restoration work instead of fillings.</p>
<p>Not that dentists are near the poverty line. According to the American Dental Association (ADA), the average income for dentists in private practice for 1994, the last year for which figures are available, was $117,610.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, high fees and quality dentistry don’t always go hand in hand. Indeed, 15 of the 50 dentists who examined me missed my problem No. 30 entirely. And three of those dentists assured me that I had no problems whatsoever.</p>
<p>A good example of the inconsistencies I encountered was on the issue of jagged edges, also called margins. These are tiny spaces between the crown and the tooth surface, and in my case, they were exposed as a result of gum surgery.</p>
<p>Above downtown Seattle in a highrise overlooking Puget Sound, the dentist had a 15-minute look in my mouth, and when done he was somber. “Some of your crowns have jagged edges and need immediate attention. They will trap food and cause decay.” He wanted to do 17 crowns—though he missed No. 30—and other work at a cost of $13,774.</p>
<p>A few weeks after the urgency in Seattle, I was in Cambridge, Mass. “The downside of gum surgery is that you have a lot of exposed roots,” the dentist said. “It’s not necessary to change all the crowns if you keep them clean and practice a good daily routine.” She recommended one crown and four fillings at a cost of $1,220. In Washington, D. C., the margins were a $5,275 problem. They were not a problem in Cody, Wyo., and Lahaina, Hawaii. They were a problem in Albuquerque and Omaha.</p>
<p>The panelists? None of them thought the margins posed an immediate threat to my dental health.</p>
<p>There were signs of consistency and fairness in American dentistry. In a humble office in Burlington, Vt., I was checked thoroughly by Dr. David Blanck. The exam included an oral cancer and periodontal screening and a request to consult with my home periodontist. (My panel says all three should be part of a proper new patient exam.) He was among a dozen practitioners whose treatment plans were substantially the recommendations of my panel.</p>
<p>However, only nine of the 50 wanted to consult with the periodontist who performed my gum surgery; only 21 conducted the ADA recommended oral cancer screening, and only 14 did the ADA recommended periodontal screening. The cost of my exams ranged from $20 to $141, and the cost of a porcelain crown ranged from $329 to $1,150.</p>
<p>My final stop was on Park Avenue in New York City, a stone’s throw from Grand Central Terminal. A revolving door chopped rush hour crowds into people. Smooth as mercury, an elevator whisked me up the highrise, where I entered an impressive office—handsome furniture, art on the walls, oriental carpets on hardwood floors. Baroque music wafted from invisible speakers. The dentist was a trim, athletic man, and as he examined my teeth, he shook his head in displeasure. Finally, he sighed and invited me to a private conference room.</p>
<p>“The news is not good, and you’re lucky you have insurance,” he said. He handed me a treatment plan that said I needed 21 crowns and veneer on six lower front teeth.</p>
<p>It would cost $29,850.</p>
<p>I decided to get one extra exam. This one wouldn’t be from a dentist in private practice but from a dental school student whose principal impetus would be to get it right rather than to get rich. A week later I was sitting in the clinic of the Creighton University School of Dentistry in Omaha. My examiner was Larry Tran, a 25-year-old Californian in his third year of the four-year program. He did the oral cancer exam, the periodontal screening, and checked my bite. Then he proceeded, slowly, painstakingly. After about 30 minutes, he said: “You’re in good shape. You need a crown on No. 30, and I’d like to crown No. 18. The cost will be $460. Now I need to find my instructor. ”</p>
<p>A minute later he was back with Dr. John Thurmond, the chairman of oral diagnosis and radiology, who also examined me. “You got it right,” he said to Tran.</p>
<p>I asked the American Dental Association how the dentists I saw could draw such different conclusions from the same set of facts. They put me in touch with Dr. Leslie Seldin, a New York dentist and a consumer adviser for the ADA. He said he was not surprised by the inconsistencies. “Dentistry is an art based on scientific knowledge, and what’s most important to all of us is that we each use our professional judgment to design what we believe is the best solution for the patient.” But Dr. Morris, the former dean, said my findings are “disturbing” and notes that guidelines are needed to assist dentists in providing quality care. “Some doctors say we don’t need standards in dentistry because they already exist for who gets into dental school, who graduates, and who is admitted to practice. The problem with most measures, however, is they inevitably reach a minimally acceptable level, requiring not that one be good but that one not be bad. ”</p>
<p>The ADA recently developed a set of nonbinding treatment parameters. My panel’s Dr. Dodes calls them “mostly nebulous generalities that do little to guarantee patients adequate treatment.”</p>
<p>What, then, can Americans do to protect themselves from overtreatment and overcharging? Says the ADA’s Dr. Seldin, “We encourage patients to seek out—certainly if there’s a lot of work to be done—second or third opinions so they can have comfort with the practitioner’s recommendations.”</p>
<p>I got 50 opinions, and I am not comforted.</p>

<p>In the early 2010s, the economist Justin Lin Yifu, a former World Bank chief official with ties to the Chinese government, <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/growth-and-the-chinese-economy-s-latecomer-advantage-by-justin-yifu-lin-2013-08">predicted</a> that China’s economy would have at least two more decades of growth above 8%. He reckoned that since the country’s per capita income at that time was about the same level as Japan’s in the 1950s and South Korea’s and Taiwan’s in the 1970s, there was no reason China could not replicate the erstwhile successes of these other East Asian states. Lin’s optimism was echoed by the Western commentariat. The <em>Economist</em> projected that China would become the world’s biggest economy by 2018, surpassing the United States. Others fantasized that the Communist Party would embark on an ambitious programme of political liberalization. The <em>New York Times</em>’s Nicholas Kristof <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/opinion/sunday/kristof-looking-for-a-jump-start-in-china.html">wrote</a> in 2013 that Xi would ‘spearhead a resurgence of economic reform, and probably some political easing as well. Mao’s body will be hauled out of Tiananmen Square on his watch. Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning writer, will be released from prison’. The political scientist Edward Steinfeld likewise <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Playing_Our_Game.html?id=YCK-8b9CmDYC&amp;source=kp_book_description&amp;redir_esc=y">argued</a> in 2010 that China’s embrace of globalization would kickstart a process of ‘self-obsolescing authoritarianism’ resembling that of Taiwan in the 1980s and 90s. 　</p>



<p>Ten years later, the naivety of these forecasts is apparent. Even before the onset of Covid-19, the Chinese economy had slowed down and entered a domestic debt crisis, visible in the collapse of major real estate developers like Evergrande. After Beijing lifted all pandemic restrictions in late 2022, a widely anticipated economic rebound failed to materialize. Youth unemployment spiked at above 20%, surpassing that of every other G-7 nation (another estimate put it at above 45%). Data on trade, price, manufacturing and GDP growth all point to deteriorating conditions – a trend that fiscal and monetary stimulus has failed to reverse. The <em>Economist</em> now claims that China might never catch up with the US, and it is universally acknowledged that Xi is no liberal, having redoubled state intervention in the private sector and foreign enterprises while silencing dissenting voices (including those that had previously been tolerated by the Party).</p>



<p>It would be wrong to think that external factors have radically altered China’s prospects. Rather, the country’s gradual decline started more than a decade ago. Those who closely analysed the data, beyond the buzzing business districts and flashy building developments, detected this economic malaise as early as 2008. Back then, I wrote that China was entering a typical overaccumulation <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09692290701869654#:~:text=A%20full%2Dfledged%20overaccumulation%20crisis,weight%20in%20the%20global%20economy.">crisis</a>. Its booming export sector had raked in a huge amount of foreign reserves since the mid-1990s. In its closed financial system, exporters must surrender their foreign earnings to the central bank, which creates equivalent RMB to mop up the foreign currencies. This led to the rapid expansion of RMB liquidity in the economy, mostly in the form of bank loans. Because the banking system is tightly controlled by the party-state – with state-owned or state-connected enterprises serving as the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/columbia-scholarship-online/book/18891/chapter-abstract/177209413?redirectedFrom=fulltext">fiefdoms</a> and cash cows of elite families – the state sector enjoyed privileged access to state bank loans, which were used to fuel an investment spree. The result was rising employment, a temporary and localized economic boom, and a windfall for the elite. But this dynamic also left behind redundant and unprofitable construction projects: empty apartments, underused airports, excessive coal plants and steel mills. That, in turn, resulted in falling profits, slowing growth and worsening indebtedness across the main sectors of the economy.</p>



<p>Throughout the 2010s, the party-state periodically undertook new lending in an attempt to arrest the slowdown. But many enterprises simply took advantage of easy bank loans to refinance their existing debt without adding new spending or investment to the economy. These companies eventually became loan addicts; and as with any addiction, increasing doses were needed to generate diminishing effects. Over time, the economy lost its dynamism as zombie enterprises were kept alive through debt alone: a classic case of the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-29/inventor-of-balance-sheet-recession-says-china-is-now-in-one">‘balance-sheet recession’</a> that roiled Japan after its boom ended in the early 1990s. Yet just as these woes became increasingly clear to insiders in the early 2010s, they were censored in official media, which amplified Lin’s upbeat assessment. Meanwhile in the Western world, a web of Wall Street bankers and corporate executives had reason to suppress more sceptical analyses, as they continued to profit off luring investors into China. The illusion of limitless high-speed growth thus ruled the day at the very moment when the economy entered its most serious crisis since the outset of the market reform era.</p>



<p>Beijing has long known what must be done to alleviate this crisis. An obvious step would be to initiate redistributive reform to boost household income and hence household consumption – which, as a share of GDP, has been among the lowest in the world. Since the late 90s, there have been calls to rebalance the Chinese economy in favour of a more sustainable growth model, by reducing its reliance on exports and fixed asset investment like infrastructure construction. This led to some reformist, redistributive policies under the Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao government of 2003–13, such as the New Labour Contract Law, the abolition of agriculture tax, and the redirection of government investment to inland rural regions. But the weight of vested interests (state enterprises, as well as local governments thriving on construction contracts and state bank loans fuelling those projects), and the powerlessness of social groups who stand to benefit from such rebalancing policy (workers, peasants and middle-class households), meant that reformism did not take root. The minimal gains in inequality reduction in the Hu–Wen period were duly reversed after the mid-2010s. More recently, Xi has made <a href="https://jacobin.com/2023/02/mussolini-in-beijing">clear</a> that his ‘common prosperity programme’ is not a return to the egalitarianism of the Mao era, nor even a restoration of welfarism. It is, rather, an assertion of the state’s paternalistic role vis-à-vis capital: increasing its presence in the tech and real estate sectors, and aligning private entrepreneurship with the broader interests of the nation.</p>



<p>The party-state has been bracing itself for the social and political repercussions of this dire situation. In official policy speeches, ‘security’ has become the most frequently uttered word, eclipsing ‘economy’. The current leadership believes that it can survive an economic downturn by tightening its control over society, eradicating autonomous elite factions, and adopting a more assertive posture on the international stage amid rising geopolitical tension – even if such measures serve to aggravate its developmental problems. This helps to explain the abolition of the presidential term limits in 2018, the centralization of power within Xi’s hands, the relentless campaign to root out Party factions in the name of anti-corruption, the construction of a growing surveillance state, and the shifting basis of state legitimation: away from the delivery of economic growth and towards nationalist fervour. The current weakening of the economy and hardening of authoritarianism are not easily reversible trends. They are, in fact, the logical outcome of China’s uneven development and capital accumulation over the last four decades. This means they are here to stay.</p>

      Sandra Shuster, from Denver, took matters into her own hands when her lost bag was showing as being at Chicago O’Hare airport – but her airline, United, was doing nothing about it.

      Shuster and her 15-year-old daughter Ruby, who plays lacrosse, were flying back from Baltimore via Chicago on July 17, when their checked bag went missing.
  </p>

      The pair – who’d been to Baltimore for a tournament – had traveled with carry-on bags for their clothes, but had checked one bag containing Ruby’s lacrosse kit. When they arrived at Denver after midnight, the bag wasn’t on the belt. United representatives at Denver gave them a case number and told them the bag should arrive on the 8.30 a.m. flight from Chicago in just a few hours. When it didn’t, Shuster called the toll-free number for lost baggage that she’d been given.

      “They said, ‘Your bag’s going to come in later today on one of two flights.’ I said ‘OK, great,’ but it never came. So I called later that afternoon and they said ‘Your bag is still in Baltimore,’” says Shuster.

      There was just one problem: she already knew it wasn’t in Baltimore. Three months earlier, Shuster had bought an AirTag – Apple’s tracking devices – to know where her daughter’s bag was. “This is unique equipment, and we have to check it. Airlines are getting worse, rates of lost luggage are getting higher, and I wanted to know where it was – so I bought the tag,” she explains.

      “I told them I could see it at Terminal 1 baggage reclaim in Chicago, and they said ‘We have no record of it.’ I asked them to call Chicago, and they said ‘No, we’re not allowed.’ They said they’d put notes in the system and the baggage team would take care of it.”

      When the bag still didn’t arrive, and Shuster called a third time, she was told “We have no idea where it is.”

      They also told Shuster that she had the wrong claim number – impossible, she thought, because she still had the sticker that had been attached to her boarding pass. The other half was on the bag.

      In fact, they were right – sort of. The claim number was indeed the same as the tag that had been attached to her bag – but the check-in agent had attached the wrong tag. This one was for another passenger, who was traveling from Baltimore to Chicago only. That meant the bag had been taken off the plane at O’Hare and sent straight to the reclaim belt, instead of being loaded onto the Denver flight.

      Ruby plays goal in lacrosse, which meant there was kit totaling about $2,000 in that bag. Replacing it wasn’t just about the finances, says Shuster – a new stick needs to be restrung and then broken in, needing about a month in total. Meanwhile they were flying to San Francisco for another tournament in two days’ time. Ruby borrowed some kit for that trip.

      Returning from California, they stopped at the lost luggage desk in Denver with their reference number, and reiterated that the AirTag was still tracking at Chicago.

      After suggesting someone had stolen the bag and dumped the AirTag, she says, the United representative told her that most people immediately put in claims to replace items, get $1,000-2,000 in compensation, and then have their bag arrive in a few weeks.
  </p>

      But Shuster was convinced it was still there. “It had moved maybe 50 feet, and the AirTag was embedded in the bag – I doubted someone stole it,” she says. “He was implying it could be a double win but I wasn’t trying to game the system – to replace what was in that bag was much harder.”
  </p>

      So when she asked a Chicago friend if there was any way he could swing by the airport, and realized he was on vacation himself, Shuster took matters into her own hands and booked a flight with air miles.

      By this time, she’d made contact with United’s Twitter team, but been told they couldn’t locate it.

      They suggested she call United. As a frequent flyer, she called the priority line – and was told to submit an online claim. Three days on, she’d heard nothing – but less than 24 hours after CNN contacted United, the airline deposited her 30,000 miles back in her account (though not the taxes that she’d spent), along with an apology “for the inconvenience you experienced on your recent trip with United.”

      United said in a statement: “Unfortunately, this bag was incorrectly tagged at the start of the trip which contributed to the longer delay – we’ve apologized to Ms. Shuster, reimbursed the miles used and gave her an additional travel credit to use toward a future flight. Our teams work to reconnect our customers with their baggage as quickly as possible and we regret that we could not get this bag to Denver sooner.”

      So what lessons have been learned? Shuster says she’ll always check the claim ticket that’s placed on her bag, instead of assuming that check-in staff have got it right. She’ll also watch it down the conveyor belt.

<p>Welcome to Jupyter AI, which brings generative AI to Jupyter. Jupyter AI provides a user-friendly
and powerful way to explore generative AI models in notebooks and improve your productivity
in JupyterLab and the Jupyter Notebook. More specifically, Jupyter AI offers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An <code><span>%%ai</span></code> magic that turns the Jupyter notebook into a reproducible generative AI playground.
This works anywhere the IPython kernel runs (JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, VSCode, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p>A native chat UI in JupyterLab that enables you to work with generative AI as a conversational assistant.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for a wide range of generative model providers and models
(AI21, Anthropic, Cohere, Hugging Face, OpenAI, SageMaker, etc.).</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="jupyterlab-support">
<h2>JupyterLab support<a href="#jupyterlab-support" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>Each major version of Jupyter AI supports <em>only one</em> major version of JupyterLab.</strong> Jupyter AI 1.x supports
JupyterLab 3.x, and Jupyter AI 2.x supports JupyterLab 4.x. The feature sets of versions 1.0.0 and 2.0.0
are the same. We will maintain support for JupyterLab 3 for as long as it remains maintained.</p>
<p>The <code><span>main</span></code> branch of Jupyter AI targets the newest supported major version of JupyterLab. All new features and most bug fixes will be
committed to this branch. Features and bug fixes will be backported
to work on JupyterLab 3 only if developers determine that they will add sufficient value.
<strong>We recommend that JupyterLab users who want the most advanced Jupyter AI functionality upgrade to JupyterLab 4.</strong></p>

<p>A few weeks ago I had the questionable pleasure of diving into the math exception handler of WIN87EM.DLL, the Windows 3.1 math emulator and FPU support library. Actually WIN87EM.DLL appears to have been first shipped with Windows 3.0, and the version in Windows 3.1 is more or less identical. The version shipped with Windows 3.11 is byte for byte identical to the one in Windows 3.1.</p>



<p>The main function of WIN87EM.DLL is, as the name suggests, an x87 floating-point emulator. It appears to be an outgrowth of the math emulation packages shipped with many Microsoft languages. But even on a system with x87 hardware, WIN87EM.DLL has some work to do.</p>



<p>Namely WIN87EM.DLL intercepts math errors (exceptions). Depending on the system type, WIN87EM.DLL hooks either NMI vector 2 (PC and PC/XT) or IRQ 13 (PC/AT and compatibles).</p>



<p>The math interrupt handler in WIN87EM.DLL is very, <em>very</em> strange. It bears all the hallmarks of code that was written, rewritten, rewritten again, hacked, tweaked, modified, and eventually beaten into submission even if the author(s) had no real idea <em>why</em> it finally worked.</p>



<p>Now, x87 math error handing is a very tricky subject where numerous details changed over FPU and CPU generations, and Intel had a fair share of bugs in this area. But the code in WIN87EM.DLL looks very much like the result of changes made in desperation until it worked <em>somehow</em>, even though the changes made little or no sense.</p>



<h3>What WIN87EM.DLL Does</h3>



<p>The IRQ 13 handler in WIN87EM.DLL performs the following steps:</p>



<ul>
<li>Disable interrupts (CLI)</li>



<li>PUSH and POP the AX register 70 times, maybe it will slow things down</li>



<li>Write zero to I/O port F0h to clear the PC/AT FPU error latch</li>



<li>Mask a selection of interrupts</li>



<li>Write an EOI to the master interrupt controller (but not slave)</li>



<li>Execute the FNSTSW instruction to store the FPU status word (but only that)</li>



<li>PUSH and POP the AX register 16 times, because speed kills</li>



<li>Write zero to I/O port F0h again, in case it didn’t work the first time</li>



<li>Execute the FNCLEX instruction to clear pending FPU exceptions</li>



<li>Write zero to I/O port F0h again, because third time’s the charm</li>



<li>PUSH and POP the AX register 16 times, because it was so much fun last time</li>



<li>Execute the FNCLEX instruction again, just to be really sure</li>



<li>PUSH and POP the AX register 16 times, because it’s the thing to do</li>



<li>Write zero to I/O port F0h again, because three times might not have been enough</li>



<li>Finally jump to code that doesn’t look crazy</li>
</ul>



<p>The not so crazy looking code executes FNSTENV to store the FPU environment, swaps in the previously saved status word (which was subsequently changed by FNCLEX), examines the code at the stored FPU error pointer to see if instruction prefixes should be skipped (that is where things may crash), enables interrupts with STI, and finally jumps to common code that’s executed on both PCs and ATs and handles the actual math error.</p>



<p>All in all, the math error interrupt handler in WIN87EM.DLL makes very little sense. I am extremely doubtful that, for example, writing to I/O port F0h four times does anything useful, or that executing FNCLEX twice is better than doing it once. However, it is entirely possible that the extra time it takes might do something. Likewise the slowdown loops that push and pop AX are very unlikely to be necessary, but may have done something seemingly useful on some particular system.</p>



<p>The code really does look like a desperate attempt to make things work, and there is some possibility that it is the result of trying to support broken hardware. Other similar error handlers I looked at don’t appear nearly as convoluted and are much more “by the book”.</p>



<p>We’ll probably never know why the code ended up so crazy, but we can speculate.</p>

<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Hi, this is CoRecursive, and I’m Adam Gordon Bell. Each episode is the story of a piece of software being built.</p>
<p>Have you ever had a unique approach to a problem and been excited to use it, but you meet with skepticism. That’s today’s story. What happens if you take someone who’s passionate about a certain approach and put them in an organization where that’s just not the way things are done? Today is the story of getting LISP into space.</p>
<p>You know LISP, right? The language with all the parentheses and the macros and the treating code as data. Well, my guest today is a big fan, Ron Garrett. At the time this story starts, he’s wrapping up his PhD in robotics and AI. And the AI that we’re talking about here is not machine learning, it’s AI meaning autonomy, like autonomous robots for self-driving cars. We’re going back in time.</p>

<p>The year is 1988. The USSR still existed. Ronald Reagan was president of the United States and Ron under his thesis advisor was working on a prototype for a very iconic NASA project.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
My name is Ron Garrett.</p>
<p>Our goal was to develop the software that would allow NASA to send an autonomous rover to Mars. The challenge with operating on Mars, well, there are lots of challenges to operate on Mars, but one of them is that there’s a 40 minute round trip light time delay. And so you can’t just remotely operate a rover. The time lag is much, much, much, much too long. So it needs a certain level of autonomy because there’s going to be 40 minutes between when you tell it to do something and when you find out what it actually did as a result of what you told it. And so your productivity is going to improve the more that the rover can get done on each one of those cycles. So we were trying to push the level of autonomy so that it could go further on a single command cycle. And that was the goal.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
This all happened at the Jet Propulsion Lab, the JPL in Los Angeles, where Ron had a fairly standard cubicle.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
But around the corner, there was an electronic shop where I would sometimes go when we needed to build some hardware, which back in those days we often did have to build our own custom hardware. And a lot of the robots that we built were indoor robots and we just ran them around the office. But every now and then, we would go outside into, there’s a dry river bed called the Arroyo Seco, which literally means dry riverbed that is adjacent to the lab. And on occasion, we would go out there to run robots outdoors because the environment there is actually very similar to the environment that you get on Mars. And on a couple of occasions, we would actually go out to Death Valley and do experiments out there. And that was a lot of fun.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
How big are these robots?</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
So the smallest one was about the size of a shoebox, I guess. I should actually start out by telling you about a medium size one that we had, which was about the size of maybe half of a standard refrigerator, big and heavy. And if it ever ran into something, it could do some serious damage. And so we called it FANG, which was an acronym for Futuristic Autonomous Navigation Gizmo. And so the little shoebox sized one, we called Tooth.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Oh, I see.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
And then there were a couple of outdoor robots. The first one was this giant six wheeled behemoth that used truck tires. It was the size of an SUV and it called Robbie. And then there were a series of smaller rovers, which eventually turned into the first actual Mars rovers, the Sojourner rover. So a series of prototypes for that rover called Rocky, the Rocky series. So there was Rocky 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Sojourner would be the first Mars rover. And we know now it would like land on Mars in 1997 and be considered a great success. But nine years before then in 1988, rovers were just a research project. They were exploring what was possible and Ron’s team’s approach and their choice of programming languages, which was the LISP, it came right out of the academic research they were doing. One potential problem though is that using LISP really wasn’t how software was built at NASA.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
There was quite a bit of prejudice against LISP because it was weird and unfamiliar, and it had this strange garbage collection technology that you just never knew when it would just stop your process dead in its tracks. And that can be catastrophic when you’re dealing in an embedded environment where you have to respond in real-time. And also people thought that LISP was very memory hungry. But back in those days when eight megabytes of RAM was considered a huge amount of RAM. And there were people saying like, yo, you’re sure your research machines have eight megabytes, but you’ll never fly machines that big. Of course, nowadays a hundred mega megabytes is normal. And of course, this is all foreseeable because space qualified hardware follows Moore’s law. Just like everything else, it just lags behind a couple of years. So I found all this to be very frustrating.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
I get this. I’ve been this person before who thinks he has a great way to solve a problem, but hits a lot of barriers with getting people to adopt it. But Ron is talking about running LISP on embedded robots. And to do that, I think you really need a trick.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
On the larger robots that had a few megabytes of RAM, we actually ran LISP on the robot. So the actual code that controlled the robot was written in LISP. Now, the other way which LISP was used for the little robots was designing languages specifically for programming robots and compiling those languages down to embedded code that would run on small processors.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
As an outsider, this seems like a really cool approach. You could get down in the weeds of the robot hardware and try to write autonomous code at that level. But instead, Ron is raising the abstraction. He’s writing a custom language that can best specify the problem and then compiling that down to the actual hardware. It’s a neat trick where every problem becomes a compiler problem. It sounds like it will be a lot of work in most programming languages, but Ron’s using LISP, which he’s been doing since the mid eighties.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
So you have to keep in mind that there is no Java, there is no Python, there is no JavaScript, there is no C++. There is Pascal and C and basic and machine code, and that’s pretty much it in terms of popular languages. And to get anything done in any of those languages is just really, really hard. And this by contrast gives you all of this high level abstraction that you can just use without having to worry about it. And so you don’t have to worry about memory management, you don’t have to worry about dangling pointers. It’s just so much faster and easier to get things done when the language you’re using provides you with some of these high level abstractions. And in a world where the only language that has that is LISP, knowing LISP really is like a superpower. It just blew everything else out of the water back in those days.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
So Ron was a true believer, but he was also a talented developer and the stakes were high because NASA has a rival team also working on Mars rover prototypes. Ron’s team has to get Robbie and FANG self-driving if they want a chance at their approach being used on the real rover.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
And so we had this development environment where we would develop the code off board on Macintoshes in an environment that had a simulator for the robot, and we get things mostly working and then we’d run the same code on the robot to see if it worked on the real robot. And the reason for that was that running experiments on the real robot, especially on Robbie, was very expensive in terms of time. To all be carefully planned, we had to load Robbie onto a flatbed truck and drive him out into the Arroyo and unload him and get everything set up and all the support equipment. And it took a couple of hours to get set up and then we’d be out there for most of the day running experiments and then we had to pack everything up and put him away again at the end of the day.</p>
<p>So that was a big deal. And so running the code in simulation helped us make more effective use of that time.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Ron’s group and the work they did was groundbreaking in many ways.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
The goal was to get these rovers to move around in natural environments completely autonomously. So you would tell it, I want to go over there. So Robbie had a pair of stereo cameras. He was actually the first robot in the world to navigate using stereo vision. So in a way, Robbie was the precursor to a lot of the autonomous cars that we have nowadays. They don’t use stereo vision, they mostly use LIDAR, but some of them do use vision processing in order to do obstacle avoidance. So Robbie was the first robot to do this. And then there was the actual navigation code, which took 3D stereo data and the goal location and planned a path and executed it. And that was what I worked on.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
So you’d take it out to wherever and put some location and then you kind of see what happens and…</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
Right, exactly. And you have to keep in mind that Robbie moved very slowly. So yeah, he’s big and heavy, but he’s moving it less than one mile an hour.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
So he’s not really that dangerous. If he starts to do something wrong, there’s plenty of time to push the panic button, but you do have to be watching him constantly because he’s a big, expensive one off piece of research equipment and he is very easily capable of driving up onto a rock that would tip him over and that would probably destroy him if he fell over. It never happened, thankfully. But yeah, we had to be watching him all the time, but you didn’t have to worry about him going rogue and killing somebody.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Developing real-time software for robots in the 1980s, that can be a frustrating endeavor.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
It was cutting edge research code, so it was buggy and it crashed and things went wrong. We never had any catastrophes, thankfully. I think FANG once went rogue and put a hole in the drywall in the office. But that was the worst because FANG w as easily capable of moving fast enough to do some damage. So thankfully, he never hurt anybody.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Robbie, Rocky, Tooth and FANG, they were some of the most capable self-driving robots at the time. A lot of self navigation first happened on this team. But while Ron was heads down working on the code, things with the team started to go sideways.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
And telling this story would be a little touchy because it was to some extent political. I was young and naive and had my head down in the code and I was vaguely aware that there was all these political battles being fought, but I didn’t really know the details and I didn’t understand how political battles are fought. I’ve learned a lot about that since then, but at the time I was pretty oblivious.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
You see, there was a turf war between Ron’s researchy robotics group which was trying to push autonomy and that other group.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
So their approach was not to just give it a goal and have the rover figure out how to get there, but to have an operator describe an exact path for the rover to follow, which it would then do. They have some level of autonomy, but there is an operator who’s sitting at a console where he has a 3D view of the terrain and describing exact path for the rover to follow on each cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Building a Mars rover prototype of any kind is, I’m sure, super challenging, but this other team’s approach where they’re describing an exact path, it’s a smaller problem than marking a destination and having the robot navigate to that goal, which is good, but also when it was deployed, there would be some challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
You don’t know whether you’ve succeeded for the better part of an hour after you’ve sent it to command. So you’re sitting there bitting your fingernails hoping that you didn’t screw something up.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
The operational burden of this approach is really high, whereas a totally self-driving approach has a much lower operations cost. In fact, if the robots could be self driven, potentially more and smaller robots could be sent. I mean, they would have to be very reliable, but each small robot could head out exploring on its own and then more could be done with less. But there is a political problem.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
There’s decades of operational experience that into the current ways of doing things. And it’s very labor intensive and developing a technology whose goal is to put these people out of work doesn’t immediately endear you to the people whose livelihoods depend on doing this work. There’s this whole infrastructure of people whose livelihood depends on this technology not existing.</p>
<h2 id="sojourner-on-mars"><strong>Sojourner on Mars</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
So don’t lose hope because the story continues. This LISP code is going into space, but it did not make it into the first Mars rover, Sojourner. The low autonomy operator driven solution won the day, but that might not be a bad thing.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
Even today, I’m not entirely convinced that NASA made the wrong decision. And I base that just on what they’ve actually managed to accomplish. I look at the pictures that come back from these rovers and the science that comes back from these rovers, and it just boggles my mind and blows me away. It impresses me so much that I can barely find the words. Here I am sitting at my desk in my home, looking at photographs, high resolution, color photographs from another planet. That’s just such a spectacular thing to be alive at a time in human history when that is possible.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Do you feel like it makes it real, like seeing these pictures? Does it seem more like a real place?</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
Oh yeah. The photos coming back today are just incredibly high quality and give you a real sense of the place. And one of the things that I find most striking is how similar it is to places on earth and in particular, how similar it is to the places in Death Valley, where we ran some of these early tests. And in particular, it can really, at least gives me a sense of what it would like to actually be there and walking around the there, and all this has me very convinced that I never want to go there. I’ve spent time in Death Valley and these places that are just like there except much more benign because you don’t actually have to be wearing a space suit to survive. I can tell you from semi firsthand experience that colonizing Mars is a pipe dream.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Really?</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
Yeah. We really need to take care of this planet that we have because no matter how bad things get here, it’s still going to be better here. It’s still going to be easier to terraform earth and to terraform Mars.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
So Sojourner was a success, just without the LISP. The code it shipped with was written in C and the autonomy was very restricted. Ron’s group disbanded and many of them left the JPL, though not Ron. And a couple years later, it seemed like there was a new opportunity.</p>

<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
There were some people who thought that maybe some of this autonomy technology could be used for actual spacecraft, flying in space, and that some of the theories of economies of scale could be applied there. And in particular, NASA got a new director around that time. He was an advocate of this idea of trying to pursue economies of scale in order to reduce mission costs. And he launched a pilot program called the New Millennium series. It was a series of missions, technology demonstration missions with the explicit goal of trying to demonstrate technologies that could be deployed at scale in order to reduce operating costs. And the autonomy technology that we had started developing for rovers was repurposed for that in a project called the Remote Agent that was done in collaboration with the Ames Research Center and some work that people were doing there in planners and diagnostic systems.</p>
<p>There were three or four, depending on how you count, major components of this thing that were developed at JPL and Ames. And one of them came from Carnegie Mellon that were all kind of all together to make the Remote Agent.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
It was called the Remote Agent because it was going to have agency. Just like the rover prototypes, it would have a goal and take actions to accomplish that goal. But this time it was a flight controller and not a rover controller.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
So the New Millennium emissions were divided into two categories. There were the deep space missions which went out of earth orbits and the EO missions that were in earth orbit. And we were slated to fly on the first deep space mission, DS1, Deep Space 1, which was going to go to rendezvous with a comet and an asteroid. And they had a whole bunch of other cutting edge technologies that were going to fly on the same mission and get demonstrated in the same mission. And originally we were slated to control the entire mission with the Remote Agent.</p>
<h2 id="project-management-problems"><strong>Project Management Problems</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
But unfortunately problems occurred before things got that far.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
And this, again, is where it gets a little bit a touchy. And I have to be very careful here because I really don’t want to offend anybody who was on the team because everybody on the team was really good and really smart and worked incredibly hard. And the problems were more managerial than technical. So we were four different teams from three different institutions that had all been brought together to build the system and nobody was really in charge of designing and integrating the final system. It was just allowed to kind of happen organically. And so there was a lot of negotiating and cajoling and frankly infighting and arguing. And on the technological side, in particular, there was one component that the three of the four components were written in LISP and one of the four or components was written in C. And the component that was written in C early on kept crashing because when you write in C, you have to worry about all these low level details and this is just a thing that happens when you write in C.</p>
<p>And they eventually got that all worked out, but while things were crashing, that slowed down development because you’d be running an experiment and suddenly it would crash and you had to reboot and reload everything and that cost you 10 minutes and multiply that by a couple of dozen times a day and you’re running behind schedule.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
So then I assume everybody learned that you shouldn’t use C.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
Well, you would think that would be the lesson that they would learn, but no, that lesson was not learned. Nowadays, the flight control software, I believe, is written in C and they have to code it very carefully and use a lot of testing and analysis tools in order to get it to work. And they have managed to make it work and they’ve managed to make it reliable, but it’s a tremendous amount of effort. And unfortunately at the time, I was not very skilled at playing politics and so I was a little bit more blunt about this than I should have been. I ended up off a lot of people and I think that had probably as much to do with the ultimate failure of the project as anything else because all these old timers who knew how to run spacecraft just didn’t like me and didn’t want to have this obnoxious brat around.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Sure. Ron’s certainty probably ruffled some feathers at the JPL, but it was the time to get these four systems integrated that actually caused the most delays and got this autonomous system downgraded to a flight experiment. Instead of controlling Deep Space 1 for the whole trip, it would control it for just three days. But still three days of controlling a spacecraft is no simple matter. And so the various teams worked hard to make sure the software was as solid as it could be.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Ron’s portion was called the executive.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
So it was the software that decided, okay, this is what we’re going to do next in response to the input data and the possibility of various contingencies. It was the thing that decided what the spacecraft was going to do moment to moment. And it was programmed using another one of these custom languages that was written in LISP. And funnily enough, I can’t remember the name of the language now, which is really weird because that was like my baby. Why can’t I not remember its name? And this language was designed in such a way that at like LISP, the structure of language would prevent you from writing code that had certain kinds of issues. And the biggest issue that it was designed to prevent was the kinds of problems that you get when you have multi-threaded code, in other words, code that does more than one thing at the same time. That kind of code is notoriously difficult to manage.</p>
<p>There are all kinds of subtle problems that can arise that are sneaky and un-intuitive and can lead to problems like race conditions and deadlocks. And so this language was designed so that the very structure of the language prevented you from encountering these kinds of difficulties. And the code was even subjected to a formal analysis that we had a formal proof that the safety in variance that this language was designed to maintain were actually maintained.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Oh wow.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
So we had a formal proof and of course, we had extensive ground testing. It was tested for days and days and days in simulation. And when I say simulation, this was running on a copy of the flight hardware and the only thing that was being simulated was that we weren’t actually in space, but all of the hardware was the same hardware or copy of the hardware that was actually going to fly. And so we had a formal proof of correctness and we had extensive ground testing with no problems.</p>
<p>So we were very confident that it was going to work and it didn’t work.</p>

<p>This was like the second day of the three day experiment. So people were sleeping during this time, but not very much. And my memory of the details here are fairly fuzzy, but it was an all hands on deck situation because the scenario had been designed with safeguards in place so that the odds of actually losing the spacecraft were very low, even if the Remote Agents screwed up.</p>
<p>But the fact that it screwed up was still orange alert, if not red alert.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
It stopped making decisions or it just freezes?</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
There was a time at which it was supposed to do something and that time came and went and it didn’t do the thing it was supposed to do. And alarm bells rang and-</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Where was this?</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
It was out in space. It was 150 million miles away. It was an hour round trip lifetime.</p>
<h2 id="debugging-code-in-space"><strong>Debugging Code in Space</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Whoa. So now it’s time to debug a production incident, but this isn’t code running on a server in the cloud, this code is one light hour round trip time away. This is code running in deep space and to fix the problem, there’s Ron who wrote the programming language, and then there’s this guy that he hired to help him do the spacecraft code.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
So I hired the guy in part so that I could push the coding responsibilities off onto him and kind of back away from the process because I could tell that I wasn’t really being very effective. And I was young and foolish and a very, very bad manager at that point. And I did not do a very good job of handing this task off to him. I basically just said, here’s what needs to be done. Go do it.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
And he did do it. He got things built, but now this code that’s been proven deadlock free seems to be frozen 150 million miles from home. And so it’s time for Ron to jump back in and take control.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
This guy was frustrated with me. He’d really been in the trenches for months doing my dirty work for me. That was all hands on deck and so I was swooping back in as a white knight to try and fix the situation again the way I had so skillfully done so many times before. The guy told me to go F myself, which came as a surprise to me because I didn’t realize that things had reached that level of tension. And so I think in retrospect, his reaction was very understandable, but at the time it took me completely by surprise.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Emotions are running high and it’s time to debug this issue. The more time passes, the more off target Deep Space 1 is.</p>
<h2 id="sending-s-expressions"><strong>Sending S-Expressions</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
We had no idea what was going on. All we knew was that this telemetry that it was supposed to send back hadn’t been received and now we had to decide how to proceed. And everything that we did when we decided to do something, we would do it and then we would sit around and wait an hour for the result.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
So by the time you knew that it didn’t make that turn, that was already an hour ago.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
Well, it was a half an hour ago because it’s a half hour out and a half hour back. Things get really weird on how you reckon these things, right? So yeah, effectively, it was an hour ago.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
How does this work? How do you communicate with it?</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
That’s a good question. So you’re familiar with Python, right?</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
I am. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
So when you’re programming a Python, you have a REPL, a read–eval–print loop. So you can program Python interactively in addition to just putting code in a file and running it like a regular program. Well, LISP pioneered that. So in this, the normal way of interacting with LISP was through a REPL and this was the first language to have that feature. And it was the only language to have that feature for decades. And that’s one of the reasons why it was such a big lever back in the early days, but this was REPL so we had a REPL running on the spacecraft and we could interact with the spacecraft through that REPL. Now accessing that REPL was not just a matter of sitting down at a terminal typing at it because to communicate with that REPL, you had to go through the Deep Space network and deal with this hour long round trip light time.</p>
<p>So what the process actually looked like is we’d sit around in a conference room and scratch our heads and argue and try to decide what commands to send it, and finally come to a consensus on what batch of commands that we should send. And those then went through a review process that consisted of a number of layers of management, all of whom had to sign off on it. And once they signed off, it was handed off to an actual operator who was trained in interacting with the Deep Space network. And they would sit down at the console that was connected to the Deep Space network and they would type in these commands and then push the big red button to send those commands up to the spacecraft. So it goes from the console in a building at JPL through a dedicated hardwired network to one of the Deep Space network antennas. And there are three of these around the world so that you have coverage of the entire sky.</p>
<p>And these are huge 70 meter antennas, just enormous pieces of infrastructure. And I don’t actually know the details of what happens at the station. I don’t know whether there’s another human in the loop at that point or whether it’s all automated, but eventually the signal goes out of this huge 70 meter antenna and goes flying through space at the speed of light where it’s received by the antenna on the spacecraft and goes through this very elaborate system on the spacecraft where the signal is decoded and turned into bits. And eventually those bits get fed into the LISP system in exactly the same as it would’ve been if you’d been sitting there physically with the terminal typing at it. And it was a very elaborate and formal process that involved people wearing these headsets that you see like in the movies, going through this very formal process, that we are now going to send this command to the spacecraft and somebody else saying, yes, you are go to send the command to the spacecraft.</p>
<p>And then finally the guy who was sitting at the console would push the big red button and then we’d sit around and wait for the results. And then we’d look at the results and do the whole thing over again.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
That’s crazy. You’re sending like a big tree of a LISP expression or what…</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
Yeah. We were sending up S-Expressions.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
What do you tell it? Are you telling it to reload? It’s actively running. What do you do?</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
So the first thing that we told it was send us a back trace. Send us a dump of the system state, of all the processes that are running. The processes that are waiting for something to happen, what are they waiting for? So that was the first thing we did. That information came back and we looked at it and then it was actually almost immediately obvious what was going wrong because there was this one process that was waiting for something that should have already happened. And so that was a big clue as to what was going wrong. What turned out that the problem was that there was, in fact, a race condition, which was supposed to have been impossible.</p>
<h2 id="the-proof-and-the-assumptions"><strong>The Proof and the Assumptions</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
It was proved impossible, right?</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
It was proved impossible, but the proof relied on an assumption. And the assumption was that when you were programming this thing, you were only using the constructs in the language. So the proof said, if you use the constructs in this specially design language, then you will not get deadlocks. So it’s kind of like nowadays you have rust where you have a safe part of the language and an unsafe part of the language. Well, we basically had that too, but we didn’t take that explicit. But what we hadn’t anticipated was that there was a guy who had been tasked to write some of the code-</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
This is the F off guy that Ron hired to build the software using his language.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
… and he had to make it do a particular thing and he couldn’t figure out how to make it do that using the constructs in the language so he just called a lower level construct in LISP in order to get it to work. And that did an end run around the safety guarantees of the language. And this was a failure on my part. I had not made this sufficiently clear to the guy that I hired to write this code who was working under my supervision. Basically just said, here’s what needs to be done. Go do it. And he did, but because I hadn’t impressed on him that it… In my own defense, I’ll say it was not really in the forefront of my mind that it needed to be said. I thought this guy would just figure it out. And that was obviously in retrospect an unrealistic expectation. I didn’t make it sufficiently clear that he wasn’t supposed to do this. And so he did it, not his fault, my fault, and that’s what was the cause of the bug.</p>
<h2 id="fixing-it"><strong>Fixing It</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Do you kill something or restart something or?</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
So then we had to decide whether to try to salvage this session by injecting some event to un-wedge it, which we actually did. So we actually managed to un-wedge it and have it continue through the scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
So manually issuing the event worked. Thanks to the magic of LISP and the mind blowing idea of having a live REPL on a spacecraft, the mission was saved. And also, I feel like you have to think of the odds here. This code was tested extensively and it never hit a deadlock. If you ran this mission a hundred times, it may have only deadlocked that first time and never again. Deadlocks are artifacts of timing and obviously in test scenarios, the exact timing that exposed this deadlock never happened. The odds that this failure happened are really low, but the mission only happened once and it did deadlock. So for people outside the team, it certainly doesn’t look like a success.</p>
<h2 id="the-impact-of-the-deadlock"><strong>The Impact of the Deadlock</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
We didn’t lose the spacecraft and we did accomplish all of the mission objectives. So technically it was a success, but the development process was so painful and fraught with difficulty and again, there were politics. So despite the fact that we actually did manage to get it to work, the autonomy project was canceled after that and it never flew again.</p>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
This whole process, as you can imagine, was very frustrating for Ron.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
Frustrated is understating it quite a bit. It was extremely stressful and ultimately it led to me quitting. So I got more and more marginalized in my role and it became clearer and clearer to me that fewer and fewer people wanted to work with me and there was more and more pressure to collaborate.</p>
<h2 id="enter-google"><strong>Enter Google</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
Around this time, while Ron was at a record low, he discovered this new search engine called Google.</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
I was reading a Usenet newsgroup, in fact, comp line LISP. And somebody answered some obscure technical question, which I don’t remember what the question was anymore, but they, gave this answer and then followed up saying, thank God for Google. And I was like, what the heck is Google? And so I did what one did in those days when one encountered something that was unfamiliar, was pull up my Netscape navigator and type in www.google.com. And sure enough, it was a search engine kind of like AltaVista, except that after just five minutes of noodling around with it was, it was obvious to me that this was light years ahead of anything else that existed at the time. And it was so good and so fast that my jaw was just on the floor saying, how the heck did they do that? And at the bottom of the page, there was this link saying we’re hiring. So in a fit of what Alan Greenspan would call irrational exuberance, I dashed off a resume and 15 minutes later, my phone rang.</p>
<h2 id="is-lisp-worth-it"><strong>Is LISP Worth It?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
So Ron left the JPL and started working at this tiny company called Google. But since this is CoRecursive and not the space exploration podcast, I wanted to find out now that it’s years and years later, is Ron still a LISP evangelist?</p>
<p><strong>Ron:</strong>
One of the things that I learned is that LISP has an advantage for me because it happens to be a good impedance match to my mindset. One of the reasons that it has good impedance match to my mindset is because I started using it when I was in high school. And so I’ve just been steeped in LISPness for 40 years or more. But for somebody else, it’s really weird. All those parenthesis and the weird prefix notation, that can seem very foreign and especially in common LISP, that has a lot of historical baggage and a lot of weird corner cases and potential nasty surprises. And so productivity really has a lot more to do with matching your tools to your mindset than finding the one true tool because there is not a one true tool because different people have different mindsets and different approaches and different things that they resonate with.</p>
<p>The one thing that list does give you is a better understanding of how things work at their core. And with that understanding, it becomes easier to learn other things. But in terms of actually getting things done, it has a lot more to do with how well the tool fits your particular mindset than the actual merits of the tool.</p>
<h2 id="outro"><strong>Outro</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Adam:</strong>
A big thank you to Ron Garrett for being on the show. A link to his website is in the show notes. And if you want to hear more about Ron’s time at Google during the dot-com boom, then you’re in luck. I’ve released it as a bonus episode. So if you go to the supporters link in the show notes at corecursive.com/supporters, you can access the episode right now. Will this little startup, Google, make it through the dot-com crash of the 2000s. Will Ron convince them about the beauty of LISP? You don’t have to wait to find out. It’s right now available for supporters. And until next time, thank you so much for listening.</p>

<li><strong> PAYMENTS AND CHARGES </strong></li>
<p><strong>12.1 </strong><strong>Charges</strong>. You agree that Zoom may charge your credit card, debit card, or other payment mechanism selected by you and approved by Zoom (“<strong>Payment Method</strong>”) for all amounts due and owing in connection with your use of the Services, as set forth in the applicable Order Form or otherwise used or ordered by or for you through the Services, including set up fees, one-time fees, non-recurring fees, overages, per-use charges, subscription fees, recurring fees, and any other fees and charges associated with the Services or your account (“<strong>Charges</strong>”). As provided in Section 13, unless otherwise expressly specified an Order Form, all Charges are exclusive of Taxes and Fees. You agree to promptly update your Payment Method to allow for timely payment. Changes made to your Payment Method will not affect Charges that Zoom submits to your chosen Payment Method before Zoom could reasonably act on your changes. Additionally, you agree to permit Zoom to use any updated Payment Method information provided by your issuing bank or the applicable payment network and to charge your current primary Payment Method by using the details of such Payment Method saved in our system, even if such Payment Method is declined. Zoom further reserves the right to use your backup Payment Method to the extent one is provided. By adding a backup Payment Method, you authorize Zoom to process any applicable Charges on your backup Payment Method if your primary Payment Method is declined.</p>
<p><strong>12.2 </strong><strong>Non-Cancelable and Non-Refundable Charges</strong>. You agree that all payments are non-cancelable for the Initial Subscription Term or the then-current Renewal Term, as applicable, and are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise agreed to by Zoom, required by Law, or set forth in your Order Form.</p>

For changes to your Charges, Zoom will provide you with not less than (i) thirty (30) calendar days prior notice, or (ii) the time period prescribed by applicable Law (each, (i) and (ii), a “<strong>Rate Change Notice</strong>”). Unless prohibited by the terms of your Order Form, any changes to your Charges will be effective upon the commencement of your next Renewal Term or other date calculated in accordance with applicable Law. If you seek to terminate or modify the Services affected by a Rate Change Notice, then you must terminate or modify your affected Services within the applicable Rate Change Notice time period. If you do not terminate or modify the affected Services within the applicable Rate Change Notice time period, then you shall be deemed to have automatically accepted the change to your Charges, unless your affirmative, express consent to such change is required under applicable Law. If required by applicable Law, we will remind you of your termination and modification right, any applicable time-period, and the consequences of not terminating.</p>
<p><strong>12.4 Promotional Rates and Discounts</strong>. Prices specified in an Order Form may include a promotional rate, discount, sale, or special offer, which may be temporary and may expire (i) per the terms of the offer, or (ii) upon the commencement of a Renewal Term.

<p><strong>12.5 </strong><strong>Collection of Charges</strong>. You agree that if Zoom is unable to collect the Charges for the Services through your Payment Method, Zoom may, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, take any other steps it deems necessary to collect such Charges from you and that you will be responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by Zoom in connection with such collection activity, including collection fees, court costs, and attorneys’ fees. You further agree that, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, Zoom may collect interest at the lesser of 1.5% per month or the highest amount permitted by Law on any Charges not paid when due.</p>
<p><strong>12.6 Support Services and Updates</strong>. Zoom will provide, at no additional costs, (i) standard support as set forth in our then-current Documentation (see <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362003-Zoom-Technical-Support">Zoom Help Center</a>), and (ii) standard updates to the Services and Software that are made generally available by Zoom to similarly situated customers in the same geographic region during the Initial Subscription Term or any applicable Renewal Term. In accordance with applicable Law and the terms of this Agreement, Zoom reserves the right to (a) modify its standard support and charge you for standard support and (b) charge you for any updates to the Services or for any premium features or functionality.</p>
<p><strong>12.7 Termination or Suspension for Nonpayment</strong>. Without limiting our rights in any other section of this Agreement, including 14.3, if any failure to pay Charges continues for five (5) calendar days following the due date, Zoom may terminate, suspend, or disconnect your Services immediately and without prior notice.</p>
<p><strong>12.8 Billing Communications</strong>. You agree that Zoom may contact you via email or otherwise at any time with information relevant to your use of the Services, including billing communications, regardless of whether you have opted out of receiving marketing communications or notices.</p>
<p><strong>12.9 Withdrawal; Cooling-Off Period</strong>. If under applicable Law you have a time period to terminate your Services based on a right of withdrawal, or a cooling-off period, you may request to terminate the affected Services in accordance with applicable Law and, if applicable, receive a pro rata refund of any prepaid and unused Charges. If the Services begin before any withdrawal or cooling-off period, or you fail to terminate your Services during the right of withdrawal or cooling-off period, then you acknowledge that you lose any termination rights under this Section 12.9. Nothing in this Section 12.9 is intended to limit or exclude any of your rights that cannot be limited or excluded under applicable Law.</p>
<li><strong> TAXES</strong></li>
<p><strong>13.1 Taxes and Fees</strong>. Unless otherwise expressly specified by Zoom as required by applicable Law, all prices shown by Zoom and Charges for the Services on your account are exclusive of Taxes and Fees. Where applicable, Taxes and Fees will be charged on the invoices issued by Zoom in accordance with applicable Laws. Zoom, in its sole discretion, will (i) calculate the amount of Taxes and Fees due, and (ii) change such amounts without notice to you.</p>
<p><strong>13.2 VAT Invoices</strong>. If required by Law, Zoom will issue a VAT invoice, or a document that the relevant taxing authority will treat as a VAT invoice, to you. You agree that this invoice may be issued electronically.</p>
<p><strong>13.3 Tax exemptions</strong>. If you are exempt from any Taxes and Fees, you will provide Zoom with all appropriate tax exemption certificates, and/or other documentation satisfactory to the applicable taxing authorities, to substantiate such exemption status. Zoom reserves the right to review and validate tax exemption documentation. If the tax exemption documentation is not provided or not valid, Zoom reserves the right to charge applicable Taxes and Fees to you.</p>
<p><strong>13.4 Payment of Taxes and Withholding</strong>. You will pay Zoom, and you are solely responsible for, any applicable Taxes and Fees. All payments made by you to us under this Agreement will be made free and clear of any deduction or withholding Taxes and Fees, as may be required by applicable Law. If any such deduction or withholding Taxes and Fees (including domestic or cross-border withholding taxes) are required on any payment, you will pay such additional amounts as necessary, such that the net amount received by us is equal to the amount then due and payable under this Agreement. We will provide you with such tax forms as reasonably requested in order to reduce or eliminate the amount of any withholding or deduction for taxes in respect of payments made under this Agreement. You also agree to provide Zoom with withholding tax certificates, upon Zoom’s request, to the extent a withholding certificate is required to be sent to Zoom under applicable Law, and you agree that Zoom may provide your withholding tax certificate to the appropriate taxing authority without further notice to you.</p>
<p><strong>13.5 Value-Added Tax – Customer Obligations</strong>. If Taxes and Fees are due towards the taxing authorities by you instead of Zoom, through the reverse charge or other similar mechanism, you will provide Zoom with all appropriate evidence for Zoom to demonstrate your business nature, such as a valid VAT registration number (or similar information required under the relevant VAT Laws). Zoom reserves the right to review and validate your VAT registration number. If the VAT registration number is not valid, Zoom reserves the right to nevertheless charge the applicable VAT to you. For the avoidance of doubt, if VAT is due by you to a taxing authority, through the reverse charge or other similar mechanism, you are solely responsible for paying those amounts to the relevant taxing authority, such that Zoom receives the full amount of payment required.</p>
<p><strong>13.6 Tax Determination</strong>. Tax determination is principally based on the location where you have established your business based on your Customer Data, or if you are an individual, where you permanently reside. This location will be defined by Zoom as your ‘Sold To’ address. Zoom reserves the right to cross reference this location against other available evidence to validate whether your location is accurate. If your location is inaccurate, Zoom reserves the right to charge you any outstanding Taxes and Fees.</p>
<p><strong>13.7 Use and Enjoyment</strong>. If you subscribe to any Services, and those Services are used and enjoyed by a subsidiary of you in a country that is different from your location as determined pursuant to Section 13.6, you confirm that, where required, you will treat this as a supply to your subsidiary. If you subscribe to the Services and those Services are used and enjoyed by a branch or individual in a country that is different to your location as determined pursuant to Section 13.6, you acknowledge that you will inform Zoom of the Services that have been allocated, and you acknowledge that Zoom reserves the right to charge Taxes and Fees based on the use and enjoyment of those Services.</p>
<p><strong>13.8 Disclosures to Taxing Authorities</strong>. In accordance with applicable tax Law, and notwithstanding any of Zoom’s notice obligations that may arise under this Agreement, including but not limited to, Section 17.4 or pursuant to our <a href="https://explore.zoom.us/en/trust/government-requests-guide/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Government Request Guide</a>, we may disclose Customer information, including Customer Confidential Information, to a tax authority without notice to you before or after the disclosure.</p>
<li><strong> TERM; TERMINATION AND SUSPENSION </strong></li>
<p><strong>14.1 Term; Automatic Renewal</strong>. Each Order Form will specify your Initial Subscription Term and any applicable Renewal Term for the Services. Unless your Order Form expressly states otherwise or applicable Law prohibits automatic renewal, each Renewal Term for the Services will begin automatically at the end of the then-current Initial Subscription Term or Renewal Term, as the case may be, unless either party provides written notice of termination or modification of the Services provided under such Order Form (i) at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the commencement of the next Renewal Term, or (ii) within the notice period required by applicable Law (collectively, (i) and (ii), the “<strong>Renewal Notice Period</strong>”). In order to terminate or modify the affected Services, you must provide notice to Zoom, via the billing portal (if available for your account) or in an email to renewals@zoom.us, in accordance with the Renewal Notice Period.

<li><strong> LIMITATION ON LIABILITY</strong></li>
<p><strong><u>READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT LIMITS OUR LIABILITY TO YOU.</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>ZOOM AND ITS AFFILIATES AND EACH OF THEIR LICENSORS, AND SUPPLIERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES;</strong></li>
<li><strong>LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY;</strong></li>
<li><strong>UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO, LOSS OF, DELETION OF, OR ALTERATION OF SYSTEM DATA, CUSTOMER CONTENT, OR CUSTOMER DATA;</strong></li>
<li><strong>COSTS RELATED TO THE PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES;</strong></li>
<li><strong>TERMINATION, SUSPENSION, DISCONTINUANCE, OR DISCONNECTION OF THE SERVICES;</strong></li>
<li><strong>A FAILURE OF YOUR INTERNET SERVICES, DOWNTIME, OR MAINTENANCE;</strong></li>
<li><strong>OUR FAILURE TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL OR OTHER SUPPORT SERVICES; OR</strong></li>
<li><strong>DAMAGES, IN THE AGGREGATE FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, EXCEEDING THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE SERVICES (IF ANY) IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT OR CIRCUMSTANCES GIVING RISE TO SUCH CLAIMS. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>THESE EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES AND LIMITATIONS ON AVAILABLE DAMAGES APPLY TO ALL CLAIMS, OBLIGATIONS, AND LIABILITIES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, AND WHETHER ARISING IN TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY), STATUTE, CONTRACT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF ZOOM, ITS AFFILIATES, OR OUR LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS  HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THAT SUCH DAMAGES MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU AND EVEN IF YOUR REMEDIES FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. </strong></p>
<p><strong>BECAUSE SOME STATES AND JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW CERTAIN EXCLUSIONS OF DAMAGES OR LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY, THE ABOVE LIMITATION ONLY APPLIES TO YOU TO THE EXTENT THAT THE EXCLUSIONS OF DAMAGES OR LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY ARE NOT PROHIBITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. </strong></p>
<li><strong> DISPUTE RESOLUTION, ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER </strong></li>
<p>You agree to resolve certain disputes with Zoom through binding arbitration (“<strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong>”). Arbitration means that an arbitrator, and not a judge or a jury, will decide the dispute. <strong>The parties expressly waive the right to bring or participate in any kind of class, collective, or mass action, private attorney general action, or any other representative action</strong>. This Arbitration Agreement supersedes all prior versions.</p>
<p><strong>27.1 Covered Disputes</strong>. You and Zoom agree that any dispute or claim between you and Zoom arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Services (a “<strong>Dispute</strong>”), including any related software, hardware, integrations, advertising or marketing communications, your account, or any aspects of your relationship or transactions with Zoom, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court. For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, a Dispute will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of this Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. LAWSUITS AND ARBITRATIONS HAVE BEEN FILED, OR MAY BE FILED IN THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD AFFECT YOU. YOUR AGREEMENT TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT COULD AFFECT YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THOSE ACTIONS.</p>
<p><strong>27.2</strong><strong> Exceptions to Arbitration</strong>. This Arbitration Agreement shall not require arbitration of the following types of claims brought by either you or Zoom: (i) small claims court actions, if the requirements of the court are met and the claims are only on an individual basis; and (ii) claims pertaining to intellectual property rights, including trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents.</p>
<p><strong>27.3 Informal Dispute Resolution First</strong>. We want to address any Disputes without needing arbitration. If you have a Dispute with Zoom, prior to initiating arbitration, you agree to mail an individualized request (“<strong>Pre-Arbitration Demand</strong>”) to ATTN: Litigation Department, Zoom Video Communications, Inc., 55 Almaden Blvd., San Jose, CA 95113 so that we can work together to resolve the Dispute. A Pre-Arbitration Demand is only valid when it pertains to, and is on behalf of, a single individual. A Pre-Arbitration Demand brought on behalf of multiple individuals is invalid as to all. The Pre-Arbitration Demand must include: (i) your name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address associated with your account; (ii) the name, telephone number, mailing address and email address of your counsel, if any; (iii) a description of your Dispute; and (iv) your signature. Likewise, if Zoom has a Dispute with you, Zoom will send an email with its individualized Pre-Arbitration Demand, including the requirements listed above, to the email address associated with your Zoom account. If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) calendar days of when either you or Zoom submitted a Pre-Arbitration Demand, an arbitration can be brought. If you or Zoom have a Dispute involving claims under the exception to arbitration in Section 27.2(2), then this Section 27.3 does not apply to such Dispute. You agree that compliance with this Section 27.3 is a condition precedent to commencing arbitration, and that the arbitrator shall dismiss any arbitration filed without fully and completely complying with these informal dispute resolution procedures.</p>
<p><strong>27.4 Arbitration Procedure</strong>. If, after completing the informal dispute resolution process set out in Section 27.3, either you or Zoom wishes to initiate arbitration, the initiating party must serve the other party with a demand for arbitration. Any demand for arbitration by you shall be sent to the Zoom Litigation Department address in Section 27.3. Zoom will send any arbitration demand to the email address associated with your Zoom account or to your counsel, if any. You and Zoom agree that the Federal Arbitration Act (“<strong>FAA</strong>”) governs this Arbitration Agreement. If the FAA cannot apply for whatever reason, then the state laws governing arbitration procedures where you reside apply.</p>
<p>The applicable arbitration provider depends on where you live. If you are a California resident, the arbitration shall be administered by ADR Services, Inc. (“<strong>ADR Services</strong>”) under its Arbitration Rules, available at <a href="https://www.adrservices.com/services-2/arbitration-rules/">https://www.adrservices.com/services-2/arbitration-rules</a>. If you are not a California resident, the arbitration shall be administered by National Arbitration and Mediation (“<strong>NAM</strong>”) under its operative Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, available at <a href="https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms">https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms</a>. This Agreement will govern to the extent it conflicts with the arbitration provider’s rules. If the applicable arbitration provider is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitration provider. If the parties cannot agree on an appropriate alternative arbitration provider, then the parties will ask a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint an arbitrator pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 5. To the extent there is a dispute over which arbitration provider has jurisdiction, a NAM arbitrator shall be appointed to resolve that dispute.</p>
<p>Arbitration hearings will take place through videoconferencing by default, unless you and Zoom agree upon another location in writing. A single arbitrator will be appointed. The arbitrator may award damages, declaratory or injunctive relief, and recoverable costs. Any arbitration award may be enforced (such as through a judgment) in any court with jurisdiction. An arbitration award shall have no preclusive effect in another arbitration or court proceeding involving Zoom and a different individual. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive authority to resolve all threshold arbitrability issues, including whether this Agreement is applicable, unconscionable, or enforceable, as well as any defense to arbitration. However, a court has exclusive authority to rule on the Mass Action Waiver in Section 27.6, including any claim that the section is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that it has been breached.</p>
<p>If a request to proceed in small claims court (see Section 27.2(1)), is made after an arbitration has been initiated, but before an arbitrator has been appointed, such arbitration shall be administratively closed. Any controversy over the small claims court’s jurisdiction shall be determined by the small claims court. If you or Zoom challenges the small claims court election in your Dispute, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the small claims court election is unenforceable, then such election shall be severed from this Arbitration Agreement as to your Dispute. However, such court determination shall have no preclusive effect in another arbitration or court proceeding involving Zoom and a different individual.</p>
<p><strong>27.5 Jury Trial Waiver</strong>. <strong>You and Zoom hereby waive any constitutional and statutory rights to sue in court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury</strong>. You and Zoom are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 27.2 above. Court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review. Discovery may be limited in arbitration, and procedures are more streamlined than in court.</p>
<p><strong>27.6 </strong><strong>Mass Action Waiver</strong>. <strong>You and Zoom agree that, except as specified in Section 27.7 below, each of us may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis and not on a class, collective, representative, or mass action basis, and the parties hereby waive all rights to have any Dispute be brought, heard, administered, resolved, or arbitrated on a class, collective, representative, or mass action basis</strong>. Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this Section 27.6 are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Zoom agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and shall be pursued in the state or federal courts located in San Jose, California. This subsection does not prevent you or Zoom from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.</p>
<p><strong>27.7 Bellwether Arbitrations</strong>. To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Zoom agree that if there are fifty (50) or more individual arbitration demands of a substantially similar nature brought against either party by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations within a one hundred and eighty (180) day period (“<strong>Mass Filing</strong>”), the parties shall select sixteen (16) individual arbitration demands (eight (8) per side) for arbitration to proceed (“<strong>Bellwether Arbitrations</strong>”). Only those sixteen (16) arbitration demands shall be filed with the arbitration provider, and the parties shall hold in abeyance, and not file, the non-Bellwether Arbitrations. Zoom will pay the arbitration provider’s costs for the sixteen (16) Bellwether Arbitrations. The statutes of limitation, including the requirement to file within one (1) year in Section 27.10 below, shall remain tolled when non-Bellwether arbitration demands are held in abeyance. While the Bellwether Arbitrations are adjudicated, no other demand for arbitration that is part of the Mass Filing may be processed, administrated, or adjudicated, and no filing or other administrative costs for such a demand for arbitration shall be due from either party to the arbitration provider. If, contrary to this provision, a party prematurely files non-Bellwether Arbitrations with the arbitration provider, the parties agree that the arbitration provider shall hold those demands in abeyance.</p>
<p>All parties agree that arbitration demands are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. Any party may request that the arbitration provider appoint a sole standing administrative arbitrator (“<strong>Administrative Arbitrator</strong>”) to determine threshold questions such as (i) whether the Bellwether Arbitration process is applicable or enforceable, (ii) whether particular demand(s) are part of a Mass Filing, and (iii) whether demands within a Mass Filing were filed in accordance with this Agreement, including Section 27.3. In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree that the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator’s costs shall be paid by Zoom.</p>
<p>The parties shall work in good faith with the arbitrator to complete each Bellwether Arbitration within one hundred and twenty (120) calendar days of its initial pre-hearing conference. The parties agree that the Bellwether Arbitration process is designed to achieve an overall faster, more efficient, and less costly mechanism for resolving Mass Filings, including the claims of individuals who are not selected for a Bellwether Arbitration.</p>
<p>Following resolution of the Bellwether Arbitrations, the parties agree to engage in a global mediation of all remaining arbitration demands comprising the Mass Filing (“<strong>Global Mediation</strong>”). The Global Mediation shall be administered by the arbitration provider administering the Bellwether Arbitrations. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining demands for arbitration comprising the Mass Filing within thirty (30) calendar days following the mediation, the remaining demands for arbitration comprising the Mass Filing shall be filed and administered by the arbitration provider on an individual basis pursuant to the arbitration provider’s rules, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise in writing. Any party may request that the arbitration provider appoint an Administrative Arbitrator to determine threshold questions regarding the newly filed demands.</p>
<p>The parties agree to cooperate in good faith with the arbitration provider to implement the Bellwether Arbitration process, including the payment of filing and administrative costs for the Bellwether Arbitrations, deferring any filing costs associated with the non-Bellwether Arbitration Mass Filings until the Bellwether Arbitrations and subsequent Global Mediation have concluded, and cooperate on any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (i) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (ii) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings. This Bellwether Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective, or mass action of any kind, or an arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision. The statutes of limitation applicable to each arbitration demand within a Mass Filing, including the requirement to file within one (1) year in Section 27.10 below, shall remain tolled from the time a party makes a Pre-Arbitration Demand to the time when that party files the arbitration demand with the arbitration provider.</p>
<p><strong>27.8 Settlement Offers and Offers of Judgment</strong>. At least ten (10) calendar days before the date set for the arbitration hearing, you or Zoom may serve a written offer of judgment upon the other party to allow judgment on specified terms. If the offer is accepted, the offer with proof of acceptance shall be submitted to the arbitration provider, who shall enter judgment accordingly. If the offer is not accepted prior to the arbitration hearing or within thirty (30) calendar days after it is made, whichever occurs first, it shall be deemed withdrawn, and cannot be given as evidence in the arbitration. If an offer made by one party is not accepted by the other party, and the other party fails to obtain a more favorable award, the other party shall not recover their post-offer costs and shall pay the offering party’s costs from the time of the offer (which, solely for purposes of offers of judgment, may include reasonable attorneys’ fees to the extent they are recoverable by statute, in an amount not to exceed the damages awarded).</p>
<p>The parties agree that any disputes with respect to settlement offer(s) or offer(s) of judgment in a Mass Filing are to be resolved by a single arbitrator to the extent such offers contain the same material terms. For arbitrations involving represented parties, the represented parties’ attorneys agree to communicate individual settlement offer(s) or offer(s) of judgment to each and every arbitration claimant or respondent to whom such offers are extended.</p>
<p><strong>27.9 Arbitration Costs</strong>. Except as provided for in a Mass Filing (see Section 27.7), your responsibility to pay any filing, administrative, and arbitrator costs will be solely as set forth in the applicable arbitration provider’s rules. If you have a gross monthly income of less than 300% of the federal poverty guidelines, you may be entitled to a waiver of certain arbitration costs.</p>
<p><strong>27.10 Requirement to File Within One Year</strong>. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, and notwithstanding any other statute of limitations, any claim or cause of action under this Agreement (with the exception of disputes under Section 27.2(2)) must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose, or else that claim or cause of action will be permanently barred. The statute of limitations and any arbitration cost deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process required by Section 27.3 above.</p>
<p><strong>27.11 Opt-Out</strong>. You may reject this Arbitration Agreement and opt out of arbitration by sending an email to opt-out@zoom.us within (i) thirty (30) calendar days of April 1, 2023 if you are an existing user, or (ii) thirty (30) calendar days of the date you created your account if you are a new user. Your opt-out notice must be individualized and must be sent from the email address associated with your individual Zoom account. An opt-out notice that purports to opt out multiple parties will be invalid as to all such parties. No individual (or their agent or representative) may effectuate an opt out on behalf of other individuals. Your notice to opt-out must include your first and last name, address, the email address associated with your Zoom account, and an unequivocal statement that you decline this Arbitration Agreement. If you do decide to opt out, that opt out will apply to this Arbitration Agreement and all previous versions thereof, and neither party will have the right to compel the other to arbitrate any Dispute. However, all other parts of this Arbitration Agreement will continue to apply to you, and opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may enter into in the future with us.</p>
<p><strong>27.12 Severability</strong>. Except as provided in Section 27.6 above, if any provision of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then that provision will be severed; however, the remaining provisions shall still apply and shall be interpreted to achieve the closest possible intent to the original intent of this section, inclusive of the severed provision.</p>

		<h2>Kennedy School study puts annual Mass. costs at $64 billion, hopes figure will be used as a comparison in mass-transit spending decisions</h2>	</p>

	<div>

				<p>If you think the cost of driving is borne only by individuals who own cars, you may want to think again.</p>
<p>And you might be surprised just how pricey it is.</p>
<p>A team of graduate students at the Harvard Kennedy School estimate that the annual price tag for maintaining <a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/publications/64-billion-massachusetts-vehicle-economy">Massachusetts’ car economy is roughly $64.1 billion</a>, with more than half of that coming from public funds. While they didn’t perform an analysis for all the states, the group notes that the cost structure would be similar.</p>
<p>“This is a huge number,” said the paper’s lead author, Stevie Olson, M.P.P. ’20. “It’s unexpected because the majority of drivers, citizens, consumers experience roads for free. You just drive out your parking lot, your driveway, and you’re on the road. No one’s charging you, but there’s all of these costs that are both public costs, indirect externalities that are also costs, and then private costs that people are incurring.”</p>
<p>The paper, which the students wrote as part of an applied lab course, found that costs are diffused across a number of areas and involve things people don’t often consider. Beyond those for individual drivers, road maintenance, snow removal, and policing, there are less-obvious ones, such as those associated with added pollution, value of land set aside for parking lots, lost productivity from sitting in traffic, and various costs associated with injuries and deaths on the road.</p>
<p>Using publicly available data, the authors put the annual public tab at $35.7 billion, which amounts to about $14,000 for every household in the state. Those that do own vehicles pony up an additional $12,000 on average in direct costs.</p>
<p>The authors say their goal is to demonstrate the total costs of driving so that information can be used for comparison when held up against other types of transit investments, like bus, subway, and train systems.</p>

<p>“If you think about it as an equation, this is a variable that has not been in the conversation, and it’s something that should we be considering as we think about what is the best way to provide transportation options to the public,” said Linda Bilmes, the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Senior Lecturer in Public Policy at the Kennedy School.</p>
<p>“We’re not trying to say that cars are bad or that we don’t need roads,” said Bilmes, who oversaw the study. “We’re just trying to say that if we think about the overall cost/benefit analyses around transportation when it comes to this conversation, not only is there a cost to the vehicle economy, but the cost is actually larger than we may have realized.”</p>
<p>For example, “When we think about the cost of investing in public transportation, we tend to think about it as if the alternative is free, as if we are spending several billion on the North-South Rail Link [a project connecting the Massachusetts’s largest railroad stations] as opposed to not spending any money,” Bilmes added.</p>
<p>The study was written as part of Bilmes’ “Greater Boston Applied Field Lab,” which provides students experiential learning opportunities working with state and local government. The lab takes on external clients who pose real-world questions relating to finance and operations. Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton ’01, M.P.A./M.B.A. ’11, suggested the study and helped connect the graduate students to officials in his district.</p>
<p>“I asked for this study because we lead the country in bad traffic, and the best solution to that problem is building a reliable, regional, electrified rail system,” Moulton said in an email. “But, a lot of people point to the cost of a rail system as the excuse not to do it. They advocate for wider roads and other short-sighted fixes, but the truth is we pay massive amounts to subsidize car travel and don’t even know it. Professor Bilmes and her students finally put a price tag on driving.”</p>
<p>In the paper, the students broke down the total costs into three buckets: direct budgetary costs, indirect social and economic costs (which include many of the more intangible costs), and private costs. The first two buckets make up the $35.7 billion the public pays and the third bucket is the additional $28.4 billion car owners foot. It accounts for driver expenses like gas, regular maintenance and repair, depreciation, and financing.</p>
<p>To get these figures students worked with the mayor’s office from the city of Lynn to average what the city spends on roads over five years. They then used that data to estimate what the state’s other 351 municipalities spend. The team also went through the overall state budget and those of various agencies like the Department of Conservation and Recreation to calculate all the money going to roads. Students also spoke to a number of scholars and experts in the vehicle economy to determine the most reliable statistics to use in their calculating model for figures not in the budgets they looked at.</p>
<p>The authors, some of whom have graduated, hope their model will be recreated in other states.</p>
<p>“While the $64 billion cost applies to Massachusetts, the costs of the vehicle economy are similar across states,” Olson said. “The price tag for this infrastructure is big in every state, and you can imagine collectively as a nation that the total is huge. We can use the study to think about urban travel, such as in a metropolitan area, but we can also use it to start thinking about interstate travel. The study illuminates tradeoffs that we make when investing in transportation infrastructure, and, rather than think of roads as free, we need to realize that significant resources go into the operation of the motor vehicle economy.”</p>
<p>“We need leaders in our state who look beyond the cars in front of us to make smart decisions about our transportation future,” Moulton said. “This study will help us do it.”</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Postgres Language Server</h2>
<p dir="auto">A Language Server for Postgres. Not SQL with flavors, just Postgres.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Status</h2>
<p dir="auto"><g-emoji alias="construction" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f6a7.png">🚧</g-emoji> This is in active development and is only ready for collaborators. The majority of work is still ahead, but we've verified that the approach works. We're making this public so that we can develop it in the open with input from the community.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2>
<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/" rel="nofollow">Language Server Protocol</a> is an open protocol between code editors and servers to provide code intelligence tools such as code completion and syntax highlighting. This project implements such a language server for Postgres, significantly enhancing the developer experience within your favorite editor by adding:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Semantic Highlighting</li>
<li>Syntax Error Diagnostics</li>
<li>Show SQL comments on hover</li>
<li>Auto-Completion</li>
<li>Code actions such as <code>Execute the statement under the cursor</code>, or <code>Execute the current file</code></li>
<li>Optionated Code Formatting</li>
<li>... and many more</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Motivation</h2>
<p dir="auto">Despite the rising popularity of Postgres, support for the PL/pgSQL in IDEs and editors is limited. While there are some <em>generic</em> SQL Language Servers<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1-dfc07bdecba4ba3de7afb79a0e5b6345" id="user-content-fnref-1-dfc07bdecba4ba3de7afb79a0e5b6345" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> offering the Postgres syntax as a "flavor" within the parser, they usually fall short due to the ever-evolving and complex syntax of PostgreSQL. There are a few proprietary IDEs<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2-dfc07bdecba4ba3de7afb79a0e5b6345" id="user-content-fnref-2-dfc07bdecba4ba3de7afb79a0e5b6345" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> that work well, but the features are only available within the respective IDE.</p>
<p dir="auto">This Language Server is designed to support Postgres, and only Postgres. The server uses <a href="https://github.com/pganalyze/libpg_query">libg_query</a>, therefore leveraging the PostgreSQL source to parse the SQL code reliably. Using Postgres within a Language Server might seem unconventional, but it's the only reliable way of parsing all valid PostgreSQL queries. You can find a longer rationale on why This is the Way™ <a href="https://pganalyze.com/blog/parse-postgresql-queries-in-ruby" rel="nofollow">here</a>. While libg_query was built to execute SQL, and not to build a language server, any shortcomings have been successfully mitigated in the <code>parser</code> crate. You can read the <a href="https://github.com/supabase/postgres_lsp/blob/main/crates/parser/src/lib.rs">commented source code</a> for more details on the inner workings of the parser.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once the parser is stable, and a robust and scalable data model is implemented, the language server will not only provide basic features such as semantic highlighting, code completion and syntax error diagnostics, but also serve as the user interface for all the great tooling of the Postgres ecosystem.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Roadmap</h2>
<p dir="auto">This is a proof of concept for building both a concrete syntax tree and an abstract syntax tree from a potentially malformed PostgreSQL source code. The <code>postgres_lsp</code> crate was created to prove that it works end-to-end, and is just a very basic language server with semantic highlighting and error diagnostics. Before further feature development, we have to complete a bit of groundwork:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><em>Finish the parser</em>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The parser works, but the enum values for all the different syntax elements and internal conversations are manually written or copied, and, in some places, only cover a few elements required for a simple select statement. To have full coverage without possibilities for a copy and paste error, they should be generated from <code>pg_query.rs</code> source code. (<a href="https://github.com/supabase/postgres_lsp/pull/4" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/supabase/postgres_lsp/pull/4/hovercard">#4</a>)</li>
<li>There are a few cases such as nested and named dollar quoted strings that cause the parser to fail due to limitations of the regex-based lexer. Nothing that is impossible to fix, or requires any fundamental change in the parser though.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Implement a robust and scalable data model</em>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>This is still in a research phase</li>
<li>A great rationale on the importance of the data model in a language server can be found <a href="https://matklad.github.io/2023/05/06/zig-language-server-and-cancellation.html" rel="nofollow">here</a></li>
<li><code>rust-analyzer</code>s <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/tree/master/crates/base-db"><code>base-db</code> crate</a> will serve as a role model</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa"><code>salsa</code></a> crate will most likely be the underlying data structure</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Setup the language server properly</em>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>This is still in a research phase</li>
<li>Once again <code>rust-analyzer</code> will serve as a role model, and we will most likely implement the same queueing and cancellation approach</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Implement basic language server features</em>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Semantic Highlighting</li>
<li>Syntax Error Diagnostics</li>
<li>Show SQL comments on hover</li>
<li>Auto-Completion</li>
<li>Code Actions, such as <code>Execute the statement under the cursor</code>, or <code>Execute the current file</code></li>
<li>... anything you can think of really</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are two aspects to Zig's simple error handling: error sets and try/catch. Zig's error set are essentially a specialized enum that can be created implicitly:</p>
<pre><code>fn divide(dividend: u32, divisor: u32) !u32 {
  if (divisor == 0) {
    return error.DivideByZero;
  }
  return dividend / divisor;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Which is, in effect, the same as making it explicit:</p>
<pre><code>const DivideError = error {
  DivideByZero
};

fn divide(dividend: u32, divisor: u32) !u32 {
  if (divisor == 0) {
    return DivideError.DivideByZero;
  }
  return dividend / divisor;
}
</code></pre>
<p>In both cases our function returns an <code>!u32</code> where the exclamation mark, <code>!</code>, indicates that this function can return an error. Again, we can either be explicit about the error(s) that our function returns or implicit. In both of the above case, we've taken the implicit route.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we could have used an explicit return type: <code>error{DivideByZero}!u32</code>. In the 2nd case we could have used the explicit error set: <code>DivideError!u32</code>.</p>
<p>Zig has a special type, <code>anyerror</code>, which can represent any error. It's worth pointing out that the return types <code>!u32</code> and <code>anyerror!u32</code> are different. The first form, the implicit return type, leaves it up to the compiler to determine what error(s) our function can return. There are cases where the compiler might not be able to infer type where we'll need to be explicit, or, if you're lazy like me, use <code>anyerror</code>. It's worth pointing out that the only time I've run into this is when defining a function pointer type.</p>
<p>Calling a function that returns an error, as <code>divide</code> does, requires handling the error. We have two options. We can use <code>try</code> to bubble the error up or use <code>catch</code> to handle the error. <code>try</code> is like Go's tedious <code>if err != nil { return err }</code>:</p>
<pre><code>pub fn main() !void {
  const result = try divide(100, 10);
  _ = result; // use result
}
</code></pre>
<p>This works because <code>main</code> itself returns an error via <code>!void</code>. <code>catch</code> isn't much more complicated:</p>
<pre><code>const result = divide(100, 10) catch |err| {
  // handle the error, maybe log, or use a default
}
</code></pre>
<p>For more complicated cases, a common pattern is to switch on the caught error. From the top-level handler in <a href="https://github.com/karlseguin/http.zig/blob/bda55c35c6167d073f3ec5e870b6fce89651d35b/src/httpz.zig#L289">http.zig</a>:</p>
<pre><code>self.dispatch(action, req, res) catch |err| switch (err) {
  error.BodyTooBig =&gt; {
    res.status = 431;
    res.body = "Request body is too big";
    res.write() catch return false;
  },
  error.BrokenPipe, error.ConnectionResetByPeer =&gt; return false,
  else =&gt; self._errorHandler(req, res, err),
}
</code></pre>
<p>Another somewhat common case with <code>catch</code> is to use <code>catch unreachable</code>. If <code>unreachable</code> is reached, the panic handler is executed. Applications can define their own panic handler, or <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/1c7798a3cde9e8dad31c276aab4c1affb2043ad2/lib/std/builtin.zig#L733">rely on the default one</a>. I use <code>catch unreachable</code> a lot in test code.</p>
<p>One final thing worth mentioning is <code>errdefer</code> which is like <code>defer</code> (think Go's <code>defer</code>) but it only executes if the function returns an error. This is extremely useful. You can see an example of it in the <a href="https://github.com/karlseguin/zuckdb.zig/blob/master/src/conn.zig#L27">duckdb driver</a></p>
<pre><code>pub fn open(db: DB) !Conn {
  const allocator = db.allocator;

  var slice = try allocator.alignedAlloc(u8, CONN_ALIGNOF, CONN_SIZEOF);

  // if we `return error.ConnectFail` a few lines down, this will execute 
  errdefer allocator.free(slice);

  const conn: *c.duckdb_connection = @ptrCast(slice.ptr);

  if (c.duckdb_connect(db.db.*, conn) == DuckDBError) {
    // if we reach this point and return an error, our above `errdefer` will execute
    return error.ConnectFail;
  }

  // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>A serious challenge with Zig's simple approach to errors that our errors are nothing more than enum values. We cannot attach additional information or behavior to them. I think we can agree that being told "SyntaxError" when trying to parse an invalid JSON, with no other context, isn't great. This is currently an <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/2647">open issue</a>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, for more complex cases where I want to attach extra data to or need to attach behavior, I've settled on leveraging Zig's tagged unions to create generic Results. Here's an example from a PostgreSQL driver I'm playing with:</p>
<pre><code>pub fn Result(comptime T: type) T {
  return union(enum) {
    ok: T,
    err: Error,
  };
}

pub const Error = struct {
  raw: []const u8, // fields all reference this data
  allocator: Allocator, // we copy raw to ensure it outlives the connection

  code: []const u8,
  message: []const u8,
  severity: []const u8,

  pub fn deinit(self: Error) void {
    self.allocator.free(self.raw);
  }
};
</code></pre>
<p>Because Zig has exhaustive switching, we can still be sure that callers will have to handle errors one way or another. However, using this approach means  that the convenience of <code>try</code>, <code>catch</code> and <code>errdefer</code> are no longer available. Instead, you'd have to do something like:</p>
<pre><code>const conn = switch (pg.connect()) {
  .ok =&gt; |conn| conn,
  .err =&gt; |err|  // TODO handle err
}
</code></pre>
<p>The "TODO handle err" is going to be specific to the application, but you could log the error and/or convert it into a standard zig error.</p>
<p>In our above <code>Error</code> you'll note that we've defined a <code>deinit</code> function to free <code>self.raw</code>. So this is an example where our error has additional data (the <code>code</code>, <code>message</code> and <code>severity</code>) as well as behavior (freeing memory owned by the error).</p>
<p>To compensate for our loss of <code>try</code> and <code>catch</code>, we can enhance or <code>Result(T)</code> type. I haven't come up with anything great, but I do tend to add an <code>unwrap</code> function and a <code>deinit</code> function (assuming either <code>Error</code> or <code>T</code> implement <code>deinit</code>):</p>
<pre><code>pub fn unwrap(self: Self) !T {
  switch(self) {
    .ok =&gt; |ok| return ok,
    .err =&gt; |err| {
      err.deinit();
      return error.PG;
    }
  }
}

pub fn deinit(self: Self) void {
  switch (self) {
    .err =&gt; |err| err.deinit(),
    .ok =&gt; |value| {
      if (comptime std.meta.trait.hasFn("deinit")(T)) {
        value.deinit();
      }
    },
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Unlike Rust's <code>unwrap</code> which will panic on error, I've opted to convert <code>Error</code> into an generic error  (which can then be used with Zig's built-in facilities). As for exposing <code>deinit</code> directly on <code>Result(T)</code> it just provides an alternative way to program against the result. Combined, we can consume <code>Result(T)</code> as such:</p>
<pre><code>const result = pg.connect();
defer result.deinit();  // will be forwarded to either `T` or `Error`
const conn = try result.unwrap();
</code></pre>
<p>In the end, the current error handling is sufficient in most cases, but I think anyone who tries to parse JSON using <code>std.json</code> will immediately recognize a gap in Zig's capabilities. You can work around those gaps by, for example, introducing a <code>Result</code> type, but then you lose the integration with the language. Of particular note, I would say losing <code>errdefer</code> is more than just an ergonomic issue.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

      

      <p>In 1945, Vannevar Bush proposed the idea of <em>memex</em>, a hypertext system. It came two decades before the internet and almost half a century before the web. Because of the time in which it was invented, it was envisioned as a mechanical device: a desk with cards and a mechanism for showing them to the user.</p>
<p><img src="https://filiph.net/text/imgs/memex.webp"></p><p>Vannevar Bush described a device which would store the users books, records, and communications. There was a concept of memex “trails” that linked from one document to another. Memex was to be an “enlarged intimate supplement to one’s memory”.</p>
<!-- [Quote with the dentist] -->
<p>The concept of the memex was highly influential, eventually leading to the invention of the World Wide Web and its Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).</p>
<p>For this reason, some people assume that the web is an advanced version of memex. But in fact, the web is a terrible approximation of Vannevar Bush’s original vision.</p>
<h2 id="memex-trails">Memex trails</h2>
<p>The web is a hypertext, and one of the most influential inventions in human history, but it is not memex.</p>
<ul>
<li>On the web, documents aren’t yours. Almost universally, what you read on the internet is on someone’s else server. You cannot edit it, or annotate it.</li>
<li>There are hyperlinks on the web, but again, they are not yours. They are added as simple, unidirectional links by the original authors of whatever it is you’re reading. You can’t add your own link between two pages on New York Times that you find relevant. You can’t create a “trail” of web documents, photographs and pages that are somehow relevant to a topic you’re researching. You can’t annotate a relationship between two paragraphs on two separate sites.</li>
</ul>
<p>What Vannevar Bush proposed with memex wasn’t a publishing platform. It was a memory expansion device.</p>
<!-- IMAGE: galactic brain -->
<p>His “trails” are similar in concept to a physical binder that contains documents that you can freely annotate, highlight and interlink. Any given document can of course be in multiple different binders, and its annotations and links depend on the context. Even for a single person, every “page” can exist in several different forms, depending on what the person is researching or trying to remember at the moment.</p>
<h2 id="memex-today">Memex today</h2>
<p>We live in a knowledge economy. This blog is primarily for developers, and software development is in many ways a research job. But almost any other occupation that pays these days has some element of attaining and using knowledge. You’d think we’d be all over memex and its idea of memory expansion. But chances are pretty high that this is the first time you’re hearing about memex at all, or that the last time you heard about it was years ago.</p>
<p>There are projects that explore this space, of course. The most obvious descendant is Ted Nelson’s Xanadu project, a piece of software more than 50 years in the making. You can see its 2016’s incarnation in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMKy52Intac">this video</a>.</p>
<!-- VIDEO -->
<p>I think you’ll agree with me that, while Xanadu is a lot closer to the idea of memex than the web, it’s kind of underwhelming as a piece of software. I remember playing with it a few years back, and I just didn’t find it that compelling.</p>
<p>There are more pragmatic descendants of memex. The Federated Wiki project is one. The various personal knowledge bases are close to memex, too.</p>
<p>And look, if you’re in the mood of exploring new software, you should stop reading now and see if any of the above is a good fit for you. I know the urge to try something new and shiny. Especially in productivity software, I can seldom resist. I have used about 4 different TODO apps and over 5 different text editors in the past 10 years alone. So, go ahead and indulge yourself if you need to.</p>
<!-- IMAGE of my tray -->
<p>But this article is not about any of these direct descendants of memex. The memex of today is way more pedestrian.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Here’s the thing. If I’m being honest, most of my experiments with the different memex descendants mentioned above just kind of faded after a few weeks or months. And the reason is not just habit. If they were such a huge boon to my productivity, I’d change my habit the same way I changed it for better IDEs, better social media consumption strategies, or better terminal defaults.</p>
<p>No, the reason those shiny new apps don’t stick is <strong>interoperability</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="interoperability">Interoperability</h2>
<p>Interoperability is more important than features. A piece of software that works with your existing files, and which <em>people around you can use</em>, will generally win over some new way of doing things that you first need to migrate to, and then also ask <em>others around you</em> to migrate to as well.</p>
<p>The clean slate and the excitement that a new piece of technology gives you is tempting. But no matter how cool a piece of software is, if you can’t work with others, then you’re paying too much for the thrill.</p>
<!-- [IMAGE: BloorpyBase (an imagined productivity suite by Filip Hracek)] -->
<p>Imagine that you and I are working in the same company. I tell you there’s a new project for us two to work on. I explain it to you and you get reasonably excited. And then I tell you that I’ve started a new “bloorp” in BloorpyBase, a piece of software from 2012 that almost nobody uses. You grudgingly install BloorpyBase. The app doesn’t use the same keyboard shortcuts you’re used to. The shortcut normally assigned to adding a comment instead minimizes all windows. <em>Sigh.</em> You try to link some exploratory source code to it, but BloorpyBase only works with Mercurial. <em>Sigh.</em> You read some of my initial thoughts and try to respond but you don’t know what’s the best way to do it. Should you create another bloorp? Should you make a suggestion, or an edit? You spend half an hour reading a “How To Bloorp” guide on the internet but come back empty handed. <em>Sigh.</em></p>
<p>Unless BloorpyBase gives the average person a significant productivity boost, it’s not happening.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-basics">Back to basics</h2>
<p>Alright, so what is it that we really want from memex? It must be easy to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>edit</strong> content in the memex</li>
<li><strong>add</strong> completely new pieces of material to any given memex “trail”</li>
<li><strong>link</strong> form parts of the memex to other parts of the memex</li>
<li><strong>comment</strong> on specific parts of the memex</li>
</ul>
<p>And when I say these things must be <strong>easy</strong>, I mean they must be easy for the average person. Not just for you and me and a couple of other nerds. For everyone.</p>
<p>It’s fine if some parts of memex are hard to use or require training. But the basics should be obvious and accessible. The learning curve can be steep at some point, but it must be gentle or flat at the very beginning.</p>
<!-- [IMAGE - learning curve] -->
<h2 id="memex-is-already-here-its-just-not-evenly-distributed">Memex is already here, it’s just not evenly distributed</h2>
<p>If you look back at the list above, you'll realize that these things are already very much possible. They might not be in a single shiny app, but that doesn’t matter. (In fact, it’s probably <em>better</em>, in many ways, that today’s memex isn’t a single app. We'll get back to this later.)</p>
<!-- [IMAGE - expectation] -->
<p>To create a new memex “trail” in the year 2020, just create a shared folder (in Zoho Workdrive, Dropbox, Synology Drive, Google Drive, OneDrive, iCloud, etc.) and put some documents in it. That’s it.</p>
<!-- [IMAGE - disappointment] -->
<p>I know: it’s not glorious. It’s not shiny. It’s just a boring old folder with boring old documents. But I hope to persuade you that it’s good enough, and that you don’t need to wait for some vaporware to work the way Vannevar Bush imagined in 1945.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-memex">How to memex</h2>
<p>Not everyone who is using a shared folder is using it as a memex. In fact, I estimate that 99% of people don’t.</p>
<p>To really take the technology of today and use it the way Vannevar Bush envisioned, you need to use it in a specific way. I'll walk you through it here, but you must know that this is just one way, and it’s not very rigid. No shared folder software <em>forces</em> you to use it in any given way. You must train yourself. You must invent your own system on top of what technology you already have, and you have to persist in applying it.</p>
<!-- [IMAGE memex today == boring technology + system + perseverance] -->
<p>Imagine that you have a project. It could be anything. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Significantly improve the performance of your employer’s app</li>
<li>Delve into some legacy code for the first time</li>
<li>Analyze viability of a business idea</li>
<li>Decide on the next car to buy</li>
<li>Learn SQL</li>
<li>Track your kid’s progress</li>
<li>Learn as much as you can about your own metabolism</li>
</ul>
<p>Note how some of these projects are work-related, others personal. Some will be solo, others will be pusued in a team. Some have a concrete deliverable, others are ongoing. But all of them require some research, and would benefit from recording the acquired knowledge.</p>
<p>As I said above, to create a new memex trail, you just create a new shared folder. I highly recommend giving it a memorable, descriptive and searchable name. For example, “website 3” is short and easy, but “example.com redesign 2019” is better. In some cases, you may want to invent a codename.  For example, “Project Gandalf” is more memorable (and fun) than “kid progress tracker”.</p>
<p>To make this more concrete, I'll pick a single project and I will spend the rest of this “how to” section describing it in detail. I think you won’t have any issues generalizing this to other projects.</p>
<p>My project pick is “significantly improve the performance of your employer’s app”, and I’m going to call it “Project Sloth (2020 perf optimization)”. Since this is a work project, I create the folder in my company’s shared drive.</p>
<!-- [IMAGE - project Sloth drive folder, or a document] -->
<p>At first, I just add a single document in this folder. This is the project’s main document, or “index”. It probably has the same name as the folder. It should serve as a guide to the project, for others in the company as well as for me (when I look at it 2 years from now). In here, I describe the project and I link to other stuff inside the folder (and outside of it, if needed).</p>
<p>The “Project Sloth” document should probably start with some “Background” section. It can be a single paragraph that says something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2019-2020, we have seen a sharp increase of reports from our users that the app is too slow. (Link to some evidence to back up this claim, ideally.) On a meeting on October 18, 2020, Alice, Bob and I decided that this needs to be addressed. I volunteered for this project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The index document then lists some basic information (e.g. “app was built using technology X”) and goals (e.g. “decrease startup time on phone Y by 50%”).</p>
<p>The rest of this document can be a “trail” of content. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial metrics and the methodology of measuring them</li>
<li>Quotes from articles as I learn more about how to improve performance in technology X</li>
<li>Some failed ideas and why they were rejected</li>
<li>Pseudocode</li>
<li>Meeting notes</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally, this content is structured with thematic sections. But I can start with just chronologically taking notes for now.</p>
<p>Pretty soon, my single document does not suffice anymore. I need to add more supporting data into my folder, and link to it from the index doc.</p>
<!-- [IMAGE folder] -->
<p>Once I start comparing different approaches, it makes sense to create a spreadsheet. It lists the different things I’m considering, their pros and cons, and some guesstimates. I link to this spreadsheet from the index doc, where I just summarize the final outcome of my analysis.</p>
<p>Later, I write a benchmark harness. At this point, this is just an ugly bag of shell scripts. They could go into a throwaway repository, but I can also put them in a subdirectory of my project’s folder. In any case, I need to link to that code from my index doc.</p>
<p>Let’s say that this benchmark harness has the ability to check my company’s app’s performance at any given commit in the history of the app. I let the shell scripts work over the night, producing a huge amount of historical data. This could be another spreadsheet, but if it’s really a lot of data, it could be a SQLite database. I place the database file in — you guessed it — the project’s shared folder, and link to it from the index file.</p>
<p>Pretty soon, the “Project Sloth” folder is teeming with content. Original documents, code, PDFs, presentations, screenshots, spreadsheets, data files, iPython notebooks, videos. All of these are relevant to our project, though some of them may be symbolic links (in other words, they also exist in other folders in my company’s shared drive). The index document links to all of them. It summarizes the most salient points of each: it reproduces a graph here, or a quote there.</p>
<p>I have my memex trail for this project.</p>
<h2 id="use-your-memex">Use your memex</h2>
<p>Even if I deleted the folder at this point, it would all still be a beneficial exercise. By putting all of this together, I need to organize my own thoughts. I get to see everything in context. I understand the problem more clearly.</p>
<p>But I’m not deleting the folder, am I. I can now direct other people in my company to have a look. They might help, by giving me feedback, adding more data, or by throwing resources at me. If the project becomes important enough to get a team, new team members have a much easier time getting on board.</p>
<p>And when I inevitably need to review something a few months from now, I know exactly where to look. For example, I will want to measure whether the app is actually getting faster, and I will want to use the exact same methodology and code as at the start. Thankfully, both are right there in my memex trail.</p>

<p>Memex is here, it just won’t happen automatically. There’s no magical piece of software that will do that work for you (and maybe there never will). <em>You</em> will have to learn how to summarize, organize and explain. <em>You</em> will have to decide which problems require which files types (document, spreadsheet, image, etc.). <em>You</em> have to have the perseverance to continue updating your trails.</p>
<p>It will hurt. It will suck. It’s not like starting to use a new, elegant tool on some pet project. A lot of brain power needs to go into this, and it’s mostly boring, menial work. But hey, nobody said this stuff is easy. Not even Vannevar Bush. None of us are entitled to easy work.</p>
<h2 id="but-where-is-my-cool-dashboard">But where is my cool dashboard?</h2>
<p>Look, I love Minority Report’s vision of future work interfaces as much as any other geek. I’m also <em>really</em> into cool-looking dashboards.</p>
<!-- [IMAGE - minority report gif] -->
<p>But even I have to admit that their utility is limited. Dashboards are not nearly as flexible as your operating system’s window manager. Just open the links in separate windows and voilá: you have your own bespoke, interactive dashboard. You’re like Tom Cruise in Minority Report, except your interface is a little more boring (and requires a lot less arm strength to move a window).</p>
<p>Add a second monitor to your setup if you can, and you’re more productive than most of your sci-fi movie heroes. (Have you ever stopped to think how incredibly frustrating it would be to use a Star Trek-level UI for anything else than browsing a simplified encyclopedia?)</p>
<h2 id="but-isnt-this-something-we-could-have-been-doing-since-about-the-late-1990s">But isn’t this something we could have been doing since about the late 1990s?</h2>
<p>Yes. (Although some things, like interlinking between documents, were a <em>lot</em> harder back then.)</p>
<h2 id="what-about-evernote--onenote--simplenote--dropbox-paper">What about Evernote / OneNote / SimpleNote / Dropbox Paper?</h2>
<p>If your organization uses any of these apps extensively, that’s great. I think it’s very close. As far as I know, these software packages lack the “shared folder” part, which is a show stopper for me (many of my projects have some files or code involved). <del>But I love Evernote’s editor for taking notes, for example. Much faster than Google Docs.</del></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE from 2023:</strong> Evernote’s editor <em>used to be</em> much faster than Google Docs, but became <em>slower</em>. I now use Obsidian for my note taking and editing. Same idea.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-just-using-zohogooglemicrosoftapple-for-everything">What about just using Zoho/Google/Microsoft/Apple for everything?</h2>
<p>All of these suites definitely get additional value from integrating several different apps into one. For example, you can paste a chart from a Google Spreadsheet into a Google Doc, and the chart will be automatically updated.</p>
<p>But:</p>
<ol>
<li>I don’t see the more integrated features used often enough — a simple screenshot and a link will suffice most of the time, for example, instead of trying to get a self-updating embed to work.</li>
<li>There is always something missing in these suites — can’t run a bash script saved in Google Drive, can’t have a huge database in Spreadsheets, and so on.</li>
<li>Vendor lock in is real. A simple rich text document can be easily ported. A heavily feature-dependent thing, not so much.</li>
</ol>
<p>I do use many of the niceties of the Google apps ecosystem every day. But it’s not memex, and shouldn’t be. We have too much aggregation as it is.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-have-everything-in-a-bespoke-cloud-environment">Why not have everything in a bespoke cloud environment?</h2>
<p>Everything is possible. I could have something running in the cloud that could run the aforementioned bash scripts in a Google Drive folder, and update other files in that folder accordingly.</p>
<p>But setting it all up is a pain. Yes, you can run an arbitrary program in the cloud, then hook up an online spreadsheet to use this output. But remember, we’re talking about research projects. You'll have about a dozen of those every year. Each will be different. For example, for one of my past project, I needed to build a bespoke python GUI tool to help me categorize hundreds of websites. Sure, I could have built a small web app. But building a tiny pygame app was much, much easier.</p>
<h2 id="but-do-i-have-to">But, do I have to?</h2>
<p>You don’t need memex. You don’t need to do any of this shared folder nonsense. 99% of people don’t, and many of them are doing just fine in their careers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, memex is something that will give you an edge.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your decisions are backed by sources and data.</li>
<li>You can go back to these decisions much later.</li>
<li>You can get someone’s review of your ideas in their entirety, instead of asking question by question.</li>
<li>You gather knowledge much faster than you would by just asking stuff.</li>
<li>If you ever end up in a large organization, these tools are a huge multiplier of your efforts. In a huge organization, it is unlikely you will be able to talk to everyone you need to reach. But your memex on a particular topic can easily reach hundreds of people.</li>
<li>When you start putting things on a page, and backing them by data, you’ll find you have to be a lot more precise about your reasoning. You can’t just hand-wave some stuff like you unwittingly do when you’re just pondering something in your head.</li>
<li>You’ll train yourself to “do the (boring) work”. This is important. Self-discipline is what separates high-performers from the rest. (There’s a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=geoff+colvin+talent+is+overrated">book about it</a>.)</li>
<li>You’ll train yourself to accept criticism. By putting your reasoning in a document and letting others see it, it’s now open for all. All the warts and errors are now out there.</li>
<li>Being able to back decisions by data and research and persuade others (again, by data and research) is one of the important stepping stones to becoming a senior developer or a tech lead.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, again, don’t wait for memex to come in a neatly tied package anytime soon. And know that you can build your own memex today, by combining widely available software, a loose system of working with it, and perseverance.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p>Dutch designer and illustrator Robin Stam has permanently changed the landscape of one corner of the Netherlands. Taking inspiration from the bridges depicted on euro banknotes, Stam had decided to turn them into reality. Funnily enough, the images of bridges on the euro banknotes were completely imaginary and didn’t actually exist anywhere in Europe. They were <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/euro-area/euro-coins-and-notes/euro-banknotes_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Austrian artist Robert Kalina’s</a> way of echoing the major ages and architectural styles of Europe.</p><p>Designer Stam thought it was a pity the bridges were fictional, so he rolled up his sleeves and brought them to life. Now, Stam’s colorful and iconic bridges, built near a housing estate, continue to brighten up the city of Spijkenisse, near Rotterdam, for nearly a decade.</p><p>Stam told <strong>Bored Panda</strong> more about his bridge project, the moment when he came up with the idea, and about the design and building process.

banknotes were introduced, I wasn’t really surprised by the design. Years later, I was fascinated by the concept of the design of something as big as money. So I checked out the concept and design of Robert Kalina, the designer of the Euronotes. In addition to windows and gateways, these seven banknotes also depict several bridges,” Stam said.</p><p>“Each bridge has an individual appearance, all of which can be recognized as having originated throughout certain periods in European cultural history. The bridges are meant to illustrate the tight collaboration and communication between Europe and the rest of the world in general, but more importantly, amongst the European countries in particular. However, the bridges portrayed in the banknotes are fictional.”</p><p>“I was sitting in a pizza place with the bill when I first thought of the fact that it would be amazing if these fictional bridges suddenly turn out to actually exist in real life,” he revealed the moment when he came up with the idea.</p><p>Before the bridges ever became a reality, the Stam carried the idea around in his head for a while. “I made some illustrations of it and that was that. Just another idea. I talked about my projects with someone and I realized that this was a good idea.”</p><p>Stam got in touch with the City Council of Spijkenisse, where he was born and raised.

However, because he didn’t have a background in architecture or engineering, he worked with an entire team of experts to turn his vision into reality.

Meanwhile, the 10 euro bridge represents the Romanesque period. The 20 euro bridge depicts the Gothic period, the 50 euro one is from the Renaissance, the 100 euro bridge represents Baroque and Rococo, and the 200 euro note represents the Age of Iron and Glass architecture. Finally, the 500 euro note depicts modern 20th-century architecture.</p><p>The 7 banknotes picturing Kalina’s drawings came into circulation in the European Union on January 1, 2002. The bridges are a metaphor for the cooperation and communication between European nations and between Europe and the rest of the world.</p>     </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>By Josh Cohen</p><div data-body-id="cp1"><p>A patient of mine named Elliot recently took a week off from his demanding job as a <small>GP</small>. He felt burnt out and badly needed to rest. The plan was to sleep late, read a novel, take the odd leisurely walk, maybe catch up on “Game of Thrones”. But somehow he found himself instead packing his schedule with art museums, concerts, theatre, meetings with friends in hot new bars and restaurants. Then there were the visits to the gym, Spanish lessons, some flat-pack furniture assemblage. </p><p>During the first of his twice-weekly evening sessions, he wondered if he shouldn’t slow down. He felt as exhausted as ever. Facebook and Twitter friends were joking about how it all sounded like harder work than work. “I’m trying to figure out how I’ve managed to be doing so much when I didn’t want to be doing anything. Somehow not doing anything seems impossible. I mean, how can you just…<i>do nothing</i>?!”</p><p>When Elliot protests that he can’t just do nothing, he is seeing and judging himself from the perspective of a culture that looks with disdain at anything that smacks of inactivity. Under constant self-scrutiny as to whether he is being sufficiently productive, he feels ashamed when he judges himself to have come up short in this regard. But this leaves him at once too drained to work and unable to rest.</p><p><a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2016/06/29/minds-turned-to-ash" data-tegid="bt1s3570lq808vu11l1kgpelolmm9b5c">As I describe in my feature for the August/September issue of “1843”</a>, this is the basic predicament of the burnout sufferer: a feeling of exhaustion accompanied by a nervy compulsion to go on regardless is a double bind that makes it very difficult to know how to cope. Burnout involves the loss of the capacity to relax, to “just do nothing”. It prevents an individual from embracing the ordinary pleasures – sleep, long baths, strolling, long lunches, meandering conversation – that induce calm and contentment. It can be counterproductive to recommend relaxing activities to someone who complains that the one thing they cannot do is relax.</p><p>So what does it take to recover the capacity to do nothing, or very little? I might be expected at this point to leap to psychoanalysis as an instant remedy. But psychoanalysis is emotionally demanding, time-consuming and often expensive. Nor does it work for everyone (a basic truth of all therapies, physical or mental). </p><p>In less severe cases of burnout, it is often the case that difficulties inducing nervous exhaustion are more external than internal. Time and energy may be drained by life events (bereavement, divorce, changes in financial status and so on) as well as the demands of work. </p><p>In such cases, it is worth turning in the first instance to more external solutions – cutting working hours as much as possible, carving out more time to relax or for contemplative practices such as yoga and meditation. This is as much a matter of discovering a remedy as the remedy itself. Merely listening and attending to the needs of the inner self as opposed to the demands of the outside world can have a transformative effect. </p><p>But such solutions will seem unrealistic to some sufferers both practically and psychologically. Practically in the sense that many of us are employed in sectors that demand punishing hours and unstinting commitment; psychologically in the sense that reducing working hours, and so taking oneself out of the highest levels of the game, is likely to induce more rather than less anxiety in someone driven relentlessly to achieve more.</p><p>So while there are many means by which we can be helped to relax, the predicament of severe burnout is precisely that you cannot be helped to relax. Where burnout has psychological roots, psychoanalysis may be able to help. </p><p>One way is its “form”. The nervous exhaustion of burnout results from their enslavement to an endless to-do list packed with short- and long-range tasks. In a psychotherapy session, you sit or lie down and begin to talk with no particular agenda, letting yourself go wherever your minds takes you. For portions of a session you might be silent, discovering the value of simply being with someone, without having to justify or account for yourself, instilling an appreciation for what the American psychoanalyst Jonathan Lear calls “mental activity without a purpose.”</p><p>Another way is the “content” of psychoanalysis. Talking to a therapist can help us discover those elements in our own history and character that make us particularly vulnerable to specific difficulties such as burnout. <a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2016/06/29/minds-turned-to-ash" data-tegid="bt1s3570lq808vu11l1kgpelolmm9b5c">In my feature for “1843”</a>, I discuss how two patients came from early childhood to associate their worth and value with their levels of achievement. Under constant pressure from within to “be their best”, they were liable to feel empty and exhausted when, inevitably, they felt they’d failed to live up to this ideal self-image.</p><p>This was very much the case for Elliot, and goes some way to explaining why the idea of “just doing nothing” so scandalised him. Even today, as they approach old age, Elliot could never imagine his parents putting their feet up talking, reading or watching <small>TV</small>. He remembers family meals taken quickly, with one or both parents in a hurry to rush off to one commitment or another. His own life was heavily scheduled with homework and extra-curricular lessons, and he was never more forcefully admonished by either parent than when he was being “lazy”. “They were kind of compulsively active”, he said, “and made me feel it was shameful to waste time. You could imagine the seats of their chairs were rigged to administer a jolt of current if they sat on them for more than ten minutes.” Only now is he beginning to ask why they, and he in turn, are like this, and why being at rest for any length of time is equivalent in their minds to “wasting” it.</p><p>Insight like this can be helpful to challenge our unthinkingly internalised habits of working and our dogmas as to what constitutes a “productive” use of our time. It encourages us to think about what kind of life would be worth living, rather than simply living the life we assume we’re stuck with.</p><p><small>Illustration Izhar Cohen</small></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

	  <h2 itemprop="about">How many different types of garden hoe are there?</h2>
	  <p>Author: <a href="#author">Greg Baka</a></p>
	  <h2>All the hoe shapes, styles, and designs: Simplified</h2>
	  
	  <p> There are a lot of different names, flavors, and descriptions out there. A couple hours of online searching created a list that
	      grew and grew to a total of 48 unique garden hoe names. And that was without including brands, spelling differences, and regional name variations!
	  </p>
	  <p> But when you start to group them by what the hoe is USED FOR, and what the ACTION is to make it work, then there are <u>just 5</u> different categories of garden hoes.</p>
	  <p>Do you know what all 5 are? (Hint - the picture below contains only 3 of the categories)</p>

	  </p>
	  <p> <b>First,</b> let's sort the 48 hoes into 5 categories based on...</p>
      <p> ...what they are most useful for, </p>
	  <p> ...the action used to operate the tool, </p>
	  <p> ...and what soil type they work best in. </p>
	  <p> We will also show you how your old garden hoes can be made more efficient, and how to pick replacements for the hopeless ones in your tool pile.
          There is no such thing as a universal <a href="https://www.easydigging.com/garden-hoes/">garden hoe</a> 
		  - they each only do one or two tasks well. </p>
	  
	  <p><u> Here are all 48 in alphabetical order... </u></p>
      <p><em> Action, American Standard, Circle, Cobra Head, Coleman Hoe, Collinear, Cultivator hoe, 
	      Diamond, Draw, Dutch, Eye hoe, EZ Digger, Field, Floral, Fork, Goose neck, Grape, Grub, Gung-hoe, Half Moon, Heart, Hooke-and-Crooke, 
		  Hula, Korean Ho-Mi, Loop hoe, Onion, Oscillating, Paddle, Pattern, Plow hoe, Pointed, Potato fork, Pull spork, Push, Push-n-Pull, Ridging, 
		  Scovil, Scuffle, Speed, Stirrup, Swage hoe, Swan neck, Swoe, Trapezoid, Upright Hoe, Warren, Winged weeder, and Wire weeder. </em>
	  </p>
	  <p> Whew! That is a confusing jumble. So let's make it simpler and group them into the right category. </p>

	  <h3>Group #1: Digging Hoes<p>Action = Chop<br>Purpose = Digging and Tilling in all soils </p></h3> 
	  <p> The first (and oldest) style are the ones that started way back when agriculture began. 
	      They are used to chop through sod to make a garden space. They are also used to keep that soil tilled up and loose.
	  </p>
	  
	  <div>
	    <div>
	      <p> These tools typically have a heavy blade or tines that chops into the soil at a 45 degree angle. 
		      The handle makes about an 80 degree angle with the blade. 
	          The heavy weight is important because it builds momentum as the tool swings downward,and helps them easily penetrate the soil. 
		      <em>*Note - remember this paragraph because it also explains why part of the "Draw" category below is hard to use.</em> 
	      </p>
	      <p> It is best to chop thin slices of sod or soil (an inch or two) and then pull the handle back towards you to move or till the slice. 
		      (See our 
			  <nobr><a href="https://www.easydigging.com/garden-hoes/articles/how-to-use-grub-hoe.html">How to Use a Grub Hoe</a></nobr> article)
	      </p>
		  <p> Although these tasks can now also be done with a plow or rototiller, these tools are still used here and around the world by 
	      those practicing small-scale agriculture, and by normal gardeners who want to avoid the cost and hassles of gas powered equipment.

	  <h3>Group #2: Draw Hoes<p>Action = Pull / Scrape<br>Purpose = Weeding in hard or soft soil </p></h3> 
	  
	  <p> This group contains the ones that people are most familiar. If you ask someone to sketch a “garden hoe”, this is what you will get. </p>
	  <p> The word "draw" also means "to pull". These tools are used by pulling or drawing them towards you. The blade scrapes at or below the the soil surface.
	      If scraping at the surface, the blade will rip or slice the weed stems. If scraping below the surface, it will uproot the weeds.
	  </p>
	  
	  <div>
	    <div>
	      <p> The hoe head is light - it does not need to be heavy, because this design is not meant for digging deep into the soil. </p>
	      <p> The blade should contact the soil at a 20 to 30 degree angle, which is optimal for scraping. 
	          And the angle between the blade and handle should be about 60 degrees, plus or minus depending on the handle length and your height. 
	    	  <em>And here is where the trouble starts...</em>
	      </p>
	      <p> <strong>The trouble, or problem, with many Draw Hoes is that people do not adjust the neck of the hoe.</strong> 
	          The "neck" is the rod that connects the blade to the handle. 
			  The only reason the neck is there is to allow the user to allow to fine tune the tool so that the end of the handle 
			  is at comfortable level for their height, AND AT THE SAME TIME allow the blade to make the proper angle with the soil.

	  <p> Let's list the types of Draw Hoes, and tell their pros and cons. </p>

	  <div> <!-- standard draw hoes -->
	    <div>
	      <h3> Standard Draw Hoes: </h3>
	      <p> These are the <em>most common hoes</em>. You can find them at every hardware or big-box store in the land...and they are the <b><em>worst ones</em></b>. </p>
		  <p> This is the group that people have the <u>most trouble</u> with, and the ones that create the general impression that 
		      hoeing a garden is really difficult, back-breaking, and time-sucking.
		  </p>
		  <p> They are rarely made with the blades at the right angle, and many are built with such thick necks that they can not be adjusted. 
			  Since the angle is wrong, people often end up hacking at weeds with these hoes, which is what gives hoeing the garden it's bad rap as an exhausting chore.
          </p>

	  <div>
	    <div>		  
          <p> <b>Why is the most commonly available garden hoe also the worst one to use?</b> </p>
          <p> Here is my educated opinion, from being in the garden tool business for 11 years... &nbsp; 
		      The reason is that many decades ago, digging hoes became hard to get, and some tool company beefed up a standard draw hoe in a poor attempt 
              to create a replacement for digging hoes. Look at the drawing, see how the geometry matches?
		  </p>
          <p><u> It does not work for two reasons: </u></p>
		  <p> One, the hoe head does not have enough weight to allow it to chop through hard ground. The weight ratio
              for a digging hoe	head is 1/2 pound per inch. This means that a 4" wide blade needs to weigh 2 pounds, and a 6" wide head needs to weigh 3 pounds.
              Standard draw hoes heads are much lighter than this, so they just bounce off of hard soil.
		  </p>
		  <p> Two, the head-to-handle connection is not strong enough. A real digging hoe has a beefy connection that is designed to withstand the chopping forces.
		      But a draw hoes has a light cone connection, so an hour or two of chopping with it usually results in the head breaking off the handle.

		      <br>BUT -if the neck is too thick to adjust, they are still good for things like pulling loose soil into hills or ridges, 
			  spreading gravel, and mixing concrete.

	    <div>
	      <h3> Light Draw Hoes: </h3>
	      <p> These are much better that the standard models, even though they are called “light”. The reason is that it is much easier to 
		      adjust the angle, because the necks tend to be lighter and longer. Once these are properly adjusted, they quickly and easily 
			  scrape through the top layer of soil to tumble, slice, or uproot the weeds. They are not made for hacking, which could bend the necks.

	  <div> <!-- heavy duty draw hoes -->
	    <div>
	      <h3> Heavy-duty Draw Hoes: </h3>
	      <p> These are the oldest and strongest models. Their blade angle is not meant to be adjustable. So it is important they be designed properly, 
		      and have a long handle to give you options of where to hold it to create the proper angle.
		  </p>
		  <p> These are strong enough to hack through big weeds and grass clumps, but also sharp enough to scrape through the soil to slice and uproot small weeds. 
			  When designed properly, they are very fast aggressive weeders. But they are too big for fine weeding up close to crops, so best used for
			  for paths, rows, and open spaces.

	      <p> <strong> Tined Hoes:</strong> &nbsp; These have either a single or multiple tines, and are pulled through the soil to loosen and till it. 
		      They are good for opening up crusted soil. The single-tine models can be used for weeding in tight spaces between crop plants.
		  </p>
		  <p> <strong> Circle Hoe:</strong> &nbsp; I have never used one, though they have some good reviews. 
		      Not sure how adjustable that blade angle is, your experience will probably be very dependent 
			  on your height and your soil situation.

	  <h2>Group #3: Reciprocating Hoes<p>Action = Back and forth scrubbing motion<br>Purpose = Weeding in medium or soft soil </p></h2> 
	  <p> This group is the only ones with moving parts. 
	      The narrow blade has a pivot that lets it easily skim across the top of the soil on the forward stroke,
		  then scrape and churn through the soil at a shallow angle (20 degrees) as you pull the hoe backward. 
		  The shallow angle will cut smaller weeds and uproot the rest. 
	  </p>
      <p> Heavily built versions can used pretty aggressively for preparing soil or weeding between the rows. 
	      While lighter models are used close to crop plants to weed the uppermost layer of soil without damaging your crop's roots.
	  </p>
	  <p> Most hoes in this category of hoe do not have an adjustable handle angle. 
	      So for those, a proper starting design and a long handle are critical. Try before you buy. 
	      But there is one, called the Switchblade Hoe, that does have a fully adjustable handle and interchangeable heads.

	  <h2>Group #4: Flat Hoes<p>Action = Push and pull<br>Purpose = Weeding in loose or soft soil </p></h2> 
	  <p> I called these "flat" because the blades lay parallel to the soil surface. They are moved back and forth just under the soil surface to cut or uproot small weeds. 
	      They are not meant for hard or baked soil, though you could loosen such soil first with a Tined Draw Hoe and then use a flat hoe to finish it up.
	  </p>
	  <p> These come in almost every geometric shape. The edges are either sharp or saw-toothed. 
	      Beware of claims of "Self-Sharpening" - rubbing a tool around in the dirt never sharpens it.
	  </p>
	  <p> The blade must lay flat on the ground while holding the handle in a comfortable position. 
	      So it is important to pick one that has an adjustable neck.

      <h2>Abstract</h2>
    </header>

  <p>An in vitro model of human ovarian follicles would greatly benefit the study of female reproduction. Ovarian development requires the combination of germ cells and several types of somatic cells. Among these, granulosa cells play a key role in follicle formation and support for oogenesis. Whereas efficient protocols exist for generating human primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs) from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), a method of generating granulosa cells has been elusive. Here, we report that simultaneous overexpression of two transcription factors (TFs) can direct the differentiation of hiPSCs to granulosa-like cells. We elucidate the regulatory effects of several granulosa-related TFs and establish that overexpression of NR5A1 and either RUNX1 or RUNX2 is sufficient to generate granulosa-like cells. Our granulosa-like cells have transcriptomes similar to human fetal ovarian cells and recapitulate key ovarian phenotypes including follicle formation and steroidogenesis. When aggregated with hPGCLCs, our cells form ovary-like organoids (ovaroids) and support hPGCLC development from the premigratory to the gonadal stage as measured by induction of DAZL expression. This model system will provide unique opportunities for studying human ovarian biology and may enable the development of therapies for female reproductive health.</p>

  <div>
      <p>This manuscript addresses a fundamental issue in ovarian biology of deriving granulosa cells from human iPS cells. These findings are important to treat female infertility in the future and may prove valuable in the Ob and Gyn clinical practice. The authors provide compelling evidence by developing and validating their model using in vitro ovaroids. This study provides a novel resource for transcriptomic signatures of ovarian somatic cells derived in vitro.</p>

      <p>Ovaries are responsible for forming the eggs humans and other mammals need to reproduce. Once mature, the egg cell is released into the fallopian tube where it can be potentially fertilized by a sperm. Despite their crucial role, how eggs are made in the ovary is poorly understood. This is because ovaries are hard to access, making it difficult to conduct experiments on them.</p>
<p>To overcome this, researchers have built artificial ovaries in the laboratory using stem cells from the embryos of mice which can develop into all cell types in the adult body. By culturing these embryonic stem cells under special conditions, researchers can convert them in to the two main cell types of the developing ovary: germ cells which go on to form eggs, and granulosa cells which help eggs grow and mature. The resulting lab-grown ovary can make eggs that produce live mice when fertilized.</p>
<p>This approach has also been applied to human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), adult human cells which have been reprogrammed to a stem-like state. While this has produced human germ cells, generating human granulosa cells has been more challenging. Here, Pierson Smela, Kramme et al. show that activating a specific set of transcription factors (proteins that switch genes on or off) in iPSCs can make them transition to granulosa cells.</p>
<p>First, the team tested random combinations of 35 transcription factors which, based on previous literature and genetic data, were likely to play a role in the formation of granulosa cells. This led to the identification of a small number of factors that caused the human iPSCs to develop features and carry out roles seen in mature granulosa cells; this includes producing an important reproductive hormone and supporting the maturation of germ cells. Pierson Smela, Kramme et al. found that growing these granulosa-like cells together with germ cells (also generated via iPSCs) resulted in structures similar to ovarian follicles which help eggs develop.</p>
<p>These findings could help researchers build stable systems for studying how granulosa cells behave in human ovaries. This could lead to new insights about reproductive health.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
    </header>

  <div>
      <p>Oogenesis is the central process of female reproduction, yet less is understood about this process in humans relative to other model organisms. This is in part due to difficulties in obtaining samples of human fetal ovaries, and the lack of a suitable model system to study human ovarian development in vitro. The potential power of such a system is illustrated by a recent study in mice, which differentiated mouse embryonic stem cells into primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs) and ovarian-like cells, and combined these cell types. Reconstituted follicles were capable of producing oocytes and live offspring (<a href="#bib78">Yoshino et al., 2021</a>). Using mouse fetal ovarian somatic cells, a similar system was published that allowed the development of human PGCLCs to the oogonia stage (<a href="#bib74">Yamashiro et al., 2018</a>). However, these mixed-species systems are inadequate for fully modeling human ovarian development. Clearly, the construction of fully human ovarian follicles from pluripotent stem cells could enable new advances in the study of female reproduction, epigenetics, and human development.</p>
<p>Ovarian development requires paracrine and juxtacrine interaction between cells from germline and somatic lineages (<a href="#bib19">Høyer et al., 2005</a>; <a href="#bib1">Albertini et al., 2001</a>; <a href="#bib57">Rodrigues et al., 2021</a>; <a href="#bib64">Su et al., 2004</a>; <a href="#bib31">Le Bouffant et al., 2010</a>; <a href="#bib51">Otsuka and Shimasaki, 2002</a>; <a href="#bib20">Hu et al., 2015</a>). During embryonic development, the first cells committed to the germline appear at roughly 2–3 weeks post-fertilization (wpf), when primordial germ cells (PGCs) are specified from the posterior epiblast in response to bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling (<a href="#bib68">Tang et al., 2016</a>; <a href="#bib30">Lawson et al., 1999</a>; <a href="#bib24">Kee et al., 2006</a>; <a href="#bib18">Hayashi et al., 2011</a>). After specification, PGCs migrate to the developing gonad and undergo further development into oogonia (in female) or spermatogonia (in male) (<a href="#bib56">Richardson and Lehmann, 2010</a>; <a href="#bib14">Grimaldi and Raz, 2020</a>). The expression of the RNA-binding proteins DAZL and DDX4 (also known as VASA) begins in gonadal PGCs (<a href="#bib20">Hu et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#bib2">Anderson et al., 2007</a>; <a href="#bib44">Nicholls et al., 2019</a>), with DAZL identified as a key factor induced by the gonadal environment that commits PGCs to the germline (<a href="#bib44">Nicholls et al., 2019</a>), restricting pluripotency and inhibiting differentiation to somatic lineages (<a href="#bib5">Chen et al., 2014</a>). Notably, gonadal PGCs from Carnegie stage 23 primate embryos express mature markers such as DAZL and DDX4, and can complete spermatogenesis upon transplantation into a recipient testis (<a href="#bib7">Clark et al., 2017</a>), whereas earlier-stage PGCLCs cannot (<a href="#bib62">Sosa et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p>Previous studies have provided efficient protocols for the differentiation of hiPSCs to DAZL-negative premigratory PGCLCs (<a href="#bib22">Irie et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#bib58">Sasaki et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#bib39">Mitsunaga et al., 2017</a>; <a href="#bib61">Sebastiano et al., 2021</a>; <a href="#bib24">Kee et al., 2006</a>). However, the only previously reported method that allows human primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs) to develop to later DAZL-positive stages in vitro is to aggregate them with mouse fetal ovarian (<a href="#bib74">Yamashiro et al., 2018</a>) or testicular (<a href="#bib21">Hwang et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib25">Kobayashi et al., 2022</a>) cells, which mimic the environment of the early gonad. Another study tested aggregation of hPGCLCs with rat neonatal testis cells (<a href="#bib36">Mall et al., 2020</a>), but only showed that the hPGCLCs could survive and did not assess maturation.</p>
<p>The somatic cells of the developing ovary provide crucial support for oogenesis. These cells originate from the WT1<i>-</i>positive intermediate mesoderm (<a href="#bib59">Sasaki et al., 2021</a>; <a href="#bib63">Stévant et al., 2019</a>), and initially exist in a bipotential state, capable of supporting either male or female development. In humans, sex-specific pathways begin to diverge at around 7 wpf (<a href="#bib17">Hartshorne et al., 2009</a>). In male mammals, the Y-chromosomal transcription factor (TF) SRY activates a gene regulatory network promoting testis formation and repressing ovary formation (<a href="#bib26">Koopman et al., 1991</a>). In the absence of SRY, the TF FOXL2 represses the testis factors, allowing ovarian development to proceed (<a href="#bib45">Nicol et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib52">Ottolenghi et al., 2005</a>). The ovarian somatic cells further differentiate into several lineages, including the granulosa cells which surround and support developing oocytes. Proper oogenesis depends on a complex interplay of paracrine signaling between somatic and germline cells (<a href="#bib64">Su et al., 2004</a>; <a href="#bib31">Le Bouffant et al., 2010</a>; <a href="#bib51">Otsuka and Shimasaki, 2002</a>; <a href="#bib53">Peng et al., 2013</a>). Granulosa cells additionally participate in endocrine signaling, producing estradiol and progesterone which regulate diverse reproductive functions (<a href="#bib10">Findlay et al., 2019</a>).</p>
<p>Although a few studies have attempted differentiating human pluripotent stem cells to granulosa-like cells through treatment with recombinant signaling proteins, none has resulted in an efficient method, nor has any previous study evaluated their ability to support germ cell development. For example, a study using spontaneous differentiation of hiPSCs produced a small fraction of AMHR2-positive granulosa-like cells which expressed some granulosa marker genes and produced estradiol (<a href="#bib35">Lipskind et al., 2018</a>). However, the efficiency of this spontaneous differentiation was low and not numerically reported. A related study used recombinant signaling proteins in a 12-day multistep protocol to direct the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) toward granulosa-like cells (<a href="#bib29">Lan et al., 2013</a>); again, the yield was low (12–36%), and although the cells upregulated some marker genes, the expression levels were much lower than observed in primary granulosa cells.</p>
<p>Manipulation of TFs allows reprogramming of cell identity and offers a rapid and efficient way to generate granulosa-like cells. Perhaps the best-known example of cellular reprogramming using TFs is the generation of iPSCs from somatic cells (<a href="#bib66">Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006</a>). TF expression can also guide the differentiation of iPSCs into various somatic lineages, including neurons, fibroblasts, oligodendrocytes, and vascular endothelium (<a href="#bib43">Ng et al., 2021</a>). Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated that overexpression of the TFs NR5A1 and GATA4 is sufficient to reprogram human fibroblasts into Sertoli-like cells (<a href="#bib34">Liang et al., 2019</a>), the male developmental counterparts of granulosa-like cells. Therefore, we set out to determine a set of TFs that could be used for an efficient, scalable method of generating granulosa-like cells from hiPSCs. Our overall experimental workflow is shown in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>.</p>

                <p>First, barcoded transcription factor (TF) expression vectors were integrated into FOXL2-T2A-tdTomato reporter human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). After induction of TF expression, cells positive for tdTomato and granulosa-related surface markers were sorted, and the barcodes were sequenced. The top TFs based on barcode enrichment were selected for further characterization by combinatorial screening and bulk RNA-seq. Next, monoclonal hiPSC lines were generated that inducibly express the top TFs (see <a href="#fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</a>) and generate granulosa-like cells with high efficiency (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83291/figures#fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</a>). Granulosa-like cells from these lines were further evaluated for estradiol production in response to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Finally, they were aggregated with human primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs) to form ovaroids. These ovaroids produced estradiol and progesterone, formed follicle-like structures, and supported hPGCLC maturation as measured by immunofluorescence microscopy and scRNA-seq.</p>

      <h3>In silico prediction of granulosa cell-regulating TFs</h3>
    </header>

  <p>We began by predicting candidate TFs that could direct the differentiation of hiPSCs to granulosa-like cells. We first selected 21 TFs that were differentially expressed in granulosa cells compared to hESCs and early mesoderm, using previously published datasets for these cell types (<a href="#bib22">Irie et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#bib80">Zhang et al., 2018</a>). We also included five TFs based on previous developmental biology studies, mainly showing that these TFs were important for mouse ovarian development (<a href="#bib37">Manuylov et al., 2008</a>; <a href="#bib48">Niu and Spradling, 2020</a>; <a href="#bib71">Voronina et al., 2007</a>; <a href="#bib55">Richards, 2001</a>; <a href="#bib46">Nicol et al., 2019</a>). Finally, we identified nine additional TFs that we predicted to be upstream of the others on the list, based on a gene regulatory network analysis taking into account co-expression data as well as binding motifs (<a href="#bib27">Kramme et al., 2021a</a>). The list of TFs (35 in total) is in <a href="#fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</a>. Next, we assembled a PiggyBac library by cloning cDNAs into a barcoded destination plasmid (<a href="#bib28">Kramme et al., 2021b</a>). The TFs were expressed under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter, which we characterized in previous work (<a href="#bib27">Kramme et al., 2021a</a>).</p>

      <h3>Overexpression screening identifies TFs that drive granulosa-like cell formation</h3>
    </header>

  <div>
      <p>To enable identification of granulosa-like cells, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology-directed repair to engineer an hiPSC line with a homozygous knock-in of a T2A-tdTomato reporter at the C-terminus of FOXL2 (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83291/figures#fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</a>). We chose FOXL2 due to its specific expression in granulosa cells (<a href="#bib52">Ottolenghi et al., 2005</a>; <a href="#bib8">Cocquet et al., 2002</a>). Next, the pooled cDNA library was co-electroporated with a PiggyBac transposase expression plasmid, and a population of cells with integrated transposons was selected by treatment with puromycin. In these experiments, we tested several different library compositions and DNA concentrations (see Methods, <a href="#fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</a>, and <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83291/figures#fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</a>).</p>
<p>For screening, we induced TF expression with doxycycline, and sorted reporter-positive cells after 5 days of treatment. In addition to screening TF expression in the pluripotency-supporting mTeSR Plus medium, we also expressed TFs following differentiation of hiPSCs to early-stage mesoderm by treatment with the GSK3 inhibitor CHIR99021. The TF expression resulted in a small fraction of FOXL2+ cells, from which we extracted gDNA and sequenced barcodes. In both conditions, we observed barcodes for <i>NR5A1</i> to be strongly enriched in FOXL2+ cells relative to negative cells, as well as relative to the barcodes in the pre-induced hiPSC population (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2A</a>). Other TFs showed more modest barcode enrichment (<i>RUNX2</i>, <i>GATA4</i>, and <i>TCF21</i>), or enrichment in only one condition (<i>KLF2</i> and <i>NR2F2</i>). Interestingly, barcodes for <i>FOXL2</i> were strongly depleted (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2A</a>), suggesting negative feedback whereby exogenous FOXL2 directly or indirectly suppresses the expression of the endogenous FOXL2 reporter allele.</p>

                  <h6>Identification of transcription factors (TFs) whose overexpression generates granulosa-like cells.</h6>
                
                
                <p>(<b>A</b>) Pooled screening of barcoded TF cDNA libraries (see Methods for details) identifies TFs enriched in FOXL2-T2A-tdTomato+ cells. Library #1 is the full library of 35 TFs, and library #2 is a library containing a subset of 18 TFs. Empty values correspond to TFs that were absent in library #2. (<b>B</b>) Combinatorial screening identifies minimal TF combinations for inducing granulosa-like cells. TF combinations were integrated into human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs); a ‘1’ in the left-hand box signifies the presence of the TF in the combination corresponding to that row. For each combination, the polyclonal hiPSC population was differentiated with TF induction (see Methods). For the last 24 hr of differentiation, cells were additionally treated with FSH and androstenedione. Estradiol production and granulosa markers were measured by ELISA and flow cytometry after a total of 5 days. NR5A1 expression induced high levels of estradiol synthesis, but the combination of NR5A1 with RUNX1 or RUNX2 was required to give the best results for granulosa markers. ‘All markers’ signifies FOXL2+CD82+AMHR2+EPCAM−.</p>

    </div>
<p>Using the top TFs identified in barcode screening (<i>NR5A1</i>, <i>RUNX1/RUNX2</i>, <i>TCF21</i>, and <i>GATA4</i>) we then further optimized the conditions for generation of FOXL2+ cells. We included <i>RUNX1</i> in this list along with <i>RUNX2</i> because the two TFs are structurally and functionally similar, and <i>RUNX1</i> is known to play an important role for granulosa cell maintenance in the mouse (<a href="#bib46">Nicol et al., 2019</a>). We integrated these TFs into hiPSCs and established monoclonal lines, which we screened by flow cytometry after TF induction. We monitored FOXL2-tdTomato as well as the surface markers CD82, follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), and EpCAM. CD82 is absent in hiPSCs, but highly expressed in granulosa cells beginning at the primordial follicle stage (<a href="#bib80">Zhang et al., 2018</a>). FSHR is specific for late-stage (secondary/antral) granulosa cells and Sertoli cells (the male equivalent). By contrast, EpCAM is expressed in hiPSCs and epithelial cells, but not granulosa cells (<a href="#bib80">Zhang et al., 2018</a>).</p>
<p>Out of 23 lines tested, 4 showed &gt;50% FOXL2-tdTomato+CD82+EpCAM− cells after 5 days of differentiation (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83291/figures#fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</a>). We observed low levels of FSHR expression, suggesting that we were mainly generating cells corresponding to early (primordial/primary follicle) granulosa cells, given that FSHR only becomes strongly expressed at later stages of ovarian follicle development (<a href="#bib49">Oktay et al., 1997</a>). Further optimization by adding the GSK3 inhibitor CHIR99021 for the first 2 days (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83291/figures#supp2">Supplementary file 2</a>) resulted in a near-homogeneous FOXL2-tdTomato+CD82+EPCAM− population for the top cell lines (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83291/figures#fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</a>), with this effect being doxycycline responsive. Genotyping of two top lines (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83291/figures#fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</a>) revealed that both had <i>NR5A1</i> expression cassettes integrated, with the first line also having <i>RUNX1</i> and the second line <i>RUNX2</i>.</p>
<p>Subsequently, we set out to determine which TFs were sufficient for induction of granulosa-like cells. We tested combinations of hit TFs from our screening (<i>NR5A1</i>, <i>RUNX2</i>, <i>TCF21</i>, <i>GATA4</i>, <i>KLF2</i>, and <i>NR2F2</i>) as well as TFs reported to be important for ovarian function (<i>RUNX1</i>, <i>WT1</i> [−KTS isoform], and <i>FOXL2</i>). We tested expression of each TF individually, as well as combinations of other TFs and our top hit <i>NR5A1</i>. In addition to flow cytometry, we also measured production of estradiol after treatment of the cells with FSH and androstenedione. We observed that combinations containing <i>NR5A1</i> and <i>RUNX1</i> or <i>RUNX2</i> upregulated FOXL2-tdTomato expression, as well as granulosa surface markers AMHR2 and CD82 (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2B</a>). Estradiol production was strongly induced by <i>NR5A1</i>, and weakly by <i>GATA4</i> and <i>KLF2. RUNX1</i> and <i>RUNX2</i> expression somewhat decreased estradiol production, suggesting a regulatory role of these factors. Overall, these results indicate that <i>NR5A1</i> and either <i>RUNX1</i> or <i>RUNX2</i> are sufficient to induce a granulosa-like phenotype.</p>

      <h3>TF-mediated differentiation drives granulosa-like cell formation based on gene expression signatures</h3>

  <div>
      <p>We next examined the gene expression of our granulosa-like cells. We compared the bulk transcriptomes of hiPSCs, COV434 and KGN ovarian tumor cells, and sorted FOXL2+CD82+ granulosa-like cells from day 5 of a polyclonal differentiation with expression of our previously identified top TFs (NR5A1, TCF21, GATA4, and RUNX1; see <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>). As an additional control, we included hiPSCs differentiated under the same conditions but without TF induction.</p>
<p>In the absence of TF expression, the hiPSCs differentiated into cells expressing mesoderm markers (full gene expression data are provided in the Source Data for <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>). At day 5 of differentiation, we observed strong upregulation relative to hiPSCs of genes associated with both lateral mesoderm (<i>HAND1</i> and <i>BMP5</i>) as well as paraxial mesoderm (<i>PAX3</i>), which potentially indicates the presence of a heterogeneous population. Upregulated genes were enriched for gene ontology terms related to heart, blood vessel, muscle, and skeletal development (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83291/figures#supp3">Supplementary file 3</a>).</p>

<p>With TF induction, we observed expression of bipotential gonad and granulosa markers, notably including <i>AMHR2</i>, <i>CD82</i>, <i>FOXL2</i>, <i>FSHR</i>, <i>IGFBP7</i>, <i>KRT19</i>, <i>STAR</i>, and <i>WNT4</i> (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3A</a>). The ovarian stromal/theca cell marker <i>NR2F2</i> was also upregulated. The expression levels (transcripts per million (TPM)) were generally comparable to those observed in previously published data from granulosa cells and human fetal gonad (<a href="#bib80">Zhang et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib65">Sybirna et al., 2020</a>). The only major exception was <i>WT1,</i> which had much weaker expression than in vivo (although still greater than hiPSCs and KGN cells). We also examined the expression of pluripotent and adrenal markers to check for incomplete or off-target differentiation. We did not observe adrenal marker expression, although we did note some residual <i>POU5F1</i> (encoding the OCT4 protein) expression that may indicate that our polyclonal population did not fully differentiate. COV434 cells, which were commonly considered as granulosa-like cells but recently reclassified as small cell ovarian carcinoma (<a href="#bib54">Price et al., 2012</a>; <a href="#bib79">Zhang et al., 2000</a>; <a href="#bib23">Karnezis et al., 2021</a>), did not express most granulosa markers, but did express high levels of <i>WT1</i> and <i>NR2F2</i>. By contrast, KGN cells expressed high levels of most granulosa markers, but not <i>WT1</i>.</p>
<p>We also performed a transcriptome-wide comparison of our TF-induced granulosa-like cells with three published datasets spanning weeks 6–21 of human fetal ovarian development (<a href="#bib67">Tang et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#bib32">Lecluze et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib77">Yatsenko et al., 2019</a>). Tang et al. sequenced RNA from male and female gonadal somatic cells at gestational week 7, whereas Yatsenko et al. and Leclucze et al. sequenced RNA from whole fetal ovaries over a range of gestational weeks. Using the transcriptome overlap measure (TROM) (<a href="#bib33">Li et al., 2017</a>), we computed similarity scores between our samples and these datasets (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3B</a>). We found a high degree of similarity (−log<sub>10</sub>(p<sub>adj</sub>) = 50.5) between our granulosa-like cells and human fetal ovaries. The closest match was with gestational week 12 whole fetal ovary from the Leclucze et al. dataset (which sequenced RNA from whole ovaries at different gestational weeks) but we also observed a significant similarity (−log<sub>10</sub>(p<sub>adj</sub>) of 12.7–15.8) with the other two datasets we examined. By contrast, COV434 and KGN cells showed a more modest similarity to the fetal ovary, and hiPSCs showed none at all.</p>
<p>To further elucidate the regulatory effects of individual TFs that we identified as granulosa related (FOXL2, WT1, NR5A1, GATA4, TCF21, and RUNX1), we integrated their cDNA plasmids into hiPSCs and induced expression with doxycycline. For these experiments, we harvested RNA after 2 days of TF expression, since we were interested in short-term effects. We performed differential gene expression analysis relative to hiPSCs, and examined regulatory effects among TFs, and between TFs and marker genes (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3C</a>). Overall, we observed that FOXL2, NR5A1, GATA4, and RUNX1 had the greatest effects on granulosa marker genes. Therefore, we generated additional hiPSC lines by integrating these TFs (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83291/figures#fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</a>). To rule out any effects of the T2A-tdTomato reporter allele potentially perturbing FOXL2 function, we generated these in a wild-type background (F66 hiPSC line). We measured surface marker expression by flow cytometry after induction, confirmed expression of the granulosa marker <i>AMHR2</i> by qPCR, and additionally measured estradiol production in the presence of FSH and androstenedione (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83291/figures#fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</a>). We selected the clones (<a href="#fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</a>) that showed the most robust overall phenotype based on a combination of surface markers, <i>AMHR2</i>, expression and estradiol production.</p>
<p>In the differential expression analysis, we additionally found that GATA4 upregulated <i>NR2F2</i>, a marker of ovarian stromal and theca cells (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3C, G</a>). <i>LGR5</i>, previously reported as a marker of pre-granulosa cells (<a href="#bib48">Niu and Spradling, 2020</a>), was upregulated by GATA4 and RUNX1 (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3C, F, G</a>). We also confirmed a previous report that FOXL2 expression upregulated the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor <i>CDKN1B</i> (<a href="#bib15">Gustin et al., 2016</a>)<i>,</i> as well as downregulating <i>ORC1</i> and <i>MYC</i> (Source Data for <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>), suggesting suppression of cellular proliferation.</p>
<p>Finally, we conducted a gene ontology enrichment analysis of upregulated and downregulated genes for each TF (<a href="#bib38">Mi et al., 2021</a>). Significantly enriched terms were mainly related to generic developmental processes (e.g., ‘tissue development’, see <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83291/figures#supp3">Supplementary file 3</a>) although terms related to gonad development were also significantly enriched for NR5A1 upregulated genes.</p>

      <h3>Granulosa-like cells respond to FSH and perform steroidogenesis</h3>
    </header>

  <div>
      <p>We next validated the ability of our granulosa-like cells to carry out one of the key endocrine functions of granulosa cells: the production of estradiol. In the ovary, theca cells convert cholesterol to androstenedione, which is the substrate for estradiol production in granulosa cells. The rate-limiting step is oxidative decarboxylation by CYP19A1 (aromatase), producing estrone, which is subsequently reduced to estradiol by enzymes in the HSD17B family, typically HSD17B1 in granulosa cells (<a href="#bib16">Hakkarainen et al., 2015</a>). In vivo, this pathway of estrogen synthesis is stimulated by FSH (<a href="#bib60">Sasson et al., 2004</a>; <a href="#bib72">Welsh et al., 1984</a>).</p>
<p>We treated our granulosa-like cells with androstenedione, in the presence or absence of FSH or forskolin (which directly increases levels of the FSHR second messenger cAMP). As controls, we used COV434 and KGN ovarian tumor cells, which were previously reported to produce estradiol from androstenedione (<a href="#bib54">Price et al., 2012</a>; <a href="#bib79">Zhang et al., 2000</a>; <a href="#bib47">Nishi et al., 2001</a>), as well as immortalized primary human granulosa cells (HGL5) and primary adult mouse ovarian somatic cells. Our granulosa-like cells produced estradiol from androstenedione, and in seven out of the nine monoclonal lines we tested, this steroidogenic activity significantly increased upon stimulation with FSH or forskolin (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4A</a>, see Source Data for statistical tests). One of our granulosa lines (F3/N.T #5) produced high levels of estradiol in all conditions, and this line, unlike the others, had neither <i>RUNX1</i> nor <i>RUNX2</i> expression vectors integrated (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83291/figures#fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</a>).</p>

                <p>(<b>A</b>) Granulosa-like cells produce estradiol in the presence of androstenedione and either FSH or forskolin (FK). Results are shown from nine monoclonal populations (see <a href="#fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</a>) of granulosa-like cells (<i>n</i> = 2 biological replicates for each of 9 clones, error bars are 95% CI), as well as the COV434 and KGN human ovarian cancer cell lines, HGL5 immortalized primary human granulosa cells, and primary adult mouse granulosa cells. Asterisks mark lines where FSH production significantly (two-tailed <i>t</i>-test, p &lt; 0.05) increased upon stimulation. Exact p values are given in the Source Data. (<b>B</b>) Ovaroids produce both estradiol and progesterone. Estradiol production requires androstenedione and is stimulated by FSH. Results are shown for ovaroids formed with six different monoclonal samples of granulosa-like cells (<i>n</i> = 1 sample per ovaroid per condition), at 3 days post-aggregation.</p>

<p>The levels of estradiol produced by our three FSH-responsive lines were similar to those produced by KGN human granulosa tumor cells, which also showed responses to FSH and forskolin (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4A</a>). In contrast, COV434 cells, which showed no <i>FSHR</i> expression in our RNA-seq data (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3A</a>), were unresponsive to FSH alone, producing estradiol only in the presence of forskolin. HGL5 immortalized human granulosa cells did not produce estradiol under any condition. Primary adult mouse ovarian somatic cells produced similar amounts of estradiol to our hiPSC-derived granulosa-like cells (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4A</a>). However, the mouse cells did not show a response to FSH or forskolin, possibly because they were already exposed to FSH in vivo.</p>
<p>We also investigated whether our granulosa-like cells maintained their steroidogenic activity during ovaroid (ovarian organoid) co-culture with hPGCLCs (see below). We measured hormone levels in ovaroid supernatants in the presence or absence of androstenedione and FSH. In addition to estradiol, we also measured progesterone, which granulosa cells produce in vivo after ovulation and formation of the corpus luteum. We observed production of both hormones in five out of six samples (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4B</a>). Estradiol was produced only in the presence of androstenedione supplementation, and levels increased with FSH treatment. Progesterone was produced in all conditions but was highest in the absence of androstenedione.</p>

      <h3>Granulosa-like cells support germ cell development within ovaroids</h3>
    </header>

  <div>
      <p>Current methods for inducing and culturing hPGCLCs produce cells corresponding to immature, premigratory PGCs that lack expression of gonadal PGC markers such as DAZL (<a href="#bib22">Irie et al., 2015</a>). During fetal development, PGCs mature through interactions with gonadal somatic cells, with DAZL playing a key role in downregulation of pluripotency factors and commitment to gametogenesis (<a href="#bib44">Nicholls et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib5">Chen et al., 2014</a>). This process has recently been recreated in vitro using mouse fetal ovarian somatic cells (<a href="#bib74">Yamashiro et al., 2018</a>), which allowed the development of hPGCLCs to the oogonia-like stage. We hypothesized that in vitro-derived human granulosa-like cells could perform a similar role, with the potential for eliminating interspecies developmental mismatches. Therefore, we combined our granulosa-like cells with hPGCLCs to form ovarian organoids, which we termed ovaroids.</p>
<p>To generate ovaroids, we aggregated these two cell types in low-binding U-bottom wells, followed by transfer to air–liquid interface Transwell culture. As a comparison, we followed a previously described protocol (<a href="#bib75">Yamashiro et al., 2020</a>) to isolate fetal mouse ovarian somatic cells and aggregate them with hPGCLCs. By immunofluorescence, we observed expression of the mature marker DAZL beginning in a subset of OCT4 + hPGCLCs at 4 days of co-culture with hiPSC-derived granulosa-like cells (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5A</a>). In contrast, robust DAZL expression in co-culture with mouse cells was not observed until day 32 (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5B</a>), with fainter expression visible at day 26 (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83291/figures#supp4">Supplementary file 4</a>). Similarly, in a previous study using the same hPGCLC line and anti-DAZL antibody, DAZL expression was observed only after 77 days of co-culture with mouse fetal testis somatic cells (<a href="#bib25">Kobayashi et al., 2022</a>).</p>

(<b>D</b>) Human ovaroid (F66/N.R2 #1 granulosa-like cells + hPGCLCs) sections at days 4 and 8 of culture, stained for SOX17 (germ cell), TFAP2C (early germ cell), and AMHR2 (granulosa).</p>

<p>The fraction of DAZL+ cells reached its maximum at day 14 in human ovaroids and day 38 in mouse ovaroids (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5C</a>). In human ovaroids, the fraction of OCT4+ cells declined after day 8. In mouse ovaroids, the fraction of OCT4+ cells also declined over time. At day 16 in human ovaroids, DAZL+OCT4− cells were also apparent (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83291/figures#fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</a>) in addition to DAZL+OCT4+ cells, and past day 38 there were more DAZL+ cells than OCT4+ cells in total (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5C</a>). The downregulation of OCT4 in DAZL+ oogonia occurs in vivo during the second trimester of human fetal ovarian development (<a href="#bib2">Anderson et al., 2007</a>); however, we did not observe the transition of DAZL to exclusively cytoplasmic localization that was reported to take place at this stage. Expression of TFAP2C, an early-stage PGC marker, declined during ovaroid culture (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5D</a>) and was almost entirely absent by day 8. By contrast, SOX17 expression was still visible on day 8, and OCT4 and DAZL expression continued to day 54 (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5A, C</a>).</p>
<p>Although this system allowed the rapid development of hPGCLCs to the gonadal stage, the number of germ cells in both hiPSC- and mouse-derived ovaroids declined over prolonged culture (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5C</a>), indicating that either they were dying or differentiating to other lineages. Unlike mouse-derived ovaroids, the hiPSC-derived ovaroids cultured on Transwells gradually flattened and widened, and by day 38 were largely collapsed.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, in these longer-term experiments, we observed the formation of empty follicle-like structures composed of cuboidal AMHR2+FOXL2+ granulosa-like cells (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6A</a>), suggesting that the TFs could drive folliculogenesis even in the absence of oocytes. Follicle-like structure formation was first visible at day 16 (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83291/figures#fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</a>), and at day 26 the largest of these structures had grown to 1–2 mm diameter (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6B</a>). At day 70, ovaroids had developed follicles of a variety of sizes, mainly small single-layer follicles (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6C</a>) but also including antral follicles (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6D</a>). Cells outside of the follicles stained positive for NR2F2 (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6C, D</a>), a marker of ovarian stromal and theca cells.</p>

<p>To further examine the gene expression of hPGCLCs and somatic cells in this system, we performed scRNA-seq on dissociated ovaroids at days 2, 4, 8, and 14 of culture, and clustered cells according to gene expression. As expected, the largest cluster (cluster 0) contained cells expressing granulosa markers such as <i>FOXL2</i>, <i>WNT4</i>, and <i>CD82</i> (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7A, B</a>). Cells expressing markers of secondary/antral granulosa cells such as <i>FSHR</i> and <i>CYP19A1</i> were also found within this cluster, although these were much less numerous. A smaller cluster (cluster 1) expressing the ovarian stromal marker <i>NR2F2</i> was also present. <i>NR2F2</i> is expressed by both stromal and theca cells, but the cells in cluster 1 did not express 17α-hydroxylase (<i>CYP17A1</i>), indicating that they could not produce androgens and were not theca cells. Full expression data for each cluster are given in <a href="#fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</a>.</p>

<p>We also observed a cluster of hPGCLCs expressing marker genes such as <i>CD38</i>, <i>KIT</i>, <i>PRDM1</i>, <i>TFAP2C</i>, <i>PRDM14</i>, <i>NANOG</i>, and <i>POU5F1</i>. Notably, X-chromosomal lncRNAs <i>XIST</i>, <i>TSIX</i>, and <i>XACT</i> were all more highly expressed (an average of ~80-, ~20-, and ~2900-fold, respectively) in the hPGCLCs relative to other clusters (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7B</a>), suggesting that the hPGCLCs were starting the process of X-reactivation (<a href="#bib70">Vallot et al., 2017</a>), which in hPGCs is associated with high expression of both <i>XIST</i> and <i>XACT</i> (<a href="#bib6">Chitiashvili et al., 2020</a>). The X-chromosomal <i>HPRT1</i> gene, known to be more highly expressed in cells with two active X chromosomes (<a href="#bib9">Epstein, 1972</a>), was also ~3-fold upregulated (<a href="#fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</a>).</p>
<p>We next compared our in vitro-generated ovaroids to a reference atlas of human fetal ovarian development (<a href="#bib11">Garcia-Alonso et al., 2022</a>). We used scanpy ingest (<a href="#bib73">Wolf et al., 2018</a>) to integrate our samples into the atlas and annotate each cell with the closest cell type from the in vivo data (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7C</a>). The ovaroids consisted mainly of granulosa, gonadal mesenchyme, and pre-granulosa lineages (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7D</a>), with a small fraction of coelomic epithelium. The fraction of granulosa cells increased from day 2 through day 8, potentially representing a maturation of the somatic cell population. As expected, neural, immune, smooth muscle, and erythroid cells, which were present in fetal ovaries, were completely absent from our ovaroids. Epithelial, endothelial, and perivascular cells were detected, but at very low frequency (1% or less), possibly representing a low rate of off-target differentiation.</p>
<p>We additionally examined the overall fraction of germ cells, as well as the fraction of cells expressing the gonadal germ cell markers <i>DAZL</i> and <i>DDX4</i>, over the course of our experiment (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7D</a>). We defined the germ cell population based on the fetal ovary atlas integration. This population increased from days 2 to 4, but declined thereafter. In comparison, the fraction of <i>DAZL+</i> and <i>DDX4+</i> cells also increased from days 2 to 4, but remained roughly constant from days 4 to 14 (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7D</a>). We performed a differential gene expression analysis and gene ontology enrichment on <i>DAZL+</i> cells relative to <i>DAZL−</i> cells. Upregulated genes (log<sub>2</sub>fc &gt;2, <i>n</i> = 221) were most highly enriched for terms related to generic developmental processes but also included terms related to adhesion and migration (e.g., ‘ameboidal-type cell migration’), as well as reproductive system development. Downregulated genes (log<sub>2</sub>fc &lt;−2, <i>n</i> = 6451) were strongly related to metabolic processes and mitotic cell division. Full data on differentially expressed genes and ontology enrichment are provided in <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83291/figures#supp4">Supplementary file 4</a>. These data suggest that DAZL+ cells in our ovaroids are downregulating their metabolism and proliferation, in agreement with the known role of DAZL in suppressing PGC proliferation (<a href="#bib76">Yan et al., 2022</a>; <a href="#bib12">Gill et al., 2011</a>).</p>

  <div>
      <p>This work establishes a rapid (5 days) and efficient (&gt;70% in top monoclonal lines) method to produce granulosa-like cells by TF-mediated differentiation of hiPSCs. These granulosa-like cells express granulosa marker genes and have highly similar transcriptomes to the human fetal ovary, both by bulk RNA-seq (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>) and scRNA-seq (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>). We demonstrate that our system can model several key ovarian phenotypes, including hormonal signaling, germ cell maturation, and follicle formation. Additionally, we characterize the regulatory effects of granulosa-related TFs and determine that co-expression of NR5A1 and RUNX1 or RUNX2 is minimally sufficient to generate granulosa-like cells from hiPSCs (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2B</a>). We show that FOXL2 and GATA4 may help to further stabilize the granulosa-like transcriptome (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3C</a>), and these TFs were also included in some of our top-performing lines (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83291/figures#fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</a>, <a href="#fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</a>). Finally, our ovaroids formed from granulosa-like cells and hPGCLCs are notable as the first reported fully human ovarian organoids.</p>
<p>Our human ovaroids allow the rapid development of hPGCLCs to the gonadal stage as measured by expression of the markers <i>DAZL</i> and <i>DDX4</i> (<a href="#fig5">Figures 5</a> and <a href="#fig7">7</a>), which was previously only achieved by extended culture with mouse fetal gonadal somatic cells (<a href="#bib74">Yamashiro et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib21">Hwang et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bib42">Murase et al., 2020</a>). As <i>DAZL</i> and <i>DDX4</i> are not expressed in pre-gonadal germ cells and only become expressed after germ cells colonize the gonads (<a href="#bib74">Yamashiro et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib44">Nicholls et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib25">Kobayashi et al., 2022</a>), this implies that our hiPSC-derived granulosa-like cells are able to simulate the gonadal niche and allow germ cell maturation. In a direct comparison with the previous method (<a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>), we show that DAZL expression occurs earlier when hPGCLCs are co-cultured with hiPSC-derived granulosa-like cells instead of mouse fetal ovarian somatic cells.</p>
<p>While our results represent a step forward for the in vitro study of granulosa cells and germ cell development, future research will be necessary to construct a full model of the human ovary. Although we can efficiently generate granulosa-like cells and form ovaroids in combination with germ cells, improved methods will be required for maintaining these ovaroids in culture and preventing the loss of DAZL+ germ cells. Recent optimizations in media and culture methods for re-aggregated human fetal ovarian cells (<a href="#bib40">Mizuta et al., 2022</a>), which were specifically developed to avoid the ‘flattening’ issue with Transwell cultures, may be applicable to our system and allow for more extended development. Our results were also similar to a previous study in which rhesus PGCLCs gained expression of the mature marker DDX4 upon transplantation into an adult testis, but did not complete spermatogenesis (<a href="#bib62">Sosa et al., 2018</a>). A better developmental match (using later-stage germ cells or earlier-stage gonadal somatic cells) may provide better results.</p>
<p>Additionally, the ovary consists of more cell types than merely germ cells and granulosa cells (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7C</a>), and these other cells are also functionally important. For example, our ovaroids produced estradiol only in the presence of androstenedione, which is normally produced by ovarian theca cells. Although our granulosa-like cells were capable of a limited amount of differentiation into NR2F2+ ovarian stromal cells (<a href="#fig6">Figures 6</a> and <a href="#fig7">7</a>), these were not functional theca cells. Thus, developing a method to generate theca cells (or earlier-stage gonadal cells that differentiate into both granulosa and theca cells) will provide a more complete model of ovarian biology. We anticipate that our overall approach of identifying TFs to drive the differentiation of hiPSCs will be broadly applicable to generate these cell types of interest, as well as many others.</p>
<p>One further limitation is the random integration of our transposon-based TF expression vectors. This necessitated generating and testing several clonal hiPSC lines before selecting ones that performed well (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83291/figures#fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</a> and <a href="#fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</a>). Additionally, due to the challenge of growing large numbers of hPGCLCs, we only performed our ovaroid experiments using granulosa-like cells from a limited number of lines (six for hormone assays, two for immunofluorescence, and one for scRNA-seq). We selected the lines for these endpoints based on an assessment of their surface marker expression and estradiol production, as well as preliminary aggregation experiments in which they showed follicle-like morphology. In future studies, we hope to better characterize the relative dosage requirements for our TFs and generate hiPSC lines with controlled TF expression from a known integration site in a safe-harbor locus, or from non-integrating episomal vectors. This should provide a more reproducible way to generate high-performing lines.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, our system has several advantages in comparison with existing in vitro models of the human ovary. Several studies have used mouse fetal gonad cells to support hPGCLC development (<a href="#bib74">Yamashiro et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib25">Kobayashi et al., 2022</a>), but this process is much slower (32 vs. 4 days, <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>), the mouse cells may not behave the same as human cells, and mouse fetal gonad cells are difficult to obtain in large quantities. Other studies have used cancer cell lines such as COV434 or KGN to study various aspects of granulosa cells (<a href="#bib54">Price et al., 2012</a>; <a href="#bib79">Zhang et al., 2000</a>; <a href="#bib47">Nishi et al., 2001</a>). However, these cancer cells may be phenotypically aberrant. In particular, we show that unlike KGN cells or our iPSC-derived granulosa-like cells, COV434 cells do not express granulosa marker genes and do not respond to FSH. This is in agreement with a recent study reporting that the COV434 cell line was mis-identified and actually originates from small cell carcinoma of the ovary, not a granulosa tumor (<a href="#bib23">Karnezis et al., 2021</a>). Finally, some previous studies have reported growth-factor-based protocols to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells to ovarian granulosa-like cells (<a href="#bib35">Lipskind et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bib29">Lan et al., 2013</a>; <a href="#bib13">Gonen et al., 2021</a>). However, the efficiency of such protocols is low (4–12%, or not reported), the protocols require extended culture (multiple weeks vs. 5 days), and those studies did not demonstrate that the cells could support germ cell maturation. Using monoclonal hiPSC lines, our induction efficiency (&gt;70% in top lines, <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83291/figures#fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</a>) is sufficient to form ovaroids without the need for sorting FOXL2+ cells.</p>
<p>Overall, our rapid, scalable, and efficient method of producing human granulosa-like cells represents a substantial advance over previous studies. We anticipate that this system will prove useful as a model for the study of ovarian development and function, and that further optimization could allow for human in vitro oogenesis.</p>

  <div>
      <p>Two parental hiPSC lines were used in this study: ATCC-BXS0116 female hiPSCs, which we refer to as the F3 line, and the F66 line, an in-house hiPSC line derived from the NIA Aging Cell Repository fibroblast line AG07141 using Epi5 footprint-free episomal reprogramming. The karyotypes of parental lines, as well as engineered reporter lines, were verified by Thermo Fisher Cell ID (single-nucleotide polymorphism-based authentication) + Karyostat, and pluripotency was assessed by Thermo Fisher Pluritest. All lines were identified as normal.</p>
<p>hiPSCs were cultured in mTESR Plus medium (Stemcell Technologies) on standard polystyrene plates coated with hESC-qualified Matrigel (Corning). Medium was changed daily. Passaging was performed using 0.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), or TRYPLE for experiments requiring single-cell dissociation. hiPSCs were treated with 10 µM Y-27632 (Ambeed) for 24 hr after each passage. COV434 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) + 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) + 1× GlutaMax (Gibco). KGN cells (RIKEN, RCB1154) were cultured in DMEM/F12 + 10% FBS + 1× GlutaMax (Gibco). HGL5 cells (ABM cat. T0650) were cultured in Prigrow IV medium (ABM) with 10% FBS. Passaging was performed with TRYPLE (Gibco). hPGCLCs were cultured in S-CM medium as previously described (<a href="#bib25">Kobayashi et al., 2022</a>), and passaged with Accutase (Stemcell Technologies). Mycoplasma testing was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) every 3 months; all cells tested negative.</p>

    </header>

  <p>Electroporations were performed using a Lonza Nucleofector with 96-well shuttle, with 200,000 cells in 20 µl of P3 buffer. Pulse setting CA-137 was used for all electroporations. Selection with the appropriate agent was begun 48 hr after electroporation and continued for 5 days. For the agents used in this study, this time was sufficient to give a high-purity final cell population.</p>

  <div>
      <p>Homology arms for <i>FOXL2</i> were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA. A targeting plasmid, containing an in-frame C-terminal T2A-tdTomato reporter, as well as a Rox-PGK-PuroTK-Rox selection cassette (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83291/figures#fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</a>), was constructed by Gibson assembly. The plasmid backbone additionally had an MC1-DTA marker to select against random integration. sgRNA oligos targeting the C-terminal region of <i>FOXL2</i> were cloned into pX330 (Addgene #42230). For generation of the reporter lines, 1 µg donor plasmid and 1 µg sgRNA plasmid were co-electroporated into hiPSCs, which were subsequently plated in one well of a 6-well plate. After selection with puromycin (400 ng/ml), colonies were picked manually with a P20 pipette. The hiPSC lines generated were genotyped by PCR for the presence of wild-type and reporter alleles. Homozygous clones were further verified by PCR amplification of the entire <i>FOXL2</i> locus (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83291/figures#fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</a>) and Sanger sequencing.</p>
<p>To excise the selection cassette, hiPSCs were electroporated with pCAGGS-Dre (1 µg). Selection was performed with ganciclovir (4 µM) and colonies were picked as described above. The excision of the selection cassette was verified by genotyping. Primers used in this study are listed in <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83291/figures#supp1">Supplementary file 1</a>.</p>

      <h3>TF plasmid construction</h3>
        <a href="https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap83291?item=s4-4">Request a detailed protocol</a>
    </header>

  <p>TF cDNAs were obtained from the TFome (<a href="#bib43">Ng et al., 2021</a>) or the ORFeome (<a href="#bib50">ORFeome Collaboration, 2016</a>) as Gateway entry clones. These were cloned into a barcoded Dox-inducible expression vector (Addgene #175503) using MegaGate cloning (<a href="#bib28">Kramme et al., 2021b</a>). The final expression constructs were verified by Sanger sequencing, which also served to determine the barcode sequences for each TF. Two unique barcodes were used per TF during library pooling. Libraries were pooled using an equimolar quantity of each plasmid (measured using QuBit).</p>

    </header>

  <div>
      <p>A pooled library of barcoded TF plasmids was electroporated into FOXL2-tdTomato reporter hiPSCs, typically at 5 fmol library and 500 ng PiggyBac transposase expression plasmid (Systems Bio). These conditions were chosen to give an average copy number of approximately 5/cell (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83291/figures#fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</a>). Some experiments were also performed at 50 fmol to explore the effects of higher copy numbers. For the screening data presented in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>, two libraries were used: library #1, containing 35 TFs, and library #2, containing 18 TFs. Library #1 was used only at 5 fmol, whereas library #2 was used at both 5 and 50 fmol.</p>
<p>After selection with puromycin (400 ng/ml), hiPSCs were treated with doxycycline (1 µg/ml) in mTESR Plus medium. In additional experiments, hiPSCs were first differentiated to mesoderm following a previously published protocol (<a href="#bib41">Morizane and Bonventre, 2017</a>) before doxycycline treatment. In both sets of experiments, doxycycline treatment continued for 5 days, after which the cells were dissociated with TRYPLE and reporter-positive cells were isolated by FACS. Genomic DNA was extracted (QIAamp DNA Micro kit) from reporter-positive and -negative cells, as well as from the initial population before doxycycline treatment.</p>
<p>Barcodes were amplified by PCR (KAPA polymerase), using 10 ng input gDNA per reaction and typically 22 PCR cycles (95°C 15 s denature, 58°C 20 s anneal/extend). PCR products were purified using ProNex beads, and a second round of PCR (NEB Q5 polymerase, six cycles of 98°C 5 s denature, 61°C 20 s anneal, 72°C 5 s extend, final extension 72°C 2 min) was performed to add Illumina indices (primers are given in <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83291/figures#supp1">Supplementary file 1</a>). These amplicons were again purified using ProNex beads. Samples were normalized and pooled, and barcodes were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq with 10% PhiX spike-in. To call barcodes, reads were aligned to the set of known barcode sequences. Fold changes were calculated by comparing barcode frequencies in the sorted FOXL2+ cells to the frequencies in the starting population.</p>

      <p>Cells were dissociated by treatment with TRYPLE for 5 min, which was quenched with 4 volumes of ice-cold DMEM + 10% FBS. The suspension was passed through a 70-µm cell strainer. Cells were pelleted (200 g, 5 min) and resuspended in staining buffer (PBS + 3% FBS + antibodies, approx. 100 µl per million cells). Staining continued on ice in the dark for 30 min. The suspension was diluted with 9 volumes of PBS + 3% FBS. Cells were pelleted (200 g, 5 min) and resuspended in PBS + 3% FBS + 100 ng/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The suspension was kept on ice in the dark until analysis. Flow cytometry was performed on a BD LSRFortessa, and sorting was performed on a Sony SH800 with 100-µm chip.</p>
<p>Antibody capture beads (BD Biosciences, RRID <a href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_10051478">AB_10051478</a>), or hiPSCs expressing tdTomato, were used as compensation controls. Antibodies used are given in the Key Resources table. Data analysis was performed using the Cytoflow Python package (version 1.0.0, <a href="https://github.com/cytoflow/cytoflow">https://github.com/cytoflow/cytoflow</a>, <a href="#bib69">Teague, 2022</a>).</p>

  <p>iPSCs were dissociated with TRYPLE, and plated in DK10 medium (DMEM–F12, 15 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid [HEPES], 1× GlutaMax, 10% knockout serum replacement [KSR]) with Y-27632 (10 µM), CHIR99021 (3 µM), and doxycycline (1 µg/ml) at a cell density of 12,500/cm<sup>2</sup> on Matrigel-coated polystyrene plates. For 24-well plates the medium volume per well was 0.5 ml; for 6-well plates it was 2 ml. 48 hr after plating, the medium was changed to DK10 + doxycycline (1 µg/ml), and the medium was subsequently changed every 24 hr. Cells were harvested on day 5 unless otherwise indicated. In the no-TF control differentiation for RNA-seq, the protocol was the same except the cells did not contain TF expression plasmids.</p>

      <p>Total RNA was extracted from sorted FOXL2+ granulosa-like cells using the Arcturus PicoPure kit (Thermo Fisher), or from COV434 cells and hiPSCs using the Monarch Total RNA Miniprep kit (NEB). For experiments involving TF overexpression, TF expression plasmids were integrated into hiPSCs as described above (50 fmol/200,000 cells). After selection with puromycin, TF expression was induced using doxycycline (1000 ng/ml).</p>
<p>Two biological replicates were collected for each sample (iPSC, hiPSC+ individual TFs, sorted FOXL2+, no-TF differentiation, KGN, COV434). Libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional kit following the manufacturer’s protocol, and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 (2 × 75 bp paired-end reads). The TPM data shown in <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a> were generated using kallisto (<a href="#bib3">Bray et al., 2016</a>) to pseudoalign reads to the reference human transcriptome (Ensembl GRCh38 v96). Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2. PantherDB (<a href="#bib38">Mi et al., 2021</a>) was used to calculate gene ontology enrichment for significantly upregulated (log<sub>2</sub>fc &gt;3, p<sub>adj</sub> &lt; 0.05) and downregulated (log<sub>2</sub>fc &lt;−3, p<sub>adj</sub> &lt; 0.05) genes for each sample relative to hiPSCs.</p>

  <p>The TROM method was employed to identify associated genes that capture molecular characteristics of biological samples and subsequently comparing the biological samples by testing the overlap of their associated genes (<a href="#bib33">Li et al., 2017</a>). TROM scores were calculated as the −log<sub>10</sub>(Bonferroni corrected p value of association) on a scale of 0–300.

  <div>
      <p>F2 female hPGCLCs (see Key Resources table) were maintained in long-term culture as previously described (<a href="#bib25">Kobayashi et al., 2022</a>). Briefly, hPGCLCs were cultured on Matrigel in STO-conditioned medium (Glasgow Minimum Essential Medium [GMEM] with 13% KSR and 1× non-essential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, and GlutaMax, all from Gibco), supplemented with stem cell factor (SCF) (100 ng/ml, Peprotech), ascorbic acid (50 µg/ml, Gibco), and 2-mercaptoethanol (25 µM, Gibco). hPGCLCs were harvested with Accutase. To form ovaroids, granulosa-like cells were harvested with TRYPLE, counted, and mixed with F2 hPGCLCs. For hormone assays in <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>, we used granulosa-like cells from F3/N.R1 #6, F66/N.R1.G.F #4, F66/N.R1.G #7, F66/N.R2 #1, F66/N.R2 #5, and F66/N.R2.G #3. For immunofluorescence experiments in <a href="#fig4">Figures 4</a> and <a href="#fig5">5</a>, we used F66/N.R1.G.F #4 and F66/N.R2 #1. For scRNA-seq in <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>, we used F66/N.R1.G.F #4.</p>
<p>For each ovaroid, 100,000 granulosa-like cells and 10,000 hPGCLCs were added to each well of a 96-well U-bottom low-bind plate (Corning #7007) in 200 µl of GK15 medium (GMEM, 15% KSR, with 1× GlutaMax, sodium pyruvate, and non-essential amino acids) supplemented with 10 mM Y-27632, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 µg/ml doxycycline, 100 ng/ml SCF, and 50 µg/ml primocin. The plate was centrifuged (100 × <i>g</i>, 2 min) and incubated (37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) for 2 days. Subsequently, ovaroids were transferred to Transwells (collagen-coated polytetrafluoroethylene, 3-µm pore size, 24-mm diameter, Corning #3492) for air–liquid interface culture with Alpha Minimum Essential Medium, 10% KSR, 55 µM 2-mercaptoethanol, 500 ng/ml doxycycline, and 50 µg/ml primocin. Typically five to six ovaroids were cultured on each 6-well Transwell. The medium (1.5 ml) was changed every 2 days.</p>

      <p>Ovaroids were washed with PBS and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde solution in PBS overnight at 4°C. After another PBS wash, ovaroids were detached from the Transwell. In preparation for cryosectioning, ovaroids were transferred to 10% sucrose in PBS. After 24 hr at 4°C, the 10% sucrose solution was removed and replaced with 20% sucrose in PBS. After an additional 24 hr at 4°C, the ovaroids were embedded in OCT compound and stored at −80°C until sectioning.</p>
<p>The ovaroids were sectioned to 10 µm using a Leica CM3050S cryostat. Sections were transferred to Superfrost Plus slides, which were washed with PBS to remove OCT compound. The slides were washed with PBST (0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) and sections were circled with a Pap pen. Slides were blocked for 30 min at room temp. with blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin and 5% normal donkey serum [Jackson ImmunoResearch, #017-000-121, lot #152961] in PBST). The blocking buffer was removed and replaced with a solution of primary antibodies in blocking buffer, and the slides were incubated overnight at 4°C. The antibody solution was removed and the slides were washed with PBST for 3 × 5 min. The slides were incubated with secondary antibody and DAPI solution in blocking buffer for 1 hr. at room temp. in the dark, followed by two 5-min washes with PBST and one wash with PBS. After staining, samples were mounted in Prolong Gold medium and covered with coverslips. Imaging was performed on a Leica SP5 confocal microscope. Antibodies used are given the Key Resources Table. Images were adjusted for brightness (and only for brightness) in ImageJ (version 2.9.0/1.53t), and cell counts for <a href="#fig4">Figure 4C</a> were performed manually by a researcher who was blinded to the species of the ovaroids.</p>

  <p>Ovaroids (6 ovaroids per sample, 2 samples per time point) were dissociated using the Miltenyi Embryoid Body Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi #130-096-348). The cells were passed through a 40-µm strainer, fixed using the Parse Biosciences fixation kit, and stored at −80°C until all time points had been collected. Libraries were prepared using the Parse Biosciences WT Mega v1 kit generating libraries of an average of 450 bp. The ovaroids took up 8 of the 96 samples; the remaining kit capacity was used for other experiments. The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 2 × 150 bp S4 flow cell using single index, 6 bp, libraries and a 5% PhiX spike-in. Data were demultiplexed into library fastq files and counts matrices were generated using Parse Bioscience’s analysis pipeline (version 0.9.6). Downstream data processing, such as doublet filtering, dimensionality reduction, and clustering, was performed using Scanpy (version 1.8.2) (<a href="#bib73">Wolf et al., 2018</a>). For cell type assignment, the fetal ovarian dataset from the human reproductive cell atlas (<a href="#bib11">Garcia-Alonso et al., 2022</a>) was used as a reference for scanpy ingest.</p>

      <p>Androstenedione (500 ng/ml) was added to the medium on day 4 of granulosa differentiation. FSH (0.25 IU/ml, BioVision #4781-50 lot 5F07L47810) or forskolin (100 µM, Sigma-Aldrich) were also added as indicated. The total medium volume was 0.5 ml per well of 24-well plate. We performed these assays on each of the lines listed in <a href="#fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</a>. For controls using human cell lines (COV434, KGN, or HGL5) or mouse primary ovarian somatic cells, 75,000 cells were seeded per well. After 24 hr, the medium was analyzed for estradiol content by ELISA (DRG International, EIA-2693). Concentrations were calculated with a 4-parameter logistic curve fit using the data from the standards provided in the kit. Samples outside the range of the calibration curve were diluted and re-run.</p>
<p>For measuring hormone production in ovaroids, ovaroids were aggregated as described above. Androstenedione (500 ng/ml) and/or FSH (0.25 IU/ml) were added to the aggregation medium (total volume 200 µl per ovaroid). After 3 days of culture, the medium was removed and analyzed by ELISA for estradiol (DRG International, EIA-2693) and progesterone (DRG International, EIA-1561). Hormone concentrations were calculated as described above.</p>

<p><b>Decision letter after peer review:</b></p>
<p>Thank you for submitting your article "Directed Differentiation of Human iPSCs to Functional Ovarian Granulosa-Like Cells via Transcription Factor Overexpression" for consideration by <i>eLife</i>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p>
<p>Essential revisions:</p>
<p>1) Include a diagram to illustrate the experimental workflow of the study</p>
<p>2) Improve the quality of images and colors in Figure 3 and 4. In Figure 3, the <i>Foxl2</i>+ cells do not seem to be in a position similar to what is typically observed in vivo in ovaries.</p>
<p>3) Provide a clear rationale for using different endpoints for different cell lines.</p>
<p>4) The ovaroid data requires an OCT4+ and DAZL+ expression over the total analysis of the study.</p>
<p>5) The actual transcription factors used in the study need to be clearly described in the Discussion section.</p>
<p><i>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</i></p>
<p>I got lost at the beginning of the manuscript trying to understand exactly all the steps that led to the generation of the granulosa-like cells. It would be helpful to include a diagram to illustrate the experimental workflow of the study similar to a graphical abstract.</p>
<p>In Figure 3, I have several recommendations to facilitate the interpretation of the data</p>
<p>– The authors mention several times that they observe follicle-like formation in their ovaroid model, but in the IF images the <i>FOXL2</i>+ and AMHR2 staining is scattered and looks nothing like the spherical arrangement of squamous (primordial) or cuboidal (growing) cells one would expect to see in the in vivo ovary. In addition, there is no evidence in figures 3 or S5 that DAZL+ hPGCLCs become surrounded by <i>FOXL2</i>+ granulosa-like cells. I suggest replacing the images with better-quality IF stains, or the authors should soften the conclusion that follicle-like structures do form in their ovaroid model.</p>
<p>– The images in panel A Day 2 and Day 4 appear to be on a different scale than the rest, which is confusing.</p>
<p>– The merged images on the right are not legible, consider removing the DAPI channel from these so that the reader can better appreciate the staining overlap or lack thereof.</p>
<p>– In figure 4C, I find the integration onto the human cell atlas very helpful. However, it is confusing that the UMAP no longer corresponds to the cluster distribution shown in figure 4A. I would suggest adding an additional visual that shows the projection of the human cell atlas cell ID onto the original clusters of the ovaroid scRNAseq. Also, how do the authors explain that RUNX1 expression is very low in the <i>FOXL2</i>+ granulosa-like cluster (Figure 4B)?</p>
<p>Some of the data is difficult to evaluate in the figures.</p>
<p>– The bar histograms in figures 2d and e are very compact and difficult to tell apart. Also, the colors are not colorblind-friendly. I recommend changing the colors to more accessible color combinations in these and in figure 4D.</p>
<p>– The images of the ovaroids lack annotations to guide the readers to what is relevant, and the staining quality is suboptimal, making it difficult to interpret the similarity of these ovariods to in vivo ovaries.</p>
<p><i>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</i></p>
<p>This study from Smela et al. describes the production and functional characterisation of granulosa-like cells from induced pluripotent stem cells. The key claim is that two transcription factors – NR5A1, and either RUNX1 or RUNX2 – are collectively necessary and sufficient for the production of these cells (abstract line 9, results page 7 line 21, discussion page 16 line 9). While sufficiency for a selected set of characteristics is in part supported by functional and transcriptional analyses, the claim of necessity is not directly tested. If this claim of necessity is to stand, then the authors must clarify their use of this term, or alternatively, describe experiments they have undertaken that would justify this claim. Given the extensive data presented in figure 1b, the threshold used for this justification should also be described in much greater detail.</p>
<p>Impressively, this paper describes the rapid development of the germline when human-human chimeras are used, and this is a major strength of the study (figure 3). I do however find the use of the term "ovaroid" to be somewhat problematic. An ovary contains many more than two cell types, and a more nuanced term is strongly advised, potentially related to the production of a follicle-like structure.</p>
<p>While many suitable approaches are performed, the use of COV434 cells is not well-founded. As the authors note, there is some uncertainty regarding the identity of COV434 cells, and as a cancer cell type, are unlikely to reflect embryonic granulosa cells. A more appropriate control might be the starting iPS cells (as presented), or the various sublines developed, from which a more realistic assessment of the TROM value can be drawn. As presented, this transcriptional analysis cannot be used to justify the identity of the TF-induced granulosa-like cells. The authors acknowledge the issues with COV434 cells on page 9 lines 11-14, which further justifies an alternative approach.</p>
<p>The regulatory logic described in Figure 2c is not clearly described, and a much more rigorous description of the data underlying these findings should be included.</p>
<p>The section that describing the functional maturation of germline cells (via activation of DAZL and DDX4) is limited in scope, and the manuscript would benefit from orthogonal approaches to demonstrate the engraftment of these cells into follicle-like structures, or transcriptional analyses supporting the claims.</p>
<p><i>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</i></p>
<p>Additional Analyses:</p>
<p>1. Are multiple iPSC lines – biological variables – used to differentiate into granulosa-like cells? It seems this was only tested on lines from ATCC-BXS0116 and not confirmed in another biologically different line. Testing additional lines with the established protocol is necessary to increase robustness.</p>
<p>2. There are no images of ovaroids treated with androstenedione or FSH for the E2 and P4 experiments.</p>
<p>3. The ovaroid data was descriptive and requires an OCT4+ and DAZL+ cell over total analysis overtime to support the descriptive claims that these cell types underwent "rapid development" and "declined over time" and to become compare the results from the hPSCs against the murine fetal cells. While the authors do perform an analysis of Dazl-expressing cells in Figure 4D, this is not what is referred to in the paragraphs of results above and there are no comparisons with murine ovaroids here.</p>
<p>4. Which cells in the ovaroid come from the granulosa-like cell lines versus those that were differentiated into PGCLCs? It will be important to distinguish these populations in "follicle-like" cultures and to confirm that both are still present.</p>
<p>Editorial or data description suggestions:</p>
<p>1. "The description of experimentation within the Results section must be more clear."</p>
<p>a. The data represented in Figure 2C and SFiles 2 must be presented in a form that demonstrates the relative fold change of expression for each doxy-inducible transcription factor lines in a main figure.</p>
<p>b. The description of iPSC lines that have one or more TF must be clearly stated. And the results must be clearly described for each line tested. For example, on page 11 "The fourth of our granulosa lines produced high levels of estradiol in all conditions, and this line lacked the RUNX1 expression vector that was present in the others." Which four lines were used and in which order the authors are referring to them to deduce the "fourth line" was not made clear. Which TFs were in the lines that were picked for "phenotype" on page 12? First described on page 13 – which lines were used as the granulosa-like lines?</p>
<p>c. Figure 2 – 2 biological replicates for 4 clones? What does G1, G2, G3, G4 mean in Figure 2E? Are these different monoclonal granulosa-like cells from those shown in 2D? If so, why were they chosen?</p>
<p>2. It is not obvious which iPSC lines were used to generate the hPGCLCs or GLCs in the ovaroid cultures. This should be stated in the results and methods.</p>
<p>3. Page 13 lines 12-14 compare the expression of SOX17, OCT4, DAZL, and TFAP2C. However, the day in culture chosen for these IF analyses were different. This sentence should be reworded to more accurately state that OCT4 and DAZL expression was still visible on day 32 and SOX17 expression on day 8 in human…</p>
<p>4. Are OCT4- and DAZL+ oogonia visible on day 32? The line on page 13, line 14 states that "at later timepoints (day 16), DaZL+…" This is confusing because there is an image for DAZL and OCT4 antibodies at day 32 in Figure 3.</p>
<p>5. The germ cell populations in Figure 4D are not mentioned in the text.</p>
<p>6. The discussion should clearly summarize/restate the transcription factors used and steps to efficiently generate the granulosa-like cells from hiPSCs.</p>
<p>7. There needs to be clarity on which lines were used for each experiment in the Materials and methods.</p>

<p>We have included this as Figure 5C.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>5) The actual transcription factors used in the study need to be clearly described in the Discussion section.</p>

  
</blockquote>
<p>We have added this to the Discussion section, added a table showing which TFs are in which lines (Figure 3 – Source Data 2), and also provided PCR data verifying this (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). Additionally, we have re-named our cell lines to be more informative about which TFs they express.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p>
<p>I got lost at the beginning of the manuscript trying to understand exactly all the steps that led to the generation of the granulosa-like cells. It would be helpful to include a diagram to illustrate the experimental workflow of the study similar to a graphical abstract.</p>

  
</blockquote>
<p>We have included this as Figure 1.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In Figure 3, I have several recommendations to facilitate the interpretation of the data</p>
<p>– The authors mention several times that they observe follicle-like formation in their ovaroid model, but in the IF images the FOXL2+ and AMHR2 staining is scattered and looks nothing like the spherical arrangement of squamous (primordial) or cuboidal (growing) cells one would expect to see in the in vivo ovary. In addition, there is no evidence in figures 3 or S5 that DAZL+ hPGCLCs become surrounded by FOXL2+ granulosa-like cells. I suggest replacing the images with better-quality IF stains, or the authors should soften the conclusion that follicle-like structures do form in their ovaroid model.</p>

  
</blockquote>
<p>We have collected additional immunofluorescence images from day 70 of ovaroid culture, which clearly show follicle-like structures of <i>FOXL2</i>+ AMHR2+ cells (Figure 5).</p>
<p>We agree that the follicles are empty (not containing hPGCLCs), and we mention this in the Results section.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>– The images in panel A Day 2 and Day 4 appear to be on a different scale than the rest, which is confusing.</p>

  
</blockquote>
<p>We have swapped these for different images which have the same magnification as the rest.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>– The merged images on the right are not legible, consider removing the DAPI channel from these so that the reader can better appreciate the staining overlap or lack thereof.</p>

  
</blockquote>
<p>We have done this, and also changed the colors to make them more legible.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>– In figure 4C, I find the integration onto the human cell atlas very helpful. However, it is confusing that the UMAP no longer corresponds to the cluster distribution shown in figure 4A. I would suggest adding an additional visual that shows the projection of the human cell atlas cell ID onto the original clusters of the ovaroid scRNAseq.</p>

  
</blockquote>
<p>We have done this.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Also, how do the authors explain that RUNX1 expression is very low in the FOXL2+ granulosa-like cluster (Figure 4B)?</p>

  
</blockquote>
<p><i>RUNX1</i> expression is not very low in the granulosa cluster. In the original version of the violin plot (which is now figure 7B), the default setting of the width scaling factor was too small, which made it look like there wasn’t much <i>RUNX1</i>. We have since corrected this. The distribution of <i>RUNX1</i> expression is shown in <a href="#sa2fig1">Author response image 1</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some of the data is difficult to evaluate in the figures.</p>
<p>– The bar histograms in figures 2d and e are very compact and difficult to tell apart. Also, the colors are not colorblind-friendly. I recommend changing the colors to more accessible color combinations in these and in figure 4D.</p>

  
</blockquote>
<p>We have changed the colors in these figures to a colorblind-friendly palette. Also, we separated the ELISA and bulk RNA-seq figures so that the bar plots can be bigger.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>– The images of the ovaroids lack annotations to guide the readers to what is relevant, and the staining quality is suboptimal, making it difficult to interpret the similarity of these ovariods to in vivo ovaries.</p>

  
</blockquote>
<p>We have added annotations to better show the follicle-like structures in figure 6.</p>
<p>The figure files in the original manuscript were at lower resolution because there was a file size limit on the PDF upload. We have provided original-resolution versions of the figures in our resubmission. We note that the original versions of our immunofluorescence figures were simply the raw image files not adjusted for brightness/contrast. We have since adjusted the brightness of these images in the figures (as most other papers do), and this improves their interpretability. We have also chosen a better color palette. There is still some background staining in a few of the images but this should not affect the conclusions of our paper.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p>
<p>This study from Smela et al. describes the production and functional characterisation of granulosa-like cells from induced pluripotent stem cells. The key claim is that two transcription factors – NR5A1, and either RUNX1 or RUNX2 – are collectively necessary and sufficient for the production of these cells (abstract line 9, results page 7 line 21, discussion page 16 line 9). While sufficiency for a selected set of characteristics is in part supported by functional and transcriptional analyses, the claim of necessity is not directly tested. If this claim of necessity is to stand, then the authors must clarify their use of this term, or alternatively, describe experiments they have undertaken that would justify this claim. Given the extensive data presented in figure 1b, the threshold used for this justification should also be described in much greater detail.</p>

  
</blockquote>
<p>We have removed the claim of necessity, since it’s possible that other TFs outside of the set we tested could also produce granulosa-like cells.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Impressively, this paper describes the rapid development of the germline when human-human chimeras are used, and this is a major strength of the study (figure 3). I do however find the use of the term "ovaroid" to be somewhat problematic. An ovary contains many more than two cell types, and a more nuanced term is strongly advised, potentially related to the production of a follicle-like structure.</p>

  
</blockquote>
<p>Although our organoids do not contain all the cell types of the ovary, they do contain several important ones such as <i>FOXL2</i>+ granulosa-like cells, NR2F2+ stroma-like cells, and hPGCLCs. The name “ovaroid” is intended to describe a system resembling an ovary, not an actual ovary.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>While many suitable approaches are performed, the use of COV434 cells is not well-founded. As the authors note, there is some uncertainty regarding the identity of COV434 cells, and as a cancer cell type, are unlikely to reflect embryonic granulosa cells. A more appropriate control might be the starting iPS cells (as presented), or the various sublines developed, from which a more realistic assessment of the TROM value can be drawn. As presented, this transcriptional analysis cannot be used to justify the identity of the TF-induced granulosa-like cells. The authors acknowledge the issues with COV434 cells on page 9 lines 11-14, which further justifies an alternative approach.</p>

  
</blockquote>
<p>We have collected additional RNA-seq data from KGN cells, which are phenotypically closer to bona fide granulosa cells in terms of steroidogenesis and marker gene expression. In our TROM analysis, the control is the starting iPSCs (which we find to have a TROM score of zero with all of the other samples).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The regulatory logic described in Figure 2c is not clearly described, and a much more rigorous description of the data underlying these findings should be included.</p>

  
</blockquote>
<p>We have clarified that this chart displays upregulation of genes of interest in response to TF overexpression. We have also included volcano plots to numerically show the regulatory effects.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The section that describing the functional maturation of germline cells (via activation of DAZL and DDX4) is limited in scope, and the manuscript would benefit from orthogonal approaches to demonstrate the engraftment of these cells into follicle-like structures, or transcriptional analyses supporting the claims.</p>

  
</blockquote>
<p>Although we now have strong evidence for the formation of follicle-like structures (Figure 6) we have not observed any germ cells inside of these follicles. We do mention that these follicles are empty in the Results section. Future studies using optimized culture conditions to promote germ cell survival will be necessary to address this. Regarding transcriptional analysis, we have now performed a differential expression and gene ontology enrichment analysis on <i>DAZL+</i> vs <i>DAZL-</i> germ cells in our ovaroids, which we describe in the Results section.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p>
<p>Additional Analyses:</p>
<p>1. Are multiple iPSC lines – biological variables – used to differentiate into granulosa-like cells? It seems this was only tested on lines from ATCC-BXS0116 and not confirmed in another biologically different line. Testing additional lines with the established protocol is necessary to increase robustness.</p>

  
</blockquote>
<p>We tested this on both F3 (ATCC-BXS0116) and F66 (an hiPSC line derived in-house from NIA Aging Cell Repository fibroblast line AG07141). A full list of lines is given in Figure 3 – Source Data 2.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>2. There are no images of ovaroids treated with androstenedione or FSH for the E2 and P4 experiments.</p>

  
</blockquote>
<p>We tried to do whole-mount staining on these, but this was unsuccessful and we were not able to get any good images. We do have brightfield images of the ovaroids, but these are not very informative (the samples are too thick to see much detail), and there do not seem to be any major differences in appearance between the conditions.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>3. The ovaroid data was descriptive and requires an OCT4+ and DAZL+ cell over total analysis overtime to support the descriptive claims that these cell types underwent "rapid development" and "declined over time" and to become compare the results from the hPSCs against the murine fetal cells. While the authors do perform an analysis of Dazl-expressing cells in Figure 4D, this is not what is referred to in the paragraphs of results above and there are no comparisons with murine ovaroids here.</p>

  
</blockquote>
<p>We have performed this analysis and it is now presented in Figure 5C.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>4. Which cells in the ovaroid come from the granulosa-like cell lines versus those that were differentiated into PGCLCs? It will be important to distinguish these populations in "follicle-like" cultures and to confirm that both are still present.</p>

  
</blockquote>
<p>We do not currently have enough information to definitively assign the origins of the cells in the ovaroids. However, we consider it unlikely that DAZL+ cells could originate from our granulosa-like cells, since DAZL expression is highly specific to gonadal PGCs (see Refs. 15–17). Also we do not see <i>DAZL</i> expression in bulk RNA-seq data of our <i>FOXL2</i>+ cells (see Source Data for figure 3A).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Editorial or data description suggestions:</p>
<p>1. "The description of experimentation within the Results section must be more clear."</p>
<p>a. The data represented in Figure 2C and SFiles 2 must be presented in a form that demonstrates the relative fold change of expression for each doxy-inducible transcription factor lines in a main figure.</p>

  
</blockquote>
<p>We have added volcano plots to Figure 3 which depict the fold-changes for genes of interest, including our transcription factors. Full data are provided in the source data for that figure.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>b. The description of iPSC lines that have one or more TF must be clearly stated. And the results must be clearly described for each line tested. For example, on page 11 "The fourth of our granulosa lines produced high levels of estradiol in all conditions, and this line lacked the RUNX1 expression vector that was present in the others." Which four lines were used and in which order the authors are referring to them to deduce the "fourth line" was not made clear. Which TFs were in the lines that were picked for "phenotype" on page 12? First described on page 13 – which lines were used as the granulosa-like lines?</p>

  
</blockquote>
<p>We changed our naming of the clones to clearly describe which TFs are present, and also made a list of all the clones in Figure 3 – Source Data 2.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>c. Figure 2 – 2 biological replicates for 4 clones? What does G1, G2, G3, G4 mean in Figure 2E? Are these different monoclonal granulosa-like cells from those shown in 2D? If so, why were they chosen?</p>

  
</blockquote>
<p>We have tested additional clones (now all nine of our top clones, instead of just four). We also changed our naming of the clones to be more descriptive.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>2. It is not obvious which iPSC lines were used to generate the hPGCLCs or GLCs in the ovaroid cultures. This should be stated in the results and methods.</p>

  
</blockquote>
<p>We have added this.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>3. Page 13 lines 12-14 compare the expression of SOX17, OCT4, DAZL, and TFAP2C. However, the day in culture chosen for these IF analyses were different. This sentence should be reworded to more accurately state that OCT4 and DAZL expression was still visible on day 32 and SOX17 expression on day 8 in human…</p>

  
</blockquote>
<p>We reworded this following your suggestion.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>4. Are OCT4- and DAZL+ oogonia visible on day 32? The line on page 13, line 14 states that "at later timepoints (day 16), DaZL+…" This is confusing because there is an image for DAZL and OCT4 antibodies at day 32 in Figure 3.</p>

  
</blockquote>
<p>We clarified that DAZL+/OCT4- and DAZL+/OCT4+ cells are both present.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>5. The germ cell populations in Figure 4D are not mentioned in the text.</p>

  
</blockquote>
<p>The “germ cells” are the cells annotated as germ cells by our fetal ovary atlas integration. We have indicated this in the text.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>6. The discussion should clearly summarize/restate the transcription factors used and steps to efficiently generate the granulosa-like cells from hiPSCs.</p>

  
</blockquote>
<p>We have added this.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>7. There needs to be clarity on which lines were used for each experiment in the Materials and methods.</p>

  
</blockquote>
<p>We have added this.</p>
