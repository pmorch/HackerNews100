		<p>On Saturday evening, <a href="https://decripto.org/it/arrestato-a-parigi-il-fondatore-di-telegram-pavel-durov-preso-in-custodia-dai-servizi-segreti/">Pavel Durov</a>, founder and CEO of Telegram, was arrested at Le Bourget airport in Paris. The arrest took place as Durov, accompanied by his bodyguard and a woman, stepped off a private jet that had arrived from Azerbaijan. The arrest was made on the basis of a French search warrant issued by the National Directorate of Judicial Police, following a preliminary investigation. Durov was placed on a federal wanted list and the warrant was issued because of his alleged failure to cooperate with the French authorities.</p>


<p>Durov is accused of numerous serious crimes, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Terrorism</strong></li>



<li><strong>Drug trafficking</strong></li>



<li><strong>Complicity in criminal activities</strong></li>



<li><strong>Fraud</strong></li>



<li><strong>Money laundering</strong></li>



<li><strong>Concealment of illegal activities</strong></li>



<li><strong>Distribution of child sexual abuse content</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>French authorities believe that Telegram, under Durov’s leadership, became a major platform for organised crime due to its encrypted messaging services, which allegedly facilitated illegal activities. Investigators have taken Durov into custody and he is expected to be brought before a judge soon. The seriousness of the charges could lead to a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.</p>


<p><strong>Impact on the crypto TON</strong></p>


<p>The arrest had an immediate impact on the cryptocurrency market. Toncoin, the cryptocurrency associated with Telegram, fell significantly, dropping more than 15% on the markets after the news of the arrest.</p>


<p><strong>The European Union’s accusations</strong></p>


<p>The main accusation by EU authorities concerns Telegram’s encrypted messaging services, which were allegedly used to facilitate organised crime. One investigator stated that ‘Telegram has become the number one platform for organised crime over the years’, underlining the perceived link between the platform’s privacy features and criminal activities.</p>


<p><strong>Durov is French: he will face trial in France</strong></p>


<p>As a French citizen, Durov will be tried in France and will have to answer to the charges against him. The case could have major legal repercussions and influence the regulation of digital platforms and cryptocurrencies in the future.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content-parent"><p>A few days ago, my jazz piano teacher sent me the new fall/winter schedule for my private jazz piano lessons -- 13 different dates -- as a JPG (mine are outlined in green marker):</p>

<p>I was too lazy to go make 13 entries in Google Calendar, so I decided to see if Claude could help me out:</p>
<p>I first uploaded the jpg to Claude 3.5 Sonnet)...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>My prompt:</strong> List the dates that are outlined in green</p>
<p>The dates outlined in green in the image are:</p>
<p>Friday, 13-Sep-24 Friday, 27-Sep-24 Friday, 11-Oct-24 Friday, 8-Nov-24 Friday, 6-Dec-24 Friday, 20-Dec-24 Friday, 17-Jan-25 Friday, 31-Jan-25 Friday, 28-Feb-25 Friday, 14-Mar-25 Friday, 11-Apr-25 Friday, 25-Apr-25 Friday, 23-May-25</p>
<p>These dates correspond to the Friday column for students who have their first every-other-week lesson starting the week of Tuesday Sept 10, 2024.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cool - that was easy and accurate. Now I need to get it into my calendar, so I asked it to create an <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">ics</a> file...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>My prompt:</strong> Create a calendar ics file that creates an appointment on each of those dates at 2pm pacific time. The appointment title will be “Jazz Piano Lesson”</p>
<p>Certainly. I'll create an ICS (iCalendar) file with appointments for "Jazz Piano Lesson" on each of the dates you specified, set for 2:00 PM Pacific Time.</p>

<p>I've created an ICS file with the following details:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Each event is titled "Jazz Piano Lesson"</p>
</li>
<li><p>The events are scheduled for 2:00 PM Pacific Time on each of the specified dates</p>
</li>
<li><p>Each event is set to last for one hour</p>
</li>
<li><p>The time zone is properly adjusted to UTC (Z) in the file</p>
</li>
<li><p>Unique identifiers (UIDs) are provided for each event</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can save this content as a .ics file and import it into most calendar applications. Here are a few notes about the file:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The times are in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). 2:00 PM Pacific Time translates to 9:00 PM UTC (21:00) for dates not in Daylight Saving Time, and 10:00 PM UTC (22:00) for dates within Daylight Saving Time. The file accounts for these changes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The DTSTAMP for all events is set to the date of this conversation (August 24, 2024) as a placeholder. Your calendar application will likely update this when you import the events.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The UID for each event is unique, based on the date of the lesson and a simple string.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To use this file:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Copy the content of the artifact</p>
</li>
<li><p>Paste it into a new text file</p>
</li>
<li><p>Save the file with a .ics extension (e.g., "jazz_piano_lessons.ics")</p>
</li>
<li><p>Import this file into your preferred calendar application</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Most calendar applications should be able to read this file and create the appropriate recurring events. Let me know if you need any modifications or have any questions!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I went to <a href="http://calendar.google.com/" target="_blank">calendar.google.com</a>, imported the ics, and my appointments were imported perfectly!<br>(To import ics files into Google calendar, go to the calendar settings, then to import/export)</p>
<p>I'm pleasantly surprised at how easy this was!</p>
<p>I tried the exact same thing in ChatGPT -- it identified the dates in the images, but it was unable to create an .ics file. However, it did give me some Python code to create the ics file for me.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://anyblockers.com/posts/postgres-as-a-search-engine">https://anyblockers.com/posts/postgres-as-a-search-engine</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41343814">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Build a retrieval system with semantic, full-text, and fuzzy search in Postgres to be used as a backbone in RAG pipelines.</p><div>  <p><strong>Search is hard</strong>. It’s a critical part of many apps, but getting it right isn’t easy. This is especially true for RAG-pipelines where the quality of retrieval can make or break the entire process.</p>
<p>While semantic search is trendy, good old lexical search is still the backbone. Semantic techniques can improve results, but they work best when added to a solid text-based search foundation.</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll explore how to use Postgres to create a robust search engine. We’ll combine three techniques:</p>
<ol>
<li>Full-text search with <code>tsvector</code></li>
<li>Semantic search with <code>pgvector</code></li>
<li>Fuzzy matching with <code>pg_trgm</code></li>
<li>Bonus: BM25</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach might not be the absolute best for every situation, but it’s a great alternative to setting up a separate search service. It’s a solid starting point that you can implement and scale within your existing Postgres database.</p>
<p>I won’t go into why you should Just Use Postgres™️ for everything, but if you want to read about it, here are a couple of good resources:</p>

<h2 id="table-with-four-legs"><a data-heading-link="" href="#table-with-four-legs">Table with four legs</a></h2>
<p>This is the table we’ll work with as an example.</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span><span>create</span><span> table</span><span> documents</span><span> (</span></span>
<span><span>    id </span><span>bigint</span><span> primary key</span><span> generated</span><span> always</span><span> as</span><span> identity</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    title </span><span>text</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    fts_title tsvector </span><span>generated</span><span> always</span><span> as</span><span> (to_tsvector(</span><span>'english'</span><span>, title)) stored,</span></span>
<span><span>    embedding vector(</span><span>1536</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>);</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>We’ll evolve this table down the road.
Since Supabase has a great article on implementing hybrid search, we’ll use that as a starting point. <a href="https://supabase.com/docs/guides/ai/hybrid-search" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hybrid search<span><img src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=supabase.com&amp;sz=64"></span></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Follow the guide to implement FTS with GIN-indexes and semantic search with pgvector (also known as bi-encoder dense retrieval).</li>
<li>From personal experience, I’d opt for 1536 dimensional embeddings since it’s gotten me way better results. Source: trust me.</li>
<li>I’ve replaced the Supabase function with just CTEs and a query, as well as prefixed the params with <code>$</code>. Here’s what it’ll look like:</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span><span>with</span><span> full_text </span><span>as</span><span> (</span></span>

<span><span>limit</span></span>
<span><span>    least</span><span>($match_count, </span><span>30</span><span>);</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>Note: We’re using <code>coalesce</code> in several places for important reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the <code>join</code> clause:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span><span>join</span><span> documents</span></span>
<span><span>    on</span><span> coalesce</span><span>(</span><span>full_text</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>, </span><span>semantic</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>) </span><span>=</span><span> documents</span><span>.</span><span>id</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>This ensures that we include results from both full-text and semantic searches, even if a document appears in only one of these result sets. If a document is found by full-text search but not by semantic search (or vice versa), we still want to include it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <code>order by</code> clause:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span><span>coalesce</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span> /</span><span> ($rrf_k </span><span>+</span><span> full_text</span><span>.</span><span>rank_ix</span><span>), </span><span>0</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>) </span><span>*</span><span> $full_text_weight </span><span>+</span></span>
<span><span>coalesce</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span> /</span><span> ($rrf_k </span><span>+</span><span> semantic</span><span>.</span><span>rank_ix</span><span>), </span><span>0</span><span>.</span><span>0</span><span>) </span><span>*</span><span> $semantic_weight</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>This handles cases where a document might be present in one search result but not the other. If a document isn’t in the full-text results, its <code>full_text.rank_ix</code> will be NULL, so we use <code>coalesce</code> to treat it as 0.0 in the ranking calculation. The same applies for semantic search results.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Here we’re using Reciprocal Ranked Fusion (RRF) to merge the results.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This method ensures that items ranked high in multiple lists are given a high rank in the final list. It also ensures that items ranked high in only a few lists but low in others are not given a high rank in the final list. Placing the rank in the denominator when calculating score helps penalize the low ranking records.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s also worth noting:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>$rrf_k</code>: To prevent extremely high scores for items ranked first (since we’re dividing by the rank), a k constant is often added to the denominator to smooth the score.</li>
<li><code>$ _weight</code>: We can assign a weight to each method. This is very useful when you’re tuning the results.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="implementing-fuzzy-search"><a data-heading-link="" href="#implementing-fuzzy-search">Implementing fuzzy search</a></h2>
<p>While this gets us a long way, an immediate issue will be typos in named entities. While semantic search eliminates some of these issues by capturing similarity, it struggles to do so for names, acronyms, and other text that’s not semantically similar. To mitigate this, we’ll introduce the <code>pg_trgm</code> extension to allow for fuzzy searching.</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span><span>create</span><span> extension </span><span>if</span><span> not</span><span> exists</span><span> pg_trgm;</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>It operates with Trigrams. Here’s how it works:</p>
<p><img src="https://anyblockers.com/_astro/trigrams.CyxTPrsW_Z4ew9V.svg" alt="Trigrams" width="800" height="300" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>Trigrams are useful for fuzzy search because they break down words into three-character sequences. This allows for matching similar words even if they contain typos or slight variations. For example, “hello” and “helo” share many trigrams, making them easier to match in a fuzzy search.</p>
<p>You have to create a new index for the desired column like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span><span>create</span><span> index</span><span> idx_documents_title_trgm</span><span> on</span><span> documents </span><span>using</span><span> gin (title gin_trgm_ops);</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>After that, you need to add it to the full search query. The extension exposes the % operator to filter out text where similarity is larger than <code>pg_trgm.similarity_threshold</code> (default is 0.3). There are also several other operators that are useful. Everything is well documented here: <a href="https://www.postgres.org/docs/current/pgtrgm.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pg_trgm — support for similarity of text using trigram matching<span><img src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.postgres.org&amp;sz=64"></span></a></p>

<p>When getting the results back, it’s very useful to understand why something matched and not. First, we need to ensure we’re returning all scores from the various CTEs.</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span><span>semantic </span><span>as</span><span> (</span></span>

<p>Now, your actual documents might actually include some content and not just a title. Let’s go ahead and add a <code>body</code> column.</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="sql"><code><span><span>create</span><span> table</span><span> documents</span><span> (</span></span>
<span><span>    id </span><span>bigint</span><span> primary key</span><span> generated</span><span> always</span><span> as</span><span> identity</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    title </span><span>text</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    body </span><span>text</span><span>, </span></span>
<span><span>    fts_title tsvector </span><span>generated</span><span> always</span><span> as</span><span> (to_tsvector(</span><span>'english'</span><span>, title)) stored, </span></span>
<span><span>    fts_body tsvector </span><span>generated</span><span> always</span><span> as</span><span> (to_tsvector(</span><span>'english'</span><span>, body)) stored, </span></span>
<span><span>    embedding vector(</span><span>1536</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>);</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>As you can see, we’ll only keep a single embedding column even though we have multiple fields. Personally, I’ve found no significant performance in keeping multiple embeddings, but instead keeping both <code>title</code> and <code>body</code> in the same. After all, the <code>title</code> should™️ be a short representation of the body. I encourage you to experiment with this based on your needs.</p>
<p>Now, let’s look at the <code>fts_</code> columns. We expect the title to be short and keyword-rich, while the body will be longer and include more details. Thus we need to adjust how the full text search columns are weighed against each other. Read the docs to get a better understanding here: <a href="https://www.postgres.org/docs/current/textsearch-controls.html#TEXTSEARCH-RANKING" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">12.3.3. Ranking Search Results<span><img src="https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.postgres.org&amp;sz=64"></span></a>. Here’s the tl;dr:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weights allow prioritizing words based on their location or importance in the document.</li>
<li>A-weight: Most important (e.g., title, headers). Default <code>1.0</code></li>
<li>B-weight: Important (e.g., beginning of document, abstract). Default <code>0.4</code></li>
<li>C-weight: Standard importance (e.g., main body text). Default <code>0.2</code></li>
<li>D-weight: Least important (e.g., footnotes, annotations). Default <code>0.1</code></li>
<li>Adjust weights to fine-tune relevance based on document structure and application needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The title is given more weight than the body because it’s typically a concise representation of the document’s main topic. Users often scan titles first when searching, so matching keywords in the title are usually more relevant to the user’s intent than matches in the body text.</p>
<p>With this information, we can go ahead and update the indexes:</p>

<h3 id="adjusting-for-length"><a data-heading-link="" href="#adjusting-for-length">Adjusting for length</a></h3>
<p>If you read the documentation for <code>ts_rank_cd</code> you saw that there’s a normalization parameter. If not, here it is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both ranking functions take an integer <code>normalization</code> option that specifies whether and how a document’s length should impact its rank. The integer option controls several behaviors, so it is a bit mask: you can specify one or more behaviors using <code>|</code> (for example, <code>2|4</code>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can use these various options to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adjust for document length bias</li>
<li>Balance relevance across diverse document sets</li>
<li>Scale ranking results for consistent presentation</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://anyblockers.com/_astro/document-length-normalization.DS5tgXDF_Z155tVw.svg" alt="Document Length Normalization" width="800" height="400" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>













































<table><thead><tr><th>Option Value</th><th>When to Use</th><th>Use Case</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>No normalization (<code>0</code>)</td><td>When you want raw ranking scores without adjustments</td><td>Comparing documents of similar length and structure</td></tr><tr><td>Log length normalization (<code>1</code>)</td><td>When you want to mildly reduce the impact of document length</td><td>Mixed-length documents where longer docs shouldn’t dominate</td></tr><tr><td>Length normalization (<code>2</code>)</td><td>When you want to strongly normalize by document length</td><td>Diverse document lengths where content density matters more than total matches</td></tr><tr><td>Harmonic mean distance (ts_rank_cd only) (<code>4</code>)</td><td>When you want to consider term proximity in ranking</td><td>Phrases or closely related terms are important in your search</td></tr><tr><td>Unique word normalization (<code>8</code>)</td><td>When you want to favor documents with more diverse vocabulary</td><td>Rewarding content richness over repetition</td></tr><tr><td>Log unique word normalization (<code>16</code>)</td><td>When you want to mildly reduce the impact of vocabulary diversity</td><td>Balancing between vocabulary richness and raw term frequency</td></tr><tr><td>Scaling to 0-1 range (<code>32</code>)</td><td>When you need a consistent score range for all queries</td><td>Displaying scores as percentages or progress bars</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Combine options using bitwise OR (<code>|</code>) for more nuanced normalization. For example:</p>
<p>Use <code>2|4</code> to normalize by both length and term proximity
Use <code>1|8</code> for a balanced approach considering both document length and vocabulary diversity</p>
<p>I’ve found good results with setting <code>0</code> (no normalization) for the title and <code>1</code> (logarithmic doc length) for the body. Again, I encourage you to experiment with different options to find the best fit for your use case.</p>
<h2 id="reranking-with-cross-encoder"><a data-heading-link="" href="#reranking-with-cross-encoder">Reranking with cross-encoder</a></h2>
<p>Many retrieval systems are two-step based. This means you’ll use a bi-directional encoder to retrieve the initial N results, then a cross-encoder to rank these against the search query.</p>
<p>The bi-encoder is fast, making it great for searching a multitude of documents. The cross-encoder is slower but more performant, making it great for reranking retrieved results.</p>
<p>Cross-encoders differ from bi-encoders in that they process the query and document together, allowing for more nuanced understanding of the relationship between them. This results in better ranking accuracy but at the cost of computation time and scalability. Here’s a simple diagram to illustrate the process:</p>

<p>To provide an even better user experience, you might want to boost certain columns depending on your use case. For example, in a knowledge search, you might want to boost search results that the user has interacted with. You also might want to boost recently changed results.</p>
<p>Boosting recent results or user-specific results can improve UX because it personalizes the search experience. Recent results are often more relevant, especially for time-sensitive information. User-specific boosts can surface content the user has previously found useful, making their search more efficient.</p>

<p>While Postgres is a solid choice for many search scenarios, it’s not without limitations. The lack of advanced algorithms like BM25 can be felt when dealing with diverse document lengths. <del>Postgres’s reliance on TF-IDF for full-text search can struggle with very long documents and rare terms in large collections.</del></p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Postgres actually doesn’t use TF-IDF for full-text search. Its built-in ranking functions (ts_rank and ts_rank_cd) primarily consider term frequency within individual documents and term proximity, but don’t take into account corpus-wide statistics. This approach can still struggle with very long documents and doesn’t inherently account for the rarity of terms across the entire collection.</p>
<p>Make sure to measure before you look into alternative solutions. Chances are, it might not be worth it.</p>
<h2 id="bonus-adding-bm25"><a data-heading-link="" href="#bonus-adding-bm25">Bonus: adding BM25</a></h2>
<p>Unlike Postgres’s FTS, BM25 considers corpus-wide statistics and document length normalization. Here are some of the reaons you might want to use it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better handling of document length variations</li>
<li>Improved relevance for rare terms</li>
<li>Accounts for diminishing returns of term frequency</li>
<li>Industry standard in information retrieval</li>
</ul>
<p>And here are some extensions you can install go get BM25 going:</p>

<h2 id="conclusion"><a data-heading-link="" href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>We’ve covered a lot of ground in this post, from basic full-text search to advanced techniques like fuzzy matching, semantic search, and result boosting. By leveraging Postgres’s powerful features, you can create a robust and flexible search engine tailored to your specific needs.</p>
<p>Postgres might not be the first tool that comes to mind for search, but it gets you really far.</p>
<p>Remember, the key to a great search experience is continuous iteration and fine-tuning. Use the debugging techniques we discussed to understand how your search is performing, and don’t be afraid to adjust weights and parameters based on user feedback and behavior.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2024/08/looming-liability-machines.html">http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2024/08/looming-liability-machines.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41343024">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-5981923076044383114">
<p>As part of our zoom reading group (<a href="https://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2020/03/zoom-distributed-systems-reading-group.html">wow, 4.5 years old now</a>), we discussed a paper that uses LLMs for automatic root cause analysis (RCA) for cloud incidents.</p><p>This was a pretty straightforward application of LLMs. The proposed system employs an LLM to match incoming incidents to incident handlers based on their alert types, predicts the incident's root cause category, and provides an explanatory narrative. The only customization is through prompt-engineering. Since this is a custom domain, I think a more principled and custom-designed &nbsp;machine learning system would be more appropriate rather than adopting LLMs.</p><p>Anyways, the use of LLMs for RCAs spooked me vicerally. I couldn't find the exact words during the paper discussion, but I can articulate this better now. Let me explain.</p><h2>RCA is serious business</h2><p>Root cause analysis (RCA) is the process of identifying the underlying causes of a problem/incident, rather than just addressing its symptoms. One RCA heuristic is asking 5 Why's to push deeper into the cause-effect relationship. RCA should be done in a holistic (systems thinking) manner exploring the causes of a problem in different dimensions such as People, Process, Equipment, Materials, Environment, and Management. Finally, RCAs should consider relationships between the potential causes, as that may illuminate the pathways that lead to the problem.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Leveson">Nancy Leveson</a> is a leading expert in safety engineering. She is known for her work on preventing accidents in complex systems like airplanes and power plants. She developed a method called STAMP (Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes) that looks at how accidents happen due to failures in controlling these systems, not just technical faults or human mistakes. Leveson's approach focuses how different parts interact and influence each other.</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/_ptmjAbacMk?t=2524">The incident analysis Nancy Leveson does</a> for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhopal_disaster">Bhopal disaster</a> is really eye-opening. The pipe washing operation should have been supervised by a second shift operator, but that position had been eliminated due to cost cutting. But why? As the plant lost money, many of the skilled workers left, and they were either not replaced, or replaced by unskilled workers. &nbsp;(Boeing might have succumbed to cost cutting pressures <a href="https://medium.com/javascript-scene/why-cutting-costs-is-expensive-how-9-hour-software-engineers-cost-boeing-billions-b76dbe571957">according to this article from 2019</a>.)</p><h2>My worries about systemic failures</h2><p>So, safety engineering is a whole academic field with a lot of smart experts working on it. On the industry side, a lot of smart experts practice safety enginering, and possess a lot of wisdom. There are specialized go-to people in every big organization for these things. It would be very stupid if management decides that LLMs do a good job for RCA, and the company doesn't need human experts investigating these issues.</p><p>Ok, maybe they won't be that careless, but I am still concerned this may lead to decline in developing new experts. If LLMs are adopted to perform RCA, companies may stop hiring and training new engineers in this crucial skill.&nbsp;</p><p>I bet LLMs would not be able to deep root cause identification as experts could do. Consider the RCA is serious business section again. LLMs would not be able to dive deep, and produce superficial results.</p><p>Furthermore, we should not get fixated on the "root cause" part of RCA. Most safety experts are alergic to the phrase root cause. An incident is often a systemic complex problem stemming from many things. So the analysis part, rather actually performing the analysis part is the more important thing. Through the analysis, the goal is to prevent the recurrence of similar issues, thereby improving processes, enhancing safety.&nbsp;</p><p>If we offload the RCA learning/categorization part to the LLM (whatever that means), we wouldn't be able to make much progress in the enhancing reliability and safety part.</p><p>In sum, I am worried that the use of LLMs for RCA will lead to cost cutting, and this will lead to systemic failures in the mid-long term.&nbsp;</p><h2>My worries about automation surprise</h2><p>Another problem, maybe a short-mid term problem, I can see with using LLMs for doing RCAs is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation_surprise">automation surprise problem</a>.</p><p>Automation surprise occurs when an automated system behaves in an unexpected way, catching users off guard. This often happens because users don't fully understand how the automation works or the range of possible outcomes the system might produce.</p><p>For example, in aviation, pilots might experience automation surprise if an autopilot system suddenly changes the aircraft's behavior due to a mode switch they didn't anticipate. This can lead to confusion, reduced situational awareness, and potentially dangerous situations if the users cannot quickly understand and correct the system's actions.</p><p>This highlights the importance of designing automated systems that are predictable and providing adequate training so users are aware of the system's capabilities and limitations.</p><p>LLMs are prone to hallucination problems. After some initial success with RCA, people might start placing more trust in LLMs and build some automation around their decisions. They would then be in for a big surprise when things go awry, and they can't figure out the problem.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>The major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually turns out to be impossible to get at or repair. -- Douglas Adams</blockquote><h2>Some LLM news from AWS</h2><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andy-jassy-8b1615_one-of-the-most-tedious-but-critical-tasks-activity-7232374162185461760-AdSz">This bit of news is making the rounds</a>. AWS seems to have integrated Amazon Q, their GenAI assistant for software development, into their internal systems and applied it to Java 17 upgrades of their systems: "The average time to upgrade an application to Java 17 plummeted from what’s typically 50 developer-days to just a few hours. We estimate this has saved us the equivalent of 4,500 developer-years of work (yes, that number is crazy but, real)."</p><p>I am fazed that there is not even a single negative comment under this announcement. Could this maybe go wrong?</p><p>When I was at AWS, I saw first-hand the excellent operational culture there. The weekly operational meeting (was that on Wednesday) was really instructional in terms of learning the thought processes of these safety/security/availability expert engineers. The correct mindset to apply here is a paranoid mindset, and to scrutinize everything, and even be wary of success. It would be a shame if this culture erodes due to some early success with using LLMs to update software.</p><p>OK, so let's revisit that question. What could go wrong with LLMs making the upgrade to Java 17? I will speculate, because I don't know much about this problem. I can see some operational problems. If we put people to do this work, maybe while doing this on certain packages, they will notice, "oh shit, we never thought of this problem, but for these type of packages, upgrading them to be Java 17 compliant might open these security problems". We may be losing this opportunity with engineers goin in the field, getting their hands dirty, and discovering certain problematic cases. Another problem I mentioned above is that maybe we are failing to train new engineers for operational challenges.&nbsp;</p><p>I am not suggesting <a href="https://dune.fandom.com/wiki/Butlerian_Jihad">a Butlerian Jihad</a> against LLMs. But I am worried, we are enticed too much by LLMs. Ok, let's use them, but maybe we shouldn't open the fort doors to let them in.&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>Making swim baits. I started carving and paints fishing lures during Covid. It’s easy to knock out something that looks like a lure, but it’s surprisingly nuanced to make something that behaves in the water as you want it to. Mass production is absolutely the correct way to go about this, but - you know - it keeps my hands busy in the evening and I’m improving my carving, airbrushing, weighting/buoyancy, etc with each one.</p>

Also consider that Firefox would no longer be the default browser in most Linux distros, and likely prohibited from official package repositories entirely.</p>

One of the challenges is that validating if the model is learning useful dynamics of the game, so I'm using it as an excuse to learn some reinforcement learning by using the representations generated by the JEPA model to approximate useful Q-values [1]. This method currently has no search so I'm planning on comparing with this paper [2] which achieves GM level chess without any search. Honestly, Im unsure if the full pipeline is stable enough to even converge, but it's fun experimenting.

So I decided to reallocate a portion of my video game time to learning artistic skills. Largely learning to draw with the classic book Drawing On The Right Side Of The Brain, but I've also been making music and video games  and learning 3D modelling in Blender. I'm not good at any of it yet but I'm having a great time.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://spwhitton.name/tech/code/papersway/">https://spwhitton.name/tech/code/papersway/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41341797">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="pagebody" class="page">
<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This is an implementation of PaperWM-like scrollable window management
for Sway/i3wm.
If you like Sway/i3wm’s commitments to stability, avoiding scope creep etc.
but dislike the window management model, papersway might be of interest.</p>

<p>On each workspace, windows are arranged in a row.  By default, two of the
windows in the row are visible at a time, and you can move left and right in
the row to display other windows.  Opening a new window pushes one of the
visible windows off the screen to make room, and closing a window pulls in a
window to fill the space.  You can reorder the windows.</p>

<p>There is a display of the row of workspaces in the bar,
e.g. <tt>&nbsp;‡&nbsp;<b>‡&nbsp;‡</b>&nbsp;‡&nbsp;</tt>.  Here, the focused workspace has four windows,
and the middle two are the ones currently visible.  If the third window has
focus and we open another window, then the second window will be pushed off to
make room, and we will get <tt>&nbsp;‡&nbsp;‡&nbsp;<b>‡&nbsp;‡</b>&nbsp;‡&nbsp;</tt>.  The third window
remains visible, but moves to the left side of the display.</p>

<p>There are commands to change the number of visible windows; toggle <em>monocle
mode</em>, in which the focused window occupies all visible columns; and jump to a
<em>fresh workspace</em>, which means a new, empty workspace occurring immediately
after the currently focused workspace.  E.g. if you have two workspaces,
<tt><b>1</b>&nbsp;2</tt> and you request a fresh workspace, the second workspace
will be renamed out of the way, leaving you with <tt>1&nbsp;<b>2</b>&nbsp;3</tt> and no
windows visible.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QifpqSiNSKA">Video demo</a></p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>You can install papersway and its dependencies from CPAN.</p>

<p>E.g. with cpanminus (available in distro repositories),</p>

<pre><code>% cpanm App::papersway
</code></pre>

<p>and then add <code>$HOME/perl5/bin</code> to your PATH environment variable.</p>

<p>On Debian 13 or later &amp; Ubuntu 24.10 or later, <code>apt-get install papersway</code>.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Usage instructions, including sample key bindings, are maintained in
<a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/App-papersway/view/bin/papersway">papersway(1)</a>.</p>

<p>AMD’s iGPUs have seen plenty of recent success. Handheld gaming devices like Valve’s Steam Deck and Asus’s ROG Ally both use AMD integrated graphics. AMD’s last generation mobile offering, codenamed Phoenix, already did well against Intel and Qualcomm’s competing products. Strix Point, AMD’s latest mobile chip, looks to continue that strong performance. It gets an even larger GPU than before, along with a slight architecture upgrade.</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Generation</td><td>GPU</td><td>CPU</td></tr><tr><td>Strix Point, 2024 (Ryzen AI 9 HX 370)</td><td>8x RDNA 3.5 WGPs</td><td>4x Zen 5 Mobile + 8x Zen 5c Mobile</td></tr><tr><td>Phoenix, 2023 (Ryzen 7 7840HS)</td><td>6x RDNA 3 WGPs</td><td>8x Zen 4</td></tr><tr><td>Rembrandt, 2022 (Ryzen 7 6800HS)</td><td>6x RDNA 2 WGPs</td><td>8x Zen 3</td></tr><tr><td>Van Gogh, 2022 (Steam Deck)</td><td>4x RDNA 2 WGPs</td><td>4x Zen 2</td></tr><tr><td>Cezanne, 2021</td><td>8x Vega CUs</td><td>8x Zen 3</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>We previously covered RDNA 3.5’s architecture changes in a <a href="https://chipsandcheese.com/2024/02/04/amd-rdna-3-5s-llvm-changes/">separate article</a>, so be sure to check that out. The Ryzen AI 9 HX 370’s Radeon 890M is designated GFX1150, which corresponds to the cut down variant of RDNA 3.5 with 128 KB vector register files.</p>
<h3>Acknowledgments</h3>
<p>We would like to thank ASUS for providing a laptop for review.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>GPUs from AMD’s RDNA line are built from Workgroup Processors (WGPs), which vaguely correspond to cores from the CPU world. The Radeon 890M has eight WGPs. AMD used six WGPs in two prior generations of iGPUs, so Strix Point gets a substantial increase in GPU size.</p>

<p>Strix Point’s GPU side memory subsystem remains very similar to the one on Phoenix. WGPs are partitioned into two shader arrays, each with a 256 KB L1 mid-level cache. Each L1 cache instance now serves four WGPs instead of three. The entire iGPU shares a 2 MB L2 cache, and connects to the rest of the chip via four 32 byte per cycle Infinity Fabric ports. Infinity Fabric is AMD’s network-on-chip, and can run at up to 2 GHz on Strix Point. A 4x32B/cycle link may feel like overkill, but it lets Infinity Fabric run at a less aggressive 1.6 GHz while still giving the iGPU access to full LPDDR5 bandwidth. Since a large part of a chip’s power budget can be consumed doing data transfers, running the interconnect at a lower frequency could help save power during graphics workloads.</p>

<p>AMD continues to use a LPDDR5-capable memory controller, with support for up to LPDDR5-7500. Our test device from Asus uses exactly that, providing 120 GB/s of theoretical bandwidth. While Phoenix’s memory controller can support the same speed, the fastest Phoenix memory configuration we tested with was LPDDR5-6400 in the Ryzen Z1 Extreme. Intel’s Meteor Lake does get a similarly high bandwidth LPDDR5-7467 configuration in the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED.</p>
<h2>Cache and Memory Characteristics</h2>
<p>Cache latency on Strix Point’s iGPU is almost exactly a match for its predecessor. Higher clock speeds do put AMD’s latest iGPU ahead by a hair. Compared to Intel’s Meteor Lake, AMD continues to use more cache levels than its competitors. Meteor Lake has a large and fast first level cache, backed by a L2 with twice as much capacity as AMD’s.</p>

<p>DRAM latency has also improved, though the difference between Strix Point and Phoenix again isn’t large. Meteor Lake suffers much higher DRAM access latency from its iGPU.</p>
<p>In AMD tradition, RDNA 3.5 has a scalar memory access path. Testing with scalar accesses doesn’t show any surprises. The scalar path offers lower latency, with AMD’s mid-level L1 matching Meteor Lake’s first level L1. AMD’s 16 KB scalar cache therefore acts like a L0 cache of sorts, even though AMD only applies that designation to the vector cache.</p>

<p>Strix Point’s memory subsystem needs to provide more bandwidth to feed its extra compute, and AMD doesn’t disappoint. First level cache bandwidth scales with WGP count, and is much higher. The mid-level L1 caches get a bit more strain because each instance now serves four WGPs instead of three, but that’s still within the capabilities of AMD’s L1 design, as AMD’s high end 7900 XTX also makes one L1 instance handle four WGPs.</p>

<p>L2 bandwidth continues to be impressive at 1.7 TB/s, though the increase here is minor compared to Phoenix. Meteor Lake has less cache bandwidth across the board, though its larger L2 cache does give it an advantage. Intel’s iGPU L2 has less bandwidth than AMD’s, but 1 TB/s is still nothing to sneeze at.</p>
<p>With LPDDR5-7500, Strix Point gets somewhat better bandwidth than Meteor Lake or Phoenix. It’s a hair behind Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite, which feeds its Adreno GPU with top end LPDDR5X. Stepping back, it’s impressive how moder n iGPUs have comparable bandwidth to low end GDDR5-equipped GPUs of the past. LPDDR has done a lot to enable faster iGPUs.</p>

<p>Valve’s Steam Deck is another notable comparison. Even though it launched two years ago, the Steam Deck is still a current generation product. However, the Steam Deck’s APU is sorely dated, with a small RDNA 2 GPU running at a very low 1.6 GHz clock. 1.6 GHz is well below the efficiency sweet spot on desktop RDNA 2 products.</p>

<p>As a result, Van Gogh has far less cache bandwidth than modern contenders. Adreno X1 is an exception, with very poor cache bandwidth for a current generation iGPU.</p>
<p>Besides the global memory hierarchy backed by DRAM, GPU code can explicitly keep frequently used data in on-chip local memory. Local memory is local to each workgroup in OpenCL, but in exchange offers guaranteed low latency and high bandwidth. AMD implements local memory with a 128 KB Local Data Share (LDS) in each WGP. Total LDS bandwidth is quite high for an integrated GPU, stopping just short of 5 TB/s.</p>

<p>Local memory can also be used to exchange data between a workgroup’s threads. With a thread-to-thread latency test, RDNA 3.5 acts like RDNA 3. There’s little difference between pointer chasing latency within a single thread, and data exchanges between threads. That’s a good thing, because it means RDNA 3.5’s low LDS latency benefits atomics too.</p>

<p>Global memory atomics are more generally applicable because they allow data exchange between any of a kernel’s threads. Latency is higher of course because transfers can’t be kept in a WGP. However, Strix Point’s iGPU manages to improve latency with global memory atomics despite its increased size.</p>
<h2>Compute Throughput</h2>
<p>RDNA 3.5 inherits RDNA 3’s dual issue mechanism, which lets one wavefront start 64 FP operations per cycle. That can be done either with wave64 mode, or dual issue instructions in wave32 mode. Strix Point’s GPU is also scaled up compared to Phoenix’s. As a result, AMD has packed massive compute throughput into an iGPU. The Radeon 890M pushes past 5 TFLOPS, and past 10 TFLOPS if you count a fused multiply-add as two operations. It’s a clear improvement over Phoenix, and often on a different planet compared to the still current generation Steam Deck APU.</p>

<p>With special function operations like inverse square roots, Strix Point has less of a relative advantage because RDNA 3(.5)’s dual issue doesn’t apply. Still, having a bigger and much higher clocking GPU counts for a lot.</p>

<p>Integer operations often show up in games too, and the Radeon 890M is no slouch with those. It’s a stark contrast when compared to what we saw in Qualcomm’s Adreno X1, which generally had poor integer performance. Strix Point does well even with 64-bit integers, which are rarely used in games. GPUs typically do 64-bit integer adds with two 32-bit add-with-carry instructions, and it seems like those instructions execute at full rate here.</p>
<h2>CPU to GPU Bandwidth</h2>
<p>Integrated GPUs like the one on Strix Point are more power and area constrained than their discrete desktop counterparts. But sharing a memory bus with the CPU does come with an advantage when moving data between CPU and GPU memory spaces.</p>

<p>With <code>clEnqueueWriteBuffer</code> or <code>clEnqueueReadBuffer</code>, Strix Point can use its LPDDR5 controller to get nearly 38 GB/s of copy bandwidth. It’s comfortably above the 32 GB/s that a PCIe 4.0 x16 link would offer. AMD also pulls ahead of Meteor Lake with a similarly high bandwidth LPDDR5 configuration, perhaps indicating AMD has better DMA engines.</p>
<h2>Compute: FluidX3D</h2>
<p>FluidX3D simulates fluid behavior. Performance can be highly dependent on memory bandwidth, assuming the GPU in question is able to meet a baseline level of compute performance.</p>

<p>Strix Point’s iGPU does very well, stepping ahead of Phoenix and Meteor Lake’s iGPUs. It also moves ahead of Nvidia’s Pascal based GTX 1050 3 GB, showing the strength of LPDDR5 for latency tolerant GPU workloads. However, gains are minor because the workload is bandwidth bound.</p>
<h2>Cyberpunk 2077</h2>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is a modern DirectX 12 game. At low settings and 1080P resolution, the Radeon 890M turns in a good performance. It clearly steps ahead of Phoenix, already had a solid iGPU.</p>

<p>A larger GPU needs a larger power budget to shine, and Asus’s laptop is able to give it exactly that. Battery discharge rate as measured through HWInfo was around 50W. It’s quite a bit higher than the battery discharge rate on the Meteor Lake, Phoenix, and Snapdragon X Elite laptops tested. But it’s worth it, because AMD does get more FPS per watt than the Snapdragon X Elite.</p>

<p>If Strix Point’s SoC power gets pulled back to 15W for 20-21W of battery draw, average FPS drops to 30 FPS. At that point, AMD’s newest GPU is able to maintain competitive performance with Intel’s Meteor Lake at lower power.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>As the latest installment in AMD’s iGPU journey, the RDNA 3.5 iGPU in Strix Point does its job well. Performance improves compared to AMD’s already solid iGPU in Phoenix. Other than having more GPU cores running at slightly higher clock speeds, Strix Point doesn’t change a lot compared to its predecessor. RDNA 3.5’s improvements are welcome, but they’re minor as expected for a half-generation update. AMD’s GPU-side cache and memory subsystem uses the same strategy as before.</p>
<p>It’s a bit boring considering Intel has a larger L2 cache, and Qualcomm is playing with a 6 MB System Level Cache on their Snapdragon X Elite (of which about 2.5 MB appears usable to the iGPU). But boring might be the best answer here. Phoenix undeniably did well despite having less last level cache than its competitors. Strix Point appears to do the same, comfortably outdoing its competition. AMD is able to feed its iGPU with less caching, and without going for the most expensive LPDDR5X memory around. Making sweeping changes is always risky, as Netburst and AMD’s own Bulldozer have shown. With Strix Point, AMD is not fixing things that aren’t broken.</p>

<p>Strix Point’s move to RDNA 3.5 does show that AMD is focusing harder on the iGPU side than before. Not too long ago, AMD iGPUs would use hilariously out of date graphics architectures. AMD launched the Cezanne chip in 2021 with Vega graphics, which is largely similar to the original GCN architecture that launched in 2011. In 2021, AMD’s desktop discrete GPUs used the RDNA 2 architecture. Longer ago, AMD launched Trinity APUs with Terascale 3 graphics when their desktop GPUs had already moved to GCN.</p>
<p>With Strix Point, AMD’s mobile iGPU has a newer graphics architecture than its desktop counterparts. It’s an unprecedented situation, but not a surprising one. Since the DX11 era, AMD has never been able to take and hold the top spot in the discrete GPU market. Nvidia has been building giant chips where cost is no object for a long time, and they’re good at it. Perhaps AMD sees lower power gaming as a market segment where they can really excel. Strix Point seems to be a reflection of that.</p>
<p>LLVM commits also support a higher end RDNA 3.5 variant, designated GFX1151 and referred to as “Strix Halo”. Of course adding LLVM support does not mean a product is on the way. But it shows AMD is looking very seriously at what they can do with big integrated GPUs. And I look forward to seeing how AMD’s mobile graphics strategy plays out.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>NASA will return Boeing’s Starliner to Earth without astronauts <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/people/barry-butch-e-wilmore/">Butch Wilmore</a> and <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/people/sunita-l-williams/">Suni Williams</a> aboard the spacecraft, the agency announced Saturday. The uncrewed return allows NASA and Boeing to continue gathering testing data on Starliner during its upcoming flight home, while also not accepting more risk than necessary for its crew.</p>
<p>Wilmore and Williams, who flew to the International Space Station in June aboard NASA’s Boeing Crew Flight Test, have been busy supporting station research, maintenance, and Starliner system testing and data analysis, among other activities.</p>
<p>“Spaceflight is risky, even at its safest and most routine. A test flight, by nature, is neither safe, nor routine. The decision to keep Butch and Suni aboard the International Space Station and bring Boeing’s Starliner home uncrewed is the result of our commitment to safety: our core value and our North Star,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. “I’m grateful to both the NASA and Boeing teams for all their incredible and detailed work.”</p>
<p>Wilmore and Williams will continue their work formally as part of the Expedition 71/72 crew through February 2025. They will fly home aboard a Dragon spacecraft with two other crew members assigned to the agency’s SpaceX Crew-9 mission. Starliner is expected to depart from the space station and make a safe, controlled autonomous re-entry and landing in early September.</p>
<p>NASA and Boeing identified helium leaks and experienced issues with the spacecraft reaction control thrusters on <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2024/06/06/boeings-crew-flight-test-on-starliner-docks-to-station/" rel="noopener">June 6</a> as Starliner approached the space station. Since then, engineering teams have completed a <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2024/07/30/nasa-boeing-complete-second-docked-starliner-hot-fire-test/" rel="noopener">significant amount of work</a>, including reviewing a collection of data, conducting flight and ground testing, hosting independent reviews with agency propulsion experts, and developing various return contingency plans. The uncertainty and lack of expert concurrence does not meet the agency’s safety and performance requirements for human spaceflight, thus prompting NASA leadership to move the astronauts to the Crew-9 mission.</p>
<p>“Decisions like this are never easy, but I want to commend our NASA and Boeing teams for their thorough analysis, transparent discussions, and focus on safety during the Crew Flight Test,” said Ken Bowersox, associate administrator for NASA’s Space Operations Mission Directorate. “We’ve learned a lot about the spacecraft during its journey to the station and its docked operations. We also will continue to gather more data about Starliner during the uncrewed return and improve the system for future flights to the space station.”</p>

<p>Starliner is designed to operate autonomously and previously completed two uncrewed flights. NASA and Boeing will work together to adjust end-of-mission planning and Starliner’s systems to set up for the uncrewed return in the coming weeks. Starliner must return to Earth before the Crew-9 mission launches to ensure a docking port is available on station.</p>
<p>“Starliner is a very capable spacecraft and, ultimately, this comes down to needing a higher level of certainty to perform a crewed return,” said Steve Stich, manager of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. “The NASA and Boeing teams have completed a tremendous amount of testing and analysis, and this flight test is providing critical information on Starliner’s performance in space. Our efforts will help prepare for the uncrewed return and will greatly benefit future corrective actions for the spacecraft.”</p>
<p>NASA’s Commercial Crew Program requires spacecraft fly a crewed test flight to prove the system is ready for regular flights to and from the space station. Following Starliner’s return, the agency will review all mission-related data to inform what additional actions are required to meet NASA’s certification requirements.</p>
<p>The agency’s SpaceX Crew-9 mission, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-shares-assignments-for-its-spacex-crew-9-space-station-mission/">originally slated with four crew members</a>, will launch no earlier than Tuesday, Sept. 24. The agency will share more information about the Crew-9 complement when details are finalized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NASA and SpaceX currently are working several items before launch, including reconfiguring seats on the Crew-9 Dragon, and adjusting the manifest to carry additional cargo, personal effects, and Dragon-specific spacesuits for Wilmore and Williams. In addition, NASA and SpaceX now will use new facilities at Space Launch Complex-40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida to launch Crew-9, which provides increased operational flexibility around NASA’s planned <a href="https://europa.nasa.gov/" rel="noopener">Europa Clipper</a> launch.</p>
<p>The Crew-9 mission will be the ninth rotational mission to the space station under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, which works with the American aerospace industry to meet the goal of safe, reliable, and cost-effective transportation to and from the orbital outpost on American-made rockets and spacecraft launching from American soil.</p>
<p>For more than two decades, people have lived and worked continuously aboard the International Space Station, advancing scientific knowledge and demonstrating new technologies, making research breakthroughs not possible on Earth. The station is a critical testbed for NASA to understand and overcome the challenges of long-duration spaceflight and to expand commercial opportunities in low Earth orbit. As commercial companies focus on providing human space transportation services and destinations as part of a robust <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/leo-economy/low-earth-orbit-economy">low Earth orbit economy</a>, NASA’s Artemis campaign is underway at the Moon where the agency is preparing for future human exploration of Mars.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__blog-post-container">
<p>Of all the recent changes coming to ECMAScript, my favorite by far is the <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Temporal proposal</a>. This proposal is very advanced, and we can already use this API through the <a href="https://github.com/fullcalendar/temporal-polyfill" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">polyfill provided by the FullCalendar team</a>.</p>
<p>This API is so incredible that I will likely dedicate several blog posts to highlighting its key features. However, in this first post, I will focus on explaining one of its main advantages: <strong>we finally have a native object to represent a "Zoned Date Time"</strong>.</p>
<p>But... What is a "Zoned Date Time"?</p>

<p>Well, when we talk about <em>human dates</em>, we usually say something like, "I have a doctor's appointment on August 4th, 2024, at 10:30 AM," but we omit the time zone. This omission makes sense because, generally, our interlocutor knows us and understands that when I talk about dates, I usually do so in the context of my time zone, Europe/Madrid.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, with computers, this is not the case. When we work with "Date" objects in JavaScript we are dealing with plain numbers.</p>
<p>If we read the <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/numbers-and-dates.html#sec-time-values-and-time-range" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official specification</a>, it states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"An ECMAScript time value is a Number, either a finite integral Number representing an instant in time to millisecond precision or NaN representing no specific instant"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aside from the VERY IMPORTANT fact that dates in JavaScript are not UTC but POSIX, where leap seconds are completely ignored, the problem with having only numbers is that the original semantics of the date are lost. This is becaus given an human date we can get the equivalent js date but not the other way arround.</p>
<p>Let's consider an example: suppose I want to record the moment I make a payment with my card. Many people might be tempted to do something like this:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>const</span><span> paymentDate </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>Date</span><span>(</span><span>'2024-07-20T10:30:00'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Since my browser is on an <code>CET</code> timezone, when I write this the browser just <em>"computes the number of milliseconds since the EPOX given this CET instant"</em></p>
<p>This is what we actually store in a date:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>paymentDate</span><span>.</span><span>getTime</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>// 1721464200000</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This means that depending on how you read this information you will get a different "human date":</p>
<p>If we read this from the CET perspective I get 10:30:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>d</span><span>.</span><span>toLocaleString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>// '20/07/2024, 10:30:00'</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>and if we read this from the ISO perspective we get 8:30:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>d</span><span>.</span><span>toISOString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>// '2024-07-20T08:30:00.000Z'</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Many people think that by working with UTC or communicating dates in ISO format, they are safe; however, <strong>this is not correct, as information is still lost.</strong></p>

<p>Even when working with dates on an ISO format, including the offset, the next time we want to display that date, we only know the number of milliseconds that have passed since the UNIX epoch and the offset. But this is still not enough to know the human moment and time zone in which the payment was made.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, given a timestamp <code>t0</code>, we can obtain <code>n</code> human-readable dates that represent it...</p>
<!-- -->
<p>In other words, the function responsible for transforming a timestamp into a human-readable date is not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective_function" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">injective</a>, as each element of the set of timestamps corresponds to more than one element of the "human dates" set.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>This happens in exactly the same way when storing ISO dates, as timestamps and ISO are two representations of the same instant:</p>
<!-- -->
<p>And this <strong>also happens if you work with offsets</strong> because different timezones might have the same offset.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>If you still don't see the problem clearly, let me illustrate it with an example. Imagine you live in Madrid and take a trip to Sydney.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, you return to Madrid and see a charge on your transaction statement that you don't recognize... a charge of 3.50 at 2 AM on the 16th? What was I doing? That night I went to bed early!... I don't understand.</p>
<p>After a while of being worried, you realize that the charge corresponds to the coffee you had the following morning since, as you've read this article, you've deduced that your bank stores all transactions in UTC, and the application translates them to the phone's time zone.</p>
<p>This may end up as an anecdote, but what if your bank applies a promotion of one free cash withdrawal per day? When does that day start and end? UTC? Australia?... Things get complicated, believe me...</p>
<p>At this point, I hope you're convinced that working with only timestamps is a problem that, fortunately, now has a solution.</p>

<p>In addition to many other things, the new Temporal API introduces a <a href="https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/zoneddatetime.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Temporal.ZonedDateTime</a> object specifically designed to represent dates and times with their corresponding time zone. They have also proposed an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9557/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extension to RFC 3339</a> to standardize the serialization and deserialization of strings representing dates:</p>
<p><img src="https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/persistence-model.svg" alt="" title="String spec"></p><p>As an example:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>   1996-12-19T16:39:57-08:00[America/Los_Angeles]</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This string represents 39 minutes and 57 seconds after the 16th hour of December 19, 1996, with an offset of -08:00 from UTC, and additionally specifies the human time zone associated with it ("Pacific Time") for time-zone-aware applications to take into account.</p>
<p>Additionally, this API allows working with different calendars such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>buddhist</li>
<li>chinese</li>
<li>coptic</li>
<li>dangi</li>
<li>ethioaa</li>
<li>ethiopic</li>
<li>gregory</li>
<li>hebrew</li>
<li>indian</li>
<li>islamic</li>
<li>islamic-umalqura</li>
<li>islamic-tbla</li>
<li>islamic-civil</li>
<li>islamic-rgsa</li>
<li>japanese</li>
<li>persian</li>
<li>roc</li>
</ul>
<p>Among all these, the most common will be <code>iso8601</code> (the standard adaptation of the Gregorian calendar) with which you will work most frequently.</p>

<p>The Temporal API offers a significant advantage when creating dates, particularly with its Temporal.ZonedDateTime object. One of the standout features is its ability to effortlessly handle time zones, including those tricky situations involving Daylight Saving Time (DST). For example, when you create a Temporal.ZonedDateTime object like this:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>const</span><span> zonedDateTime </span><span>=</span><span> Temporal</span><span>.</span><span>ZonedDateTime</span><span>.</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  year</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>2024</span><span>,</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  month</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>8</span><span>,</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  day</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>16</span><span>,</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  hour</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>12</span><span>,</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  minute</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>30</span><span>,</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  second</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>,</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  timeZone</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'Europe/Madrid'</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>You’re not just setting a date and time; you're ensuring that this date is accurately represented within the specified time zone. This precision means that regardless of DST changes or any other local time adjustments, your date will always reflect the correct moment in time.</p>
<p>This feature is especially powerful when scheduling events or logging actions that need to be consistent across different regions. By incorporating the time zone directly into the date creation process, Temporal eliminates the common pitfalls of working with traditional Date objects, such as unexpected shifts in time due to DST or time zone differences. This makes Temporal not just a convenience but a necessity for modern web development where global time consistency is crucial.</p>

<h4 id="comparing-dates">Comparing dates<a href="#comparing-dates" aria-label="Direct link to Comparing dates" title="Direct link to Comparing dates">​</a></h4>
<p>ZonedDateTime offers an static method named <code>compare</code> which given 2 ZonedDateTimes one and two will return:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>−1</code> if one is less than two</li>
<li><code>0</code> if the two instances describe the same exact instant, ignoring the time zone and calendar</li>
<li><code>1</code> if one is greater than two.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can easily compare dates on unusual cases like the repeated clock hour after DST ends, values that are later in the real world can be earlier in clock time, or vice versa:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>const</span><span> one </span><span>=</span><span> Temporal</span><span>.</span><span>ZonedDateTime</span><span>.</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>'2020-11-01T01:45-07:00[America/Los_Angeles]'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>const</span><span> two </span><span>=</span><span> Temporal</span><span>.</span><span>ZonedDateTime</span><span>.</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>'2020-11-01T01:15-08:00[America/Los_Angeles]'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span>Temporal</span><span>.</span><span>ZonedDateTime</span><span>.</span><span>compare</span><span>(</span><span>one</span><span>,</span><span> two</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>// =&gt; -1</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>// (because `one` is earlier in the real world)</span><br></span></code></pre></div>

<p>A ZonedDateTime has some precomputed attributes that will make your life easier, for example:</p>
<p><strong><code>hoursInDay</code></strong></p>
<p>The hoursInDay read-only property returns the number of real-world hours between the start of the current day (usually midnight) in zonedDateTime.timeZone to the start of the next calendar day in the same time zone.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>Temporal</span><span>.</span><span>ZonedDateTime</span><span>.</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>'2020-01-01T12:00-08:00[America/Los_Angeles]'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>hoursInDay</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>// =&gt; 24</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>// (normal day)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>Temporal</span><span>.</span><span>ZonedDateTime</span><span>.</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>'2020-03-08T12:00-07:00[America/Los_Angeles]'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>hoursInDay</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>// =&gt; 23</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>// (DST starts on this day)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>Temporal</span><span>.</span><span>ZonedDateTime</span><span>.</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>'2020-11-01T12:00-08:00[America/Los_Angeles]'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>hoursInDay</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>// =&gt; 25</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>  </span><span>// (DST ends on this day)</span><br></span></code></pre></div>

<p>ZonedDateTimes offer a <code>.withTimeZone</code> method which allows to change a ZonedDateTime as we desire:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>zdt </span><span>=</span><span> Temporal</span><span>.</span><span>ZonedDateTime</span><span>.</span><span>from</span><span>(</span><span>'1995-12-07T03:24:30+09:00[Asia/Tokyo]'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>zdt</span><span>.</span><span>toString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>// =&gt; '1995-12-07T03:24:30+09:00[Asia/Tokyo]'</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>zdt</span><span>.</span><span>withTimeZone</span><span>(</span><span>'Africa/Accra'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>toString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>// =&gt; '1995-12-06T18:24:30+00:00[Africa/Accra]'</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<h4 id="basic-arithmetics">Basic arithmetics<a href="#basic-arithmetics" aria-label="Direct link to Basic arithmetics" title="Direct link to Basic arithmetics">​</a></h4>
<p>We can use the <code>.add</code> method to add the date portion of a duration using calendar arithmetics. The result will automatically adjust for Daylight Saving Time using the rules of this instance's timeZone field.</p>
<p>The <strong>GREAT PART</strong> of this is that it supports playing with calendar arithmetics or plain durations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding or subtracting days should keep clock time consistent across DST transitions. For example, if you have an appointment on Saturday at 1:00PM and you ask to reschedule it 1 day later, you would expect the reschedule appointment to still be at 1:00PM, even if there was a DST transition overnight.</li>
<li>Adding or subtracting the time portion of a duration should ignore DST transitions. For example, a friend you've asked to meet in in 2 hours will be annoyed if you show up 1 hour or 3 hours later.</li>
<li>There should be a consistent and relatively-unsurprising order of operations. If results are at or near a DST transition, ambiguities should be handled automatically (no crashing) and deterministically.</li>

<p>Temporal offers a method named <code>.until</code> which computes the difference between the two times represented by zonedDateTime and other, optionally rounds it, and returns it as a Temporal.Duration object. If other is earlier than zonedDateTime then the resulting duration will be negative. If using the default options, adding the returned Temporal.Duration to zonedDateTime will yield other.</p>
<p>This might look like an obvious operation but I encourage you to <a href="https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/zoneddatetime.html#until" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read the full spec</a> to understand the nuances of it.</p>

<p>The Temporal API represents a revolutionary shift in how time is handled in JavaScript, making it one of the few languages that address this issue comprehensively. In this article, we've only scratched the surface by discussing the difference between human-readable dates (or wall clock time) and UTC dates, and how the Temporal.ZonedDateTime object can be used to accurately represent the former.</p>
<p>In future articles, we'll explore other fascinating objects such as Instant, PlainDate, and Duration.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed this introduction.</p>
