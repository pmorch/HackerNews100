<i>Written on 2025-11-30 by Rodrigo Arias Mallo</i>
<p>I would like to migrate the Dillo project away from
<a href="https://github.com/dillo-browser/">GitHub</a>
into a new home which is more friendly to be used with Dillo and solves some of
its problems. This page summarizes the current situation with GitHub and why I
decided to move away from it into a self-hosted server with multiple mirrors in
other forges.
</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Before we dive into the details, I would like to briefly mention what
happened with the old site. The original Dillo website was at dillo.org,
which also had the source code of Dillo in a mercurial repository at
hg.dillo.org. But it also included the mail server used to reach the developers,
a bug tracker and archives for the mailing list. However, in 2022
<a href="https://dillo-browser.org/dillo.org.html">the domain was lost</a> and someone else decided to
buy it to put a similar site but plaged with AI generated ads. The original
developers are no longer active, but luckily I had a copy of the mercurial
repository and with some help I was able to recover a lot of material from the
original server (some parts are still missing to this day).
</p><p>
I want to avoid this situation as much as possible, so we cannot rely on a
single site that can go down and the whole project become lost. Initially, I
uploaded the Dillo source and website to git repositories on GitHub, but I no
longer think this is a good idea.
</p><h2>The situation with GitHub</h2>
<p>GitHub has been useful to store all repositories of the Dillo project, as
well as to run the CI workflows for platforms in which I don't have a machine
available (like Windows, Mac OS or some BSDs).

</p><p>However, it has several problems that make it less suitable to develop Dillo
anymore. The most annoying problem is that the frontend barely works without
JavaScript, so we cannot open issues, pull requests, source code or CI logs in
Dillo itself, despite them being mostly plain HTML, which I don't think is
acceptable. In the past, it used to gracefully degrade without enforcing
JavaScript, but now it doesn't. Additionally, the page is very resource hungry,
which I don't think is needed to render mostly static text.

</p><p>Another big problem is that it is a single point of failure. I don't mean
that GitHub is stored in a single machine, but it is controlled by a single
entity which can unilateraly ban our repository or account and we would lose the
ability to notify in that URL what happened. This can cause data loss if we
don't have a local copy of all the data.

</p><p>On the usability side, the platform has become more and more slow over
time, which is affecting the development process. It also requires you to have
a fast Internet connection at all times, which is not the case for me
sometimes. Additionally, GitHub seems to encourage a "push model" in which you
are notified when a new event occurs in your project(s), but I don't want to
work with that model. Instead, I prefer it to work as a "pull model", so I only
get updates when I specifically look for them. This model would also allow me to
easily work offline. Unfortunately, I see that the same push model has been
copied to alternative forges.

</p><p>On the social side, I feel that it doesn't have the right tools to moderate
users, specially for projects where the ratio of non-technical users to
developers is high. This is specially problematic when active issues with
developer notes begin to be filled with comments from users that have never
contributed to the project and usually do more harm than good. This situation
ends up causing burnout in developers.

</p><p>Lastly, GitHub seem to follow the current trend of over-focusing on LLMs and
generative AI, which are destroying the open web (or what remains of it) among
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence#Concerns">other
problems</a>. It has a direct impact on us because sites protect themseves with
a JavaScript wall (or worse, browser fingerprinting) to prevent aggresive LLM
crawler bots from overloading the site, but they also leave Dillo users out. So
I would prefer not to encourage this trend. Despite my intentions, moving Dillo
away won't change much their capability to train their model with our code, but
at least I won't be actively helping.

</p><h2>Self-hosting Dillo</h2>
<p>After researching the available options, it seems that none of the current
forges would allow us to have a redundant system that can prevent the forge from
becoming a single point of failure and solve the rest of the problems with
GitHub. Therefore, I decided to self-host Dillo myself, move all important data
to git repositories and keep them synchronized in multiple git mirrors.

</p><p>I decided to buy the dillo-browser.org domain name and setup a very small
VPS. Initially, I was very skeptical that it would be able to survive on
today's web, but it seems to be doing an acceptable job at handling it (mostly
AI bot traffic masquerading as users). The Dillo website is available here:
</p><p>
<a href="https://dillo-browser.org/">https://dillo-browser.org/</a>

</p><p>I researched which git frontends may suit our needs, and I discovered that
most options are very complicated to self-host and require a lot of server
resources and JavaScript on the frontend. I ended up testing cgit, which is
written in C and it seems to be very lightweight both on RAM and CPU usage.
Furthermore, the web frontend doesn't require JS, so I can use it from Dillo (I
modified cgit CSS slightly to work well on Dillo). It is available on this URL:
</p><p>
<a href="https://git.dillo-browser.org/">https://git.dillo-browser.org/</a>

</p><p>Regarding the bug tracker, I also took a look at the available options. They
are all too complicated for what I would like to have and they seem to
centralize the data into a database that can get lost. This is precisely the
case that happened with the old dillo bug tracker and we are still unable to
recover the original bug entries.

</p><p>To avoid this problem, I created my own bug tracker software,
<a href="https://git.dillo-browser.org/buggy/">buggy</a>, which
is a very simple C tool that parses plain Markdown files and creates a
single HTML page for each bug. All bugs are stored in a
<a href="https://git.dillo-browser.org/bugtracker/">git repository</a>
and a git hook regenerates the bug pages and the index on each new commit. As it
is simply plain text, I can edit the bugs locally and only push them to the
remote when I have Internet back, so it works nice offline. Also, as the output
is just an static HTML site, I don't need to worry about having any
vulnerabilities in my code, as it will only run at build time. You can see it
live here, with the exported issues from GitHub:
</p><p>
<a href="https://bug.dillo-browser.org/">https://bug.dillo-browser.org/</a>

</p><p>The mailing list archives are stored by three independent external services,
but I might include a copy with our own archives in the future.

</p><h2>Setting up mirrors</h2>
<p>As all the important data is now stored in git repositories, we can mirror
them in any forge, without having to rely on their custom storage format for the
issues or other data. If a forge goes down (or goes rogue) we can simply switch
to another site with low switching cost. To this end, I have created git mirrors
in Codeberg and Sourcehut that are synced with our git server:
</p><ul>
  <li><strong>Codeberg</strong>:
    <a href="https://codeberg.org/dillo/">https://codeberg.org/dillo/</a>
  </li><li><strong>Sourcehut</strong>:
    <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~dillo/">https://git.sr.ht/~dillo/</a>
</li></ul>
<p>
However, we still have a single point of failure: the DNS entry of the
dillo-browser.org domain. If we lose the DNS entry (like with dillo.org) it
would cause a problem as all services will be unreachable. We could recover from
such situation by relying on alternative ways to reach users, by the mailing
list, fediverse or IRC, as well as updating the mirrors to reflect the current
situation. It is not ideal, but I don't think it would cause a catastrophic data
loss (like it happened before) as all the data is now stored in git and
replicated across independent locations.

</p><h2>OpenPGP signature</h2>
<p>In order for this page to have some authority, the HTML file is signed with
my <a href="https://dillo-browser.org/news/migration-from-github/rodarima.asc">GPG key</a>
(32E65EC501A1B6FDF8190D293EE6BA977EB2A253), which is the
same that I use to sign the <a href="https://dillo-browser.org/release">last releases</a> of Dillo and is
also listed in <a href="https://github.com/rodarima.gpg">my GitHub user</a>. The
signature <a href="https://dillo-browser.org/news/migration-from-github/index.html.asc">is available here</a> and is linked to the
page with the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag using the <code>rel=signature</code>
relation. You can find more information and how to verify the signature in the
<a href="https://dillo-browser.org/rfc/006-signatures-html/">Dillo RFC-006</a>.

</p><p>Using OpenPGP signatures is robust against losing the DNS entry, as the
authority is not given by the TLS certificate chain but by the trust in the
OpenPGP signature, so we could move the site elsewhere and still claim that is
owned by us. Additionally, as we can store the signatures inside all git
mirrors, they are also resilient against data loss.

</p><h2>Closing remarks</h2>

<p>Keep in mind that the migration process requires several moving parts and it
will take a while for it to stabilize (switching costs). <strong>The GitHub
  repositories won't be removed at any point in time and they will continue to
  be updated until we finish the migration</strong>. When the migration process
is completed, I will mark the Dillo repositories as archived and properly
comunicate it in our site. It is important that we don't remove any commit or
tarball release to avoid breaking downstream builds that still rely on the
GitHub URL.

</p><p>Lastly, I'm glad that we can have our own fully independent and
self-hosted site with relatively low expenses and very little energy cost (which
is good for the environment, but probably not even noticeable at large scale).
With the current DNS and server costs and our current donations I consider that
it is likely that we can continue covering the expenses for at least the next 3
years in the worst case scenario. If you are interested in keeping us afloat,

 - <a href="https://www.ryanliptak.com/blog/categories/windows">Windows</a></p><p>On its own, the title of this post is just a true piece of trivia, verifiable with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/subst">the built-in <code>subst</code> tool</a> (among other methods).</p>
<p>Here's an example creating the drive <code>+:\</code> as an alias for a directory at <code>C:\foo</code>:</p>
<pre><code>subst +: C:\foo
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>+:\</code> drive then works as normal (at least in cmd.exe, this will be discussed more later):</p>
<pre><code>&gt; cd /D +:\

+:\&gt; tree .
Folder PATH listing
Volume serial number is 00000001 12AB:23BC
+:\
└───bar
</code></pre>
<p>However, understanding <em>why</em> it's true elucidates a lot about how Windows works under the hood, and turns up a few curious behaviors.</p>
<h2>What is a drive letter, anyway?<a id="what-is-a-drive-letter-anyway" href="#what-is-a-drive-letter-anyway">🔗</a></h2>
<p>The paths that most people are familiar with are <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file#namespaces">Win32 namespace paths</a>, e.g. something like <code>C:\foo</code> which is a drive-absolute Win32 path. However, the high-level APIs that take Win32 paths like <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilew"><code>CreateFileW</code></a> ultimately will convert a path like <code>C:\foo</code> into a NT namespace path before calling into a lower level API within <code>ntdll.dll</code> like <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winternl/nf-winternl-ntcreatefile"><code>NtCreateFile</code></a>.</p>
<p>This can be confirmed with <a href="https://github.com/rogerorr/NtTrace">NtTrace</a>, where a call to <code>CreateFileW</code> with <code>C:\foo</code> ultimately leads to a call of <code>NtCreateFile</code> with <code>\??\C:\foo</code>:</p>
<pre><code>NtCreateFile( FileHandle=0x40c07ff640 [0xb8], DesiredAccess=SYNCHRONIZE|GENERIC_READ|0x80, ObjectAttributes="\??\C:\foo", IoStatusBlock=0x40c07ff648 [0/1], AllocationSize=null, FileAttributes=0, ShareAccess=7, CreateDisposition=1, CreateOptions=0x4000, EaBuffer=null, EaLength=0 ) =&gt; 0

<p>To run with NtTrace:</p>
<pre><code>nttrace createfilew.exe &gt; createfilew.log
</code></pre>
</details>
<p>That <code>\??\C:\foo</code> is a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file#nt-namespaces">NT namespace path</a>, which is what <code>NtCreateFile</code> expects. To understand this path, though, we need to talk about the Object Manager, which is responsible for handling NT paths.</p>
<h3>The Object Manager<a id="the-object-manager" href="#the-object-manager">🔗</a></h3>

<p>The Object Manager is responsible for keeping track of named objects, which we can explore using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/winobj">the WinObj tool</a>. The <code>\??</code> part of the <code>\??\C:\foo</code> path is actually a special virtual folder within the Object Manager that combines the <code>\GLOBAL??</code> folder and a per-user <code>DosDevices</code> folder together.</p>
<p>For me, the object <code>C:</code> is within <code>\GLOBAL??</code>, and is actually a symbolic link to <code>\Device\HarddiskVolume4</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.ryanliptak.com/images/windows-drive-letters-are-not-limited-to-a-z/cdrive.png">
</p>
<p>So, <code>\??\C:\foo</code> ultimately resolves to <code>\Device\HarddiskVolume4\foo</code>, and then it's up to the actual device to deal with the <code>foo</code> part of the path.</p>
<p>The important thing here, though, is that <code>\??\C:\foo</code> is just <em>one way</em> of referring to the device path <code>\Device\HarddiskVolume4\foo</code>. For example, volumes will also get a named object created using their GUID with the format <code>Volume{18123456-abcd-efab-cdef-1234abcdabcd}</code> that is also a symlink to something like <code>\Device\HarddiskVolume4</code>, so a path like <code>\??\Volume{18123456-abcd-efab-cdef-1234abcdabcd}\foo</code> is effectively equivalent to <code>\??\C:\foo</code>.</p>

<p>All this is to say that there's nothing innately special about the named object <code>C:</code>; the Object Manager treats it just like any other symbolic link and resolves it accordingly.</p>
<h3>So, what <em>is</em> a drive letter, really?<a id="so-what-is-a-drive-letter-really" href="#so-what-is-a-drive-letter-really">🔗</a></h3>
<p>How I see it, drive letters are essentially just a convention borne out of the conversion of a Win32 path into a NT path. In particular, that would be down to the implementation of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/devnotes/rtldospathnametontpathname_u_withstatus"><code>RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U</code></a>.</p>
<p>In other words, since <code>RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U</code> converts <code>C:\foo</code> to <code>\??\C:\foo</code>, then an object named <code>C:</code> will behave like a drive letter. To give an example of what I mean by that: in an alternate universe, <code>RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U</code> could convert the path <code>FOO:\bar</code> to <code>\??\FOO:\bar</code> and then <code>FOO:</code> could behave like a drive letter.</p>
<p>So, getting back to the title, how does <code>RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U</code> treat something like <code>+:\foo</code>? Well, exactly the same as <code>C:\foo</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; paths.exe C:\foo
path type: .DriveAbsolute
  nt path: \??\C:\foo

&gt; paths.exe +:\foo
path type: .DriveAbsolute
  nt path: \??\+:\foo

<p>Therefore, if an object with the name <code>+:</code> is within the virtual folder <code>\??</code>, we can expect the Win32 path <code>+:\</code> to behave like any other drive-absolute path, which is exactly what we see.</p>

<h2>Some exploration of the implications<a id="some-exploration-of-the-implications" href="#some-exploration-of-the-implications">🔗</a></h2>
<p>This section only focuses on a few things that were relevant to what I was working on. I encourage others to investigate the implications of this further if they feel so inclined.</p>
<h3><code>explorer.exe</code> doesn't play ball<a id="explorer-exe-doesn-t-play-ball" href="#explorer-exe-doesn-t-play-ball">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Drives with a drive-letter other than A-Z do not appear in File Explorer, and cannot be navigated to in File Explorer.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.ryanliptak.com/images/windows-drive-letters-are-not-limited-to-a-z/explorer.png">
<i>Error when attempting to navigate to <code>+:\</code> in File Explorer</i>
</p>
<p>For the "do not appear" part, my guess as to what's happening is that <code>explorer.exe</code> is walking <code>\??</code> and looking specifically for objects named <code>A:</code> through <code>Z:</code>. For the "cannot be navigated to" part, that's a bit more mysterious, but my guess is that <code>explorer.exe</code> has a lot of special logic around handling paths typed into the location bar, and part of that restricts drive letters to <code>A</code>-<code>Z</code> (i.e. it's short-circuiting before it ever tries to actually open the path).</p>
<h3>PowerShell doesn't, either<a id="powershell-doesn-t-either" href="#powershell-doesn-t-either">🔗</a></h3>
<p>PowerShell seems to reject non-<code>A</code>-<code>Z</code> drives as well:</p>
<pre><code>PS C:\&gt; cd +:\
cd : Cannot find drive. A drive with the name '+' does not exist.
At line:1 char:1
+ cd +:\
+ ~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (+:String) [Set-Location], DriveNotFoundException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : DriveNotFound,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.SetLocationCommand
</code></pre>
<h3>Non-ASCII drive letters<a id="non-ascii-drive-letters" href="#non-ascii-drive-letters">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Drive letters don't have to be within the ASCII range at all; they can also be non-ASCII characters.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; subst €: C:\foo

&gt; cd /D €:\

€:\&gt; tree .
Folder PATH listing
Volume serial number is 000000DE 12AB:23BC
€:\
└───bar
</code></pre>
<p>Non-ASCII drive letters are even case-insensitive like <code>A</code>-<code>Z</code> are:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; subst Λ: C:\foo

&gt; cd /D λ:\

λ:\&gt; tree .
Folder PATH listing
Volume serial number is 000000DE 12AB:23BC
λ:\
└───bar
</code></pre>
<p>However, drive-letters cannot be <em>arbitrary</em> Unicode graphemes or even arbitrary code points; they are restricted to a single <a href="https://wtf-8.codeberg.page/#motivation">WTF-16</a> code unit (a <code>u16</code>, so &lt;= <code>U+FFFF</code>). The tool that we've been using so far (<code>subst.exe</code>) errors with <code>Invalid parameter</code> if you try to use a drive letter with a code point larger than <code>U+FFFF</code>, but you can get around that by going through the <code>MountPointManager</code> directly:</p>

<p>However, having the symlink in place doesn't solve anything on its own:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; cd /D 𤭢:\
The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.
</code></pre>
<p>This is because there's no way to get the drive-absolute Win32 path <code>𤭢:\</code> to end up as the relevant NT path. As mentioned earlier, the behavior of <code>RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U</code> is what matters, and we can verify that it will not convert a drive-absolute path with a drive letter bigger than <code>U+FFFF</code> to the relevant NT path:</p>
<pre><code>C:\foo&gt; paths.exe 𤭢:\foo
path type: .Relative
  nt path: \??\C:\foo\𤭢:\foo
</code></pre>

<h3>Path classification mismatch<a id="path-classification-mismatch" href="#path-classification-mismatch">🔗</a></h3>
<p>It's very common for path-related functions to be written without the use of system-specific APIs, which means that there's high potential for a mismatch between how <code>RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U</code> treats a file path and how something like a particular implementation of <code>path.isAbsolute</code> treats a file path.</p>
<p>As a random example, Rust only considers paths with <code>A</code>-<code>Z</code> drive letters as absolute:</p>
<pre><code><span>use</span><span> </span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>path</span><span>::</span><span>Path</span><span>;</span><span>

</span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>main</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

    </span><span>println</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>"€:\\ {}"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Path</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"€:\\foo"</span><span>).</span><span>is_absolute</span><span>());</span><span>

<p>Whether or not this represents a problem worth fixing is left as an exercise for the reader (I genuinely don't know if it is a problem), but there's a second wrinkle (hinted at previously) involving text encoding that can make something like an <code>isAbsolute</code> implementation return different results for the same path. This wrinkle is the reason I looked into this whole thing in the first place, as when I was doing <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/25993">some work on Zig's path-related functions recently</a> I realized that looking at <code>path[0]</code>, <code>path[1]</code>, and <code>path[2]</code> for a pattern like <code>C:\</code> will look at different parts of the path depending on the encoding. That is, for something like <code>€:\</code> (which is made up of the code points <code>&lt;U+20AC&gt;&lt;U+003A&gt;&lt;U+005C&gt;</code>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Encoded as WTF-16 where <code>U+20AC</code> can be encoded as the single <code>u16</code> code unit <code>0x20AC</code>, that'd mean <code>path[0]</code> will be <code>0x20AC</code>, <code>path[1]</code> will be <code>0x3A</code> (<code>:</code>), and <code>path[2]</code> will be <code>0x5C</code> (<code>\</code>), which looks like a drive-absolute path</li>
<li>Encoded as <a href="https://wtf-8.codeberg.page/">WTF-8</a> where <code>U+20AC</code> is encoded as three <code>u8</code> code units (<code>0xE2 0x82 0xAC</code>), that'd mean <code>path[0]</code> will be <code>0xE2</code>, <code>path[1]</code> will be <code>0x82</code>, and <code>path[2]</code> will be <code>0xAC</code>, meaning it will look nothing like a drive-absolute path</li>
</ul>
<p>So, to write an implementation that treats paths the same regardless of encoding, <a href="https://codeberg.org/ziglang/zig/src/commit/bfe3317059131ab552f7583b88d6bc82609d198c/lib/std/os/windows.zig#L2564-L2585"><em>some</em> decision has to be made</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If strict compatibility with <code>RtlDetermineDosPathNameType_U</code>/<code>RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U</code> is desired, decode the first code point and check for <code>&lt;= 0xFFFF</code> when dealing with WTF-8 (this is the option I went with for the Zig standard library, but I'm not super happy about it)</li>
<li>If you want to be able to always check <code>path[0]</code>/<code>path[1]</code>/<code>path[2]</code> and don't care about non-ASCII drive letters, check for <code>path[0] &lt;= 0x7F</code> regardless of encoding</li>
<li>If you don't care about anything other than the standard <code>A</code>-<code>Z</code> drive letters, then check for that explicitly (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/3ff30e7eafc1da7104c3960187d17939172428ed/library/std/src/sys/path/windows_prefix.rs#L132-L134">this is what Rust does</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>That's NOT the EURO drive<a id="that-s-not-the-euro-drive" href="#that-s-not-the-euro-drive">🔗</a></h3>

<p>However, when we look at the Object Manager, the <code>€:</code> symlink won't exist... but <code>¬:</code> will:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.ryanliptak.com/images/windows-drive-letters-are-not-limited-to-a-z/notdrive.png">
</p>
<p>My time <a href="https://www.ryanliptak.com/blog/every-rc-exe-bug-quirk-probably/">dealing extensively with Windows quirks</a> made me recognize what might be happening here: <code>0x20AC</code> is likely being truncated to <code>0xAC</code> by <code>SetVolumeMountPointW</code>, and <code>U+00AC</code> happens to be <code>¬</code>. If that is indeed what's going on, it seems pretty strange to truncate the drive letter instead of reject the path, but it also makes sense that non-ASCII drive letters are an edge case that no one has really thought about at all.</p>
<h2>Wrapping up<a id="wrapping-up" href="#wrapping-up">🔗</a></h2>
<p>I have no idea if anything I wrote about here is novel, although my cursory searches didn't turn up much. The only mention of non-<code>A</code>-<code>Z</code> drive letters I'm currently aware of is from the article <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2016/02/the-definitive-guide-on-win32-to-nt.html">The Definitive Guide on Win32 to NT Path Conversion</a> which says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it's natural to assume that drive "letters" can only be A through Z. It turns out the <code>RtlGetFullPathName_U</code> API does not enforce this requirement, although the Explorer shell and command prompt almost certainly do. Therefore as long as the second character of a path is a colon, the conversion will treat it as a Drive Absolute or Drive Relative path. Of course if the DosDevices object directory doesn't have an appropriate symbolic link it's not going to do you much good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, it turns out that the command prompt also doesn't enforce the requirement, and I'd guess that there's at least some more weirdness around this quirk that's waiting to be discovered.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<article>
<p>Hi!  I'm <a href="https://was.tl/">Eric Wastl</a>. I make Advent of Code.  I hope you like it!  I also make <a href="https://was.tl/projects/">lots of other things</a>.  I'm on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/was.tl" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@ericwastl" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/topaz" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p><em>Advent of Code</em> is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar">Advent calendar</a> of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in <a href="https://github.com/search?q=advent+of+code">any</a> programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, <a href="https://gitlab.com/imhoffman/fa19b4-mat3006/wikis/home">university</a> <a href="https://gribblelab.org/teaching/scicomp2021/index.html">coursework</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mrdanielklein/status/936267621468483584">practice</a> <a href="https://comp215.blogs.rice.edu/">problems</a>, a speed contest, or to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/search?q=flair%3Aupping&amp;restrict_sr=on">challenge each other</a>.</p>
<p>You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/7kd8jt/what_would_you_say_are_the_minimal_skills_for/dre0uu3/">problem solving skills</a> will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.</p>
<p>If you'd like to support Advent of Code, you can do so indirectly by helping to  it with others or directly via <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2025/support">AoC++</a>.</p>
<h2>--- General Tips ---</h2>
<p>If you get stuck, try your solution against the <em>examples</em> given in the puzzle; you should get the same answers.  If not, re-read the description.  Did you misunderstand something?  Is your program doing something you don't expect?  After the examples work, if your answer still isn't correct, <em>build some test cases</em> for which you can verify the answer by hand and see if those work with your program.  Make sure you have the entire puzzle input.  If you're still stuck, maybe <em>ask a friend</em> for help, or come back to the puzzle later.  You can also ask for hints in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/" target="_blank">subreddit</a>.</p>
<h2>--- Frequently Asked Questions ---</h2>
<p id="faq_codeselect"><em>Is there an easy way to select entire code blocks?</em> You should be able to triple-click code blocks to select them. You'll need JavaScript enabled.</p><pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env perl
use warnings;
use strict;

print "You can test it out by ";
print "triple-clicking this code.\n";
</code></pre>
<p id="faq_auth"><em>How does authentication work?</em> Advent of Code uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth" target="_blank">OAuth</a> to confirm your identity through other services.  When you log in, you only ever give your credentials to that service - never to Advent of Code.  Then, the service you use tells the Advent of Code servers that you're really you.  In general, this reveals no information about you beyond what is already public; here are examples from <a href="https://api.reddit.com/user/reddit/about" target="_blank">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://api.github.com/users/octocat" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Advent of Code will remember your unique ID, names, URL, and image from the service you use to authenticate.</p>
<p id="faq_difficulty"><em>Why was this puzzle so easy / hard?</em> The difficulty and subject matter varies throughout each event. Very generally, the puzzles get more difficult over time, but your specific skillset will make each puzzle significantly easier or harder for you than someone else. Making puzzles is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/7idn6k/question_why_does_the_difficulty_vary_so_much/dqy08tk/">tricky</a>.</p>
<p id="faq_unlocktime"><em>Why do the puzzles unlock at midnight EST/UTC-5?</em> Because that's when I can consistently be available to make sure everything is working. I also have a family, a day job, and even need sleep occasionally. If you can't participate at midnight, that's not a problem; if you want to race, many people use <a href="https://adventofcode.com/leaderboard/private">private leaderboards</a> to compete with people in their area.</p>
<p id="faq_highcontrast"><em>I find the text on the site hard to read. Is there a high contrast mode?</em> There is a high contrast alternate stylesheet. Firefox supports these by default (View -&gt; Page Style -&gt; High Contrast).</p>
<p id="faq_puzzleideas"><em>I have a puzzle idea! Can I send it to you?</em> Please don't. Because of legal issues like copyright and attribution, I don't accept puzzle ideas, and I won't even read your email if it looks like one just in case I use parts of it by accident.</p>
<p id="faq_puzzlebugs"><em>Did I find a bug with a puzzle?</em> Once a puzzle has been out for even an hour, many people have already solved it; after that point, bugs are very unlikely. Start by asking on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/" target="_blank">subreddit</a>.</p>
<p id="faq_speed"><em>Should I try to get a fast solution time?</em> Maybe. Solving puzzles is hard enough on its own, but trying for a fast time also requires <a href="https://blog.vero.site/post/advent-leaderboard">many</a> <a href="https://kevinyap.ca/2019/12/going-fast-in-advent-of-code/">additional</a> <a href="https://gist.github.com/mcpower/87427528b9ba5cac6f0c679370789661">skills</a> and a lot of practice; speed-solves often look nothing like code that would pass a code review. If that sounds interesting, go for it! However, you should do Advent of Code in a way that is useful to you, and so it is completely fine to choose <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/e2wjhf/comment/f90ksek/">an approach that meets your goals</a> and ignore speed entirely.</p>
<p id="faq_num_days"><em>Why did the number of days per event change?</em> It takes a ton of my free time every year to run Advent of Code, and building the puzzles accounts for the majority of that time. After keeping a consistent schedule for ten years(!), I needed a change. The puzzles still start on December 1st so that the day numbers make sense <span title="Oct 31 = Dec 25">(Day 1 = Dec 1)</span>, and puzzles come out every day (ending mid-December).</p>
<p id="faq_leaderboard"><em>What happened to the global leaderboard?</em> The global leaderboard was one of the largest sources of stress for me, for the infrastructure, and for many users. People took things too seriously, going way outside the spirit of the contest; some people even resorted to things like DDoS attacks. Many people incorrectly concluded that they were somehow worse programmers because their own times didn't compare. What started as a fun feature in 2015 became an ever-growing problem, and so, after ten years of Advent of Code, I removed the global leaderboard. (However, I've made it so you can share a read-only view of your private leaderboard. Please don't use this feature or data to create a "new" global leaderboard.)</p>
<p id="faq_private_leaderboard_rules"><em>While trying to get a fast time on a private leaderboard, may I use AI / watch streamers / check the solution threads / ask a friend for help / etc?</em> If you are a member of any private leaderboards, you should ask the people that run them what their expectations are of their members. If you don't agree with those expectations, you should find a new private leaderboard or start your own! Private leaderboards might have rules like maximum runtime, allowed programming language, what time you can first open the puzzle, what tools you can use, or whether you have to wear a silly hat while working.</p>
<p id="faq_ai"><em>Should I use AI to solve Advent of Code puzzles?</em> No. If you send a friend to the gym on your behalf, would you expect to get stronger? Advent of Code puzzles are designed to be interesting for humans to solve - no consideration is made for whether AI can or cannot solve a puzzle. If you want practice prompting an AI, there are almost certainly better exercises elsewhere designed with that in mind.</p>
<p id="faq_copying"><em>Can I copy/redistribute part of Advent of Code?</em> Please don't. Advent of Code is free to <em>use</em>, not free to copy. If you're posting a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs. If you're making a website, please don't make it look like Advent of Code or name it something similar.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://github.com/SuperAuguste" target="_blank">Auguste Rame</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Techatrix" target="_blank">Techatrix</a> — 30 November 2025</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>For those unfamiliar, Zigtools was founded to support the <a href="https://ziglang.org/" target="_blank">Zig</a> community, especially newcomers, by creating editor tooling such as <a href="https://github.com/zigtools/zls" target="_blank">ZLS</a>, providing building blocks for language servers written in Zig with <a href="https://github.com/zigtools/lsp-kit" target="_blank">lsp-kit</a>, working on tools like the <a href="https://github.com/zigtools/playground" target="_blank">Zigtools Playground</a>, and contributing to Zig editor extensions like <a href="https://codeberg.org/ziglang/vscode-zig" target="_blank">vscode-zig</a>.</p><h2>The Plagiarism</h2><p>A couple weeks ago, a Zig resource called Zigbook was released with a bold claim of “zero AI” and an original “project-based” structure.</p><p>Unfortunately, even a cursory look at the nonsense chapter structure, book content, examples, generic website, or post-backlash issue-disabled repo reveals that the book is wholly LLM slop and the project itself is structured like some sort of sycophantic psy-op, with botted accounts and fake reactions.</p><p>We’re leaving out all direct links to Zigbook to not give them any more SEO traction.</p><p>We thought that the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45947810" target="_blank">broad community backlash</a> would be the end of the project, but Zigbook persevered, releasing just last week a brand new feature, a “high-voltage beta” Zig playground.</p><p>As we at Zigtools have our own Zig playground (<a href="https://github.com/zigtools/playground" target="_blank">repo</a>, <a href="https://playground.zigtools.org/" target="_blank">website</a>), our interest was immediately piqued. The form and functionality looked pretty similar and Zigbook even integrated (in a non-functional manner) ZLS into their playground to provide all the fancy editor bells-and-whistles, like code completions and goto definition.</p><p>Knowing Zigbook’s history of deception, we immediately investigated the WASM blobs. Unfortunately, the WASM blobs are byte-for-byte identical to ours. This cannot be a coincidence given the two blobs (<code>zig.wasm</code>, a lightly modified version of the Zig compiler, and <code>zls.wasm</code>, ZLS with a modified entry point for WASI) are entirely custom-made for the Zigtools Playground.</p><p>We archived the WASM files for your convenience, courtesy of the great Internet Archive:</p><ul><li><code>zls.wasm</code> (<code>sha256sum</code>: <code>3a63e5092e8f90172716977af5c88b4f49e546f730f25e9bafb47f4ac9a2ee1d</code>)<ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251129224054/https://playground.zigtools.org/assets/zls-Dxe5uroE.wasm" target="_blank">Original</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251128234504/https://www.zigbook.net/zig/zls.wasm" target="_blank">Plagiarized</a></li></ul></li><li><code>zig.wasm</code> (<code>sha256sum</code>: <code>d3fe6b8a6b1db84a914eaa1f4a80ca5dcfd3b0948a35f2b1e78432a392eace96</code>)<ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251129224210/https://playground.zigtools.org/assets/zig-n5fT0I4M.wasm" target="_blank">Original</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251128234607/https://www.zigbook.net/zig/zig.wasm" target="_blank">Plagiarized</a></li></ul></li></ul><p>We proceeded to look at the JavaScript code, which we quickly determined was similarly copied, but with LLM distortions, likely to prevent the code from being completely identical. Still, certain sections were copied one-to-one, like the JavaScript worker data-passing structure and logging (<a href="https://github.com/zigtools/playground/blob/0ae8aa03fa38e8ce38e95f57cccfcf9aa4db610a/src/workers/runner.ts#L12-L41" target="_blank">original ZLS playground code</a>, <a href="https://archive.ph/4LZ2X" target="_blank">plagiarized Zigbook code</a>).</p><p>The following code from both files is identical:</p><pre><code>    <span>try</span> <span>{</span>

<p>The <code>\n\n---\nexit with exit code ${exitCode}\n---\n</code> is perhaps the most obviously copied string.</p><p>Funnily enough, despite copying many parts of our code, Zigbook didn’t copy the most important part of the ZLS integration code, the JavaScript ZLS API designed to work with the <a href="https://github.com/zigtools/playground/blob/227bcd3775baeb60cbf2f1ffb1ad0566516a64fc/src/zls.zig" target="_blank">ZLS WASM binary’s API</a>. That JavaScript code is absolutely required to interact with the ZLS binary which they <em>did</em> plagiarize. Zigbook either avoided copying that JavaScript code because they knew it would be too glaringly obvious, because they fundamentally do not understand how the Zigtools Playground works, or because they plan to copy more of our code.</p><p>To be clear, copying our code and WASM blobs is entirely permissible given that the playground and Zig are MIT licensed. Unfortunately, Zigbook has not complied with the terms of the MIT license at all, and seemingly claims the code and blobs as their own without correctly reproducing the license.</p><p>We sent Zigbook a neutral <a href="https://github.com/zigbook/zigbook/pull/43" target="_blank">PR correcting the license violations</a>, but they quickly closed it and deleted the description, seemingly to hide their misdeeds.</p><p>The original description (also available in the “edits” dropdown of the original PR comment) is reproduced below:</p><blockquote><p>We (@zigtools) noticed you were using code from the Zigtools Playground, including byte-by-byte copies of our WASM blobs and excerpts of our JavaScript source code.</p><p>This is a violation of the MIT license that the Zigtools Playground is licensed under alongside a violation of the Zig MIT license (for the zig.wasm blob).</p><p>As the MIT license states:</p><pre><code>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in
all copies or substantial portions of the Software.
</code></pre><p>We’ve fixed this by adding the licenses in question to your repository. As your repository does not include a direct link to the *.wasm dependencies, we’ve added a license disclaimer on the playground page as well that mentions the licenses.</p></blockquote><p>Zigbook’s aforementioned bad behavior and their continued violation of our license and unwillingness to fix the violation motivated us to write this blog post.</p><h2>Our Vision for the Zigtools Playground</h2><p>It’s sad that our first blog post is about the plagiarism of our coolest subproject. We challenged ourselves by creating a WASM-based client-side playground to enable offline usage, code privacy, and no server costs.</p><p>This incident has motivated us to invest more time into our playground and has generated a couple of ideas:</p><ul><li>We’d like to enable multifile support to allow more complex Zig projects to be run in the browser</li><li>We’d like to collaborate with fellow Ziguanas to integrate the playground into their excellent Zig tutorials, books, and blogposts<ul><li>A perfect example usecase would be enabling folks to hop into <a href="https://codeberg.org/ziglings/exercises" target="_blank">Ziglings</a> online with the playground</li><li>The Zig website itself would be a great target as well!</li></ul></li><li>We’d like to support stack traces using DWARF debug info which is not yet emitted by the self-hosted Zig compiler</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>As Zig community members, <strong>we advise all other members of the Zig community to steer clear of Zigbook</strong>.</p><p>If you’re looking to learn Zig, we strongly recommend looking at the excellent official <a href="https://ziglang.org/learn/" target="_blank">Zig learn page</a> which contains excellent resources from the previously mentioned <a href="https://codeberg.org/ziglings/exercises" target="_blank">Ziglings</a> to <a href="https://www.openmymind.net/learning_zig/" target="_blank">Karl Seguin’s Learning Zig</a>.</p><p>We’re also using this opportunity to mention that we’re fundraising to keep ZLS sustainable for our only full-time maintainer, Techatrix. We’d be thrilled if you’d be willing to give just $5 a month. You can check out our <a href="https://opencollective.com/zigtools" target="_blank">OpenCollective</a> or <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/zigtools" target="_blank">GitHub Sponsors</a>.</p><p>Thanks for reading! \(^-^)/</p></div></div>]]></description>

I'd like to impart some lessons.</p><p>1. A small number of accomplishments really mean something, but you often won't know which ones. I started three companies and two were successes, and even though they comprised more than two decades of my life, I feel like I remember a grand total of six important hours between them. Meanwhile, I still remember the shed I built for my father in the first summer after college. Whatever seems unimportant, you will care about the most.</p><p>2. The thing you do today, you will probably do tomorrow. I've wasted a lot of time, but most people I know have wasted lots of time, and it's because of the tendency to make an exception of the present day, which either excuses laziness or pathological busyness, which is a form of the same thing. "I'll do it tomorrow." But tomorrow it will be today. It's always today.</p><p>3. Ethics matter. I don't believe there's any life after this one, but I find myself ruminating on what I've done. In 2015, I had a lot of interaction with a startup incubator you know well, and ended up sitting in the discussions and planning around banning and erasing a young programmer we considered a threat to our financial interests, due to his concerns about authoritarianism in technology. In retrospect, he was harmless, but an example had to be made. The decision was made to ban him here, try to get him fired though I don't know if we succeeded, and attack him with sockpuppets on Reddit, and it seems to have worked because you don't hear his name much.</p><p>Ten years later, I'm still stuck thinking about this. Am I the kind of person who does shitty things? I was. Am I still? How would I even know?</p><p>I don't believe that faith is an out, or that you can apologize or donate your way out of past behaviors. You will always be the person who has done what you have done.</p><p>4. Be kind to animals. There are few joys like having a dog. I always refused when my ex-wife wanted one, and she got one after we separated. For her, it was probably an upgrade.</p><p>5. I developed a knack for founding companies, but I never learned how to build communities. They aren't the same thing. You might have three hundred people at your company and you truly feel like they are your village, but they're not. Circumstances will change, and people will move, and in five years, most of them will not remember your name.</p><p>That's probably enough for now. My mind goes between periods of racing and long spells of languid acceptance. All humans end up in the place where I am, and I hope you reach it with fewer regrets than I have.</p></div></td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr></tbody></table><br>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In short: I maintain a sorta-popular open source package, and I want to prevent big corporations and “bad guys” from using it. I want feedback on how to do this.</p><h2 id="open-source-and-exploitation">Open source and exploitation</h2><p>I’ve been learning more about open source sustainability. More accurately, I’ve been learning more about how open source is exploited by large companies.</p><p>Some recent links that have influenced my view:</p><ul><li><a href="https://mastodon.social/@bagder/115025727082593712">This pair of slides from the maintainer of curl.</a> The first slide: 38 massive car brands that use curl. The second slide: 0 of them give anything back.</li><li><a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=65230">“The Value of Open Source Software”</a> says that “firms would need to spend 3.5 times more […] if OSS did not exist”, and that OSS is giving businesses about $12,000,000,000,000 USD (12 trillion dollars) <em>for free</em>.</li><li><a href="https://werd.io/what-is-open-source/">“What is open source?”</a> says that “volunteers are creating software for free that largely benefits large corporations.”</li><li><a href="https://blog.muni.town/open-source-power/">“Open Source Power”</a> asserts that open source software needs to be more thoughtful about how it donates its work to the commons, because it’s being abused.</li><li><a href="https://itsfoss.com/news/open-source-developers-are-exhausted/">“Open Source Developers Are Exhausted, Unpaid, and Ready to Walk Away”</a> argues that open source maintainers are being exploited and are burning out. That’s dangerous for the industry.</li><li><a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-ai-technology-737bc17af7b03e98c29cec4e15d0f108">“How US tech giants’ AI is changing the face of warfare in Gaza and Lebanon”</a> made me think about how open source tools like PyTorch kill innocent people, if indirectly.</li><li><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=WsbUzGailCw">“The Death of Consequences”</a> claims that “extractive organizations will not take licensing seriously”, and that the open source movement needs more teeth.</li></ul><p>Overall, these ideas lead me to believe that the open source movement needs to see itself as in a larger social context. Can we shift the balance of power away from massive companies and their massive harms? Can we prevent Nazis from using our software? Should we even try?</p><h2 id="what-can-i-do-to-help">What can I do to help?</h2><p>I maintain a <em>sorta-popular</em> open source package. I say <em>popular</em> because it had <a href="https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=helmet&amp;from=2025-01-01&amp;to=2025-12-31">over 200 million downloads in 2025</a> which I believe puts it in the <a href="https://packages.ecosyste.ms/registries/npmjs.org/packages/helmet">top 0.1% of downloads on npm</a>. I say <em>sorta-popular</em> because it’s not very well-known; it sits quietly in thousands (millions?) of projects, with most developers not thinking much about it. I’m not as powerful as Linus Torvalds at the helm of Linux, but I’m also not totally unknown.</p><p><em>But what can I do to help?</em></p><p>I know my goal: <strong>shift the default in open source from “it’s free for anyone to use” to “please don’t use this if you’re evil”.</strong> I don’t just want to do this for my little project; I want to slowly change the discourse. I’m not sure how to do that effectively, if it’s even possible.</p><p>Anyone have any ideas? <em>If you maintained a sorta-popular open source package, what would you do to help?</em></p><p>Some specific questions I have:</p><ul><li>How can I <strong>bring more attention to this issue</strong> given the relative popularity of my project? Do I write a blog post? A callout in the documentation?</li><li>Should I <strong>change my project’s license</strong>? It currently uses the permissive <a href="https://opensource.org/license/MIT">MIT License</a>. I remain unconvinced at the societal value of “freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose”, often called <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html#four-freedoms">freedom 0</a>. I don’t want to donate my work to the bad guys!</li><li>Would <strong>collective action</strong> be more powerful? If so, would other maintainers participate?</li><li>Should I “test” this with some of my <strong>less popular projects</strong>?</li></ul><p>I would love your ideas.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="anchor-46ad49">Americans have grown sour on one of the longtime key ingredients of the American dream.</p><p id="anchor-21cce4">Almost two-thirds of registered voters say that a four-year college degree isn’t worth the cost, according to a new <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26310998-nbc-news-october-2025-poll/" target="_blank">NBC News poll</a>, a dramatic decline over the last decade.</p><p id="anchor-f810a7">Just 33% agree a four-year college degree is “worth the cost because people have a better chance to get a good job and earn more money over their lifetime,” while 63% agree more with the concept that it’s “not worth the cost because people often graduate without specific job skills and with a large amount of debt to pay off.”</p><p id="anchor-628a42">In 2017, U.S. adults surveyed were virtually split on the question — 49% said a degree was worth the cost and 47% said it wasn’t. When CNBC asked the same question in 2013 as part of its All American Economic Survey, 53% said a degree was worth it and 40% said it was not.</p><p id="anchor-86586a">The eye-popping shift over the last 12 years comes against the backdrop of several major trends shaping the job market and the education world, from exploding college tuition prices to rapid changes in the modern economy — which seems once again poised for radical transformation alongside advances in AI.</p><p id="anchor-20699a">“It’s just remarkable to see attitudes on any issue shift this dramatically, and particularly on a central tenet of the American dream, which is a college degree. Americans used to view a college degree as aspirational — it provided an opportunity for a better life. And now that promise is really in doubt,” said Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted the poll along with the Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies.</p><p id="anchor-d693f1">“What is really surprising about it is that everybody has moved. It’s not just people who don’t have a college degree,” Horwitt added.</p><p id="anchor-9e5b5b">National <a href="https://www.bls.gov/emp/chart-unemployment-earnings-education.htm" target="_blank">data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> shows that those with advanced degrees earn more and have lower unemployment rates than those with lower levels of education. That’s been true for years.</p><p id="anchor-5cfa48">But what has shifted is the price of college. While there have been some small declines in tuition prices over the last decade, when adjusted for inflation, <a href="https://research.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/Trends-in-College-Pricing-and-Student-Aid-2025-final_0.pdf" target="_blank">College Board data shows</a> that the average, inflation-adjusted cost of public four-year college tuition for in-state students has doubled since 1995. Tuition at private, four-year colleges is up 75% over the same period.</p><p id="anchor-8c8a8a">Poll respondents who spoke with NBC News all emphasized those rising costs as a major reason why the value of a four-year degree has been undercut.</p><p id="anchor-3853e4">Jacob Kennedy, a 28-year-old server and bartender living in Detroit, told NBC News that while he believes “an educated populace is the most important thing for a country to have,” if people can’t use those degrees because of the debt they’re carrying, it undercuts the value.</p><p id="anchor-f78999">Kennedy, who has a two-year degree, reflected on “the number of people who I’ve met working in the service industry who have four-year degrees and then within a year of graduating immediately quit their ‘grown-up jobs’ to go back to the jobs they had.”</p><p id="anchor-c9c32a">“The cost overwhelms the value,” he continued. “You go to school with all that student debt — the jobs you get out of college don’t pay that debt, so you have to go find something else that can pay that debt.”</p><p id="anchor-eaa980">The 20-point decline over the last 12 years among those who say a degree is worth it — from 53% in 2013 to 33% now — is reflected across virtually every demographic group. But the shift in sentiment is especially striking among Republicans.</p><p id="anchor-3f0f4d">In 2013, 55% of Republicans called a college degree worth it, while 38% said it wasn’t worth it. In the new poll, just 22% of Republicans say the four-year degree is worth it, while 74% say it’s not.</p><p id="anchor-388362">Democrats have seen a significant shift too, but not to the same extent — a decline from 61% who said a degree was worth it in 2013 to 47% this year.</p><p id="anchor-38b2b0"><a href="https://catalist.us/wh-national/" target="_blank">Over the same period</a>, the composition of both parties has changed, with the Republican Party garnering new and deeper support from voters without college degrees, while the Democratic Party drew in more degree-holders.</p><p id="anchor-a6d7dc">Remarkably, less than half of voters with college degrees see those degrees as worth the cost: 46% now, down from 63% in 2013.</p><p id="anchor-5eb933">Those without a college degree were about split on the question in 2013. Now, 71% say a four-year degree is not worth the cost, while 26% say it is.</p><p id="anchor-6dec9e">Preston Cooper, a senior fellow at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said enough cracks have proliferated under the long-standing narrative that a college degree always pays off to create a serious rupture.</p><p id="anchor-0c81e4">“Some people drop out, or sometimes people end up with a degree that is not worth a whole lot in the labor market, and sometimes people pay way too much for a degree relative to the value of what that credential is,” he said. “These cases have created enough exceptions to the rule that a bachelor’s degree always pays off, so that people are now more skeptical.”</p><p id="anchor-103baf">The upshot is that interest in technical, vocational and two-year degree programs has soared.</p><p id="anchor-47f9a3">“I think students are more wary about taking on the risk of a four-year or even a two-year degree,” he said. “They’re now more interested in any pathway that can get them into the labor force more quickly.”</p><p id="anchor-2f0c4e">Josiah Garcia, a 24-year-old in Virginia, said he recently enrolled in a program to receive a four-year engineering degree after working as an electrician’s apprentice. He said he was motivated to go back to school because he saw the degree as having a direct effect on his future earning potential.</p><p id="anchor-603e73">But he added that he didn’t feel that those who sought other degrees in areas like art or theater could say the same.</p><p id="anchor-df4664">“A lot of my friends who went to school for art or dance didn’t get the job they thought they could get after graduating,” he said, arguing that degrees for “softer skills” should be cheaper than those in STEM fields.</p><p id="anchor-550c9a">Jessica Burns, a 38-year-old Iowa resident and bachelor’s degree-holder who works for an insurance company, told NBC News that for her, the worth of a four-year-degree largely depends on the cost.</p><p id="anchor-96ad64">She went to a community college and then a state school to earn her degree, so she said she graduated without having to spend an “insane” amount of money.</p><p id="anchor-ae8558">But her husband went to a private college for his degree, and she quipped: “We are going to have student loan debt for him forever.”</p><p id="anchor-7f91f2">Burns said she believes a college degree is “essential for a lot of jobs. You’re not going to get an interview if you don’t have a four-year degree for a lot of jobs in my field.”</p><p id="anchor-9e7cff">But she framed the value of degrees more in terms of how society views them instead of intrinsic value.</p><p id="anchor-125272">“It’s not valuable because it’s brought a bunch of value added, it’s valuable because it’s the key to even getting in the door,” she said. “Our society needs to figure out that if we value it, we need to make it affordable.”</p><p id="anchor-fb8a5b">Burns said she believes that a lot more people in her millennial generation are “now saddled with a huge amount of debt, even as successful business professionals,” which will influence how her peers approach paying for college for their children.</p><p id="anchor-4d8602">There hasn’t just been a decline in the cost-benefit analysis of a degree. <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/692519/public-trust-higher-rises-recent-low.aspx" target="_blank">Gallup polling also shows</a> a marked decline in public confidence in higher education over the last decade, albeit with a slight increase over the last year.</p><p id="anchor-145a1d">“This is a political problem. It’s also a real problem for higher education. Colleges and universities have lost that connection they’ve had with a large swath of the American people based on affordability,” Horwitt said. “They’re now seen as out of touch and not accessible to many Americans.”</p><p id="anchor-941684"><em>The NBC News poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters Oct. 24-28 via a mix of telephone interviews and an online survey sent via text message.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.prizrak.me/post/landlock/">https://blog.prizrak.me/post/landlock/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46090969">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="landlock-what-is-it">Landlock: What Is It?</h3>
<p>Landlock is a Linux API that lets applications explicitly declare which resources they are allowed to access. Its philosophy is similar to OpenBSD’s <code>unveil()</code> and (less so) <code>pledge()</code>: programs can make a contract with the kernel stating, “I only need these files or resources — deny me everything else if I’m compromised.”</p>
<p>It provides a simple, developer-friendly way to add defense-in-depth to applications. Compared to traditional Linux security mechanisms, Landlock is vastly easier to understand and integrate.</p>
<p>This post is meant to be an accessible introduction, and hopefully persuade you to give Landlock a try.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="how-does-it-work">How Does It Work?</h3>
<p>Landlock is a Linux Security Module (LSM) available since Linux 5.13. Unlike MAC frameworks such as SELinux or AppArmor, Landlock applies <em>transient</em> restrictions: policies are created at runtime, enforced on the current thread and its future descendants, and disappear when the process exits.</p>
<p>You don’t tag files with labels or extended attributes. Instead, applications create policies dynamically.</p>
<p>A Landlock policy consists of two pieces:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Handled accesses</strong> — the categories of operations you want to restrict (e.g., filesystem read/write).</li>
<li><strong>Access grants</strong> — an explicit allowlist of which objects are permitted for those operations.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, you could create a policy that handles all filesystem reads/writes and network binds, and grants:</p>
<ul>
<li>read-only access to <code>/home/user</code></li>
<li>read/write access to <code>/tmp</code></li>
<li>permission to bind to port <code>2222</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The application then calls <code>landlock_restrict_self()</code> to enter the restricted domain. From that point on, that thread’s child threads and child processes are permanently constrained. Restrictions cannot be revoked.</p>
<p>Policies can be layered (up to 16 layers). A child layer may further <em>reduce</em> access, but cannot reintroduce permissions the parent layer removed. For example, a child thread may add a layer to this policy to restrict itself to only reading <code>/home/user</code>, but it cannot regain permission to bind to port <code>2222</code> once a layer omits this grant.</p>
<p>Landlock is unprivileged — any application can sandbox itself. It also uses ABI versioning, allowing programs to apply best-effort sandboxing even on older kernels lacking newer features.</p>
<p>It’s also a stackable LSM, meaning you can combine it with selinux or apparmor in a supplemental layer.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="why-should-you-use-it">Why Should You Use It?</h3>
<p>Landlock shines when an application has a predictable set of files or directories it needs. For example, a web server could restrict itself to accessing only <code>/var/www/html</code> and <code>/tmp</code>.</p>
<p>Unlike SELinux or AppArmor, Landlock policies don’t require administrator involvement or system-wide configuration. Developers can embed policies directly in application code, making sandboxing a natural part of the development process.</p>
<p>Because Landlock requires <em>no privileges</em> to use, adding it to most programs is straightforward.</p>
<p>Bindings exist for languages such as Rust, Go, and Haskell, and several projects provide user-friendly <code>unveil</code>-style wrappers.</p>
<p>A official c library doesn’t exist yet unfortunately, but there’s several out there you can try.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick rust example:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>use</span> landlock::{
</span></span><span><span>    <span>ABI</span>, Access, AccessFs, Ruleset, RulesetAttr, RulesetCreatedAttr, RulesetStatus, RulesetError,
</span></span><span><span>    path_beneath_rules,
</span></span><span><span>};
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>fn</span> <span>restrict_thread</span>() -&gt; Result<span>&lt;</span>(), RulesetError<span>&gt;</span> {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>let</span> abi <span>=</span> <span>ABI</span>::V1;
</span></span><span><span>    <span>let</span> status <span>=</span> Ruleset::default()
</span></span><span><span>        .handle_access(AccessFs::from_all(abi))<span>?</span>
</span></span><span><span>        .create()<span>?</span>
</span></span><span><span>        <span>// Read-only access to /usr, /etc and /dev.
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>        .add_rules(path_beneath_rules(<span>&amp;</span>[<span>"/usr"</span>, <span>"/etc"</span>, <span>"/dev"</span>], AccessFs::from_read(abi)))<span>?</span>
</span></span><span><span>        <span>// Read-write access to /home and /tmp.
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>        .add_rules(path_beneath_rules(<span>&amp;</span>[<span>"/home"</span>, <span>"/tmp"</span>], AccessFs::from_all(abi)))<span>?</span>
</span></span><span><span>        .restrict_self()<span>?</span>;
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>match</span> status.ruleset {
</span></span><span><span>        RulesetStatus::FullyEnforced <span>=&gt;</span> <span>println!</span>(<span>"Fully sandboxed."</span>),
</span></span><span><span>        RulesetStatus::PartiallyEnforced <span>=&gt;</span> <span>println!</span>(<span>"Partially sandboxed."</span>),
</span></span><span><span>        RulesetStatus::NotEnforced <span>=&gt;</span> <span>println!</span>(<span>"Not sandboxed! Please update your kernel."</span>),
</span></span><span><span>    }
</span></span><span><span>    Ok(())
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><hr>
<h3 id="the-state-of-linux-sandboxing-why-this-matters">The State of Linux Sandboxing: Why This Matters</h3>
<p>As Linux adoption grows, so does the amount of malware targeting desktop users. While Linux has historically enjoyed relative safety, this is largely due to smaller market share and higher technical barriers compared to Windows — not because Linux is inherently safer.</p>
<p>Linux is not a security panacea. For example, on most major distributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users can download and execute untrusted binaries with no warnings.</li>
<li>Shell scripts can be piped from the internet and executed blindly.</li>
<li>Many users run passwordless sudo, giving them root access on demand.</li>
<li>Unprivileged applications can typically:
<ul>
<li>Read <code>~/.ssh</code>, <code>~/.bashrc</code>, browser cookies, and anything else in <code>$HOME</code></li>
<li>Modify environment variables and <code>$PATH</code></li>
<li>Create systemd user services</li>
<li>(on X11) log keystrokes and read input devices</li>
<li>Bind to arbitrary network ports</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Several tools try to improve the state of security on linux, but each has significant drawbacks:</p>
<h4 id="containerization-docker-podman">Containerization (docker, podman)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Designed for service isolation, not desktop apps.</li>
<li>Managing home directory access is clunky.</li>
<li>Many users break isolation by using <code>--privileged</code> or <code>--network host</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="flatpak--snap">Flatpak / Snap</h4>
<ul>
<li>Great for graphical applications (Flatpak especially).</li>
<li>Often require overly broad permissions.</li>
<li>Less suitable for CLI tools.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="firejail">Firejail</h4>
<ul>
<li>Requires per-application profiles.</li>
<li>Must be explicitly invoked each time, or you need a wrapper script.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the developer side:</p>
<h4 id="seccomp">seccomp</h4>
<ul>
<li>Powerful syscall filtering.</li>
<li>Tedious and error-prone to configure.</li>
<li>Blacklists are fragile; new syscalls can break things.</li>
<li>Argument filtering is difficult and full of TOCTOU hazards.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="selinux">SELinux</h4>
<ul>
<li>Extremely powerful, but difficult to understand.</li>
<li>Requires system-wide policies and admin involvement.</li>
<li>Many users disable it due to complexity.</li>
<li>Not enabled on most distributions by default. (used a lot in android)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="apparmor">AppArmor</h4>
<ul>
<li>Easier than SELinux, but still requires admin-defined profiles.</li>
<li>Applies system-wide and lacks per-process namespacing.</li>
<li>Gets disabled by many distributions, but is more commonly used in the desktop.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="landlock">Landlock</h4>
<ul>
<li>Unprivileged</li>
<li>Application-centric</li>
<li>Easy to integrate</li>
<li>Deny-by-default</li>
<li>Widely supported since 5.13</li>
<li>Backward and forward compatibility mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Landlock isn’t perfect, but it fills a major gap: a simple, self-contained unprivileged sandboxing tool.</p>
<h3 id="what-landlock-could-bring-to-the-table">What landlock could bring to the table:</h3>
<p>Long-running system daemons that run with elevated privileges could benefit from landlock restrictions.</p>
<p>Desktop applications dealing with binary formats, like pdf readers, image viewers web browsers, and word processors can be
restricted to accessing the files they originally opened.</p>
<p>FTP and HTTP servers can be bound to the files they need. Even if nginx is running as root, if an attacker gets a
full reverse shell, they won’t be able to see access files outside the policy.</p>
<p>If the supervisor proposal gets added, we could bring an android-like permissions system to the linux desktop. Flatpak does a
decent job at this, but imagine if every process in your desktop would need to explicitly ask (at least once) before accessing
sensitive files or resources.</p>
<p>Pair that with an accessible GUI and a system for handling updates and saving permission grants, and we have potential for
a safer, more secure linux user experience on the desktop.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="ongoing-work-in-landlock">Ongoing Work in Landlock</h3>
<p>Several promising features are under active development:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://marc.info/?l=linux-fsdevel&amp;m=174105064226536&amp;w=2"><strong>Supervise Mode</strong></a><br>
Lets a userspace “supervisor” interactively allow or deny access — similar to Android-style permission prompts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/landlock-lsm/linux/issues/6"><strong>Socket Restrictions</strong></a>
Fine-grained control over which types of sockets or ports processes may use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250221184417.27954-2-gnoack3000@gmail.com/"><strong>LANDLOCK_RESTRICT_SELF_TSYNC</strong></a>
Ensures restrictions propagate to all threads in a process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-security-module/cover.1763931318.git.m@maowtm.org/T/#t"><strong>LANDLOCK_ADD_RULE_QUIET</strong></a>
Allows suppressing audit messages for certain objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-security-module/20251126122039.3832162-1-utilityemal77@gmail.com/T/#t"><strong>LANDLOCK_ADD_RULE_NO_INHERIT</strong> <em>(disclosure: this is my patch series)</em></a>
Prevents rules from unintentionally inheriting permissions from parent directories, giving finer-grained filesystem control.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 id="tldr">TL;DR</h3>
<p>Landlock is a simple, unprivileged, deny-by-default sandboxing mechanism for Linux.<br>
It’s easy to understand, easy to integrate, and has tremendous potential for improving desktop and application security.</p>
<p>Give it a try in your application.</p>

                                                            <p><span>In theory, Chat Control should have been buried last month. The EU’s ominous plan to mass-scan citizens’ private messages was met with overwhelming public resistance in Germany, with the country’s government refusing to approve it. But Brussels rarely retreats merely because the public demands it. And so, true to form, a reworked version of the text is already being pushed forward — this time out of sight, behind closed doors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Chat Control, formally known as the Child Sexual Abuse Regulation, was first proposed by the European Commission in 2022. The original plan would have made it mandatory for email and messenger providers to scan private, even encrypted, communications — with the purported aim of detecting child sexual abuse material.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The tool was sold as a noble crusade against some of the world’s most horrific crimes. But critics argued that the tool risked becoming a blueprint for generalised surveillance, by essentially giving states and EU institutions the ability to scan every private message. Indeed, a </span><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12726-Child-sexual-abuse-online-detection-removal-and-reporting-/public-consultation_en"><span>public consultation</span></a><span> preceding the proposal revealed that a majority of respondents opposed such obligations, with over 80% explicitly rejecting its application to end-to-end encrypted communications.</span></p>
<p><span>Yet despite repeated blockages, and widespread criticism for violating privacy and fundamental rights, the text was never abandoned. Instead, it was repackaged, and continually pushed forward from one Council presidency to the next. Each time democratic resistance stopped the original plan, it kept returning in new forms, under new labels, each time dressed up as a “necessary” and “urgent” tool to protect children online, yet always preserving its core logic: normalising government-mandated monitoring of private communications on an unprecedented scale.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>“The tool was sold as a noble crusade against some of the world’s most horrific crimes.”</p>
<p><span>In May, the European Commission once again presented its proposal. Yet several states objected. That included Germany, but also Poland, Austria and the Netherlands. As a result, Denmark, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the European Council, immediately began drafting a new version, known as “Chat Control 2.0” and unveiled earlier this month, which removed the requirement for general monitoring of private chats; the searches would now remain formally voluntary for providers. All this happened under the auspices of Coreper, the Committee of Permanent Representatives — one of the most powerful, but least visible, institutions in the EU decision-making process. It is where most EU legislation is actually negotiated; if Coreper agrees on a legislative file, member states almost always rubber-stamp it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The gamble worked. Yesterday, this revised version was quietly greenlit by Coreper, essentially paving the way for the text’s adoption by the Council, possibly as early as December. As digital rights campaigner and former MEP Patrick Breyer </span><a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/chat-control-2-0-through-the-back-door-breyer-warns-the-eu-is-playing-us-for-fools-now-theyre-scanning-our-texts-and-banning-teens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>put it</span></a><span>, this manoeuvre amounts to “a deceptive sleight of hand” aimed at bypassing meaningful democratic debate and oversight.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While the removal of mandatory on-device detection is an improvement on the first draft, the new text still contains two extremely problematic features. First, it encourages “voluntary” mass scanning by online platforms — a practice already allowed in “temporary” form, which would now become a lasting feature of EU law. Second, it effectively outlaws anonymous communication by introducing mandatory age-verification systems.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>An </span><a href="https://csa-scientist-open-letter.org/Nov2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>open letter</span></a><span> signed by 18 of Europe’s leading cybersecurity and privacy academics warned that the latest proposal poses “high risks to society without clear benefits for children”. The first, in their view, is the expansion of “voluntary” scanning, including automated text analysis using AI to identify ambiguous “grooming” behaviours. This approach, they argue, is deeply flawed. Current AI systems are incapable of properly distinguishing between innocent conversation and abusive behaviour. As the experts explain, AI-driven grooming detection risks sweeping vast numbers of normal, private conversations into a dragnet, overwhelming investigators with false positives and exposing intimate communications to third parties.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Breyer further emphasised this danger by noting that no AI can reliably distinguish between innocent flirtation, humorous sarcasm — and criminal grooming. He warned that this amounts to a form of digital witch-hunt, whereby the mere appearance of words like “love” or “meet” in a conversation between family members, partners or friends could trigger intrusive scrutiny. This is not child protection, Breyer has argued, but mass suspicion directed at the entire population. Even under the existing voluntary regime, German federal police warn that roughly half of all reports received are criminally irrelevant, representing tens of thousands of leaked legal chats annually. According the Swiss Federal Police, meanwhile,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.republik.ch/2022/12/08/die-dunklen-schatten-der-chatkontrolle"><span>80%</span></a><span> of machine-reported content is not illegal. It might, for example, encompass harmless holiday photos showing nude children playing at a beach. The new text would expand these risks dramatically.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Further concerns arise from Article 4 of the new compromise proposal, which requires providers to implement “all appropriate risk mitigation measures”. This clause could allow authorities to pressure encrypted messaging services to enable scanning, even if this undermines their core security model. In practice, this could mean requiring providers such as WhatsApp, Signal or Telegram to scan messages on users’ devices before encryption is applied.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Electronic Frontier Foundation has </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/09/chat-control-back-menu-eu-it-still-must-be-stopped-0?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>noted</span></a><span> that this approach risks creating a permanent security infrastructure, one which could gradually become universal. Meta, Google and Microsoft already scan unencrypted content voluntarily; extending this practice to encrypted content would merely require technical changes. Moreover, what begins as a voluntary option can easily become compulsory in practice, as platforms face reputational, legal and market pressure to “cooperate” with the authorities. Furthermore, this doesn’t affect just people in the EU, but everyone around the world, including the United States. If platforms decide to stay in the EU, they would be forced to scan the conversations of everyone in the bloc. If you’re not in the EU, but you chat with someone who is, then your privacy is compromised too.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Another major danger is the introduction of mandatory age-verification systems for app stores and private messaging services. Though the Council claims these systems can be designed to “preserve privacy”, critics </span><a href="https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Segregate-and-Suppress.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>insist</span></a><span> that the very concept is technologically unworkable. Age assessments inevitably rely on biometric and behavioural data, both of which require invasive data collection. Far from protecting children, these systems would increase the volume of sensitive personal information being stored and potentially exploited.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Requiring official identity documents for online verification would exclude millions of people who lack easy access to digital IDs or who won’t provide such sensitive documentation merely to use a messaging service. In practice, this would spell the end of anonymous communication online, forcing users to present ID or face scans simply to open an email or messaging account. Breyer has warned that such measures would be particularly disastrous for whistleblowers, journalists, political activists and others reliant on online anonymity. It would also push under-16s towards less safe, poorly regulated alternatives that lack encryption or basic safety protections.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Ultimately, critics </span><a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/posts/messaging-and-chat-control/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>argue</span></a><span> that mass surveillance is simply the wrong approach to combating child sexual exploitation. Scanning private messages does not stop the circulation of child abuse material. Platforms such as Facebook have used scanning technologies for years, yet the number of automated reports continues to rise. Moreover, mandatory scanning would still fail to detect perpetrators who distribute material through decentralised secret forums or via encrypted archives shared using only links and passwords — methods that scanning algorithms cannot successfully penetrate. The most effective strategy would be to delete known abuse material from online hosts, something Europol has repeatedly failed to do.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Chat Control, in short, would do little to actually help victims of child sexual exploitation while harming everyone else. Every message would become subject to surveillance, without any judicial oversight, contrary to long-standing guarantees of private correspondence. There’s a legal question here too. The EU Court of Justice has previously ruled that general and automatic analysis of private communications violates fundamental rights, yet the EU is now poised to adopt legislation that contravenes this precedent. Once adopted, it could take years for a new judicial challenge to overturn it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The confidentiality of electronic communication — essential for personal privacy, business secrecy and democratic participation — would be sacrificed. Sensitive conversations could be read, analysed, wrongly flagged or even misused, as past scandals involving intelligence officials and tech employees have shown. One of the most notorious cases of intelligence abuse came from the US National Security Agency, in which multiple NSA employees were </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/uk/nsa-staff-used-spy-tools-on-spouses-ex-lovers-watchdog-idUSBRE98Q14H/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>caught</span></a><span> using the agency’s powerful surveillance tools to spy on romantic partners and ex-lovers. Leaked documents have also </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-26367781" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>shown</span></a><span>&nbsp;that the UK intelligence agency GCHQ captured and stored images from Yahoo webcam chats, including millions of sexually explicit images of completely innocent users. There have also been several cases of Big Tech employees — from </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/09/google-spy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Google</span></a><span> to </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/facebook-employees-look-at-user-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Facebook</span></a><span> — using internal tools to spy on unsuspecting users.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Furthermore, secure encryption, a foundation of cybersecurity, would be compromised by introducing backdoors or client-side scanning tools that foreign intelligence services or criminal actors could exploit. At the same time, the responsibility for criminal investigations would shift from democratically accountable authorities to opaque corporate algorithms, with minimal transparency or oversight.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://stopchatcontrol.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Opponents</span></a><span> therefore argue that the EU should instead adopt a fundamentally different approach: one that protects children without undermining fundamental rights. They propose ending the current voluntary scanning of private messages by US internet companies — restoring the principle that targeted surveillance requires a judicial warrant and must be limited to individuals reasonably suspected of wrongdoing — and maintain that secure end-to-end encryption, and the right to anonymous communication, must be preserved.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Particularly worrying is the issue of function creep, the process by which a technology introduced for a narrowly defined purpose gradually expands to serve broader, and sometimes entirely different, purposes over time. The UK’s Online Safety Act, passed in October 2023, obliges firms to develop child sexual abuse detection systems, even though the British government itself admits that such infrastructure is not yet technically available, creating legal authority awaiting technical capability. In the United States, “temporary” surveillance measures introduced under the post-9/11 Patriot Act became permanent, and indeed expanded in scope. Once a technological infrastructure for comprehensive online surveillance exists, it can easily be repurposed and is hard to dismantle. Technologies designed to detect harmful content can quickly be extended to political repression; examples from authoritarian states demonstrate how similar systems are used to identify and target dissidents.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Breyer </span><a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/chat-control-2-0-through-the-back-door-breyer-warns-the-eu-is-playing-us-for-fools-now-theyre-scanning-our-texts-and-banning-teens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>summarised</span></a><span> this pattern starkly: “They are selling us security but delivering a total surveillance machine. They promise child protection but punish our children and criminalise privacy.” The implications are ominous. Europe effectively stands on the threshold of building a machine that can see everything. Once constructed, it will serve not only the current political authorities — the idea of Ursula von der Leyen spying on everyone’s messages is disturbing enough — but whoever wields power next. With yet another vote approaching, the window to stop Chat Control is narrowing.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>More than a decade ago, when I was applying to graduate school, I went through a period of deep uncertainty. I had tried the previous year and hadn’t gotten in anywhere. I wanted to try again, but I had a lot going against me.</p>



<p>I’d spent most of my undergrad building a student job-portal startup and hadn’t balanced it well with academics. My GPA needed explaining. My GMAT score was just okay. I didn’t come from a big-brand employer. And there was no shortage of people with similar or stronger profiles applying to the same schools.</p>



<p>Even though I had learned a few things from the first round, the second attempt was still difficult. There were multiple points after I submitted applications where I lost hope.</p>



<p>But during that stretch, a friend and colleague kept repeating one line to me:</p>



<p><em>“All it takes is for one to work out.”</em></p>



<p>He’d say it every time I spiraled. And as much as it made me smile, a big part of me didn’t fully believe it. Still, it became a little maxim between us. And eventually, he was right – that one did work out. And it changed my life.</p>



<p>I’ve thought about that framing so many times since then.</p>



<p>It’s unbelievably powerful in any high-stakes search:</p>



<p>You don’t need every job to choose you. You just need the one that’s the right fit. </p>



<p>You don’t need every house to accept your offer. You just need the one that feels like home. </p>



<p>You don’t need every person to want to build a life with you. You just need the one.</p>



<p>You don’t need ten universities to say yes. You just need the one that opens the right door.</p>



<p>These processes – college admissions, job searches, home buying, finding a partner – can be emotionally brutal. They can get you down in ways that feel personal. But in those moments, that truth can be grounding.</p>



<p>All it takes is for one to work out.</p>



<p>And that one is all you need.</p>

        <h3>
            a.k.a. <span>Differentiation under the Integral Sign</span> &amp; <span>Leibniz Integral Rule</span>
        </h3>
    </p>

        <hr>

        <p>
            Among a few other integral tricks and techniques, Feynman's trick was a strong reason that made me love evaluating integrals, and although the technique itself goes back to Leibniz being commonly known as the Leibniz integral rule, it was Richard Feynman who popularized it, which is why it is also referred to as Feynman's trick.
            Here's an excerpt from his book, Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman:
        </p>

        <p>
            "One thing I never did learn was contour integration. I had learned to do integrals 
            by various methods shown in a book that my high school physics teacher Mr. Bader had given me.
        </p>

        <p>
            One day he told me to stay after class. "Feynman," he said, "you talk too much and you make too much noise.
            I know why. You're bored. So I'm going to give you a book. You go up there in the back, in the corner, and
            study this book, and when you know everything that's in this book, you can talk again."
        </p>

        <p>
            So every physics class, I paid no attention to what was going on with Pascal's Law, or whatever they were
            doing. I was up in the back with this book: Advanced Calculus, by Woods. Bader knew I had studied Calculus
            for the Practical Man a little bit, so he gave me the real works -- it was for a junior or senior course
            in college. It had Fourier series, Bessel functions, determinants, elliptic functions -- all kinds of
            wonderful stuff that I didn't know anything about.
        </p>

        <p>
            That book also showed how to differentiate parameters under the integral sign -- it's a certain operation.
            It turns out that's not taught very much in the universities; they don't emphasize it. But I caught on
            how to use that method, and I used that one damn tool again and again. So because I was self-taught using
            that book, I had peculiar methods of doing integrals.
        </p>

        <p>
            The result was, when guys at MIT or Princeton had trouble doing a certain integral, it was because they
            couldn't do it with the standard methods they had learned in school. If it was contour integration, they
            would have found it; if it was a simple series expansion, they would have found it. Then I come along and
            try differentiating under the integral sign, and often it worked. So I got a great reputation for doing
            integrals, only because my box of tools was different from everybody else's, and they had tried all their
            tools on it before giving the problem to me."         
        </p>

        <p>
            For me, employing this trick felt like I was using cheat codes to deal with integrals. At the same time, it enabled a lot of creativity and wishful thinking, which transformed integrals into puzzles. Unfortunately, this also means that there is no clear path on how and when to use this technique. In addition, what Feynman wrote still applies today since the method isn't taught much, if at all, in universities. Therefore, the trick can seem obscure and difficult to grasp for newcomers.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the following section, we will embark on a journey to develop some rules of thumb to have at our disposal when using Feynman's trick. These are merely some heuristics that I tend to use, so deviating from them can be perfectly acceptable. However, I hope that they can provide a path to follow when nothing obvious or intuitive occurs when someone tries to use this trick, or even better, so that they can serve as motivation for someone to start using the method.
        </p>

        <hr>
        <section id="chapter1"> <h2>Hello, World!</h2> </section>
        <hr>

        <p>
            Feynman already provided a significant hint about the trick when he mentioned differentiating under the integral sign, which is also an alternative name for the technique. More explicitly, if \(f(x,t)\) and \(\frac{\partial f(x,t)}{\partial t}\) is continuous with respect to both variables over the \([a,b]\) interval, then the following holds:
        </p>
        <p>
            \[\frac{d}{dt} \int_a^b f(x, t)dx = \int_a^b \frac{\partial f(x, t)}{\partial t}dx\]
        </p>

        <p>
            This is nice, but not so useful by itself since it doesn't say anything about how and when to apply it. Moreover, learning is not a spectator sport and one has to get their hands dirty as there are no shortcuts to it.
            Take for example chess, most people could read and understand the rules in a few minutes, however, if they would go on to play a game then most likely they would get stomped by a more experienced player. This is because the other player, through practice, learned some strategies to use when playing.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thus, with the goal to develop some strategies here as well, we will dive straight into action and approach Feynman's trick using practical examples. As a "Hello, World!" introduction, let's take a look at the following integral:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I=\int_0^1 \frac{x-1}{\ln x}dx\]
        </p>

        <p>
            You are encouraged to try and evaluate the integral using basic methods, but the logarithm being in the
            denominator makes this integral quite stubborn to deal with. Feynman's trick aims to get rid of this issue by differentiating under the intgeral sign, with respect to a parameter, in order to obtain an
            integral that is easier to evaluate.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unfortunately in the integral from above we lack a parameter, therefore the first step is to parameterise the integral, which can even mean introducing a whole function, but for this example we will simply consider:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I(t)=\int_0^1 \frac{x^t-1}{\ln x}dx\]
        </p>

        <p>
            Keep in mind that our original integral is just \(I(1)\). Also, surely we could've placed a parameter in many
            different places, such as:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I(a)=\int_0^1 \frac{x-a}{\ln x}dx, \quad I(b)=\int_0^1 \frac{x-1}{b-\ln x}dx, \quad I(c)=\int_0^1 \frac{x-1}{\ln (cx)}dx\ ...\]
        </p>

        <p>
            However, the main idea behind the trick is to obtain an integral that we can evaluate easier, after differentiating with respect to the new parameter. Let's put this in action and see what happens to \(I(t)\).
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I'(t)=\int_0^1 \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{x^t-1}{\ln x}\right)dx  = \int_0^1x^tdx = \frac{x^{t+1}}{t+1}\bigg|_0^1 = \frac{1}{t+1}\]
        </p>

        <p>
            Notice how easy it was to evaluate the integral \(I'(t)=\int_0^1x^tdx\) from above, had we kept \(I(a)\), \(I(b)\)
            or \(I(c)\) the things wouldn't had simplified at all after differentiating, and most significantly is that we would still
            have the \(\ln x\) in the denominator, a thing which made the integral hard to deal with in the first place.
        </p>

        <p>
            We can already sense that the following might be an important question in the future:
            <span>How to parameterise the integral when using Feynman's Trick?</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            We will worry about that a bit later, for now let's finish the integral as we only found \(I'(t)\).
            Since we are looking to find \(I(1)\) we need to integrate \(I'(t)\) back and set \(t=1\) in order to arrive there.
            Here it's useful to recall that:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[\int_a^b f'(x) dx = f(b)-f(a)\]
        </p>

        <p>
            For us, \(f(x)\) is just \(I(t)\) in the above expression. Luckily \(I(0)=0\), and as we are looking for
            \(I=I(1)\) we have:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I= I(1)-I(0)=\int_0^1 I'(t)dt = \int_0^1 \frac{1}{1+t}dt=\ln(1+t)\bigg|_0^1 = \ln 2\]
        </p>
        
        <p>
            So that is the big picture of Feynman's trick - we have an integral that is hard to evaluate
            in it's original form, therefore by differentiating under the integral sign
            we attempt to transform the integral so that it can be easier integrated, and in the end we go back to
            undo the differentiation step.
        </p>

        <hr>
        <section id="chapter2"> <h2>The parameter</h2> </section>
        <hr>

        <p>
            As emphasized above, the main goal of the technique is to obtain an integral that is easier to evaluate after
            differentiating with respect to a parameter, and one issue is that it is not always obvious how to parameterise the integral.
            In order to make things more intuitively we will play around with the integral from below.
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I=\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1+x)}{1+x^2}dx\]
        </p>

        <p>
            The most annoying thing is the logarithm, so if we get rid of it everything should be straightforward.
            There are a few parameter possibilities which makes sense to consider, namely:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I(a)=\int_0^1\frac{\ln(a+x)}{1+x^2}dx, \quad I(b) = \int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1+bx)}{1+x^2}dx\]
        </p>

        <p>
            With the first one we are out of luck, as differentiating with respect to \(a\) gives:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I'(a)=\int_0^1 \frac{1}{(a+x)(1+x^2)}dx = \frac{1}{1+a^2}\int_0^1\left(\frac{1}{a+x}+\frac{a}{1+x^2}-\frac{x}{1+x^2}\right)dx\]
            \[=\frac{\ln(1+a)}{1+a^2}-\frac{\ln a}{1+a^2} +\frac{\pi}{4}\frac{a}{1+a^2}-\frac{\ln 2}{2}\frac{1}{1+a^2}\]
        </p>

        <p>
            Therefore, if we would try to go back to what we're looking, which is \(I=I(1)-I(0)\), we would end up with
            \(I=I+\text{other stuff}\). This cancels out \(I\) and we wouldn't be able to recover it.
            Unfortunately, there's no magic formula that tells a priori whether placing a parameter in a specific place would
            succeed or fail in evaluating an integral - and sometimes we are simply unlucky.
        </p>

        <p>
            In contrast, things work out nicely with the second choice from above.
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I'(b)=\int_0^1\frac{x}{(1+bx)(1+x^2)}dx=\frac{1}{1+b^2}\int_0^1\left(\frac{b}{1+x^2}+\frac{x}{1+x^2}-\frac{b}{1+bx}\right)dx\]
            \[=\frac{\pi}{4}\frac{b}{1+b^2}+\frac{\ln 2}{2}\frac{1}{1+b^2}-\frac{\ln(1+b)}{1+b^2}\]
        </p>

        <p>
            Again, we are looking to find \(I(1)\), and as \(I(0) = 0\), we have:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I=\int_0^1 I'(b)db \Rightarrow 2I=\int_0^1 \left(\frac{\pi}{4}\frac{b}{1+b^2}+\frac{\ln 2}{2}\frac{1}{1+b^2}\right)db \Rightarrow I=\frac{\pi}{8}\ln 2\]
        </p>

        <p>
            This works, but we can do even better. Looking at the <a href="#chapter1">Hello, World!</a> integral we can see that there we simplified the logarithm in the denominator while performing \(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}x^t\). This is also the first thing that I always attempt to look for when using this technique - namely, to simplify something from the integrand which is independent to the parameter when differentiating. Surely for the current integral we got rid of the logarithm, but the denominator remained intact.
        </p>

        <p>
            In short this will be our first rule of thumb: <span>if possible, place the parameter so that something from the integral, which is not related to the parameter, gets simplified</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            In order to achieve this with our integral we would need to get rid of \(1+x^2\), and by using \(\ln x=\frac12\ln(x^2)\) we can rewrite the integral as:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I=\int_0^1\frac{\ln(1+x)}{1+x^2}dx=\frac12\int_0^1\frac{\ln(1+2x+x^2)}{1+x^2}dx\]
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, in this form it's more natural to place the parameter so that it simplifies \(1+x^2\) when differentiating with respect to \(t\), namely we can consider:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I(t)=\frac12\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(2x+t(1+x^2))}{1+x^2}dx\Rightarrow I'(t)=\frac12\int_0^1 \frac{1}{2x+t(1+x^2)}dx=\frac14\frac{\ln\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{1-t^2}}{t}\right)}{\sqrt{1-t^2}}\]
        </p>

        <p>
            Like for \(I(b)\) we are looking to find \(I(1)\), however here \(I(0)\) is equal to \(\frac12\int_0^1\frac{\ln(2x)}{1+x^2}dx\) not \(0\).
        </p>

        <p>
            \[\Rightarrow I=I(1)-I(0)+I(0)=\frac14\int_0^1\frac{\ln\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{1-t^2}}{t}\right)}{\sqrt{1-t^2}}dt+\frac12\int_0^1\frac{\ln(2x)}{1+x^2}dx\]
            \[\int_0^1\frac{\ln\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{1-t^2}}{t}\right)}{\sqrt{1-t^2}}dt\overset{\frac{1+\sqrt{1-t^2}}{t}=x}=-2\int_0^1 \frac{\ln x}{1+x^2}dx\Rightarrow I = \frac12\int_0^1 \frac{\ln 2}{1+x^2}dx=\frac{\pi}{8}\ln 2\]
        </p>

            For this specific integral we only avoided performing partial fractions so there wasn't really a big improvement by simplifying the denominator. However I want to emphasize the importance of this because it will make things come way more natural when deciding where place the parameter. <span>Of course, in case there's not an appropiate or immediate way to achieve this, it's perfectly fine to place the parameter elsewhere too.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            As mentioned previously, practicing is the best approach to get along with new techniques, therefore below are more integrals to evaluate alongside some hidden steps in case those will be needed. However, I strongly recommend to try and deal with the integrals before looking at any hints, and only check them afterwards for correctness.
        </p>

        <p>
                \[\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} \frac{\ln(1-\sin x)}{\sin x}dx = ?\]
        </p>

        <p>
                Consider introducing the following parameter:
                \[I(t)=\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} \frac{\ln(1-t\sin x)}{\sin x}dx \Rightarrow I'(t)= -\frac{2\arctan\left(\sqrt{\frac{1+t}{1-t}}\right)}{\sqrt{1-t^2}}\]
                This should lead to:
                \[\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} \frac{\ln(1-\sin x)}{\sin x}dx = I(1) - I(0)=\int_0^1 I'(t) dt \overset{\sqrt{\frac{1-t}{1+t}}=x} = -\frac{3\pi^2}{8}\]
                But it would be even better if the integral would be parameterised as:
                \[I(t)=\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} \frac{\ln(1-\sin t\sin x)}{\sin x}dx\]
                That is because usually when having trigonometric functions, parameterising the integral with another trigonometric function, leads to a more smoother result.
            </p>

        <p>
            \[\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1-x+x^2)}{x-x^2}dx = ?\]
        </p>

        <p>
                Consider introducing the following parameter:
                \[I(t)=\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1-t(x-x^2))}{x-x^2}dx\Rightarrow I'(t) = \frac{4\arctan\left(\sqrt{\frac{t}{4-t}}\right)}{\sqrt{t(4-t)}}\]
                This should lead to:
                \[I(1)=\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1-x+x^2)}{x-x^2}dx = I(1) - I(0) = \int_0^1 I'(t)dt \overset{\sqrt{\frac{4-t}{t}}= x}= -\frac{\pi^2}{9}\]
            </p>

        <p>
            \[\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} \frac{\arctan(\sin x)}{\sin x}dx = ?\]
        </p>

        <p>
                Consider introducing the following parameter:
                \[I(t)=\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} \frac{\arctan(t\sin x)}{\sin x}dx\Rightarrow I'(t)=\frac{\pi}{2\sqrt{1+t^2}}\]
                This should lead to:
                \[I(1)=\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} \frac{\arctan(t\sin x)}{\sin x}dx = I(1)-I(0) = \int_0^1 I'(t)dt = \frac{\pi}{2}\ln(1+\sqrt 2)\]
                It will also work if the integral is parameterised as:
                \[I(t)=\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} \frac{\arctan(\tan t\sin x)}{\sin x}dx\]
                However, in this case the first variant is simple enough to integrate back.
            </p>

        <p>
                \[\int_0^\infty x^2e^{-\left(4x^2+\frac{9}{x^2}\right)}dx = ?\]
        </p>

        <p>
                Consider introducing the following parameter:
                \[I(t)=\int_0^\infty x^2e^{-\left(4x^2+\frac{t}{x^2}\right)}dx\Rightarrow I'(t)=-\frac{\sqrt \pi}{4} e^{-4\sqrt t}\]
                Where the above result follows by using Glasser's master theorem alongside the Gaussian integral.
                This should lead to:
                \[\int_0^\infty x^2e^{-\left(4x^2+\frac{9}{x^2}\right)}dx = I(9)- I(0) + I(0) = \int_0^9 I'(t) dt +\frac{\sqrt \pi}{32}=\frac{13}{32}\frac{\sqrt \pi}{e^{12}}\]
            </p>

        <p>
                \[\int_0^1 \frac{\ln x}{1-x^2}dx = ?\]
        </p>

        <p>
                Consider parameterising the integral as:
                \[I(t)=\frac12\int_0^1\frac{\ln(1-t(1-x^2))}{1-x^2}dx\Rightarrow I'(t)=\frac{\arctan\left(\sqrt{\frac{t}{1-t}}\right)}{2\sqrt{t(1-t)}}\]
                This should lead to:
                \[\int_0^1 \frac{\ln x}{1-x^2}dx = I(1)- I(0) = \int_0^1 I'(t)dt \overset{\sqrt{\frac{1-t}{t}} = x}= -\frac{\pi^2}{8}\]
            </p>

        <p>
                \[\int_0^\infty \frac{e^{-x^2}}{1+x^2}dx = ?\]
        </p>

        <p>
                Consider parameterising the integral as:
                \[I(t)=\int_0^\infty \frac{e^{-t(1+x^2)}}{1+x^2}dx\Rightarrow I'(t) = -\frac{\sqrt \pi}{2\sqrt t}e^{-t}\]
                This should lead to:
                \[\int_0^\infty \frac{e^{-x^2}}{1+x^2}dx = e\left(I(1)-I(\infty)\right) = -e\int_1^\infty I'(t)dt= \frac{\pi e}{2}\operatorname{erfc}(1)\]
                Where \(\operatorname{erfc}(x)\) is the complementary error function.
            </p>

        <p>
                \[\int_0^\infty \frac{\ln\left(\frac{1-x^2+x^4}{(1-x^2)^2}\right)}{(1+x^2)^2}dx = ?\]
        </p>

        <p>
                Since \(1-x^2+x^4=(1+x^2)^2-3x^2\), consider parameterising the integral as:
                \[I(t)=\int_0^\infty \frac{\ln\left(\frac{t(1+x^2)^2-3x^2}{(1-x^2)^2}\right)}{(1+x^2)^2}dx\Rightarrow I'(t)=\frac{\pi}{2\sqrt{t(4t-3)}}\]
                And in order to go back it should be observed that \(\frac34(1+x^2)^2-3x^2=\frac34(1-x^2)^2\).
                \[\int_0^\infty \frac{\ln\left(\frac{1-x^2+x^4}{(1-x^2)^2}\right)}{(1+x^2)^2}dx=I(1)- I\left(\frac34\right)+ I\left(\frac34\right)\]
                \[=\int_\frac34^1 I'(t)dt + \frac{\pi}{4}\ln\left(\frac{3}{4}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2}\ln\left(\frac32\right)\]

        <section id="chapter3"> <h2>Accelerated Feynman's trick</h2> </section>
        <hr>

        <p>
            The previous chapter emphasized to parameterise integrals so that something from the integral, which is not related to the parameter, gets simplified when differentiating (if possible). However there are times when even though we can introduce a parameter to accomplish that, it wouldn't be enough to finish the integral.
        </p>

        <p>
            In this chapter we will look at a different way to obtain this simplification. Let's start by looking at a modified version of an integral that was previously given as an exercise.
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{-x^2}}{1+x^4}dx\]
        </p>

        <p>
            With \(\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{-x^2}}{1+x^2}dx\) it was quite direct to parameterise the integral as \(\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{-t(1+x^2)}}{1+x^2}dx\) since it simplifies the denominator, however the similar way to do that for our integral, \(\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{-x^2-t(1+x^4)}}{1+x^4}dx\), doesn't seem to work as it complicates things a bit too much.
        </p>

        <p>
            There is however a way to simplify the denominator and in the same time to obtain a decent integral afterwards. Without getting into too much details I will parameterise the integral as:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I(t)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{-x^2}}{1+x^4} e^{-tx^2}(x^2\sin t+\cos t) dx\]
        </p>

        <p>
            This will seem obscure, but fear not as we will never use this approach again.
            The whole point is to simplify \(1+x^4\), and the above function was created explicitly to achieve that, as \(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}e^{-tx^2}(x^2\sin t+\cos t)\) is \(-(1+x^4)e^{-tx^2}\sin t\). Note that even though we introduced a couple other terms, those aren't disturbing.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            \[I'(t)=-\sin t\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2}e^{-tx^2}dx \overset{(1+t)x^2\to x^2}= -\frac{\sin t}{\sqrt{1+t}} \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2}dx=-\sqrt \pi \frac{\sin t}{\sqrt{1+t}}\]
        </p>

        <p>
            Here we are looking to find \(I=I(0)\), and we also have \(I(\infty)=0\), therefore:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I=-\int_0^\infty I'(t)dt=\sqrt \pi \int_0^\infty \frac{\sin t}{\sqrt{1+t}}dt\overset{\sqrt{1+t}=x}=2\sqrt \pi \int_1^\infty \sin(x^2-1)dx\]
            \[=2\sqrt{\pi} \cos 1 \int_1^\infty\sin(x^2)dx-2\sqrt{\pi} \sin  1 \int_1^\infty\cos(x^2)dx\]
            \[=\pi\cos 1\frac{1-2S\left(\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}\right)}{\sqrt 2}-\pi\sin 1\frac{1-2C\left(\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}\right)}{\sqrt 2}\]
        </p>

        <p>
            Where \(S(x)\) and \(C(x)\) are the Fresnel integrals. However, the approach is important here, not the result itself.
        </p>

        <p>
            We can avoid the parametrisation from above by directly using \(\frac{1}{1+x^4}=\int_0^\infty e^{-tx^2}\sin t \, dt\), and then switch to double integrals, or put in other words: employ the accelerated Feynman's trick (in which we skip the usual parameterisation step).
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{-x^2}}{1+x^4}dx = \int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2}\int_0^\infty e^{-tx^2}\sin t \, dtdx\]
            \[=\int_{0}^\infty \sin t\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2}e^{-tx^2}dxdt\overset{(1+t)x^2\to x^2}=\sqrt{\pi}\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin t}{\sqrt{1+t}}dt\]
        </p>

        <p>
            The rest goes exactly as with the previous method, as all we did here was to skip differentiation step and instead we switched to double integrals.
        </p>

        <p>
            A natural question that arises here is how did \(\frac{1}{1+x^4}=\int_0^\infty e^{-tx^2}\sin t\, dt\) appear? Or even better, how can someone come up with similar results for other integrals? In the case from above, simply the Laplace transform of the sine function was used, however in general it's useful to have a list of such identities. There are tables of integral results that can be used - for example: Table of Integrals, Series, and Products by Gradshteyn and Ryzhik - but alternatively one can build up their own list of results which tend to appear often while evaluating other integrals.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <p>
            Let's conclude this chapter by evaluating one of the most popular integrals that appears when Feynman's trick gets into the conversation.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            \[I=\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin x}{x}dx\]
        </p>

        <p>
            Since \(\int_0^\infty e^{-xt} dt = \frac{1}{x}\), we can make use of this to rewrite the integral as:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I=\int_0^\infty \int_0^\infty \sin x e^{-xt}dtdx = \int_0^\infty \int_0^\infty \sin x e^{-xt}dxdt=\int_0^\infty \frac{1}{1+t^2}dt =\frac{\pi}{2}\]
        </p>

        <p>
            Alternatively, we can also consider the parameter version of this integral, \(\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin x}{x}e^{-xt}dx\), however I feel like switching to double integrals is way more intuitively.
        </p>

        <p>
            It might be worth to highlight again that this method should be used preferable when parameterising the integral leads to nowhere. For the above integral, the natural introduction of \(\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin(tx)}{x}dx\) unfortunatelly does fail, as we obtain a divergent integral after differentiating under the integral sign.
        </p>

        <p>
            Like in the previous chapter below are more integrals alongside some hints in order to practice with the accelerated variation of Feynman's trick. However in this case I do recommend to peek at hints faster in case nothing obvious comes to mind, and afterwards to attempt and understand why the mentioned identity can be used.
        </p>

        <p>
                \[\int_0^\infty \sin(x^2)dx=?\]
        </p>

        <p>
                Start by substituting \(x^2\to x\) and then switch to double integrals using:
                \[\int_0^\infty e^{-xt^2}dt = \frac{\sqrt \pi}{2\sqrt x}\]
                Where the latter result is due to the Gaussian integral. Also, this integral is one particular case of the Fresnel integral. 
            </p>

        <p>
            \[\int_0^\infty \frac{\operatorname{Li}_2(x)}{x\sqrt{1-x^2}}dx=?\]
        </p>

        <p>
                Switch directly to double integrals by using:
                \[\int_0^1 \frac{\ln t}{t-\frac{1}{x}}dt = \operatorname{Li}_2(x)\]
            </p>

        <p>
            \[\int_0^1 \frac{\arctan x\ln(1+x^2)}{x(1+x)}dx = ?\]
        </p>

        <p>
                Switch to double integrals by using the following result:
                \[\int_0^x \frac{\arctan t}{1+xt}dt = \frac{\arctan x \ln(1+x^2)}{2x}\]
            </p>

        <p>
            \[\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{x}{\pi^2+x^2}\frac{e^{2x}}{(1+e^{x})^3}dx\]
        </p>

        <p>
                Consider switching to double integrals with:
                \[\frac{x}{\pi^2+x^2}=\Im\left(-\frac{1}{\pi+ix}\right)=-\Im\int_0^\infty e^{-(\pi+ix)t}dt\]
                It's also really useful to try and see what happens when the Laplace transform of the cosine function is used instead, or the equivalent:
                \[\frac{x}{\pi^2+x^2}=\Re\left(\frac{1}{i\pi+x}\right)=\Re\int_0^\infty e^{-(i\pi+x)t}dt\]
            </p>

        <p>
            \[\int_0^\infty x\left(\operatorname{Ci}^2(x)+\operatorname{si}^2(x)\right)\operatorname{Ci}(x)dx\]
        </p>

        <p>
                Consider switching to double integrals using:
                \[\operatorname{Ci}^2(x)+\operatorname{si}^2(x)=\int_0^\infty \frac{e^{-xy}\ln(1+y^2)}{y}dy\]
            </p>


        <p>
            Above \(\operatorname{Li}_2(x)\) denotes the dilogarithm function and \(\operatorname{Ci}(x)\), \(\operatorname{si}(x)\) are the cosine and the sine integral functions, defined as:
        </p>


        <p>
            \[\operatorname{Li}_2(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n^2},\ \operatorname{Ci}(x) = - \int_x^\infty \frac{\cos t}{t}dt,\ \operatorname{si}(x) = - \int_x^\infty \frac{\sin t}{t}dt\]

        <hr>

        <p>
            We already got familiar with a popular version of Feynman's trick in the previous chapter. Similarly, now we will take a look at other interesting variants of Feynman's trick, which although might appear less often, they can still help to expand the applicability of the technique.

        <h3>
            Differentiating under the integral sign
        </h3>

        <p>
            We will start by taking a look at a much simpler case of Feynman's trick, namely, in the situation when it would be enough to simply differentiate under the integral sign without performing that "undo" step to integrate back.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a small note, it's true that "differentiating under the integral sign" tends to be used as an alternative name for Feynman's trick, however I prefer to keep this for the variant where only the differentiating process takes part, or as mentioned above, when there's no need to integrate back the result, and the name describes quite literally what we are doing.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's make this more clear by looking at the following integral:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I=\int_0^1 x^3 \ln^2 x \, dx \]
        </p>

        <p>
            We are already aware from the <a href="#chapter1">Hello, World!</a> integral how \(\ln x\) can be simplified, since \(\frac{\partial}{\partial a}x^a = x^a \ln x\). However, by introducing the parameter in that original form as \(x^a \ln^2 x\), we would just produce a third logarithm, so that's going in the opposite direction.
        </p>

        <p>
            Fortunatelly, if we take a step back, we can observe that after we find the result of \(\int_0^1 x^a dx\), then differentiating it w.r.t.\(a\) would give us as many logarithms as we want. So, let's put that integral to use.
        </p>

        <p>
            \[\mathcal J(a)=\int_0^1 x^a dx  = \frac{1}{a+1}\]
            \[\Rightarrow \mathcal J'(a) = \int_0^1 x^a \ln x \, dx = \left(\frac{1}{a+1}\right)' = - \frac{1}{(a+1)^2}\]
            \[\Rightarrow \mathcal J''(a) = \int_0^1 x^a \ln^2 x \, dx = \left(- \frac{1}{(a+1)^2}\right)' = \frac{2}{(a+1)^3}\]
            \[\Rightarrow I= \mathcal J''(3) = \int_0^1 x^3 \ln^2 x \, dx = \frac{1}{32}\]
        </p>

        <p>
            Of course the integral itself was quite simple this time, however the important part that should be highlighted is that not always we need to perform that "undo" step after differentiating under the integral sign - and sometimes knowing a general integral result can provide us more useful integrals by differentiating it.

        <h3>
            Feynman's trick &amp; indefinite integrals
        </h3>

        <p>
            Further, we will take a look at how Feynman's trick can be applied to indefinite integrals. Let's consider:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^3}} \exp\left({-\frac{(a-bx)^2}{2x}}\right) dx\]
        </p>

        <p>
            In this form it makes no sense to differentiate the integral with respect to any parameter, but we can extend the integral with temporary bounds by writing:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[\int f(x)dx = F(x) + C = F(x) - F(0) = \int_0^x f(t)dt\]
            \[\Rightarrow I(a,b,t)=\int_0^t\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^3}} \exp\left({-\frac{(a-bx)^2}{2x}}\right) dx\]
        </p>

        <p>
            After this we can go on apply Feynman's trick, however, first we are going get rid of the square root via the substitution \(\frac{1}{\sqrt x}\to x\).
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I(a,b,t)=2\int_\frac{1}{\sqrt t}^\infty \exp\left(-\frac12 \left(ax-b/x\right)^2\right)dx\]
        </p>

        <p>
            Here, we can notice that the derivative of \(ax-\frac{b}{x}\) is \(a+\frac{b}{x^2}\) so it would be quite helpful if we had that additional term.
            In the same time if we differentiate the integrand with respect to \(b\) we'll produce \(a-\frac{b}{x^2}\), which is really useful as \((ax-b/x)^2\) is equal to \((ax+b/x)^2+4ab\) and the derivative of \(ax+\frac{b}{x}\) is \(a-\frac{b}{x^2}\). So let's differentiate as mentioned above:
        </p>
           
        <p>
            \[\frac{\partial}{\partial b}I(a,b,t)=2\int_\frac{1}{\sqrt t}^\infty \exp\left(-\frac12 \left(ax-b/x\right)^2\right)\left(a-\frac{b}{x^2}\right)dx\]
            \[=2e^{2ab}\int_\frac{1}{\sqrt t}^\infty \exp\left(-\frac12 (ax+b/x)^2\right)\left(a-\frac{b}{x^2}\right)dx\]
            \[\overset{ax+b/x\to x}=2e^{2ab}\int_{\frac{a}{\sqrt t}+b\sqrt t}^\infty \exp{\left(-\frac{x^2}{2}\right)}dx=\sqrt{2\pi}e^{2ab}\operatorname{erfc}\left(\frac{\frac{a}{\sqrt t}+b\sqrt t}{\sqrt 2}\right)\]
        </p>

        <p>
            Where \(\operatorname{erfc}(x)\) is the complementary error function. Now we'll go back to \(I(a,b,t)\), but we should be careful to replace the dummy variable \(b\), with something else as the \(b\) parameter does also appear in the bounds.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            \[\lim_{b\to -\infty}I(a,b,t)=0\Rightarrow I(a,b,t)=\sqrt{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^be^{2ax}\operatorname{erfc}\left(\frac{\frac{a}{\sqrt t}+x\sqrt t}{\sqrt 2}\right)dx\]
            \[\overset{IBP}=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{\sqrt 2a}e^{2ax}\operatorname{erfc}\left(\frac{\frac{a}{\sqrt t}+x\sqrt t}{\sqrt 2}\right)\bigg|_{-\infty}^b+\frac{\sqrt t}{a}\int_{-\infty}^b e^{2ax}\exp\left(-\frac{(a+xt)^2}{2t}\right)dx\]
            \[=\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{1}{a}e^{2ab}\operatorname{erfc}\left(\frac{\frac{a}{\sqrt t}+b\sqrt t}{\sqrt 2}\right)+\frac{\sqrt t}{a}\int_{-\infty}^b \exp\left(-\frac12\left(x\sqrt{t}-\frac{a}{\sqrt{t}}\right)^2\right)dx\]
            \[\overset{x\sqrt t-\frac{a}{\sqrt t}\to -x}=\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{1}{a}e^{2ab}\operatorname{erfc}\left(\frac{\frac{a}{\sqrt t}+b\sqrt t}{\sqrt 2}\right)+\frac{1}{a}\int^{\infty}_{\frac{a}{\sqrt t}-b\sqrt t}\exp\left(-\frac{x^2}{2}\right)dx\]
            \[=\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{1}{a}\left(e^{2ab}\operatorname{erfc}\left(\frac{\frac{a}{\sqrt t}+b\sqrt t}{\sqrt 2}\right)+\operatorname{erfc}\left(\frac{\frac{a}{\sqrt t}-b\sqrt t}{\sqrt 2}\right)\right)\]
        </p>

        <p>
            Or for the indefinite integral, this would lead to:
        </p>
        
        <p>
            \[\small \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^3}} \exp\left({-\frac{(a-bx)^2}{2x}}\right) dx=\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{1}{a}\left(e^{2ab}\operatorname{erfc}\left(\frac{\frac{a}{\sqrt x}+b\sqrt x}{\sqrt 2}\right)+\operatorname{erfc}\left(\frac{\frac{a}{\sqrt x}-b\sqrt x}{\sqrt 2}\right)\right)+C\]

            Feynman's trick &amp; power series
        </h3>

        <p>
            Next, we will take a look at how to combine Feynman's trick with power series. For this we are going to look at:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I=\int_{0}^{1}\int_{0}^{1}\frac{x\ln x\ln y}{1-xy}\frac{dxdy}{\ln(xy)}\]
        </p>

        <p>
            We are already got familiar with what to do when there is a logarithm in the denominator as we saw that we can get rid of them by using \(\frac{d}{dt} x^t = x^t\ln x\), however here also the \(1-xy\) term appears. In order to solve this issue we'll make use of the geoemtric series, namely \(\frac{1}{1-x}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n\), but we will expand into series a bit later and for now continue with the following integral:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I(n)=\int_{0}^{1}\int_{0}^{1}\frac{(xy)^{n-1}x\ln x\ln y}{\ln(xy)}dxdy\Rightarrow I'(n)=\int_0^1\int_0^1  (xy)^{n-1} x \ln x \ln y dxdy\]
            \[=\int_0^1 x^{n} \ln x \, dx \int_0^1 y^{n-1} \ln y\, dy=\frac{1}{(n+1)^2}\frac{1}{n^2}\]
        </p>

        <p>
            Now we have to to get back to \(I(n)\):
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I(n)=-(I(\infty)-I(n))=-\int_n^\infty \frac{1}{(x+1)^2 x^2 } dx=-\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+1}+2\ln\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)\]
        </p>

        <p>
            And finally, we'll put the geometric series to use.
        </p>

        <p>
            \[\int_0^1\int_0^1 \frac{ x\ln x\ln y}{(1-xy)\ln(xy)}dx\ dy=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \int_0^1\int_0^1 \frac{(xy)^{n-1} x\ln x\ln y}{\ln(xy)}dxdy\]
            \[\small =\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(-\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+1}+2\ln\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)\right)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\underbrace{\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+1}}_{1}-2\left(\underbrace{\frac{1}{n}-\ln\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)}_{\gamma}\right)\right)\]
        </p>

        <p>
            So the result is simply \(1-2\gamma\), where \(\gamma\) is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Feynman's trick &amp; differential equations
        </h3>

        <p>
            In what's to come we are going to take a look at a combination between Feynman's trick and differential equations. Let's consider the following integral:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I=\int_0^\infty \frac{\cos x}{1+x^2}dx\]
        </p>

        <p>
            We can start by parameterising the cosine function and then employ the accelerated Feynman's trick:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I(t)=\int_0^\infty \frac{\cos(tx)}{1+x^2}dx=\int_0^\infty \int_0^\infty \cos(tx)\sin y e^{-xy}dydx\]
            \[\small =\int_0^\infty \sin y \int_0^\infty \cos(tx)e^{-xy}dxdy=\int_0^\infty \frac{y\sin y}{t^2+y^2}dy\overset{y\to tx}=\int_0^\infty \frac{x\sin(tx)}{1+x^2}dx\]
        </p>

        <p>
            We haven't made much progress above, since we simply arrived at another integral with \(x\sin(tx)\) instead of \(\cos(tx)\), thus  complexity is the same. However, as \(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\cos(tx)\) is \(x\sin(tx)\), differentiating \(I(t)\) gives us a differential equation to work with, namely:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I'(t)=- \int_0^\infty \frac{x\sin(tx)}{1+x^2}dx = - I(t) \Rightarrow \frac{I'(t)}{I(t)}=-1\Rightarrow I(t) = C e^{-t}\]
            \[I(0)=\int_0^\infty \frac{1}{1+x^2}dx=\frac{\pi}{2} \Rightarrow I(t)=\frac{\pi}{2}e^{-t}\]
            \[ I = I(1) \Rightarrow I = \frac{\pi}{2e}\]
        </p>

        <p>
            As a small note for the starting step, although employing the accelerated Feynman's trick was rather obvious as to get rid of the denominator, the additional introduction of the \(t\) parameter might be weird first. However performing the same steps without this parameter gives us:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[\int_0^\infty \frac{\cos x}{1+x^2}dx=\int_0^\infty \frac{x\sin x}{1+x^2}dx\]
        </p>

        <p>
            Which indicates that one might put to use the fact that \(I(1)=-I'(1)\), by adding the additional \(t\) parameter.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Generalizing Feynman's trick
        </h3>

        <p>
            So far we've seen the Feynman's trick applied only when the parameter was inside the integrand, however it can also be used when the bounds are parameterised as well. More generally, the following holds:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[\frac{d}{dt} \int_{a(t)}^{b(t)} f(x, t)dx = \frac{d}{dt}b(t)f(x,b(t))-\frac{d}{dt}a(t)f(x,a(t))+\int_{a(t)}^{b(t)} \frac{\partial f(x, t)}{\partial t}dx\]
        </p>

        <p>
            We'll put this to use with the integral from below.
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I=\int_\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}^1 \frac{\operatorname{arccosh}\left(\sqrt 2 x\right)}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}dx\]
        </p>

        <p>
            Above we can see that the same \(\sqrt 2\) appears in both the lower bound and the \(\operatorname{arccosh}\) function, so we'll parameterise the integral as:
        </p>
        
        <p>
            \[I(t)=\int_\frac{1}{t}^1 \frac{\operatorname{arccosh}\left(t x\right)}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}dx
            \Rightarrow I'(t) = \frac{1}{t^2}\frac{\cancelto{0}{\operatorname{arccosh}\left(t\frac{1}{t}\right)}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{1}{t^2}}}+\int_\frac{1}{t}^1\frac{x}{\sqrt{1-t^2x^2}\sqrt{1-x^2}}dx\]
            \[\overset{1-x^2\to x^2}=\frac1t\int_0^{\sqrt{1-\frac{1}{t^2}}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{1}{t^2}-x^2}}dx=\frac1t\arcsin\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{1-\frac{1}{t^2}}}\right)\bigg|_0^\sqrt{1-\frac1{t^2}}=\frac{\pi}{2t}\]
        </p>

        <p>
            We're looking to find \(I=I\left(\sqrt 2\right)\), and since \(I\left(1\right)=0\), we have:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I=\int_1^\sqrt 2I'(t)dt = \frac{\pi}{2} \int_1^\sqrt 2 \frac{1}{t}dt=\frac{\pi}{4}\ln 2\]
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h3>
            Generating integrals using Feynman's trick
        </h3>

        <p>
            Now we'll take a look at a fancier way to use Feynman's trick, especially in order to generate new integrals, for this we're considering:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I(t)=\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} \arctan\left(\frac{\sin x-\tan\frac{t}{2}}{\cos x}\right)dx\]
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that we are not trying to evaluate the above integral, instead we are simply using it in order to build up new integrals with the result that follows after differentiating w.r.t. \(t\).
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I'(t)=-\frac12\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\frac{\cos x}{1-\sin t\sin x}dx=\frac12 \frac{\ln(1-\sin t)}{\sin t}\]
        </p>

        <p>
            We also have that \(I(\pi)=-\frac{\pi^2}{4}\) and \(I(0)=\frac{\pi^2}{8}\), therefore:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I(\pi)-I(0)=-\frac{\pi^2}{4}-\frac{\pi^2}{8}=\frac12\int_0^\pi \frac{\ln(1-\sin x)}{\sin x}dx\]
            \[\Rightarrow \int_0^\pi \frac{\ln(1-\sin x)}{\sin x}dx=-\frac{3\pi^2}{4}\]
        </p>

        <p>
            In retrospect, this integral also appeared as an exercise in the  <a href="#chapter2">second chapter</a>, and with the same suggestion from there, we can evaluate the integral by applying Feynman's trick to:
        </p>
        
        <p>
            \[I(t)=\int_0^\pi \frac{\ln(1-\sin t\sin x)}{\sin x}dx\]
        </p>

        <p>
            Admittedly, following this parameterisation is much more intuitevely than what we've shown with the new variation, however it's also useful to have this trick in the bag.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <p>
            To keep the practice going, underneath are listed some integrals that can be evaluated with one version of Feynman's trick described in this chapter.
        </p>

        <p>
            \[\int_1^\infty \int_1^\infty (x+y)^2 e^{-(x+y)}dxdy = ?\]
        </p>

        <p>
                Start by showing that:
                \[I(t)=\int_1^\infty \int_1^\infty e^{-t(x+y)}dxdy = \left(\frac{e^{-t}}{t}\right)^2\]
                Then differentiate both sides two times with respect to \(t\) and set \(t=1\).
            </p>

        <p>
            \[\int x^4\cos(nx)dx = ?\]
        </p>

        <p>
                Differentiate four times with respect to \(n\) the following extended indefinite integral:
                \[
                    I(n,t) = \int_0^t \cos(nx) dx
                \]
            </p>

        <p>
            \[\int_0^1 \int_0^1 \frac{dxdy}{(1+xy)\ln(xy)} = ?\]
        </p>

        <p>
                Combine the geometric series \(\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n x^n = \frac{1}{1+x}\) with:
                \[I(t)=\int_0^1 \int_0^1 \frac{(xy)^t}{\ln(xy)}dxdy\]
            </p>

        <p>
            \[\int_0^\infty \frac{\sin^2 x}{x^2(1+x^2)}dx = ?\]
        </p>

        <p>
                Solve the resulting differential equation after differentiating twice the following integral:
                \[
                    I(t) = \int_0^\infty \frac{\sin^2 (tx)}{x^2(1+x^2)}dx
                \]
            </p>

        <p>
            \[\int_0^1 \ln x \left(\frac{1}{t+x}+\frac{1}{\frac{1}{t}+x}\right)dx = ?\]
        </p>

        <div>
            <p>
                Split the integral in two parts, then substitute \(x\to tx\) and respectively \(x\to \frac{x}{t}\) in the resulting integrals to obtain:
                \[I(t)= \int_0^1 \ln x \left(\frac{1}{t+x}+\frac{1}{\frac{1}{t}+x}\right)dx = \int_0^\frac{1}{t} \frac{\ln(tx)}{1+x}dx + \int_0^t \frac{\ln\left(\frac{x}{t}\right)}{1+x}dx\]
                Now employ the Feynman's trick (in the generalized variant).
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p> 
                In disguise this exercise is a reformulation of the following identity:
                \[
                    \operatorname{Li}_2(-t)+\operatorname{Li}_2\left(-\frac{1}{t}\right) = -\frac{\pi^2}{6} - \frac{1}{2}\ln^2 t
                \]
                Where \(\operatorname{Li}_2(x)\) is the dilogarithm function.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            \[\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2}dx = ?\]
        </p>

        <p>
                This integral can be generated starting from:
                \[I(t)=\int_0^\infty \frac{e^{-t(1+x^2)}}{1+x^2}dx\Rightarrow I'(t)=-e^{-t}\int_0^\infty e^{-tx^2} dx\overset{\sqrt t x \to x}= -\frac{e^{-t}}{\sqrt t}\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx\]
                Afterwards it should be observed that \(I(0)=\frac{\pi}{2}\) and \(I(\infty)=0\), therefore:
                \[\frac{\pi}{2} = \int_0^\infty \frac{e^{-t}}{\sqrt t} dt \int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx \overset{t\to t^2} = 2\left(\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2}dx\right)^2 \]
            </p>

        <section id="chapter5"> <h2>Feynman's trick in practice</h2> </section>
        <hr>

        <p>
            In this last chapter we'll dive into some "real-world" integrals and observe how Feynman's trick can be adapted for them.
            Additionally, we will also attempt to build up some heuristics that'll help us manipulate the integrals up to a point where we can introduce an useful parameter. This is due to the fact that with most of the previous examples we had the luxury to parameterise the integrals as they appeared, however often this might not be the case.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Breaking the rules
        </h3>

        <p>
            In the <a href="#chapter2">second chapter</a> we've observed how parameterising the integral so that it also simplifies some parts of the integral can make things more intuitively. However, we can always look for better, especially when our approach doesn't seem elegant enough.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's see how can we break this rule with the following integral:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I=\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1-x^2+x^4)}{1-x^2} dx\]
        </p>

        <p>
            As with our first rule of thumb it's straightforward to introduce the new parameter as:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I(a)=\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(a(1-x^2)+x^4)}{1-x^2} dx \Rightarrow I'(a)= \int_0^1 \frac{1}{a(1-x^2)+x^4}dx\]
        </p>

        <p>
            You are encouraged to proceed forward with the above integral, however computing \(I'(a)\) might not give the most pleasant result. So to overcome this, we'll manipulate the integral a bit before parametersing it.
        </p>

        <p>
            One extremely useful substitution (which deserves its own special chapter) is \(x\to \frac{1-x}{1+x}\). This one is great here especially since it has the following property (among many others):
        </p>

        <p>
            \[\int_0^1 \frac{f(x)}{1-x^2}dx \overset{x\to\frac{1-x}{1+x}}= \frac12\int_0^1 \frac{f\left(\frac{1-x}{1+x}\right)}{x}dx\]
            \[\Rightarrow I \overset{x\to\frac{1-x}{1+x}}= \frac12\underbrace{\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1+14x^2+x^4)}{x}dx}_{x^2\to x} - \frac12 \int_0^1 \frac{\ln((1+x)^4)}{x}dx\]
            \[= \frac14\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1+14x+x^2)}{x}dx - 2 \int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1+x)}{x}dx = \frac14 I(\operatorname{arccosh} 7) -  I(0)\]
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Above, although we could have introduced a simple parameter, for a smoother result we parameterised the integral as:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I(t)=\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1+2\cosh t+x^2)}{x} dx \Rightarrow I'(t)= \int_0^1 \frac{2\sinh t}{1+2\cosh t+x^2}dx\]
            \[= \int_0^1 \frac{2\sinh t}{(x+\cosh t)^2-\sinh^2 t}dx = -2\operatorname{arctanh}\left(\frac{x+\cosh t}{\sinh t}\right)\bigg|_0^1 = t\]
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, to find to find \(I\) we can combine \(I(\operatorname{arccosh} 7)\) with \(I(0)\).
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I = \frac14 \int_0^{\operatorname{arccosh 7}} t \, dt - \frac34 I(0) = \frac{\ln^2(2+\sqrt 3)}{2} - \frac{\pi^2}{8}\]
        </p>

        <hr>

        <p>
            The result from above follows since includes \(I(0) = \frac{\pi^2}{6}\), which is also the Basel problem in disguise, but you're further encouraged to approach it by employing Feynman's trick.
        </p>

        <p>
            \[\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1+x)}{x}dx=\frac{\pi^2}{12}\]
        </p>

        <p>
                One idea is to rewrite the integral as:
                \[ I=\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1+x)}{x}dx\overset{x\to x^3}=3\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1+x^3)}{x}dx\]
                \[\Rightarrow \frac13I-I=\int_0^1 \frac{\ln\left(\frac{1+x^3}{1+x}\right)}{x}dx\Rightarrow I = -\frac32 \int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1-x+x^2)}{x}dx \]
                Now put Feynman's trick to use for:
                \[I(t)=\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1-tx+x^2)}{x}dx\]
                But also take into account that:
                \[I(0)=\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1+x^2)}{x}dx\overset{x^2\to x}=\frac12 \int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1+x)}{x}dx=\frac12I\]

        <h3>
            Switching to rational functions
        </h3>

        <p>
            Maybe it's just a personal preference, but for me working with rational functions tends to give a higher visibility on how to parameterise the integrals. We'll see what is meant by this when dealing with the following integral:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I=\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\ln(2+\tan^2 x)dx\]
        </p>

        <p>
            In this form, two immediate ways to parameterise the integral are as follows:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I(a)=\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\ln(a+\tan^2 x)dx,\quad I(b)=\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\ln(2+b\tan^2 x)dx\]
        </p>

        <p>
            It turns out that both variants work, but we can do better. Another rule of thumb that I follow is to use almost exclusive rational functions as they often provide the most visibility to work with. Let's do that for our integral too.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            \[I=\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\ln(2+\tan^2 x)dx\overset{\tan x\to x}=\int_0^\infty \frac{\ln(2+x^2)}{1+x^2}dx\]
        </p>

        <p>
            And at this point it should be obvious where to place the parameter so that we can simplify the denominator.
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I(t)=\int_0^\infty \frac{\ln(1+t(1+x^2))}{1+x^2}dx\Rightarrow I'(t)=\int_0^\infty \frac{1}{1+t+tx^2}dx=\frac{\pi}{2}\frac{1}{\sqrt t\sqrt{1+t}}\]
            \[\Rightarrow I=\int_0^1 I'(t)dt=\frac{\pi}{2}\int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt t\sqrt{1+t}}dt\overset{t=x^2}=\pi\int_0^1\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}dx=\pi\ln(1+\sqrt 2)\]
        </p>

        <p>
            Obviously, if you're already more used to trigonometric functions, hyperbolic functions or anything else, then this can be ignored. I however recommend switching to rational functions, a few exceptions being when there's a clear way to parameterise the integral directly or when at least one of the bounds is \(\infty\).
        </p>

        <hr>

        <p>
            For more practice you can also attempt to tackle the following integral:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2} \ln(\sec^2 x +\tan^4 x)dx=?\]
        </p>

        <p>
                Start by substituting \(\tan x \to x\) then employ Feynman's trick.
            </p>

        <h3>
            Cleaning up the functions
        </h3>

        <p>
            Before parameterising the integrals it's quite useful to clean the disturbing functions as much as possible before any parameterisation. Let's demonstrate this by considering:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I=\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\arctan\left(\frac{2\sin x}{2\cos x -1}\right)\frac{\sin\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)}{\sqrt{\cos x}}dx\]
        </p>

        <p>
            As we have trigonometric functions all over the place, we will perform the Weierstrass substitution \(\tan\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\to x\) in order to obtain only rational functions, as per the previous heuristic.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            \[\Rightarrow I = 2\int_0^1 \frac{x\arctan\left(\frac{4x}{1-3x^2}\right)}{\sqrt{1-x^2}(1+x^2)}dx\]
        </p>

        <p>
            It would be great to parameterise the integral so that we get rid of the arctangent function, but unfortunately here it is a bit overloaded, therefore we'll clean it by splitting it into two. In case it's not obvious how to do that directly, we can differentiate it, perform partial fractions and then integrate back.
        </p>

        <p>
            \[\frac{d}{dx}\arctan\left(\frac{4x}{1-3x^2}\right)=\frac{12x^2+4}{9x^4+10x^2+1}=\frac{1}{1+x^2}+\frac{3}{1+9x^2}\]
            \[\Rightarrow \int \left(\frac{1}{1+x^2}+\frac{3}{1+9x^2}\right) dx = \arctan x + \arctan(3x) + C\]
        </p>

        <p>
            However since we're integrating over the \((0,1)\) interval we have that \(x \cdot 3 x&gt;1\) for \(x &gt; \frac{1}{\sqrt 3}\), so we need to rewrite the integral as:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I=2\int_0^1 \frac{x(\arctan x + \arctan(3x))}{\sqrt{1-x^2}(1+x^2)}dx - 2 \int_\frac{1}{\sqrt 3}^1 \frac{x}{\sqrt{1-x^2}(1+x^2)}dx\]
            \[= 2 \mathcal J - \frac{\pi}{\sqrt 2}\ln(2+\sqrt 3)\]
        </p>

        <p>
            At this point there's only left to evaluate the first integral, \(\mathcal J\), for which we'll employ Feynman's trick. There isn't any way to place the parameter so that we get rid of anything from the denominator so we'll simply introduce the following parameterisation:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[\mathcal J(t)=\int_0^1 \frac{x(\arctan x + \arctan(tx))}{\sqrt{1-x^2}(1+x^2)}dx\Rightarrow \mathcal J'(t) = \int_0^1 \frac{x^2}{\sqrt{1-x^2}(1+x^2)(1+t^2 x^2)}dx\]
        </p>

        <p>
            In general when we have rational functions it is prefered to integrate over \((0,\infty)\), if possible, as it drastically reduces the result, and when there's the derivative of \(\arcsin x\) in the denominator one way to map \((0,1)\) to \((0,\infty)\) is to directly substitute \(x \to \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\).
        </p>
            
        <p>
            \[\Rightarrow \mathcal J=\int_0^\infty \frac{1}{(2+x^2)(1+t^2+x^2)}dx = \frac{\pi}{2(1-t^2)}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+t^2}}-\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\right)\]
        </p>

        <p>
            Now in order to go back to \(\mathcal J(3)\), we'll make use of \(\mathcal J(-1)=0\), so:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[\mathcal J = \frac{\pi}{2}\int_{-1}^3 \frac{1}{(1-t^2)}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+t^2}}-\frac{1}{\sqrt 2}\right)dt\]
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, to finish this integral we'll subsitute \(t = \frac{1-x}{1+x}\).
        </p>
    
        <p>
            \[\Rightarrow \mathcal J = \frac{\pi}{4\sqrt 2}\int_{-\frac12}^\infty \frac{1}{x}\left(\frac{1+x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}-1\right)dx=\frac{\pi}{\sqrt 2}\ln \left(\frac{1+\sqrt 5}{2}\right)\]
        </p>

        <p>
            As such, we can conclude that:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\arctan\left(\frac{2\sin x}{2\cos x -1}\right)\frac{\sin\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)}{\sqrt{\cos x}}dx=\sqrt 2 \pi \ln \left(\frac{1+\sqrt 5}{2}\right)- \frac{\pi}{\sqrt 2}\ln(2+\sqrt 3)\]
        </p>

        <hr>

        <p>
            Similarly you can try and tackle the following integral:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[\int_0^\pi \arctan\left(\frac{1+2\cos x}{\sqrt 3}\right)dx=?\]
        </p>

        <p>
                Start by substituting \(\tan\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) \to x\), then split the arctangent function into two parts and use Feynman's trick.
            </p>

        <hr>

        <h3>
            Preparing better integral bounds
        </h3>

        <p>
            Another useful thing to consider before using Feynman's trick is to manipulate the bounds prior to parameterising the integral so that they get rid of any complicated functions for the differentiated integral, \(I'(t)\). This will almost always give a smoother and easier integral that we have to undo. We will show this in action with the integral from below.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            \[I=\int_0^1 \frac{x^2 \ln(1-x^2)}{1+x^4}dx\]
        </p>

        <p>
            With the previous heuristic we've already seen that it is useful to integrate over \((0,\infty)\) when there are some rational functions - therefore we will attempt to do the same with this integral. You are encouraged to try and see what kind of mess it would be produced by parameterising the integral as it is, when the bounds are \((0,1)\). However we will jump straightforward to get our bounds to \((0,\infty)\).
        </p>

        <p>
            In order to obtain that we can notice that the integrand is even, so we can move the bounds to \((-1,1)\) and then substitute \(x\to \frac{1-x}{1+x}\) again, which is another useful way to get our bounds at \((0,\infty)\).
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I=\frac12\int_{-1}^1 \frac{x^2\ln(1-x^2)}{1+x^4}dx\overset{x\to\frac{1-x}{1+x}}=\frac12\int_0^\infty \frac{(1-x)^2\ln\left(\frac{4x}{(1+x)^2}\right)}{1+6x^2+x^4}dx\]
        </p>

        <p>
            Now we can split the logarithm into three parts and use that:
        </p>
        
        <p>
            \[\int_0^\infty \frac{(1-x)^2}{1+6x^2+x^4}dx = \frac{\pi}{2\sqrt 2}-\frac{\ln(1+\sqrt 2)}{\sqrt 2}\]
            \[\int_0^\infty \frac{(1-x)^2\ln(x)}{1+6x^2+x^4}dx\overset{x\to\frac{1}{x}} = -\int_0^\infty \frac{(1-x)^2\ln(x)}{1+6x^2+x^4}dx = 0\]
        </p>

        <p>
            Therefore our integral is:
        </p>
        
        <p>
            \[I=\frac{\pi\ln 2}{2\sqrt 2}-\frac{\ln 2\ln(1+\sqrt 2)}{\sqrt 2}-\mathcal J, \quad \mathcal J = \int_0^\infty \frac{(1-x)^2\ln(1+x)}{1+6x^2+x^4}dx\]
        </p>

        <p>
            To evaluate the emerging integral we will perform Feynman's trick. There's not an obvious way to place the parameter as to simplify the denominator, so we'll parameterise the integral as:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[\mathcal J(a) = \int_0^\infty \frac{(1-x)^2\ln(1+ax)}{1+6x^2+x^4}dx\Rightarrow \mathcal J'(a)\int_0^\infty \frac{x(1-x)^2}{(1+ax)(1+6x^2+x^4)}dx\]
            \[=-\frac{(1+a)^2\ln a}{1+6a^2+a^4}-\frac{\ln(1+\sqrt 2)}{\sqrt 2}\frac{a(3-a+a^2)+1}{1+6a^2+a^4}+\frac{\pi}{2\sqrt 2}\frac{a(3+a+a^2)-1}{1+6a^2+a^4}\]
        </p>

        <p>
            The partial fraction was ommited above, as what's really important here is that we're left only with a simple \(\ln a\) as a "disturbing" function. In contrast, if the bounds were \((0,1)\) things would have been way more complicated.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's finish this integral as we still have to undo the differentiating step.
        </p>

        <p>
            \[\mathcal J(1)=\mathcal J(1)-\mathcal J(0)=\int_0^1 \mathcal J'(a)da\]
            \[=-\int_0^1\frac{(1+a)^2\ln a}{1+6a^2+a^4}da-\frac{\pi\ln(1+\sqrt 2)}{8\sqrt 2}-\frac{3\ln 2\ln(1+\sqrt 2)}{4\sqrt 2}-\frac{\pi^2}{16\sqrt 2}+\frac{3\pi\ln 2}{8\sqrt 2}\]
            \[\int_0^1\frac{(1+x)^2\ln x}{1+6x^2+x^4}dx=\int_0^1\left(\frac{1}{2\sqrt 2}\frac{(1+\sqrt 2)-x}{(1+\sqrt 2)^2+x^2}-\frac{1}{2\sqrt 2}\frac{(1-\sqrt 2)-x}{(1-\sqrt 2)^2+x^2}\right)\ln x \, dx\]
            \[\small =\frac{1}{8\sqrt 2}\left(\operatorname{Li}_2\left(-(1+\sqrt 2)^2\right)-\operatorname{Li}_2\left(-(1-\sqrt 2)^2\right)\right)+\frac{1}{2\sqrt 2}\left(\operatorname{Ti}_2\left(-(1+\sqrt 2)\right)-\operatorname{Ti}_2\left(-(1-\sqrt 2)\right)\right)\]
        </p>

        <p>
            The result from above follows since:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[\int_0^1 \frac{x\ln x}{a^2+x^2}dx\overset{x^2\to x}=\frac14\int_0^1 \frac{\ln x}{a^2+x}dx=\frac14\operatorname{Li}_2\left(-\frac{1}{a^2}\right)\]
            \[\int_0^1 \frac{a\ln x}{a^2+x^2}dx\overset{x\to ax}=\int_0^\frac1a\frac{\ln a +\ln x}{1+x^2}dx\overset{IBP}=-\operatorname{Ti}_2\left(\frac1a\right)\]
        </p>

        <p>
            Where \(\operatorname{Li}_2(x)\) is the dilogarithm and \(\operatorname{Ti}_2(x)\) is the inverse tangent integral.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, collecting all the results yields:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I=\frac{\pi^2}{16\sqrt 2}+\frac{\pi \ln 2}{8\sqrt 2}+\frac{\pi\ln(1+\sqrt 2)}{8\sqrt 2}-\frac{\ln 2\ln(1+\sqrt 2)}{4\sqrt 2}\]
            \[\small +\frac{1}{8\sqrt 2}\left(\operatorname{Li}_2\left(-(1+\sqrt 2)^2\right)-\operatorname{Li}_2\left(-(1-\sqrt 2)^2\right)\right)+\frac{1}{2\sqrt 2}\left(\operatorname{Ti}_2\left(-(1+\sqrt 2)\right)-\operatorname{Ti}_2\left(-(1-\sqrt 2)\right)\right)\]
        </p>

        <hr>

        <p>
            With the same idea one can attempt to calculate the following integral:
        </p>        

        <p>
            \[\int_0^1 \frac{\ln^2 x\ln(1+x)}{1+x^2}dx=?\]
        </p>

        <p>
                Map the bounds from \((0,1)\) to \((0,\infty)\) by substituting \(x\to\frac{1}{x}\) - here it is necessary to add the resulting integral with the original one - afterwards use Feynman's trick.
            </p>

        <hr>

        <h3>
            Multiple parameters
        </h3>

        <p>
            We mostly got familiar to apply Feynman's trick by introducing a parameter somewhere, however sometimes even multiple parameters can be used when encountering new integrals. To exemplify such a situation, let's take a look at the following unit square integral arising in geometric probability:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I=\int_0^1\int_0^1 \left(\frac{-\ln(xy)}{1-xy}\right)^mdxdy\]
        </p>

        <p>
            In order to generate the \(\ln(xy)\) part it's straightforward to consider the following integral:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I(a)=\int_0^1\int_0^1 \frac{(xy)^a}{(1-xy)^m}dxdy\]
        </p>

        <p>
            Differentiating with respect to \(a\), \(m\) times followed by setting \(a=0\) will gives us the desired integral, ignoring the \((-1)^m\) term. However the denominator is still troublesome, and to deal with that we will introduce one more parameter:
        </p>
            
        <p>
            \[I(a,z)=\int_0^1\int_0^1 \frac{(xy)^a}{z-xy}dxdy\]
        </p>

        <p>
            This is perfect now, as we can recover our original integral by differentiating with respect to \(a\), \(m\) times, and with respect to \(z\), \(m-1\) times, followed by setting \(a=0\) and respectively \(z=1\) - ignoring some coefficients.
        </p>

        <p>
            One way to evaluate \(I(a,z)\) is to expand the denominator into geometric series as:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I(a,z)=\int_0^1\int_0^1 \frac{(xy)^a}{z-xy}dxdy=\frac{1}{z}\sum_{n=0}^\infty \int_0^1\int_0^1(xy)^a\left(\frac{xy}{z}\right)^ndxdy\]
            \[=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{z^{n+1}}\int_0^1x^{n+a}dx\int_0^1y^{n+a}dy=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{z^{n+2}}\frac{1}{(n+a)^2}\]
        </p>

        <p>
            Now we will take \(m\) derivatives with respect to \(a\) and then set it to \(0\).
        </p>

        <p>
            \[\frac{\partial^m}{\partial a^m}I(a,z) = \int_0^1\int_0^1 \frac{\ln^m(xy)}{z-xy} dxdy =(-1)^m (m+1)!\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{z^{n+2}}\frac{1}{n^{m+2}}\]
        </p>

        <p>
            This can be also rewriten in terms of the polylogarithm function as:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[\int_0^1\int_0^1 \frac{(-\ln(xy))^m}{z-xy} dxdy = (m+1)!\operatorname{Li}_{m+2}\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)\]
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, we can arrive at our original integral by taking \(m-1\) derivatives with respect to \(z\) and setting it to \(1\).
        </p>

        <p>
                \[(-1)^m(m-1)!\int_0^1\int_0^1 \frac{(-\ln(xy))^m}{(1-xy)^m}dxdy=(m+1)!\frac{d^{m-1}}{dz^{m-1}}\operatorname{Li}_{m+2}\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)\bigg|_{z=1}\]
        </p>

        <p>
            Although the derivation from above was the important part since it shows the main idea on how to differentiate in order to produce the desired integral, by using \(\frac{\partial}{\partial z} \operatorname{Li}_n(z) = \frac{\operatorname{Li}_{n-1}(z)}{z}\) the result can be also written, with the help of <a href="https://oeis.org/A094638">OEIS</a>, as:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[\int_0^1\int_0^1 \left(\frac{-\ln(xy)}{1-xy}\right)^m dxdy =m(m+1)\sum_{k=1}^{m-1}|s(m-1,m-k)|\zeta(k+2)\]
        </p>

        <p>
            Where \(s(n,m)\) is the Stirling number of the first kind and \(\zeta(z)\) is the Riemann zeta function.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <p>
            A similar idea can be applied for the following integral:
        </p>        

        <p>
            \[\int_0^\infty \frac{\cos(3x)}{(1+x^2)^4}dx=?\]
        </p>

        <p>
                Make use of a more general integral that was evaluated in the <a href="#chapter4">fourth chapter</a>, namely:
                \[\int_0^\infty \frac{\cos(tx)}{a^2+x^2}dx = \frac{\pi}{2a}e^{-at}\]
                Then differentiate \(3\) times w.r.t. \(a\).
            </p>

        <hr>

        <h3>
            Cascaded Feynman's trick
        </h3>

        <p>
            Sometimes to enable an application of Feynman's trick we needed to actually apply another Feynman's trick. Let's look at the following integral:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I = \int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\int_0^\frac{\pi}{2}\cot x \csc^2 y\ln(\cos y)\ln(1-2\sin x+\sin^2 x\csc^2y)dxdy\] 
        </p>

        <p>
            The first step should be pretty obvious by now, namely to get rid of the trigonometric functions.
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I \overset{\large \sin x\to x \atop  \large \cot y \to y}=-\frac12\int_0^\infty \int_0^1 \frac{\ln\left(1+\frac{1}{y^2}\right)\ln((1-x)^2+x^2y^2)}{x}dxdy\]
        </p>

        <p>
            Now we can notice that we have two logarithms and only one of them contains the \(x\) term, however since the bounds are \((0,1)\) dealing with that integral won't produce much success (as the result would be quite complicated).
        </p>

        <p>
            However we also have the bounds as \((0,\infty)\) for the \(y\) integral, and it would be even better if we could have a single logarithm. To further obtain such a favorable integral form, we can use the following result:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[\int_0^1 \frac{t}{t^2+y^2}dt=\frac12\ln\left(1+\frac{1}{y^2}\right)\] 
            \[\Rightarrow I=-\int_0^\infty \int_0^1 \int_0^1 \frac{t\ln((1-x)^2+x^2y^2)}{x(t^2+y^2)}dtdxdy \]
            \[\overset{y\to ty}=-\int_0^1 \frac{1}{x}\int_0^1 \int_0^\infty \frac{\ln((1-x)^2+x^2t^2y^2)}{1+y^2} dydtdx\]
        </p>

        <hr>

        <p>
            In the <a href="#chapter3">third chapter</a> we saw how it's useful to have a list of integral results. One more such useful integral that tend to appear quite often is:
        </p>

        <p>
            \[\int_0^\infty \frac{\ln(a^2+b^2 x^2)}{1+x^2}dx= \pi \ln(|a|+|b|)\]
        </p>

        <p>
                You can differentiate either \(I(a)\) or \(I(b)\), and even directly employ the accelerated Feynman's trick by writing the logarithm as an integral.
            </p>

        <hr>

        <p>
            Now back to our integral, by using the above result, we can easily finish the integral.
        </p>

        <p>
            \[I=-\pi\int_0^1 \frac{1}{x}\int_0^1 \ln((1-x)+xt)dtdx\]
            \[=\pi\underbrace{\int_0^1 \left(\frac1x+\frac{\ln(1-x)}{x^2}\right)dx}_{\large -1}-\pi\underbrace{\int_0^1\frac{\ln(1-x)}{x}dx}_{\large -\frac{\pi^2}{6}}=\frac{\pi^3}{6}-\pi\]
        </p>

        <hr>

            Although this marks the conclusion of the essay, this isn't a static website, and I might update it when I encounter new interesting integrals that are worth to be shown. So far, the integrals comes from <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/users/515527/zacky?tab=answers">my posts</a> on Mathematics Stack Exchange, combined with some of the most popular integrals - thus you can also check them directly there.
        </p>

        <p>
            For further exercises, I can recommend you to explore math forums and magazines such as Art of Problem Solving, Mathematics Stack Exchange, The American Mathematical Monthly, Crux Mathematicorum, or the Romanian Mathematical Magazine, where dozens of fascinating integrals are often posted or published. Additionally, delving into other fields like Statistics, Physics, or Quantum Physics will present you with many remarkable integrals — some of which might be computed using Feynman's trick.
        </p>

            I would appreciate a notice on my email address (<a href="mailto:rxzacky@gmail.com">rxzacky@gmail.com</a>) in case you find any mistakes or if something feels unclear in this essay - and even better if you have some further ideas or suggestions.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

With <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/LVFS-Fwupd-135-Million-Download">the Linux Vendor Firmware Service serving more than 135 million downloads</a> for Linux users updating their system and device firmware, LVFS has been <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/LVFS-Fair-Use-Quota">working to get more hardware vendors to contribute</a> either engineering resources or directly contributing annual dues as sponsors. Framework Computer is now the first one to have executed an agreement under these new sponsorship efforts.
</p><p>
Red Hat in employing lead developer Richard Hughes has contributed the most to LVFS/Fwupd's success, the Linux Foundation has also hosted the project since it has shifted into their umbrella, AMD's Mario Limonciello is among the significant contributors, and now Framework Computer is a new sponsor to the project.
</p><p>
Richard Hughes posted on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@hughsie/115628170779065489">Mastodon</a> on Friday:
</p><blockquote>"I'm also happy to announce we've got a new sponsor for the LVFS: #Framework
<p>
Although there are about a half a dozen OEMs that have promised to sponsor LVFS, Framework is the first to have actually signed the paperwork."</p></blockquote>
<p>The graphic on the <a href="https://fwupd.org/">Fwupd.org page</a> shows Framework as a Startup Sponsor, which puts them in the ballpark of around $10k USD in annual dues to the project.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2025&amp;image=lvfs_framework" alt="LVFS Framework sponsorship"></p>
<p>Richard Hughes also followed up with a <a href="https://mastodon.social/@hughsie/115628171746383319">comment</a> on the positive impact that Framework has also applied on their suppliers around Fwupd/LVFS support too:
</p><blockquote>"I also wanted to say a huge thanks to Framework, not just for the sponsorship -- but also for the pressure they've put on their suppliers to support fwupd and the LVFS."</blockquote>
<p>Framework has already been <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Fwupd-2.0.14-Released">supporting LVFS/Fwupd with their devices</a> and ensuring good Linux support in general, such as with <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/framework-16-ryzen-ai-300-series">the recent Framework 16 laptop upgrade</a>.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=framework-16-ryzen-ai-300-series&amp;image=framework_16_13_med" alt="Framework 16 upgrade"></p>
<p>Hopefully the sponsorship agreements with the other major OEMs pan out and that these other vendors also continue ramping up in mandating LVFS/Fwupd hardware support for ensuring a better firmware updating experience for Linux customers.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>A zero knowledge proof (ZKP) answers a question without revealing anything more than answer. For example, a digital signature proves your possession of a private key without revealing that key.</p>
<p>Here’s another example, one that’s more concrete than a digital signature. Suppose you have a deck of 52 cards, 13 of each of spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs. If I draw a spade from the deck, I can prove that I drew a spade without showing which card I drew. If I show you that all the hearts, diamonds, and clubs are still in the deck, then you know that the missing card must be a spade.</p>
<h2>Composite numbers</h2>
<p>You can think of Fermat’s primality test as a zero knowledge proof. For example, I can convince you that the following number is composite without telling you what its factors are.</p>
<p><em>n</em> = 244948974278317817239218684105179099697841253232749877148554952030873515325678914498692765804485233435199358326742674280590888061039570247306980857239550402418179621896817000856571932268313970451989041</p>
<p>Fermat’s little theorem&nbsp;says that if&nbsp;<em>n</em>&nbsp;is a prime and&nbsp;<em>b</em>&nbsp;is not a multiple of&nbsp;<em>n</em>, then</p>
<p><em>b</em><sup><em>n</em>−1</sup>&nbsp;= 1 (mod&nbsp;<em>n</em>).</p>
<p>A number&nbsp;<em>b</em> such that <em>b</em><sup><em>n</em>−1</sup>&nbsp;≠ 1 (mod&nbsp;<em>n</em>) is a proof that&nbsp;<em>n</em> is not prime, i.e. <em>n</em> is composite. So, for example,&nbsp;<em>b</em> = 2 is a proof that&nbsp;<em>n</em> above is composite. This can be verified very quickly using Python:</p>
<pre>    &gt;&gt;&gt; pow(2, n-1, n)
    10282 ... 4299
</pre>
<p>I tried the smallest possible base [1] and it worked. In general you may have to try a few bases. And for a few rare numbers (Carmichael numbers) you won’t be able to find a base. But if you do find a base <em>b</em> such that <em>b</em><sup><em>n</em>−1</sup> is not congruent to 1 mod&nbsp;<em>n</em>, you know with&nbsp;<strong>certainty</strong> that&nbsp;<em>b</em> is composite.</p>
<h2>Prime numbers</h2>
<p>The converse of Fermat’s little theorem is false. It can be used to prove a number is&nbsp;<em>not</em> prime, but it cannot prove that a number&nbsp;<em>is</em> prime. But it can be used to show that a number is&nbsp;<strong>probably</strong> prime. (There’s some subtlety as to what it means for a number to probably be prime. See <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/10/06/probability-a-number-is-prime/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Fermat’s little theorem can give you a zero knowledge proof that a number is composite. Can it give you a zero knowledge proof that a number is prime? There are a couple oddities in this question.</p>
<p>First, what would it mean to have a zero knowledge proof that a number is prime? What knowledge are you keeping secret? When you prove that a number is composite, the prime factors are secret (or even unknown), but what’s the secret when you say a number is prime? Strictly speaking a ZKP doesn’t have to keep anything secret, but in practice it always does.</p>
<p>Second, what about the probability of error? Zero knowledge proofs do not have to be infallible. A ZKP can have some negligible probability of error, and usually do.</p>
<p>It’s not part of the definition, but n practice ZKPs are supposed to be easier to verify than the direct approach to what they prove. So you could have something like a <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2023/01/03/pratt-certificate/">primality certificate</a> that takes far less computation to verify than the computation needed to determine from scratch that a number is prime.</p>
<h2>Proving other things</h2>
<p>You could think of non-constructive proofs as ZKPs. For example, you could think of the intermediate value theorem as a ZKP: it proves that a function has a zero in an interval without giving you any information about where that zero may be located.</p>
<p>What makes ZKPs interesting in application is that they can prove things of more general interest than mathematical statements [2]. For example, cryptocurrencies can provide ZKPs that accounting constraints hold without revealing the inputs or outputs of the transaction. You could prove that nobody tried to spend a negative amount and that the sum of the inputs equals the sum of the outputs.</p>

<p>[1] You could try&nbsp;<em>b</em> = 1, but then <em>b</em><sup><em>n</em>−1</sup> is always 1. This example shows that the existence of a base for which <em>b</em><sup><em>n</em>−1</sup> = 1 (mod&nbsp;<em>n</em>) doesn’t prove anything.</p>
<p>[2] You might object that accounting rules are mathematical statements, and of course they are. But they’re of little interest to mathematicians and of great interest to the parties in a transaction.</p>
