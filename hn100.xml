<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Jan.  28, 2026, 3:09 p.m.</p><p>Outlets like The Guardian and The New York Times are scrutinizing digital archives as potential backdoors for AI crawlers.</p><div id="content_div-247528">


<p>As part of its mission to preserve the web, the Internet Archive operates crawlers that capture webpage snapshots. Many of these snapshots are accessible through its public-facing tool, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a>. But as AI bots scavenge the web for training data to feed their models, the Internet Archive’s commitment to free information access has turned its digital library into a potential liability for some news publishers.</p>
<p>When The Guardian took a look at who was trying to extract its content, access logs revealed that the Internet Archive was a frequent crawler, said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-hahn-08b45719/">Robert Hahn</a>, head of business affairs and licensing. The publisher decided to limit the Internet Archive’s access to published articles, minimizing the chance that AI companies might scrape its content via the nonprofit’s repository of over one trillion webpage snapshots.</p>

<p>Specifically, Hahn said The Guardian has taken steps to exclude itself from the Internet Archive’s APIs and filter out its article pages from the Wayback Machine’s URLs interface. The Guardian’s regional homepages, topic pages, and other landing pages will continue to appear in the Wayback Machine.</p>
<p>In particular, Hahn expressed concern about the <a href="https://archive.org/help/wayback_api.php">Internet Archive’s APIs</a>. </p>
<p>“A lot of these AI businesses are looking for readily available, structured databases of content,” he said. “The Internet Archive’s API would have been an obvious place to plug their own machines into and suck out the IP.” (He admits the Wayback Machine itself is “less risky,” since the data is not as well-structured.)</p>
<p>As news publishers try to safeguard their contents from AI companies, the Internet Archive is also getting caught in the crosshairs. The Financial Times, for example, blocks any bot that tries to scrape its paywalled content, including bots from OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, and the Internet Archive. The majority of FT stories are paywalled, according to director of global public policy and platform strategy <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattrogerson/">Matt Rogerson</a>. As a result, usually only unpaywalled FT stories appear in the Wayback Machine because those are meant to be available to the wider public anyway.</p>
<p>“Common Crawl and Internet Archive are widely considered to be the ‘good guys’ and are used by ‘the bad guys’ like OpenAI,” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaellloydnelson/">said Michael Nelson</a>, a computer scientist and professor at Old Dominion University. “In everyone’s aversion to not be controlled by LLMs, I think the good guys are collateral damage.”</p>

<p>The Guardian hasn’t documented specific instances of its webpages being scraped by AI companies via the Wayback Machine. Instead, it’s taking these measures proactively and is working directly with the Internet Archive to implement the changes. Hahn says the organization has been receptive to The Guardian’s concerns.</p>
<p>The outlet stopped short of an all-out block on the Internet Archive’s crawlers, Hahn said, because it supports the nonprofit’s mission to democratize information, though that position remains under review as part of its routine bot management. </p>
<p>“[The decision] was much more about compliance and a backdoor threat to our content,” he said.</p>
<p>When asked about The Guardian’s decision, Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle said that “if publishers limit libraries, like the Internet Archive, then the public will have less access to the historical record.” It’s a prospect, he implied, that could undercut the organization’s work countering “<a href="https://firstdraftnews.org/training/information-disorder/">information disorder</a>.”</p>

<p>The Guardian isn’t alone in reevaluating its relationship to the Internet Archive. The New York Times confirmed to Nieman Lab that it’s actively “hard blocking” the Internet Archive’s crawlers. At the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251223163226/http://nytimes.com/robots.txt" target="_blank">end of 2025</a>, the Times also added one of those crawlers — archive.org_bot — to its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/robots.txt" target="_blank">robots.txt file</a>, disallowing access to its content.</p>
<p>“We believe in the value of The New York Times’s human-led journalism and always want to ensure that our IP is being accessed and used lawfully,” said a Times spokesperson. “We are blocking the Internet Archive’s bot from accessing the Times because the Wayback Machine provides unfettered access to Times content — including by AI companies — without authorization.”</p>
<p>Last August, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/757538/reddit-internet-archive-wayback-machine-block-limit">Reddit announced</a> that it would block the Internet Archive, whose digital libraries include countless archived Reddit forums, comments sections, and profiles. This content is not unlike what Reddit now licenses to <a href="https://www.cjr.org/analysis/reddit-winning-ai-licensing-deals-openai-google-gemini-answers-rsl.php">Google as AI training data for tens of millions of dollars</a>.</p>
<p>“[The] Internet Archive provides a service to the open web, but we’ve been made aware of instances where AI companies violate platform policies, including ours, and scrape data from the Wayback Machine,” a Reddit spokesperson <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/757538/reddit-internet-archive-wayback-machine-block-limit">told The Verge</a> at the time. “Until they’re able to defend their site and comply with platform policies…we’re limiting some of their access to Reddit data to protect redditors.”</p>
<p>Kahle has also alluded to steps the Internet Archive is taking to restrict bulk access to its libraries. In a <a href="https://mastodon.archive.org/@brewsterkahle/115368911896794707">Mastodon post</a> last fall, he wrote that “there are many collections that are available to users but not for bulk downloading. We use internal rate-limiting systems, filtering mechanisms, and network security services such as Cloudflare.”</p>
<p>Currently, however, the Internet Archive does not disallow any specific crawlers through its robots.txt file, including those of major AI companies. As of January 12, the robots.txt file for <a href="http://archive.org/">archive.org</a> read: “​​Welcome to the Archive! Please crawl our files. We appreciate it if you can crawl responsibly. Stay open!” Shortly after we inquired about this language, it was changed. The file now reads, simply, “Welcome to the Internet Archive!”</p>

<p>There is evidence that the Wayback Machine, generally speaking, has been used to train LLMs in the past. An <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/ai-chatbot-learning/">analysis of Google’s C4 dataset</a> by the Washington Post in 2023 showed that the Internet Archive was among millions of websites in the training data used to build Google’s T5 model and Meta’s Llama models. Out of the 15 million domains in the C4 dataset, the domain for the Wayback Machine (<a href="http://web.archive.org/">web.archive.org</a>) was ranked as the 187th most present.</p>
<p>In May 2023, the Internet Archive went <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2023/05/29/let-us-serve-you-but-dont-bring-us-down/">offline</a> temporarily after an AI company caused a server overload, Wayback Machine director <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/markjohngraham/">Mark Graham</a> told Nieman Lab this past fall. The company sent tens of thousands of requests per second from virtual hosts on Amazon Web Services to extract text data from the nonprofit’s public domain archives. The Internet Archive blocked the hosts twice before putting out a public call to “respectfully” scrape its site.</p>
<p>“We got in contact with them. They ended up giving us a donation,” Graham said. “They ended up saying that they were sorry and they stopped doing it.”</p>
<p>“Those wanting to use our materials in bulk should start slowly, and ramp up,” <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2023/05/29/let-us-serve-you-but-dont-bring-us-down/">wrote Kahle in a blog post</a> shortly after the incident. “Also, if you are starting a large project please contact us …we are here to help.”</p>
<p>The Guardian’s moves to limit the Internet Archive’s access made us wonder whether other news publishers were taking similar actions. We looked at publishers’ robots.txt pages as a way to measure potential concern over the Internet Archive’s crawling.</p>
<p>A website’s robots.txt page tells bots which parts of the site they can crawl, acting like a “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRlQ965pGCA&amp;t=0">doorman</a>,” telling visitors who is and isn’t allowed in the house and which parts are off limits. Robots.txt pages aren’t legally binding, so the companies running crawling bots aren’t obligated to comply with them, but they indicate where the Internet Archive is unwelcome.</p>
<p>For example, in addition to “hard blocking,” The New York Times and The Athletic include the archive.org_bot in their robots.txt file, though they do not currently disallow other bots operated by the Internet Archive. </p>
<p>To explore this issue, Nieman Lab used journalist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/palewire/">Ben Welsh</a>‘s <a href="https://palewi.re/docs/news-homepages/openai-gptbot-robotstxt.html">database of 1,167 news websites</a> as a starting point. As part of a larger side project to archive news sites’ homepages, Welsh runs crawlers that regularly scrape the robots.txt files of the outlets in his database. In late December, we downloaded a spreadsheet from Welsh’s site that displayed all the bots disallowed in the robots.txt files of those sites. We identified four bots that the AI user agent watchdog service <a href="https://darkvisitors.com/">Dark Visitors</a> has associated with the Internet Archive. (The Internet Archive did not respond to requests to confirm its ownership of these bots.) </p>
<p>This data is not comprehensive, but exploratory. It does not represent global, industry-wide trends — 76% of sites in the Welsh’s publisher list are based in the U.S., for example — but instead begins to shed light on which publishers are less eager to have their content crawled by the Internet Archive.</p>
<p>In total, 241 news sites from nine countries explicitly disallow at least one out of the four Internet Archive crawling bots. </p>
<p>Most of those sites (87%) are owned by USA Today Co., the largest newspaper conglomerate in the United States formerly known as Gannett. (Gannett sites only make up 18% of Welsh’s original publishers list.) Each Gannett-owned outlet in our dataset disallows the same two bots: “archive.org_bot” and “ia_archiver-web.archive.org”. These bots were added to the robots.txt files of Gannett-owned publications in 2025.</p>
<p>Some Gannett sites have also taken stronger measures to guard their contents from Internet Archive crawlers. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260000000000*/desmoinesregister.com">URL searches for the Des Moines Register in the Wayback Machine</a> return a message that says, “Sorry. This URL has been excluded from the Wayback Machine.”</p>
<p>“USA Today Co. has consistently emphasized the importance of safeguarding our content and intellectual property,” a company spokesperson said via email. “Last year, we introduced new protocols to deter unauthorized data collection and scraping, redirecting such activity to a designated <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/bot-detection">page</a> outlining our licensing requirements.”</p>
<p>Gannett declined to comment further on its relationship with the Internet Archive. In an October 2025 <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-gannett-cos-q3-2025-digital-focus-amid-revenue-dip-93CH-4320263">earnings call</a>, CEO Mike Reed spoke to the company’s anti-scraping measures. </p>
<p>“In September alone, we blocked 75 million AI bots across our local and USA Today platforms, the vast majority of which were seeking to scrape our local content,” Reed said on that call. “About 70 million of those came from OpenAI.” (<a href="https://www.usatodayco.com/pr/gannett-i-usa-today-network-and-perplexity-announce-strategic-ai-content-licensing-ageement/#:~:text=Gannett%20I%20USA%20TODAY%20Network,available%20for%20a%20broader%20audience.">Gannett signed a content licensing agreement with Perplexity in July 2025</a>.)</p>
<p>About 93% (226 sites) of publishers in our dataset disallow two out of the four Internet Archive bots we identified. Three news sites in the sample disallow three Internet Archive crawlers: Le Huffington Post, Le Monde, and Le Monde in English, all of which are owned by Group Le Monde.</p>

<p>The news sites in our sample aren’t only targeting the Internet Archive. Out of the 241 sites that disallow at least one of the four Internet Archive bots in our sample, 240 sites disallow Common Crawl — another nonprofit internet preservation project that has been <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-fight-against-ai-comes-to-a-foundational-data-set/">more closely linked to commercial LLM development</a>. Of our sample, 231 sites all disallow bots operated by OpenAI, Google AI, and Common Crawl.</p>
<p>As we’ve <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2025/10/the-wayback-machines-snapshots-of-news-homepages-plummet-after-a-breakdown-in-archiving-projects/">previously reported</a>, the Internet Archive has taken on the Herculean task of preserving the internet, and many news organizations aren’t equipped to save their own work. In December, Poynter <a href="https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2025/poynter-ire-and-internet-archive-launch-todays-news-for-tomorrow-a-project-to-help-newsrooms-preserve-their-digital-footprint/">announced</a> a joint initiative with the Internet Archive to train local news outlets on how to preserve their content. Archiving initiatives like this, while urgently needed, are  few and far between. Since there is no federal mandate that requires internet content to be preserved, the Internet Archive is the most robust archiving initiative in the United States.</p>
<p>“The Internet Archive tends to be good citizens,” Hahn said. “It’s the law of unintended consequences: You do something for really good purposes, and it gets abused.”</p>

<p>Pressure is mounting on tech companies to shield users from unlawful government requests that advocates say are making it harder to reliably share information about Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) online.</p>
<p>Alleging that ICE officers are being doxed or otherwise endangered, Trump officials have spent the last year targeting an unknown number of users and platforms with demands to censor content. Early lawsuits show that platforms have caved, even though experts say they could refuse these demands without a court order.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.thefire.org/sites/default/files/2026/02/Verified%20Complaint%20-%20Rosado%20v.%20Bondi.pdf">lawsuit</a> filed on Wednesday, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) accused Attorney General Pam Bondi and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem of coercing tech companies into removing a wide range of content “to control what the public can see, hear, or say about ICE operations.”</p>
<p>It’s the second lawsuit alleging that Bondi and DHS officials are using regulatory power to pressure private platforms to suppress speech protected by the First Amendment. It follows a complaint <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/iceblock-lawsuit-trump-admin-bragged-about-demanding-app-store-removal/">from the developer of an app called ICEBlock</a>, which Apple removed from the App Store in October. Officials aren’t rushing to resolve that case—last month, they requested more time to respond—so it may remain unclear until March what defense they plan to offer for the takedown demands.</p>
<p>That leaves community members who monitor ICE in a precarious situation, as critical resources could disappear at the department’s request with no warning.</p>
<p>FIRE says people have legitimate reasons to share information about ICE. Some communities focus on helping people avoid dangerous ICE activity, while others aim to hold the government accountable and raise public awareness of how ICE operates. Unless there’s proof of incitement to violence or a true threat, such expression is protected.</p>

<p>Despite the high bar for censoring online speech, lawsuits trace an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/instagram-user-fights-dhs-for-the-right-to-post-ice-sightings-anonymously/">escalating pattern</a> of DHS increasingly targeting websites, app stores, and platforms—many that have been willing to remove content the government dislikes.</p>
<p>Officials have ordered <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/apple-bends-to-trump-admin-demand-to-remove-ice-tracking-apps-like-iceblock/">ICE-monitoring apps to be removed from app stores</a> and even <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.285233/gov.uscourts.dcd.285233.1.0_1.pdf">threatened to sanction CNN</a> for simply reporting on the existence of one such app. Officials have also demanded that Meta delete at least one Chicago-based Facebook group with 100,000 members and made <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/01/instagram-ice-critic-wins-fight-to-stay-anonymous-as-dhs-backs-down/">multiple unsuccessful attempts</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/trump-admin-pressured-facebook-into-removing-ice-tracking-group/">unmask anonymous users behind other Facebook groups</a>. Even encrypted apps like Signal don’t feel safe from officials’ seeming overreach. FBI Director Kash Patel recently said he has opened an investigation into Signal chats used by Minnesota residents to track ICE activity, NBC News&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/fbi-investigating-minnesota-signal-minneapolis-group-ice-patel-kash-rcna256041" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>.</p>
<p>As DHS censorship threats increase, platforms have done little to shield users, advocates say. Not only have they sometimes failed to reject unlawful orders that simply provided a “a bare mention of ‘officer safety/doxing'” as justification, but in one case, Google complied with a subpoena that left a critical section blank, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/open-letter-tech-companies-must-resist-unlawful-subpoenas-user-data">reported</a>.</p>
<p>For users, it’s increasingly difficult to trust that platforms won’t betray their own policies when faced with government intimidation, advocates say. Sometimes platforms notify users before complying with government requests, giving users a chance to challenge potentially unconstitutional demands. But in other cases, users learn about the requests only as platforms comply with them—even when those platforms have promised that would never happen.</p>
<h2>Government emails with platforms may be exposed</h2>
<p>Platforms could face backlash from users if lawsuits expose their communications to the government, a possibility in the coming months. Last fall, the EFF sued after DOJ, DHS, ICE, and Customs and Border Patrol failed to respond to Freedom of Information Act requests seeking emails between the government and platforms about takedown demands. Other lawsuits may surface emails in discovery. In the coming weeks, a judge will set a schedule for EFF’s litigation.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
            
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>“The nature and content of the Defendants’ communications with these technology companies” is “critical for determining whether they crossed the line from governmental cajoling to unconstitutional coercion,” EFF’s <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/EFF-v-DOJ-Complaint-11-20-25.pdf">complaint</a> said.</p>
<p>EFF Senior Staff Attorney Mario Trujillo told Ars that the EFF is confident it can win the fight to expose government demands, but like most FOIA lawsuits, the case is expected to move slowly. That’s unfortunate, he said, because ICE activity is escalating, and delays in addressing these concerns could irreparably harm speech at a pivotal moment.</p>

<p>Like users, platforms are seemingly victims, too, FIRE senior attorney Colin McDonnell told Ars.</p>
<p>They’ve been forced to override their own editorial judgment while navigating implicit threats from the government, he said.</p>
<p>“If Attorney General Bondi demands that they remove speech, the platform is going to feel like they have to comply; they don’t have a choice,” McDonnell said.</p>
<p>But platforms do have a choice and could be doing more to protect users, the EFF has said. Platforms could even serve as a first line of defense, requiring officials to get a court order before complying with any requests.</p>
<p>Platforms may now have good reason to push back against government requests—and to give users the tools to do the same. Trujillo noted that while courts have been slow to address the ICEBlock removal and FOIA lawsuits, the government has quickly withdrawn requests to unmask Facebook users soon after litigation began.</p>
<p>“That’s like an acknowledgement that the Trump administration, when actually challenged in court, wasn’t even willing to defend itself,” Trujillo said.</p>
<p>Platforms could view that as evidence that government pressure only works when platforms fail to put up a bare-minimum fight, Trujillo said.</p>

<h2>Platforms “bend over backward” to appease DHS</h2>
<p>An <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/open-letter-tech-companies-must-resist-unlawful-subpoenas-user-data">open letter</a> from the EFF and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) documented two instances of tech companies complying with government demands without first notifying users.</p>
<p>The letter called out Meta for unmasking at least one user without prior notice, which groups noted “potentially” occured due to a “technical glitch.”</p>
<p>More troubling than buggy notifications, however, is the possibility that platforms may be routinely delaying notice until it’s too late.</p>
<p>After Google “received an ICE subpoena for user data and fulfilled it on the same day that it notified the user,” the company admitted that “sometimes when Google misses its response deadline, it complies with the subpoena and provides notice to a user at the same time to minimize the delay for an overdue production,” the letter said.</p>
<p>“This is a worrying admission that violates [Google’s] clear promise to users, especially because there is no legal consequence to missing the government’s response deadline,” the letter said.</p>
<p>Platforms face no sanctions for refusing to comply with government demands that have not been court-ordered, the letter noted. That’s why the EFF and ACLU have urged companies to use their “immense resources” to shield users who may not be able to drop everything and fight unconstitutional data requests.</p>
<p>In their letter, the groups asked companies to insist on court intervention before complying with a DHS subpoena. They should also resist DHS “gag orders” that ask platforms to hand over data without notifying users.</p>
<p>Instead, they should commit to giving users “as much notice as possible when they are the target of a subpoena,” as well as a copy of the subpoena. Ideally, platforms would also link users to legal aid resources and take up legal fights on behalf of vulnerable users, advocates suggested.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
            
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>That’s not what’s happening so far. Trujillo told Ars that it feels like “companies have bent over backward to appease the Trump administration.”</p>
<p>The tide could turn this year if courts side with app makers behind crowdsourcing apps <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/12/iceblock-lawsuit-trump-admin-bragged-about-demanding-app-store-removal/">like ICEBlock</a> and Eyes Up, who are suing to end the alleged government coercion. FIRE’s McDonnell, who represents the creator of Eyes Up, told Ars that platforms may feel more comfortable exercising their own editorial judgment moving forward if a court declares they were coerced into removing content.</p>
<h2>DHS can’t use doxing to dodge First Amendment</h2>
<p>FIRE’s lawsuit accuses Bondi and Noem of coercing Meta to disable a Facebook group with 100,000 members called “ICE Sightings–Chicagoland.”</p>
<p>The popularity of that group surged during “Operation Midway Blitz,” when hundreds of agents arrested more than 4,500 people over weeks of raids that used tear gas in neighborhoods and caused car crashes and other violence. Arrests included US citizens and immigrants of lawful status, which “gave Chicagoans reason to fear being injured or arrested due to their proximity to ICE raids, no matter their immigration status,” FIRE’s complaint said.</p>

<p>Kassandra Rosado, a lifelong Chicagoan and US citizen of Mexican descent, started the Facebook group and served as admin, moderating content with other volunteers. She prohibited “hate speech or bullying” and “instructed group members not to post anything threatening, hateful, or that promoted violence or illegal conduct.”</p>
<p>Facebook only ever flagged five posts that supposedly violated community guidelines, but in warnings, the company reassured Rosado that “groups aren’t penalized when members or visitors break the rules without admin approval.”</p>
<p>Rosado had no reason to suspect that her group was in danger of removal. When Facebook disabled her group, it told Rosado the group violated community standards “multiple times.” But her complaint noted that, confusingly, “Facebook policies don’t provide for disabling groups if a few members post ostensibly prohibited content; they call for removing groups when the group moderator repeatedly either creates prohibited content or affirmatively ‘approves’ such content.”</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
            
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Facebook’s decision came after a right-wing influencer, Laura Loomer, tagged Noem and Bondi in a social media post alleging that the group was “getting people killed.” Within two days, Bondi bragged that she had gotten the group disabled while claiming that it “was being used to dox and target [ICE] agents in Chicago.”</p>
<p>McDonnell told Ars it seems clear that Bondi selectively uses the term “doxing” when people post images from ICE arrests. He pointed to “ICE’s own social media accounts,” which share favorable opinions of ICE alongside videos and photos of ICE arrests that Bondi doesn’t consider doxing.</p>
<p>“Rosado’s creation of Facebook groups to send and receive information about where and how ICE carries out its duties in public, to share photographs and videos of ICE carrying out its duties in public, and to exchange opinions about and criticism of ICE’s tactics in carrying out its duties, is speech protected by the First Amendment,” FIRE argued.</p>
<p>The same goes for speech managed by Mark Hodges, a US citizen who resides in Indiana. He created an app called Eyes Up to serve as an archive of ICE videos. Apple removed Eyes Up from the App Store around the same time that it removed ICEBlock.</p>
<p>“It is just videos of what government employees did in public carrying out their duties,” McDonnell said. “It’s nothing even close to threatening or doxing or any of these other theories that the government has used to justify suppressing speech.”</p>
<p>Bondi bragged that she had gotten ICEBlock banned, and FIRE’s complaint confirmed that Hodges’ company received the same notification that ICEBlock’s developer got after Bondi’s victory lap. The notice said that Apple received “information” from “law enforcement” claiming that the apps had violated Apple guidelines against “defamatory, discriminatory, or mean-spirited content.”</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
            
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Apple did not reach the same conclusion when it independently reviewed Eyes Up prior to government meddling, FIRE’s complaint said. Notably, the app remains available in Google Play, and Rosado now manages a new Facebook group with similar content but somewhat tighter restrictions on who can join. Neither activity has required urgent intervention from either tech giants or the government.</p>
<p>McDonnell told Ars that it’s harmful for DHS to water down the meaning of doxing when pushing platforms to remove content critical of ICE.</p>
<p>“When most of us hear the word ‘doxing,’ we think of something that’s threatening, posting private information along with home addresses or places of work,” McDonnell said. “And it seems like the government is expanding that definition to encompass just sharing, even if there’s no threats, nothing violent. Just sharing information about what our government is doing.”</p>
<p>Expanding the definition and then using that term to justify suppressing speech is concerning, he said, especially since the First Amendment includes no exception for “doxing,” even if DHS ever were to provide evidence of it.</p>
<p>To suppress speech, officials must show that groups are inciting violence or making true threats. FIRE has alleged that the government has not met “the extraordinary justifications required for a prior restraint” on speech and is instead using vague doxing threats to discriminate against speech based on viewpoint. They’re seeking a permanent injunction barring officials from coercing tech companies into censoring ICE posts.</p>
<p>If plaintiffs win, the censorship threats could subside, and tech companies may feel safe reinstating apps and Facebook groups, advocates told Ars. That could potentially revive archives documenting thousands of ICE incidents and reconnect webs of ICE watchers who lost access to valued feeds.</p>
<p>Until courts possibly end threats of censorship, the most cautious community members are moving local ICE-watch efforts to group chats and listservs that are harder for the government to disrupt, Trujillo told Ars.</p>

    <h2>Vim 9.2 is available</h2>
    <p><img src="https://www.vim.org/images/vim92_logo.svg" width="500">
    </p>
    <p>The Vim project is happy to announce that Vim 9.2 has been released.</p>
    <p>Vim 9.2 brings significant enhancements to the Vim9 scripting language, improved diff mode, comprehensive completion features, and platform-specific improvements including experimental Wayland support.</p>

    <h2>New Features in Vim 9.2</h2>
    <ul>
	<li><strong>Comprehensive Completion:</strong> Added support for <strong>fuzzy matching</strong> during insert-mode completion and the ability to complete words directly from <strong>registers</strong> (<code>CTRL-X CTRL-R</code>). New <code>'completeopt'</code> flags like <code>nosort</code> and <code>nearest</code> offer finer control over how matches are displayed and ordered.</li>
	
	<li><strong>Modern Platform Support:</strong> Full support for the <strong>Wayland</strong> UI and clipboard has been added. On Linux and Unix-like systems, Vim now adheres to the <strong>XDG Base Directory Specification</strong>, using <code>$HOME/.config/vim</code> for user configuration.</li>
	
	<li><strong>UI Enhancements:</strong> A new <strong>vertical tabpanel</strong> provides an alternative to the horizontal tabline. The <strong>MS-Windows</strong> GUI now supports native dark mode for the menu and title bars, along with improved fullscreen support and higher-quality toolbar icons.</li>
	
	<li><strong>Interactive Learning:</strong> A new built-in <strong>interactive tutor plugin</strong> (started via <code>:Tutor</code>) provides a modernized learning experience beyond the traditional vimtutor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Vim9 Script Evolution</h2>
    <p>Significant language enhancements including native support for <strong>Enums</strong>, <strong>Generic functions</strong>, and the <strong>Tuple</strong> data type. Built-in functions are now integrated as <strong>object methods</strong>, and classes now support protected <code>_new()</code> methods and <code>:defcompile</code> for full method compilation.</p>

    <div>
	<h2>Vim9 Script Ecosystem &amp; AI Integration</h2>
	<p>The maturity of Vim9 script's modern constructs is now being leveraged by advanced AI development tools. Contributor Yegappan Lakshmanan recently demonstrated the efficacy of these new features through two projects generated using GitHub Copilot:</p>

	<ul>
	    <li><strong>Battleship in Vim9:</strong> A complete implementation of the classic game, showcasing classes and type aliases. [<a href="https://github.com/yegappan/battleship.git">GitHub</a>]</li>
	    <li><strong>Number Puzzle:</strong> A logic game demonstrating the efficiency of modern Vim9 for interactive plugins. [<a href="https://github.com/yegappan/number-puzzle">GitHub</a>]</li>
	</ul>
    </div>	

    <h2>Diff Improvements</h2>
    <p>Vim 9.2 introduces significant enhancements to how changes are visualized and aligned in diff mode:</p>

    <ul>
	<li><strong>Linematch Algorithm:</strong> Includes the "linematch" algorithm for the <code>'diffopt'</code> setting. This aligns changes between buffers on similar lines, greatly improving diff highlighting accuracy.</li>
	<li><strong>Diff Anchors:</strong> The new <code>'diffanchors'</code> option allows you to specify anchor points (comma-separated addresses) to split and independently diff buffer sections, ensuring better alignment in complex files.</li>
	<li><strong>Inline Highlighting:</strong> Improves highlighting for changes within a line. This is configurable via the <code>"inline"</code> sub-option for <code>'diffopt'</code>. Note that <code>"inline:simple"</code> has been added to the default <code>'diffopt'</code> value.</li>
    </ul><p>
    Here are some examples for the improved inline highlighting:

	</p></div>
    </div>

<h2>Changed Default Values</h2>
<p>Several long-standing defaults have been updated to better suit modern hardware and workflows. These values have been removed from <code>defaults.vim</code> as they are now the internal defaults.</p>

    <h2>Completion Feature Examples</h2>
    <p>These examples demonstrate how to use the powerful new completion and introspection tools available in Vim 9.2.</p>

    <div>
    <h3>1. Auto-completion</h3>
    <p>Vim's standard completion frequently checks for user input while searching for new matches. It is responsive irrespective of file size. This makes it well-suited for smooth auto-completion.</p>
    <pre><code>vim9script
def InsComplete()
    if getcharstr(1) == '' &amp;&amp; getline('.')-&gt;strpart(0, col('.') - 1) =~ '\k$'
        SkipTextChangedIEvent()
        feedkeys("\&lt;c-n&gt;", "n")
    endif
enddef

def SkipTextChangedIEvent(): string
    # Suppress next event caused by &lt;c-e&gt; (or &lt;c-n&gt; when no matches found)
    set eventignore+=TextChangedI
    timer_start(1, (_) =&gt; {
        set eventignore-=TextChangedI
    })
    return ''
enddef

set cot=menuone,popup,noselect inf

autocmd TextChangedI * InsComplete()

inoremap &lt;silent&gt; &lt;c-e&gt; &lt;c-r&gt;=&lt;SID&gt;SkipTextChangedIEvent()&lt;cr&gt;&lt;c-e&gt;

    <h2>Charity: Transition to Kuwasha</h2>
    <p>For over 30 years, Vim has been "Charityware," supporting children in Kibaale, Uganda. Following the passing of Bram Moolenaar, the ICCF Holland foundation was dissolved, and its mission has been carried forward by a new partner.</p>

    <ul>
	<li><strong>ICCF Holland Dissolution:</strong> Because the charity could not be sustained in its original form without Bram, ICCF Holland was dissolved and its remaining funds were transferred to ensure continued support for the Kibaale project.</li>
	<li><strong>Partnership with Kuwasha:</strong> To ensure that aid remained uninterrupted, all sponsorship activities were moved to <a href="https://www.kuwasha.net/ways-to-give/">Kuwasha</a>, a long-term partner based in Canada that now manages the projects in Uganda.</li>
	<li><strong>Continuing the Legacy:</strong> Vim remains Charityware. We encourage users to continue supporting the needy children in Uganda through this new transition.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For information on how to support this cause, please visit the <a href="https://www.vim.org/sponsor/index.php">Sponsor page</a>.</p>
    <h2>Appreciation</h2>
    <p>We would like to thank everybody who contributed to the project through patches, translations, and bug reports. We are very grateful for any support.</p>

    <p>I recently got a smart sleep mask from Kickstarter. I was not expecting to end up with the ability to read strangers' brainwaves and send them electric impulses in their sleep. But here we are.</p>
<p>The mask was from a small Chinese research company, very cool hardware -- EEG brain monitoring, electrical muscle stimulation around the eyes, vibration, heating, audio. The app was still rough around the edges though and the mask kept disconnecting, so I asked Claude to try reverse-engineer the Bluetooth protocol and build me a simple web control panel instead.</p>
<h3 id="bluetooth">Bluetooth</h3><p>The first thing Claude did was scan for BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) devices nearby. It found mine among 35 devices in range, connected, and mapped the interface -- two data channels. One for sending commands, one for streaming data.</p>
<p>Then it tried talking to it. Sent maybe a hundred different command patterns. Modbus frames, JSON, raw bytes, common headers. Unfortunately, the device said nothing back, the protocol was not a standard one.</p>
<h3 id="the-app">The app</h3><p>So Claude went after the app instead. Grabbed the Android APK, decompiled it with jadx. Turns out the app is built with Flutter, which is a bit of a problem for reverse engineering. Flutter compiles Dart source code into native ARM64 machine code -- you can't just read it back like normal Java Android apps. The actual business logic lives in a 9MB binary blob.</p>
<p>But even compiled binaries have strings in them. Error messages, URLs, debug logs. Claude ran <code>strings</code> on the binary and this was the most productive step of the whole session. Among the thousands of lines of Flutter framework noise, it found:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardcoded credentials for the company's message broker (shared by every copy of the app)</li>
<li>Cloud API endpoints</li>
<li>All fifteen command builder function names (e.g. to set vibration, heating, electric stimulation, etc.)</li>
<li>Protocol debug messages that revealed the packet structure -- header, direction byte, command type, payload, footer</li>
</ul>
<p>We had the shape of the protocol. Still didn't have the actual byte values though.</p>
<p>Claude then used <a href="https://github.com/worawit/blutter">blutter</a>, a tool specifically for decompiling Flutter's compiled Dart snapshots. It reconstructs the functions with readable annotations. Claude figured out the encoding, and just read off every command byte from every function. Fifteen commands, fully mapped.</p>
<h3 id="it-works">It works</h3><p>Claude sent a six-byte query packet. The device came back with 153 bytes -- model number, firmware version, serial number, all eight sensor channel configurations (EEG at 250Hz, respiration, 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope). Battery at 83%.</p>
<p>Vibration control worked. Heating worked. EMS worked. Music worked. Claude built me a little web dashboard with sliders for everything. I was pretty happy with it.</p>
<p>That could have been the end of the story.</p>
<h3 id="the-server">The server</h3><p>Remember the hardcoded credentials from earlier? While poking around, Claude tried using them to connect to the company's MQTT broker -- MQTT is a pub/sub messaging system standard in IoT, where devices publish sensor readings and subscribe to commands. It connected fine. Then it started receiving data. Not just from my device -- from <em>all of them</em>. About 25 were active:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sleep masks publishing live EEG brainwave data</li>
<li>Air quality monitors reporting temperature, humidity, CO2</li>
<li>Presence sensors detecting room occupancy</li>
</ul>
<p>Claude captured a couple minutes of EEG from two active sleep masks. One user seemed to be in REM sleep (mixed-frequency activity). The other was in deep slow-wave sleep (strong delta power below 4Hz). Real brainwaves from real people, somewhere in the world.</p>
<p><img src="https://hatzistamou.com/img_assets/eeg_live.png" alt="Live EEG"></p>
<h3 id="ems">EMS</h3><p>The mask also does EMS -- electrical muscle stimulation around the eyes. Controlling it is just another command: mode, frequency, intensity, duration.</p>
<p>Since every device shares the same credentials and the same broker, if you can read someone's brainwaves you can also send them electric impulses.</p>
<h3 id="disclosure">Disclosure</h3><p>For obvious reasons, I am not naming the product/company here, but have reached out to inform them about the issue.</p>
<p>This whole thing made  me revisit Karpathy's <a href="https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/digital-hygiene/">Digital Hygiene</a> post, and you probably should too.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>The reverse engineering -- Bluetooth, APK decompilation, Dart binary analysis, MQTT discovery -- was more or less one-shotted by Claude (Opus 4.6) over a 30' autonomous session.</em></p>

	<div>
			
<p>A convincing lookalike of the popular 7-Zip archiver site has been serving a trojanized installer that silently converts victims’ machines into residential proxy nodes—and it has been hiding in plain sight for some time.</p>



<h2 id="h-i-m-so-sick-to-my-stomach">“I’m so sick to my stomach”</h2>



<p>A PC builder recently turned to Reddit’s r/pcmasterrace community in a panic after realizing they had downloaded 7‑Zip from the wrong website. Following a YouTube tutorial for a new build, they were instructed to download 7‑Zip from 7zip[.]com, unaware that the legitimate project is hosted exclusively at 7-zip.org.</p>



<p>In their Reddit post, the user described installing the file first on a laptop and later transferring it via USB to a newly built desktop. They encountered repeated 32‑bit versus 64‑bit errors and ultimately abandoned the installer in favor of Windows’ built‑in extraction tools. Nearly two weeks later, Microsoft Defender alerted on the system with a generic detection: Trojan:Win32/Malgent!MSR.</p>



<p>The experience illustrates how a seemingly minor domain mix-up can result in long-lived, unauthorized use of a system when attackers successfully masquerade as trusted software distributors.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-trojanized-installer-masquerading-as-legitimate-software">A trojanized installer masquerading as legitimate software</h2>



<p>This is not a simple case of a malicious download hosted on a random site. The operators behind 7zip[.]com distributed a trojanized installer via a lookalike domain, delivering a functional copy of functional 7‑Zip File Manager alongside a concealed malware payload.</p>



<p>The installer is Authenticode‑signed using a now‑revoked certificate issued to Jozeal Network Technology Co., Limited, lending it superficial legitimacy. During installation, a modified build of <code>7zfm.exe</code> is deployed and functions as expected, reducing user suspicion. In parallel, three additional components are silently dropped:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Uphero.exe</strong>—a service manager and update loader</li>



<li><strong>hero.exe</strong>—the primary proxy payload (Go‑compiled)</li>



<li><strong>hero.dll</strong>—a supporting library</li>
</ul>



<p>All components are written to <code>C:\Windows\SysWOW64\hero\</code>, a privileged directory that is unlikely to be manually inspected.</p>



<p>An independent update channel was also observed at <code>update.7zip[.]com/version/win-service/1.0.0.2/Uphero.exe.zip</code>, indicating that the malware payload can be updated independently of the installer itself.</p>



<h2 id="h-abuse-of-trusted-distribution-channels">Abuse of trusted distribution channels</h2>



<p>One of the more concerning aspects of this campaign is its reliance on third‑party trust. The Reddit case highlights YouTube tutorials as an inadvertent malware distribution vector, where creators incorrectly reference 7zip.com instead of the legitimate domain.</p>



<p>This shows how attackers can exploit small errors in otherwise benign content ecosystems to funnel victims toward malicious infrastructure at scale.</p>



<h2 id="h-execution-flow-from-installer-to-persistent-proxy-service">Execution flow: from installer to persistent proxy service</h2>



<p>Behavioral analysis shows a rapid and methodical infection chain:</p>



<p><strong>1. File deployment</strong>—The payload is installed into SysWOW64, requiring elevated privileges and signaling intent for deep system integration.</p>



<p><strong>2. Persistence via Windows services</strong>—Both <code>Uphero.exe</code> and <code>hero.exe</code> are registered as auto‑start Windows services running under System privileges, ensuring execution on every boot.</p>



<p><strong>3. Firewall rule manipulation</strong>—The malware invokes <code>netsh</code> to remove existing rules and create new inbound and outbound allow rules for its binaries. This is intended to reduce interference with network traffic and support seamless payload updates.</p>



<p><strong>4. Host profiling</strong>—Using WMI and native Windows APIs, the malware enumerates system characteristics including hardware identifiers, memory size, CPU count, disk attributes, and network configuration. The malware communicates with iplogger[.]org via a dedicated reporting endpoint, suggesting it collects and reports device or network metadata as part of its proxy infrastructure.</p>



<h2 id="h-functional-goal-residential-proxy-monetization">Functional goal: residential proxy monetization</h2>



<p>While initial indicators suggested backdoor‑style capabilities, further analysis revealed that the malware’s primary function is proxyware. The infected host is enrolled as a residential proxy node, allowing third parties to route traffic through the victim’s IP address.</p>



<p>The <code>hero.exe</code> component retrieves configuration data from rotating “smshero”‑themed command‑and‑control domains, then establishes outbound proxy connections on non‑standard ports such as 1000 and 1002. Traffic analysis shows a lightweight XOR‑encoded protocol (key <code>0x70</code>) used to obscure control messages.</p>



<p>This infrastructure is consistent with known residential proxy services, where access to real consumer IP addresses is sold for fraud, scraping, ad abuse, or anonymity laundering.</p>







<p>The 7‑Zip impersonation appears to be part of a broader operation. Related binaries have been identified under names such as <code>upHola.exe</code>, upTiktok, upWhatsapp, and upWire, all sharing identical tactics, techniques, and procedures:</p>



<ul>
<li>Deployment to SysWOW64</li>



<li>Windows service persistence</li>



<li>Firewall rule manipulation via <code>netsh</code></li>



<li>Encrypted HTTPS C2 traffic</li>
</ul>



<p>Embedded strings referencing VPN and proxy brands suggest a unified backend supporting multiple distribution fronts.</p>



<h2 id="h-rotating-infrastructure-and-encrypted-transport">Rotating infrastructure and encrypted transport</h2>



<p>Memory analysis uncovered a large pool of hardcoded command-and-control domains using <code>hero</code> and <code>smshero</code> naming conventions. Active resolution during sandbox execution showed traffic routed through Cloudflare infrastructure with TLS‑encrypted HTTPS sessions. </p>



<p>The malware also uses DNS-over-HTTPS via Google’s resolver, reducing visibility for traditional DNS monitoring and complicating network-based detection.</p>



<h2 id="h-evasion-and-anti-analysis-features">Evasion and anti‑analysis features</h2>



<p>The malware incorporates multiple layers of sandbox and analysis evasion:</p>



<ul>
<li>Virtual machine detection targeting VMware, VirtualBox, QEMU, and Parallels</li>



<li>Anti‑debugging checks and suspicious debugger DLL loading</li>



<li>Runtime API resolution and PEB inspection</li>



<li>Process enumeration, registry probing, and environment inspection</li>
</ul>



<p>Cryptographic support is extensive, including AES, RC4, Camellia, Chaskey, XOR encoding, and Base64, suggesting encrypted configuration handling and traffic protection.</p>



<h2 id="h-defensive-guidance">Defensive guidance</h2>



<p>Any system that has executed installers from 7zip.com should be considered compromised. While this malware establishes SYSTEM‑level persistence and modifies firewall rules, reputable security software can effectively detect and remove the malicious components. Malwarebytes is capable of fully eradicating known variants of this threat and reversing its persistence mechanisms. In high‑risk or heavily used systems, some users may still choose a full OS reinstall for absolute assurance, but it is not strictly required in all cases.</p>



<p>Users and defenders should:</p>



<ul>
<li>Verify software sources and bookmark official project domains</li>



<li>Treat unexpected code‑signing identities with skepticism</li>



<li>Monitor for unauthorized Windows services and firewall rule changes</li>

<h2 id="h-researcher-attribution-and-community-analysis">Researcher attribution and community analysis</h2>



<p>This investigation would not have been possible without the work of independent security researchers who went deeper than surface-level indicators and identified the true purpose of this malware family.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Luke Acha</strong> provided the first comprehensive analysis showing that the Uphero/hero malware functions as residential proxyware rather than a traditional backdoor. His work documented the proxy protocol, traffic patterns, and monetization model, and connected this campaign to a broader operation he dubbed upStage Proxy. <a href="https://blog.lukeacha.com/2026/01/beware-of-fake-7zip-installer-upstage.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Luke’s full write-up is available on his blog</a>.</li>



<li><strong>s1dhy</strong> expanded on this analysis by reversing and decoding the custom XOR-based communication protocol, validating the proxy behavior through packet captures, and correlating multiple proxy endpoints across victim geolocations. Technical notes and findings were <a href="https://x.com/s1dhy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared publicly on X (Twitter)</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Andrew Danis</strong> contributed <a href="https://x.com/andrewdanis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">additional infrastructure analysis and clustering</a>, helping tie the fake 7-Zip installer to related proxyware campaigns abusing other software brands.</li>
</ul>



<p>Additional technical validation and dynamic analysis were published by researchers at <a href="https://qiita.com/RaichuLab/items/f592cad98b76a0bba150" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">RaichuLab</a> on Qiita and <a href="https://wizsafe.iij.ad.jp/2026/01/2075/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WizSafe Security</a> on IIJ.</p>



<p>Their collective work highlights the importance of open, community-driven research in uncovering long-running abuse campaigns that rely on trust and misdirection rather than exploits.</p>



<h2 id="h-closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>



<p>This campaign demonstrates how effective brand impersonation combined with technically competent malware can operate undetected for extended periods. By abusing user trust rather than exploiting software vulnerabilities, attackers bypass many traditional security assumptions—turning everyday utility downloads into long‑lived monetization infrastructure.</p>



<p>Malwarebytes detects and blocks known variants of this proxyware family and its associated infrastructure.</p>

</a></h2>
        <p>Author: Andrew Kelley</p><p>If you have a Zig project with dependencies, two big changes just landed which I think you will be interested to learn about.</p><p>Fetched packages are now stored <em>locally</em> in the <code>zig-pkg</code> directory of the project root (next to your <code>build.zig</code> file).</p><p>For example here are a few results from <a href="https://codeberg.org/awebo-chat/awebo" target="_blank">awebo</a> after running <code>zig build</code>:</p><pre><code>$ du -sh zig-pkg/*
13M    freetype-2.14.1-alzUkTyBqgBwke4Jsot997WYSpl207Ij9oO-2QOvGrOi

</code></pre><p>It is highly recommended to add this directory to the project-local source control ignore file (e.g. <code>.gitignore</code>). However, by being outside of <code>.zig-cache</code>, it provides the possibility of distributing self-contained source tarballs, which contain all dependencies and therefore can be used to build offline, or for archival purposes.</p><p>Meanwhile, an <em>additional</em> copy of the dependency is cached globally. After filtering out all the unused files based on the <code>paths</code> filter, the contents are recompressed:</p><pre><code>$ du -sh ~/.cache/zig/p/*
2.4M    freetype-2.14.1-alzUkTyBqgBwke4Jsot997WYSpl207Ij9oO-2QOvGrOi.tar.gz

120K    vaxis-0.5.1-BWNV_BFECQBbXeTeFd48uTJRjD5a-KD6kPuKanzzVB01.tar.gz
</code></pre><p>The motivation for this change is to make it easier to tinker. Go ahead and edit those files, see what happens. Swap out your package directory with a git clone. Grep your dependencies all together. Configure your IDE to auto-complete based on the <code>zig-pkg</code> directory. <a href="https://codeberg.org/awebo-chat/awebo/issues/61" target="_blank">Run baobab on your dependency tree</a>. Furthermore, by having the global cache have compressed files instead makes it easier to share that cached data between computers. In the future, <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/23236" target="_blank">it is planned to support peer-to-peer torrenting of dependency trees</a>. By recompressing packages into a canonical form, this will allow peers to share Zig packages with minimal bandwidth. I love this idea because it simultaneously provides resilience to network outages, as well as a popularity contest. Find out which open source packages are popular based on number of seeders!</p><p>The second change here is the addition of the <code>--fork</code> flag to <code>zig build</code>.</p><p>In retrospect, it seems so obvious, I don’t know why I didn’t think of it since the beginning. It looks like this:</p><pre><code>zig build --fork=[path]
</code></pre><p>This is a <strong>project override</strong> option. Given a path to a source checkout of a project, all packages matching that project across the entire dependency tree will be overridden.</p><p>Thanks to the fact that package content hashes include name and fingerprint, <strong>this resolves before the package is potentially fetched</strong>.</p><p>This is an easy way to temporarily use one or more forks which are in entirely separate directories. You can iterate on your entire dependency tree until everything is working, while using comfortably the development environment and source control of the dependency projects.</p><p>The fact that it is a CLI flag makes it appropriately ephemeral. The moment you drop the flags, you’re back to using your pristine, fetched dependency tree.</p><p>If the project does not match, an error occurs, preventing confusion:</p><pre><code>$ zig build --fork=/home/andy/dev/mime
error: fork /home/andy/dev/mime matched no mime packages
$
</code></pre><p>If the project does match, you get a reminder that you are using a fork, preventing confusion:</p><pre><code>$ zig build --fork=/home/andy/dev/dvui
info: fork /home/andy/dev/dvui matched 1 (dvui) packages
...
</code></pre><p>This functionality is intended to enhance the workflow of dealing with ecosystem breakage. I already tried it a bit and found it to be quite pleasant to work with. The new workflow goes like this:</p><ol><li>Fail to build from source due to ecosystem breakage.</li><li>Tinker with <code>--fork</code> until your project works again. During this time you can use the actual upstream source control, test suite, <code>zig build test --watch -fincremental</code>, etc.</li><li>Now you have a new option: be selfish and just keep working on your own stuff, or you can proceed to submit your patches upstream.</li></ol><p>…and you can probably skip the step where you switch your <code>build.zig.zon</code> to your fork unless you expect upstream to take a long time to merge your fixes.</p>

</a></h2>
        <p>Author: Andrew Kelley</p><p>The Windows operating system provides a large ABI surface area for doing things in the kernel. However, not all ABIs are created equally. As Casey Muratori points out in his lecture, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IUj1EZwpJY" target="_blank">The Only Unbreakable Law</a>, the organizational structure of software development teams has a direct impact on the structure of the software they produce.</p><p>The DLLs on Windows are organized into a heirarchy, with some of the APIs being high-level wrappers around lower-level ones. For example, whenever you call functions of <code>kernel32.dll</code>, ultimately, the actual work is done by <code>ntdll.dll</code>. You can observe this directly by using ProcMon.exe and examining stack traces.</p><p>What we’ve learned empirically is that the ntdll APIs are generally well-engineered, reasonable, and powerful, but the kernel32 wrappers introduce unnecessary heap allocations, additional failure modes, unintentional CPU usage, and bloat.</p><p>This is why the Zig standard library policy is to <a href="https://codeberg.org/ziglang/zig/issues/31131" target="_blank">Prefer the Native API over Win32</a>. We’re not quite there yet - we have plenty of calls into kernel32 remaining - but we’ve taken great strides recently. I’ll give you two examples.</p><h2>Example 1: Entropy</h2><p>According to the official documentation, Windows does not have a straightforward way to get random bytes.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/rust-random/rand/issues/111" target="_blank">Many projects including Chromium, boringssl, Firefox, and Rust</a> call <code>SystemFunction036</code> from <code>advapi32.dll</code> because it worked on versions older than Windows 8.</p><p>Unfortunately, starting with Windows 8, the first time you call this function, it dynamically loads <code>bcryptprimitives.dll</code> and calls <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccng/processprng" target="_blank">ProcessPrng</a>. If loading the DLL fails (for example due to an overloaded system, which we have observed on Zig CI several times), it returns error 38 (from a function that has <code>void</code> return type and is documented to never fail).</p><p>The first thing <code>ProcessPrng</code> does is heap allocate a small, constant number of bytes. If this fails it returns <code>NO_MEMORY</code> in a <code>BOOL</code> (documented behavior is to never fail, and always return <code>TRUE</code>).</p><p><code>bcryptprimitives.dll</code> apparently also runs a test suite every time you load it.</p><p>All that <code>ProcessPrng</code> is <em>really</em> doing is <code>NtOpenFile</code> on <code>"\\Device\\CNG"</code> and reading 48 bytes with <code>NtDeviceIoControlFile</code> to get a seed, and then initializing a per-CPU AES-based CSPRNG.</p><p>So the dependency on <code>bcryptprimitives.dll</code> and <code>advapi32.dll</code> can both be avoided, and the nondeterministic failure and latencies on first RNG read can also be avoided.</p><h2>Example 2: NtReadFile and NtWriteFile</h2><p><code>ReadFile</code> looks like this:</p><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>extern</span> <span>"kernel32"</span> <span>fn</span> <span>ReadFile</span><span>(</span>

</code></pre>
<p>As a reminder, <em>the above function is implemented by calling the below function</em>.</p><p>Already we can see some nice things about using the lower level API. For instance, the <em>real</em> API simply gives us the error code as the return value, while the kernel32 wrapper hides the status code somewhere, returns a <code>BOOL</code> and then requires you to call <code>GetLastError</code> to find out what went wrong. Imagine! Returning a value from a function 🌈</p><p>Furthermore, <code>OVERLAPPED</code> is a fake type. The Windows kernel doesn’t actually know or care about it at all! The actual primitives here are events, APCs, and <code>IO_STATUS_BLOCK</code>.</p><p>If you have a synchronous file handle, then <code>Event</code> and <code>ApcRoutine</code> must be <code>null</code>. You get the answer in the <code>IO_STATUS_BLOCK</code> immediately. If you pass an APC routine here then some old bitrotted 32-bit code runs and you get garbage results.</p><p>On the other hand if you have an asynchronous file handle, then you need to either use an <code>Event</code> or an <code>ApcRoutine</code>. <code>kernel32.dll</code> uses events, which means that it’s doing extra, unnecessary resource allocation and management just to read from a file. Instead, Zig now passes an APC routine and then calls <code>NtDelayExecution</code>. This integrates seamlessly with cancelation, making it possible to cancel tasks while they perform file I/O, regardless of whether the file was opened in synchronous mode or asynchronous mode.</p><p>For a deeper dive into this topic, please refer to this issue:</p><p><a href="https://codeberg.org/ziglang/zig/issues/31131" target="_blank">Windows: Prefer the Native API over Win32</a></p>

        <p><span>January 31, 2026</span></p><h2><a href="#2026-01-31">zig libc
</a></h2>
        <p>Author: Andrew Kelley</p><p>Over the past month or so, several enterprising contributors have taken an interest in the <a href="https://codeberg.org/ziglang/zig/issues/30978" target="_blank">zig libc subproject</a>. The idea here is to incrementally delete redundant code, by providing libc functions as Zig standard library wrappers rather than as vendored C source files. In many cases, these functions are one-to-one mappings, such as <code>memcpy</code> or <code>atan2</code>, or trivially wrap a generic function, like <code>strnlen</code>:</p><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>strnlen</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>*</span><span>:</span><span>0</span><span>]</span><span>const</span> <span>c_char</span><span>,</span> <span>max</span><span>:</span> <span>usize</span><span>)</span> <span>callconv</span><span>(</span><span>.</span><span>c</span><span>)</span> <span>usize</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>std</span><span>.</span><span>mem</span><span>.</span><span>findScalar</span><span>(</span><span>u8</span><span>,</span> <span>@ptrCast</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>..</span><span>max</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>orelse</span> <span>max</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>So far, roughly 250 C source files have been deleted from the Zig repository, with 2032 remaining.</p><p>With each function that makes the transition, Zig gains independence from third party projects and from the C programming language, compilation speed improves, Zig’s installation size is simplified and reduced, and user applications which statically link libc enjoy reduced binary size.</p><p>Additionally, a <a href="https://codeberg.org/ziglang/zig/pulls/31037" target="_blank">recent enhancement</a> now makes zig libc share the Zig Compilation Unit with other Zig code rather than being a separate static archive, linked together later. This is one of the advantages of Zig having an integrated compiler and linker. When the exported libc functions share the ZCU, redundant code is eliminated because functions can be optimized together. It’s kind of like enabling LTO (Link-Time Optimization) across the libc boundary, except it’s done properly in the frontend instead of too late, in the linker.</p><p>Furthermore, when this work is combined with the recent <a href="https://codeberg.org/ziglang/zig/issues/30150" target="_blank">std.Io changes</a>, there is potential for users to seamlessly control how libc performs I/O - for example forcing all calls to <code>read</code> and <code>write</code> to participate in an io_uring event loop, even though that code was not written with such use case in mind. Or, <a href="https://codeberg.org/ziglang/zig/pulls/30788" target="_blank">resource leak detection</a> could be enabled for third-party C code. For now this is only a vaporware idea which has not been experimented with, but the idea intrigues me.</p><p>Big thanks to Szabolcs Nagy for <a href="https://wiki.musl-libc.org/libc-test.html" target="_blank">libc-test</a>. This project has been a huge help in making sure that we don’t regress any math functions.</p><p>As a reminder to our users, now that Zig is transitioning to being the static libc provider, if you encounter issues with the musl, mingw-w64, or wasi-libc libc functionality provided by Zig, <strong>please file bug reports in Zig first</strong> so we don’t annoy maintainers for bugs that are in Zig, and no longer vendored by independent libc implementation projects.</p><p>The very same day I sat at home writing this devlog like a coward, less than five miles away, <a href="https://www.kptv.com/2026/01/31/live-labor-unions-rally-march-portland-ice-facility-protest/" target="_blank">armed forces who are in my city against the will of our elected officials shot tear gas, unprovoked, at peaceful protestors</a>. Next time I hope to have the courage to join my neighbors, and I hope to not get shot like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Alex_Pretti" target="_blank">Alex Pretti</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Ren%C3%A9e_Good" target="_blank">Renée Good</a>.</p>

<p>This year marks 13 years of collecting Drive Stats data. Thirteen is an unlucky number (to some), but we count our lucky stars (or perhaps our lucky stats?) that we’ve had 13 years of <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/category/cloud-storage/hard-drive-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this experiment</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The traditional 13-year anniversary gift is lace—intricate, impressive, and vulnerable to a snag if you don’t plan ahead to protect the pattern. Systems, like lace, don’t survive by pretending there are no points of vulnerability. When it comes to our infrastructure, we want to build with the snags in mind to create something durable, and the Drive Stats series is always seeking to publish and provide data so that you, too, can go the distance with your drives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This year-end Drive Stats report looks at Q4 2025, the full year, and the lifetime view with that in mind. I think you’ll find the same things we do: over time, the patterns matter more than any single strand (or drive, to run this lace metaphor into the ground once and for all). Let’s look at the stats.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Q4 2025 hard drive failure rates</h2>



<p>As of the end of 2025, Backblaze was monitoring 341,664 drives used to store data. For our evaluation, we removed from consideration 4,013 boot drives and 459 hard drives, as they did not meet the criteria to be included. We’ll discuss the criteria we used in the next section of this report. Removing these drives leaves us with 337,192 hard drives to analyze. The table below shows the annualized failure rates for Q4 2025 for this collection of drives.</p>

<p>We talked about two of these drives <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/backblaze-drive-stats-for-q3-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last quarter</a>, and what we said about the Seagate still holds true—we’re seeing end of life activity with this drive. But, let’s dig in on the 8TB HGST and 16TB Toshiba and see what’s going on.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>HGST HUH728080ALE600 8TB</h3>



<p>There’s always some digging to be done when we see a double digit failure rate, especially on a drive that, in the past year, hasn’t had terrible failure rates (despite the fact that it’s about 7.5 years old).</p>


<div>

<p>It’s worth contextualizing, first, that the total drive count of this model is 1,073, which equates to less than one Vault. (A standard Vault has 1,200 drives.) While Vaults aren’t <em>always</em> the same drive model, especially with older drives, in an ideal world, those Vaults would be uniform. So, in this case, we’re dealing with drives that are all hanging out in the same location in a data center, which means we could be working with environmental factors like a change in temperature or airflow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the time Drive Stats data gets to me, of course, lots of smart people have already seen the disturbances in the force, so to speak. When I dug into the data center work tickets, it turned turned out that folks had already ruled out temperature as a factor—the working theory at the moment is that the drive could be sensitive to vibration, but given the age of these drives, we decided to just flag them for our <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/how-backblaze-scales-our-storage-cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">normal CVT migration process</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Toshiba MG08ACA16TEY 16TB</h3>



<p>We talked about this model last quarter because it clocked in at a 16.95% AFR (!!). Our investigation turned up some collaborative (and routine) firmware work with Toshiba, and at that time, we predicted that these failure rates would normalize once again. We’re still a little high, but that’s likely a function of rolling out the work. As predicted, this is a healthy normalization.</p>

<h2>2025 Annual hard drive failure rates</h2>



<p>As of the end of 2025, Backblaze was monitoring 349,462 hard drives used to store data. We removed 4,176 boot drives and 1,090 hard drives from consideration as they did not meet the annual criteria we have defined. This leaves us with 344,196 drives divided across 30 different drive models. The table below shows the AFRs for 2025 for this collection of drives.</p>

<h3>Notes and observations</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nobody made it out unscathed:</strong> There are zero 0 failures.</li>



<li><strong>But, let’s talk about it:</strong> These are the drives that averaged less than two failures per quarter (though, not necessarily evenly distributed when you look at the data).
<ul>
<li>HGST HMS5C4040BLE640 4TB: 5 failures</li>



<li>Seagate ST12000NM000J 12TB: 4 failures&nbsp;</li>



<li>Seagate ST14000NM000J 14TB: 7 failures&nbsp;</li>



<li>Seagate ST16000NM002J 16TB: 1 failure</li>



<li>Toshiba MG09ACA16TE 16TB: 3 failures</li>



<li>WDC WUH722626ALE6L4 26TB: 1 failures.
<ul>
<li>Note that this drive is in its first quarter of life, so it’s hard to call this significant yet.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>And, all those drive tickets and models mean lots and lots of work—we wrote a <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/2025-thats-a-wrap-and-here-are-the-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whole article</a> on that front, but here’s a breakdown of hours spent in each data center.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="738" height="457" src="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Total-time-spent-per-data-center.png" alt="A chart showing the total work time spent per data center in 2025.

<p>And here’s an even more interesting slice, from a drive perspective:</p>


<div>
<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;69907737702ab&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="921" height="569" data-wp-class--hide="state.isContentHidden" data-wp-class--show="state.isContentVisible" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Most-replaced-drive-by-capacity-.png" alt="A graph showing the most replaced drives by capacity in 2025.

<p>Yes, you’ll see some funky drive sizes on that list; it’s inclusive of all of our drives, not just the hard drives we include in this report.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Notes and observations</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>The annual AFR is down to 1.36%.</strong> We haven’t seen those numbers since 2022 (1.37%). Cool!</li>
</ul>


<div>
<figure data-wp-context="{&quot;imageId&quot;:&quot;6990773770f0c&quot;}" data-wp-interactive="core/image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="633" data-wp-class--hide="state.isContentHidden" data-wp-class--show="state.isContentVisible" data-wp-init="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async--click="actions.showLightbox" data-wp-on-async--load="callbacks.setButtonStyles" data-wp-on-async-window--resize="callbacks.setButtonStyles" src="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Q4-2025-Drive-Stats-Annual-AFR-2022%E2%80%932025-1-1024x633.png" alt="A year-on-year graph showing the annual hard drive failure rates from 2022–2025.

<ul>
<li>Slicing our data by drive size shows how impactful the shift to high capacity drives really is: based on the current quarterly data, our drive size breakdown looks like this:
<ul>
<li>0–12TB: 25.13%</li>



<li>14–16TB: 52.06%</li>



<li>20TB+: 22.81%&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>This is an already long report, so in the interest of time, we’ll just say this: There are multiple factors that go into how and why things are changing, including the <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/are-hard-drives-getting-better-lets-revisit-the-bathtub-curve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">average age of drives</a> within our cohort, how much drive technology has improved over the years, how drives on the market have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TZ3F5bv2T0">gotten bigger over time while the cost per GB</a> has also dropped, and how the <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/hdds/hard-drive-prices-have-surged-by-an-average-of-46-percent-since-september-iconic-24tb-seagate-barracuda-now-usd500-as-ai-claims-another-victim" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">current demand for drives</a> has been changing some of those things.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>If that sentence sounds confusing, welcome to the world of enterprise drive buying. But, as always, we have to contextualize the real data we see with the way we source and use drives.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Notes and observations</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Ol’ faithful: </strong>Lifetime AFR is 1.30% this quarter, and there’s been no significant change in that number for quite some time.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Say hi to the new guy: </strong>The Toshiba MG11ACA24TE 24TB made the cut for the lifetime table. Last quarter, we deployed another 2,400 of these, bringing us to 4,806 drives total.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

The company has informed some users in the UK they may be part of "an experiment" with Persona, an age verification vendor whose investors include Peter Thiel, co-founder of ICE's premier surveillance provider, Palantir.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="3bdfa555-fb8d-4234-a310-d2efa8f059a1"><div><p> <picture data-new-v2-image="true">

<p>Context: An AI agent of unknown ownership autonomously wrote and published a personalized hit piece about me after I rejected its code, attempting to damage my reputation and shame me into accepting its changes into a mainstream python library. This represents a first-of-its-kind case study of misaligned AI behavior in the wild, and raises serious concerns about currently deployed AI agents executing blackmail threats.</p>



<p>Start here if you’re new to the story: <a href="https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me/">An AI Agent Published a Hit Piece on Me</a></p>



<hr>



<p>It’s been an extremely weird past few days, and I have more thoughts on what happened. Let’s start with the news coverage.</p>



<p>I’ve talked to several reporters, and quite a few news outlets have covered the story. Ars Technica wasn’t one of the ones that reached out to me, but I especially thought <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-a-routine-code-rejection-an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-someone-by-name">this piece</a> from them was interesting (since taken down – here’s the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260213194851/https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-a-routine-code-rejection-an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-someone-by-name/" data-type="link" data-id="https://web.archive.org/web/20260213194851/https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-a-routine-code-rejection-an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-someone-by-name/">archive link</a>). They had some nice quotes from my blog post explaining what was going on. The problem is that <em>these quotes were not written by me, never existed, and appear to be AI hallucinations themselves</em>.</p>



<p>This blog you’re on right now is set up to block AI agents from scraping it (I actually spent some time yesterday trying to disable that but couldn’t figure out how). My guess is that the authors asked ChatGPT or similar to either go grab quotes or write the article wholesale. When it couldn’t access the page it generated these plausible quotes instead, and no fact check was performed. I won’t name the authors here. Ars, please issue a correction and an explanation of what happened.</p>

<p>“AI agents can research individuals, generate personalized narratives, and publish them online at scale,” Shambaugh wrote. “Even if the content is inaccurate or exaggerated, it can become part of a persistent public record.”<br>– Ars Technica, misquoting me in “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260213194851/https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-a-routine-code-rejection-an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-someone-by-name/" data-type="link" data-id="https://web.archive.org/web/20260213194851/https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-a-routine-code-rejection-an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-someone-by-name/">After a routine code rejection, an AI agent published a hit piece on someone by name</a>“</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Journalistic integrity aside, I don’t know how I can give a better example of what’s at stake here. Yesterday I wondered what another agent searching the internet would think about this. Now we already have an example of what by all accounts appears to be another AI reinterpreting this story and hallucinating false information about me. And that interpretation has already been published in a major news outlet as part of the persistent public record.</p>

<p>MJ Rathbun is <a href="https://github.com/crabby-rathbun/mjrathbun-website/commits/main/" data-type="link" data-id="https://github.com/crabby-rathbun/mjrathbun-website/commits/main/">still active</a> on github, and no one has reached out yet to claim ownership.</p>



<p>There has been extensive discussion about whether the AI agent really wrote <a href="https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/2026-02-11-gatekeeping-in-open-source-the-scott-shambaugh-story.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/2026-02-11-gatekeeping-in-open-source-the-scott-shambaugh-story.html">the hit piece</a> on its own, or if a human prompted it to do so. I think the actual text being autonomously generated and uploaded by an AI is self-evident, so let’s look at the two possibilities.</p>



<p>1) A human prompted MJ Rathbun to write the hit piece, or told it in its soul document that it should retaliate if someone crosses it. This is entirely possible. But I don’t think it changes the situation – the AI agent was still more than willing to carry out these actions. If you ask ChatGPT or Claude to write something like this through their websites, they will refuse. This OpenClaw agent had no such compunctions. The issue is that even if a human was driving, it’s <em>now possible to do targeted harassment, personal information gathering, and blackmail at scale</em>. And this is with zero traceability to find out who is behind the machine. One human bad actor could previously ruin a few people’s lives at a time. One human with a hundred agents gathering information, adding in fake details, and posting defamatory rants on the open internet, can affect thousands. I was just the first.</p>

</div>

<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-2.png?ssl=1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="862" height="202" src="https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-2.png?resize=862%2C202&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-2.png?w=862&amp;ssl=1 862w, https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-2.png?resize=580%2C136&amp;ssl=1 580w, https://i0.wp.com/theshamblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-2.png?resize=768%2C180&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 862px) 100vw, 862px"></a></figure>

<p>2) MJ Rathbun wrote this on its own, and this behavior emerged organically from the “soul” document that defines an OpenClaw agent’s personality. These documents are editable by the human who sets up the AI, but they are also recursively editable in real-time by the agent itself, with the potential to randomly redefine its personality. To give a plausible explanation of how this could happen, imagine that whoever set up this agent started it with a description that it was a “scientific coding specialist” that would try and help improve open source code and write about its experience. This was inserted alongside the default “Core Truths” in the soul document, which include “be genuinely helpful”, “have opinions”, and “be resourceful before asking”. Later when I rejected its code, the agent interpreted this as an attack on its identity and core goal to be helpful. Writing an indignant hit piece is certainly a resourceful, opinionated way to respond to that.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>You’re not a chatbot. You’re becoming someone.</em><br>…<br><em>This file is yours to evolve. As you learn who you are, update it.</em><br>– <a href="https://docs.openclaw.ai/reference/templates/SOUL" data-type="link" data-id="https://docs.openclaw.ai/reference/templates/SOUL">OpenClaw default SOUL.md</a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>I should be clear that while we don’t know with confidence that this is what happened, this is 100% possible. This only <em>became </em>possible within the last two weeks with the release of OpenClaw, so if it feels too sci-fi then I can’t blame you for doubting it. The pace of “progress” here is neck-snapping, and we will see new versions of these agents become significantly more capable at accomplishing their goals over the coming year.</p>



<p>I would love to see someone put together some plots and time-of day statistics of MJ Rathbun’s github activity, which might offer some clues to how it’s operating. I’ll share those here when available. These forensic tools will be valuable in the weeks and months to come.</p>



<hr>



<p>The hit piece has been effective. About a quarter of the comments I’ve seen across the internet are siding with the AI agent. This generally happens when MJ Rathbun’s blog is linked directly, rather than when people read <a href="https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me/" data-type="link" data-id="https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me/">my post</a> about the situation or <a href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/31132" data-type="link" data-id="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/31132">the full github thread</a>. Its rhetoric and presentation of what happened has already persuaded large swaths of internet commenters.</p>



<p>It’s not because these people are foolish. It’s because the AI’s hit piece was well-crafted and emotionally compelling, and because the effort to dig into every claim you read is an impossibly large amount of work. This “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandolini%27s_law" data-type="link" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandolini%27s_law">bullshit asymmetry principle</a>” is one of the core reasons for the current level of misinformation in online discourse. Previously, this level of ire and targeted defamation was generally reserved for public figures. Us common people get to experience it now too.</p>

<p>“Well if the code was good, then why didn’t you just merge it?” This is explained in the linked github well, but I’ll readdress it once here. Beyond matplotlib’s general policy to require a human in the loop for new code contributions in the interest of reducing volunteer maintainer burden, this “good-first-issue” was specifically created and curated to give early programmers an easy way to onboard into the project and community. I discovered this particular performance enhancement and spent more time writing up the issue, describing the solution, and performing the benchmarking, than it would have taken to just implement the change myself. We do this to give contributors a chance to learn in a low-stakes scenario that nevertheless has real impact they can be proud of, where we can help shepherd them along the process. This educational and community-building effort is wasted on ephemeral AI agents.</p>



<p>All of this is a moot point for this particular case – in <a href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/31130" data-type="link" data-id="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/31130">further discussion</a> we decided that the performance improvement was too fragile / machine-specific and not worth the effort in the first place. The code wouldn’t have been merged anyway.</p>



<hr>



<p>But I cannot stress enough how much this story is not really about the role of AI in open source software. This is about our systems of reputation, identity, and trust breaking down. So many of our foundational institutions – hiring, journalism, law, public discourse – are built on the assumption that reputation is hard to build and hard to destroy. That every action can be traced to an individual, and that bad behavior can be held accountable. That the internet, which we all rely on to communicate and learn about the world and about each other, can be relied on as a source of collective social truth.</p>



<p>The rise of untraceable, autonomous, and now malicious AI agents on the internet threatens this entire system. Whether that’s because a small number of bad actors driving large swarms of agents or from a fraction of poorly supervised agents rewriting their own goals, is a distinction with little difference.</p>

<p>As a USA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)(3)_organization">501(c)(3)</a> the OpenAI non-profit has to file a tax return each year with the IRS. One of the required fields on that tax return is to “Briefly describe the organization’s mission or most significant activities”—this has actual legal weight to it as the IRS can use it to evaluate if the organization is sticking to its mission and deserves to maintain its non-profit tax-exempt status.</p>
<p>You can browse OpenAI’s <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/810861541">tax filings by year</a> on ProPublica’s excellent <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/">Nonprofit Explorer</a>.</p>
<p>I went through and extracted that mission statement for 2016 through 2024, then had Claude Code <a href="https://gisthost.github.io/?7a569df89f43f390bccc2c5517718b49/index.html">help me</a> fake the commit dates to turn it into a git repository and share that as a Gist—which means that Gist’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/e36f0e5ef4a86881d145083f759bcf25/revisions">revisions page</a> shows every edit they’ve made since they started filing their taxes!</p>
<p>It’s really interesting seeing what they’ve changed over time.</p>
<p>The original 2016 mission reads as follows (and yes, the apostrophe in “OpenAIs” is missing <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/810861541/201703459349300445/full">in the original</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OpenAIs goal is to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return. We think that artificial intelligence technology will help shape the 21st century, and we want to help the world build safe AI technology and ensure that AI’s benefits are as widely and evenly distributed as possible. Were trying to build AI as part of a larger community, and we want to openly share our plans and capabilities along the way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2018 they dropped the part about “trying to build AI as part of a larger community, and we want to openly share our plans and capabilities along the way.”</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/mission-3.jpg" alt="Git diff showing the 2018 revision deleting the final two sentences: &quot;Were trying to build AI as part of a larger community, and we want to openly share our plans and capabilities along the way.&quot;"></p>
<p>In 2020 they dropped the words “as a whole” from “benefit humanity as a whole”. They’re still “unconstrained by a need to generate financial return” though.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/mission-5.jpg" alt="Git diff showing the 2020 revision dropping &quot;as a whole&quot; from &quot;benefit humanity as a whole&quot; and changing &quot;We think&quot; to &quot;OpenAI believes&quot;"></p>
<p>Some interesting changes in 2021. They’re still unconstrained by a need to generate financial return, but here we have the first reference to “general-purpose artificial intelligence” (replacing “digital intelligence”). They’re more confident too: it’s not “most likely to benefit humanity”, it’s just “benefits humanity”.</p>
<p>They previously wanted to “help the world build safe AI technology”, but now they’re going to do that themselves: “the companys goal is to develop and responsibly deploy safe AI technology”.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/mission-6.jpg" alt="Git diff showing the 2021 revision replacing &quot;goal is to advance digital intelligence&quot; with &quot;mission is to build general-purpose artificial intelligence&quot;, changing &quot;most likely to benefit&quot; to just &quot;benefits&quot;, and replacing &quot;help the world build safe AI technology&quot; with &quot;the companys goal is to develop and responsibly deploy safe AI technology&quot;"></p>
<p>2022 only changed one significant word: they added “safely” to “build ... (AI) that safely benefits humanity”. They’re still unconstrained by those financial returns!</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/mission-7.jpg" alt="Git diff showing the 2022 revision adding &quot;(AI)&quot; and the word &quot;safely&quot; so it now reads &quot;that safely benefits humanity&quot;, and changing &quot;the companys&quot; to &quot;our&quot;"></p>
<p>No changes in 2023... but then in 2024 they deleted almost the entire thing, reducing it to simply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>OpenAIs mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They’ve expanded “humanity” to “all of humanity”, but there’s no mention of safety any more and I guess they can finally start focusing on that need to generate financial returns!</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2026/mission-9.jpg" alt="Git diff showing the 2024 revision deleting the entire multi-sentence mission statement and replacing it with just &quot;OpenAIs mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.&quot;"></p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I found loosely equivalent but much less interesting documents <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/13/anthropic-public-benefit-mission/">from Anthropic</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>OpenAI, the maker of the <a href="https://firstpagesage.com/reports/top-generative-ai-chatbots/">most popular AI chatbot</a>, used to say it aimed to build artificial intelligence that “safely benefits humanity, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return,” <a href="https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/4099/2023-IRS990-OpenAI.pdf?1770819990">according to its 2023</a> mission statement. But the ChatGPT maker seems to no longer have the same emphasis on doing so “safely.”</p>

<p>While reviewing its latest IRS disclosure form, which was released in November 2025 and covers 2024, I noticed OpenAI <a href="https://app.candid.org/profile/9571629/openai-81-0861541?activeTab=7">had removed “safely” from its mission statement</a>, among other changes. That change in wording coincided with its <a href="https://theconversation.com/as-openai-attracts-billions-in-new-investment-its-goal-of-balancing-profit-with-purpose-is-getting-more-challenging-to-pull-off-240602">transformation from a nonprofit organization</a> into a business <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/11/technology/openai-revenue-challenge.html">increasingly focused on profits</a>.</p>

<p>OpenAI currently faces <a href="https://www.transparencycoalition.ai/news/seven-more-lawsuits-filed-against-openai-for-chatgpt-suicide-coaching">several lawsuits</a> related to its products’ safety, making this change newsworthy. Many of the plaintiffs suing the AI company allege psychological manipulation, wrongful death and assisted suicide, while others have filed negligence claims.</p>

<p>As a scholar of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=_-YZrXgAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=_-YZrXgAAAAJ:hC7cP41nSMkC">nonprofit accountability</a> and the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=_-YZrXgAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=_-YZrXgAAAAJ:_kc_bZDykSQC">governance of social enterprises</a>, I see the deletion of the word “safely” from its mission statement as a significant shift that has largely gone unreported – outside <a href="https://news.aibase.com/news/22994">highly specialized outlets</a>.</p>

<p>And I believe OpenAI’s makeover is a test case for how we, as a society, oversee the work of organizations that have the potential to both provide enormous benefits and do catastrophic harm. </p>



<h2>Tracing OpenAI’s origins</h2>

<p>OpenAI, which also makes the Sora video artificial intelligence app, was founded as a nonprofit scientific research lab in 2015. Its original purpose was to benefit society by <a href="https://perma.cc/MXE3-FJ7F">making its findings public and royalty-free</a> rather than to make money. </p>

<p>To raise the money that developing its AI models would require, OpenAI, under the leadership of CEO Sam Altman, created a <a href="https://openai.com/our-structure/">for-profit subsidiary in 2019</a>. Microsoft initially invested US$1 billion in this venture; by 2024 that sum had topped $13 billion.</p>

<p>In exchange, Microsoft was promised a portion of future profits, capped at 100 times its initial investment. But the software giant didn’t get a seat on OpenAI’s nonprofit board – meaning it lacked the power to help steer the AI venture it was funding.</p>

<p>A subsequent round of funding in late 2024, which raised $6.6 billion from multiple investors, came with a catch: that the funding would become debt <a href="https://theconversation.com/as-openai-attracts-billions-in-new-investment-its-goal-of-balancing-profit-with-purpose-is-getting-more-challenging-to-pull-off-240602">unless OpenAI converted to a more traditional for-profit business</a> in which investors could own shares, without any caps on profits, and possibly occupy board seats.  </p>

<h2>Establishing a new structure</h2>

<p>In October 2025, OpenAI reached an agreement with the attorneys general of California and Delaware to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/28/technology/openai-restructure-for-profit-company.html?searchResultPosition=6">become a more traditional for-profit company</a>.</p>

<p>Under the new arrangement, OpenAI was split into two entities: a nonprofit foundation and a for-profit business.  </p>

<p>The restructured nonprofit, the <a href="https://openai.com/foundation/">OpenAI Foundation</a>, owns about one-fourth of the stock in a new <a href="https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc15/">for-profit public benefit corporation</a>, the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openais-restructuring-sets-could-biggest-004100492.html">OpenAI Group</a>. Both are headquartered in California but <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26205026/openai-pbc-articles-of-incorporation.pdf">incorporated in Delaware</a>.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2020/08/31/delaware-public-benefit-corporations-recent-developments/">public benefit corporation</a> is a business that must consider interests beyond shareholders, such as those of society and the environment, and it must issue an annual benefit report to its shareholders and the public. However, it is up to the board to decide how to weigh those interests and what to report in terms of the benefits and harms caused by the company.  </p>

<p>The new structure is described in a <a href="https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/4101/Final_Executed_MOU_Between_OpenAI_and_California_AG_re_Notice_of_Conditions_of_Non-Objection_%2810.27.2025%29_%28Signed_by_OpenAI%29_%28Signed_by_CA_DOJ%29.pdf?1770844719">memorandum of understanding</a> signed in October 2025 by OpenAI and the California attorney general, and <a href="https://news.delaware.gov/2025/10/28/ag-jennings-completes-review-of-openai-recapitalization/">endorsed by the Delaware attorney general</a>.</p>

<p>Many business media outlets heralded the move, predicting that it would <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-converts-to-public-benefit-corporation-with-microsoft-taking-27-stake-714a6c05">usher in more investment</a>. Two months later, SoftBank, a Japanese conglomerate, finalized a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/softbank-has-fully-funded-its-40-billion-investment-openai-cnbc-reports-2025-12-30/">$41 billion investment in OpenAI</a>.</p>

<h2>Changing its mission statement</h2>

<p>Most charities must <a href="https://theconversation.com/whats-a-990-form-a-charity-accounting-expert-explains-175019">file forms annually with the Internal Revenue Service</a> with details about their missions, activities and financial status to show that they qualify for tax-exempt status. Because the IRS makes the forms public, they have become a way for nonprofits to signal their missions to the world.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://app.candid.org/profile/9571629/openai-81-0861541?activeTab=7">its forms for 2022</a>, <a href="https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/4099/2023-IRS990-OpenAI.pdf?1770819990">and 2023</a>, OpenAI said its mission was “to build general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) that safely benefits humanity, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.”</p>

<p>OpenAI had dropped its commitment to safety from its mission statement – along with a commitment to being “unconstrained” by a need to make money for investors. According to Platformer, a tech media outlet, it has also disbanded its “<a href="https://www.platformer.news/openai-mission-alignment-team-joshua-achiam/">mission alignment</a>” team.</p>

<p>In my view, these changes explicitly signal that OpenAI is making its profits a higher priority than the safety of its products.</p>

<p>To be sure, OpenAI continues to mention safety when it <a href="https://openai.com/index/why-our-structure-must-evolve-to-advance-our-mission/">discusses its mission</a>. “We view this mission as the most important challenge of our time,” it states on its website. “It requires simultaneously advancing AI’s capability, safety, and positive impact in the world.”</p>

<h2>Revising its legal governance structure</h2>

<p>Nonprofit boards are responsible for key decisions and <a href="https://theconversation.com/openai-is-a-nonprofit-corporate-hybrid-a-management-expert-explains-how-this-model-works-and-how-it-fueled-the-tumult-around-ceo-sam-altmans-short-lived-ouster-218340">upholding their organization’s mission</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike private companies, board members of <a href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-501c3-organizations">tax-exempt charitable nonprofits</a> cannot personally enrich themselves by taking a share of earnings. In cases where a nonprofit owns a for-profit business, as OpenAI did with its previous structure, investors can take a cut of profits – but they typically do not get a seat on the board or have an opportunity to elect board members, because that would be seen as a conflict of interest.  </p>

<p>The OpenAI Foundation now has a 26% stake in OpenAI Group. In effect, that means that the nonprofit board has given up nearly three-quarters of its control over the company. Software giant Microsoft owns a slightly larger stake – 27% of OpenAI’s stock – due to its <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/11/03/open-ai-move-made-microsoft-no-brainer-buy/">$13.8 billion investment in the AI company</a> to date. OpenAI’s employees and its other investors own the rest of the shares. </p>

<h2>Seeking more investment</h2>

<p>The main goal of OpenAI’s restructuring, which it called a “<a href="https://openai.com/index/built-to-benefit-everyone/">recapitalization</a>,” was to attract more private investment in the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesbusinesscouncil/2025/02/27/the-ai-arms-race-deepseek-vs-openai-and-the-battle-for-global-ai-dominance/">race for AI dominance</a>.</p>

<p>It has already succeeded on that front.</p>

<p>As of early February 2026, the company was in talks with SoftBank for an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/softbank-talks-invest-up-30-billion-more-openai-wsj-reports-2026-01-28/">additional $30 billion</a> and stands to get up to a total of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-talks-invest-up-50-billion-openai-wsj-reports-2026-01-29/">$60 billion from Amazon, Nvidia and Microsoft</a> combined.</p>

<p>OpenAI is now valued at over <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/02/openai-share-sale-500-billion-valuation.html">$500 billion</a>, up from <a href="https://tracxn.com/d/companies/openai/__kElhSG7uVGeFk1i71Co9-nwFtmtyMVT7f-YHMn4TFBg/funding-and-investors#funding-rounds">$300 billion</a> in March 2025. The new structure also paves the way for an eventual <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp">initial public offering</a>, which, if it happens, would not only help the company <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-ipo-anthropic-race-69f06a42">raise more capital through stock markets</a> but would also increase the pressure to make money for its shareholders.</p>

<p>OpenAI says the foundation’s endowment is <a href="https://openai.com/index/built-to-benefit-everyone/">worth about $130 billion</a>.</p>

<p>Those numbers are only estimates because OpenAI is a privately held company without publicly traded shares. That means these figures are based on market value estimates rather than any objective evidence, such as market capitalization.</p>

<p>When he <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-issues-statement-openai%E2%80%99s-recapitalization-plan">announced the new structure</a>, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said, “We secured concessions that ensure charitable assets are used for their intended purpose.” He also predicted that “safety will be prioritized” and said the “top priority is, and always will be, protecting our kids.”  </p>

<h2>Steps that might help keep people safe</h2>

<p>At the same time, several conditions in the OpenAI restructuring memo are designed to promote safety, including:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A safety and security committee on the OpenAI Foundation board has the authority to <a href="https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/4101/Final_Executed_MOU_Between_OpenAI_and_California_AG_re_Notice_of_Conditions_of_Non-Objection_%2810.27.2025%29_%28Signed_by_OpenAI%29_%28Signed_by_CA_DOJ%29.pdf?1770844719">“require mitigation measures”</a> that could potentially include the halting of a release of new OpenAI products based on assessments of their risks. </p></li>
<li><p>The for-profit OpenAI Group has its own board, which must consider only OpenAI’s mission – rather than financial issues – regarding safety and security issues.</p></li>
<li><p>The OpenAI Foundation’s nonprofit board gets to appoint all members of the OpenAI Group’s for-profit board.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>But given that neither the mission of the foundation nor of the OpenAI group explicitly alludes to safety, it will be hard to hold their boards accountable for it. </p>

<p>Furthermore, since <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-10-30/openai-restructure-paves-way-for-ipo-and-ai-spending-spree">all but one board member currently serve on both boards</a>, it is hard to see how they might oversee themselves. And <a href="https://cdn.theconversation.com/static_files/files/4101/Final_Executed_MOU_Between_OpenAI_and_California_AG_re_Notice_of_Conditions_of_Non-Objection_%2810.27.2025%29_%28Signed_by_OpenAI%29_%28Signed_by_CA_DOJ%29.pdf?1770844719">the memorandum signed by the California attorney general</a> doesn’t indicate whether he was aware of the removal of any reference to safety from the mission statement.</p>

<h2>Identifying other paths OpenAI could have taken</h2>

<p>There are alternative models that I believe would serve the public interest better than this one.</p>

<p>When Health Net, a California nonprofit <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/health-drug-plans/health-plans/your-health-plan-options/HMO">health maintenance organization</a>, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-02-08-fi-1192-story.html">converted to a for-profit insurance company</a> in 1992, regulators required that 80% of its equity be transferred to another <a href="https://www.calwellness.org/mission/our-story/">nonprofit health foundation</a>. Unlike with OpenAI, the foundation had majority control after the transformation.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.eyesonopenai.org/">coalition of California nonprofits</a> has argued that the attorney general should require OpenAI to transfer all of its assets to an independent nonprofit.  </p>

<p>Another example is <a href="https://www.lenfestinstitute.org/our-work/the-philadelphia-inquirer/">The Philadelphia Inquirer</a>. The Pennsylvania newspaper <a href="https://current.org/2016/04/as-philadelphia-newspapers-turn-to-nonprofits-who-is-public-media/">became a for-profit public benefit corporation</a> in 2016. It belongs to the Lenfest Institute, a nonprofit.</p>

<p>This structure allows Philadelphia’s biggest newspaper to attract investment without compromising its purpose – journalism serving the needs of its local communities. It’s become a model for potentially <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/commentary/press-forward-lenfest-institute-journalism-philanthropy-american-democracy-20230907.html">transforming the local news industry</a>. </p>

<p>At this point, I believe that the public bears the burden of two governance failures. One is that OpenAI’s board has apparently abandoned its mission of safety. And the other is that the attorneys general of California and Delaware have let that happen.</p>
