<p><strong>Freezing Solid</strong></p>
<p>The most remarkable thing about wood frogs happens not in the summer when they transform from tadpoles to frogs, but in the winter when they hibernate.</p>
<p>The northern forests of Alaska and Canada have some of the most dramatic temperature ranges in the world. Summer days stretch to 24 hours and temperatures can climb into the 90’s. Winter brings some of the earth’s coldest temperatures: it is not unusual to have temperatures of minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Prospect Creek, just south of the Brooks Range, had the coldest temperature ever recorded in Alaska—minus 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Almost certainly, there were hibernating wood frogs near Prospect Creek when that record was set.</p>
<p>This is the winter world in which the wood frog must survive. Remember, frogs are cold blooded, so their body temperature is about the same as the surrounding air. How do these delicate little creatures endure the intense, protracted, iron-cold subarctic winter?</p>
<p>This mystery has intrigued scientists for a long time. Biologists have studied wood frog hibernation and what they’ve learned is truly astonishing.</p>
<p>Most frogs survive northern winters by hibernating deep under water, in ponds, lakes and streams—they are cold and dormant but their body temperature never falls below freezing.</p>
<p>Wood frogs have a different strategy. They hibernate by nestling down into the leafy litter on the forest floor. The leaves, duff and overlying snow give some insulation from extreme cold, but the frogs are not protected from subfreezing temperatures as they would be if they chose the underwater strategy.</p>
</div><div id="cs_control_1008228">
<p>Researchers have found that wood frogs spend the winter frozen! This amazing strategy allows wood frogs to become active very early in spring, because the land thaws and warms more quickly than the ice-covered lakes The newly active frogs can mate and lay eggs in small ponds and even in melt water pools that dry up by midsummer. By contrast, frogs that hibernate underwater take longer to become active, so they must breed later. These frogs need permanent water that won’t dry out.</p>
<p>For most other animals, survival depends on protecting themselves from any condition that could freeze their flesh. Why is freezing so dangerous? Several things can happen: If ice crystals form inside an animal they can puncture blood vessels. When blood freezes, there is no mechanism to deliver oxygen and nutrients to organs, so extreme metabolic damage occurs. And ice severely injures cells by drawing out water and causing dehydration, scrambling the interior structure of cells and fracturing the cell walls. The result is pervasive and deadly internal damage.</p>
</div><div id="cs_control_1008230">
<p>Yet wood frogs have evolved ways to freeze solid for up to eight months each year. They’ve accomplished what would seem to be a biological miracle. How do they pull this off?</p>
<p>At the beginning of winter, ice quickly fills the wood frog’s abdominal cavity and encases the internal organs. Ice crystals form between layers of skin and muscle. The eyes turn white because the lens freezes.</p>
<p>At the same time, the wood frog’s liver produces large amounts of glucose that flushes into every cell in its body. This syrupy sugar solution prevents the cells from freezing and binds the water molecules inside the cells to prevent dehydration.</p>
<p>So on the one hand, the wood frog’s body allows ice to form around the <em>outsides</em> of cells and organs; and on the other hand, it prevents ice from forming <em>inside</em> the cells--thus avoiding the lethal damage suffered by most animals when they freeze.</p>
<p>What does a hibernating wood frog look like? There is no muscle movement. No heartbeat. No breathing. For the entire winter, the wood frog is like a lump of hard, frigid, icy stone carved in the shape of a frog. But it’s alive, in a state of suspended animation.</p>
<p>In spring, the wood frog thaws from the inside outward. First the heart starts beating. Then the brain activates. Finally, the legs move.</p>
<p>Nobody yet understands what starts the wood frog’s heart after being frozen and inert for the entire northern winter. Once the frog is fully thawed, it heads off through the woods to find a breeding pond or other suitable water.</p>
<p>The wood frog is completely undamaged by conditions that would be fatal to nearly all other animals.</p>
</div><div id="cs_control_1008244">
<p><span color="#000000"><strong><span><strong><span><strong><span><strong>Wood Frogs and Humans</strong></span></strong></span></strong></span></strong></span></p>
<p>Glucose in the wood frog's blood keeps it from freezing during the extreme arctic winter temperatures. This is the same as the blood sugar in all vertebrate animals, including humans.</p>
<p>Hibernating wood frogs can tolerate blood sugar levels 100 times higher than normal without the damage suffered by human diabetics when their blood sugar is only 2 to 10 times above normal. Understanding how frogs can do this might provide valuable knowledge to help in the management of high blood sugar in people with diabetes.</p>
<p>Also, the wood frog's ability to withstand freezing may help researchers discover how human organs used for transplants could be frozen and thawed without damage. This would increase the allowable time between removing an organ from a donor and implanting it within the recipient, which could make many more transplants possible.</p>
<p>Researchers are also interested in how the wood frog's body can stop blood circulation and start it again many months later without blood clots or other injuries. Understanding the mechanism which allows this could be valuable for treating people after their blood flow is temporarily halted by heart attack or stroke.</p>

    <p>Let’s talk about tech interviews – specifically, the ones that go overboard with unrealistic coding assignments. If you’re a developer who’s been asked to debug legacy PHP or build a mini-app from scratch in just a few hours, you know what I’m talking about. It’s becoming a trend, and it’s not helping anyone.</p>
<h2 id="unrealistic-tests-that-dont-measure-real-skills">Unrealistic Tests That Don’t Measure Real Skills</h2><p>These high-stress, solo coding assignments don’t reflect the actual job. Instead, they put developers in situations they’d never face in the workplace, where collaboration and support are standard. When was the last time you had to debug an ancient codebase without documentation or help from a team? Yet companies claim this somehow measures “problem-solving” skills.</p>
<p>What companies often ignore is the extra time candidates invest beyond the “suggested time” for these tests. Developers don’t just jump into an assignment; they research the company, study the job requirements, and meticulously work to polish the project. A “4-hour” assignment can quickly turn into 8, 10, or even more, just to ensure it’s in great shape. For developers balancing jobs and life, this can feel like working unpaid shifts for a job they don’t even have yet.</p>
<h2 id="the-flexibility-myth">The Flexibility Myth</h2><p>Many companies justify these tests by saying they need “adaptable” developers, even if the tech stack has nothing to do with the role. This is like asking a Ruby developer to debug PHP as a test of flexibility. Sure, adaptability is important, but that doesn’t mean a candidate’s worth should be based on their ability to tackle obscure, unrelated challenges.</p>
<h2 id="are-companies-testing-candidates-or-just-flexing">Are Companies Testing Candidates or Just Flexing?</h2><p>For some companies, these tests feel like a way to show off how “elite” their standards are rather than truly evaluating fit. There’s an inflated “top 1%” mentality where every hire has to jump through hoops, even if those hoops don’t make sense. This turns away skilled candidates who could do the job well but don’t thrive in these artificial, high-pressure situations.</p>
<h2 id="time-for-a-reality-check">Time for a Reality Check</h2><p>It’s time for companies to admit these interview practices are broken. If the job requires specific tech skills, test those skills. But don’t put candidates through unrealistic coding boot camps that don’t reflect the role’s actual needs.</p>
<p>Hiring processes should focus on problem-solving, collaboration, and growth in relevant areas. Unrealistic expectations don’t attract the best talent – they just exhaust and discourage it. If companies want adaptable developers, they should focus on the long-term ability to learn, not how fast someone can tackle an arbitrary test. Dropping these absurd assignments and focusing on what really counts could foster a better, more inclusive tech culture.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>Some Norwegian fishermen off the coast of Tromsø were out and about on their vessel named Øygutt looking for halibut. Something significantly larger than fish, however, found its way into their trawl net. The fishermen <a href="https://www.thebarentsobserver.com/security/norwegian-fishermen-snagged-us-nuclearpowered-submarine/420357?ICID=ref_fark">caught the USS Virginia</a>, a 115-meter-long nuclear-powered attack submarine outfitted with cruise missiles.</p>





<p>The ship’s crew, made up entirely of young men in their 20s, had no idea that the USS Virginia had been dragging its net for two nautical miles before its crew realized what was going on and cut it loose. </p>

<p>

			</p>



<p>The USS Virginia, a US naval ship, was sailing near the surface when its propeller snagged a part of the fishing net. The fishermen were unaware of it until they were contacted by the US Coast Guard. They were on the way to a new spot hoping to catch more halibut, all the while blissfully ignorant to the fact that their net was now being dragged away by the setting for several excellent ’90s military thrillers.</p>







<p>The US Embassy in Oslo later confirmed the incident and that the submarine was operating in the area. The U.S. Navy uses the waters around Norway as a hub for resupply and crew changes in NATO’s ongoing surveillance of Russian naval activities. </p>



<p>Russian subs are regularly deployed from the Kola Peninsula in the northern Atlantic in the United States and NATO has a vested interest in understanding what the Russkies are up to with their super silent modern submarines. Hopefully, all these wargames can keep the fishermen out of it — which is apparently rather difficult.</p>



<p>You see, this isn’t the first time this has happened. A quick Google search brought up an article archived by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/20/world/soviet-submarine-is-trapped-by-norwegian-fishing-wire.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Times</a>, seemingly originally published by UPI, titled “Soviet Submarine Is Trapped By Norwegian Fishing Wire.” The article dates back to June 20, 1984.</p>







<p>The short blurb tells the story of a Soviet sub trapped in the fishing wire of a Norwegian trawler for 3 ½ hours. The lesson here is that as long as the US and Russia are butting heads, Norwegian fishing boats will always get caught in the middle. Keep your Cold War the hell away from innocent Norwegian fishermen!</p>

Despite not encountering any resistance from the population, due to a perceived counter-attack, German troops soon began a massacre of murder, pillaging, arson and other war crimes towards the town’s civilian population. Over the course of five days 248 civilians were killed, most of the town’s remaining 10,000 residents exiled, 1,500 deported and some 2,000 homes, including about 1/6th of the town’s structures destroyed. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg" width="1456" height="1057" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1057,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2777122,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40e6fbd9-0bd0-4436-9e32-8cb1e176797e_5223x3793.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Ruins of the university library at Louvain (Photo: Library of Congress)</figcaption></figure></div><p>Among the buildings lost during the atrocities was the Central Hall and University Library of the Katholieke Universiteit te Leuven.

Every German would of course greatly regret if in the course of this terrible war any works of art should already have been destroyed or be destroyed at some future time, but inasmuch as in our great love for art we cannot be surpassed by any other nation, in the same degree we must decidedly refuse to buy a German defeat at the cost of saving a work of art.”</span></em></p></blockquote><p><span>Of the 93 signatories to the text, 21 were natural scientists and four were Solvay Prize winners</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-143631216" href="https://www.privatdozent.co/p/the-battle-line-at-louvain-1914#footnote-4-143631216" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span><span> (MacLeod, 2018).

The letter, signed 'British Scholars’ opens as follows:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“We see with regret the names of many German professors and men of science, whom we regard with respect and, in some cases, with personal friendship, appended to a denunciation of Great Britain so utterly baseless that we can hardly believe that it expresses their spontaneous or considered opinion. We do not question for a moment their personal sincerity when they express their horror of war and their zeal for "the achievements of culture." Yet we are bound to point out that a very different view of war, and of national aggrandizement based on the threat of war, has been advocated by such influential writers as Nietzsche, von Treitschke, von Bülow, and von Bernhardi, and has received widespread support from the press and from public opinion in Germany. This has not occurred, and in our judgment would scarcely be possible, in any other civilized country. We must also remark that it is German armies alone which have, at the present time, deliberately destroyed or bombarded such monuments of human culture as the Library at Louvain and the Cathedrals at Rheims and Malines.”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>In proper English fashion, their text ends with the polite expression of their </span><em>“real and deep admiration for German scholarship and science”</em><span>, ending:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“We have many ties with Germany, ties of comradeship, of respect, and of affection. We grieve profoundly that, under the baleful influence of a military system and its lawless dreams of conquest, she whom we once honored now stands revealed as the common enemy of Europe and of all peoples which respect the law of nations. </em></p></blockquote><p>No less influenced by the official line in British politics at the time than those of their German counterparts, the 117 British scientists thus took a stand to too support the war, as their colleagues in Germany had done weeks prior, writing:</p><blockquote><p><em>We must carry on the war on which we have entered. For us, as for Belgium, it is a war of defense, waged for liberty and peace.”</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>“The ‘two Germanies’ of music and beauty, and of iron and blood were dissolved into one, dominated by war.” — (</em><span>MacLeod, 2018)</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Not all the intellectuals approached by Fulda accepted his invitation to sign the German manifesto, and some who did were not aware of what they were signing. Notably absent was </span><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/t/Einstein" rel="">Albert Einstein</a><span> (1879-1955), who in 1915 would instead sign his name to a pacifist counter-manifesto referred to as the </span><em>Aufruf an die Europäer</em><span> (“Manifesto of the Europeans”). Another name that was notably absent was prominent mathematician </span><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/t/Hilbert" rel="">David Hilbert</a><span> (1862-1943), who distrusted Fulda’s motives and refused to sign. This did not go unnoticed by the German propaganda machine, and when Hilbert’s classes at Göttingen resumed in November of 1914, his students turned away from him, as if he were a traitor (Reid, 1970). Among those who later claimed not to know what they were signing were Planck, Fischer and Klein (Wolff, 2003). Planck, for instance, had been traveling and without knowing the formulation of the text authorized his children to sign it on his behalf. Astronomer Wilhelm J. Foerster (1832-1921), whose signature may have been added without his permission, soon rescinded his endorsement and set to work on the “</span><em>Manifesto of the Europeans”</em><span>, which he co-authored with Georg Friedrich Nicolai (1874-1964). Others notable for refusing to sign the manifest was composer Richard Strauss (1864-1949) , who later wrote that </span><em>“declarations about war and politics are not fitting for an artist”</em><span> (Strauss &amp; Rolland, 1968).</span></p><p><span>Among those who did sign the document and remained proud to endorse it was Wilhelm Wien, a renowned German physicist and professor in Würzburg who three years prior had won the Nobel Prize in Physics </span><em>“for his discoveries regarding the laws governing the radiation of heat”</em><span>. Motivated by national and conservative leanings and his perceived failure of </span><em>Manifest der 93</em><span> Wien, in late 1914 he took it upon himself to </span><em>“take a stand against the unbelievable lies from abroad” </em><span>(Wolff, 2003) by drafting a proclamation (“aufforderung”) against the “Englishness” (Engländerei) influencing German physics. The translated text is available in its entirety below:</span></p><pre><code><strong>Proclamation</strong><span>
Because of the war, the relations of physical scientists to enemy countries will undergo revision. This will effect our relationship with England particularly in view of the hostile declaration drafted by English scholars without any understanding of the German mind and signed by eight well-known English physicists (Bragg, Crookes, Fleming, Lamb, Lodge, Ramsay, Rayleigh, J. J. Thomson).

Two lines of the signatures are missing now! It has been demonstrated by their action that the long-standing efforts to reach a better mutual understanding with the English have failed and cannot be resumed in the foreseeable future. The steps we have taken in the interest of a rapprochement between the scientific communities of both peoples are no longer justified. Thus, we must eliminate the unjustified English influence on German physics.

Naturally, this does not mean a rejection of English scientific ideas and suggestions. But the frequently criticized “Ausländerei” of the Germans has become so evident in our science that it appears necessary to draw attention to it. 

On this basis we limit ourselves for now to propose that all physicists observe the following rules:

1. In citing the literature, the English should no longer receive greater consideration than our countrymen, as has happened often in the past;

2. German physicists should no longer publish in English journals, except to respond;

3. Publishers should only accept scientific works written in German and
translations only if, in the opinion of experts, the translated works are particularly important contributions to the literature;

4. Government money is not to be used for translations.

Formulated </span><em>not</em><span> as a counter-manifesto to the British, but rather, as a </span><em>“self-education”</em><span> targeted towards German-speaking physicists, the proclamation was printed in 700 copies which were sent out to German and Austrian universities in March of 1915 (Wolff, 2003).</span></p><p><span>By 1921 a report in The New York Times found that of the 76 surviving signatories to the ‘Manifest der 93’, 60 expressed varying degrees of regret for signing. Some of the signatories, two in particular, remained devoted to the contents of </span><em>Manifest der 93</em><span>, Wien’s </span><em>Aufforderung </em><span>and indeed, extreme extension to them. Although Wien occasionally expressed racist sentiments in the years following the Treaty of Versailles, he did so in private rather than public and always with a measure of restraint, as in this personal note to Lenard (Wolff, 2003):</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“I also agree that the Semitic influence should be stemmed, but without that ‘Spektakelantisemitismus’ (“anti-Semitic uproar”) from which nothing positive will result.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Wien did not reject Einstein’s theory of relativity and indeed nominated both Einstein and Lorentz for the Nobel Prize in 1918.</p><p>Lenard and Stark on the other hand, as early as the 1920s began supporting Adolf Hitler publicly. Their legacy, tarnished by this support and their pursuit of the “German physics” would later fail and be supplanted by the work of another German physicist, Werner Heisenberg (1901-76) who would go on to employ “Jewish physics” in the German nuclear weapons program, which was initiated in 1939.</p><p><span>To this day, the burning of the library in Louvain remains a battle line, which we should be wary to ever cross again, for as Heinrich Heine (1797-1856) so eloquently once stated,  </span><em>“where they burn books, they will also burn people”.</em></p><div data-component-name="DigestPostEmbed"><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/p/when-einstein-met-churchill-1933" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45eb2334-cdf8-4458-ba9f-8ec404be1c07_651x466.jpeg"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45eb2334-cdf8-4458-ba9f-8ec404be1c07_651x466.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="When Einstein met Churchill (1933)" width="140" height="140"></picture></div></a></div><div data-component-name="DigestPostEmbed"><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/p/einsteins-emigration-to-america-1932" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35c6b4b6-0051-4180-a3c6-464ea4c8a072_906x698.jpeg"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35c6b4b6-0051-4180-a3c6-464ea4c8a072_906x698.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="Einstein's Emigration to America (1932)" width="140" height="140"></picture></div></a></div><div data-component-name="DigestPostEmbed"><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/p/when-heisenberg-met-einstein" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59068a3e-4737-4b3d-8660-7c00d84209a5_1456x1021.png"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59068a3e-4737-4b3d-8660-7c00d84209a5_1456x1021.png" sizes="100vw" alt="When Heisenberg met Einstein" width="140" height="140"></picture></div></a></div><p><span>At the time of the writing of this essay, the </span><em>Privatdozent</em><span> newsletter goes out to 11,779 subscribers via Substack.</span></p><p><strong>Derez, M., 2016</strong><span>.

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Open Dialog</h2><a id="user-content-open-dialog" aria-label="Permalink: Open Dialog" href="#open-dialog"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When the open executable dialog is invoked, it looks like this:

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Seer Console</h2><a id="user-content-seer-console" aria-label="Permalink: Seer Console" href="#seer-console"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">All text output from the executable will go to the Seer console. Text input for the executable can be entered via the console too.
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/epasveer/seer/blob/main/images/console.png"><img src="https://github.com/epasveer/seer/raw/main/images/console.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Assembly View</h2><a id="user-content-assembly-view" aria-label="Permalink: Assembly View" href="#assembly-view"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Normally Seer will just show the source code as tabs in the Code Manager. The program's assembly can also be show as a tab.</p>
<p dir="auto">Select "View-&gt;Assembly View" and an extra tab will be shown alongside the source code tabs that shows the current assembly being executed. Here is an example.
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/epasveer/seer/blob/main/images/mainview_assemby.png"><img src="https://github.com/epasveer/seer/raw/main/images/mainview_assemby.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Like the source code tabs, breakpoints can be set in the assembly tab. The current instruction is highlighted.</p>
<p dir="auto">Double-clicking on entries in the "Breakpoints" tab and the "Stack frames" tab will show the assembly for those addresses.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are "Nexti" and "Stepi" hot-keys, as defined by your config settings. Normally "Ctrl+F5" and "CTRL+F6".
Using "^F" in the assembly tab will show a powerful search bar.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>The assembly feature in Seer is new. Feel free to suggest changes/features.</strong></p>

<p dir="auto">When looking at the contents of a C/C++ struct or a C++ class in the Struct Visualizer, it looks like this.
This example shows the contents of "*this" for the current C++ class that Seer is in. All structure members
that are basic types can be edited.</p>

<p dir="auto">Seer is meant to easily start the program to debug from the command line. gdb has multiple
methods for debugging a program. So Seer naturally does too.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Apple’s new iPhone software comes with a novel security feature that reboots the phone if it’s not unlocked for 72 hours, according to security researchers.</p>

<p>Last week, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.404media.co/police-freak-out-at-iphones-mysteriously-rebooting-themselves-locking-cops-out/">404 Media reported</a> that law enforcement officers and forensic experts were concerned that some iPhones were rebooting themselves under mysterious circumstances, which made it harder for them to get access to the devices and extract data. Citing security researchers, 404 Media <a href="https://www.404media.co/police-freak-out-at-iphones-mysteriously-rebooting-themselves-locking-cops-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">later reported</a> that iOS 18 had a new “inactivity reboot” feature that forced the devices to restart.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Now we know exactly how long it takes for this feature to kick in.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Jiska Classen, a researcher at the Hasso Plattner Institute and one of the first security experts to spot this new feature, <a href="https://x.com/naehrdine/status/1856802400897503487" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published a video</a> demonstrating the “inactivity reboot” feature. The video shows that an iPhone left alone without being unlocked reboots itself after 72 hours.</p>

<p>Magnet Forensics, a company that provides digital forensic products including the iPhone and Android data extraction tool Graykey, <a href="https://www.magnetforensics.com/blog/understanding-the-security-impacts-of-ios-18s-inactivity-reboot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">also confirmed</a> that the timer for the feature is 72 hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Inactivity reboot” effectively puts iPhones in a more secure state by locking the user’s encryption keys in the iPhone’s secure enclave chip.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Even if thieves leave your iPhone powered on for a long time, they won’t be able to unlock it with cheaper, outdated forensic tooling,” Classen wrote on X. “While inactivity reboot makes it more challenging for law enforcement to get data from devices of criminals, this won’t lock them out completely. Three days is still plenty of time when coordinating steps with professional analysts.”</p>

<p>iPhones have two different states that can affect the ability of law enforcement, forensic experts, or hackers, to unlock them by brute-forcing the user’s passcode, or extracting data by exploiting security flaws in the iPhone software. These two states are “Before First Unlock,” or BFU, and “After First Unlock,” or AFU. </p>

<p>When the iPhone is in BFU state, the user’s data on their iPhone is fully encrypted and near-impossible to access, unless the person trying to get in knows the user’s passcode. In AFU state, on the other hand, certain data is unencrypted and may be easier to extract by some device forensic tools — even if the phone is locked.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An iPhone security researcher who goes by Tihmstar told TechCrunch that the iPhones in those two states are also referred to as “hot” or “cold” devices.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Tihmstar said that many forensic companies focus on “hot” devices in an AFU state, because at some point the user entered their correct passcode, which is stored in the memory of the iPhone’s secure enclave. By contrast, “cold” devices are far more difficult to compromise because their memory cannot be easily extracted once the phone restarts.</p>

<p>For years, Apple has added new security features that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/22/the-fbi-is-mad-because-it-keeps-getting-into-locked-iphones-without-apples-help/">law enforcement have opposed and spoken out against</a>, arguing that they are making their job harder. In 2016, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/13/why-apple-is-right-to-resist-the-fbi/">FBI took Apple to court</a> in an effort to force the company to build a backdoor to unlock the iPhone of a mass-shooter. Eventually, the Australian startup Azimuth Security <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/14/azimuth-san-bernardino-apple-iphone-fbi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">helped the FBI</a> hack into the phone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apple did not respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
                <h2 id="what-pep740">What is PEP 740?</h2>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0740/">PEP 740</a> is a Python standard
                    for defining cryptographically verifiable attestations hosted by indices like
                    PyPI.
                </p>
                <h2 id="what">What are attestations?</h2>
                <p>
                    Attestations are digitally signed, publicly verifiable statements about Python
                    packages, including their <em>provenance</em> (e.g., the exact source repository
                    that produced them).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Attestations are built on top of <a href="https://sigstore.dev/">Sigstore</a>
                    and use short-lived signing keys bound to trusted identities
                    (like <a href="https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/">Trusted Publishers</a>),
                    making them misuse-resistant and less susceptible to key loss and theft.
                </p>
                <h2 id="about-list">What is this list?</h2>
                <p>This site shows the top 360 most-downloaded packages on <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a> showing which have been uploaded with attestations.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Green</span> packages <span id="success-percent"></span> with a 🔏 offer attestations for verification</li>
                    <li><span>Uncolored</span> packages <span id="default-percent"></span> with a ⏰ were last uploaded before attestations were available</li>
                    <li><span>Yellow</span> packages <span id="todo-percent"></span> have no attestations uploaded (yet!)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Packages that are known to be deprecated are not included (for example, distribute). If your package is incorrectly listed, please <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/are-we-pep740-yet/issues/">create a ticket</a>.</p>
                <h2 id="creating-wheels">My package is uncolored. What can I do?</h2>
                <p>
                    Using a Trusted Publisher is the easiest way to enable attestations, since they come baked in!
                    See <a href="https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/adding-a-publisher/">the PyPI user docs</a>
                    and <a href="https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish">official PyPA publishing action</a>
                    to get started.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For projects already using the official PyPA publishing action, you can upgrade to <a href="https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish/releases/tag/v1.11.0">v1.11.0</a> or later
                    to automatically enable attestations for the next release of the project. We recommend upgrading to the latest version of the action to receive any bug fixes.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
<section id="matrix-client-tutorial">

<div>
<p>Warning</p>
<p>This book is a work in progress.  Most of the information that it contains
should be correct, but it is not complete.</p>
</div>
<p>Welcome to the Matrix.  <a href="https://matrix.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Matrix</a> is an open protocol for
decentralised communication.  Matrix allows users on different servers to
communicate with each other, similar to how people on different email servers
can email each other.</p>
<p>This book is an introduction to creating a client using the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/client-server-api/#" rel="nofollow noopener">Matrix
Client-Server API</a>.  It will show how to make HTTP
calls to a Matrix homeserver, and discuss issues that clients will need to
consider, such as reliability and security issues.  It does not attempt to be a
comprehensive guide to the entire Client-Server API, but will point you to the
relevant portions of spec for further details.</p>
<p>You should read this book if:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>you are creating a Matrix library/SDK,</p></li>
<li><p>you are writing a Matrix client without the use of a library/SDK, or</p></li>
<li><p>you want to get a better understanding of how Matrix works.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are creating a Matrix client using a library/SDK, some of the
information in this book may still be useful, but some things will already be
handled by your library/SDK.</p>
<p>We assume that you have:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>an understanding of JSON encoding,</p></li>
<li><p>an understanding of HTTP requests, including HTTP status codes, headers, and
different types of requests (<code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, etc.),</p></li>
<li><p>experience writing asynchronous code in your preferred programming language.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This book is written in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming" rel="nofollow noopener">literate
programming</a> style, which
interleaves code blocks and text.  In short, code blocks are named, and can
reference other code blocks using the syntax <code>{{other code block name}}</code>, which
will insert the code blocks with the given name in place of the reference.
Multiple code blocks can have the same name, in which case they are inserted in
the order that they appear in the book (though in many cases, the order does
not matter).  This allows us to, for example, have a reference such as <code>{{class Foo methods}}</code>, and define the methods of the <code>Foo</code> class in multiple chunks.</p>
<p>The code output of this book will be a library that a Matrix client could use.
The actual user interface for a client is out of scope for this book, although
for some topics, there may be discussion on how clients may wish to display
things to the user.</p>
<p>The code is written in Python using <a href="https://docs.aiohttp.org/" rel="nofollow noopener"><code>aiohttp</code></a>, but
the rest of the content should apply any other programming languages and most
of the code should be easy to port to another language.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>The main purpose of the example code here is to illustrate how the Matrix
Client-Server API is used, rather than to develop a fully-featured library.
While the library generated should be usable for simple situations, it may make
some tradeoffs differently from what a “real” Matrix library would make.  These
tradeoffs will be discussed in the text where appropriate.</p>
</div>
<p>The source for this book, including the example code, is available at
<a href="https://gitlab.com/uhoreg/matrix-tutorial" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gitlab.com/uhoreg/matrix-tutorial</a>.  We will call our Matrix library
the very unimaginative name <code>matrixlib</code>.</p>
<div data-controller="code"><pre><code><span># {{copyright}}</span>

<span>"""Matrix client library example"""</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The main entry point for our library will be a <code>client</code> module.  It will
contain helper functions and a <a href="https://uhoreg.gitlab.io/matrix-tutorial/client.html"><span><code>Client</code> class</span></a>, representing a
client connection.</p>

<p>In the first chapter of this book, we will discover the basics of the Matrix
Client-Server API.  We will learn how to make requests to the homeserver, log
in and out, and send and receive messages.  Using this, we will create a simple
echo bot.</p>

            <pubDate>Thu, 14 Nov 2024 22:23:09 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://legiscope.com/blog/hidden-productivity-drain-cookie-banners.html">https://legiscope.com/blog/hidden-productivity-drain-cookie-banners.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42141843">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Cookie banners have become a pervasive feature of the modern web, frustrating users who seek a seamless browsing experience. In Europe, consent banners are mandated by an old directive from 2002, the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32002L0058">ePrivacy Directive 2002/58</a>, which requires websites to obtain informed consent before storing or accessing information on users’ devices. While the intention behind these regulations is to enhance privacy protection, the actual impact on user privacy is insignificant, as most cookie banners are used to facilitate web analytics, understand user behavior, manage ad efficiency, or keyword traffic. Moreover, actively tracking a user beyond their visit to a website is difficult or borderline impossible for website owners, as it would require a court order.</p>
<p>Understanding the true cost of these consent prompts in the European economy is therefore necessary. Our calculations reveal that collectively, Europeans <strong>spend over 575 million hours annually on consent prompts</strong>. At a time when the European economy faces significant challenges in competitiveness compared to the US and China <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ias1Glgi5SE">as recently highlighted by President Macron</a>, it is crucial to examine the data and the legal framework that underpins these requirements.</p>
<h2>The Productivity Cost of Cookie Banners</h2>
<p>To grasp the profound impact of cookie banners on European productivity and the economy, we need to break down the calculations. Starting with the total population of the European Union in 2024, which is approximately <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/w/ddn-20240711-1">449.2 million people</a>, we assume an <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Digital_society_statistics_at_regional_level&amp;oldid=630715#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20the%20share%20of,or%20in%20cities%20(94.9%25).">internet penetration rate of around 90%</a>, resulting in 404.28 million internet users.</p>
<p>On average, a user visits <a href="https://bloggingwizard.com/website-statistics/#:~:text=On%20average%20internet%20users%20in,pages%20on%20a%20daily%20basis.">about 100 websites per month</a>, totaling 1,200 websites per year. With about 85% of these websites displaying a cookie banner, a user will encounter about 1,020 cookie banners every year. Assuming it takes an average of 5 seconds per interaction with a cookie banner, this amounts to 5,100 seconds per year per user, or roughly 1.42 hours per year.</p>
<p>Multiplying this by the total number of internet users in the EU, we reach the following total time: 404.28 million users × 1.42 hours/year ≈ <strong>575 million hours/year</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Note: “Other Countries” encompass the remaining European Union nations.</em></p>
<p>To translate the lost time into economic terms, we can assign a monetary value to the hours spent on cookie banners. With an average hourly wage in Europe of €25, the total economic cost can be calculated as 575,000,000 hours × €25/hour = <strong>€14.375 billion</strong>. Considering the EU Annual GDP (2024) of approximately €15 trillion, the economic cost of cookie banners represents: (€14.375 billion ÷ €15 trillion) × 100 ≈ <strong>0.10% of total EU GDP</strong>.</p>
<p>To grasp the scale of the productivity loss, we can consider the number of full-time employees (FTEs) that represent the lost hours. Assuming a full-time worker dedicates approximately 2,000 hours annually, 575,000,000 hours ÷ 2,000 hours/FTE = <strong>287,500 FTEs</strong>. This means the <strong>overall cost of clicking on cookie banners is equivalent to a company of 287,500 employees spending an 8-hour workday clicking on cookie banners</strong>.</p>
<h2>Do Cookie Banners Really Improve Privacy?</h2>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, cookie banners were not introduced by the GDPR but by the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32002L0058">ePrivacy Directive 2002/58</a>, at a time when cookies were just becoming known to the public. In response to fears of global surveillance, regulators imposed a general principle of consent before any data could be stored on a user’s communication devices:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Art. 5.3: Member States shall ensure that the use of electronic communications networks to store information or to gain access to information stored in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user is only allowed on condition that the subscriber or user concerned is provided with clear and comprehensive information in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC, inter alia about the purposes of the processing, and is offered the right to refuse such processing by the data controller.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ePrivacy Directive was intended to be updated, but the project never materialized.</p>
<p>Today, most cookie banners are used by organizations to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facilitate web analytics and understand user interactions with their websites.</li>
<li>Improve user experience by analyzing what content performs well or poorly.</li>
<li>Manage the performance of advertisements.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the most part, small businesses use cookies efficiently without precise user identification. Identifying users typically requires a court order to process IP addresses, which is rarely pursued. Therefore, cookie banners primarily serve to mitigate theoretical legal risks rather than enforce extensive user tracking.</p>
<p>It is not to say that some businesses do not use cookies to operate user tracking on a massive scale. Some companies relying exclusively on advertising do share user data with very large pools of partners—sometimes hundreds of ad partners. In that case, cookie banners do offer privacy protections for users.</p>
<p>However, looking at the general scale of the internet, only a very small fraction of websites use mass-scale partnerships as their main economic model.</p>
<p>For users, repeated interactions with cookie banners lead to significant frustration and complete loss of vigilance. The consent fatigue results in users mindlessly accepting terms without proper consideration, thereby undermining the very intent of the regulations. The constant barrage of consent prompts not only reduces productivity but diminishes user satisfaction and erodes trust in online platforms.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The realization that <strong>Europeans spend 575 million hours annually clicking on cookie banners</strong> highlights a significant, yet often overlooked, economic and productivity drain. These processes deliver minimal privacy benefits and little enhancement to business performance.</p>
<p>In contrast, regulations like the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj">GDPR</a> impose IT security obligations that, while seen as burdensome, contribute to long-term business robustness by ensuring the security of IT systems.</p>
<p>This situation calls for an urgent revision of the ePrivacy Directive—potentially transforming it into a regulation to ensure swift adoption. Exemptions from cookie banners for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) using analytics, tracking user interactions on their websites, and managing basic advertising are imperative to mitigate unnecessary economic and productivity losses.</p>

	<h2>2023 CHM Fellow</h2>
<p>With deep sadness, we say goodbye to computer pioneer Thomas Kurtz.</p>
<p>Thomas Eugene Kurtz (Feb. 22 1928–Nov. 12, 2024) was an American mathematician, computer scientist and co-inventor, with John Kemeny, of the BASIC programming language and Dartmouth Timesharing System.</p>
<p>In the early days of academic computing in the 1960s, there were no simple non-professional programming languages available for undergraduates. BASIC was aimed at this audience. To realize their vision, Kurtz and Kemeny concurrently developed the Dartmouth Timesharing System, allowing BASIC to be accessed by students around campus using Teletype terminals.</p>
<h2>Finding a Calling</h2>
<p>Born in Oak Park Illinois, Kurtz graduated from Knox College in 1950, and received his PhD in mathematics from Princeton University in 1956. In 1951, Kurtz was fortunate in obtaining rare experience on a computer—the pioneering SWAC machine created by the National Bureau of Standards and housed at UCLA. SWAC, the Standards Western Automatic Computer, was among the earliest electronic computers in the United States and was supervised by legendary computer pioneer and 2013 CHM Fellow Harry Huskey.</p>
<p>Kurtz began teaching at Dartmouth upon receiving his PhD. After a few years, he and fellow professor John Kemeny developed the original version of the Dartmouth Timesharing System (DTSS), a method of sharing computer access across a network and a requirement for allowing multiple students access to BASIC.</p>

<p>DTSS was the earliest successful, large-scale timesharing system, a remarkable achievement. General Electric, which had donated computers to Dartmouth, extended DTSS into the kernel of their online services, such as Genie. DTSS was unveiled on May 1, 1964, along with BASIC. By that fall, hundreds of students were exploring BASIC on the 20 terminals around campus.</p>

<h2>Making an Impact</h2>
<p>Since its inception, the BASIC language has flourished across multiple generations of computers—from mainframes and minicomputers in the 1960s, to microcomputers in the 1970s and ‘80s to the credit-card sized Raspberry Pi computer of today. In 1978, Harvard students Bill Gates and Paul Allen wrote their first version of BASIC for a new hobbyist-oriented microcomputer, the MITS Altair 8800. Their version of BASIC turned the Altair from a blinking box with few capabilities into a useful computer, and BASIC’s popularity skyrocketed again during the personal computer era.</p>
<h2>A Storied Career</h2>
<p>From 1966 to 1975, Kurtz served as the director of the Kiewit Computation Center at Dartmouth and as director of the Office of Academic Computing from 1975 to 1978. In 1979, he and Stephen J. Garland organized a professional master's program in Computer and Information Systems, funded in part with a grant from IBM.</p>
<p>In 1983, Kurtz joined Kemeny and three former Dartmouth students in forming True BASIC, Inc., whose purpose was to develop quality educational software and a platform-independent BASIC compiler. Upon termination of the CIS program in 1988, Kurtz returned to teaching and retired from Dartmouth in 1993.</p>
<p>Kurtz served as council chairman and trustee of EDUCOM and on the so-called Pierce Panel of the President's Advisory Committee. He also served on the steering committee for two NSF- and ARPA-supported activities and was the chair of the first CCUC conference on instructional computing. He helped form American National Standards committee X3J2, which developed the ANSI standard for BASIC, serving as chair from 1974 to 1985. Kurtz was a member of the ISO committee SC22/WG8, concerned with the international standard for BASIC, and served as its convener from 1987 to 1993. In 1994, he was inducted as a Fellow of the ACM.</p>
